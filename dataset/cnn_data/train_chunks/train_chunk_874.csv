"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A woman has spoken of the traumatic birth she endured after being turned away by a hospital’s maternity unit - only have the baby 40 minutes later in her mother’s living room. Zeenat Patel claims she was refused a second labour check by a triage nurse when she called her local hospital. Miss Patel and her partner, Yaseen Lockhat, first went to the maternity unit at Royal Bolton Hospital about 3.30pm on Thursday, July 3. Zeenat Patel claims she was repeatedly turned away from her local hospital during labour. Forty minutes after being sent home again she gave birth to baby Liyana in her mother's living room . She claims a triage nurse told her she was not in 'active' labour and advised her to go home until the contractions became more frequent. But an hour after the couple left, Miss Patel, 26, found herself in constant pain and called the maternity triage nurse at 5.50pm - and was told again to wait at home. Concerned their baby was just minutes away from being born, the couple drove back to the hospital. off for the hospital again by car. Miss Patel said: 'My labour pains were getting a lot stronger and I just knew the baby was going to come soon. 'By the time I had explained this over the phone, got cut off and got back through again, we were outside the hospital doors. 'I was told that because I was talking between contractions I couldn’t be that close, but I was in pain all the time. 'They spoke to me like I was a child, like I didn’t know my own body. 'I’d given birth before and I knew what was happening, but they wouldn't listen. We were left with no alternative but to go home.' But as soon as Mr Lockhat dropped her off at her mother’s house, she started to give birth. Miss Patel's mother, Hanifa, delivered the baby herself on the living room floor with the aid of an ambulance call-handler . 'I shut myself in the toilet and when I sat down I could feel the head,' she recalled. 'All I could do was push. I kept thinking if they had checked me, I wouldn’t be giving birth in this situation. 'I stayed in the toilet because I didn’t want my three- year-old daughter, Jasmine, to see what was happening. 'Giving birth is meant to be a special experience, but this was just traumatic.' When her mother, Hanifa, heard her daughter scream in the toilet and saw the baby’s head, she dialled 999. Mrs Patel managed to help her daughter to the living room where she delivered the baby herself at 6.30pm, with the aid of an ambulance call-handler. Mrs Patel, 54, said: 'It all happened so quickly. It was very scary. I grabbed some towels and managed to lie her down in the living room. 'It was very difficult because I had to hold the phone and catch the baby as she was born.' Baby Liyana came out with the cord around her neck but is now doing well . To make matters worse, baby Liyana came out with the cord around her neck. Mrs Patel added: 'My mother was a midwife so I remembered some of the things she had told me. Paramedics arrived 25 minutes after baby Liyana was born - weighing 6lb 2oz -  and took mother and daughter to hospital. Miss Patel said: 'I was so grateful my mum was there - I don’t know what I would have done without her. 'All I want to know is how and why this was allowed to happen. Imagine if it had been someone who didn’t have her family around her.' Sue Anderton, head of midwifery at the hospital, said: 'A senior matron met with Zeenat and her family as soon as we heard of these concerns and I followed this up and went to meet them myself.

"By . Joel Christie . The U.S. government's latest attempt to stop illegal immigrants crossing the border comes via the radio. As part of a new multi-million dollar 'Dangers Awareness Campaign', the U.S. Customs and Border Protection campaign commissioned a catchy Spanish song to be written and produced to discourage families in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador from sending their children with smugglers to cross the U.S. border through Mexico. That song - La Bestia - has subsequently become a major radio hit in Central America, with its legion of fans unaware it was created to 'teach' them something. La Bestia - translated as 'The Beast' - refers to the notoriously dangerous freight train that migrants ride from Southern Mexico - risking robbery, kidnapping, rape, and murder - just to make it to the U.S. border, reports The Daily Beast. Unaccompanied minors ride atop the wagon of a freight train, known as La Bestia (The Beast) in Ixtepec, in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. A new song widely circulated on Central American radio about the train was created by the U.S. government to subliminally dissuade migrants from crossing the border . Hundreds of thousands of migrants, mostly Central Americans, risk robbery, death from fast-moving freight trains or dehydration in the desert while trying to reach the U.S illegally . Central American migrants rest next to the train tracks while waiting for the freight train 'La Bestia', or the Beast, to travel to north Mexico to reach and cross the U.S. border . The track features lyrics such as: 'Migrants from everywhere, entrenched along the rail ties. 'Far away from where they come, further away from where they go. 'They call her the Beast from the South, this wretched train of death. 'With the devil in the boiler, whistles, roars, twists and turns.' The vocals are by Eddie Ganz - a wedding and Bar Mitzvah singer - in Spanish. The beat features a Caribbean flavor. The song is just one part of the 'Dangers Awareness Campaign' assault, with billboards and other public service announcements, such as television advertisements, to be rolled out as well. La Bestia was the brainchild of Rodolfo Hernandez, the creative director of Washington D.C. advertising agency Elevation. The song is part of a new multimillion dollar campaign by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to discourage migrants from dangerously trying to enter the country . What makes the tune somewhat propagandist is that it is played on regular rotation by radio stations without a disclaimer. This means listeners have no idea it was tailored specifically to them by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. However those leading the campaign this an important detail. They said people would not be open to the message otherwise.","'La Bestia' is a popular song about the freight train 'The Beast' that hundreds of thousands of migrants risk their lives riding to try and get into America .

"By . Joel Christie . A 26-year-old woman has become the first to be charged under controversial new laws in Tennessee that make it illegal to take drugs while pregnant, after both her and her baby tested positive for methamphetamine. Mallory Loyola was arrested as she was discharged from hospital on Tuesday, having welcomed her daughter last Sunday, later admitting to police she smoked meth just days before giving birth. The new law - introduced in the state earlier this month - states that a woman can be 'prosecuted for assault for the illegal use of a narcotic drug while pregnant', according to WATE-TV. Officials are hoping the assault charges - and now Loyola's arrest - will stop women abusing drugs during their pregnancy, however opposers say it will only cultivate troubled women not seeking proper prenatal care. Charged with assault: Mallory Loyola, 26, was arrested after her and her newborn daughter tested positive to meth . The young woman has a history of meth-related charges in Monroe Country . Loyola lives with her mother at this home in Madisonville, Tennessee . 'Anytime someone is addicted and they can't get off for their own child, their own flesh and blood, it's sad,' Monroe County Sheriff Bill Bivens told WATE-TV in Knoxville. 'Hopefully it will send a signal to other women who are pregnant and have a drug problem to seek help. 'That's what we want them to do.' The assault charge is a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail. It allows the women the choice to enter a treatment program before the birth and successfully complete it afterwards as a defense. However the offense has faced a landslide of opposition. The American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee says the law raises 'serious constitutional concerns regarding equal treatment under the law', according to ABC. 'This dangerous law unconstitutionally singles out new mothers struggling with addiction for criminal assault charges,' Thomas Castelli, legal director of the ACLU Tennessee, said in a statement. Mallory Loyola, 26 (right), was arrested this week after both she and her newborn infant tested positive for meth. Seen here in a photo from her Facebook . 'By focusing on punishing women rather than promoting healthy pregnancies, the state is only deterring women struggling with alcohol or drug dependency from seeking the pre-natal care they need.' Just before Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam signed the bill in April, Michael Botticelli, acting director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy at the time, said the federal government didn't want to 'criminalize' addiction. 'What's important is that we create environments where we're really diminishing the stigma and the barriers, particularly for pregnant women, who often have a lot of shame and guilt about their substance abuse disorders,' Botticelli said, according to The Tennessean. Mallory Loyola if the first woman to be charged under controversial new laws that make it a crime for women to take drugs while pregnant . 'We know that it's usually a much more effective treatment and less costly to our taxpayers if we make sure that we're treating folks.' Loyola was released on $2,000 bail.","Mallory Loyola, 26, of Madisonville, Tennessee, was arrested on assault charges Tuesday .

"By . Joel Christie . A teenage boy was rushed to hospital on Sunday after he and 47 others were trapped inside the renowned SeaWorld ride Skytower for four hours at the San Diego water park. Others were treated at the scene for anxiety when operators and emergency crews were finally able to bring down the 320-foot high observation tower, which is a family-friendly attraction that gives a birds-eye view of the park. Fire Department spokesman Lee Swanson said the problem was initially reported as a power failure, but they later determined it to be a mechanical malfunction. The group were stuck at about 220 feet up in the air, according to San Diego 6. Nowhere to go: A group of 48 who had gone up the Skytower observation deck on Sunday were trapped within the cabin for four hours . Skytower is one of Seaworld's staple attractions, offering views of the San Diego park and its surrounding areas . 'They had air conditioning, so it wasn't like they were sweltering in a box,' Swanson said. One 17-year-old was taken to hospital for an evaluation. There were no other injuries. SeaWorld communications director David Koontz issued a written statement thanking the riders for their patience. 'With guest safety as our top priority, park engineers spent four hours trouble-shooting the problem before restoring power to the Skytower and safely returning the 46 guests to the ride loading area,' the statement said. 'The guests were never in danger and park officials were in constant communication with them while the power failure was being addressed.

A woman had been seen in the bay, with a boat erratically circling her in the water. The lake has a 'no wake' law, so the situation was in violation of the high water declaration.

"By . Joel Christie . An investigation has found that an elementary school principal in Baltimore who suspended a seven-year-old boy for chewing a Pop Tart into the shape of a gun acted properly in her decision. However the boy's family has lawyered up, and are threatening to take the case further. Josh Welch, a second-grader at Park Elementary School, said he was trying to nibble his strawberry breakfast snack into a mountain in March 2013. But when it started to take shape he reportedly told his classmates: 'Look, I made a gun.' Principal Sandra Blondell then removed Josh from school for two days. Dangerous? Josh Welch, a seven-year-old boy from Maryland, was suspended from school for two days in March 2013 for shaping a pastry into what his teacher thought looked like a gun. He has since left the school . Unacceptable? This is a recreation of the so-called 'Pop Tart gun' Josh Welch created and which eventually had him suspended. A new report says the school acted properly . Threat: The school sent home a letter with every student informing parents that: 'A student used food to make an inappropriate gesture' Andrew Nussbaum, a lawyer who serves as a hearing examiner for several school systems surrounding Washington, submitted a 30-page report on Monday agreeing that Blondell was within her rights. 'As much as the parents want this case to be about a 'gun,' it is, rather, a case about classroom disruption from a student who has had a long history of disruptive behavior,' Nussbaum wrote in his opinion, according to CBS News. 'Had the student chewed his cereal bar into the shape of a cat and ran around the room, disrupting the classroom and making 'meow' cat sounds, the result would have been exactly the same. Robin Ficker, an attorney for the Welch family, said that Josh may have had 'minor' disciplinary problems, but suspending him was taking the issue too far. 'It seems to me that schools need, with all their expertise and experience, they need to know how to deal with seven-year-old second-graders without putting them out of the educational setting,' Ficker told CBS. 'They need to deal with them rather than just throwing in the towel. 'If they can't deal with 7-year-olds, how can they deal with 17-year-olds?' Ficker said that he intends to file exceptions to Nussbaum's report to the local school asking them to rescind the suspension. If they don't, he will file to the state school board. If that fails, they will take the case to court. 'I don't see why this child should be branded in this way,' Ficker said. 'It seems we have a lot of school personnel and they are unwilling to admit they went too far on that particular day.' Innocent: Josh, who suffers from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and enjoys art classes, said he was trying to shape the tart in a mountain .

Josh, who suffers from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and enjoys art classes, told Fox 45 at the time of his suspension that his actions were innocent. 'It . was already a rectangle and I just kept on biting it and biting it and . tore off the top and it kinda looked like a gun but it wasn't. 'All I was trying to do was turn it into a mountain but, it didn't look like a mountain really and it turned out to be a gun kinda,' the seven-year-old recalled. The boy's dad found the incident ridiculous. 'I would almost call it insanity. I mean with all the potential issues that could be dealt with at school, real threats, bullies, whatever the real issue is, it's a pastry.., Ya know?' he said. The boy's father said the school claimed Josh had said 'Bang! Bang!' while holding the pastry, according to Fox News. Josh denies that his food art was ever meant to be a gun.

"By . Paul Harris . From the air, it looks little different from any other exclusive development  in one of Britain’s most  affluent areas. Set in tranquil surroundings, the upmarket crescent of multi-million pound houses in Surrey overlooks an historic swathe of private parkland. Little wonder that couples with the means to pay up to £3.5million for a newly built mansion were keen to put their deposits down when they came up for sale. 'Little Persia': How the six houses in upmarket Kingswood Warren in Surrey could be sealed off from neighbouring homes. The identities of the new buyers are protected by a confidentiality contract . 'Stockade': This picture shows one of the large new fences which have been installed. The smaller fence in front had planning permission, the larger currently does not . Barricade: This tall fence seals off one of the houses - and does not have planning permission . Exclusive: The six houses bought by the mystery buyers cost up to £3.5million each . But shortly before contracts could be exchanged, mystery Arab buyers were allowed to gazump the would-be owners by buying four of the houses for cash. Then they bought another two neighbouring ones – and began to corral them all with fencing and barbed wire. Now neighbours in Kingswood Warren, in the grounds of a mansion formerly used as a technical research base for the BBC,  fear they will be living next to a high security ‘stockade’ created by the Gulf royal family said to be behind the purchase. Or, as one described it, a ‘Little Persia’ in the heart of leafy Surrey. Yesterday residents were embroiled in a fractious stalemate with the newcomers, whom they accused of ‘riding roughshod’ over planning laws and community spirit. Difference: The fence is considerably larger than what was allowed before . Thorny issue: Parts of the fence have been topped with barbed wire . Contacted by the Mail, an intermediary for the buyers described the complainants as ‘uncivilised people’. UK-based Jacky Saunders admitted planning permission for the fencing had been sought only retrospectively, but added: ‘When I get it they will regret that they have confused matters.’ Seven luxury houses forming a crescent called Kingswood Warren Park were sold by development firm Octagon. Objection: Janine Connick, pictured, is a local president who objects to the plan to erect a stockade around the houses . All were five-bedroom ‘mini palaces’ bedecked with marble and high-quality fittings. Octagon was asked to sign a confidentiality agreement when the new cash buyers stepped in. Although the homes were officially sold to a Cayman Islands-registered firm, Symphony Ltd, it is believed Symphony was acting on behalf of four members of a Middle East royal family. So why might fabulously rich Arabs, whose normal playgrounds are multi-million pound homes in London, wish to set up camp in an already well-established community in Surrey? The answer might be that it’s the perfect place from which to visit the Derby once a year at nearby Epsom. Included in the sale at the 11th hour was a road the new owners want to seal off, effectively turning the site into a Middle East-style compound. None of this was in the minds of three couples who paid £10,000 each to reserve three of the four homes in question. Just before contracts were to be exchanged, they were told all four had been sold. Octagon chief executive Colin Tutt refused to discuss the purchase. But one ‘gazumpee’ said: ‘It all stank a little bit – that somebody pitches up with a bag of cash from the Middle East and it becomes a confidential thing, and everybody sucks up to them. It’s not cricket.’ Janine Connick, secretary of adjoining Hamilton Place residents’ association, said: ‘We fear this is actually the start of something rather worrying.’","Six houses in exclusive Kingswood Warren, Surrey bought up by mystery buyers - gazumping prospective owners .

"By . Paul Harris . Hundreds of migrants waiting to be kicked out of Calais have had their deadline for leaving extended. Authorities accepted an argument by charities looking after them in an emergency compound that it would be ‘inhuman’ to force them out when they have nowhere else to go. The midday cut-off was shifted to allow a further 48 hours for organising departure. It is thought the decision was made after it became clear that most of the several hundred would-be asylum seekers in the town would simply find shelter a short walk away – and would continue their daily bids to smuggle themselves into Britain.

Desperate: Migrants push against a steel barrier as their camp in Calais disappears before their eyes . The French . port has for years been a magnet for people from the Middle East and . Africa in search of a new life. Up to 1,000 were displaced on Wednesday . when three squalid campsites that have blighted the town for months were . bulldozed. Yesterday . a worker at the Salam organisation acting for migrants in Calais, said . officials ‘can’t just tell them to go and squat somewhere’, adding: . ‘That’s not a solution. Hopefully we will find one over the weekend.’ Earlier, the looming deadline to evacuate the camps prompted a last minute rush to cross the Channel. Groups wandered around the ferry port, trying to smuggle themselves on lorries. Those who succeed will take the first opportunity to leap out in England – as evidenced by migrants covered in flour after climbing out of a food tanker on the M25. In France, we watched as police pulled three Syrians from the back of a truck – and simply let them go. One of the trio laughed as he told me he would ‘try, try and try again’. Groups were said to be arming themselves with sticks and rocks to re-populate the ‘Jungle’ area outside Calais, a camp cleared by police five years ago after months of lawlessness that saw a British journalist raped. Local authorities have imposed a 'high noon' deadline to clear the port after bulldozing three illegal camps . Police moved onto the sites to remove migrants who are occupying camps, allegedly due to concerns over scabies . Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart argues that Britain's 'generous welfare system' is behind the migrant crisis which sees immigrants, pictured above, trying to cross the Channel to start a new life . Riot police are tonight on standby in anticipation of protests by migrants and activists over the 'high noon' deadline . The crackdown is designed to rid Calais of the blight caused by up to 1,000 migrants, forced from their squalid camps on Wednesday. Charities fed hundreds overnight in an open air compound, but it will close today. One Afghan – his feet crunching eggshell . fragments from the previous night’s meal – told me he was forced to risk . his life to get to Britain.

Migrants looked on as their homes near the ferry port in Calais were . crushed by diggers and cleared into skips . Authorities cracked down on the blight which has been caused by up to 1,000 migrants living in squalor . The 19-year-old added: ‘I have no home. I have no money. I have no choice.’ In seven hours in Calais, photographer Roland Hoskins and I repeatedly witnessed individuals or groups scouring the port for a security glitch that might win them passage to Britain. Every lorry was scrutinised; even families in UK cars were reportedly pestered for a lift. Police blocked a road to the Jungle, warning: ‘They’re picking up stones to throw. You don’t want to be there right now.’ Face off: A migrant confronts a row of grim-faced French riot officers in body armour as his possessions are cleared . The bulldozing of the migrant camp has left many refugees unsure of where to head next - though many are trying to escape to the UK . Groups sat and waited for a window of opportunity to try and jump on a departing lorry to start a new life in the UK - but border guards were on high alert . Officers watch as the camps are cleared, after years of tolerance and human rights wrangles . Nearby, seven young men from Ethiopia and Eritrea said they had been repeatedly beaten by police, who used pepper-spray. Hussein Sultan, 23, a former hospital nurse from Oromia, Ethiopia, said gendarmes bundled him into a car, drove him 30 miles out of Calais and dumped him by the roadside. He took two days to walk back. Yesterday he and six friends were headed for the Jungle. All agreed they would ‘never give up’. Time to move: A gendarme peers into one of the makeshift shelters used by migrants in the Calais camp . Border guards reported dozens hiding in shrubs along roads, often attempting to cling to lorries, after the camp was bulldozed . Groups were said to be arming themselves with sticks and rocks to re-populate the 'Jungle' area outside Calais, a camp cleared by police five years ago . In drizzling rain, hundreds made their way to the ‘feeding station’ compound to get what might be a last supper. Denis Robin, prefect for the Pas de Calais, said migrants must leave the compound today. He said scabies and ‘deplorable hygiene’ had forced the destruction of camps. Border guards reported dozens hiding in shrubs along roads, often attempting to cling to lorries. They regularly risk death. A Sudanese migrant died last week after trying to hide under the axle of a British coach in a car park. Once in the UK they may claim asylum, and so generous benefits; or they may simply disappear into the black economy. Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart has long argued Britain’s ‘generous welfare system’ is behind the migrant crisis in her town. Referring to international treaties governing the treatment of migrants, Miss Bouchart said: ‘Calais is a hostage to the British. That’s enough. It’s no longer tenable.’","Local prefecture in Calais had ordered migrants to leave the town by Friday .

"By . Paul Harris . Even as a very young boy in war-torn Afghanistan, Tamim Sayed harboured a fanciful dream. Every Friday he would go to a makeshift cinema and watch whatever film was available – usually a Bollywood movie or a grainy old classic. And as he sat there enthralled in front of the screen, he determined that one day he would be a movie star. Yesterday that dream came one stage nearer fulfilment. Afghan orphan Tamim Sayed who fled his home country after his parents were murdered by the Taliban has won a place at the National Youth Theatre, London . Tamim – who fled to Britain after his mother and father were kidnapped and murdered by the Taliban – was awarded a prestigious scholarship to the same drama school that moulded the likes of Dame Helen Mirren, Daniel Craig, Sir Ben Kingsley and Daniel Day-Lewis. He was chosen from thousands of hopefuls for a place at the National Youth Theatre, even though when he arrived in Britain eight years ago he spoke barely a word of English. The 16-year-old GCSE pupil is now about to embark on auditions for films and West End plays – or, as he preferred to describe it: ‘Walking in the footsteps of Hollywood superstars.’ When he found out he had won the scholarship, he said, ‘I just started shouting and jumping around the room. He was chosen from thousands of hopefuls for a place at the National Youth Theatre, even though when he arrived in Britain eight years ago he spoke barely a word of English . ‘I never thought someone like me would get into a place like that. It’s mad.’ The remarkable story of the orphan boy from a far-off land and his acting dream could easily have come from a plot for the kind of movie in which he now aspires to star. Back home in Jalalabad, his  cinema visits fuelled his  ambition. ‘That’s where the  acting bug started for me,’ he explained. His father was a high-ranking officer in the Afghan National Army, which marked out the whole family as targets for the Taliban rebels. In 2006 his mother and father were abducted and killed while Tamim, then an eight-year-old, was in school. He was hidden by one of his uncles for a month before he managed to flee to England to live with a cousin and his family in the East End of London. Compared with his lifestyle in Jalalabad, Tamim said, ‘it was a completely different world’. He immediately started to learn English but struggled to adapt to the culture. The foundation for his success was George Mitchell School in Leyton – which has the motto More Is In Me. Tamim – who fled to Britain after his mother and father were kidnapped and murdered by the Taliban – was awarded a prestigious scholarship to the same drama school that moulded the likes of Dame Helen Mirren (right) and Daniel Craig (left) Teachers encouraged him to study hard in order to pursue his acting ambitions. Despite the lifestyle differences, Tamim quickly made a shrewd assessment of the contrasts – a key, perhaps, to his admirable drive and endeavour. ‘It’s weird because I have found it hard to mix in with Western culture,’ he said. ‘Because we do not have much technology at home in Afghanistan, kids would be out playing all the time. ‘Here, everyone just stays in and plays on computers.’ Tamim won a place at the NYT summer camp, an induction for the course, by impressing the assessors during a series of auditions with monologues from John McKay’s off-beat comedy Dead Dad Dog. At first the modest teenager was reluctant to apply for the scholarship but was spurred on by his school drama teacher Annabel Rook. The foundation for his success was George Mitchell School in Leyton ¿ which has the motto More Is In Me. Tamim (centre) with his drama teacher Annabel Rook (right) and school Head Teacher Saeed Hussain (left) ‘A lot of our kids come from tough backgrounds and often don’t have the confidence to go after things like this,’ said Miss Rook, 28. ‘But once you help them believe in themselves, the transformation is incredible.’ Tamim confessed he was ‘very daunted’ by the prospect of trying for the scholarship against such fierce opposition. ‘Because I’m Asian and from Afghanistan, I was worried; you don’t see that many Asian Hollywood stars,’ he said. ‘I have faced racism outside the school in the past so I was worried about that too. ‘But Annabel was with me the whole way, helping with my monologue and telling me that I was good enough to do it.’ Tamim, who likes action movies and lists Gladiator as his favourite, will spend eight years with the National Youth Theatre. Naturally, he hopes one day to appear in a Hollywood blockbuster opposite some of his acting heroes and heroines. His favourite stars include Russell Crowe, Megan Fox and Natalie Portman. Step one on that path to fame, however, is still to be taken. Tomorrow, Tamim sits his drama GCSE exam.","Tamim Sayed fled to Britain after his mother and father were murdered .

"By . Paul Harris . The roast potatoes are crisping up nicely; the turkey is turning a perfect shade of brown. All the trimmings are ready to serve and even the kids are looking forward to the sprouts. Don’t fancy a traditional Christmas dinner this year? Let them eat cake! That’s what everything on this festive plate is made from, right down to the pigs-in-blankets and those mouth-watering baby carrots. Feast: This family start to dig in to a Christmas dinner which is made solely from cake, provided by cakes4funshop.co.uk . The turkey may look real, but it’s actually a multi-layer sponge. The sprouts are little chocolate cakes in disguise; the cranberries are made from sugar paste. And if you’re still hungry after that, you can eat the plate. It’s the brainchild of cake designer Carolyn White, who swapped a grown-up job in advertising 12 years ago to start a business aimed at putting the fun back into baking. Her alternative Christmas offering took more than 40 hours to create, not counting the days of brain-racking that went into perfecting a feast that’s not quite what it seems. A three-strong team led by Lydia Patrice at Carolyn’s London-based firm Cakes 4 Fun crafted it using familiar ingredients such as marzipan, sponge, jam and chocolate. ‘It’s one of the more unusual things we’ve created,’ says Carolyn, who also runs a cake school that teaches up to 5,000 pupils a year. ‘We’ve made all sorts of food — sushi, a cheeseboard, burgers — as well as sexy cakes you wouldn’t want to describe in a family newspaper. ‘It’s a bit of fun and we hope it will encourage more people to became interested in making cakes.’ Madagascan vanilla sponge, . constructed like a giant, oblong sandwich with alternate layers of . sponge, vanilla butter cream and raspberry preserve.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . and Paul Harris . His union paymasters want him to move to the Left. And when it came to this group selfie, it seems Ed Miliband took their wishes too much to heart. In fact, his extreme shift in position meant he almost missed out on appearing in the picture snapped by reality TV star Joey Essex when he found himself surrounded by luvvies and Labour MPs at a party fundraiser. As they scrambled to get in the frame, the Labour leader was shovelled to the rear left of the group and ended up looking like a photobomber trying to muscle in on the act. Among those more prominent in the huddle were actress Emma Thompson, artist Grayson Perry and writer Kathy Lette. Bizarre: Joey Essex last night posted this selfie including Ed Miliband, Grayson Perry and Chuka Umunna . Labour frontbenchers Chuka Umunna, Liz . Kendall and Gloria De Piero also made it, although one high-profile . colleague missed out – the figure hidden by TOWIE star Essex’s quiff was . reportedly deputy leader Harriet Harman. Essex took a second picture of . himself with Mr Miliband and posted it on Twitter with the group shot, . labelled ‘My selfie buddies’. In December, he took a selfie with the . Labour leader at the British Military Awards and refers to the would-be . prime minister as his ‘bezzie’, slang for best friend. The . 23-year-old, who tweets about vitally important matters such as having a . bad hair day, has 2.58million followers on Twitter. Mr Miliband, who . tweets about Royal Mail privatisation and the bedroom tax, has 302,000. The group has all the elements - if not the glamour - of the Oscar's selfie which featured stars including Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey and Julia Roberts. Essex took the snap at an event to raise money for Mr Miliband's general election war chest. He wrote on Twitter: 'At #TeamLabour drinks reception tonight with my selfie buddies Emma Thompson and @Ed_Miliband & gang pic.' He later tweeted a selfie of himself and Mr Miliband, writing: 'With me and my bezzie Ed Miliband.' Joey Essex described Ed Miliband as his 'bezzie' friend in a later selfie between the two of them . The Labour party is recruiting a senior adviser to bring ‘fresh ideas’ to overhauling the leader’s image. As Britain's biggest selling broadsheet left-wing newspaper, Ed Miliband understandably wants to keep the Guardian on side. Today he is visited the paper's north London HQ, to address their morning conference meeting. But staff will have tried to keep today's edition of its G2 supplement from him, headlined: 'Can you make this guy less weird?' In . addition to having ideas about how to improve Mr Miliband’s ‘brand . strengths’, the successful candidate will also need to have experience . of dealing with ‘bad news stories’. But someone obviously thinks that joining the selfie craze is the right way to reverse polls which show four in 10 voters think Mr Miliband is 'weird'. While Labour has maintained a lead in the polls, Mr Miliband’s personal ratings have remained poor. A YouGov survey last week showed 41 per cent of people think the Labour leader is ‘weird’ or ‘very weird’. The . survey for BuzzFeed, which looked at the public’s perception of the . leaders’ personalities, also found 36 per cent of the population believe . Mr Miliband would have been bullied at school. With . some opinion polls putting Labour’s lead over the Tories at just one . point, Mr Miliband has ordered his team to beef up his media operation. The . Labour website is advertising the new role of Head of the Leader’s . Broadcasting, to be based in the Leader of the Opposition’s Office. The . new job comes with a £44,244.40 salary, and a ‘fixed sum allowance’ of . £971. The contract will last only until a month after the general . election, due in May 2015. This week Prince Andrew became the latest prominent public figure to take a spontaneous self-portrait who tweeted a photograph of himself during an event at St James’s Palace.

"By . Paul Harris . She was 16-years-old and desperate to serve king and country. Dorothy Bell already had a brother in the RAF and every day there were reports of the war in Europe, feats of great heroism abroad and news of friends signing up for service. So she told the authorities she was 19 and wangled herself into the Women’s Auxiliary Territorial Service, handling secret messages and transporting some of the most senior officers. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . White lie: Dorothy Bell was 16 when she said she was 19 to join the Women's Auxiliary Territorial Service . Secrets: She handled top secret messages during the Battle of Bulge in The Ardennes in 1944 and 1945 . Had she not done so she would probably have missed the war. But . that little white lie she told in 1942 will resurface today – when she . is awarded France’s highest honour in recognition of her service. Lance .

"By . Paul Harris . Dawn had just broken over the squalid, stinking campsite that had been the young Afghan’s home by the dockside in Calais for the last three months. When 20-year-old Morad Mohammed looked out of his makeshift tent there was a French policeman in riot gear telling him to get up and go. ‘Where?’ he asked the officer as he watched the site being dismantled and destroyed all around him. ‘Go to UK,’ the policeman told him. ‘It’s easy.’ Desperate: Migrants push against a steel barrier as their camp in Calais disappears before their eyes. Not one said the action would alter their hopes of getting to Britain to start a new life . That was how the French authorities yesterday thought they could solve the long-standing problem of migrants using the port as a waiting room for a new life in Britain. But today – within hours of the campsite being cleared – the daily struggle by refugees and chancers trying to smuggle themselves aboard a lorry or cling to a cross-Channel train was set to start again. Yet, even in the long and difficult history of Calais as a stepping stone towards the white cliffs of Dover, yesterday was dramatically different. Everywhere the would-be Britons looked when they emerged into the daylight, they saw police vans, gendarmes and officers in full riot gear. Somewhere in the distance, a brace of bulldozers was waiting to move in and flatten everything to the ground. And so, in a carefully planned operation to rid the French port of this eyesore and its unwanted controversy and in a fierce confrontation with those demanding human rights for the migrants, another chapter in a years-old saga came to a close. If only it was the finale. But even as mechanical diggers were crushing tents and turning three campsites back into swathes of empty wasteland, anyone you spoke to would tell you it won’t end here. ‘Not until I get to England or die trying,’ as one put it yesterday. Nor is it likely to halt an immigration merry-go-round which arrest, deportation, beatings and appalling conditions have repeatedly failed  to stop. One charity worker said Calais ‘will always be a magnet of hope’ for the thousands who see it as the last stop before Britain. Face off: A migrant confronts a row of grim-faced French riot officers in body armour as his possessions are cleared . Last night that determination was underlined by little clutches of people, cold and homeless, but far from hopeless, wandering the streets, sitting in doorways, sleeping under bushes – and waiting for the next chance to try. It took months to turn this camp into somewhere that up to 1,000 migrants colonised; less than two hours to destroy it. Authorities insisted it had to be cleared because of an outbreak of scabies, a skin condition caused by mites (although none of the migrants I spoke to yesterday knew anyone who had been infected). Scuffles broke out as armed police used shields and batons to corral and drive back scores of migrants whose base was being flattened before their eyes, often with their possessions still inside their tents. A few hundred yards away, a P&O ferry was loading lorries and other vehicles before setting sail for England. Everyone knew there would be another one soon. Time to move: A gendarme peers into one of the makeshift shelters used by migrants in the Calais camp . Yasir Muhammad, a 25-year-old student, sat on a grass bank with some companions as the diggers moved in. He told me he was kidnapped by Taliban supporters from his home in Peshawar, had a hood put over his head and was threatened with his life. He abandoned his dream of studying to become a zoologist and fled. He and his family paid 10,000 US dollars to a fixer to get him to Iran, then through Turkey, Greece, Italy and France. He has been in Calais for the past four months, despite being deported twice to Italy, the country that holds his fingerprints. Each time he has returned; next stop London. ‘I will get there,’ he tells me, pointing out to sea with the only remnant of his former home – a glass-fibre tent pole. In a daily routine that spans morning, noon and night, he calculates he has tried more than 400 times to get to Britain. With a smile, he adds: ‘One day, I know that I will succeed.’ Nearby young Morad (his name means ‘Wish’) was describing the ‘very frightening’ moment he was woken and beaten by a police officer ordering him to get out of his tent. The student, who says his family was murdered, left the camp with nothing but his clothes when the police moved in. Levelled: A digger ploughs into shelters, crushing them and the possessions occupants couldn't save . Another Afghan, probably in his 30s, complained: ‘No one explained what was happening. We were just told to move. Now we have nowhere to stay, nowhere to sleep. We have lost everything. ‘But we still have our human rights. Here, they give you nothing. In Britain, they give you a house, somewhere to sleep. That is where  I will go.’ Yesterday charity and support groups – as well as activists demanding fair treatment for the migrants – brought food and water and handed out numbered tickets to exchange for blankets. About 300 were moved to an open-air compound for the night as volunteers prepared meals for them. One stood talking in French among a group of maybe 100 displaced ex-campsite dwellers and told me: ‘They are prepared to risk their lives to get to England and they’re not going to give up. ‘They don’t want to stay in France. They cannot go home. So yes, they will be back. If not here, then somewhere else in Calais. ‘It is a cycle, a continuing cycle. It is their gateway to the UK. The authorities? They can close the gate, but people will still find a way.’","French police cleared migrant camps at the Channel port yesterday .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . and Paul Harris . The companions she grew up with included a lion, a chimp and a polar bear. June Williams had a doll and a cuddly teddy, of course, but you'd be more likely to find her snuggling up to a penguin. Nor would it have been unusual to spot her  posing for photographs with her head in a pelican's bill, or maybe sitting on an elephant's knee. And while other children might have been content to play hop-scotch or skipping games, June  preferred dancing with goats. Unlikely friendship: As a young girl, June Williams counted lions, chimpanzees and polar bears among her best friends. Above, the youngster plays with two lion cubs . Play time: These amazing images show the unlikely friendships she formed growing up at Britain's biggest zoo. Above, Ms Williams plays with a chimpanzee and a doll . Dancing with a goat: Ms Williams was just four years old when her father, George Mottershead, bought Oakfield House in Chester, which later became Chester Zoo . Family: She moved into the property on December 7, 1930, after her father (right) bought the land for just £3,500. Left, Ms Williams is pictured reading to a chimpanzee . Home: Now aged 87, Ms Williams (pictured in front of Oakfield House) has spoken out about her 'interesting' and 'exiciting' upbringing ahead of a new BBC drama . It sounds like a fantasy world created . by a little girl who adored animals. But June grew up with them all as . her father founded and built up what is now the UK's biggest zoo. And . — at the age of 87 — June has thrown open a treasured album of . black-and-white photos to reveal her delightful relationship with her . family of animal friends. Her story is part of a BBC1 drama,  Our Zoo, . charting the founding of Chester Zoo by its eccentric owner George . Mottershead, June's father. Yesterday . in advance of the launch of the mini-series, June recalled: 'It was . very exciting growing up surrounded by all these animals and it was an . amazing feeling having them as friends — I never thought my childhood . was unusual. 'I would always . try to help out by working in the shop, locking up gates and then, on . days when staff were off, I'd help out a bit more with the animals. I . loved every minute of it.' Looking cheery: In 1930, the Mottershead family owned only one gibbon and two goats - but more than 80 years on, the zoo now boasts an enormous collection of animals . Food time: The black-and-white photos show Ms Williams playing with lions, feeding pelicans (pictured), reading to monkeys and dancing with goats during her childhood . Mucking in: She can even be seen poking her fingers through a cage to feed a Canadian black bear (right) and bending down to feed penguins, Charlie and Sadie (left) Ex-serviceman . George paid £3,500 for a small area of land around Oakfield House in . Chester in 1930 and moved into the house with his wife Lucy, daughter . June, then aged four, and her sister Muriel. The . only animals the family had were two goats, later joined by a gibbon. The first  animals acquired specifically for the zoo were two bears from . a wildlife park in Matlock, Derbyshire. Neighbours . worried that the animals would escape, but Mr Mottershead continued to . stock it with exotic and sometimes dangerous beasts, including lions. Furry helper: Ms Williams's father, George Mottershead, is pictured with a chimpanzee called Mary, which helped him build a lion enclosure when the zoo was first set up . Getting to work: Ms Williams said it was 'an amazing feeling' counting animals among her friends. Above, Mr Mottershead and Mary the chimp work on the enclosure . Relatives: 'It was very exciting growing up as a young girl surrounded by these animals,' said the pensioner. Left, Mr Mottershead and, right, Ms Williams's sister, Muriel . Yet . June's fondest memory is of her bond with a lion cub, Christy, which . she hand-reared after its mother died giving birth to another cub. Her . greatest disappointment was to learn that her father swapped Christy for . a polar bear and had the lion shipped to France without telling her. June married and moved to Australia in 1954, but returned later to work at the zoo. Now . a widow, she lives a stone's throw from the grounds of the zoo, which . boats 11,000 animals from 400 species. 'It's reassuring to live so . close,' she said. 'I had some great times there.' Educational: 'Obviously the war happened not too long after and that halted progress,' she added. Above, a photo showing a nine-year-old June reading to a chimpanzee . Befriending the animals: Ms Williams is pictured as a nine-year-old girl with her head in Pelly the pelican's beak (left) and holding on to a Macaw called Robbie (right) Ms Williams, whose husband, Fred, died in 2012, said she wasn't aware her childhood was unusual at the time - and only realised how lucky she had been to grow up at the zoo years later. 'I was only four and a half when my father bought the zoo,' she said. 'There was a bad reaction to it at first because people were frightened of the noise and whether the wild animals might get out. 'In those days, Upton had lots of large houses and businessmen living there and they didn't want something like this coming in and taking over. Motherly duties: During her time at the zoo, Ms Williams hand reared her own lion cub, Christy, after its mother died giving birth. Above, June, 19, is pictured with Christy . Growing up together: Ms Williams, whose husband, Fred, died in 2012, said she wasn't aware her childhood was unusual at the time. Above, she is pictured with Mary . Dancing through life: The pensioner spent her . childhood and early twenties helping at the zoo, before leaving to work . in Australia and New Zealand during the 1950s . 'I never thought my childhood was . unusual as it's just your parents and your home - you grow up all the . same and don't know any different.' The pensioner spent her childhood and early twenties helping at the zoo, before leaving to work in Australia and New Zealand during the 1950s. She even hand reared her own lion cub, Christy, after its mother died giving birth to another cub - but the pair were later torn apart when her father sold the lion to a French buyer in return for a polar bear. 'As a child, I would always try to help out by working in the shop, locking up gates and then on days when staff were off, I would help out a bit more with the animals,' said Ms Williams. Commemorative plaque: 'As a child, I would always try to help out by working in the shop,' said Ms Williams. Above, a plaque in memory of her father, George Mottershead . Family business: Ms Williams's grandfather, Albert (left), had a key role in the opening of Chester Zoo, while her father, George (right), was the facility's official founder . 'When I was much older, I was in charge of the aquarium, a job I did for quite a few years. It was incredibly disappointing to lose Christy, but such is life. 'My husband and I moved away in 1954 to live in Australia and New Zealand just so we could see a bit of the world. We did quite a few jobs out there but the highlight for me was working as a waitress on the Great Barrier Reef. 'My . husband mainly worked as a handyman and because we had a caravan we . could travel around the country and see some of the sights.' After . travelling to the other side of the world, Ms Williams and her husband . returned to work at the zoo, where there had been several new additions. Still smiling: Since 2012, Ms Williams (pictured in front of a portrait of her father) has lived alone in Oakfield Drive, just a stone's throw away from the zoo's grounds . 'We were out in Australia and New Zealand for about three years and when we returned to the UK there were a fair few noticeable changes at the zoo,' she said. 'I went back to working in the aquarium and Fred helped out with a lot of the planning for building work as the zoo really started to expand. 'I don't remember when exactly it was but myself and Fred moved to Rhosneigr on Anglesey after we retired and by that point the zoo had grown ever so much. 'At the beginning we only had a few animals but by then there were at least two or three of every animal and the amount of land we had was incredible. 'It was a very interesting childhood and I loved every minute of it. I have got some incredible memories.' Since her husband's death in 2012, Ms Williams has lived alone in Oakfield Drive, situated just a stone's throw away from the zoo's grounds. 'It is very reassuring to live so close to where I spent most of my childhood because I have had some great times there,' she said. 'I think the new TV show will be very exciting and I hope people can enjoy seeing how the zoo became what it is today.' The TV series, Our Zoo, featuring Inspector George Gently star Lee Ingleby and Life on Mars actress Liz White, will be screened on BBC1.","June Williams, 87, was just four years old when her father, George Mottershead, opened Chester Zoo in Cheshire .

"By . Paul Harris . In the course of nearly half a century it has become one of the most familiar sounds  on radio. But old age has finally caught up with the whistle that calls time on contestants in BBC Radio 4’s Just a Minute. The ‘pea’ which has provided the shrill for 826 episodes of the award-winning panel game is so ancient, it has made the whistle unreliable. Louder: The new Acme Thunderer whistle, left, the same kind used by football referees, and the original . That raises the almost unthinkable prospect that panellists could be left blathering on for critical seconds, even after successfully completing the challenge to speak for a minute on specially chosen subjects ‘without repetition, hesitation or deviation’. But yesterday a BBC whistleblower revealed to the Daily Mail that help is at hand. Production assistant Trudi Stevens, currently in charge of blowing the whistle at the end of each minute, confirms she has been given a new one – an Acme Thunderer of the kind used by referees. It’s so loud she fears the consequences when she blows it for the first time beside veteran presenter Nicholas Parsons, who will be 91 this year. 'I don’t want to startle him,’ she said. ‘The other week I did manage to blow the old whistle really well and it made him jump out of his seat.’ 'I don't want to startle Nicholas': The new whistle so loud whistleblower Trudi Stevens fears the consequences when she blows it for the first time beside veteran presenter Nicholas Parsons, who will be 91 this year . Trudi was recruited as a whistleblower in 2007, and has probably blown it around 500 of the estimated 8,000 times it has been heard since Mr Parsons chaired the first episode in 1967. ‘He tells listeners that whistleblowers need big breaths,’ says Trudi. ‘However people who follow the show tell me I have “a unique style” – which mainly means I don’t blow it hard enough.’ Yesterday, Mr Parsons declared he was delighted a replacement had been found, adding: ‘The whistle was very antiquated – I think they got it out of an old trunk somewhere, and it was somewhat unreliable. 'I hope listeners will look forward to hearing the new one.’","Old age has finally caught up with the whistle that's kept time since 1967 .

"By . Paul Harris . Deadly waste washed up on Britain’s beaches is killing  dogs or leaving them writhing in agony. At least three pets have died and dozens more have been poisoned after swallowing solidified palm oil believed to have been dumped at sea. The waxy white substance, possibly contaminated with cleaning fluid or diesel oil, has been found on beaches along virtually the entire UK coast. Toxic: Zanzi died after eating a tiny amount of rancid palm oil washed up on the beach at Marazion, Cornwall . At one stage a single veterinary practice in Cornwall was treating cases at the rate of one or two a day for three weeks. Now maritime, environment and animal welfare organisations are warning dog owners to steer clear of the toxic substance and report any findings. The extent of the pollution came to light after the Daily Mail pieced together a string of separate cases dating back to October. Severe storms are thought to have driven the waste ashore. Although palm oil is extensively used in food products, it can be fatal to dogs in solid form and owners without pet insurance are being left with huge bills for emergency veterinary treatment. The latest victim was 23-month-old lurcher-Staffordshire terrier cross Dave, who died after a walk with owner Fiona Crook on Mothecombe beach in Devon, near her home on the outskirts of Plymouth. Lethal: The waxy white substance being found on the entire UK coast is thought to come from cleaning fluid . Mrs Crook said he became violently sick hours after playing with a large white chunk of a lard-like substance. She took the dog to a vet, who referred him to a specialist in Wellington, Somerset. ‘His kidneys and liver were horribly damaged,’ she told the Mail. ‘The specialists did everything they could for him but he didn’t make it.’ Mrs Crook and her husband Stephen, a plumbing and heating engineer, said losing Dave was ‘really difficult’ for them and daughters Lucy, 13, and Kerry, six. Lucy Garrett Peel saw Zanzi, her three-year-old miniature schnauzer, suffer an agonising death after  swallowing a marble-size ball of solidified oil from the beach at Marazion, south Cornwall. Tragic: 23-month-old Dave, a lurcher-Staffordshire terrier cross, died after a walk in Devon with his owner . Mrs Garrett Peel, the National Trust’s handbook editor, was walking with 14-year-old daughter Cicely when she noticed Zanzi chewing something. She said: ‘She started being sick about 15 minutes later. ‘We immediately took her to the vet and she had an emergency operation. She died that night. Whatever it was got stuck in her stomach. It was tested and found to be extremely rancid palm oil, containing some very nasty bacteria.’ Laura Kleckham’s collie-border cross Poppy died after eating some oil on a beach at Portwrinkle, south-east Cornwall. Other poisoning cases have been reported in Brighton, Shoreham and Worthing. The RSPCA said it was investigating and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said it was monitoring the situation.","Waxy white substance across UK coast suspected to be cleaning fluid .

"By . Paul Harris . They are treasures that shed light on one of the greatest love stories of the 20th century. From fabulous jewels to deeply personal gifts, the precious objects which once belonged to the Duke and Duchess of Windsor give a rare insight into the life of a king – and the woman for whom he sacrificed the throne. Yesterday, as they were sold for £620,125 at auction, they also served to underline some of the torment the couple endured during a romance that scandalised the monarchy and threatened the constitution. Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson's relationship shocked the nation, as Mrs Simpson was a divorcee, prompting the Queen's uncle to abdicate his throne in order to marry his sweetheart . Edward VIII’s affair with American divorcee Wallis Simpson shocked the nation and forced him to abdicate in 1936 to marry his sweetheart. The couple famously chronicled their partnership with a succession of diamonds and gifts made out of precious stones, many inscribed with heartfelt messages relating to special moments the couple shared together. Most of those items were sold 26 years ago in a spectacular auction that attracted widespread interest from celebrities, royalty and wealthy collectors around the world. Yesterday Sotheby’s auctioned off another set of jewels, in a sale it said would celebrate the stylish couple’s ‘exquisite taste’ and position them against a backdrop of four generations of British monarchs. The treasures of Edward and Mrs Simpson went under the hammer at Sotheby's selling for £620,125 . Perhaps the most poignant item was a fob watch that marked the lovers’ enforced separation during the time that they were waiting for her divorce to come through, before they were finally able to marry in 1937. Wallis gave it to ‘David’, the family name for Edward, at Easter that year. On one side of the dial she wrote her name; on the other, the name of the lover who – in time – she would finally be allowed to call her husband. Also sold yesterday was a magnificently extravagant Cartier sapphire bracelet, which Wallis wore when the Queen dropped by to visit the couple at the house they shared in the Bois de Boulogne near Paris. She called there with the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles during a state visit to France in 1972. Edward – battling cancer – died ten days later. Sotheby’s jewellery division chairman David Bennett said there was a ‘continuing fascination’ for jewellery and precious objects associated with the couple, particularly items that gave insights into their life together. During their famous love affair, Wallis Simpson and the Duke of Windsor exchanged beautiful diamonds and poignant gifts, many inscribed with heartfelt messages . Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson on their wedding day in 1937 . Few could have imagined, as the 20th century dawned, that an American socialite would prove the cause of the biggest constitutional crisis the Royal Family - and the UK - has ever faced.But Wallis Simpson was no ordinary socialite and her future husband Edward VIII, no ordinary king.The pair met in January 1934 and twice-divorced Simpson and the then Prince of Wales swiftly fell in love.At first the relationship raised few concerns, Edward was notorious for his affairs with society ladies, but that all changed when George V died on the 20th January 1936.When, the next day, the new King-Emperor chose to watch the proclamation of his accession in the company of Simpson, it became clear that he intended to marry her.This precipitated a crisis, firstly because the political establishment considered a twice-divorced woman an unsuitable consort, and secondly, because Edward was now head of the Church of England, which at the time, did not allow marriages between divorcees.Edward suggested a morganatic marriage which would have prevented Simpson becoming Queen Consort, but the prime ministers of the UK, Australia and South Africa rejected the plan.By early December, the true nature of Simpson's relationship with the King had become public knowledge and she fled the country.Despite attempts by Simpson to get him to reconsider, on the 13th December 1936, Edward abdicated and was succeeded by his brother, George VII.The couple eventually married, a month after Wallis' second divorce was granted, on the 3rd June 1937 in the south of France.Although Edward had been created the Duke of Windsor by his brother and was entitled to the style 'His Royal Highness', his wife was refused the honour and was styled instead as 'Her Grace.'","Treasures shedding light on one of the greatest love stories of the 20th century sell for £620,125 at auction .

"By . Paul Harris . and Anna Hodgekiss . He has hugged an elephant, rubbed shoulders with celebrities and fulfilled a bizarre dream to go crowd-surfing in a rubber dinghy. There’s not much Stephen Sutton didn’t get round to on his 46-point ‘bucket list’, right down to having a tattoo and learning to juggle. But yesterday the cancer-stricken teenager chalked up one achievement he never anticipated when he set himself a series of challenges after he realised he didn’t have long to live. Scroll down for videos . The Teenage Cancer Trust tweeted 'You Did It' celebrating Stephen's Just Giving page reaching the £1million mark . Joy: Upon hearing the news, Stephen tweeted his thanks - and amazement - to all involved . Stephen's efforts were helped considerably by the comedien and TV presenter Jason Manford, who has  started the Twitter trend #thumbsupforStephen . Mr Sutton's story captured the hearts of the nation when he declared he wanted to tick off a particular part of his bucket list - raising £1m for charity to 'prove there has been some purpose to my short life' The 19-year-old former schoolboy athlete raised £1million for charity – and saw himself become an internet sensation as he clung to life in a hospital bed. With a broad smile and ‘a final thumbs-up’ sign posted on his web page diary, he thanked everyone who helped him raise the money and declared: ‘Wow. Just wow.’ Stephen, who was diagnosed with bowel cancer when he was 15, originally hoped to raise £10,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust. It was number one on his ‘to do’ list, which included organising a charity skydive, quizzes, a football match, and playing the drums in front of a huge crowd. But his plight so captured the hearts of those who followed his Facebook, Twitter and internet updates, he all but abandoned the list after crossing off 33 challenges – and used the growing goodwill to keep fundraising. Number 42 was ‘to inspire someone to become a doctor or fundraiser’. ‘Done’ he wrote next to it on his blog, adding: ‘The main thing I want to do is help others.’ The comedian and TV presenter Jason Manford has pledged to help Stephen raise the money. Stephen tweeted that he is 'hanging in here as best I can' A host of celebrities including Alan Davies, Piers Morgan, Clare Balding and Jimmy Carr are supporting Stephen . Stephen (pictured with comedian Jimmy Carr) has been battling cancer since the age of 15. Within six months he underwent a hemicolectomy to remove a tumour from his bowel . Stephen, from Burntwood, . Staffordshire, was healthy and active before he was stricken with . colorectal cancer, competing at county level in athletics and . cross-country running, and playing for Walsall FC’s youth team. His . burning ambition was to become a doctor. He had a tumour removed but the cancer returned and spread. Told . that he was unlikely to survive for more than a few years, in January . last year he started his internet diary, supported by his mother Jane, . 49, brother Christopher, 21, and stepfather Tony. He . gave motivational talks on his illness and recruited the likes of Piers . Morgan, Clare Balding, Robbie Fowler, Alan Davies and Jimmy Carr to his . cause. Plight: Last summer, Mr Sutton gave a speech at Downing Street about his illness . Despite the 'dire' state of his health, Stephen took to Twitter to express his appreciation for the donations . In a tongue-in-cheek swipe at his illness to complete number 23 on his list he had a pair of scissors tattooed on the operational scars that run along his body . He increased the fundraising target when it became clear how much interest he was generating. He wanted ‘to prove there has been some purpose to my short life’. Yesterday . a £10 donation from a well-wisher called Jilly tipped the fund over the . £1million mark with the message: ‘Looks like your wish will come true.’ But Stephen warned his condition was ‘dire’, telling his followers: ‘I think this is just one hurdle too far.’ As donations continued to pour in at around £50 a minute, he declared: ‘That’s it from me’, and thanked everyone. He added two words of advice: ‘Enjoy life.’ To donate to Stephen’s bucket list, visit Justgiving.com/Stephen-sutton-TCT. Bowel cancer, also known as colorectal cancer, is the third most common cancer in the UK, and also one of the most preventable forms of the disease, World Cancer Research Fund says. In 2011, 42,747 cases of bowel cancer were diagnosed. Scientists estimate that about half of all bowel cancer cases in the UK - over 20,000 - could be prevented by maintaining a healthy weight, choosing a healthy diet, not drinking alcohol and being physically active. Many different factors contribute to the development of bowel cancer, with some of the most important factors being every day lifestyle choices such as diet. The WCRF found that lifestyle factors that can increase the risk of developing bowel cancer include being: overweight or obese, lack of physical activity, diets low in fibre, diets high in red and processed meat, drinking alcohol, smoking. Other factors include age, family history of bowel cancer, or personal history of polyps or inflammatory bowel disease.

"By . Paul Harris . and Michael Allen . There’s a reason why two-year-old Daisy Young is cuddling Bunny the rabbit very tightly – and  it’s not just because she loves her more than any other toy. Bunny, Daisy’s constant companion since she was just ten months, vanished from her side on a family shopping trip to the January sales. Daisy’s mother Hayley Sworn only noticed Bunny was missing when they got home. Just how would she break the news to Daisy that the precious gift from her grandma was gone forever? Never let me go: Daisy Young is reunited with Bunny, through the power of social media . In a different age the family might have appealed for help by putting up posters around the shopping centre where Bunny was last seen, or on lamp-posts along the route home near Redhill in Surrey. Instead, the power of 21st century social media - and the efforts of tens of thousands of strangers - got there first to bring Bunny and Daisy back together. Bunny was found in a car park in Croydon and pictures of her were posted on Twitter in an attempt to track down the owner. Inseparable: Daisy and Bunny take a nap . Two weeks later, after notching  up more . than 50,000 views online, Bunny returned unharmed from her adventure, . with a note explaining her absence. ‘We didn’t think we would ever get it back,’ said Miss Sworn, a primary school teacher who is engaged to Daisy’s father Kieron Young, a 35-year-old business analyst. ‘Daisy has a tendency to throw things and we’d obviously missed that she’d thrown it. ‘It’s very treasured and it goes everywhere with her. We just planned to buy her another one.’ Grand day out: Daisy takes Bunny everywhere - they even share a car seat (right) What she didn’t realise was that Bryony Merritt, a press officer at Birkbeck, University of London, was on the case. To the rescue: Bryony Merritt found Bunny and alerted social media . After finding Bunny in the car park, . and noticing Daisy’s name on a tag, she alerted Croydon-related Twitter . accounts to her find. The appeal was eventually forwarded on to Lostbox, a website that uses social media to match lost and found items to owners. One of Miss Sworn’s friends saw a photo of Bunny online, all perky ears and wearing her distinctive floral dress, and sent her the link. The family then got in touch with Miss Merritt, 30, who volunteered to post Bunny home. In a card accompanying the package she wrote: ‘Dear Daisy. Here is your bunny – home safe and sound. We had a lovely time together – walks in the woods, jumping competitions etc. But Bunny missed you and wanted to come home.’ Yesterday Miss Sworn said: ‘I let Daisy open the envelope and she was so thrilled. She said: “I love my Bunny.” ‘I do keep checking every day that we’ve got her. We’re going to be vigilant from now on.’","Daisy Young, two, lost her favourite toy, Bunny, on a shopping trip .

"By . Paul Harris . and John Hall . Typical. You wait two months for a train and then they all come along when the Prime Minister shows up. But yesterday, after a £35million rescue mission and a remarkable feat of emergency engineering, David Cameron and the south west of England gave a collective cheer for the Orange Army that got the railway running through poor old Dawlish again. In an extraordinary spectacle, the Prime Minister and a battalion of hi-viz jacketed rail workers united in the Devon seaside town to celebrate the reopening of a line that was devastated in the February storms. Scroll down for videos . Back on track: The Dawlish railway line reopened this morning after being destroyed in floods earlier in the year. In just two months, the sea wall was significantly strengthened and the track itself completely rebuilt . 'Orange Army': David Cameron praised the uniformed Network Rail engineers that rebuilt the 'vital' service. Describing them as the 'Orange Army', the Prime Minister called on the gathered crowd to give them three cheers . Open for business: On Twitter David Cameron said it was 'great to meet the Orange Army'. Earlier he described the south west as 'a wonderful part of the country' Visiting the reopened railway line this morning, the Prime Minister said: 'This is a great day for the hard-working people of Dawlish, and for businesses and commuters across the South West whose lives have been turned upside down by the devastating loss of their train line' Repair: The track running through Dawlish in Devon was badly damaged by storms in February. The stretch of track (pictured this morning) has finally reopened, with the first trains travelling through the station shortly after 6am . Damage: The track through Dawlish was swept away along with part of the sea wall (pictured) in early February, completely cutting off the mainline railway service for almost two months . Weather: The coast-hugging railway line was closed on February 5 when winter storms that devastated large areas of south west England led to huge waves battering the Dawlish seaboard and destroying the sea wall . Fixed: Thanks to 'heroic' work by a team of engineers - including dramatically reinforcing the sea wall (pictured) - the line has now opened at a total cost of £35million . Arrivals: Visiting the reopened railway line this morning, Prime Minister described the reopening of the Dawlish railway as 'a great day' David . Cameron said 'the impact of the extreme weather shows the importance of . making our railways strong enough to weather any storm' Humour: David Cameron laughs at a T-shirt worn by one of the Network Rail workers. The shirt reads: 'The Orange Army came to the Dawlish rescue' Joy: Town Crier Steve Cunliffe and his wife Caroline celebrate the reopening of the Dawlish railway line during a visit by Prime Minister David Cameron . A . 300-strong Network Rail team toiled night and day in what Mr Cameron . called a ‘Herculean effort’ to restore the track and rebuild the station . after crashing waves left rails suspended in mid-air along part of the . coast-hugging line. In . tones more suited to announcing a general election victory than the . reopening of a railway, he hailed it as ‘a great day’ and called for . three cheers for the Orange Army. And so, yesterday, the first passenger train in 58 days was able to trundle once again along the picturesque route. The . 5.34 from Exeter to Paignton was followed by a succession of trains . that finally allowed the West Country to be reunited with the rest of . the nation by rail. David Cameron declared the south west of England 'open for business' again as he visited the reopened railway line this morning . All aboard: Prime Minister David Cameron rides on one of the first trains to pass through Dawlish after the line was reopened following weeks of repair works . Danger: The track foundations were completely swept away by the waves that burst through the sea wall . Fixing the damage: The track was badly damaged by the winter storms (left). Network Rail's 'Orange Army' (right) worked for two months to rebuild it . Back to normal: David Cameron described the reopening of the Dawlish railway as 'a great day', as the first passenger train on the new line the 5:34am from Exeter to Paignton . An early morning train sweeps through the Devonshire town of Dawlish after the damaged track reopened . The train that carried David Cameron is seen departing Dawlish station in Devon earlier this morning . Ride: Prime Minister David Cameron and Network Rail chiefs rode on a train through the newly reopened stretch of track that hugs the Dawlish coastline. The line was destroyed by floods in February, but reopened today . A smiling David Cameron was greeted by schoolchildren holding 'welcome' banners when he arrived at Dawlish train station this morning . Stop: The Prime Minister said it was 'vital' to have the railway line that travels through Dawlish reopened. He added that south west England was once again 'open for business' Celebration: Sticks of rock (left) celebrating the reopening of the railway line were handed out by Network Rail staff at Dawlish railway station. Prime Minister David Cameron (right) described the workers as 'The Orange Army' Shared: Cameron later took to his Twitter page to share photographs of his visit to Dawlish. He posted an image of himself posing with locals and uniformed railway engineers, with a caption reading: 'Great to meet the 'Orange Army', and mark the re-opening of the vital Dawlish railway line after the storms' The . coast-hugging railway line was destroyed on February 5 when winter . storms that devastated large areas of south west England led to huge . waves battering the Dawlish seaboard. The waters eventually punched a hole in the sea wall, washing away large areas of railway line. In places the track was so badly damaged that it was left standing upright in the air. Visiting the reopened railway line this morning, the Prime Minister . said: 'This is a great day for the hard-working people of Dawlish, and . for businesses and commuters across the South West whose lives have been . turned upside down by the devastating loss of their train line.' 'Back . in February when I visited the town to see the damage for myself, I . promised to do everything I could to get this vital artery back up and . running as quickly as possible. I am delighted to say that promise has . been delivered today,' he added. 'The impact of the extreme . weather shows the importance of making our railways strong enough to . weather any storm,' Mr Cameron went on to say. Later Mr Cameron took to his Twitter page to share photographs of his visit to Dawlish. He posted an image of himself chatting with workmen, with the caption: 'Everyone here is incredibly grateful to all those who worked so hard to get the South West open for business again.' Another showed him posing with uniformed railway engineers, and had a caption reading: 'Great to meet the 'Orange Army', and mark the re-opening of the vital Dawlish railway line after the storms.' Washed away: The first hole in the sea wall appeared on February 5. A second severe storm on the night of February 14 led to another breach, and hampered ongoing repair work . Work to repair the track started . within a week of the initial storm, but was hampered by another severe storm on the night of . February 14 which led to another breach in the sea wall. Then, on March 4 engineers discovered . 25,000 tonnes of a cliff face near Teignmouth just south of Dawlish had . sheared away above the line. It resulted in water jets being used to pummel the cliff face to create a controlled landslide. Contractors created new 11.5 foot deep concrete foundations into the breach in the sea wall before the track was re-laid. In total, £15million was spent repairing the area outside Dawlish station where track had been left dangling, with an an additional £20million spent repairing tracks either side of the town. Andy Crowley, from contractor Amco, . said: 'The amount of concrete that's gone in there, that will be there . for at least 200 years, beyond a shadow of a doubt.' Julian Burnell, from Network Rail, said the repair of the breach was 'very, very solid'. Destroyed: The famous Dawlish railway line was terribly damaged during the dramatic storms in February . Moving forward: Contractors created new 11.5 foot deep concrete foundations into the breach in the sea wall before the track was re-laid . Cost: £15million was spent repairing the area outside Dawlish station, with an an additional £20million spent repairing tracks either side of the town . 'Heroes': Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne said: 'Our army of engineers has done an amazing job of putting back together a railway that was ravaged by the elements' Looking  good: On March 4 engineers discovered 25,000 tonnes of a cliff face near Teignmouth just south of Dawlish had sheared away above the line . Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne said: 'Our army of engineers has done an amazing job of putting back together a railway that was ravaged by the elements. 'They have overcome every obstacle thrown at them, winning many battles along the way to restore this critical piece of the network, ahead of schedule, and in time for the Easter holidays.' He thanked 'hugely supportive and patient' local communities and businesses. Network Rail is now looking at creating a new inland route as a back-up to the Dawlish line. The reopening was welcomed in Cornwall too. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne said the engineers have overcome every obstacle thrown at them, 'winning many battles along the way to restore this critical piece of the network, ahead of schedule' Great timing: The railway line reopened just in time for the Easter holidays when tourists traditionally flock to south west England . Cornwall Council Leader John Pollard said: 'It is excellent news that the rail line has re-opened much earlier than originally predicted and I would like to pay tribute to the hard work of Network Rail in achieving this.' 'Over the past two months everyone has worked together to keep Cornwall connected, with staff from First Great Western and Cross Country Trains ensuring that transport services were maintained while the rain line was shut.' 'It is not acceptable for the main rail link to be shut for long periods of time and we look forward to seeing this commitment from the Government.'","Track running through the town of Dawlish in Devonshire was badly damaged by storm earlier in the year .

"By . Paul Harris . One was a puritan who unseated a monarch in the name of parliamentary democracy. The other was a Communist tyrant whose citizens died by the million during his reign of terror. But yesterday Russian leader Vladimir Putin branded both men dictators – and made the extraordinary claim that there was no real difference between Oliver Cromwell and Joseph Stalin. Asked which Soviet leader he would most like to honour with a statue, Putin stunned his audience by comparing Stalin to Cromwell. Russian leader Vladimir . Putin has made the extraordinary claim that . there was no real difference between Oliver Cromwell (left) and Joseph Stalin (right) ‘How in particular is Cromwell so different from Stalin?’ he asked. ‘Can you tell me? Not in any way at all. From the point of view of liberals, he is the same bloody dictator.’ Mr Putin was speaking at a press conference on plans to restore statues of the Soviet tyrant and other Communist leaders more than two decades after they were toppled. Russian hardliners want to see a monument to Stalin brought back to Moscow. Putin compared the move to the existence of a statue of Cromwell outside the Houses of Parliament.

Of Cromwell – a soldier and statesman . who signed Charles I’s death warrant before becoming England’s Protector . – he said: ‘He was quite a treacherous dude, one has to say. 'And the role he played for Britain was ambiguous. But the monument of him stands there – and no one knocks it down.’ He urged Russians: ‘You know, the point is not in these symbols. 'The point is that we should treat each period of our history with respect. 'Cromwell lived there some time back. For us, this is all very raw. 'So we have to treat each period of our history with care.’ Although some historians dispute the figures, it is widely believed that up to 40million perished under Stalin, half through starvation or imprisonment, the other half helping to defeat Hitler during the Second World War. Around 300,000 are believed to have died during the English Civil War and during Cromwell’s brutal campaigns in Ireland. Putin’s comments came when he was lamenting the break up of the Soviet Union which he described as ‘a tragedy of the 20th Century’. He was talking about plans to restore statues of the Soviet tyrant and other Communist leaders more than two decades after they were toppled.

"By . Paul Harris . They never found his body in the cloying, blood-drenched mud of the Somme. But nearly a century after a young soldier died fighting for king and country, he is about to see service again. Private William Tickle, who lied about his age to join the Army at just 15, is to be immortalised on a Royal Mail stamp bearing his image. Private William Cecil 'Billie' Tickle is to be commemorated on a stamp marking the centenary of the First World War . His photograph will form part of a five-year commemoration of the First World War, honouring the millions of ordinary people who gave their lives for freedom or answered the patriotic call. The stamp – first class, of course – is one of a series being issued ahead of the centenary of the outbreak of war this summer. It uses a portrait of the private in uniform, donated decades ago by his proud mother to the Imperial War Museum so he would not be forgotten. The picture was taken a few days before he was killed and originally bore her poignant, handwritten note beneath: ‘Billie Boy … One of the very best.’ Had she not labelled it so, few would surely remember the name of a young man whose sacrifice echoed that made by so many in ‘the war to end all wars’. William Cecil Tickle was only 15 when he signed up, convincing recruiting officers he was 18. He lived with his family in Hornsey, Middlesex, and joined the Essex Regiment in September 1914. By the time the 9th Battalion was mobilised in France the following spring, the keen young infantryman would have found himself in the company of countless ‘boy soldiers’ who signed up as teenagers. Over the top: Around 1million soldiers were killed or wounded during the battle, 350,000 of them from the UK . Billie, along with thousands of other soldiers that day, was cut down while advancing on German lines . They landed in Boulogne on May 31 and instantly found themselves thrust into battle. After three months they would also fight in the Battle of Loos, among the biggest confrontations of the campaign, in which 16,000 died and 25,000 were wounded among British troops alone. The regiment fought heroically in the Somme, a landscape stripped bare by artillery, tanks and ferocious fighting. Perhaps unsurprisingly for a Tommy named Tickle, the private still managed a smile. In the last photograph of him, sent home to his mother, he is beaming with pride. Shortly after she received it, in July 1916, Private 13510 Tickle was killed in a charge against German lines at Ovillers. Like scores of others, his body was swallowed by the mud and never traced. Elizabeth Tickle never got over the loss of her beloved son but was determined he should be remembered. In 1920 she answered an appeal for photographs of the fallen and it eventually became part of an exhibition in honour of the dead. ‘I should like to feel I can tell my friends that he is there with all his comrades,’ she wrote at the time. ‘He was only a boy but, God love him, he well did his duty.’ Now his image will appear next to the Queen’s head in a series that will also include stamps to commemorate war artists, and the role of women and civilians, among others. The stamps will be issued each year to 2018, starting in July.","Private William Cecil 'Billie' Tickle killed at the Battle of the Somme .

"By . Neil Sears . and Paul Harris . Nigella Lawson pays her children to work for her and 'makes them' appear on her TV cookery shows, she told a court yesterday. Her admission came as details emerged of the gilded lifestyle of her two children by her late first husband John Diamond, and of Charles Saatchi's daughter from a previous relationship, Phoebe. The young trio were supposedly given almost £200 a week each in spending money by one of the housekeepers on trial for stealing from their parents, and also enjoyed numerous meals out at Mr Saatchi's expense. Helpers: Nigella Lawson with her children during an episode of Nigellissima . Miss Lawson's revelation about the paid work she gives her children was in response to questions at Isleworth Crown Court in London yesterday about her household spending. She admitted that she had 'a way  of paying' the university fees of  her children. Barrister Karina Arden, defending Francesca Grillo on a charge of defrauding Miss Lawson and Mr Saatchi, said: 'Were either of your children on your payroll?' Miss Lawson, who has a fortune of around £20million, said: 'I think I've got a way of paying university fees by putting them through a payroll, totally legally, and I declare it. 'I'm afraid to say I make them appear in my television programmes.' Asked by Miss Arden whether appearing on her programmes 'is the only job they do', Miss Lawson replied indignantly: 'No. When I'm testing a new recipe they will taste it as I go. They will do many things I ask of them.' Miss Lawson's revelation about the paid work she gives her children was in response to questions at Isleworth Crown Court in London . But Miss Lawson strongly denied a claim by Miss Arden that Francesca Grillo had used her family credit card with her permission to give the three teenage children cash so regularly it averaged £29,000 a year – almost £200 a week each. Miss Lawson also rejected claims that Francesca would have had to use her family credit card to pay for restaurant meals and takeaways for the children. Miss Lawson said the children could eat at several restaurants on  tabs established by Mr Saatchi, and said they could use the family PayPal account to order takeaways over  the internet. The case continues.","The three children were given cash by one of housekeepers on trial .

"By . Paul Harris . Down in the forest, something stirs. The tops of the pine trees sway a little in the chill, still air and from the ground, you can just hear the faint sound of rustling. Then - as if from nowhere - he takes to the air. Not just with a little jump or a measured step from branch to branch, but an arcing, fully-fledged, death-defying leap into thin air. The Ginger ninja leaps from a log, as photographer Simon Phillpotts is on hand to capture the giant jump . Flying through the air, tiny red squirrel reaches heights of up to 12-feet, launching itself through the treetops . Springing high above the woodland floor, the little fella jumps through the trees high in the Yorkshire Dales . Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it is an incredible flying red squirrel . Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No. It’s the Ginger Ninja of the North Yorkshire Dales - a red squirrel who’s simply nuts about jumping. His antics were captured by photographer Simon Phillpotts as part of a project to celebrate the area’s red squirrel population, slowly re-establishing itself after decades of absence under threat of extinction. Even among fellow red squirrels, this particular one appears to be a champion. The photographs capture him leaping up to 12ft from a standing start on the ground, and flying through the air with the greatest of ease as he jumps from tree to tree in the forests around Wensleydale. Given that he’s only 18 inches long at full stretch, it’s quite a feat. Were a human able to replicate it inch for inch, it would be the equivalent of jumping 40ft or hurdling a Transit van. Photographer Simon Philpotts said: They have little fear but their secret is their hooked claws, which they can deploy to give as much grip as they need' Mr Phillpotts captured the stunning series of images of the leaping red squirrel as part of a project to celebrate the area's red squirrel population . The population of red squirrels in the North Yorkshire Dales is slowly re-establishing itself after decades of absence under threat of extinction . Not to mention landing perfectly on the other side before taking off again. ‘Red squirrels are extremely agile,’ Mr Phillpotts said. ‘Most of my pictures are taken a few feet off the ground but they regularly jump around the tree canopy 70ft up in the air. 'They have little fear but their secret is their hooked claws, which they can deploy to give as much grip as they need.’ And the Ginger Ninja’s Olympic performance? ‘Different individuals have different characters and abilities,’ he said - other squirrels he filmed were less willing to jump so spectacularly. Eurasian Red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) are native to the British Isles but were almost wiped out in large parts of the country after grey squirrels were introduced in 1876 from North America. The greys carry a deadly squirrel pox virus but are immune to it; red squirrels are not. Hence, there are currently an estimated three million greys in the UK compared to fewer than 135,000 reds, 75 per cent of which are in Scotland. In North Yorkshire, a conservation partnership has been working to build up the still-fragile population and numbers are visibly increasing. So could ginger Ninjas eventually take over the world? To be fair, that’s probably a jump too far. But Mr Dale and conservationists are hopeful they will be a more common sight in the future. England's last red squirrels might be hemmed in by their grey cousins, but they are still leaping free in their own woodlands . The tiny creature leapt up to six times the height of its 18-inch body, the equivalent of a human leaping over a Ford Transit van .","Simon Phillpotts captured the tiny red squirrel leaping from trees .

"By . Paul Harris . When you reach the ripe old age of 160million, life can surely hold few surprises. But even Misty the diplodocus might have raised an eyebrow yesterday when someone paid nearly half a million pounds to give her a new home. Her skeleton, which measures 55ft long and is taller than a double-decker bus, was sold at auction for £488,000. Ready for her close-up: Misty is dusted off for auction at Summer Place Auctions in West Sussex . Relic: The ancient skeleton was found in the US state of Wyoming in 2009 . The sale was a new chapter in the life (and death) of Misty, a magnificent diplodocus longus who roamed the earth in the late Jurassic period. Full diplodocus skeletons are extremely rare. Even Dippy, the celebrated centrepiece of the Natural History Museum in London, is a plaster-cast replica drawn from two sets of remains, and it was 1877 before any fossilised remains of a diplodocus were discovered. What no one knew then was that Misty was waiting to be unearthed in Ten Sleep, a fossil-rich quarry in Wyoming owned by renowned paleontologist Raimund Albersdoerfer. One day in 2009 he sent his two young sons out ‘to get them off my back’ and to see what they could dig up. To his astonishment, they returned saying they had discovered an enormous bone beneath the silt. Albersdoerfer’s professional team spent the next nine weeks digging out the dinosaur, which they nicknamed Misty, short for Mysterious. Scrubbed up: Misty was bought anonymously by a private institution - but they promised to keep her on display . Lengthy: Misty is 55ft long, thanks to her huge neck and tail . She was found at the edge of a dried-up watering hole and is believed to have come to grief after her enormous weight - probably 15 tons - caused her to get stuck in the mud. Predatory dinosaurs probably did the rest. Her remains were collected and shipped off to be painstakingly prepared at a leading fossil laboratory in the Netherlands. She was sent to England for reassembly and put up for sale at Summers Place auctions in West Sussex. The auction house, which more commonly sells garden sculpture and decorative fossils, staged an ‘Evolution Sale’ that included a dodo pelvis, an Ichthyosaurus fossil and a stuffed horse. Dig: Misty was excavated by a team led by paleontologist Raimund Albersdoefer . Getting stuck in: Mr Albersdoerfer revealed that Misty was found when he sent his son out digging one afternoon . It was overseen by auction curator and natural history specialist Errol Fuller, who recently wrote a book with Sir David Attenborough and is an expert on extinct species. Mr Fuller is a friend of Mr Albersdoerfer and helped bring Misty to Britain when the paleontologist, who is German, said he wanted to auction her in Europe. ‘I’m sure the Americans are upset at losing it,’ Mr Fuller said. ‘But they already have two or three of them in collections.’ It is understood interest was shown from the fast-developing natural history market in China, Asia and the Middle East. In the end she was bought anonymously for an unnamed private institution – with a pledge to put her on public display.","The magnificent creature would have been alive in the Jurassic period .

But even 40 years after Carl Barlow first pushed his baker’s-boy bike up the dauntingly mountainous hill, he couldn’t resist doing it again for old time’s sake. And so, with a full basket of bread – and a considerable amount of middle-age huff and puff – he donned his cloth cap and set off up the most famous cobbled street in TV advertising. Scroll down for video . Carl Barlow has returned to the scene of the Hovis advert on Gold Hill in Shaftesbury, Dorset, after 40 years . The advert was filmed 40 years ago and has become one of the most famous scenes in British TV history . The voiceover for the advert is provided by the delivery boy who is now grown up. He is reminiscing about his days as a youngster when he did his bread round. To the sound of a brass band playing Dvorak's New World Symphony, he states: 'Last stop on round would be Old Ma Peggoty's place. 'T'was like taking bread to top of the world. 'T'was a grand ride back though. I'd knew baker have kettle on and doorsteps of old Hovis ready. '""There's wheatgearm in that loaf,"" he'd day. ""Get it inside you boy and you'll be going up that hill as fast as you come down.'"" The boy is seen in the advert struggling to push his bike to the top of the hill but is sat astride it and joyously freewheeling down it after making the delivery. He is then seen returning to the bakery and tucking into Hovis bread. The Hovis delivery lad was back in . business. Not to recreate the nation’s best-loved ad though, but as a . celebrity invited to turn on a town’s Christmas lights. He . was 13 and at stage school in 1973 when he first scaled the hill to . star in a  commercial that earned itself a slice of British history. The . short film by Ridley Scott – now an Oscar-nominated Hollywood director – . shows Carl slogging up the one-in-four gradient to a brass-band . soundtrack of Dvorak’s New World symphony, set against the backdrop of a . fictional northern industrial town. Fictional, . because it was actually filmed on picturesque Gold Hill in Shaftesbury, . Dorset, one of the steepest residential streets in Britain and hundreds . of miles from the grime and belching smoke of a bygone age up North. It . showed Carl with a pudding basin haircut beneath a flat cap, struggling . with  the fully laden bike to deliver a loaf to Old Ma Peggoty’s house . at the top of the hill. In triumph, he then freewheels down at breakneck speed with his legs splayed out from the pedals. The advert won a clutch of accolades and was voted more than three decades later as Britain’s all-time favourite. Mr Barlow was invited back to the West Country village this week to turn on its Christmas lights . Although . he was paid handsomely for his endeavours (£60), he did not go on to . make the big time, preferring instead to earn his crust as a fireman. He recently retired from London Fire Brigade after a 30-year career. But the people of Shaftesbury never forgot the young lad who helped to put Gold Hill on the tourist map. On Monday they afforded him VIP status to switch on the festive lights, and yesterday he recalled his moment of stardom. Mr Barlow said: 'The advert has been such a big part of my life and it really captured the hearts of the nation' ‘Three . boys were auditioned,’ he said. ‘One couldn’t ride a bike, one wasn’t . prepared to cut his hair, and I was happy to do both. ‘It was cold, but I soon warmed up – I had to push the bike up the hill many times for the best part of two days filming.’ He admitted that doing it again was more of a slog at the age of 54. Surely going downhill was fun though? ‘I wouldn’t even consider doing it now,’ he said. ‘It’s far too steep.’","Carl Barlow was 13 when he pushed his bicycle up Gold Hill in Shaftesbury, Dorset .

"Japan coach Alberto Zaccheroni feels his side need to go back to basics if they are to stand any chance of keeping their World Cup dream alive. The Blue Samurai failed to break down the determined resistance of 10-man Greece in a frustrating goalless draw in Natal on Thursday night, which leaves them with just one point going into their final Group C match against Colombia. The Colombians have already qualified for the last 16 after beating Ivory Coast 2-1 in Brasilia. Back to basics: Japan coach Alberto Zaccheroni has called on his side to rediscover their form from qualifying when they face Colombia in their final World Cup group match . Frustrating night: Japan were unable to convert any of their chances in the 0-0 draw with Greece, leaving them with just one point from their opening two World Cup group matches . Japan must now win on Tuesday and also hope the result between Greece and Ivory Coast goes their way for the Asian champions to remain in Brazil. Zaccheroni hopes his men can rediscover the form they showed in qualifying, when they were the first side to reach the finals. 'Japan should be brave enough to play at the international level by imposing its game on opponents and playing fast,' the Italian said. 'In the last two games unfortunately we were not able to play with the speed we were accustomed to.' Forward Yoshito Okubo, who had spells in Europe at Real Mallorca and Wolfsburg, accepts it was a missed opportunity having seen Greek captain Konstantinos Katsouranis dismissed on 38 minutes following two yellow cards as Japan could not find a finish past goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis despite plenty of positive build-up. Missed opportunities: Yoshito Okubo rues a missed chance as Japan were held by Greece in Natal . Numerical disadvantage: Japan were unable to capitalise when Konstantinos Katsouranis (No 21) was sent off by referee Joel Aguilar . 'They were down one man and became really defensive, but we had a lot of opportunities in the second half and we could have won if we had finished,' Okubo said. 'We were able to pass the ball in midfield so we have to practice feeding the ball (to the front). 'It was a wasted opportunity, and it was shameful. 'We have one more match and I will devote myself fully (to getting the victory).' Despite being overrun in midfield, the Greeks still had some chances of their own. Fine margins: Greece's Vasilis Torosidis reacts after failing to covert a chance . Vasilis Torosidis forced a fine save from Eiji Kawashima, who in the second half then pushed away a bullet header from substitute Theofanis Gekas and former Celtic frontman Georgios Samaras glanced a late chance wide. Greece went down 3-0 to Colombia in their opening Group C match, but Fernando Santos's squad could yet progress should they beat Ivory Coast and Japan fail to win in Cuiaba. Defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos said. 'We have a point and we have hope. 'If things go well we can get four points with a win in the next game - and if God decides that we are eliminated because of the other result, then so be it.' Greece will check on the fitness of Kostas Mitroglou after the Fulham forward hobbled off during the first half against Japan.","Japan failed to break down the resistance of 10-man Greece in second World Cup match .

"By . Neil Sears . and Paul Harris . Charles Saatchi disliked credit cards so much he kept a ‘huge stash’ of cash in a plastic bag on the fridge, the court heard. As yet more details of the couple’s astonishing lifestyle were revealed, Miss Lawson told the court that none of her personal assistants were authorised to make personal purchases or withdraw cash without her or Mr Saatchi’s permission. She claimed she was not even allowed to take out money herself using the credit cards, and that Mr Saatchi used to leave cash around the house for her and their aides. Family support: A weary-loooking Nigella Lawson leaves court with her brother Dominic last night . ‘Charles kept a huge stash of cash above the fridge,’ Miss Lawson said. ‘He put it in a lunch plastic zippy freezer bag above the fridge. I think he did like a huge wad of cash because he didn’t like to use credit cards himself’. Miss Lawson was in the witness box in the trial of Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo,who are accused of stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds from Miss Lawson and Mr Saatchi while in their service. She was also quizzed about the large number of heavy outgoings made by her former assistants Alice Binks, Anzelle Wasserman, and Zoe Wales. The trio were spending a monthly average of £6,000, £8,000, and £3,000 on trips to Annabel’s nightclub, the Babington House country venue, and on Christian Louboutin shoes. Anthony Metzer QC, representing Elisabetta, asked Miss Lawson whether she had approved a £7,916 payment on Miss Binks’s company credit card to trendy east London private members’ club Shoreditch House in January last year. Miss Lawson said that the payment was for her 53rd birthday party and another was for her daughter Mimi’s 18th birthday bash. Publicity: The celebrity chef (centre) was  met by a media scrum as she left Isleworth Crown Court . She also claimed that the other payments to Annabel’s nightclub in central London’s Mayfair were made to buy wine for Mr Saatchi. The court heard that Mr Saatchi also told Miss Wasserman to make payments to online ticket vendor, Ticketstosee, worth thousands of pounds so his daughter Phoebe could attend sold-out concerts. ‘Ticketstosee is a company that gets tickets for quite hard to get to performers,’ Miss Lawson said. ‘So for example, Mr Saatchi instructed Ms Wales to get tickets for my step-daughter to see Kanye West.’ Prosecutors claim the Italian sisters lived the ‘high life’, spending the money on designer clothes and handbags from Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Vivienne Westwood. Miss Lawson said she did offer to buy the sisters presents on special occasions and once allowed them to buy a pair of £60 shoes that she was buying for herself. She said: ‘Afterwards I thought they must have been laughing at me, £60, what is that to them?’ Miss Lawson refuted Mr Metzer’s claim that she would use credit cards belonging to Mr Saatchi to pay for exercise classes, manicures and pedicures. I paid for them sometimes by cash and sometimes by cheque,’ she said, adding: ‘Personal trainers don’t take credit cards.’ In relation to whether she bought gifts for Elisabetta, who is known as Lisa, she said: ‘She might say, “Look at these shoes in Vogue” and I would say, “You know, darling, let me buy you those shoes”.’ But she said it would be a particular gift. Questioned by Mr Metzer about her other personal assistants’ credit card statements showing expenditure at Annabel’s in central London, Miss Lawson said it referred not to the nightclub but to Annabel’s wine cellar ‘for Mr Saatchi’s wine’. Mr Metzer mentioned sums including £1,368, and a separate sum of £1,300 which he said was spent in five days at the establishment. ‘Mr Saatchi likes to drink wine and he likes to drink expensive wine,’ she said. Questioned by Mr Metzer about payments made on a Vodafone account and a private medical payment made by another assistant, Miss Lawson said she did not realise the other witnesses in the trial were “under suspicion”. The court heard that a sum of £7,916.10 was spent in Shoreditch House, which Miss Lawson said she presumed was her birthday party. Miss Lawson was questioned about money spent at upmarket clothing store Joseph of London on dresses bought for her by Mr Saatchi. ‘Mr Saatchi very generously said, “I want you to have lots of them”,’ she said, adding that he ‘wanted to buy up every single one of those dresses’. Entrance: Miss Lawson arriving at court to testify at the trial of assistants Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo . Embarrassingly for Miss Lawson it emerged that one payment of £2,300 on the Mr Saatchi credit card given to her assistant Alice Binks had been for a beauty treatment a lady does not normally discuss in public – and it seemed to have been for Miss Lawson. Asked what the payment to a Dr Andrew Markie could be for, Miss Lawson said: ‘Laser hair removal. It wasn’t for her.’ Miss Lawson admitted at one point: ‘I’m guilty of being extravagant’, depite spending only a fraction of the sums attained by the Grillo sisters on the family credit cards. But she also gave an intriguing insight into Mr Saatchi’s courtship of her a decade ago – when it seems the £100million tycoon failed to pay the bill for their dates, leaving her to pick up the bill. Miss Lawson let it slip while explaining why her ex-husband was happy to pay for a lot of her purchases in recent years. Miss Lawson said: ‘He was very generous, and if it wasn’t a business purchase for me he was happy to fund it -–particularly as I had spent a long period with the restaurants that we went to and everything on my card, and he wanted to redress that.’ The court has heard that Miss Lawson and Mr Saatchi paid Francesca £28,000 a year while Lisa earned £25,000. Yet . Francesca’s spending between 2008 and June last year totaled over . £580,000, with her older sister Lisa’s spree during the same time frame . hitting an estimated £105,000. On average Francesca’s monthly outgoings were £48,000 while Lisa’s were £28,000. Rahul . Gajjar, the finance director at the Saatchi Gallery Group, has . previously told the court that he kept increasing the Grillos’ monthly . limit once he received Mr Saatchi’s approval. But he did not tell Mr . Saatchi or Miss Lawson that he had raised Francesca’s card limit to . £100,000 a month. Accused: Lisa and Francesca Grillo . In better times, Elizabetta Grillo was Nigella Lawson’s ‘rock’. Yesterday, the 41-year-old wept in the dock at Isleworth Crown Court as the TV cook told how she had loved her and would never forget what she had done for her. But the celebrity chef was also frank in saying that things had changed dramatically.Both Elisabetta and her sister Francesca, 35, had ‘flabbergasted’ Miss Lawson by stealing a fortune from her and her ex-husband Charles Saatchi – a sum she estimated to be ‘a lot higher’ than the £685,000 they are accused of taking. And Miss Lawson said Elisabetta, known as Lisa and who first came to work for her when her first husband John Diamond was dying of cancer, had compounded her crime by falsely accusing her of being addicted to cocaine. Miss Lawson said: ‘Lisa had been a stalwart and had helped me through a very difficult time when my first husband died. I loved Lisa. My children loved Lisa. She was a rock. I would have done anything for her.’ But her ‘fantasist’ sister Francesca also started working for the family and may have influenced her as she began stealing, said Miss Lawson. She said ‘a strange sense of entitlement’ seemed to be behind the alleged frauds. Miss Lawson added: ‘I would like Lisa to admit to what she’s done.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Nigella Lawson was not allowed to take money out herself .

"By . Martha Cliff . Lara Stone and her gap-toothed grin burst onto the fashion scene in 2006 when she was dubbed an 'alternative' model for her imperfect teeth and curvacious figure. And now the Dutch model's money-making mouth makes its return in Stella McCartney's latest fragrance campaign. The 30-year-old appears in a shoot and video for the signature STELLA fragrance, which combines notes of rose, amber and peony, and was originally launched in 2003. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Lara Stone makes a sultry return as the face of Stella McCartney's fragrance STELLA . During the video a completely naked Lara bites on a STELLA perfume bottle made of ice, with the camera focusing on her prominent gap. The campaign posters are equally risque with the dark purple bottle protruding from Lara's dewy lips and her gleaming white teeth resting on top of the perfume. The fragrance focuses on the model's famous gap tooth . The Dutch model is in high demand at the moment, having recently landed a campaign with Calvin Klein and appeared in a shoot for Net-a-Porter's The Edit. Designer Stella McCartney claims she could see no other model fit to represent her signature fragrance: 'STELLA is a celebration of women, and . Lara is the perfect representation. 'She brings the ideas of the . fragrance alive, in an honest way, she is a modern woman who is . approachable and sensual at the same time', says the 42-year-old. STELLA was originally launched back in 2003 and was the designer's debut fragrance. It was inspired by the notion of the English rose and took influence from Stella's country home. Signature scent: The designer says that the fragrance, that originally launched in 2003,  is so true to the brand that it didn't need updating . The original scent remains unchanged but the perfume bottle has been updated and now comes with a gold collar and the outer carton is covered in cute gold polka dots. Stella added: 'When we created STELLA, we created a scent so true to the brand, it was an effortless extension of the Stella McCartney brand and still stands for today' The new-look packaging for STELLA will be previewed in Harrods throughout July and will be available nationwide from 1st August.","Lara Stone is the new face of the fragrance STELLA .

"By . Martha Cliff . Ponies, iPads and enough handbags to make Victoria Beckham blush: no, these aren't the contents of Harrods but some of the many gifts bestowed on 12-year-old Chase McKenna. Like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's Veruca Salt, Chase, and her siblings Mackenzie, seven and Rhys, 14, are given everything they could possibly dream of by doting parents, Kelly and Alan, both 33. 'I like labels: Ralph, Juicy, Gucci,' reveals the 12-year-old, who lives with her family in Bexley, of her lavish wardrobe. 'I don't do Primark!' Expensive tastes: Chase McKenna says she won't wear Primark and only likes Gucci and Ralph Lauren clothes . Now junior pageant queen Chase and her two siblings are to appear on new Channel 5 documentary, The 12 Year Old Shopaholic and Other Big Spending Kids. In it, she shows off her favourite clothes, most of which are by Ralph Lauren and Gucci, as well as her pony, which costs her parents £2,000 a year to maintain. But while Chase and her penchant for expensive clothes might sound like most parent's worst nightmare, her mother Kelly reveals that Chase is exactly what she hoped she'd be and says she has dressed her in designer gear since birth. 'I had my kids young and I felt like if I dressed them in designer gear then people would think I was doing an alright job,' she admits. Unsurprisingly, Chase's demands have grown increasingly lavish - and that's before you get to her impressively large allowance. Scary: If Chase doesn't get what she wants, she gives her father what she calls 'The Face' 'I've . already had £150 this week and it’s only Tuesday' smirks the . 12-year-old, 'If I ask Dad for something and don't get a yes straight . away I give him ""The Face"".' And . it seems the threat of getting 'The Face' is enough to persuade father . Alan to part with just about any sum of money Chase cares to name. 'I say: ""Oh, Daddy, pleeease?"" And he goes: ""OK, how much do you want?"" and I go: ""Can I have £300?"" Each time I go higher.' But of all the presents Chase has been given, the most expensive was her pony - which even her mother said gave her pause for thought. 'We weren't 100 per cent on the horse because it costs £2,000 a year to take care of and we said no to start but Chase really . proved herself,' says Kelly. 'She gave up her weekends and mucked out the horse and Alan enjoys the horse too so everyone benefits.' So how exactly do the young couple fund their prima donna daughter's extravagant spending habits? 'Alan has his own building company and I don't work,' explains Kelly.  'We are useless with money but we're not on benefits. Alan works for it.' Spoilt: Like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's Veruca Salt, Chase gets everything she wants . Nevertheless, although the McKenna children do get just about everything their hearts could desire, Kelly says there have been moments when they've struggled with money. 'There was a time a few months ago when we had no work and the kids were . as good as gold,' she reveals. 'They didn't ask for anything. Rhys who's only 14 even . got a gardening job to help out.' 'People say to me: ""Get a grip girl! You've got no carpet and your kids are running around in Ralph Lauren jeans!""' She does, however, think her spending habits are spiralling out of control and says she needs to get a grip. 'People say to me: ""Get a grip girl! You've got no carpet and your kids are running around in Ralph Lauren jeans!""' According to Kelly, her erratic spending habits were inherited from her own mother who also took a cavalier approach to money. 'My mum and dad split up and she had to work two jobs so we didn't have a normal upbringing,' explains Kelly. 'Some days, we would get picked up by Lamborghinis and limousines from school. Some days my mum would be rooting around in the cupboards and others we would be in a posh restaurant. I think she was trying to find a substitute for my dad not being there.' That, however, hasn't stopped her from following suit. 'My mum always said: ""You're not here forever so spend it while you can"" and I think she's right.' But does she worry that Chase, so keen to splash her father's cash, will grow up with the same attitude to money. Amazingly, Kelly thinks not. 'No,' she insists.

"By . Martha Cliff . Prince George who celebrated his first birthday yesterday, has undeniably earned himself the title of Royal cutie but it looks like the one-year-old may grow up to be a real Prince Charming. Hungarian graphic designer and illustrator, Nikolett Mérész has created an image of what young Prince George might look like at the age of 18. The artist referred to the genetic traits that George has developed from his mother and father when using a computer to generate the final image. Scroll down for video . A glimpse of things to come? Hungarian artist Nikolett Mérészhas created an image of how Prince George may look at 18 (left) In order to predict what the Prince may look like as an adult the artist studied his current appearance very carefully. Nikolett, 30, also referred back to images of the Royal baby's parents when they were younger in order to create an accurate prediction of his future appearance. She told the Herald Sun: 'Prince George has a very similar face to William’s when he was a . toddler. But, at the same time, his cheeks look a lot like baby Kate’s . and that can’t be ignored. Especially as Kate has dimples, which are . also a dominant trait, so it’s very likely George will have them as . well.' Nikolett referred back to images of Kate and William when predicting George's appearance at 18 . According to Nikolett, George should expect to develop his mother's dimples (left) but should avoid his father's thinning hair (right) In order to make the final product the artist combined the current facial traits of both George's parents. 'To create the remainder of the image, I merged Kate’s hairline, ears . and edge of mouth with William’s nose, brows, forehead and lips.' Although we can expect George to develop the same enviable dimples of his mother and face shapes of his father there are some attributes that the Prince can expect to avoid. Nikolett referred back to images of Kate (left) and William (right) when they were babies while creating the future-image of George . Nikolett continued to say that she didn't believe that George would suffer from the same hair thinning that we have recently noticed on his father Prince William. 'It looks likely that George won't go bald, as that trait is passed down on the mother's side, and given her brother James and father Michael's full heads of hair, the little prince should also keep hold of his!'

"By . Martha Cliff . For those of us who dream of festive food treats but expect to be on a tighter budget this year, Aldi has potentially provided a solution. Scrimping shoppers can look forward to a feast of caviar, whole crab and king prawns this December - all on a shoestring budget. The discount supermarket has announced that its Christmas offerings are inspired by Michelin-starred restaurants. Festive and fancy: Aldi's Christmas offerings for 2014 are based on Michelin-starred restaurants (actual food not pictured) This follows a report in May that found that budget supermarkets are becoming increasingly popular with - and are now fiercely competing to cater to - the middle-class. To which end, Aldi is reaching above and beyond with its Christmas menu this year, offering up with king scallops in garlic butter, a hidden-centre Christmas pudding and smoked salmon, among other treats. The supermarket's five bird roast is undergoing an upgrade for Christmas 2014, now containing  turkey, goose, duck, pheasant and chicken, all wrapped in bacon. The budget supermarket is becoming increasingly popular with the middle-class shopper . A survey for Good Housekeeping magazine found that 53 per cent of . shoppers had switched to cheaper stores or divided the shop between a . supermarket and budget store since the recession. The poll found more . than 40 per cent shop regularly at Aldi and Lidl, with just 2 per cent saying they would be too embarrassed to shop in discount stores. Aldi has not yet revealed prices for the products, but based on previous years it looks to be an affordable array. For example, a packet of 12 pork and chestnut stuffing balls cost £2.19, while the pure-breed British Turkey (3-5kg) retailed at £39.99. And last year its £1.69 Christmas mince pies . trumped brands almost eight times more expensive in an annual taste test . by a major consumer group, which also bodes well for this year's offering. Aldi's Christmas range will start to appear in stores from mid October.","The supermarket is becoming increasingly popular with the middle classes .

To celebrate the first birthday of the nation's beloved Prince George, FEMAIL launched a picture competition last week, asking readers to nominate their little lookalike princes (and princesses). The response was phenomenal and we received thousands of entries, from those who looked scarily similar to George, to those who were perhaps long lost cousins. We even had a few parents who tried to enter themselves as Duke and Duchess doppelgängers! However, our hunt is over, and we have found a baby so alike to His Royal Highness that he ought to start practicing a finger painting signature.

Doppelganger: 11-month-old Marc (left) is the winner of our Prince George lookalike competition - and as these photos reveal, he's the very image of the young royal (right) The judging panel agreed that it is . Marc's adorable chubby cheeks and wide-eyed look that helps him bear such a . striking resemblance to the young Prince. The two boys are also of very similar ages meaning that their height and body stature is almost identical. However, . the most noticeable similarity between the two babies was the prominent . eyebrows that both boys have, with George taking after his father Prince . William. Nella Nam, Marc's mother, says that like Prince George, Marc has just started to take his first steps. Separated at birth? The judging panel agreed that both Marc (left) and Prince George (right) shared the same chubby cheeks and bold eyebrows . 'He's very energetic like the Prince and just starting on his feet,' she said. She adds that her little prince is already a bit of a connoisseur when it comes to dinner time. 'Marc is a . very loveable cuddly boy but he has very picky taste already in food! He can never get enough of cheese sandwiches! There has to be always one . in his hand.' When . it comes to entertainment Marc has to do without royal tours and . stuffed bilbys but has developed a taste for the high tech. Drooling with delight: Marc pulls the perfect George pout at his baptism . They could be twins! Marc (left) and George (right) share the same fair hair, curious expression and cheeks . 'Cbeebies is a show that keeps him occupied the whole day and he's already tech savvy enough to try and turn on the episodes on my iPad.' It isn't just the MailOnline who have picked up on the identical features of the two boys, Nella says that friends constantly compare her son to the young Prince. 'Since I have put his pictures up everyone has noticed the similarities so it would be something very special for him to be remembered as prince George's 1 year old birthday doppelgänger!'

"By . Martha Cliff . We all remember the controversial Facebook campaign Women Who Eat on Tubes, the fat-shaming fad in which users uploaded anonymous pictures of women munching away on public transport, sparking outrage amongst women, feminists and TFL alike. However it seems that no matter what your size, you can come under fire - as a new Instagram trend dubbed 'thin shaming' proves. You Did Not Eat That was set up in April by an anonymous user and regrams images of slender women posing with fatty foods with the hashtag #youdidnoteatthat (YDNET) - and has already gained a following of 96,576 people. Scroll down for video . Did she, didn't she? Abbey Clancy poses with a calorie-laden hotdog . Claiming these women are simply using the food as accessories, its tag line reads: 'Speaking the truth in this mixed up world of too many macaroons and ice cream cones used as props.

Recalling one particular instance that made her blood boil, she told New York magazine: 'A month ago I saw dozens of bloggers swarming a dessert table, taking pictures and spending five minutes merchandizing the sunglasses next to the macaroons.

Despite being adamant that her account is all in good humour, YDNET has been met with severe criticism, with many claiming that it will only encourages stigmas around food. Therapist Rachel Morris says that there could be something far deeper behind the desire to document a diet of high-fat foods. She worries that the reason for the photos could be Liarexia, whereby women order huge portions of food when out with others, but dramatically restrict their portions in private. 'Liarexia can be a form of eating disorder,' says Rachel, 'It's connected to feeling shame around food and it's often sparked by fear of being challenged by other people.' Yeah right: Mollie King poses with an all-American feast, yet the food seems untouched . Hungry for more: Jessie J digs into a whole pizza, but was she sharing? Unlikely candidate: Brazillian model Alessandra Ambrosio seems to be enjoying her steak and chip dinner . Despite this worrying information, YDNET's creator insists that she is not targeting women, she simply wants to see a bit more honesty. 'This is not me making some huge social commentary about what size somebody is and what they're eating. This is more like, Come on, we see the formula. You look awesome!

"By . Martha Cliff . The owner of one of Britain's oldest family-run market stalls has finally closed his market stall after 163 years of business. Located in Sheffield, N Smith and Sons, has sold handbags and purses to hundreds of thousands of customers since its opening in 1851 and has been run by more than seven generations of the same family. Now known as Smiths, it had been passed down from father to son with the latest owner being Paul Smith. Paul Smith will see his beloved stall close after 163 years of trading . When Smiths originally opened way back in 1851, business was booming. However, after customers dwindled to just nine a day, Paul says the family have struggled to meet even the service charge. Paul says that his small family stall hasn't been able to compete with nearby supermarkets, shopping centres and online shops that offer the same stock for a much cheaper price. Paul, 52, says that the way we shop has completely changed since the stall opened and unfortunately Smiths couldn't keep up. 'There is too much competition. Everything we sell is now on the high street or in a supermarket, when years ago there wasn't anything like that.' Paul said, explaining that it wasn't just Smiths that was suffering. Founder of the stall Noah Smith and his brother are pictured outside their stall in 1906 (far right) Smiths was opened by Noah Smith  in the Norfolk Market Hall in 1851, left and right show the stall 85 years into business in 1936 . 'Markets have been going downhill for years - we just can’t compete with the big retailers any more. When it comes to offering a bargain, stall holders aren't even in the same league. 'And when it comes to quality, people can pick up good bargains online these days or they can head to an out-of-town retail park - which will offer free parking right outside the shop you want. 'Why would you put yourself through the hassle of driving to the city centre, paying extortionate parking fees and then looking round the market? We’ve just had to accept that things have changed - and we’re getting out now.' For Paul the closing of the stall isn't just a financial loss, but a sentimental one too. He grew up in the hustle and bustle of Castle Market, taking over from his dad Gerard 30 years ago. Paul and his wife Vicky (pictured) say they can no longer compete with the high street and online retailers . Paul even met his wife Vicky, also 52, at the stall when she was employed by his parents - she continued to work there for 36 years. Vicky agrees that their small stall has no chance of competing with the multi-million pound brands that offer the same stock. 'Retail has changed. There used to be customers four or five deep, it was buzzing and there was a lot of camaraderie,' says the 52-year-old. 'But . back then there was no Tesco or anything, the market was all there was. Now there is too much retail and everybody is taking a little bit.' Paul admits that the business has been sinking for a long time and says that he has already spent too much trying to keep the stall afloat. For Vicky the closure of the shop will be deeply personal - she's worked there for 36 years and met her husband there when she was employed by his parents at the age of 16 . 'It’s sad to say, but I’ve thrown away as much money as I can for sentimental reasons and now we’ve got to accept the way it is.' They say business has struggled since the market was moved to the new Moor Market site in Sheffield. 'We said we would give the new market a try - but the reason we . think it hasn’t worked is there's no real demand for markets now,' says Paul. He added that smaller towns may still have a need for a market but he wouldn't be surprised if they disappeared in urban areas altogether. 'It might not be the case in more rural areas, where people rely on a . market, but in large cities markets could soon be a thing of the past.' Sheffield Council said it is looking at changing opening hours so as many people as possible can shop there. Leigh Bramall, council cabinet member for business, said three new . traders had joined the market and three more had doubled the size of . their stalls. Leigh added that the council would not give up on their local traders, 'We will continue to support all traders and help them promote their businesses to the people of Sheffield.' Smiths will close for the final time on Saturday, June 28. The family said it would be a sad day, and thanked customers. Smiths will close for good on Saturday 28th June .","Smiths handbag stall in Sheffield will close after 163 years of trading .

"By . Ruth Styles . and Martha Cliff . He's the former child star turned documentary maker and now Tyger Drew-Honey has set his sights on explaining why modern men are coming under increasing pressure to look good. In the latest episode of his BBC3 series, Tyger Takes On..., Drew-Honey, 18, meets the boys and men going to extreme lengths to look good, whether that means surgery or steroids. 'One guy I met was Marcus who had taken so many . steroids that he had had a heart attack at 18,' reveals the star, incredulous. Working out: Drew-Honey is tackling male body image in the latest episode of his BBC documentary series . 'He didn’t want to show us his body because he felt ashamed of it . but I looked at it on Instagram later and he was ripped. 'He had an . amazing body and it seemed mental that he thought there was something . wrong with that.' And it's not just insecurities about muscle mass that plagues British men. According to eating disorders charity beat, males make up anywhere between 10 per cent and a quarter of anorexia and bulimia sufferers. So why are men going to extreme lengths to look good? According to Drew-Honey, natural competitiveness should bear some of the blame. 'It’s this idea of being competitive,' explains the 18-year-old star. 'We . see all these pictures of underwear models and pictures on the Instagram . because, essentially, we communicate through pictures these days. Unhealthy: Many men, desperate to get a bodybuilder look, are overusing steroids in a bid to gain muscle mass . Pressure: Men's bodies are coming under the same sort of scrutiny as women's do . 'We are . all in a race and we’re gonna go mad. We get more and more competitive . and then eventually we are in competition with ourselves.' Making it worse, he reveals, is the celebrity selfie culture which projects an ideal that the majority of teenagers and twenty-somethings will never achieve. 'People use this selfie culture . as a way of advertising themselves,' he adds, 'and people constantly feel have to live up . to the perfection that they see on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram more . and more.' What's more, this is one teen trend that isn't just about impressing the girls. 'There is that idea of looking good for . the opposite sex but a lot of the time men want to impress other men,' explains Drew-Honey. 'When I was hanging around with the boys in Coventry [for the documentary], they said they . didn’t care what the women thought - they only cared about what the men said and not . because they were gay but because of their competitive nature.' And Drew-Honey himself isn't immune to the lure of a ripped pair of abs. 'I think my main insecurities are with my . body,' he confesses. 'My body is . alright, I watch what I eat and try not to eat loads but I enjoy the . odd bit of chocolate. But I don’t do masses [of exercise] although I do walk my dog.' Less charitable types might be inclined to write off the sufferings of men as nothing much - particularly in light of the pressure that women have suffered for years. Insecure: Tyger (right) with some of the stars of the show, from left, Mitch, Sammy and James . Drew-Honey, however, says this is missing the point. 'I think that the issue . with women was right to be addressed because of . all the issues that followed size zero models and so on contributing anorexia and . bulimia. 'But men’s insecurities need to be addressed too because there are a . lot of issues with guys taking loads of steroids and visiting the gym . constantly. He adds: 'I think if there was a boy or a girl who didn’t have any . insecurities that would be ridiculous - everybody feels insecure . sometimes and I don’t think anyone will ever be completely happy with . how they look.'

"By . Martha Cliff . Supermarket wines have once again proven that they are not to be sniffed at as own-brand bottles bag 360 medals at the Golden Aisle International Wine Challenge. Winners included a £5.25 Aldi sherry and a £6 Asda sauvignon blanc as well as Marks & Spencer, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Waitrose, and Morrisons all picking up gold awards. The IWC (International Wine Challenge) assesses every wine 'blind' and judges each for its faithfulness to . style, region and vintage. Good value: There's no need to splash out on fancy wines after supermarket own brands win gold awards . Each award-winning wine is tasted on at . least three separate occasions by a minimum of ten different judges, . including Masters of Wine. This year, the IWC hosted two tasting events for the first time, Tranche 1 in November 2013 and . Tranche 2 in April 2014, to accommodate the different production and . sales schedules across the industry, and give winemakers two opportunities to enter their wines - with the second round producing more supermarket winners than ever before. Marks & Spencer held on to its superior status - being awarded the highest number of gold medals for six wines, continuing its 2013 success (when it was named IWC Supermarket of the Year).

Marks and Spencer's Spanish wines both retailing at £8 were awarded gold medals . If you're not quite able to stretch to M&S bubbly prices, then Sainsbury's and Waitrose are a happy compromise with both supermarkets delighting the judges with their great-value fizz and each receiving four gold awards. Sainsbury's 2013 Taste the Difference Conegliano Prosecco Superiore Brut (£9.99) and Waitrose Blanc de Blancs Brut Champagne (£19.99) both received gold medals.

'The . calibre of wines from the supermarket own-brand ranges has been . phenomenal this year, and it is great to see them picking up top prizes . across all styles. From delicious Champagnes to tremendous Sherries, . shoppers can find some lovely wines in the aisles,' he said. 'Each . year the quality of the supermarket own-brand wines gets better and . better. Long gone are the days when you might be embarrassed to take an . own-brand wine to a dinner party. Our IWC medal stickers offer a handy . guide to picking the best wines in the aisle.' Charles . continued to say that the competition couldn't be fairer, and that . winning medals at the contest can give these supermarket brands a real . boost. 'The .

By hosting two separate tasting events . across the year, wines are given the best chance to perform well, . wherever they're from.

"By . Martha Cliff . The stars consider Matt Roberts the crème de la crème of fitness trainers. His high profile clients include those of the fashion world (Naomi Campbell, Tom Ford and John Galliano), singers (Natalie Imbruglia) and stars of the small screen (Amanda Holden), not to mention an unnamed royal. He has even helped to shape up the country's political minds with David Cameron (and his wife Samantha) being loyal clients. Celebrity trainer - Matt Roberts - has launched a new affordable gym range for Argos . While not everyone may be able to afford access to Matt's personal expertise, he believes that's no excuse not to get fit. He has extended his at-home gym range at Argos - having already sold over 109,000 products in the first year of trading - so people can gain fitness equipment they can use at home at affordable prices, starting at £7.99 for a skipping rope. The range is the latest addition in his fitness empire which includes five of his own gyms, a store in London's Mayfair, several fitness retreats and a collection of supplements. Matt has helped both David Cameron and his wife, Samantha, to get into shape . The lower prices are reflective of . Matt's objective behind the launch - to make fitness available to all - as . he said he is tired of hearing people's excuses on why they don't . exercise. Whether that's being too poor, too busy or just too lazy. He told the Express that you have no one to blame but yourself if you are unhappy with your fitness. 'Well if you don't exercise congratulations on losing seven years of your life. There isn't a choice and there are no excuses. You are decreasing the quality of your life. 'You need to make time. It takes 15 to 20 minutes of vigorous work, three to four days a week. That is enough.' For Matt no excuses mean no excuses, as he even claims that new mothers should make time to exercise. Other clients of Matt have included comedian Michael McIntyre . 'Exercise whenever and wherever you . can - for short bursts of time - is fantastic for your metabolism. Many . of my clients are busy mums and they only have 15 minutes to spare, . which is enough to get results,' says Matt, who famously got Sam Cam . back into shape after the birth of her daughter, Florence. He says that exercising can easily be incorporated into any daily routine; you just have to be inventive. 'Briskly pushing a pram, doing a ten to 15-minute set of lunges, squats and tricep dips while you're running a bath, or a short, fast sprint on a spin bike will get results, so don't think you have to spend hours exercising to lose weight.' For Matt the body young girls should be aspiring towards is Jennifer Lawrence . His new gym range includes everything from the classic dumbbell to a very swish treadmill with bluetooth. However, Matt is insistent that the simplest of equipment - like a skipping rope - can be all it takes to get to start getting fit. Matt may have trained some rather impressive British stars but when it comes to a fitness role model, he believes Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence makes a great idol for young women. 'She’s a great advert for females,' he told the Express. 'She’s not your traditional, pencil-thin Hollywood actress. She's got curves but she's not overweight. She's in great shape.' He added that we shouldn't be deterred by celebrities and that their body shapes aren't unattainable. 'All bodies are just bodies. They all go through the same process. What makes someone a celebrity is not just the body, it's the person. You can achieve the same as they can. You have to focus on what you can become, what you want to become and take great pride in that.' Argos Buyer, Chris Billingham, said: 'The products are a great addition and a natural evolution of the range given the success we have seen. Introducing technology into the products also feeds customers desire for data and a more interactive user experience. 'It’s fantastic, on the treadmill one day you could be running around the streets of San Francisco and the next running around the Colosseum in Rome. Education is important and Matt's been fantastic to work with throughout landing the project and is really helping to aid the customers into how they can get the best out of their equipment.'","Matt Roberts has released fitness products at affordable prices .

The work-outs were really energetic cardio programs . and, if I'm  honest, my fitness levels were pretty poor and at first I . could only manage 45 minutes, but over time I was doing a full hour.' Binky hit her goal weight within six weeks and was so pleased with the result she was happy to pose for a revealing set of pictures for her 2015 Signature Calender shoot, wearing a skin-tight leopardprint catsuit. Binky lost a stone and dropped a dress size in six weeks . Binky said that she would never had felt confident enough to have posed like that had she not reached her goal weight. 'I've never felt better and it was great to see my super-flat tummy in the after shoots. I also felt super-sensual in those gorgeous designer outfits for the calendar shoot. 'It's all due to my new health regime. For the first time in my life, I feel really confident about showing off my body.' You can read the full story of Binky's incredible weight loss in this week's Now magazine . So what's her secret? Binky says that along with severe determination (and perspiration), using Forza Raspberry K2 diet supplements also helped to speed the process along, especially when she was busy filming. 'I'd usually do my work outs at about 8am before I went to filming for Made In Chelsea and I would take one or two tablets of Forza Raspberry K2. 'They would give me an energy boost to build up the inclination to start the work-out session as well as helping with fat-burning. 'There is no way I could have done this . shoot if I hadn't done the work-outs and been using the Forza Raspberry . K2. I just wouldn't have felt confident enough to be pictured in this . way.' Forza Supplements managing director Lee . Smith was quick to compliment the star on her new shape. 'Binky looks really slinky - we are thrilled out how quickly . she has got in shape' he says. Binky herself says: 'Over the first few days, the results were amazing. I lost just over four pounds in four days. 'By the . third week I had lost about eight pounds and I could really start to see . a difference, which really gave me more enthusiasm to press on to my . target weight of just over nine stone. 'By then I was losing about two pounds a week and I could really start to see myself getting more and more toned. 'I . hit my target weight of 9st 2lbs a week before the . calendar shoot. It really gave me confidence knowing that I'd worked . hard and was in the best shape possible.' In typical down-to-earth Binky style, she admits that it wasn't a walk in the park and she did have days when she didn't stick to the diet. 'I did have a few days when I fell off the wagon. Drinking wine is my worst failing when it comes to losing weight and also I do love my food, especially take-away curries. Chicken Jalfrezi with sag aloo is my favourite, but I cut this treat down to every other week. 'I stopped the late-night kebab pitstops too. I also cut down on my drinking and would only have Skinny Bitches - vodka, fresh lime and soda.' Read the full story of Binky's incredible . weight-loss in this week's NOW Magazine .

The devastated aunt of the five-year-old boy who who was swept into the sea on the NSW Central Coast on Thursday has revealed the family's heartbreak as he is feared to be drowned. Wella Kupu begged for her 'sweet' nephew Chayce Kofe to be brought home safely as the full-scale search for him turned into a recovery operation at Pearl Beach on Friday. 'Heading to Umina to be with my family... may the lord give us strength today and bring our Little Chayce home to us,' she wrote on Facebook. Ms Kupu posted photos of Chayce on her page as tributes poured in for the young boy who has been missing since 1.50pm pm on Thursday. The boy, believed to be from the Central Coast but holidaying at the beachside village with his family, was playing on the shore with his siblings when a large wave swept him into the ocean. A frantic search failed to find him on Thursday after he vanished. On Thursday evening Ms Kupe wrote: 'Devastated to loose my little nephew today ... we will find Chayce ... Loving you always Aunty Wella.' Another post read: 'Devastating news for our family today...the passing of our nephew Chayce Kofe....Where there are no words know the silence are carrying the thoughts and prayers of all who love you Chayce.' A massive sea and air search at Pearl Beach on the Central coast to find the missing five-year-old boy turned to a recovery operation on Friday . 'I may have only held you in my arms for a moment.....But i will HOLD you im my heart forever Chayce... Loving you always [sic],' she added. Detective Superintendent Mark Hutchings said on Friday the search had turned into a recovery operation. 'We always hold out some hope but my experience tells me that we have been going for some time and unfortunately I think we are in the recovery stage,' the Marine Area Commander told reporters.

Detective Superintendent Mark Hutchings said on Friday the search had turned into a recovery operation . Police officers and rescuers pictured standing on the beach as the search first began on Friday morning . 'It feels like a tragedy for the community.' It is understood that most of the family were not confident in the water. Surf lifesavers told Fairfax Media the boy's family might not have been able to save him. 'They're not sure whether anybody could actually swim,' a spokeswoman for Surf Life Saving NSW said. Acting Superintendent Paul Nicholls said the young boy, who was staying with extended family in a house opposite the beach, was with a group of family and friends, including children, at the time of the incident. Acting Superintendent Nicholls said friends and family tried unsuccessfully to grab the boy but were unable to reach him. The boy's family have arrived on the beach are being comforted by police and counsellors . A full scale search resumed on Friday morning as soon as it was light . A command post had been set up and was manned overnight on Thursday . 'We understand that some of the people that he was with have gone into the water to go and assist but they were unable to locate him,' he told the ABC. Locals have turned up at the beach offering to help the grief-stricken family. Resident Mandy Harris told AAP the waves were very dangerous when the boy was swept into the ocean. 'They were the biggest I have ever seen and I have lived here for eight years,' she said. 'The trouble is there is a lot of undertows in the ocean.' Pearl Beach general store owner Kevin McCunn said the suspected drowning is a real tragedy for the tight-knit, beachside community. The boy was holidaying at the beachside village with his family . Brisbane Water Local Area Command, the Marine Area Command and Surf Life Saving Australia all took to the waters . He said the northern end of the beach, where the young boy was playing, was a dangerous spot. 'It's been rough seas the last few days and at the north end of the beach it can be quite dangerous,' he said. A resident told the Sydney Morning Herald a young boy was the last person to spot the child in the surf. 'The child was only spotted once [in the surf], I believe, and he was actually playing at the north end of the beach and that’s the rough end,' she said. The resident, who did not want to be named, also claimed the five-year-old was playing with siblings. A full scale air and sea search was immediately conducted involving police from Brisbane Water Local Area Command, the Marine Area Command, Surf Life Saving Australia, NSW Ambulance Service and the Westpac Life Saver Helicopter and the sea search continued overnight after the light faded. Surf lifesavers told Fairfax Media the boy's family might not have been able to save him . A frantic search failed to find the boy on Thursday . A NSW police spokesperson told MailOnline on Friday morning: 'The search has resumed but there is unfortunately nothing new.' Marine Area Command officers continued the search throughout Thursday night with the assistance of the Police Rescue Squad officers. 'Because of the darkness a lot of the resources can't be used,' a police spokesman said. Dye had been released into the water during the search in order to determine the direction of the currents. A nearby restaurant owner said people on the beach were 'totally beside themselves' after hearing the news. 'We all feel sick to our stomach, we are worried about the poor parents,' Melissa, from Pearls on the Beach restaurant told TVNZ. 'It's quite rough out there.' The picturesque coastal hamlet has been a popular destination with school holidays taking place over the past week. However the beach is not patrolled.

"By . Hannah Roberts . His father's death during the Second World War has tormented Roger Waters his entire life, serving as the inspiration for the timeless album The Wall. The Pink Floyd legend was just a five month old baby when Eric Waters Fletcher perished during the 1944 Italy landings. His remains were never found. Now the rock star has revealed that his lifelong journey to come to terms with his father’s fate ‘has finally come to the end’. Tribute: Roger Waters touches the monument erected in memory of his father, Eroc Fletcher, in the village of Anzio, south of Rome . Graveside: Roger Waters of Pink Floyd visits a cemetery in Cassino, Italy, as he makes an emotional journey to visit the battlefield where his father was killed along with thousands of other Allied troops . A war diary belonging to Pink Floyd star Roger Waters' father has been uncovered by a fellow soldier (pictured) the Waters family while father Eric was serving in the Royal Fusiliers . 70 years later, to the day, Waters has established a monument to the heroic sacrifice of the father he never knew, giving him finally a place to mourn. Second Lieutenant Waters died on 18th February 1944 while serving with the Royal Fusiliers as they advanced through Italy in one of the most bitterly fought campaigns of the entire war. The 31-year-old from Cambridge was killed during the initial wave of fighting as the Allies attempted to take the beachhead at Anzio, south of Rome. Allied forces suffered 43,000 casualties before they took the medieval monastery of Montecasino and eventually Rome. Scarred: The bass-guitarist has spent his life struggling to come to terms with his father's death . The pain Waters felt at never knowing his father inspired several Pink Floyd songs and is associated in particular with When The Tigers Broke Free. The film and album The Wall tell the story of a troubled musician called Pink left scarred by the death of his father in World War II. Yesterday the singer laid wreaths as he unveiled the monument at the Roselli Institute in the Italian town of Aprilia, south of Rome, near the site of Lt Waters death. The rock musician told how his conscientious objector father, working as an ambulance driver, had signed up for a commission in 1943 after becoming convinced that it was ‘a necessary war’. Emotional: The film and album The Wall tells the story of how a troubled rock star called Pink, who is said to be Waters, is left psychologically scarred by the loss of his father in the war . The famously pacifist Waters said: ‘I learnt from my father the example of standing by your principles and beliefs. ‘He thought he was fighting a necessary fight against the Nazis. I think he was too. He paid the ultimate price.’ Signing up, he explained, ‘cost my father his life but secured for him a place among all the other heroes who stand up for what they know to be right.’ The lead singer only learnt for the first time last year how his father died after a veteran soldier read about his visit to the Commonwealth Grave Cemetery at Montecassino. Anzio veteran Harry Schindler unearthed dispatches and maps that enabled him to pinpoint the exact spot where Lieutenant Waters died. According to the documents, from the National Archives in Kew, Waters’ company tried to advance on a heavily defended German position. Fierce fighting from the British initially led the enemy to withdraw. But moving dispatches on the final day read: 'Further attack on Z coy. This time in greater strength than previous attack.' An hour later it reads: 'Z coy reported enemy all round their positions, very stiff fighting going on.' At 11.30am the final report reads: 'Lt Waters killed and Lt Hill wounded, situation now critical.' Yesterday Mr Schindler, 93, who also attended the ceremony, said that the plinth is ‘a monument to a young boy growing up without knowing his father’. He said: ‘Roger has it all now. I hope for him to open a new chapter, that the waters, so to speak, are calmer. This wall at least is down.’","Eric Waters Fletcher was killed during at a beachhead in Anzio in WWII .

"By . Leesa Smith . A homeless man who allegedly raped and killed a Chinese woman in Melbourne has been described as an 'average Aussie bloke’ by a stranger who bought him a drink just hours beforehand. The white collar worker, who requested not to be named, happened to meet Scott Allen Miller before he allegedly sexually assaulted and murdered pastry chef Renea Lau, 32, in Kings Domain on Saturday morning. The stranger told The Age that Miller, 42, approached him in Federation Square earlier that morning to ask where he should go for a drink and when the man told him that he was going to the Carlton Club, Miller began to walk with him. ‘He did appear like your average Aussie bloke,’ he said. ‘As we were walking there he told me how he was sleeping rough on the street and I felt a bit sorry for him.’ Scroll down for video . The anonymous white collar worker was approached by Scott Allen Miller in Federation Square just hours before he allegedly raped and killed Renea Lau . He described Miller as ‘articulate and friendly’ and thought he was a ‘very highly functioning homeless person’ who bought most of his own drinks at the bar. But the office worker said about an hour after he bought Miller a beer, he became ‘weirded out’ by the conversation. Police reported that Miller had been ejected from the Carlton Club hotel on Bourke Street about half an hour earlier before allegedly chased down Ms Lau. Yuk Ling Lau (left) has been remembered as a 'wonderful person' by her friends . Meanwhile Miller, 42, remained alert in the dock during a brief hearing at Melbourne Magistrates Court on Wednesday where he stands accused of killing Chinese national Yuk Ling Lau while she was on her way to work. Miller, who had been living on the streets for two months, looked bewildered and yawned several times during the short hearing, the Herald Sun reports. Legal Aid solicitor Sarah Pratt told the court that Miller had suffered a previous drug-induced psychosis and required a prison health assessment. 'It’s his first time in custody,' Ms Pratt said. Scott Allen Miller has appeared in court in Melbourne charged over the rape and murder of Yuk Ling Lau . A police application to retain forensic samples taken from Miller was granted and he was remanded to reappear in Melbourne Magistrates Court on October 24. Ms Lau, a 32-year-old pastry chef from Hong Kong, was found dead by joggers in Kings Domain on Sunday morning at 5.30am. Miller was arrested near Eden on the NSW far south coast on Monday following a three-day manhunt. He was extradited to Victoria on Tuesday and was charged in Melbourne that night. Ms Lau's friends, who knew her as Renea, remembered her as a 'beautiful friend and colleague' and a large group of them attended the hearing on Wednesday. A colleague who worked with Ms Lau at the dessert bar in Melbourne's inner-east, Steven Kearney, said she was a 'wonderful person'. 'I would just like to state with deep sadness that Renea was an employee,' Mr Kearney told The Age. 'She will be terribly missed here. She was... a beautiful friend and colleague. We offer our heartfelt condolences to her family and friends and all our thoughts are with them.' Mr Kearney asked the media to respect his and his other colleagues' privacy as they were 'grieving and working through this difficult time'. Yuk LIng Lau (pink top) was on her way to work in Melbourne when she was raped and murdered . Ms Lau had moved to Australia in 2012. Her family will arrive in Australia later this week to formally identify her body. Homicide Squad Detective Inspector John Potter confirmed on Monday that Ms Lau had been sexually assaulted before she died. 'This is a particularly violent assault on this woman, she has been sexually assaulted and she has been physically assaulted,' Insp Potter said. Miller was arrested by an off-duty police officer near Eden, while camping in a small cove area and was later taken to a police station. Yuk Ling Lau's parents are due to arrive from Hong Kong this week to take their daughter's body home . He was born in the US and once lived in an affluent Perth suburb. In the 1990s, he was a leading figure in the illegal dance party scene in Perth as director of E-Nerve Pty Ltd a company that organised raves, The Age reported. Scott Allen Miller is led into court in Melbourne on Wednesday charged over the rape and murder of Yuk Ling Lau . Her body was discovered by joggers on Saturday morning under a tree in the popular park . Police have not released the woman's name, but say she is a Chinese national who was in her 30s .

"By . Leesa Smith . Going back to school has never been so luxurious as a first home buyer snaps up a converted old classroom in South Melbourne for $1.28 million on Saturday. The tri-level, three-bedroom, four-bathroom apartment is spread more than 200 square metres and is nestled behind the walls of the former Dorcas Street Primary School which was built in 1880. The New York-style loft at 13/284 Dorcas Street includes a marble open fire, a Juliette balcony and each large bedroom has an ensuite - one with a sauna and another with sunken spa. The apartment is just one of the converted classrooms in the heritage-listed building which was originally constructed from a design by architect Charles Webb, as a result of winning a competition, with the intention to accommodate more than 1000 students. Only minor additions were made to the rear of the building to provide a caretaker's residence, cloak room and store in 1924 until the school closed at the end of the school year in 1996. The building is historically important as a representative example of the first group of large schools constructed in Victoria after the Education Act of 1872. The expansion of Victoria's education system put tremendous pressure on authorities who had to cater for a very large number of children. As a result of this development, there was an enormous increase in the number of schools constructed between 1874 and 1875. This move illustrated Victoria's confidence and prosperity in the years following the goldrushes when working class children of the inner suburbs were provided with elaborately designed and spacious schools, similar to private schools built for the wealthy.

"By . Hannah Roberts . A young couple allegedly strangled their flatmate, and transported her body 250 miles in a suitcase to Venice lagoon, after she refused their sexual advances. The naked body of 29-year-old Mahtab Savoji, an Iranian who was studying costume design in Milan, was found in luggage floating near the Venetian Lido last week. Indian couple Gagandeep Kaur, 30 and Rajeshwar Singh 28, who shared a room with the Iranian in Milan, have now been arrested in connection with the murder. The body of Mahtab Savoji, 29, was found dumped in a suitcase floating in a Venice lagoon. The Iranian was studying costume design in Milan . The woman's two flat mates Gagandeep Kaur, 30 and Rajeshwar Singh 28, have been arrested in connection to the death . Miss Kaur, a waitress and Mr Singh, a hotel porter, deny murdering the fashion student, but claim they panicked and hid the body after finding her dead last Monday morning, after she had drunk a lot of whisky the night before. The hotel workers allegedly dumped the body during an extraordinary 20-hour, 400 mile round trip to Venice riding on on three trains and a vaporetto with the suitcase. Alessandro Giuliano, head of Milan's top crime squad, said that the flatmates had quickly come under suspicion because of their contradictory accounts. The pair claim they found the student's body and panicked - putting it in a suitcase and taking it on a 400-mile trip to Venice . Initially they said they had seen her alive on Monday morning, he said. ‘Then they said they found her in her room dead, panicked and put her in a suitcase. ‘They first tried to dispose of the body in Lake Como, in Lecco, but were unable to do so because there were people around. ‘So they took a train back to Milan took the train to Venice then a vaporetto to the Lido where they certainly abandoned the body.’ They were captured on CCTV arriving in Venice with the suitcase, police say, discarding the body before taking a Euro 500 taxi ride back to Milan. Police are working on the theory that the murder was the result of the student rejecting unwelcome sexual approaches by the couple. Mr Singh had allegedly made sexual advances to Miss Savoji previously and she was due to move out on the day she was found dead, having told friends she was not getting along with her roommates. The body surfaced within hours of its disposal, but took police six days to identify. A postmortem revealed that Miss Savoji died of asphyxiation. There was no water in her lungs signalling to investigators that the University of Brera student must have been killed before she arrived in the canal.","Naked body of Mahtab Savoki, 29, found in a suitcase floating in a lagoon .

"By . Hannah Roberts . Sayeed Warsi said Christians were often 'scapegoated' for events that take place thousands of miles away . Britain's most senior Muslim politician, Sayeeda Warsi, has warned that the persecution of Christians has become ‘a global crisis’. Minister for Faith Baroness Warsi described ‘a rising tide’ in attacks on Christians in the war-torn regions of Egypt, Iraq and Syria where they often become ‘scapegoats’ for events taking place thousands of miles away. Warsi, a mother of five and the daughter of Pakistani immigrants, pointed out that Christian minorities are threatened by Muslim majorities in the very places that gave rise to Christianity. In an open letter to L’Osservatore Romano, the official Vatican newspaper, she wrote: ‘The bitterest irony of this persecution - ostracism, discrimination, abuse, forced conversion, torture and even murder - is that it is taking place in a region where Christianity has its roots. ‘Sometimes these cases are examples of collective punishment: people lashing out at Christian minorities in response to events happening many miles away. 'Other times, a Christian is just a convenient ‘other’ - a scapegoat.’ ‘The threat to religious freedom, I believe, has become a global crisis.’ The number of Christians killed for their faith around the world doubled in 2013. The senior Tory said that majority Muslim communities have a duty to defend Christian minorities. She said: ‘History teaches us that we have only defeated intolerance and hatred when we have all come together, whatever the cause. The majority communities need to defend the minorities.’ The peer, who is also a Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister of State, said that ‘the government has elevated (religious discrimination against Christians and other minorities) to a key priority in the government’s human rights work.’ An estimated 100 million Christians around the world suffered persecution for their faith in 2013. Failing states with civil wars or persistent tensions such Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen were often the most dangerous for Christians. There was now ‘a strong drive to purge Christianity from Somalia’, a report by non-denominational group Open Doors USA who compiled a list of the worst countries said. The majority of anti-Christian persecution in the world in 2013 took place at the hands of radical Muslims, according to the report, both in Islamic countries such as Somalia, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Maldives, Pakistan, Iran and Yemen and in non-Muslim countries such as Kenya and Tanzania. A victim of a suicide bomb which exploded at a Christian church in Peshawar, Pakistan, in September . In Syria, 1213 Christians were killed last year, more than the global total in 2012. Atrocities against the Christian minority who make up 10 per cent of the population have been getting more frequent since the war began almost three years ago, perpetrated especially by jihadi groups. In Pakistan– a suicide bombing at a Peshawar church last autumn killed 89 in the country’s deadliest single attack targeting Christians so far. There is also increasing violence against Christians in Africa. 612 Christians were killed for their faith in Nigeria last year. Elsewhere, Sri Lanka saw more than 50 attacks on churches last year alone, powered by a strident Buddhist nationalist movement . Killings are only the most extreme examples of persecutions. Christians, the world’s largest persecuted minority also face attacks on churches and schools, discrimination, threats, sexual assaults and expulsion from countries.","Sayeeda Warsi described a 'rising tide' in attacks against Christians .

"By . Ashley Collman . and Hannah Roberts . Raffaele Sollecito last night suggested his relationship with Amanda Knox was the only reason he was found guilty of murdering British student Meredith Kercher. The 29-year-old spoke out to Anderson Cooper after an Italian court's decision to reinstate his conviction in the 2007 murder and appeared to imply that Knox’s unpopularity in Italy meant he was doomed to be found guilty again. 'I'm guilty just because in their minds I have to be guilty because I was her boyfriend. It doesn't make any sense to me,' he said on CNN. Scroll down for video . Guilty by association: Amanda Knox's Italian ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito appeared on CNN from Italy Monday night following a new decision to reinstate his 25 year prison sentence for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher . Sollecito and Knox were originally sentenced to 25 and 28 years in prison, respectively, and served four years before being released in 2011. Upon her release Knox went back to her home in Seattle, Washington and when the case went into retrial last year, she refused to return to Italy. Diplomats have said no Secretary of State would ever extradict Knox back to Italy, but Italian Sollecito has attended the whole re-trial knowing there was a real threat he could be sent back to prison. 'I'm trying to be as positive as possible in a situation like this,' he said. 'It's very traumatic, the situation here now. But on the other side, I still have to fight. I have chosen to be here and to fight against this ordeal.' Misunderstanding: Raffaele dismissed reports he was trying to flee Italy this morning and claimed he was actually returning to the country after hearing the guilty verdict . Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of Meredith Kercher, pictured . 'I don't know what to think, because . objectively, there's nothing against me and nothing very strong against . Amanda,' Sollecito added. Sollecito's sentence will not be imposed until the Italian Supreme Court confirms it at a hearing next year. The . day after the guilty verdict was announced, it seemed as though . Sollecito was trying to flee the country when he was arrested 40 . kilometers from the Austrian border at a hotel in the Italian village of . Venzone. But he told CNN . that he went to Austria to celebrate the decision with his girlfriend, . since he expected to be cleared of all charges and drove back into Italy . 'as soon as I understood the verdict.' Police apprehended Raffaele Sollecito, pictured left, and his girlfriend - believed to be Greta Menegaldo, pictured right - at a hotel approximately 40 kilometres from the Italian border . Both Raffaele Sollecito and his girlfriend cover up their faces as they leave Udine police station in Italy.

Swarm: Sollecito, driving the Mini, was found by police near Italy's border with Slovenia and Austria . Raffaele Sollecito was apprehended by police at a hotel in Venzone, in between Tarvision and Udine, north-east Italy, which are close to both the borders of Austria and Slovenia . The Carnia hotel in Venzone, Italy, where police are believed to have found Sollecito with his girlfriend . A typical room inside the Hotel Carnia, pictured, where the couple were staying after Sollecito discovered judges had found him guilty of the murder of Meredith Kercher . On . Thursday – the day of  the verdict – he left the court at 10:30am as . the panel of judges went out to consider their decision. By the time they returned to announce the verdict, Sollecito was nowhere to be seen. His lawyer claimed he was still in Florence, but ‘too stressed’ to attend. While both Sollecito and Knox were re-convicted of Kercher's murder last week, neither will be forced to serve time until the sentence is confirmed by an Italian Supreme Court. Both parties are appealing the guilty verdict, and will remain free in the meantime. Their case will again be heard in front of Italy's highest court, the court of cassation, which ordered the retrial earlier last year. The high court will be able to overturn the guilty verdict if it finds errors in the law were made by the lower court. Both parties may have an advantage in their next hearing, following a misstep on the part of the presiding judge in the most recent case. Judge Alessandro Nencini gave interviews to three Italian newspapers, commenting on the case just a few days before giving out her final decision. In one interview, Nencini said Sollecito may have made a mistake by not testifying in the trial. However, Sollecito's lawyers point out that he was never asked to submit to a cross examination. They add that Nencini's public comments show bias and taint the verdict. 'The conviction is the result of a clear bias on the part of the judges against the defendants and in particular against Raffaele Sollecito, and that interview proves it,' his defense lawyer Luca Maori told Corriere della Sera. In . fact he and his girlfriend Greta Menegaldo, a 23-year-old model, were . already on their way to Italy’s north-east border with Austria. The pair had met while studying at the University of Verona and are said to have become close. Miss . Menegaldo, who is  from Treviso, near Venice, has previously . accompanied Sollecito on a holiday to South America, where her parents . now live. A Mini Cooper belonging to her father was spotted heading to . the Italian-Austrian border on Thursday while the judges were . deliberating the case of Sollecito and Knox. The car was already 200 miles from Florence. Staff at the low-key Carnia hotel tipped off the police, after recognising Sollecito as he checked in at 1am. At . dawn he was taken to a police station in Udine where his passport was . confiscated. He has been cautioned that  he is forbidden to leave the . country,’ a spokesman for the police said. ‘His passport has been  taken away from him and his identity card has been stamped to show that he must not leave Italy.’ Sollecito . told police he went on ‘a little trip into Austria, then came back to . Italy’. According to reports in the Italian media, he added: ‘I stopped . there to rest.’ He later released a statement saying he had ‘never . thought of fleeing, before or now’. Sollecito’s lawyer, Luca Maori, said his client had gone ‘willingly’ with police to give up his passport. The . Florence court had ruled that there was a ‘real and present’ danger . that Sollecito would flee the country and said he could not leave Italy . again without permission  from a judge. The . judges said that although he had been present at some of the trial, . Sollecito had shown an interest in obtaining ‘logistical support in . countries with which Italy does not have relations of [mutual] judicial . assistance’. In addition to holidaying in the Dominican Republic earlier in the case, Sollecito sought work in Switzerland. But he was forced to leave when the authorities discovered his legal obligations.

"By . Leesa Smith . Two nursing home patients died from fatal doses of insulin and another was left hospitalised after complaints were made about a staff member, police have alleged. Marie Darragh, 82, and Isobella Spencer 77, were found unconscious in their beds and died a short time last in their Ballina nursing home in northern NSW in May. Police allege a 46-year-old nurse from the St Andrews Village Aged Cared facility administered the insulin to Ms Darragh and Ms Spencer in the middle of the night. The nurse was arrested in Seaspray in Victoria on Monday and is expected to arrive in Sydney on Tuesday night with homicide detectives, to be charged with the two alleged murders, as well as the assault of an 88-year-old woman. The 88-year-old resident was allegedly woken in the middle of the night to find the nurse trying to give her 'unscheduled medication'. Scroll down for video . Marie Darragh, 82, was one of two women found unconscious in their beds on May 10 by staff at St Andrews Village nursing home in Ballina . Homicide squad boss Detective Superintendent Mick Willing said the nurse would be charged with two counts of murder and assault. 'We are alleging two of the three victims made complaints about the 46-year-old during the course of her employment,' he said. It is understood one of the women who died, and the 88-year-old were behind the complaints. Det Supt Willing said the nurse was on registered days off after the deaths and then handed in her registration when she allegedly fled to Victoria, where she used to live. 'The woman, following the deaths of the two elderly residents, left the nursing home on her own accord and moved to Seaspray,' Det Supt Willing said. The Melbourne Magistrates Court, where the nurse appeared on Tuesday to be extradited to NSW, heard she had never been in police custody before and was taking medication for severe depression. Following the arrest, St Andrews Aged Care CEO Pip Carter said the news was devastating. 'I want to reassure residents and the community that the safety and care of St Andrews' residents always has been and always will be a priority,' she said. In June, MailOnline reported that police confirmed they were 'looking at the actions of all nursing home staff' in relation to the deaths and are examining what medications the elderly residents were given. Ms Darragh, who was on the brink of death when she moved to the Ballina nursing home three years ago, managed to turn her health around after she quit smoking. Ms Darragh's daughter, Charli Matterson, told the ABC her mum had lived at the home for three years and was healthy at the time she died . Her daughter, Janet Parkinson, said her mother's new-found health and happiness made the suspected murder so much harder to deal with. 'It's total heartbreak,' Ms Parkinson said on Thursday. 'Because when she went in there she was ready to die. She was so frail and it has taken them three and a half years to get her where she was. 'They built her up and she had to go this way ... that's the heartbreaking thing.' The women were pronounced dead before paramedics arrived just before Mother's Day. A third elderly woman at the nursing home was attacked on the same night but survived. She is understood to be helping police with their investigation and her name has not been released. The nursing home said she is in good health and is back at the facility after a stint in hospital. Detectives believe they have a good idea how both women died and have questioned nursing home staff. 'Obviously we are looking at the actions of staff members that night. However, we are keeping an open mind,' Detective Superintendent Mick Willing said. 'The fact that these deaths occurred in unexpected circumstances on the same night, in the same location, prompted an immediate response from homicide investigators. 'There is nothing to suggest the women's deaths are in any way linked to deaths in other nursing homes.' Ms Darragh was a grandmother to 11 and mother of three including Charli Matterson . Police arrested a 46-year-old woman who was a nurse at St Andrews Village nursing home in Ballina, northern NSW . Det Supt said the management and staff at St Andrews Village nursing home had been very supportive of the detectives managing the case. Ms Parkinson said she had her own suspicions about what happened, but could not speak highly enough of the nursing home staff. 'Obviously I have missed something,' she said. Ms Darragh, a grandmother to 11 and mother of three, had 'loved' living at the nursing home, according to her daughter. The manager of the nursing home, Phillip Carter, said that the cause of the women's deaths was still unknown but that the deaths have 'deeply distressed staff, residents and their families'. 'The police have advised me they do not have conclusive information on the causes of death at this stage,' he said. 'St Andrews acted immediately to involve the police because the deaths were unexpected. 'We understand the pain of losing a loved one and we are doing all we can to assist police.' He also said he knew nothing about the assault on the third woman. 'All I've been told is there's an investigation because of two unexpected deaths. They haven't consulted with me about anyone else being assaulted or tampered with,' he told MailOnline. Police did not disclose any further details about the women's deaths but said there was no 'existing threat' at the nursing home .","Two nursing home patients died from fatal doses of insulin and another was left hospitalised after complaints were made about a staff member .

"By . Hannah Roberts . Monsignor Nunzio Scarano, the Vatican prelate accused of trying to smuggle 20 million euros into Italy on an airforce jet, is facing fresh legal woes after he was issued with another arrest warrant. The former bishop of Salerno, nicknamed ‘Monsignor 500 Euros’, after his favourite bank note, is now accused of laundering millions of euros through the Vatican bank by disguising it as charitable donations. Another priest has been put under house arrest as part of the investigation, and a notary has been suspended. Scarano allegedly gave his clients cash from the Vatican bank in exchange for cheques marked as charitable donations and a certificate of donation from the church . Until his arrest in June last year Scarano was chief accountant for the Vatican's property portfolio. He denies charges that he conspired with a former Italian secret service agent and a financial broker in a failed bid to bring the cash from Switzerland to Italy in a military plane, avoiding customs. Investigators yesterday ordered the seizure of assets, and froze bank accounts with a combined value of six million euros. Financial police in the southern city of Salerno said that Scarano's Vatican bank accounts had been used to transfer millions of euros in fictitious donations from offshore companies. The Vatican bank, formerly known as the Institute for Religious Operas, . IOR, and Monsignor Nunzio Scarano, who used to be the chief . accountant for the Vatican's property portfolio . Scarano allegedly gave his clients cash from the Vatican bank in exchange for cheques marked as charitable donations and a certificate of donation from the church. But his lawyer has said his client was merely taking money from donors who thought they were funding a home for the terminally ill. Silverio Sica said: 'We continue to strongly maintain the good faith of Don Nunzio Scarano and his absolute certainty that the money came from legitimate donations.' Some of the cheques were allegedly made out for as much as half a million euros. His clients included doctors, lawyers, architects and businessmen, according to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. The scandal-hit Vatican Bank, officially known as the Institute for Religious Works (IOR), has been tarnished by scandal for 30 years. 'Hurt': Pope Francis is upset about the Scarano case . Pope Francis has said he was ‘hurt’ by the Scarano case last year, the latest in a series that have cast a cloud of suspicion over financial dealings at ‘God’ s bank’. The Pope has made a number of reforms to introduce greater financial transparency and fight money laundering at the IOR. In December the Council of Europe's Moneyval agency, a monitoring group of financial experts, praised the Vatican's progress, as it seeks to get on the 'white list' of countries with strong credentials on combatting financial crime. Last week Francis sacked all but one member of a commission appointed by Benedict to oversee the bank.

"By . Hannah Roberts . Tormented relatives of Meredith Kercher yesterday said they feared their quest for justice may be thwarted by the American authorities. Meredith’s elder brother Kyle insisted Amanda Knox must be punished for her part in the 2007 murder of his sister – yet was concerned she might never be sent back to Italy. The 34-year-old warned that if the US did not extradite Knox, it could not expect other countries to return fugitives to face justice in America. Scroll down for Video . Stephanie Kercher and her brother Kyle: The siblings of murdered British student Meredith Kercher today called for her convicted murderer Amanda Knox to be returned to Italy to begin serving her 28-year sentence . Mr Kercher, who was in Florence for the ruling, said: ‘Ultimately somebody who is found guilty for murder, whoever they are, should  be punished.’ And Stephanie, Meredith’s sister, said it would be wrong for Knox or her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito to remain at liberty. Mr Kercher said: ‘Nothing will ever take away the horror of what happened to her. The best we can hope for is of course finally bringing this whole case to a conclusion.’ The American, nicknamed Foxy Knoxy, has been sentenced to 28 years in prison for the murder of the Leeds University student, who was found half naked with her throat slit in the cottage she shared with Knox in Perugia. Knox served four years but was freed on appeal in 2011 and immediately returned to the US. Murdered:  Meredith's body was discovered in her bedroom in the picturesque Umbrian university town of Perugia in November 2007 . Then this week, a court in Florence sensationally quashed that acquittal, reinstating the guilty verdict. Mr Kercher added: ‘It would set a difficult precedent if the US didn’t uphold their own laws. 'America obviously want a lot of people extradited. If America didn’t assist Italy they’re going to have problems going the other way.’ Knox has made repeated overtures to the Kercher family, writing in her multi-million pound memoir, Waiting to be Heard, that she hoped one day to meet them to assure them of her innocence. As the verdict approached, she wrote a letter to her lawyer which is addressed to Miss Kercher’s family. She told Good Morning America yesterday: ‘It’s in the mail. Mainly I just want them to know that I really understand that this is incredibly difficult, that they’ve also been on this never-ending thing and, when the case has been messed up so much, like, a verdict is no longer consolation for them.’ But the victim’s sister, Stephanie, said her family did not want to read the letter. And she ruled out a meeting, even if Knox were one day acquitted. She said: ‘It’s not something that we would want to do at the moment and I can’t say that we ever will. ‘Regardless now of a guilty or not guilty verdict, a lot has happened so it would be difficult to try and meet someone having had all that happen.’ The Kerchers have been forced to accept that they may never know what happened to Meredith, she said. She added: ‘I think we’re still on a journey to the truth. It may be we don’t ever really know what happened that night and that’s something we’ll have to come to terms with. ‘You can’t ever really get to a point where you just start to remember Meredith solely, because it is following the case, coming over to Italy and everything associated with it. ‘But the verdict has been upheld this time so we hope that... obviously, come the end of the trial, we are nearer the truth and an end so that we can just start to remember Meredith for who she was and draw a line under it.’ Meredith’s parents John and Arline had desperately wanted to be at the trial, she said, but both have health problems and were not able to travel. Amanda Knox sits alone before being interviewed on the set of ABC's ""ood Morning America yesterday, where she revealed that she had sent a letter via her lawyer to Meredith's family as the verdict approached . Knox and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito pictured days after Meredith's killing: They were sentenced to 26 and 25 years jail respectively, after Sollecito¿s DNA was found on a bra clasp belonging to Meredith . The case began in November 2007 when Meredith’s body was discovered in her bedroom in the picturesque Umbrian university town of Perugia. Knox and then boyfriend Sollecito immediately came under suspicion because of their strange behaviour. After they were seen kissing and cuddling just yards from the murder scene investigators struck upon the theory of a sex game gone wrong. They were sentenced to 26 and 25 years jail respectively, after Sollecito’s DNA was found on a bra clasp belonging to Meredith, and both girls’ DNA was found on the alleged murder weapon . But four years later the couple were freed on appeal, after court-appointed experts dismissed much of the DNA evidence linking the couple to the murder scene. Then in March last year Italy’s Supreme Court threw out their acquittal saying the appeal court judges displayed ‘a manifest lack of logic’. And on Thursday, a court in Florence dramatically ruled that the pair were guilty, sentencing them to 28 and 25 years in prison, once the Supreme Court confirms the judgement. Rudy Guede, a small time drug dealer from Ivory Coast, is serving a 16-year sentence for the murder.","Meredith Kercher's older brother and sister call for her killers to be jailed .

Its medieval hilltowns, scorched valleys and free-flowing Chianti have made Tuscany a hit with British expats and tourists.  But in recent weeks the peaceful vales have been rocked by a predatory serial killer. Eight endangered native wolves have been found dead since the beginning of November, with three fresh corpses emerging in the last week alone. In an apparently political gesture, the vigilante killer, or killers, have displayed the carcasses where they will be widely seen, in village piazzas, and, in one case, on the steps of a theatre. All but one of the protected animals . was shot, while the others were strangled.  The slaughters are thought to be the . work of an exasperated sheep farmer carrying out a personal vendetta . after attacks on his flock. Vet Marco Aloisi, director of a local wildlife recovery centre, said . that placing the wolves' bodies on public display appeared to be 'a . protest'. Wolves were reintroduced to Tuscany from the mountains of the Abruzzo in the 1990s, using EU funding. MFI furniture millionaire Paul Lister has similar plans to reintroduce . wolves to his estate in Alladale, Scotland, despite the fact that they . became extinct in the UK in the 17th century. Wolves . in Italy have been growing in numbers, as illegal hunting by farmers . has become less common, and there are now an estimated 230 in Tuscany. The . packs usually live high in the Apennine mountains, but are driven down . to farmland by cold weather or when they are unable to find enough prey. In the past two years they have ventured lower than ever before.  Wolves were responsible for 1000 attacks on sheep, cattle and horses in 2012, . according to official figures. Since then, a surge in the marauding attacks has decimated flocks in the coastal Maremma district. Growing problem: Wolves in Italy have been growing in numbers, as illegal hunting by farmers has become less common, and there are now an estimated 230 in Tuscany . Activism: Conservation groups have organised protests, calling for swift justice for those behind the killings . In some areas production has halved, bringing farmers to the brink of ruin. Regional projects to limit damage caused by wolves, including traps and specially trained dogs have largely failed. Many sympathise with the farmers' frustration. Local MP Luca Sani, chairman of the Agriculture Committee of the Lower House of Parliament, said: 'Killing wolves is a matter of great concern. However, it would be irresponsible to put our heads in the sand and not recognise that this action is a worrying sign of the exasperation felt by our farmers.' Conservation groups have organised protests, calling for swift justice. James Bottinelli, spokesman for the A law Against Vivisection group in Grosseto, said: 'Anyone who kills an animal is a criminal and must be stopped, but particularly in a case like this, where we are dealing with a serial killer.'

The Prime Minister flew to Portugal with his wife and three children on Saturday where they are enjoying a 10-day break staying in a villa. But after just a few hours in the sun, he was yesterday flown home by the Royal Squadron so he could attend the closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games. Scroll down for video . Jet-setting: David Cameron has been accused of wasting taxpayers' money after he used an RAF jet to fly back from his summer holiday in Portugal to attend the closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games . He will today use the RAF plane to fly to France and Belgium for the First World War commemorations before flying back to Portugal on a commercial flight at his own expense. The Prime Minister has been criticised for not postponing his holiday for just a few days, which would have saved taxpayers thousands of pounds. Mr Cameron’s extraordinary travel plan will see him rack up around 3,700 air miles in just three days. Labour MP Thomas Docherty said: ‘Why couldn’t he just have booked his holiday for after these events, rather than blowing thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money jetting backwards and forwards? Fellow colleague Steve Pound added: ‘It’s not like he didn’t know these events were happening - we’ve known the date of the First World War anniversary for 100 years.’ Mr Cameron, who has previously been accused of being too good at ‘chillaxing’, had an Easter break with his family in Lanzarote. He and his wife will also take their traditional break to Cornwall later this summer with their children Nancy, eight, Arthur, six, and Florence, 23 months. Last year, Mr Cameron was criticised for taking four summer holidays to Scotland, Portugal, Ibiza and Cornwall. But he argued that he checked his BlackBerry and remained in charge of the country and ready to ‘spring into action’ no matter where he was. Ed Miliband is set to spend a fortnight in the French countryside on holiday. His summer reading list is said to include a detective thriller by JK Rowling, a 1994 true-crime story set in the Deep South and a work by Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary. Meanwhile Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, has already spent a week in Spain visiting his wife Miriam’s family. He has returned to Westminster to stand in for Mr Cameron during his break, but will fly back to Spain later this month.

"By . Hannah Roberts . Survivors of the Lampedusa shipwreck were forced to strip and be sprayed with disinfectant, shocking film footage has revealed. In scenes reminiscent of World War Two concentration camps, the footage obtained by Italian television shows migrants at the detention centre on the EU’s southern-most landfall, standing naked in the open air, while waiting to be sprayed for scabies. The mayor of Lampedusa, compared treatment of migrants in the refugee centre to ‘a concentration camp, or Auschwitz’. Survivors of the Lampedusa shipwreck were forced to take their clothes off and be sprayed with disinfectant . The Lampedusa mayor compared treatment of migrants to 'a concentration camp, or Auschwitz' Minister for the interior, Angelino Alfano, has announced an investigation. Closer to Africa than mainland Europe, the island is the first port of call for many seeking a new life in Europe. Since the Arab Spring began in 2011, chaotic conditions across swathes of North Africa have allowed tens of thousands to set sail for Europe often on unseaworthy wooden boats. Many die attempting the crossing. The film shows at least two men at the detention centre standing with no clothes on, while others are undressing. One stands arms out, as a worker in overalls sprays him from head to foot. State television station RAI2 showed the video, which it said was shot by a migrant with a mobile phone, late on Monday. Minister for the Interior, Angelino Alfano, has announced an investigation after the footage emerged . It shows at least two men at the detention centre standing with no clothes on, while others are undressing . This picture shows the sunken boat resting on the bottom of the Mediterranean . The programme interviewed one of the migrants, identified only as Khalid, who said they were lined up and treated ‘like animals’. The appalling footage has emerged two months after the tragic shipwreck that claimed the lives of more than 350 migrants including many women and children. The boat, carrying mainly young Eritreans, caught fire and sank just half a mile off the coast after those aboard lit a blanket to attract attention from passing fishermen. Mayor of Lampedusa Giusi Nicolini told Rai 2 television: ‘Italy should be ashamed. The system has to change. This is not what we were hoping to see just two months after the shipwrecks which provoked so much weeping, tears, commitments and promises.’ These are the body bags of those who who drowned trying to reach Italian shores off Lampedusa . More than 330 people, including many women and children, drowned in the tragedy in October . Only about 150 of the 500 people on board are thought to have survived the shipwreck . Speaker Laura Boldrini issued an angry statement saying that ‘stripping men and women naked outside in the middle of winter’ was ‘unworthy of a civilized country’.

"By . Simon Murphy . Major security concerns have been raised after a Mail on Sunday reporter boarded a British Airways flight to London carrying five knives – bought in an air-side duty free shop – with blades longer than those used by the 9/11 hijackers. He walked unchecked on to the packed plane after buying the potentially lethal £20 Swiss Army knives at Zurich airport, Switzerland. The knives are on open sale, despite similar ones being used in a plane hijack attempt only two years ago. The startling revelation poses a massive question mark over  the disparity of security checks at airports. Blade runner: Mail on Sunday reporter Simon Murphy brandishes the lethal blades in the aeroplane toilet after smuggling them aboard the British Airways flight from Zurich, Switzerland, to London . At British airports, passengers face lengthy queues at security checkpoints. They are made to discard sharp and bladed objects, even ordinary scissors, and liquids over 100ml, including suncream. Officially, EU regulations allow passengers to travel with bladed items no longer than 6cm – the  Swiss Army knife is the same length – but an aviation security expert said people would not be able to board flights in the UK if carrying the knives. Last night, Zurich airport and British Airways insisted they were operating within EU regulations. But critics said rules that can prevent mothers carrying baby milk on board yet allow knives to be carried unchecked were putting passengers in danger. On US flights, all types of blades, including Swiss Army knives, are banned. In June, the US transport safety authority scrapped a plan to allow some small pocket knives on flights after a public outcry. Tory MP Nick de Bois said: ‘We need to change the rules. You can’t legislate for the state of mind of  the individual carrying the knife  so why put the temptation in front  of someone? A 6cm toughened blade, which you get in a Swiss Army knife, could be lethal in the wrong hands. ‘People will find it utterly incomprehensible that you can buy knives before getting on planes.’ Disparity: EU regulations allow passengers to travel with bladed items no longer than 6cm ¿ the length of the Swiss Army knives ¿ but a security expert said people would not be able to board UK flights carrying the knives . After going through security,  our reporter made two trips to the  Victorinox store, which opened in March, and purchased the knives. The shop, yards from a police room, offers an array of knives and even sells knife-sharpeners. Without even being asked for a boarding pass or passport, our reporter bought three knives on  the first visit and two more on the second. Priced between £20 and  £27, the knives did not come in protective packaging. Afterwards, our reporter simply walked through to Departures, even passing under a sign at the departure gate which showed a Swiss Army knife with a red cross over it. He then travelled on a packed BA flight to Heathrow last Wednesday – with more than 120 people on board including small children. During the flight, our reporter posed for pictures with the blade of one of the knives extended. Danger: After going through security, our reporter made two trips to the  Victorinox store, which opened in March, and purchased the knives. The shop offers an array of knives and even sells knife-sharpeners . Chris Yates, an aviation security expert, said: ‘It seems ludicrous that Leeds Bradford Airport stopped a child from carrying a toy gun on  a plane a few weeks ago because it looked threatening, when that child could have had several knives on their person for mummy and daddy to use aboard the plane. There is wide disparity with what goes on at airports. If someone turned up at  Heathrow with these knives, there’d be some pretty stiff questions  and the likelihood is those items would either be confiscated or put into the hold.’ Mr Yates said that since the 9/11 attacks, the door from the passenger cabin to the flight deck are locked but occasionally opened to provide refreshments to the crew. He explained: ‘If you’re sitting in the front, you can see when that door is open and it doesn’t take an Einstein to work out you can be through there in a few seconds with a knife out.’ In April 2011, Kazakh diplomat Valery . Tolmachev tried to hijack a flight from Paris to Rome. The 131 . passengers on the Alitalia flight looked on in terror as Tolmachev held a . Swiss Army knife to the throat of a female air stewardess, demanding to . divert to Tripoli. Disaster . was averted only after flight attendants and passengers overpowered the . hijacker. The 9/11 hijackers used box cutters which can have blades . shorter than Swiss Army knives. Multi-purpose: Victorinox Swiss Army penknives are armed with an array of potentially lethal blades . A BA spokesman said: ‘Security regulations are set by government bodies such as the European Union. We abide by such regulations.’ A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘We are assured  by Swiss authorities that all pocket knives sold at their airports comply with existing rules, which allow knives with short blades, of 6cm or less, to be carried in hand luggage.’ A Zurich airport spokeswoman said: ‘Swiss Army knives with a blade of 6cm or less are allowed. ‘It doesn’t matter if you buy the knife or knives before or after the security checkpoint, neither does the quantity, as long as the blade is 6cm or less in length.’","Penknives are on open sale in duty-free section at Swiss airport .

The fairy-tale story of a lovelorn New Zealander, who ignited a worldwide search to track down an American he'd met once on New Year's Eve, has ground to an abrupt halt, after the girl told him she was 'flattered, but not interested' - though she kept his scarf as a memento. Reese McKee launched a Facebook campaign last month with a heartfelt plea for help in tracking down the mystery 'Katie' who he met just once on New Year's Eve in Hong Kong. His plan was successful, but student Katie Capp has now told smitten Mr McKee that she has good memories of the night, but is not interested in a relationship. Lovelorn: Reese McKee launched a Facebook campaign last month with a heartfelt plea for help in tracking down the mystery 'Katie,' left, who he met just once on New Year's Eve in Hong Kong . Sad: McKee, pictured, found his plan was successful, but student Katie Capp has now told smitten Mr McKee that she has good memories of the night, but is not interested in a relationship . He sent her a heartfelt email, but when she finally replied it was 'lukewarm,' saying only that it was 'a memorable night' for her too. The heart-breaking note read: 'At any rate, I just wanted to tell you that I'm flattered, but not interested in any relationship or whatever. It was a memorable night and I'd just like to leave it at that.' However, Ms Capp did admit to keeping a romantic souvenir from the night- the scarf Mr McKee gave her to keep her warm still hangs in her room. The pair met on New Year's Eve 2012 in Hong Kong. Mr McKee, 25, says he was wandering the city admiring the lights when he saw a girl crying at the side of the road and approached her. 'She was lost. She'd lost all her friends,' he told the New Zealand Herald. 'I just cheered her up. I sort of have this undeniably bad sense of humor that no one can resist laughing at.' Campaign: On his Facebook campaign page, pictured, McKee explained that the next morning he woke up and discovered the picture on his cell phone 'and the good memories came sweeping back' The couple spent the night dancing, . drinking and chatting until 6 a.m., when she reconnected with her . friends and they parted ways. Before she vanished into the night, she told him her name and that she lived in 'D.C'. She posed for a photograph and left him with a bold request: 'Find me.' On his Facebook campaign page, he explained that the next morning he woke up and discovered the picture on his cell phone 'and the good memories came sweeping back.' But he had few clues to track her down and when he tried to find her email address - he had some recollection of it containing the words 'kitty cat' - he had no luck. After months looking for her in vain, he launched a heartfelt appeal on Facebook. Found: The pretty brunette, pictured left and right, tracked down by MailOnline to a small town in the south of France on the Italian border, at first thought she might have feelings for him too . Um no: After thinking it over, the student, pictured, who is taking French classes at a campus of Paris' elite Sciences Po University, decided she didn't feel the same way and rejected his advances . 'I was hurt a long time ago,' he wrote. 'The hopeless romantic in me was locked away when he got hurt because it . was too much. For too long, this has affected my relationships, and . I've failed people. 'Somewhere along the line my romantic soul went silent, and this is a step towards putting that right. 'The chances are billions to one, but I like those odds,' he wrote. 'The is me putting all my chips on the table because it's go hard or go home and I am not going to give in.' He said he had no illusions and that he wouldn't be surprised if Ms Capp had another boyfriend but that he was 'foolishly optimistic.'

"By . Hannah Roberts . If you've always wanted to own a slice of children’s literature, now’s the time. The Tuscan villa that served as the inspiration for the classic fairy tale Pinocchio is up for sale for £9million. The gardens of the mansion, just outside Florence, include a lawn known as the Field of Miracles, that features in the cautionary tale of a wooden puppet who dreams of becoming a real boy. A view of Villa di Colonnata, in Sesto Fiorentino, Florence - the property that inspired Pinocchio's author Carlo Collodi . A rock formation in the lake inspired the moment Pinocchio is swallowed by a whale . This villa inspired the author of Pinocchio and has three hectares of garden including a lawn known as the Field of Miracles . The author, Carlo Collodi, lived near Villa di Colonnata at the time when he wrote 'The Adventures of Pinocchio' 130 years ago, and picked up ideas for his stories in the local tavern. The story inspired one of Disney's best loved animated movies . One of the tales he heard was about the Field of Miracles, a lawn under which a real-life gardener at the villa unearthed a stash of gold coins. In Collodi's fictional story, the crafty Fox and Cat characters induce Pinocchio to bury his gold coins in the field, where they say they will grow and multiply. The 30-room mansion, boasting towers, large wine cellars and 17th century frescos, is advertised for sale on the property website idealista.it for Euro 10million. Local historian Giuseppe Garbarino said that there were numerous areas of the property that appear in the puppet's adventures. In the seven acres of garden is a lake with an island and a cottage that according to local legend is the home of the fairy ‘with the blue hair’ that helps Pinocchio on his travels, he said. 'Beneath her cottage is a cave, with a . tooth-shaped rock, that served as the inspiration for the mouth of the . whale that swallows the puppet in the story. 'Even . the characters of the Fox and the Cat were based on nicknames for local . thieves who had buried their stolen goods in an Etruscan tomb.' The . character of the blue fairy was based on a girl who worked at the house . and and had heard the story of a puppet who came to life from her . mother, he said. Even the characters of the Fox and the Cat were based on nicknames for local thieves who had buried their stolen goods in a tomb . This garden is part of the property that has gone on the market for £9million . The Field of Miracles lawn is where a gardener famously found a hoard of coins in the 19th century, a story that was included in ""The Adventures of Pinocchio"" Mr Garbarino, who is helping to sell the house, said he hopes the new owners develop the literary connection. He said: 'This name is such a draw. It would be wonderful if they would turn the gardens into a Pinocchio Park, with trails and guided tours.' The villa has been in the Gerini family since 1656, when nobleman Ferrante Capponi bought it for 3,000 crowns, but has been a a country residence for noblemen since the 1400s. Pinocchio is the story of humble carpenter Geppetto who carves a wooden puppet out of a walking stick, which magically comes to life. Pinocchio dreams of becoming a real human boy. The story was written in the 1880s as a series published in a children's journal but became famous worldwide as the 1940 Disney film.

"By . Naomi Greenaway . These captivating images of a breathtaking seaside villa may look like they're computer generated, but they are pure unadulterated architectural reality. Nestled in Cape Town's cliff-side, the work of architectural art by South African design duo Greg Truen and Stefan Antoni of SAOTA has a 'seamless flow' between the natural beauty outside and the stunning modern interior. With its jaw-dropping architecture, . including a triple volume gallery in the main living area, uninterrupted . sea and mountain views and utterly lust-worthy interiors, it's no . wonder the property has caught the attention of interior fans around the . globe, including MailOnline's property blogger Celia Sawyer. The incredible villa has a split-level living area, a three-story high gallery and 270 degree views of the Atlantic Ocean and beyond . 'Many of my clients own superb beach houses or water-front apartments, but this residential home is something of a marvel,' she says of the house, which has panoramic views of Cape . Town's iconic Clifton Beaches, some the world's most beautiful, and the . calming waves of the Atlantic Ocean. 'I love the triple volume gallery space they have created inside and praise how the master bedroom floats over into the double volume living space with a striking soft s-curve cantilever.' 'To the rear of the site you can sit and . enjoy the mountains. This level enjoys 270 degree views from Lion’s Head . at the rear to the Bantry Bay ridge on the North and the dramatic sea . views over the Clifton beaches to the West,' she adds. The garden is designed to be protected from infamous Cape Town wind, but still has incredible views of the dramatic landscape . Kick back and relax: The natural tones and organic materials add to the laid back feel in the villa's main lounge . 'On speaking to the architects they told me how the brief was to create a building that maximised the connection with the view and the sea, create a garden on the mountain side of the site and to minimise views over neighbouring buildings. 'I know their team has done this perfectly! The pictures say it all,' she says. For more of Celia's favourite extravagant houses, go to her new blog Posh Property. As well as breathtaking architecture, the 1,624 metre square villa is furnished to perfection by Cape Town-based interior designer studio OKHA.

A bird's-eye-view of the main lounge with it's high ceiling and 270 degree views (left) and the second bedroom (right) The bath is designed to feel like it's on the water's edge -- perfect for a relaxing soak . ‘The building provides a volumetrically . dramatic and dynamic interior space on a grand scale,' says OKHA designer Adam Court. 'The objective of . the interior décor was to create a softer and intimate counterpoint . whilst not jeopardizing the clean, geometric lines of the architecture. 'These elements can harmoniously co-exist and work off each other,’ 'By utilising a broad base of . textures and finishes, the décor feels natural and subtly organic, . comfort being of paramount importance at all times; the overall ambiance . is one of calm and serenity. 'Colour is kept to a bare minimum, the . interior works predominantly with a light and shade tonal range, . allowing the exterior views, the mountain, the ocean and sky and also . the artwork to bring in colour.' With floor-to-ceiling windows from wall-to-wall, it's not a bad spot to watch the sunset . From every angle the cliff-side property takes in the lush surroundings - mountains, gardens, beaches and sea . In the foyer of the mansion there's a glass elevator and a sweeping staircase, which take you to the airy living space. And of course, there's a separate staff entrance too for butler, gardener, housekeeper, cook and anyone else you might want to invite along to make life a little easier. There’s also an entire open level that can be used as a gym or games room as well as an elegant cinema room for private screenings.

Images of refugees standing naked in the open air while waiting to be sprayed for scabies were described as being like 'a concentration camp' after they came to light this week. But Cono Galipo, head of the contractor that runs the Lampedusa centre for processing immigrants, insisted that his workers had done nothing wrong.

Many die attempting the crossing. The film shows at least two men at the detention centre standing with no clothes on, while others are undressing.

Mayor . of Lampedusa Giusi Nicolini told Rai 2 television: ‘Italy should be . ashamed. The system has to change.

"By . Simon Murphy . A TV star is trying to keep sensational claims of sexual misconduct made against her by a former employee secret because she is  ‘a well-known media personality’, it can be revealed. The blonde celebrity, who is a household name, is being accused by the ex-sales director of her  company of sacking him because  he rejected her sexual advances. The explosive claim is one of several allegations, including that she wore provocative clothing, made inappropriate sexual comments and called the 39-year-old employee’s Muslim fiancee a ‘P***’. The blonde female celebrity cannot be named after a ruling by an employment tribunal over sexual misconduct claims (picture posed by model) The former senior executive will claim unfair dismissal against the celebrity and her company at an employment tribunal in London this week. But the celebrity’s lawyers have successfully applied for a reporting restriction to be granted, meaning neither she nor the executive can be named. The Mail on Sunday has learned that the woman’s lawyers argued that, because sexual misconduct allegations were being made, if her identity was made public, regardless of the outcome of the tribunal, her reputation would be irreparably damaged. In addition, it might jeopardise her charity work and her status as a ‘well-known media personality’. It is understood that the employee, who worked for her for six months, will allege that the celebrity, who is in her 50s, said she ‘only employed good-looking men’ and that she made inappropriate comments about the employee’s looks in front of clients. The employee was invited on two foreign work trips, which he did not attend, as the celebrity’s ‘personal chaperone’ and he was asked if he wanted to join her on a visit to the Playboy club. Furthermore, the celebrity – who lives with her partner – confided in the employee that she was having an affair and once tried to set him up on a date with a celebrity friend of hers. It is understood that the respondents deny the allegations and will contest them at the tribunal. Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming said he was concerned by the privacy ruling as 'secrecy normally acts to conceal the truth over time' A source told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘She’s doing everything she can to stop this from coming out. It’s just not right. She’s an absolute nightmare and when she eventually realised nothing was ever going to happen, she got rid of him.’ When The Mail on Sunday spoke to the employment tribunal on Friday afternoon they confirmed that a reporting restriction had been granted the previous day. Asked for an explanation, an employee said: ‘Because it involves an allegation of sexual misconduct.

"By . Sara Malm . Soldiers who will provide security at the World Cup in Brazil turned out as if they were preparing for war as they marched in Rio de Janeiro. They wore full body armour and showed off their full chemical suits and shotguns as police chiefs instructed visiting fans not to fight back against potential robbers during the football tournament this summer. Campaign leaflets, which also instruct visitors not to scream if they are being robbed, will be distributed to football fans arriving in Rio de Janeiro, in order to prevent robberies leading to homicides during the World Cup. Sao Paulo has seen an increased rate of robberies ending in homicides, and is now telling tourists to hand over their valuables without a fight if they are threatened. Out in force: Soldiers will provide security during the World Cup in Rio de Janeiro next month . Patrol: 4,000 regular police officers will be joined by a further 1,500 military offices during the tournament . Preparations: A soldier wears a chemical suit during the presentation of troops . Sao Paulo, the biggest city in Brazil, is ramping up security ahead of the nationwide event which, quite literally, kicks off on June 12. All 12 host cities are carrying out preparations to ensure foreign visitors remain safe during the month-long tournament, but Sao Paulo is the first to give specific instructions to how to act during a robbery. ‘Tourists coming from Europe or the US don't come frequently and aren't used to seeing these types of crimes. 'Since they're not used to it, they will react to an assault,’ police officer Mario Leite told the Estado de S.Paulo newspaper. PC Leite said the campaign leaflets will be distributed on airplanes heading to Brazil ahead of the World Cup. Members of the army, right, and navy, behind, took part in the  ceremony . A soldier holds a chemical and radiation detector . Plan of action: Leaflets instructing visitors not to scream if they are being robbed will be distributed to fans . Safety: All 12 host cities are carrying out preparations to ensure visitors remain safe during the tournament . Another threat: A woman holds a banner reading 'There wont be a Cup' in Sao Paulo, as new allegations of corruption mar the upcoming tournament . The brochures will be available in English, Spanish and French and warn against ‘showing off possessions, walking alone at night, and recommend that tourists make sure they are not being followed,’ South China Morning Post reports. They will also instruct tourists not to ‘react, scream or argue with robbers’. Robberies that end in homicide have increased by nine per cent in Sao Paulo since last year, a nine year high for the Brazilian city. Meanwhile, the price of building or refurbishing the arenas in the 12 host cities has nearly quadrupled from initial estimates, not only helping make Brazil's World Cup the priciest in history, but also fuelling anger over corruption. A report from government auditors found instances of what appears to be flagrant overpricing, particularly in the case of the stadium in the capital of Brasilia, funded solely by the taxpayer. Preparations: A man walks past the banner of the official 2014 FIFA World Cup sticker album in Sao Paulo, where the security leaflets are set to be given to all tourists as they board airplanes to the city . For instance, the auditor's report says transportation of pre-fabricated grandstands in the Brasilia arena was supposed to cost just $4,700 — but the construction consortium billed the government $1.5 million. Data from Brazil's top electoral court shows that contributions to political campaigns by the very building companies involved in the most Cup projects have skyrocketed in recent months. Anger over perceived corruption helped fuel huge protests last year, and there are fears more unrest could mar the World Cup. Today, England manager Roy Hodgson unveiled his 23-man squad, taking a side packed with young talent as the country bid to end their 48-year wait for a second world title. The players picked to head to Brazil include Luke Shaw, Rickie Lambert, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Raheem Sterling as well as the more seasoned Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney.","Sao Paulo police issue leaflets to World Cup fans travelling to Brazil .

"By . Naomi Greenaway . If you love being outdoors but don't find sitting in the wind, cold, wet or even extreme heat particularly comfortable, have we got an idea for you ....the Casa Bubble. Put one of these beautiful works of architectural art in your garden and you can feel like you're outdoors all year long, without being bothered by any offensive weather. Scroll down for video . Extreme glamping: The Casa Bubble on sandy shores . A room with a view: the inflatable bubble tent has great views . The Bubbles retail at £4,000- £9,300 (see full details at casabubble.com), with rental fees from £900 per night for the basic bubble, up to £2,000 for the 'grand lodge', plus shipping from France. The dreamy tents were created by two French designers; architect Pierre-Stephane, who lives near Paris, and Frederic Richard, who divides his time between France and the US. The pair designed the houses to create, 'A maximum of pleasure, . for a minimum of material and energy expenditure'. Frameless and virtually roofless, the bubbles are inflated by a special turbine which keeps it in shape, renews the air and eliminates pollen, humidity and condensation. The Casa Bubble comes in three different designs -- from fully transparent (above) to almost fully opaque . Inside, the air is fresh and filtered, there are no mosquitoes and, according to its architects, the acoustics are particularly soothing. 'The original idea comes form my childhood dream to sleep under the Milky Way,' designer Frederic tells MailOnline. 'So that's what Pierre and I decided to do -- but in a much more comfortable way! We wanted to create a cozy hotel bedroom with the starry sky as the ceiling.' So what does it feel like to sleep in your very own bubble? 'Amazing is the word!' he says. Being structureless, the bubble needs to . be inflated permanently in order to support the dome. The 'grande lodge' has a separate living room and bedroom, pictured here at nightfall . Inside the 'Bubble Drop', one of the more opaque Casa Bubbles, designed for hot temperatures . The . air being filtered, the atmosphere inside the dome is almost ten times cleaner than outside. No pollens, no allergens, no dust and no . mosquitoes either. There are three different types of bubble. The Cristal Bubble, which is fully transparent, the Bubble Room, which is half opaque and the Bubble Drop, almost fully opaque but with a circular clear window in the roof to allow a view of the sky and stars. They're also produced in different materials, suitable for different geographic areas, weather and local temperatures. The Casa Bubbles have a bedroom and bathroom and a view of the stars . 'The standard bubbles are made of the highest grade of new PVC's. This for standard temperature from 3°C to 50°C,' says Frederic. 'For cold climates, we propose a new TPU (Thermo-Polyurethane) bubble, suitable for temperatures as low as -40°C. 'For very hot countries, we propose our fully opaque Bubble Drop in a material we call sunblock. This material reflects up to 95% of the sun intakes. It's perfect for hot area like deserts when the temperatures are high during the day and very cold at night! Inside the Casa Bubble is a bathroom (left) and bedroom (right) So how long does it take to put up your personal bubble? 'It's easy!' promises Frederic. 'For one person, it will take 50 minutes.' The Casa Bubbles, which sell to private clients as well as corporates, are environmentally friendly too. They are made of 100 per cent recyclable material and are ethically manufactured . When deflated and packed, a 13ft bubble in its bag will fit on your rear car seat and weighs only 50kg. The Casa Bubble from above, which is inflated and kept fresh using a mini turbine . And how will they withstand rainy climates? 'I would say that the bubbles are water resistant than water proof,' says Frederic. 'In very bad conditions with prolonged heavy rain some drops may come in. Although we haven't had any complaints so far.' 'And in the heat we recommend finding a relatively shady area and propose using the Sunblock Bubble Drop version.' Frederic adds, 'Being laid in your queen size bed, under the duvet like in your bedroom and watching the stars, the planes and the satellites crossing the sky is an incredible experience. 'When I stayed in one of these in a wood, so many animals come to see what was going on with this strange flying saucer -- deers, coyotes and raccoons.' Living in a bubble has never sounded so appealing. The perfect setting: The bubble case takes camping to a new level .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Imagine asking a friend to take a photo of you snorkeling when all of a sudden a giant blue parrotfish pops in front of a camera. That was the situation faced by Sophia Roth in Key West, Florida, at the weekend. The owner of Snuba, a local diving tour company, was out with a group checking out the many coral reefs in the area. She was smiling for the camera when all of a sudden a parrotfish came out of nowhere and swims in front of the lens. Boo! This parrotfish came out of nowhere at Eastern Dry Rocks in Key West, Florida, to surprise diver Sophia Roth ... and steal her photo . Hilariously, it also seems that the fish is smiling too. 'It's one of my favorite (pictures),' Roth said. 'The picture is funny because the parrot fish looks like he is looking at the camera and smiling. 'It's cute.' Key West has the third largest barrier reef in the world, and is the perfect environment for the likes of parrotfish to live. Parrotfish earned their name due to their teeth, which form a parrot-like beak used to graze algae from coral and rocks. They are found in relatively shallow tropical and subtropical oceans throughout the world, with the majority of species reaching 30-50 cm in length. Parrotfish are considered a huge benefit to protecting coral reefs because they eat algae and excrete sand . The parrotfish is not the only creature who has shown a love for a camera, with llamas, stingrays and an elephant also previously photobombing tourists' shots. The colorful and voracious herbivores were recently named by National Geographic as 'the #1 thing to ensure the health of coral reefs'. This is because they spend 90 percent of their day eating algae. They also excrete sand, which is of huge benefit to sand erosion. National Geographic say parrotfish excrete over 200 pounds per year. Protecting parrotfish and urchins can help restore coral reefs.","Parrotfish earned their name due to their teeth, which form a parrot-like beak used to graze algae from coral and rocks .

"By . Sam Webb . The U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom was seen at a London celebrity hotspot, complete with armed bodyguards. Matthew Barzun, who took up the prestigious role in 2013, enjoyed an evening at the Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, where Madonna was also seen spotted last night. As he left one of his entourage's jackets flapped open, revealing what appeared to be a taser - a non-lethal electrical weapon used to subdue criminals. It is likely the armed man is a member of the Diplomatic Protection Group (DPG), a Specialist Operations branch of the Metropolitan Police Service that provides protection and support to diplomats, as well as diplomatic buildings such as embassies. The DPG has more than 800 armed officers. U.S. ambassador Matthew Barzun (left) leaving the Chiltern Firehouse last night. He left flanked by bodyguards who had what appeared to be Tasers under their jackets . Shocking: It is likely the armed man is a member of the Diplomatic Protection Group of the Met Police . The Chiltern Firehouse has attracted luminaries like Lindsay Lohan, Cheryl Cole, Cara Delevingne, Katy Perry and David Beckham since opening in February. Mr Barzun is married to the heiress of the Jack Daniels whiskey empire. His wife, Brooke, is a member of the family that controls one of the world’s biggest drinks companies, Brown-Forman. The Kentucky-based company has a turnover of £1.6billion and owns the Jack Daniel’s, Southern Comfort and Finlandia Vodka brands. Mr Barzun, 43, is the former ambassador to Sweden and a key fundraiser for President Obama, having banked a million dollars from donors and serving as finance chairman for the re-election campaign. Madonna pictured arriving at the Chiltern Firehouse for dinner. The Marylebone venue is a celeb hotspot . The president has raised eyebrows with key diplomatic appointments going to supporters and fundraisers in the past. He appointed Dan Rooney, the owner of NFL team the Pittsburgh Steelers and a campaigner on Obama's behalf, to the role of U.S. ambassador to Ireland. Mr Barzun was raised in Massachusetts and educated at Harvard. He made his money with the gadget news and reviews website CNET, before starting his own consultancy for internet media firms. He has supported the Democratic party from an early age and was a student intern for John Kerry in 1989. The father-of-three can trace his family lineage back to John Winthrop, a wealthy English Puritan lawyer who was instrumental in the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the first major Pilgrim settlement after Plymouth Colony, and a leading light in the colonial movement. Ironically, Winthrop's puritan beliefs would likely have made him a keen opponent of alcohol.","Matthew Barzun was seen at noted celebrity hangout last night .

"By . Aaron Kanaan . Courtney Robertson accepted her now ex-fiancé Ben Flajnik’s final rose and his marriage proposal on Season 16 of The Bachelor and famously had a quickie after she lured the wine-maker into the sea in Puerto Rico for a bit of skinny-dipping. But in her new book the reality star is dishing the dirt on a few of her other famous flings. 'You meet a lot of interesting people living in Los Angeles,’ Courtney tells MailOnline in an exclusive interview, adding that fans won’t be disappointed with I Didn’t Come Here to Make Friends: Confessions of a Reality Show Villain, ‘a juicy read’ that’s ‘full of spicy moments.’ Scroll down for video . Dirty Girl: The Bachelor star Courtney Robertson doesn't hold back in her new book I Didn't Come Here to Make Friends . ‘I guess I could have been a little less graphic in parts, but that's just not my nature,’ Courtney, 30, explains of how she detailed her racy romances with several well-known Hollywood hotties. One of those candid confessions involves Entourage actor Adrian Grenier, who Courtney calls ‘sweet but non-committal.’ And she confesses that he was quite a huge catch. ‘He had the biggest penis I’d ever seen,’ Courtney writes. The two never quite got their relationship off the ground, but that didn’t stop Adrian from sexting Courtney for years. Under the sea: Courtney and The Bachelor Ben Flajnik made the sparks fly. The pair's initial sexual encounter was after she lured the wine-maker into the sea in Puerto Rico for a bit of skinny-dipping . While Adrian didn’t make the cut, Jesse Metcalfe swept Courtney off her feet. She even calls the Dallas star one of the loves of her life. Courtney, a successful model, reveals she first met Jesse in 2004 when he spotted her while driving his black Escalade around L.A. He immediately slammed on the brakes, got out of the vehicle and ran over and begged for her number. Once the two connected the chemistry was red-hot. Unfortunately, notes Courtney, ‘Jesse was exciting and passionate but a total mess.’ He was also a big cheater. ‘As much as I liked Jesse, I never felt like I could trust him,’ writes Courtney, noting that ‘I can count on three hands the guys I’ve slept with — and I’ve never cheated on anyone.’ That point was driven home one night when she slept over at Jesse’s house and discovered another woman’s trashy pink lace panties in his bed. Panty raid: Courtney wasn't too thrilled when she found a pair of pink panties in boyfriend Jesse Metcalfe's bed . No score: 300 star Gerard Butler texted Courtney asking to hook up - but she passed . But the couple’s intense relationship finally came to a close when Jesse told Courtney he was going to Palm Springs for a little getaway. She discovered his big lie after paparazzi photos were splashed all over TMZ.com of Jesse straddling and making out with a busty blonde in Venice Beach. Always on the lookout for true love, the former Bachelor star agreed to go out with CAA agent Jim Toth when a mutual model friend insisted they meet. Though Courtney says Reese Witherspoon’s now husband was ‘down-to-earth’ on their date, at 13 years her senior Jim was looking to start a family and just ‘too old for me at the time.’ Courtney has become a pursued object of attraction for a long list of Hollywood lotharios including 300 hunk Gerard Butler. Regarding 'Gerry' Butler, Courtney said: 'He texted me in the middle of the day. I realized I'd be giving up (a modeling fee worth $20k) to spend a few hours with a horny movie star. I went to work.' Courtney's honest nature means she is extremely open in her book about everything from The Bachelor behind-the-scenes secrets (the show tests for STD's) to what really happened with her engagement to Ben — much to his chagrin. Packed: Although Courtney says she didn't exactly have 'sex' with Adrian Grenier, she did enough to be impressive with the size of The Entourage star's manhood . No holding back: Besides spilling the beans on some of her successful - and not so successful - Hollywood encounters, Courtney talks behind the scenes of The Bachelor in her new book . 'He sent me an email after reading the . book,' Courtney reveals to MailOnline. 'He's disappointed in my decision . to make these things public about our engagement.’ But he might want to rethink his stance. Though she had no problem writing about how she and Ben ‘did have sex in the ocean. On-camera,’ while filming The Bachelor in Puerto Rico, Courtney says she left out a few choice anecdotes about her former fiancé and some of the other people who have been in her life. ‘There were plenty of stories that weren't mine to share,’ she tells MailOnline. ‘And I didn't want to hurt anyone. If it pertained to my story to find love it made the cut.’ Now Courtney believes her ongoing quest for the perfect partner has taught her a valuable lesson. ‘Sometimes in life you have to take chances,’ she says. ‘I took a big swing at love and struck out.’ Though she’s nervous about the chance she took on laying bare her experiences, “putting your entire life story out there makes you feel pretty vulnerable,’ she says —she promises fans and foes it is a fun and entertaining beach read. Worst case scenario? ‘If you hate it you can fan yourself with it,’ laughs Courtney.","The Bachelor star Courtney Robertson tells MailOnline her autobiography is 'full of spicy moments'

"By . Sam Webb . Accused: Daniel Spencer, 59, allegedly killed his former spouse Jane Wiggett, 57, at her home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire . A 'jealous' man murdered his ex-wife then hid her body inside her bed - where it lay undiscovered for three weeks, a court heard. Daniel Spencer, 59, allegedly killed his former spouse Jane Wiggett, 57, at her home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire on July 24 last year. Bristol Crown Court heard the father-of-two placed the grandmother’s body inside her bed, with pillows and blankets tucked around her. A search party of friends and family gained entry to Ms Wiggett’s home two days later, after becoming concerned when she failed to turn up for appointments. They looked around the property but did not spot the body as it was so well hidden beneath the 'carefully' made bed, a jury heard. Spencer, of Prestbury Road, Cheltenham, allegedly told Ms Wiggett’s friends and family that she was on holiday in Penzance, Cornwall, and in contact with him. But as weeks went on, suspicions began to build and Ms Wiggett was reported missing to police on August 15 - with officers discovering her body the following day. The jury heard Spencer, who denies a charge of murdering Ms Wiggett, initially told police he would 'hand himself in' but then attempted to flee the country. Richard Smith QC, prosecuting, told a jury of six men and six women, Ms Wiggett had remained friends with her husband despite their divorce 10 years ago. 'Jane Wiggett, you may consider, couldn’t live with this defendant but equally perhaps nor could she live entirely without him,” Mr Smith said. 'This was a jealous man. On Wednesday July 24 last year, this defendant visited his then ex-wife in her flat in Cheltenham. Something happened to anger him and upset him. 'There was something of a struggle. Jane Wiggett resisted, it seems, his attack upon her. But the defendant took her by the throat and this time it culminated in him taking her life. 'He put and left Jane’s body lying in her own bed, positioned on her back. Her face was covered with a pillow, her quilt was then carefully put over her as if to hide the fact that she was dead inside.' Bristol Crown Court heard the father-of-two placed the grandmother¿s body inside her bed, with pillows and blankets tucked around her . Mr Smith said Spencer and Ms Wiggett had been married for 30 years, during which she twice reported him to the police for grabbing her by the throat. The couple finally divorced in 2005 but stayed in close contact, living in the same area of Cheltenham and spending time with each other. Mr Smith said Ms Wiggett, who weighed just seven-and-a-half stone, was last seen on the evening of July 24 - after which her phones and credit cards were not used. 'This defendant, knowing what he had done, set about doing his best to try in the first instance to cover up her absence,' the prosecutor said. 'A part of that cover up was to lie to people about where she was - he knew she was at home dead in her bed but he said his ex-wife had gone on a spontaneous holiday. 'He mentioned Cornwall and her being in contact with him on the telephone. It was a guise that all was well.' Mr Smith said friends and family decided to visit Ms Wiggett on July 26 and gained access to her flat. 'They didn’t notice Jane’s body lying under the quilt and blanket, covered over with pillows, in her bed,' he said. However, police were called at 7.48pm on August 15. Officers visited the flat at 3am the following morning and discovered the body. A post-mortem examination found Ms Wiggett had been hit before her death, which was caused by strangulation. Mr Smith said traces of Spencer’s blood were discovered under her fingernails and phone records showed he had not attempted to call her at any time after July 24. Police contacted Spencer, who promised to 'hand himself in' but actually travelled up north before staying at a hotel near Birmingham airport under a false name, he added. A member of staff at the hotel recognised Spencer from a police appeal and called officers, who arrested him on August 19. 'His passport was in his possession and at the ready,' Mr Smith said. Spencer denies murder and the trial, expected to last for two weeks in front of Mr Justice Hamblen, continues.

The fans have been camped out for days, the UK's strawberry farmers are rubbing their hands in glee and industrial quantities of Pimms are being delivered to south London: Wimbledon is back. But it's not all Pimms and strawberries. Descending on the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club are some of the world's best players and supporting them every step of the way will be there loyal wives and girlfriends. Leading the pack is defending champion Andy Murray's girlfriend, Kim Sears - whose facial expressions reflect the feelings of the nation when she grimaces at Andy's double faults and smiles with joy when he clinches victory. His biggest fan: Kim was delighted when Andy clinched victory at last . year's Wimbledon. She'll be cheering him all the way again as he defends . his title . While Kim will be cheering Andy Murray on from the stands, another tennis WAG, Maria . Sharapova, will have work on her mind. Fresh . from victory at the French Open, Maria already seems to have inspired her other half . Grigor Dimitrov up his game, with recent wins including victory in the Aegon Championships at Queens Club a . fortnight ago. But the glamorous, successful Sharapova isn't the only tennis WAG with a career to match - or surpass - her man's. As the action gets underway in London, FEMAIL rounds up the women who'll be hoping their man is a winner at Wimbledon. Kim Sears has been in a relationship with Andy Murray for the nine years and he has admitted he couldn't have come back to win Wimbledon in 2013 following his 2012 defeat if it hadn't been for her unwavering support. Loyal: Pretty Kim shuns the limelight and spends her days painting dogs and cats and selling them online,  but never misses an important tournament . Unlike many football WAGS, Kim shys away from the spotlight as she focuses on her career as an artist and looks after the couple's beloved dogs Maggie May and Rusty at their home in Surrey. She's a fan of the British high street, with Zara and Whistles among her favourites, and is likely to be spotted showcasing both at this year's tournament - along with avoiding questions on when Andy will propose. Top tennis player Maria Sharapova will be backing her boyfriend Grigor Dimitrov all the way but more importantly, she will also be on her own quest for Wimbledon glory and is hotly tipped to do well. Taking part: Maria Sharapova will be supporting boyfriend Grigor . Dimitrov but the tennis champ will also be focusing on her own game . Both champs: Maria was in the stands to see Grigor win the Aegon Championships at Queens Club earlier this month . The Russian won the title in 2004 but has struggled with her form in recent years on the grass. Tennis' power couple have been dating since 2012 and Maria's winning ways certainly seem to be rubbing off on her other half. So far this year Dimitrov has taken the men's singles title at Queens and hopes for a good showing at Wimbledon, while Sharapova herself triumphed at Roland Garros. Rather sweetly, Dimitrov credited his other half with helping him to his recent victory. He said: 'She's just been unbelievable, supporting me throughout the year. The feeling is pretty mutual.' Roger Federer's wife Mirka could be forgiven for not watching him at every match this year, after giving birth to twins Leo and Lenny in May. The couple already had twin girls, four-year-old Myla Rose and Charlene Riva. Federer, who has won 17 grand slam titles, currently has no thoughts of retiring and likes to take his family with him when he travels to tournaments around the world. Big family: Mirka Federer gave birth to twin sons Leo and Lenny in May and, with husband Roger, already has four-year-old twin daughters, Myla Rose and Charlene Riva . He said at a press conference after his sons were born that taking them all on the road is hard work but worth it. 'My wife does a lot of work, as much as she can. And I try to help as much as I can,' he explained. 'We have the grandparents as well and all my team members, they sometimes just tag along. Clearly we also need some help on the road, so Mirka can have an opportunity sometimes to sleep in a little bit, or come to watch one of my matches. 'You need to be well organised, but by now we know how it works. I am looking forward to life on the tour with the family, and it will be a long time without any travelling after the tennis is over. So I'm looking forward to the next couple of years now.' Beautiful Maria Xisca Perello has been inundated with requests to take part in photo shoots but like other tennis WAGS, the girlfriend of world number one Rafael Nadal shuns the limelight. Look of love: Tennis star Rafael Nadal with his girlfriend Maria Francisca Perello at an Enrique Iglesias concert in Barcelona last year . Support: Like Nadal, Maria is a fan of keeping fit but unlike her other half, she's not so keen on travel and refused to attend the Australian Open because it was 'too far' The couple have been dating since they were teenagers but she doesn't travel to watch him at all his tournaments. When Rafa played in the Australian Open final earlier this year, he said his girlfriend hadn't come to watch as it was 'too far'. Speaking about their relationship earlier this year, a friend of the couple, Pedro Hernadez, said: 'Raf and Xisca are both very shy and ordinary people who like to live simply. 'They are not at all interested in a celebrity lifestyle. They get together when the tournaments are over. That's how Raf winds down.' Although currently expecting a baby with her other half, Novak Djokovic, Jelena Ristic has no intention of giving up her day job - masterminding Djokovic's charity for disadvantaged children from their native Serbia. Blessed: Jelena Ristic and Novak Djokovic are looking forward to becoming parents later this year but Ristic won't be giving up her charity work . The current world number two announced that the couple were soon to become parents on Twitter earlier this year writing: 'Jelena is pregnant!!! We will be parents soon! #blessed'. If a coming child wasn't enough of a blessing, the pair, who announced their engagement in September last year, are expected to tie the knot after this year's Wimbledon.

"By . Aaron Kanaan . Mark your calendars! It's a September wedding for George Clooney and his bride-to-be Amal Alamuddin. The couple, who were introduced at a charity event last September, are planning on making the one-year anniversary of their first meeting their wedding day. ‘If all goes as they are planning, Amal and George will be husband and wife within less than five months,’ reveals a family friend. Clooney turned 53 on May 6, and he’s given himself quite the gift — an entirely different life. The actor shocked the world when he reversed gears on his long-standing ban on marriage and got engaged to Beirut-born lawyer, Amal. Scroll down for video . Not long to wait: It's a September wedding for George Clooney (L) and his bride-to-be Amal Alamuddin (R), who were introduced at a charity event last September . New life: The actor shocked the world when he reversed gears on his long-standing ban on marriage and got engaged to the Beirut-born lawyer . Now. the longtime family friend of the traditional family reveals exclusively to MailOnline the details behind the happy couple’s journey from the single life to falling in love and, in five months, to wedded bliss. George had to go through a vigorous vetting before Amal would even consent to go out with him last fall. ‘He asked her out three times before she finally agreed,’ says the friend. ‘Tradition is extremely important to her Lebanese family, so Amal contacted her parents to discuss it before she would agree to go out with him.' According to the pal, letting her family know that she was going to date George was Amal’s way of showing them respect. And George had to do the same once he decided he was finally ready to take their relationship to the next level. Family affair: Amal's mother Baria Alamuddin (in white, standing at the back), father Ramzi K.Alamuddin (sitting in front of her on the sofa) and other family members are thrilled for Amal and George. Amal is believed to be the baby being held by her grandmother . Seal of approval: A longtime friend tells MailOnline that George had to go through a vigorous vetting process before Amal's dad Ramzi and mom Baria before the 36-year-old lawyer would even consent to go out with him. Tradition is very important to the Lebanese family . Before asking for Amal’s hand in marriage with a 7-carat emerald-cut diamond, George and the international law and human rights attorney flew to Dubai for a few days in March to meet up with her half-brothers brothers, Samer and Ziad, sister, Tala, and father, Ramzi. The friend reveals that George met 36-year-old Amal’s London-based editor mother, Baria, more times than her dad, the retired owner of a travel agency called Cosmo. MailOnline had reported exclusively that the dashing Hollywood star was been notably absent during the pre-Oscar bashes around Los Angeles and skipped the after-parties on March 2. He was on his way to London to meet up with Amal and then fly on to Dubai. ‘That trip was kind of Clooney’s indirect way of showing her father he was serious about her before asking for her hand in marriage.’ According to the friend, during their March trip George proved that he was more than just a good-looking movie star. ‘Amal’s dad is definitely more impressed with Clooney’s political and humanitarian involvement than he is with his fame and wealth,’ the friend notes to MailOnline. ‘Ramzi prefers his daughter is associated with a guy with brains and no money over a guy with no brains and lots of money.’ Three's a charm: George had to ask the Lebanese beauty out on a date three times before she said yes. Now she's sporting a 7-carat emerald cut diamond that George helped design on her left hand . Amal and George played their relationship right with the family, but they did make one major faux pas. 'He wanted his proposal to be a surprise so he told very few people,’ reveals the friend. George got down on one knee to pop the question to Amal at a romantic restaurant on April 22.The brunette stunner showed the gem off alongside the actor at his friend Rande Gerber's 52nd birthday dinner in Santa Barbara on April 27. Unfortunately, ‘the family learned Amal was engaged from the press, and her brothers and sister also didn't learn about it until later,' the friend added. The family is willing to overlook the slight, says the friend. But there is one major unresolved issue about the Big Day. Scene of the wedding: Will George and Amal say 'I do' in Amal's tranquil village of Baaqlin? Or will the couple choose New York or London for their nuptials? George wants a low-key affair but Amal's family has something else in mind . ‘George doesn’t want a huge to-do, but what he doesn’t really understand yet is that a “small” wedding for a Lebanese family is around 200 people,’ laughs the friend. ‘I think they will end up having a smaller wedding than Amal’s family expects and that will make a lot of the Lebanese relatives unhappy.’ If the couple decides to hold the wedding in the U.S. or in England, ‘George better have a fleet of private jets ready to fly all the relatives who are expecting to be invited,’ says the friend. Amal’s parents and siblings ‘just want her to be happy and right now is the happiest they’ve ever seen her.’ Actor pal and Monuments Men co-star Matt Damon adds: 'I'm just thrilled that he met Amal and that they're as happy as they are, He deserves it.'","George is planning to wed the Beirut-born lawyer in a year from the date they first met at a charity event .

"By . Sam Webb . Fraud: Nicola Daly, 39, has to pay back a nine-year, £100k fraud with £50 a week - which will take her 178 years . A benefits cheat has been given 178 years to pay back the money she swindled from taxpayers. Nicola Daly claimed £100,000 in council tax, housing benefit and income support payments for almost nine years. Today Daly, of Tilehurst, Berkshire, was starting a 16-month jail sentence for the fraud which was only discovered after her elderly mother-in-law inadvertently revealed the deception it with a residential care application. A judge heard that Daly claimed the cash after lying to her local council that she was raising her two children alone. In fact the cheat had lived with her partner, who worked for John Lewis, for several years and continued to do so despite repeatedly claiming she had been estranged from him for 15 years. The trickster was finally caught after her elderly mother-in-law applied for residential care and declared that she owned a house where her son Steven Randall and Daly both lived. The 39-year-old was sentenced to 16 months in prison at Reading Crown Court after admitting five charges of fraud and making false statements. The court heard she is repaying the amount at a rate of £50 a month, which will take a staggering 178 years for the total to be recovered. Alison Ginn prosecuting, said: 'Between June 2004 and March 2013, very nearly nine years, Daly claimed and received benefits in the form of income support, housing support and council tax benefits to which she was not entitled. 'The total amount she received was £107,154 and 50p,' she said. 'She was representing that she was a single parent living with her children when in fact she lived with their father, Steven Randall, who was employed from June 2004 at John Lewis in Bracknell, Berkshire.' Reading Crown Court, where Daly was given a 16-month jail sentence for the fraud . The court heard that Daly had clearly stated on benefit claim forms to Reading Borough Council that she only lived with her two children, now aged five and 11 years. Mrs Ginn said: 'Reading Borough Council requested more information and she said that she was not in contact with Steven Randall and he had not paid any maintenance for his children.' She added in subsequent claims that she had not spoken the man she lived with for 15 years. 'It all came to light when Mr Randall's mother, Ivy, completed an application for people seeking residential care, on which she said she jointly owned a premises with her son, who lived there with his partner and children,' said Mrs Ginn. 'Mr Randall's wages were being paid into this defendant's bank account, the same one into which her benefits were paid.' The trickster was finally caught after her elderly mother-in-law applied for residential care and declared that she owned a house where her son Steven Randall and Daly both lived . When Daly was questioned by police in March 2013, she lied and said the father of her children was Mr Randall's brother Darren. She claimed to have never been in a relationship with Mr Randall and said his wages were only paid into her account as he had debt problems. However, she requested a second interview a month later and admitted her web of lies, telling police she lied as she 'thought she could get away with it'. Graham Bennett, mitigating, said Daly had some previous convictions but none for over a decade. He said that at the time of the initial false claim, she and her partner had struggled with drug addictions and she had just given birth to their first child. 'She was in significant financial difficulties,' said Mr Bennett. 'The income support gave rise to council tax and housing benefit and the same false declarations were made. Regrettably she did not correct matters and this continued throughout the years.' He said the couple had married in April this year and Daly was working part-time to repay her debt at £50 per month. 'It is not a repayment that is going to be dealt with swiftly but her intent is to repay as much as possible,' said Mr Bennett. He asked Judge Johannah Cutts to consider a suspended prison sentence due to the difficulty a custodial term would present to her young family. Judge Cutts said she recognised that 'life had been difficult' for Daly in 2004 and commended her for beating her drug addiction, but condemned her lies. 'Social securities support is not to pay people who feel hard up, it doesn't come from a limitless supply of cash,' she said. 'Taxpayers money is used in a benevolent society to help those truly in need and you did not fall into that category.' Sentencing Daly to 16 months in prIson, she added: 'It is often the families of those who commit crimes who suffer the most.' Three related charges, which Daly denied, were left to lay on file by the Crown Prosecution Service.","Nicola Daly claimed to be a single mother, but actually lived with partner .

"By . Aaron Kanaan . On the Bravo series Southern Charm, Jenna King claims to be a well-to-do South Carolina girl who just can’t stay away from the place she and the rest of the cast consider home - Charleston. But in truth Jenna comes from humble beginnings and her affection for the Palmetto state doesn’t seem to run as deep as it appeared on screen. Not so southern: Jenna King grew up in South Carolina all right, but not exactly in the town she says she came from. And she didn't exactly hang around the Palmetto state after shooting the reality show . Home sweet home: She grew up in this double-wide trailer down a dirt road in rural Wedgefield, SC . House of cards: When Jenna was asked on the show  how she could afford the pricey four-bedroom digs in Charlestown, she answered, 'With my bank account.' But the truth is Jenna never owned or even lived in it. While Jenna gushed in one interview that she did Southern Charm because she wanted to spend time with ‘the two most important things’ in her life — friends and family — one neighbor who lives just down the dirt road from her mom Jane and step-dad Mike’s double-wide trailer throws that sentiment into doubt. 'It’s been a long time since Jenna’s come around,’ reveals the neighbor. Jenna’s presence in Charleston is just as rare — unless the cameras are rolling. Though she insisted on the show that ‘there is no place like home,’ the 29-year-old hasn’t been spotted in the charming little city since at least last spring when she ‘lived’ in an extravagant four-bedroom, four-story historic home on Ashley Avenue. In one memorable scene on the show, . Brandy, a friend of Jenna’s cast mate, Whitney Sudler-Smith, asks where . she got the money for such a nice place. Southern charmer: Jenna  liked to flaunt her beauty even as a kid. On the show she made it seem that she had plenty of dough. Play dough maybe? ‘With my bank account,’ Jenna snipes. Maybe not. The answer to the mystery of how she could afford such lavish living may lie in Bravo network’s expense account  - and what amounted to a pricey hotel for the reality show shoot. ‘The house was temporarily rented last . year just for the Bravo shoot,’ a local real estate professional reveals . to MailOnline. ‘They used it for some interior and exterior shots and . Jenna had absolutely nothing else to do with the property. She never . lived there or owned it.’ 'I’ve never . seen anyone go in or out of the house, we’ve always thought that no one . lived there,’ 20-year-old College of Charleston student Nicole DeMarco, . who has lived next door to the historic property since last summer, . tells MailOnline. ‘It’s completely dark.’ The . entire building is up for sale. The real owners of the property, . currently listed for $1.785 million, are a local couple who live full . time on the beach and want to offload it. Blondie: Is it true blondes have more fun? Jenna did. As a teen, Jenna was a popular cheerleader in high school and loved listening to Peaches & Cream by 112 . In fact, . Jenna’s last real residence in Charleston was a simple one-floor, . three-bedroom rental on Saint Margaret Street that she shared in 2007 . with other students while attending Trident Technical College. After she . moved out of state, the property was sold for $295,000 and re-rented for . $1900 a month, or less than $650 per bedroom. These . days Jenna’s life is almost solely concentrated far away from South . Carolina in Los Angeles, where she lives the good life. Mama King: Jenna hugs mom Jane as they get set to take off in Lou's jet. 'I take my momma everywhere' Sugar daddy: At first Jenna denied that Lou was her meal ticket. But the wealthy real estate mogul lavished her with Louboutins and designer togs . Much . of Jenna's around-the-world escapades were thanks to Lou, her . 55-year-old real estate magnate boyfriend at the time she shot show. Although she vehemently denied  being a golddigger, saying she 'would have married . Lou seven years ago. It’s not about money for me at all, ’ Lou . reportedly footed the bill, including for her pricey clothes. On Bravo's April 28 reunion special, . Jenna confessed that her closet full of Christian Louboutin shoes, which . often run over $1000 a pair, was thanks to Lou and his wallet — and . that the cost was nothing to him. And . when host Andy Cohen pressed her on exactly what she did for money, Jenna quipped, 'I'm really good at rolling the dice playing Craps.' School days: 'I love a good bowl cut,"" says Jenna, photographed on her first day of school. Any real wealth she has  is more likely tied to  real estate investments with Lou, who is rumored to deal in large property developments around the world. But Jenna recently confessed that she broke up with Lou and she's taken to traveling around with Ronnie Radke, lead vocalist of Falling in Reverse. In her . Bravo bio, Jenna claims she grew up in Sumter, South Carolina, a small . city with a population of 40,000. In reality, she hails from Wedgefield, . a village ten miles away that has just over 3,000 residents. And that little white lie doesn’t sit right with one local. Well-heeled: Jenna flashing a pair of Louboutin stilettos on Lou's jet . ‘I told people if I were ever to get . famous I wouldn’t claim Sumter, I’d claim Wedgefield,’ local Daniel . Goodman, 26, tells MailOnline of the town that consists of a gas . station, post office and two tiny general stores. ‘You shouldn’t be . ashamed of where you’re from no matter what.’ Despite her less than affluent upbringing, Jenna had a happy childhood. Jenna grew up in a modest doublewide trailer set on several acres of land. One neighbor tells MailOnline that the Kings are known as 'a nice family' around town. The well-kept mobile home has an open outdoor garage. Jane and Mike King own a practical car that is a far cry from the Mercedes Benz their daughter supposedly owned and drove around on Southern Charm. Dogs roam free on the property and loudly greet guests while several others live in a fenced-in kennel. A friend of the family tells MailOnline that Jenna’s mom Jane is a kind-hearted person who rescues stray animals. The King’s are so protective of their pets that they put out a sign warning drivers, ‘Old dog, young dog, several stupid dogs, please drive slowly.’ Student housing: Jenna lived in this one-story Saint Margaret Street rental in North Charleston while attending Trident Technical College. The modest three- bedroom home was far from the upscale historic townhouse used in the show . The Southern Charm star was a well-liked cheerleader at Lakewood High School, which had an average graduating class of 30 students. Jenna faced a 25-minute drive down quiet country roads to get here from her childhood home. ‘My cousin had a crush on her in high school and said she was real pretty and not shy at all,’ Wedgefield local Daniel Goodman tells MailOnline. Splish splash: Jenna was all wet when she said she paid for the Charleston house with her bank account . These days Jenna’s life is almost solely concentrated far away from South Carolina in Los Angeles. And since she recently confessed that she broke up with Lou, her 55-year-old New Yorker boyfriend many suggest was also her sugar daddy, Jenna’s taken to traveling around with Ronnie Radke, her new man and lead vocalist of Falling in Reverse. It now remains to be seen if Bravo will pick up Southern Charm for a second season — or if Jenna will return to spend more time in the Southern state she insists she loves. ‘We kind of figure people will always come back,’ Goodman says, adding that in Jenna’s case he isn’t so sure. ‘She’s scared of what she came from.’ Do you know who Lou is?

"By . Alison Boshoff . Published: . 17:01 EST, 13 December 2013 . Rags and riches: Lord Edward Somerset with his wife Lady Caroline Somerset at Mick Jagger's 50th birthday . What a happy, handsome couple they made on that hot July night 20 years ago. Lord Edward Somerset, the second son of the Duke of Beaufort, and his effervescent blonde wife Caroline were among the 250 revellers at Mick Jagger’s 50th birthday party in London. Blue-blood Lord Edward, known as Eddie, made a rather improbable French revolutionary, and his wife — a former deb who is the daughter of the late Viscount Davidson, deputy chief whip in Margaret Thatcher’s Cabinet — wore a towering white wig and came as Marie Antoinette. At the time they had not long returned from New York, where Eddie had run an art gallery. It was there he had met and befriended the Rolling Stones singer, and with his passion for music and playing the guitar, he fitted in well with Jagger and his friends, . Yet witness Eddie this week: frail, thin and ravaged by drugs, he is contemplating a financially painful divorce, and is threatened with jail. At Bristol Crown Court he admitted four counts of assaulting his wife over 21 years of their 30-year marriage. One left her requiring hospital treatment. The judge warned him a custodial sentence is possible. So what has happened to Eddie Somerset, second son of the 85-year-old, 11th Duke of Beaufort, worth an estimated £135 million, whose title was created in 1682 and whose family line dates from the Plantagenet kings of England in the 12th century? This is a family many consider to be posher than the ‘arriviste’ Windsors. Eddie always had pretensions towards a bohemian, rock ’n’ roll lifestyle, and was sent to £30,000-a-year Millfield School in Somerset. His elder brother, Harry, 61, known to all his friends as Bunter, is the Marquess of Worcester and heir to both the dukedom and the Badminton estate. He is married to eco-campaigner Tracy Ward, now Lady Worcester, although it is said that this marriage is also in disarray. The younger brother, Lord John ‘Johnson’ Somerset, works as a music producer and has collaborated with Bryan Ferry among others. He is divorced from the noted beauty Lady Cosima Vane-Tempest-Stewart, who was a close friend Princess Diana. There is also a sister, Anne ‘Monster’ Somerset, a historical biographer. The family all live on the immense and magnificent Badminton Estate, 22,500 acres in the heart of the Gloucestershire countryside. The game of badminton was invented there in 1863, it is the scene of the ultra-smart Badminton Horse Trials attended by Zara Phillips, and home of the Beaufort Foxhounds where Princes Charles, William and Harry have all ridden out in the past. Estate: The family's 22,500 acre Badminton House in the Gloucestershire countryside . Eddie Somerset married Caroline at . Badminton in 1982 and afterwards the young couple went to New York, . where Eddie worked in an art gallery part-owned by his father. New . York in the Eighties was awash with cocaine, and Eddie fell into druggy . circles. ‘It was a very hedonistic lifestyle,’ says a friend. Tellingly, . Eddie appointed shipping heir Constantine Niarchos as the godfather of . his first-born, Francesca, nicknamed Frankie, in 1984. Constantine, . known by the nickname ‘another line’, died in 1999 from a massive . cocaine overdose. He had taken 25 times more of the drug than would . normally be considered fatal. By then Eddie Somerset had developed a drug habit of his own. In 1986, he was named during the trial of Jamie Blandford for cocaine possession — his name appeared on a scrap of paper found at the house of Blandford’s dealer. The court heard Eddie Somerset had bought cocaine three times from the dealer. In May 1988, he checked into the Priory clinic in South-West London. By now he had left his job at his father’s art gallery and was described as a ‘rock keyboardist’. Case: Lord Edward Alexander Somerset arrives at Bristol Crown Court earlier this month . When he emerged, he and Caroline went to live in the exquisite Grade II-listed Essex House, which stands at the gates of Badminton. Did he ever kick hard drugs? There are doubts — the court heard drink and drugs were implicated in his attacks on his wife. Indeed, there is an expectation medical reports will be produced before he is sentenced which will suggest his chronic drug habit has left him in very poor physical shape. He has been assigned a probation officer, who will report to the court before sentencing in February. Caroline apparently started drinking heavily, too, and their relationship deteriorated — as one friend said, at times they would ‘bring out the worst in each other’. Caroline’s friends say that Eddie was a ‘compulsive and manipulative liar’, and the first of the admitted assaults came in 1990. The arrival of their second daughter, Rose, in 1992, should have improved things, but it failed to make the union any happier. At Bristol Crown Court this week Eddie’s behaviour was described as a long campaign of domestic violence.  Initially, he denied all charges — then admitted to four counts of assault. Another three charges will lie on file. Caroline’s injuries included bruising, scratches and hair-pulling in one attack. In another, it was bruising and a dislocated finger. In November 2011, the court heard she suffered a ‘deliberate and hard mis-aimed kick’. Friends say they have lived apart now for ‘a couple of years’ and it only came to court because Caroline ended up in hospital in October 2012. Hospital staff asked her how she’d been injured, and called police. From then on a prosecution was inevitable. Judge Mark Horton told the aristocrat the offences were so serious a prison term was possible and he is considering a restraining order to protect Caroline from him . The estranged couple have not seen each other for a year and divorce proceedings are underway. Edward’s lawyer, William Clegg QC, told the judge his client would not oppose a restraining order: ‘He accepts his marriage is completely over. He thinks it best that he have no contact with the complainant, and she has no contact with him.’ It might be because Eddie has been involved with a pretty blonde divorcee called Chloe Banks for some time. And it seems Caroline is still very upset over being replaced by Chloe. Chloe was married to events organiser Richard Banks, dividing her time between a splendid houseboat in Chelsea and his family estate in Herefordshire. Since that marriage ended, she has been flitting between a home in Ireland and, increasingly, the Badminton estate. Happy times: Edward and Caroline on their wedding day at Badminton House in 1982 . One friend said: ‘For some time now, Caroline has been living in West London and the marriage was drifting towards an end. However, Chloe is very much on the scene now, and has moved into Essex House. It has made Caroline very unhappy.’ He added: ‘Caroline is very glad the truth came out in court because the abuse and the violence had been going on for at least two years.’ The court heard that the family wanted her to drop the case in return for a financial settlement, but by then the CPS was involved and nothing could be done. ‘She says the liaison with Chloe has been going on for years. She feels Chloe has got what she wanted but will never be accepted like she was at Badminton, and that the duke loved her. She says Eddie and Chloe live together at Essex House, with Chloe sleeping in her old bedroom and they have thrown out her clothes.’ Caroline declined all offers of an interview this week, and is said to be trying to get on with her life. Yet the question remains: why did she stay for so long? Perhaps there was fear, shame and an unwillingness to go through a divorce. Possibly she feared its impact on the children. In court: Lady Caroline, pictured with her husband in 2008, was asked to drop the case in return for financial settlement . One friend explained: ‘She wasn’t strong enough to do anything about it. She really likes the family and particularly the duke. She was very loyal to him and as a result had reservations about going ahead with this.’ It must have been a relief when Eddie pleaded guilty, then, as there was dread on both sides about airing dirty linen in public. There was the possibility of Frankie, the eldest daughter, giving evidence. I’m told two butlers and a housekeeper would also have been called to testify, along with a number of upper-crust friends of the couple. After Christmas, Caroline plans to visit Frankie, who lives in Australia. She expects to be out of the country when her estranged husband is sentenced. Once the divorce is finalised, she plans to move on permanently. Currently, she is in what she calls ‘a small hovel in West Kensington’, but when Lord Eddie has made a settlement, she hopes to start a new life in Chelsea. Where Edward Somerset will be by then remains to be seen.","Lord Edward Somerset admits four counts of assault on wife Lady Caroline .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . Like many girls her age, Ellie, 12, from Lincolnshire, loves to attend a weekly drama group where she learns to dance and perform. The classes give the young girl a rare opportunity to act her age - as the rest of the time she has to take on responsibilities beyond her years by helping look after her ailing mother, Suzanne. Ellie explains: 'She can't walk without help, her hands . don't work, her head is on a tilt. As she has became worse she has . literally become a prisoner in her own bedroom. She hasn't seen the rest . of the house in over three months because it's so hard for her to get . down stairs.' Emotional support: Ellie does everything she can for her beloved mother, Suzanne, who has the terminal condition Multiple Systems Atrophy . Suzanne suffers from the rare and terminal condition . Multiple Systems Atrophy, a progressive neurological disorder. She has deteriorated over the last five years and is increasingly unable to do basic things . for herself such as washing and dressing. Her daughter remembers her as an active mother who used to love gardening and going to craft fairs. But since she has become unwell, their lives have been vastly different. Ellie said: 'I try and give her emotional support and make her feel nice about herself. Other girls my age do stuff with their mums like shopping and swimming but most of my time I spend going straight from my bed to her bed and spending most of my day there. It has become normal now.' She added: 'She used to run around everywhere after me and my brother, Ben. Now she can't even leave her room.' Obstacle: The stairs in Ellie's family home have made her mother a prisoner as it's too difficult for her to get up and down them . Ellie shares her story in a Channel 5 documentary which profiles three of the 250,000 children in the UK who care for a parent with a chronic illness or disability. Through the use of video diaries shot by . the children themselves, the programme gives a raw . insight into the everyday lives of these extraordinary families. The cameras follow Ellie as she auditions for a part in a musical to be staged by her drama club. She said the classes give her a chance to escape - although she can never really forget about her home life. 'I feel guilty being away from mum,' Ellie admits. 'I like to be there to cheer her up but she enjoys hearing what I have been up to.' Ellie reveals her father, William, also struggles with the turn their lives have taken. 'My dad never talks about how he feels he . just bottles it up,' she said. 'Dad is under a lot of pressure, he hasn't got anyone . to help in around the house and he has to deal with a lot of stuff with . mum. I worry about him. They have been married for 20 years, I don't know . if he'll survive and be ok in the end.' The family have been trying to move to a bungalow so it will be easier for Suzanne to get around. But they have to face the unbearable fact that she may not have long to live. 'She's not going to get better she's only going to get worse,' Ellie says through tears. 'There's no other way to put it, you can't sugar coat it.' Childhood with responsibilities: Madison cares for her mother Jade alongside trying to be an archery champion . She added: 'I don't know how long . she's got, it could be two months, it could be two years. I do . everything I can to try and make her happy but it's just a horrid . situation. It has taken all her dignity away, everybody has to do . everything for her, she can't do much for herself.' The programme also shares the story of Madison, a 13-year-old from Manchester who is a . talented archer with ambitions to represent her country. She juggles her . training with caring for her single mother, Jade, whose fibromyalgia means she is . often exhausted and in pain. Meanwhile, Jacob, is an 11-year-old boy . from Kent who has been looking after his mother, Julia, who has chronic arthritis and was left . virtually paralysed down one side after having an abscess removed from . her brain. Heartbreaking stories: Jacob, 11, also features in the documentary as he helps care for his mother, Julia, who has chronic arthritis . They reveal how much it hurts seeing their loved one in pain and feeling powerless to help. 'What did she do to deserve this? It's not like she's a criminal,' Ellie says of the unfairness of her mother's condition. Like Madison and Jacob, her mother's ill health has led to her having to grow up fast and she already has a wise head on her young shoulders. 'Lots of people take their parents for granted but you have to think deeper than that,' she explains. 'Always be thankful for what you have got, never take anything for granted because one day it might be all gone.' 12 Years Old and Caring for Mum: Through a Child's Eyes is on Channel 5 Thursday 3 July at 10pm .","Ellie, 12, from Lincolnshire, has to help care for her ill mother, Suzanne .

"By . Scarlett Russell . and Lucy Waterlow . Debt-ridden: Shelley MacKenney racked up £20,000k on credit cards and overdrafts and owed money to loan sharks . After racking up £20k in debt by the age of 22, a desperate young woman felt giving up her life and living on the streets was her only option. So one day in 2002, Shelley MacKenney caught the first coach she found leaving London and didn't look back. She left behind her grandmother, who had raised her in South London after her mother walked out on her at the age of three. Shelley's grandfather, father and grandmother were all involved at various stages of their life in criminal activity, forcing Shelley to grow up fast and become responsible for paying the bills and mortgage legally. She got a job at a bank but the seemingly readily available money at her fingertips led to her spiraling into debt. ‘I was available to everything on offer – cards, loans, overdrafts – and because I worked in the bank and had such good credit, more and more of them just kept on coming through my door and were never questioned,’ Shelley said when she appeared on yesterday's This Morning. 'Debt doesn’t just happen overnight. At first I was paying them all off but eventually, over time, the debts grew.' She showered her friends and family with presents and was oblivious to her outgoings. 'I took Nan shopping and bought takeaways for the whole family and spent hundreds of pounds on groceries - I always wanted to see the cupboards full of food because they weren't when I was younger,' she writes in a book of her experiences, called Missing. 'I wanted my family to have everything: my family who had known nothing but hardship, persecution and prosecution, who'd had nothing before. Now they could have everything and I'd pay for it. I was trying to prove that I could be useful.' But three years of overspending led to £200,000 of debt. 'By now I was using one credit card to pay off another,' she writes. She added that once the credit cards and overdrafts were maxed out, she had to seek other means to fuel her spending, going to dangerous loan sharks. She sank into depression and shopping became her only release and escapism - adding further to her debt. Scroll down for video . Escape: Shelley revealed on This Morning how she felt her only option was to disappear . With the loan sharks starting to threaten her with violence if she didn't pay them back, she resorted to stealling £1,000 from the bank where she worked. Guilt-ridden, she later confessed and lost her job, which caused her to sink deeper into depression. She even considered taking her own life. 'I didn't want to be alive anymore,' she confessed to  Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on This Morning. It was then Shelley decided to flee. She went to Victoria coach station, asked for a ticket to 'anywhere,' and ended up in Birmingham. Once there, Shelley became a missing person. She was so ashamed by her debts and overcome with depression – she wanted to forget her identity altogether. 'It's easy to disappear initially, but you have to work to stay under the radar,' she explained on This Morning. 'Every part of society is trying to bring you back in. You have a NI number. You have to become a non-person.' Desperate: She didn't know where to turn when her debts spiralled and she ended up on the streets of Birmingham (posed by model) Turned her life around: Now she's a proud mother and published author . For several months, Shelley spent time on the streets or in hostels, resorting to drastic measures to get by including conning men out of money by pretending to be interested in them. All this time, her grandmother had no idea what had become of her and Shelley didn't get in touch. She moved from place to place making it impossible for her to be tracked down. In trying to explain how she could leave her grandmother without even a note to explain her absence, Shelley says: 'I was so emotionally distraught and had gone through all the emotions you can think of before I left. By the time I did leave it was like I was numb. It was like the person before was dead. I couldn't feel anything anymore.' Shelley's memoir, Missing, published by Penguin, recounts her time living on the streets and in shelters and the dangers she encountered. Missing: Shelley has written a book on her experiences . She eventually changed her name by deed poll using legal aid and this enabled her to start signing on, open a bank account and get part-time work without fear of being discovered for who she really was. It was becoming a mother that finally made Shelley realise she couldn't keep running away from her old life. 'I didn't want to live on the streets anymore,' she says. 'I wanted her to have a proper upbringing,' she said of her daughter, Alyssia, who she fell pregnant with after a brief relationship with a man she met in a pub. Shelley went to a doctor and asked for help. They promptly put her in for counselling and she was supported by the Salvation Army. Eventually, she was ready to be reunited with her nan and her father and got back in touch with them. She now regrets running away from them for so long. She writes in her book: 'I need to say sorry to the people I walked away from. I can only imagine how they must have felt.' Now age 34 and a proud mother settled in Birmingham, Shelley now earns a living through book writing. She first helped her grandmother publish her story, Borstal Girl, and has now released her own memoir. She hopes sharing her story can help others. She advises people who get into debt to seek help and speak out rather than running away like she did. 'Always talk about what's gong on inside you. Don't keep it to yourself. I know it's hard and sometimes more difficult to talk to people you know than a stranger. But you are never alone, like I thought I was.' Shelley's book, Missing, was published this week to coincide with International Missing Children's Day, www.missingpeople.org.uk .","Shelley MacKenney spiralled into debt after working at a bank .

"By . Deni Kirkova . A beauty queen has had the last laugh after suffering bullies who called her fat and ugly throughout her teenage years. Danni De Bear, 21, from Dorchester, Dorset, is now a successful beauty queen but she endured horrific abuse at school and became so depressed she even considered taking her own life. The brunette was taunted for living on a farm - with bullies nicknaming her 'pig girl' and likening her to the animals her family kept. Danni on a charity walk (l) and at the Miss Fresh Face UK pageant held in Sandwich, Kent (r) Over an agonising period of six years Danni had food hurled at her on a daily basis and was locked in cupboards. And she says she would be constantly called fat and ugly to the point where she even began making herself sick in a bid to be thinner. But now she has learned to love herself after taking home the crown at a beauty pageant. 'I was made to feel so worthless that I started to believe that I was fat and ugly,' said Danni. 'I even started making myself sick for a few months when I was 14. I wanted to be anyone else but me. 'I thought about killing myself and I would cry every single day. I had no confidence whatsoever until I started doing the pageants. 'But I feel like a totally different person now. I never thought I'd ever do something like this all those years ago.' Carefree Danni aged three (l) and at 15, when she was called 'fat' and 'ugly' and became depressed (r) When she was 17, Danni's mum Tina, now 45, entered her into her first pageant. Despite being hesitant at first, Danni took part and saw her confidence soared almost overnight. 'I was terrified at first. My self-esteem was really low and when I walked out onto the stage I was shaking all over,' said Danni. 'I thought people would laugh at me or say I was too ugly to compete, but the crowd started cheering me straight away.' Danni, who works as a care worker with children and young adults with complex care needs, is currently Miss Fresh Face UK 2014, Miss Cyberface 2013 and Miss Charity for Face of Dorset. Once friendless and desperately self-conscious, Danni now travels the world and is asked for photographs by adoring fans. With boyfriend Lee at the Face of Dorset Competition (l) and at the Team England round for Miss European pageant (r) She said: 'I never thought that I'd be doing something like this in a million years. 'You feel like a celebrity when the crowd are shouting and screaming for you - it's the most amazing feeling.' And since finding love with scaffolder boyfriend Lee Millington, 29, three months ago, life has never been better for Danni. She said: 'Lee comes to watch me at the pageants and he told my mum that seeing me on the stage takes his breath away. 'The bullies made me want to be someone else but now I'm finally happy in my own skin.'

"By . Deni Kirkova . A brand new grocery store complete with everyday goods such as fruit, milk and biscuits has just opened in London. So far, so run-of-the-mill, right? But everything is not as it might at first appear: those purchasing perishables for dinner will be disappointed - as everything's made from felt. The Cornershop, in Bethnal Green, east London, is the brainchild of large-scale artist Lucy Sparrow. The pop-up shop features everything from huggable ready meals and squeezable confectionery to stitched felt newspapers, ice lollies and oven chips - and even a felt pricing gun. Artist Lucy Sparrow outside The Cornershop in Bethnal Green which she has stocked with felt goods . The 28-year-old from London painstakingly stitched together an incredible 3,944 items over a seven-month period - requiring more than a quarter of a million stitches. Lucy said: 'I've always made big things. I like coming up with huge projects where the result is bigger than me and it takes over my life. 'I'm very obsessive and I want that to come across in the work and get people thinking 'Who would be crazy enough to do this?' 'I like getting up at the crack of dawn and beavering away at something, knowing that so many other people are still asleep. 'The felt shop was born out of a desire to make an exhibition that was so all-encompassing that when everyone came in they were just blown away by the extent of the work, the labour involved.' The 28-year-old painstakingly stitched together an incredible 3,944 items over a seven month period . Those purchasing perishables for dinner will be disappointed - as everything's made from felt . Bath-born Lucy took to crowdfunding site Kickstarter with the aim of raising £2,000 to create her corner shop - but ended up generating more than £10,500. She also managed to secure funding from the Arts Council - and a sponsorship deal with sweets manufacturer Swizzels. The sewing enthusiast only began work on the shop in January 2014, and admits to occasionally feeling overwhelmed by the volume of produce she was committed to making. She added: 'It was incredibly daunting. I remember planning out the making schedule at the beginning of February and it didn't allow for a rest until the October 1. 'There were so many nights where I would wake up in a cold sweat feeling guilty and panicked that I hadn't made enough that day. 'I fell asleep with pieces of half-stitched felt food a lot of the time. But I never felt like giving up, amazingly. However, there were periods of extreme fatigue where I just felt like I could sleep for weeks. 'I think I have multivitamins and takeaways to thank for getting everything completed.' Various brands of biscuits and lager sit on the shelves at artist Lucy Sparrow's felt corner shop . Lucy with a basket full of felt goods and behind the counter . The shop will be open throughout the month of August, with prices varying from £3 for a felt cigarette lighter to £840 for the store's till - the most expensive item on display. Visitors to the exhibition will be able to reserve items using an order sheet and can then come and collect them or have them mailed out at the end of the month when the shop closes. And Lucy admits to mixed emotions when it comes to selling off her vast stockpile of felt goods. 'I think it will be hard to let go of all the things I've made, but in a way I need them to go, I've got no space in my house. 'They've become a big part of my life over the last eight months. It's been really overwhelming, but I want them to go out into the world. I want people to have them and enjoy them as much as I have. 'The beauty of this project is that all the products are very affordable pieces of art that anyone can own and that was the intention all along. 'I still feel incredibly honoured that people want to have something I've made on display in their home.' For more information visit thecornershoponline.com .

She finished her outfit with a complementing hat, which was adorned with a peacock feather.

'I never noticed Freddie's resemblance to Prince George until I saw all the TV coverage during their recent visit to Australia and New Zealand. George was dressed in clothes similar to those Freddie wears and they seem to have the same temperament. 'Like George, Freddie moves around by himself although he's skipped the crawling and has gone straight to trying to walk, and just like the Prince, if he isn't doing what he wants, has a very cute pouty, sulky face. 'He's also obsessed by our family dog Minnie, just like George appears to be with Lupo. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George in New Zealand .

Rebecca Brown, 21, from Chelmsford, Essex, blogs about life with trichotillomania and published a six-and-a-half year time-lapse video on her YouTube channel last year. Extensive news coverage caused the views to soar by around 3 million in just a couple of weeks, and the comments section flood with fan mail. Scroll down for video . Rebecca Brown, 21, from Chelmsford, Essex, blogs about life with trichotillomania . Whenever Rebecca was stressed or upset when she was growing up she would play with her hair for comfort. By the time she was 16 her habit had escalated into a full-blown psychological disorder - which left her almost completely bald. Doctors . failed to diagnose the condition for five years, simply telling her to . stop being a fidget. Meanwhile at school she endured cruel taunts and . nasty looks from her classmates. Feeling lost and alone, she started . taking a photograph of herself every day, chronicling her experiences on . the internet in a blog and in YouTube videos with brutal honesty. In her most-viewed clip she chronicles six-and-a-half years of her life with 2,100 selfies. The four-minute video shows Rebecca in the depths of depression with . sullen eyes and picking at her skin, and in the highs of health with a . glowing complexion and a wide smile. To . her utter surprise the response was overwhelming - and to her delight . it was supportive. As a result of her videos, Rebecca, pictured in 2012, has a large group of fans and supporters . Her honestly and bravery is clearly inspiring, with comments such as this posted from a . supporter: 'Wow I just watched this and it really touched me. Well . done! You're an inspiration :) I hope you keep pushing forward and I . wish you all the best!﻿' For . others, the video touched their lives in a much more personal way. A . father whose daughter has the condition wrote: 'That's lovely, Becky! I . just showed this to my 13 year old to let her see what kinds of changes . are in store for her in the next seven years.' A fellow sufferer . added: 'I have been suffering from the same nervous disorder for almost . twenty years now. Words cannot express how I feel finding your video. Maybe that I am less alone.  Thank you for speaking out! <3'﻿ . Rebecca has become a heroine to thousands of other sufferers of . trichotillomania, a disorder characterised by the uncontrollable urge to . pluck out the hair, usually from the scalp but also sometimes eyebrows . and eyelashes. Rebecca, pictured in 2009, published a six-and-a-half year time-lapse video on her YouTube channel last year . Extensive news coverage caused the views to soar by around 3 million in just a couple of weeks . And it must be taking up most of her time getting back to all these people. Back in November Rebecca confessed she receives so much fan mail . online it takes her three hours a week to reply to it all - and that she was even . mobbed by fans when she attended a conference on the condition in the . US. She said: ‘I get a lot of post from people who confide in me about their . trichotillomania, yet they haven’t told their family or friends. I feel . very blessed that people trust me like that.’ Rebecca played with hair obsessively as a child and began pulling out . clumps when she was a teenager. She said: ‘I started going to the doctor . about it when I was 13 but they didn’t diagnose it until 18. Before I . was diagnosed, doctors advised me to do all sorts of silly things. One . doctor told me to stop fidgeting and another told me to sit on my hands. Rebecca believes that posting the videos on the internet has aided her recovery . ‘Some . people say trichotillomania is a result of childhood trauma but for me, . pulling my hair has been a comfort thing. I do it a lot when I am . stressed or upset. ‘A lot . of people at school and college didn’t understand why I was going bald. Lots of people mockingly called me ""baldie"". But it was the horrible . looks that I got from other kids that was the worst thing.’ At one point . she had so little hair she shaved her head to make herself feel better; . at other times she wore wigs. By . the time she was 14 she decided to find out for herself what was . happening to her. She did an internet search for ‘hair pulling’ and . discovered what trichotillomania was. Rebecca said: ‘All that came up in the search . results were three not-so-brilliant videos on the disorder. ‘I . decided to upload my own, no-holds-barred video.' In some photos, she . wrote the name of her disorder on her forehead in marker pen with an . arrow pointing to her last remaining bristles as she attempted to . explain the condition to the outside world. Rebecca believes that . posting the videos on the internet has aided her recovery. 'I have . found it hard to speak to councillors but it has always felt easy to . talk to a webcam,' she said. A . spokesman for Trichotillomania Support said: ‘It is important that . sufferers know they are not alone and they should not be ashamed of . asking for support.’ Information and help can be found on Trichotillomania Support's website trichotillomania.co.uk .","Rebecca Brown, 21, has trichotillomania, the compulsive urge to pull hair .

Josie Cunningham, pictured, had originally planned to sell footage of the birth of her third child on DVDs through a nationwide chain of pound shops but she later revealed to her fans on Twitter the deal had fallen through . Now, she has told her followers on Twitter that she has sold four tickets to fans who will have  ringside seats . Three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'. Two were sold for £10,000 each while the other two sold for £5,000 each. Ms Cunningham said all tickets include travel and accommodation while the more expensive ones will allow the ticket holder to film the birth and take photos. On social media, reaction to the latest publicity stunt has been almost universally negative with commentators criticising her decision to make money from the birth of her child. One Twitter user,posed the question that it was the British public who shared the blame for her fame as they have made Ms Cunningham 'a viable commodity'. However, Ms Cunningham has suggested that some of the cash from the event could be used to reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery. Ms Cunningham, 23, from Leeds, became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD. She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. Later it emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'. Commentators on Twitter were particularly critical of Ms Cunningham's latest moneymaking idea . Ms Cunningham's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting the son she is due to give birth to in October because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. The mother-of-two later she she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. Eventually Leeds City Council decided to axe the service which prompted Ms Cunningham to Tweet: ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones but taxpayers will always fund me.’ Later she said: 'If the council think I’m getting a bus, they can think again.' Now she is hoping to make £40,000 from the birth of her third child by allowing four fans to witness the event. In the aftermath of the school taxi controversy, Cunningham claimed the taxpayer would always fund her . Initially, Ms Cunningham had planned to cash in on the birth of her son by selling DVDs of the event through a chain of pound shops. Ms Cunningham has even involved herself in the debate surrounding the death of Peaches Geldof. She accused the daughter of former Boomtown Rat Bob and Paula Yates of being a bad mother. She told her Twitter followers: 'Really irritates me that the same trolls sending me s**t since the abortion story are STILL defending peaches!! (sic)' Ms Cunningham said she was going to take to Twitter tonight at 9pm in order to allow her fans to ask her questions directly on any subject. However, during previous question and answer sessions, the heavily pregnant model received some serious abuse. Ms Cunningham, pictured, said she will be on Twitter at 9pm this evening to answer questions from her fans .","Wannabe model Josie Cunningham has sold four ringside seats to the birth .

"By . Eleanor Harding . Her flawless beauty has earned her worldwide fame. But it seems even Cara Delevingne cannot escape the ruthless swipe of the airbrush, if this photograph is anything to go by. The supermodel appears to have been digitally enhanced in this fashion shoot for lingerie brand, La Perla. Scroll down for video . Body overhaul: Cara's bust has been boosted, her bottom and thighs made curvier, and her pale white skin has been bronzed with lots of fake tan for the La Perla campaign, and seen right on holiday in December . The 21-year-old’s bust seems to have been enlarged a cup size, while her usually pearly white skin has been bronzed. Gone too are her famous tattoos - most notably the one underneath her chest bearing the song lyrics, ‘Don’t worry, be happy’. The phrase, which is also the title of Bobby McFerrin’s 1988 hit single, was spotted on the model when holidayed in Barbados last month. According to reports, Cara was given a warning from her modelling agency to stay away from the tattoo chair but she has defied their wishes. Among the other seven tattoos on her body are the name of her mother Pandora on the inside of her left elbow, her initials CJD on her hand, and a constellation of stars around her ear. None of these are visible in her La Perla shoot. Currently the face of Burberry, Miss Delevingne, has admitted she ‘can’t stop’ adding more tattoos. Her latest shoot for La Perla comes just five months after H&M reportedly axed her following the emergence of pictures in which she is seen dropping a bag of white powder outside her London flat.","Even Cara Delevingne cannot escape the ruthless swipe of the airbrush .

"By . Chris Leadbeater . There can be all manner of reasons to take a long journey – a desire to expand one’s horizons; a need to re-charge the batteries; an irresistible case of wanderlust. But for Derek Cullen, his current odyssey has a rather more poignant reason. A man with a remarkable plan: Derek Cullen decided to cycle across the whole length of Africa after losing both his parents to cancer . Still a long way to go: His journey has already taken him through seven African countries - and will carry him through three more . The 32-year-old Dubliner is midway through a monumental jaunt that was inspired – if that’s the correct word – by the death of both his parents. Mr Cullen lost both his mother and father to cancer ‘a few years ago’ – and came to the conclusion that life is too short to waste being ‘crippled by fear and anxieties.’ Looking ahead: Derek Cullen began his odyssey in November, at False Bay on the lower shoreline of South Africa, near Cape Town . Nothing but the two wheels beneath him: Derek's vehicle for his grand odyssey is a simple road bike . His response? To plan, and then set off on a trip across Africa, using pedal power alone – and raise money for a children’s cancer charity at the same time. ‘I lost both parents to cancer a few years ago, which brought me to fully realise how short life is,” he explains. ‘As a result, I began questioning whether I was actually doing what I wanted in life. The answer to this question was a very sobering thought. The freedom of the open road: Derek has embarked on his epic adventure to raise money for a children's charity . Careful where you put your wheels: There have been a few animal encounters along the way - with creatures both large and small . ‘It got to the point where I was fed up living a life crippled by fear and anxieties. 'But rather than accept it, I decided to do something about it.’ The idea of travelling from one end of Africa to the other by bicycle was, he says, an immediately intriguing one – giving him a chance to see a continent in detail. ‘The simplicity of the bicycle appealed the most,’ he says. Moments of levity: Although the language barrier has proved an issue, Derek has enjoyed plenty of interaction with local people . A laugh along the way: Derek has taken to explaining to bemused passers-by that he has 'run out of diesel' ‘I figured it would mean having to visit and stay in remote villages that would normally be bypassed by other transport.’ He began his journey in November, starting out from Strandfontein – a beachside suburb of Cape Town which sits due east of South Africa’s most famous city, on False Bay. Have to stop, need a rest: A break for a snooze in the convenient shade of a roadside tree . Putting down temporary roots: A tent is one of Derek Cullen's few luxuries as he bids to cycle from South Africa to Egypt . His route initially took him due north, through South Africa and on into Namibia. Here, a sharp right turn helped him to avoid troubled Angola and enter Botswana. From here, he rolled north-east through Zambia and Malawi, before swerving north again and cycling through the wildlife-rich countries of Tanzania and Kenya. Making the best of it: A rainy day and an encounter with children using a rudimentary - but effective - type of umbrella . Tough going: As well as scorching temperatures, Derek has cycled through rain storms and extreme downpours . He is currently in the Kenyan capital Nairobi. He plans to continue north through Ethiopia and Sudan, before concluding his grand tour on the shore of the Mediterranean in Egypt. Fending off the heat: A desperate bid to cool down under the unforgiving African sun . Really starting to feel it: The effort involved in pedalling under the African sun is all too visible in this revealing image . The journey, unsurprisingly, has thrown up a few challenges – with solitude proving to be as much of an issue as the physical exertion. ‘It's hard being alone and being a “stranger” all the time,’ Mr Cullen continues. ‘The constant language barrier means it is mostly impossible to find stimulating conversation.’ Take care: Derek's route has taken him through fabled wildlife-rich countries such as Botswana, Kenya and - in this photo - Tanzania . Plenty to look at: A close encounter with an elephant on the road through Botswana . However, he has stumbled across a joke that seems to be widely amusing. When asked by puzzled passers-by where he is going and why he is doing it by bicycle, he has taken to replying that he has ‘run out of diesel’. No need for petrol: This gas station in Tanzania appears to be closed - but this is of no matter to our brave cyclist . I can't believe you're doing this: Plenty of people have been receptive to what Derek is trying to achieve . Mr Cullen is writing about his adventures at nohangingaround.com. Here, readers can also donate to his chosen charity, Aoibheanns Pink Tie. ‘I see the trip as a platform to take on further adventures and encourage others to start making the changes that I myself was so afraid to make,’ he says. On a line of latitude: A major moment during Derek's journey as he crosses the equator in Kenya . Into the sunset: Derek hopes to conclude his journey in Egypt later this year .","Derek Cullen is currently in Kenya, midway through a journey that will take him from one end of Africa to the other .

"By . Sarah Michael . Eating plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables and whole grains helps prevent people from developing more than one chronic disease, new medical research shows. The world-first research conducted by the University of Adelaide examined the link between diet and 11 chronic diseases, including anemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, arthritis, hepatitis, coronary heart disease, asthma, stroke, fracture and cancer. It found that people who eat a higher amount of fruit are less likely to develop any chronic disease, while a high intake of vegetables helps prevent people with one chronic disease from developing a second. Scroll down to see video . People who eat a higher amount of fruit are less likely to develop any chronic disease, new research from the University of Adelaide shows . The study, done in conjunction with universities and health organisations in China and Canada, is published in the Clinical Nutrition journal. Healthier people eat more grains other than wheat and rice ¿ such as oats, corn, sorghum, rye, barley, millet and quinoa . While links between good diet and disease prevention are well established, this is the first study that had linked poor nutrition to the development of multiple chronic diseases, otherwise known as 'multimorbidity'. The researchers studied more than 1000 Chinese people over a five-year period. Study co-author Dr Zumin Shi said the participants who did not develop any chronic disease ate on average 57 grams of fruit per day – a relatively small amount by Australian standards. 'Chinese consumption of fruit is quite low, but even when low you can see the benefits,' Dr Shi told MailOnline. Dr Shi added that rice intake was significantly lower in the healthy group. 'This could be because rice is mainly refined and deprived of the benefits associated with fibres, and the kinds of phytochemicals that you find in whole grains,' he said. The research also found that healthier participants ate more grains other than wheat and rice – such as oats, corn, sorghum, rye, barley, millet and quinoa. The world-first research examined the link between diet and 11 chronic diseases, including anemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, arthritis, hepatitis, coronary heart disease, asthma, stroke, fracture and cancer . Dr Shi said these grains were less likely to be refined and are therefore likely to contain more dietary fibre. 'If you look at the intake of whole grains, the highest intake of whole grains is among those who stay healthy over five years,' Dr Shi said. The study highlighted the role of micronutrients in protecting against disease. 'A higher daily intake of iron, magnesium, phosphorous, vitamin C, potassium and vitamin B1 was associated with healthier participants,' Dr Shi said. This is the first study that had linked poor nutrition to the development of multiple chronic diseases, otherwise known as 'multimorbidity'","People who eat lots of fruit are less likely to develop any chronic disease .

Mr Huang said he had always believed in UFOs and the photos only strengthened his theory. 'Maybe in the future we will take more photos there to see if there is anything in them,' he said. Australian Skeptics UFO spokesman Steve Roberts said photos featuring UFO-like objects were usually the result of a 'lens flare' from a source of light.

"By . Sarah Michael . and Aap . Australian teenager Nick Kyrgios has staged the performance of his life, mounting an incredible comeback to upset French 13th seed Richard Gasquet in a Wimbledon classic. Kyrgios, at 19 the youngest man in the draw,  came from two sets down and saved nine match points over four successive games in the final set before clinching victory 3-6, 6-7 (7-4), 6-4, 7-5, 10-8. 'It was an unbelievable match out there,' Kyrgios said.

No player has saved nine match points and gone on to win a grand slam match in a decade, while it hasn't happened at Wimbledon since 1966. Ranked 144th in the world, Kyrgios (pronounced Keer-ios) earned a wildcard entry to the grass court grand slam after winning a Challenger event in Nottingham earlier this month.

He faced match points in the fourth but held off Gasquet 7-5 before a stunning decider. At 4-5 down, Kyrgios appeared to have double faulted on match point but was spared by the narrowest of Hawkeye rulings and he ultimately pulled off a remarkable win, taking the fifth 10-8. Gasquet, who like Kyrgios was once heralded as a future Grand Slam winner, said: ‘He is playing incredible. We all knew his potential. ‘I am sad because I lost nine match points.

An end to carousel woe? The GPS tags would let passengers check the whereabouts of their bags . But . help is at hand for every passenger who has ever had to make a frantic . dash to the shops to buy emergency clothing, or endured a long argument . with airline staff: the 'intelligent' baggage tag which knows where it – . and your suitcase – is at all times. European air giant Air France-KLM is currently working on tags that would use GPS (Global Positioning System) and Bluetooth technology to keep track of a bag’s location. This means that the whereabouts of a suitcase that has missed its connection could be pinpointed immediately – or that lost luggage could even become a thing of the past. The tags would also help guard against the problem of bags being delivered correctly, but stolen before passengers caught up in passport-control queues can retrieve them. Manuel van Lijf of Air France-KLM thinks that the tags could revolutionise air travel – and envisages the devices being rolled out by all airlines in the near future. ‘We have worked closely with our suppliers and with [US airline] Delta to try to make this an industry initiative, not just an airline initiative,’ he told Future Travel Experience. ‘We thought it would be useless to just develop something for us. ‘We wanted to develop something that will benefit the industry and the passengers. ‘The idea was to create a product that can be used by a passenger flying with Air France, KLM, Delta, Lufthansa or another airline,’ he continued. ‘Why would a passenger buy a permanent tag that can only be used on one airline?’ The tags are still in development, but the airline aims to start trials by the end of the year. A small group of passengers could be testing the devices by as soon as December. Not lost anymore: The tags are still in development, but could be in use by the end of this year . Two types of tag are in development. The ‘eTag’ is a visible label which would be attached to the outside of the bag, and would communicate using Bluetooth. The ‘eTrack’ would be placed inside a suitcase, and would operate via GPS as well as Bluetooth – and could be traced by a passenger’s smartphone. In theory, travellers would be able to check on the status and location of their bags throughout their journey – with, for example, the fact that their luggage has been checked-in registering on their phone within five seconds of the process’s completion. Air France-KLM is not the only company experimenting with this concept. Bag manufacturer Samsonite is working on a ‘Track & Trace’ range, which would also allow passengers to keep an electronic eye on their luggage.","European air giant is developing luggage tags that can be tracked remotely .

"By . Chris Leadbeater . For many visitors, New Orleans can be little more than an excuse for a party. Like Las Vegas with a soul (and a good deal more history), the biggest city in Louisiana is certainly a place to visit if you fancy a rowdy time. Late-night revellers spill out of the never-knowingly-closed bars on the notorious drag of Bourbon Street, and on its kindred spirits Decatur and Chartres Streets. And if you arrive in the city during the annual Mardi Gras festivities (usually in February), you might wonder if you have happened upon wild celebrations to mark the end of the world – complete with fancy dress and a lot of drink. Evocative: Photographer Frank Relle captures a side of New Orleans rarely seen by tourists - quiet back streets and suburban avenues . For . other visitors, The Big Easy is about other things – the glorious . architecture of the French Quarter, with its 18th century homes – all . curved iron balconies and echoes of the colonial era; the rare . prettiness of Jackson Square, where the St Louis Cathedral harks back to . 1789; the chance to hear jazz in the spiritual home of the genre, . perhaps in the hallowed confines of Preservation Hall, or in any of the . many other musical speakeasies dotted around the centre; the liquid . majesty of the River Mississippi as it shapes the city. But . few of the millions who flock to New Orleans every year look beyond the . attractions and well-thumbed sites at its heart. And few truly peer . into the suburbs and outer areas that make up the majority of the . metropolis – where dimly lit streets are lined with Southern Oak and . Cypress trees, and mansions share the grid with tumbledown shacks. This is the world caught on camera by Frank Relle (www.frankrelle.com). A kaleidoscope of colour: Relle deals in images taken low to the ground, offering an unusual angle and an amplified sense of atmosphere . Born . and based in New Orleans, he specialises in atmospheric images that depict his home city away from the noisy hubbub of the French Quarter . and Café du Monde. He learned his trade in New York, but found that the best subject was closer to his heart. ‘I went to New York to find photography, but lost it in the bright lights and darkrooms,’ he says. ‘I . came home to New Orleans. 'On meditative nightly drives behind the wheel . of my grandmother’s 1986 Lincoln Town Car, I discovered a new way to . see. Scars of the past: The red markings on the house on the right date back to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina - and show that the property was checked for survivors . Far from the French Quarter: New Orleans is home to some of the most deprived urban areas in the United States, and some of its homes demonstrate this . ‘Low to the ground, that wide old windshield provided the best viewfinder I’ve ever used.’ His photographs look back at New Orleans over the last decade. ‘Shot . from 2004 to the present, the photographs are lit to capture the mood . from that same [low-angle] perspective,’ he explains. ‘The images leave . room for the viewers’ interpretations, and for a cast of characters to . take position in the foreground.’ New Orleans was, of course, infamously hit by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The . winds brought flooding and disaster to many areas of the city, causing . death and despair, with thousands losing their homes. In some places, . New Orleans has still not recovered from the terrible damage it suffered, . with abandoned houses being left to rot. Relle’s . camera takes in these scars on the cityscape as well as the avenues . that sing sweetly of French settlers, Southern belles and mint juleps on . woozy afternoons. Left to the elements: In this image, Relle's camera focuses on an abandoned property on Clouet Street, in the Bywater neighbourhood of New Orleans . Romantic: Relle also captures the side of New Orleans that lingers in many imaginations - including, in this case, Chestnut Street, which runs elegantly through Touro . Out on the edges: New Orleans is famously framed by water, with the Mississippi curling through its heart, and Lake Pontchartrain sitting directly to the north . Given to the wild: A beautiful snapshot of a home lost to the verdant landscape of Louisiana, on Telemachus Street, west of the centre . Pretty green: A moody moment on Vallette Street, which sits on the far side of the Mississippi in the Algiers Point district, and feels a world away from the French Quarter . Far beyond Mardi Gras: There is more to New Orleans than the parties and bars of Bourbon Street - as these snaps of Tonti and Prieur Streets demonstrate . Stepping into focus: Frank Relle places himself in front of the camera for one brief image - but usually lets his lens take in a city that is rarely less than visually striking .","Photographer Frank Relle specialises in dramatic, moody images that capture the twilight side of his home city .

"By . Toni Jones . Blonde mega model Cara Delevingne has the biggest brows in the business, but today her famous facial furniture was well kept hidden as she hit the catwalk in Milan. Walking for Italian fashion house Fendi on day one of the city's fashion week the 21-year-old British model strutted down the runway in a tomato-red shift dress and black basin-cut wig. The unforgiving hairpiece would have swamped lesser models, but Cara worked the beatnik look like a true pro, proof that she really can make anything look good. Cara Delevingne walks the runway wearing a scruffy black wig during the Fendi show as a part of Milan Fashion Week Womenswear . Fellow British model Georgia May Jagger was also part of the luxury label's spring/summer show. The short, sombre wig accentuated her mega pout and drew comparisons between the 21-year-old and her rockstar father Mick Jagger. Cara recently starred in a short film for Fendi, shot by creative director and industry heavyweight Karl Lagerfeld on the outskirts of Rome. The spooky seven minute film stars fellow model Saskia de Brauw and fashion muse Amanda Harlech and sees Cara playing the character of a doe-eyed and vulnerable girl - a far cry from her usual funny face antics. According to Vogue.co.uk Cara's desire to pursue an acting career is no secret - she recently . landed her first leading role in British film Kids In Love, and also . played a small part in the most recent cinema adaptation of Anna . Karenina, alongside Keira Knightley and Aaron Taylor-Johnson.

"By . Chris Leadbeater . For many of us, it is the sort of challenge that you might attempt once in your life – a brief throwing of caution to the winds; a bucket-list box ticked, perhaps never to be repeated. But for one undoubtedly brave – and perhaps reckless – British adventurer, bungee jumping comes so easily that he decided to do it 151 times. In a single day. A man with a crazy plan: Colin Phillips has time to smile for the camera as he forges out on his world record bid . And then he was gone: Phillips heads towards terra firma as he ticks off another leap from above . Colin Phillips performed his repeated game of chicken with gravity in Dubai, as part of an attempt to break the world record for the number of jumps in a 24-hour period. And he achieved his aim, smashing the previous high-water mark of 105, which was set by South African daredevil Kevin Huntly - at the Bloukrans Bungy Bridge, on South Africa’s famous Garden Route - in May 2011. Mr Phillips is based in Dubai, and pulled off his feat by leaping from a 100-metre crane at a bungee facility, Gravity Zone. This is attached to the Dubai Autodrome, a race-track where adrenaline junkies can drive fast cars amid the dust and sand of the desert emirate. Prepare for lift-off: Phillips was attempting to break the previous high mark for the number of bungee jumps in one day, 105, set in South Africa three years ago . All downhill from here: Phillips ticked off a remarkable 151 bungee jumps over three different sessions during his 24-hour challenge . The 33-year-old split his earthbound tumbles into three sessions. He began on the evening of (Thursday) 20 March, jumping from 7pm until 11pm. Then, after resting for seven hours, he recommenced at 6am on the Friday morning, continuing until 10.30am. By 10.20am, he had beaten the record, pushing it up by one to 106 – but was not content to leave it at this figure. A further session of rest over lunchtime saw him remount the jumping platform for a final burst of rapid descents, between 3pm and the cut-off point at 7pm. Record broken, let's do some more: Phillips set a new high mark with plenty of time to spare - before adding 46 to the prior top total . Perhaps unsurprisingly, the process left Mr Phillips feeling exhausted. ‘I feel a bit beaten up, to be honest,’ he told The National. ‘Every jump has been different. Sometimes it’s a good one, sometimes it’s not so good.’ Due to the stresses placed on his body by so many leaps in quick succession, Mr Phillips was forced regularly to change the position of his safety harness, transferring it between his ankles and his chest. The ankles tend to be the standard point of attachment in bungee-jump procedure, but staff on hand deemed it necessary to make the switch. All smiles, no injuries: Apart from a dislocated finger and a sore body, Phillips achieved his target without any medical concerns . ‘It’s mostly to stop my ankles from . being completely ripped to shreds,’ Mr Phillips explained. ‘Neither [of . the harness positions] are easier, you’re still getting the same force . and sustained pressures on the body.’ He did suffer one small injury – dislocating his finger after catching it in his harness, requiring the assistance of a sports therapist, who quickly clicked the errant digit back into place. But he was not affected by migraines or dizziness – two unpleasant consequences that could have resulted from so many head-long rushes towards terra firma. Circles in the sand: Phillips attempted his record at the Dubai Autodrome, a popular race track in the desert emirate . Mr Phillips achieved his target with a considerable amount of time to spare. In total, he jumped for less than 12 hours, settling for a final total of 151. He had hoped to break the 200-jump barrier, but found that tiredness hindered his efforts. That figure was verified by an official from Guinness World Records – which now has an office in Dubai, due to the number of world-record bids that are now attempted in a place where biggest, fastest, highest and most have become cherished mantras. Big boys' toy: Dubai is no stranger to great heights and world records, thanks to the towering presence of the Burj Khalifa skyscraper, the tallest building on the planet . ‘The office was opened here because demand was so high for record-breaking events,’ said Samer Khallouf, the Guinness adjudicator who monitored the attempt. The Burj Khalifa, which opened in Dubai in 2010, is, of course, the tallest building in the world, reaching into the heavens at a height of 830 metres (2722ft).","Dubai-based Briton takes on the world record for the highest number of bungee jumps performed in 24-hour period .

"By . Chris Leadbeater . The bus tour of a city is one of the great clichés of travel. And perhaps one of the most dreary ways to see a major metropolis. You plonk yourself on a seat by the window, and listen to an unenthusiastic guide drone on about some monument or other, in a voice that says they’ve done this spiel about a thousand times before. Which, of course, they have. But there is nothing dreary – and certainly nothing clichéd – about the new bus tour which is set to bring drama, and just a hint of danger, to the streets of Tokyo. More than your average tour: Tokyo is now offering the 'Samurai and Ninja Safari' Feel the pain: Costumed actors will stage battles between samurai warriors and ninjas as part of the tour . Tourists who like their travel to come with a little flair can now book themselves onto a ‘Samurai and Ninja Safari’ jaunt around the Japanese capital – a one-hour itinerary that involves flying fists and roars of pain as costumed figures throw themselves into combat. Launched by JTB – Japan’s biggest bus tour operator – in conjunction with an events company SGRS, the ‘safari’ will offer visitors a taste of Japanese history that goes far beyond a dusty map in a museum, or a quick docu-film on the country’s military past. Fleet-footed: 'Fights' will take place outside the bus, with tourists able to look on from the safety of their seats . Stealthy living: The tour will attempt to bring Japan's medieval history to life for a modern generation . The first half of the tour will be a standard route through some of Tokyo’s key areas. But once the bus enters Asakusa – a part of the city famed for its temples and visible heritage – things will get a little feisty. And, if you will, a little 'fisty'. Street performers dressed as both samurais and ninjas will burst out of the shadows and leap into battle, assailing each other with a range of acrobatic kicks and athletic blows. Parts will be played by actors from the Tokyo pantomime group Gabez. Have some of that: Samurais were the knights of 16th century Japan, and carried the traditional katana sword . In your face, mate: Ninjas were covert figures - though there is nothing too covert about this fight here . Tourists will look on from the bus as the action unfolds outside. The organisers hope that the idea will prove popular with visitors who want a little more from their sight-seeing. ‘It’s theatre in motion,’ says Kazuhiro Kumade of SGRS. ‘As the samurai and ninja battle in Asakusa, passengers can enjoy it from inside the bus.’ The best tickets for the tour – seats with the clearest views – will cost around £40. The tour is not entirely unprecedented. New York currently offers a trip called The Ride, which runs on a similar basis – with theatrical performances taking place along the route. Scream if you want to see more: The 'fights' will take place in the streets of Tokyo's Asakusa district . There's more where that came from: The tour is described by its organisers as 'theatre in motion' Ninjas and samurai are a fundamental part of Japanese history. Samurai warriors were the Japanese equivalent of the knights of medieval Europe – guided by a strict code of conduct, and clad in thick suits of armour, usually made of iron or leather, bound by small straps. In the 16th century, many of them carried the katana – the traditional curved sword which has become a recognisable symbol of Japanese lore. Ninjas, by contrast, were covert figures – mercenaries and spies who were allowed to operate between the rules, their effectiveness based on stealth and invisibility.

"By . Chris Leadbeater . With its five terminals, endless flurry of travellers and busy skies, many people assume that London’s Heathrow hub is the most visited airport on the planet. Scroll Down for Video . Crowded skies: The new figures show that 5.4 billion people travelled by air in 2013 . But according to new figures released today, the UK capital’s biggest air terminus is only third on the global list of the world’s busiest airports. The statistics, which use passenger numbers as the key gauge of an airport’s importance, show that Heathrow had 72 million passengers in 2013 – a rise of 3.3 per cent on 2012. But this was easily eclipsed by Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in the southern US city of Atlanta – which retained its position as the planet’s busiest air hub. A crucial connection airport for . travellers within the United States – or for visitors from Europe . continuing further west into the USA, or on into Central and South . America – Hartsfield-Jackson played host to 94 million passengers in . 2013. Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta held on to its position as the world's busiest airport . However, this was a slight decrease – of 1.1 per cent – on the airport’s performance in 2012, according to the figures released by the Airports Council International (ACI). This allowed a fast-growing rival to close the gap towards the top of the list. Beijing Capital International Airport saw 84 million passengers pass through its doors and terminals in 2012 – an increase of 2.2 per cent on numbers for the previous year. Positions three to six in the list remained unchanged. Heathrow . held its ground, followed closely by Tokyo International Airport, . Chicago O’Hare International and Los Angeles International.

Now the main air hub for the Middle East, Dubai International witnessed the arrival or transit of 66.4 million passengers in 2013. This was by far the biggest increase on growth in traffic on 2012 among the top ten busiest airports – a surge of 15 per cent. Dubai’s expansion in significance is set to continue to in the next few years. ‘With double-digit growth rates in passenger traffic for 2013, Dubai is likely to move up several spots again in the 2014 rankings, solidifying its status as the major hub connecting the east and west,’ says Rafael Echevame of the ACI. ‘Aviation’s nucleus appears to be moving eastward. ‘Other emerging markets such as Turkey, China and South-East Asia that have a critical mass of traffic remain major contributors to the upward surge in air transport demand. ‘This trend will continue into 2014.’ The top ten is rounded out by Paris’s Charles De Gaulle air hub, Texas terminus Dallas-Fort Worth, and Indonesia’s main airport Soekarno-Hatta in Jakarta. Atlanta also emerged at the top of the tree on the number of airplane movements in 2013. The Georgia airport saw 910,000 take-offs and landings during the 12 months of last year, narrowly eclipsing Chicago O’Hare (883,000 airplane movements) and Dallas-Fort Worth (678,000 take-offs and landings). Brave new worlds: Both Beijing (left) and Dubai (right) airports enjoyed a boom in passenger numbers in 2013 . These figures demonstrate that, when it comes to planes rather than passengers, the United States is still the main player in the aviation industry. Of the rest of the top ten, only two airports (in Beijing and Paris) were not on American soil – with the key air hubs in Los Angeles, Denver (in Colorado), Charlotte (in North Carolina), Las Vegas and Houston (in Texas) completing the list. Overall, air passenger traffic grew last year. The world’s airports served a total of 5.4 billion passengers in 12 months – an increase of 4 per cent on the figures for 2012.

"By . James  Nye . A white sports columnist is facing outrage after he compared the tattooed quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers to the residents of San Quentin state prison. Sporting News writer David Whitley has been labeled a racist by some for his sweeping generalisations after he penned an article that bemoaned the amount of tattoos that 25-year-old Colin Kaepernick had on his body. Claiming that the position of quarterback is hallowed and Kaepernick's body art brings it down in tone, Whitley said that because of his tattoos, the 49ers player can never be a legitimate hero. But he later defended himself against accusations of racism, saying: 'If they were old enough to read, my two adopted African-American . daughters would certainly be disappointed to find out I'm a racist.' “It didn’t occur to me that admitting I’m not a fan of body art would be admitting I don’t like African-Americans.' It is the extensive body art of Colin Kaepernick - the quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers that has so upset sports columnist David Whitely . The furious response overwhelmed Whitley, who had to fend off accusations of racial profiling, prompting his editor-in-chief to take the unusual step of writing a defence of the opinion piece in which he admitted Whitley could have finessed certain points. Whitley, who is the father of two adopted African-American daughters, was even criticised by Kaepernick's parents - who revealed that his tattoos are in fact verses from the Bible. Sporting News columnist David Whitley has sparked outrage with his opinion piece that compares the ownership of tattoos to being incarcerated in prison . The column which was published on Wednesday, seems to take aim at the new tattoed breed of sporting stars and declare that it is inappropriate for someone in his position on the team to possess them. 'San Francisco's Colin Kaepernick is going to be a big-time NFL quarterback. That must make the guys in San Quentin happy,' wrote Whitley in AOL FanHouse. 'Approximately 98.7 per cent of the inmates at California's state prison have tattoos. I don't know that as fact, but I've watched enough Lockup to know it's close to accurate.' He continued: 'NFL quarterback is the ultimate position of influence and responsibility. He is the CEO of a high profile organisation, and you don't want your CEO to look like he just got paroled.' Warming to his theme, Whitley argues that quarterbacks are different from the rest of professional athletes and should be 'the last line of defence against the raging sea of ink'. 'For dinosaurs like me,' continues Whitley, 'NFL quarterbacks were our little Dutch boys. The original hero stuck his finger in the dyke to save Holland. 'Pro QBs were the last line of defense against the raging sea of ink. When our kids said they wanted a tattoo, we could always point to the Manning brothers.' Condemnation of the columnists comments was swift, with Kaepernick's adoptive parents expressing their anger to USA Today. 'It annoyed me,' said his mother Teresa Kaepernick. 'You are categorizing this kid on something like tattoos? Really? Saying other guys are role models because they don't have them? Really? Inked Quarterback: San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has made two starts this NFL season and is highly rated by football pundits . Some of these other guys don't have crystal clear reputations. That's how you're going to define this kid? It's pretty irritating is what it is.' Responding to the fury, Sporting News editor-in-chief Garry D. Howard wrote a story explaining his employees column. 'Whitley’s message was somewhat lost in his flurry of one-liners, but his intention was sincere and honest,' wrote Howard. 'As a sports editor who also happens to be African-American, it is my job to vet each and every opinion piece to ensure that the message does not get lost and I certainly could have done more, in retrospect, to make sure it did not.' Indeed in his column, Whitley attempts to preemptively refute any racist overtones. 'It's not just a white thing, I hope,' wrote Whitley as publisher AOL added a disclaimer to the bottom of the column, saying the piece did not necessarily reflect the company's position. Role Model: Quarterback Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers warms up before a game against the Seattle Seahawks in October . Body Art: David Beckham is famous for his elaborate tattoos and has been credited with popularising the trend across the world . Responding to the criticism he received, Whitley refuted any suggestions that he was racist. 'It didn’t occur to me that admitting I’m not a fan of body art would be admitting I don’t like African-Americans,' he told his website. 'I’m pretty sure the middle-aged women at the gym with barbed-wire tats that I referenced are white. 'If they were old enough to read, my two adopted African-American daughters would certainly be disappointed to find out I’m a racist.' Expressing his rage at the author, Rick Kaepernick, Colin's father said that Whitley should have focused on his son's charity work and not his body art. 'This guy has probably never talked to Colin,' Rick said. 'Instead of saying that Colin does all these great things and donates his time to children, this guy is going to make him out like a gangster. Really? I guess you just have to roll with the punches.' 'Somebody asked me if I got mad about that. I said no. It's just a guy and his opinion. I could have an opinion about him, but I've never met the guy, so I don't know if my opinion would be right.'","David Whitley sparks massive by comparing San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick's tattoos to those of prison inmates .

"By . Rebecca Camber . A mother has died after being stabbed in the neck in broad daylight on a busy London street. Horrified onlookers watched in terror yesterday as a knifeman casually walked up to the 42-year-old victim and stabbed her at least four times in the neck before calmly lighting a cigarette as he stood over her prone body. According to witnesses, the mother was on her way home after dropping her child off at school when she was confronted by a man who lashed out knifing her multiple times in a frenzied attack. He then coolly rolled a cigarette as he . stood over the woman, who still had a knife embedded in her neck, until . police officers arrived to arrest him. Police and forensics at the scene in North London where a woman was stabbed to death in the street . The mother, 42, was stabbed in the neck four times at this location in Tottenham, north London . The victim was taken to a central London hospital where she was pronounced dead. Last night police were quizzing a 46-year-old who was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder. Police believe that the man was known to the victim, although they were unable to confirm the nature of their relationship last night. Eyewitnesses to the murder which happened just before 1pm in Bruce Grove, Tottenham described how the man was led away in handcuffs with his hands covered in blood. Sergio Fernandes, 21, said: ‘I think these people had issues together. ‘I was talking to a few witnesses and they said he stabbed her up four times in the neck. ‘He stood there knowing he had done something wrong and rolled up a cigarette and let the police take him away. ‘She was lying there with the knife still sticking out of her neck, and he had blood all over his hands.’ The . co-founder of Unity Radio, based nearby in the Bruce Grove Youth . Centre, added: ‘People are saying that she had just come back from . dropping her child off at school.’ The knifeman is said to have attacked the woman before rolling a cigarette over her body in Tottenham . Mental health worker Marcia Williams, 53, spoke to an eyewitness just moments after police arrived. She said: ‘It seemed to be a random attack, the man just walked up to her and did it. ‘The witness was very shaken up - she said the woman was stabbed in the neck but didn’t go into any other detail. ‘The victim fell right on the floor straightaway. ‘She was still there when I came out but you couldn’t see anything because a police van was blocking the scene.’ Last night Twitter was awash with speculation about the gruesome killing, with some posts suggesting she may have been knifed up to 19 times. One user, Bella Symoni said: ‘A lady got stabbed in her neck 19 times on bruce grove high road, the poor nurse man.’ Last night forensic officers were still combing the scene where markers could be seen by a discarded bag of tobacco next to a pool of blood. The victim was taken to a central London hospital where she was pronounced dead after what is thought to be an unprovoked attack . A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘Police were called shortly before 1pm on Wednesday, 19 March, to reports of a woman stabbed in Bruce Grove, Tottenham. ‘Officers and London Ambulance Service attended the scene. ‘The 42-year-old victim was taken by ambulance to a central London hospital where she was pronounced dead. ‘Officers believe they know the identity of the deceased, but await formal identification. Next of kin have been informed. ‘A 46-year-old man was arrested at the scene. He has been taken to a north London police station where he remains in custody.’ Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh from the Met’s Homicide and Major Crime Command appealed for witnesses last night. He said: ‘I need to hear for anyone who was in the Bruce Grove area shortly before 1pm who may have witnessed the incident. ‘Anyone with information should call the incident room on 020 8785 8099. To remain anonymous call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.’","Woman, 42, stabbed in the neck by a knifeman in Tottenham, London .

"By . Tara Brady . A rhino poacher in South Africa has been sentenced to 77 years in prison in one of the heaviest penalties aimed at stopping poachers who target rhinos for their horns. The sentencing of Mandla Chauke, a South African who was arrested in Kruger National Park in 2011, shows that South African courts are starting to realise the negative impact that poaching has not only on wildlife but also on an economy heavily dependent on tourism. Reynold Thakhuli, spokesman from South Africa's national parks service, said: 'We hope this will be a deterrent.' In danger: White rhinoceros photographed in Kruger National Park in South Africa . Earlier this month, a South African court sentenced two Mozambicans to 16 years in prison for killing a rhino and taking its horn last year in Kruger park, where many poachers cross from neighboring Mozambique. In late 2012, a South African court sentenced a Thai national to 40 years in prison for selling rhino horns. Kruger park has lost 370 rhinos to poachers this year - well over half the total for South Africa - and 62 people have been arrested in connection with some of the cases, according to the parks service. A mural painted on a suburban wall in Johannesburg, South Africa calls for the halt to rhino poaching . South Africa, which has 70 per cent of the world's rhinos, lost a record 1,004 of the animals to poachers in 2013, according to government figures. Some Vietnamese and Chinese view rhino horn as a status symbol and a healing agent, despite a lack of evidence that it can cure. The horn is made of keratin, a protein also found in human fingernails. Chauke, the poacher, and two accomplices shot three rhinos after illegally entering Kruger park. They then got into a shootout with patrolling rangers in which one suspect was killed and another fled, according to police. Chauke was convicted of murder, illegal hunting of rhinos, rhino horn theft, illegal possession of firearms and ammunition, as well as trespassing in a national park. He was sentenced yesterday in the Nelspruit Magistrates Court, near Kruger in the north eastern part of South Africa. Prosecutors had argued successfully that Chauke should be convicted for the murder of the accomplice who was killed by rangers, South Africa's SABC News said on its website. The judge rejected Chauke's argument that he was forced into the poaching excursion by his accomplices. In a separate case, five suspected poachers appeared in court yesterday after they were arrested in a game reserve in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province, south of Kruger park, according to police. The group was detained after a shootout with police in which one suspect was injured. They now face charges which include attempted murder, the South African Press Association reported.","Mandla Chauke was arrested in Kruger National Park in 2011 .

"By . Tara Brady . A bullying boyfriend was jailed today for attacking an heroic soldier who saved his girlfriend from drowning. Army Captain Mark Gold, 43, was strolling along the River Taff in Cardiff city centre when he saw Martin Edwards, 43, pushing girlfriend Leanne Ware, 31, into the freezing water. Captain Gold rang 999 and rushed into the water to drag Miss Ware’s lifeless body from the swollen river in February. Caught: Martin Edwards, 43, (left) pushed girlfriend Leanne Ware, 31, (right) into the freezing water . But he was punched by raging Edwards as he dragged her limp body to safety. A court heard Edwards lashed out and screamed at the soldier: 'F**k off, leave her alone, she’s my girlfriend. I’ll sort her out.' Captain Gold fought off the attack and pulled unconscious Miss Ware to the river bank. He then brought her back from the dead by performing CPR. Hero soldier captain Mark Gold, 43 (pictured) who saved a woman from drowning . Prosecutor John Philpotts said Miss Ware was face down in the fast flowing river for around three minutes before Army medic Captain Gold managed to reach her lifeless body on the riverbank. Mr Philpotts told Cardiff Crown Court: 'Edwards told Captain Gold to “f**k off” and was flailing his arms about. 'Captain Gold managed to pull Miss Ware’s head out of the water but took a blow to his face for the trouble from Edwards. 'By now Miss Ware had been in the water for sometime. She was blue and appeared to be unresponsive. 'Captain Gold shouted at Edwards to release Miss Ware and told him she was dead because that is how it appeared to him. 'Edwards stopped behaving aggressively at that point. Maybe he realised what he was doing.' The court heard Miss Ware was effectively dead and was at the lowest level a human can possibly be on the Glasgow Coma Scale. Captain Gold told the court: 'She was blue, not moving and had no pulse. She was dead. 'She had been under the water for close to three minutes and there were no signs of life.' But Captain Gold, who has served in the Royal Army Medical Corps for 21 years, began CPR on her lifeless body in a vain attempt to bring her back from the dead. With the help of a passing doctor who performed mouth-to-mouth they miraculously managed to revive her. Paramedics eventually arrived and rushed Miss Ware to hospital where she made a full recovery. Captain Gold fought off the attack and pulled unconscious Miss Ware to the bank where he revived her . Captain Gold identified Edwards to police officers at the scene and they arrested him after the attack. Edwards, of Butetown, Cardiff, was cleared by a jury of attempted murder but was found guilty of unlawfully inflicting grievous bodily harm on Miss Ware and assaulting Captain Gold. He was sentenced to three and a half years in jail for GBH and seven days for the assault on Captain Gold.","Army Captain Mark Gold, 43, was strolling along the banks of the River Taff .

"By . Tara Brady . It is touted as a wild night out. But after-hours parties at London Zoo are becoming a little too wild – and it’s the guests rather than the  animals who are to blame. Drunken revellers have been taunting and abusing the animals at Zoo Lates events, which are held on Friday nights over the summer. Recent incidents include a woman punching a bird, a male visitor pouring beer on a tiger, a reveller stripping off before attempting to enter the penguin enclosure and butterflies routinely squashed underfoot. Scroll down for video . Going wild: Revellers can opt for fancy dress during a night out at London Zoo. Pictured are guests at a previous Zoo Lates event who are not involved in any of the abuse claims . There are also claims that a drunken woman tried to get into the lion enclosure. The animals are said to have been disturbed by loud noise and flash photography at the parties. Sources at London Zoo are said to have raised serious concerns about the impact on animals’ sleep and stress levels. The world’s oldest zoo has been hosting the sessions for several years to attract a younger age group, generating £800,000 a year to fund its conservation work. The animals are said to have been disturbed by loud noise and flash photography at the parties . A source at the zoo said: ‘During the day, welfare and conservation is of the utmost priority. In the evening, that seems to go out of the window, and the animals become a commodity. ‘That’s not what zoos are about, but there’s a lot of money in it.’ More than 6,000 people attend each Zoo Lates event. Tickets cost up to £35, and the price includes some free wine. Recent incidents include a man pouring beer on a tiger during one of the zoo's late night events . One visitor in June reported seeing a woman accidentally punching a bird in the aviary. ‘I don’t know how drunk she was but clearly she had been drinking for a while,’ the female witness told the Guardian. ‘She stumbled and inadvertently punched the side of the bird  and the bird took off. I could not believe it.’ She added: ‘I saw animals being taunted, and saw people banging on the glass. 'One man was rubbing himself on the glass in the snake enclosure. 'In the butterfly exhibit, people were so careless, crushing butterflies on the ground.’ London Zoo confirmed the tiger and penguin incidents, but said there was no record of a woman trying to enter the lion enclosure. A spokesman said the zoo believed the events were safe. ‘We would ban alcohol if we thought it was necessary but at the moment we see no need to do so,’ she said, adding that only three people were ejected from the events during 2013 and 2014.","Drunken revellers have been taunting and abusing animals at London Zoo .

"By . Tara Brady . A mother has been threatened with a fine and criminal record for taking her terminally ill son out of school for what could be his final holiday. Maxine Ingrouille-Kidd, 56, wanted to take Curtis, 13, a quadriplegic with cerebral palsy, on the trip of a lifetime after doctors said he could die between the ages of 14 and 19. The mother-of-three was due to take her son on a cruise during this October's half-term holiday, but she had to move it because the ship wasn't equipped to handle his needs. Precious time: Maxine Ingrouille-Kidd wants to take Curtis on holiday before he dies . So she changed the date to later in October and requested a holiday form from the school. However, she was left 'flabbergasted and shocked' when the mainstream school, with provisions for special needs, refused and told her she could be fined or face a criminal record. Mrs Ingrouille-Kidd, from Wedmore, Somerset, told The Sunday Times: 'My son is 14 in October. This could well be his last holiday. 'Curtis is a quadriplegic, has cerebral palsy and epilepsy and is registered blind. He is never going to have a career, he is going to spend the rest of his life with us looking after him. 'The only relaxation he can get is swimming, so a cruise ship with a pool where he can also enjoy the sensory motion of a boat is ideal for him. 'I asked for a holiday request form from the school but was absolutely shocked and flabbergasted when the response was ""no"". Exceptional case: Curtis is due to go on holiday with his mother in October but his school has said she will be fined . 'It's the thought that I might be committing a crime that upsets me. I am a law-abiding citizen and this has been very stressful.' Mrs Ingrouille-Kidd, who runs a nursery in Wedmore, has been working all summer while other staff members take holidays, so that her trip could coincide with her silver wedding anniversary to husband Peter, and Curtis's birthday. One of her elder sons took to Facebook to share the problem, with other friends and parents lending their support. Mrs Ingrouille-Kidd added: 'People were saying they would set up a JustGiving page to pay our fines but the fines are not the problem.' John Osman, the leader of Somerset county council, said: 'This case does sound like exceptional circumstances. I am keen to talk to the headteacher... to make sure they understand the circumstances.' The Department of Education added: 'We have been clear that all headteachers are free to grant pupils leave in exceptional circumstances.' Mrs Ingrouille-Kidd isn't the first to fall foul of the strict holiday rules, which were introduced by the former education secretary Michael Gove. Maeve Flanagan, from Bracknell in Berkshire, was fined £120 for taking her son to a family wedding in September, with an additional £150 being added when she failed to pay on time - because she had been referred for ovarian cancer. Jason Short, from Plymouth, was fined for taking his daughter out of school because it was the only time he could get off work. He had booked it 12 months in advance and was told it was okay. However, when the rule changes came in, he returned from his holiday to find a letter saying he would be fined £60. More than 200,000 people have signed a petition against the policy on the 38 Degrees website.","Curtis Ingrouille-Kidd, 13, is a quadriplegic with cerebral palsy .

"By . Tara Brady . Police are believed to be 'closing in' on the drug dealer who sold Peaches Geldof the heroin that killed her . Police are 'closing in' on the drug dealer who sold Peaches Geldof the heroin that killed her, it has emerged. It is believed officers have identified a 'handful' of suspects who could have sold her the drug. Peaches was found dead in her home in April by her 23-year-old husband, musician Thomas Cohen. Returning from a weekend away, he found her slumped on a bed, her lifeless body covered in needle marks. The couple’s son, Phaedra, who she had been looking after, was also in the house. Next to the mother-of-two’s body was a sweet box containing a used syringe, with a pair of knotted tights, apparently used as a tourniquet, her inquest last week heard. Mr Cohen told the hearing that the young mother, who had been battling to stay clean from drugs, had relapsed in February and was hiding heroin in the loft. Heroin supplies found in the house by police were 61 per cent pure, more than twice the level of purity of commonly traded street heroin which was worth about up to £550. Tragically, just a few hours before her death, Peaches had posted a picture of herself and her mother on Instagram, with the caption: ‘Me and my mum.’ The TV presenter died of a heroin overdose when Peaches was 11. Her youngster daughter Tiger Lily was at her side when Miss Yates was found. It is believed officers are now preparing to arrest suspects they believe gave Peaches the heroin - possibly in the London and south of England area - and raid their homes for evidence. A source told the Sunday Mirror: 'The astonishingly high purity levels of the drug are a major concern and mean that somebody is selling heroin at a strength that is well capable of killing again. 'They have to be found and they have to be stopped.' Peaches Geldof with her sons, Phaedra and Astala before she took a lethal dose of heroin which killed her . According to reports last week, her husband Thomas Cohen has not returned to the £1million country home they shared in Wrotham, Kent, because he has been left so traumatised by her death. The inquest into her death this week heard how Mr Cohen, 24, found his wife slumped dead on a bed with puncture marks and 79 syringes and burnt spoons were scattered in their home. She had been looking after their baby son Phaedra, who was left alone for up to 17 hours. Just a few hours before her death, Peaches had posted a picture of herself and her mother on Instagram . Mr Cohen gave evidence last Wednesday at the inquest into the 25-year-old's death. North West Kent Coroner Roger Hatch said the television presenter, model and journalist had been trying to wean herself off drugs and was clean five months before she died. She had been prescribed the heroin substitute methadone to cure her addiction. Mr Cohen, who was the singer in the band S.C.U.M., paid tribute to his wife of 19 months after she died. Grieving: Thomas Cohen, husband of Peaches Geldof, leaving the inquest into his wife's death in Kent last week . Investigation: Police officers at the home of Peaches Geldof in Wrotham, Kent, where her body was found . He said: 'My beloved wife Peaches was adored by myself and her two sons Astala and Phaedra and I shall bring them up with their mother in their hearts everyday. 'We shall love her forever.' Meanwhile, the sisters of Peaches have stepped in to help raise her two sons. Pixie, 23, Tiger Lily, 17, and Fifi Trixibelle, 31, are rallying around Peaches' husband and spending as much time as they can with their nephews. A family friend told the Sunday People: 'It's really impressive how the sisters have taken on the roll of caring for the boys. Peaches would be so proud.' The boys are living with Mr Cohen's parents Sue and Keith in Eltham, south-east London, but Peaches' sisters are regular visitors who often take them out, read them stories or watch programmes with them. Kent Police and the National Crime Association are working together to investigate Peaches' death. A spokeswoman for Kent Police said there had been no update but that it would not be able to comment about the progress of an investigation, operation or case.","Officers identified a 'handful' of suspects who could have sold her the drug .

"By . Tara Brady . A heroic woman gardener dived into the River Thames to save a drowning labradoodle in a vet's collar which had jumped over the wall of its owner's garden. Julia Wylie, 36, had been working in the garden of her client's home in Putney, London, when the puppy called Jess jumped over the back wall of the £2million home next to the river. With no thought for her own life, Ms Wylie instinctively took her shoes off and jumped in after the puppy. Images show Ms Wylie desperately holding the dog under her arm in 25ft of water on Tuesday. Hero: Julia Wylie is pulled to safety after jumping into the River Thames to save the life of a drowning puppy . It took 10 minutes before the pair were spotted by a crew member on a passing Thames Clipper river-bus. The captain steered the boat towards Miss Wylie and the puppy before a second-mate threw a rope into the water. Miss Wylie, from Brixton, told the Evening Standard: 'I had no hesitation about jumping in. 'I took off my shoes and jumped down six feet. When I got in I tried to hang onto plants on the side of the wall but the tide was really strong and all the bushes just pulled off when I tried to grab them.' The captain steered the boat towards Miss Wylie and the puppy before a rope was thrown into the water . It took 10 minutes before the pair were spotted by a crew member on a passing Thames Clipper river-bus . A Port of London Authority rescue boat was called and managed to pull the pair out of the water . Miss Wylie soon realised that there was nothing to hold on to and had to tread water while lifting Jess up. She also feared the current would drag them down river. Joseph Wiltshire, 22, was on board the river-bus when he threw a rope out to Miss Wylie. A Port of London Authority rescue boat was called and managed to pull the pair out of the water in front of a cheering crowd. The dog was returned to its owner while Ms Wylie was checked over. She then arrived back at her client's house in her soaked through clothes and barefoot. The dog was returned to its owner while Ms Wylie was checked over after the ordeal . The Port of London Authority said the rescue showed great teamwork on the River Thames . Before she left she put chicken wire along the wall to help prevent the Jess from jumping over again. Martin Garside, from the Port of London Authority, described Mr Wiltshire as a hero. He said: 'This successful rescue of both the woman and the dog was a great piece of teamwork on the Thames. 'Joe Wiltshire from the Thames Clipper Riverbus showed great skill  and professionalism in getting a rope to them both swiftly. 'He then worked side by side with Jim Denby and Danny Marsh from the Port of London Authority to get Julia and the dog Jess to safety on board our launch ‘Benfleet’. 'All three guys did a grand job and we were pleased to play our part.'","Julia Wylie was working in the garden of her client's home in Putney, London .

"By . Tara Brady . Tragic: Daniel Spargo-Mabbs, 16, suffered three . heart attacks after downing half a gram of MDMA powder in water at a . rave in Hayes, west London . The parents of a schoolboy who died after taking ecstasy are determined that other young people learn about the danger of drugs from his tragic death. Daniel Spargo-Mabbs, 16, suffered three heart attacks after downing half a gram of MDMA powder in water at a rave in Hayes, west London, in January this year. Over the next three days his heart-broken parents Tim and Fiona Spargo-Mabbs had to watch him slowly die, as the drug caused his vital organs to stop functioning. Now they have set up a charitable foundation in his memory to educate young people about the danger of drugs. They are also raising funds to produce a play for schools about his death. Daniel’s Oxford University-educated mother, Fiona, said: 'Daniel was funny, good company - he was cheeky, intelligent and curious about the world. 'He had a zest for life and to learn about the unknown. He was loved by so many people from all sorts of groups, he knew how to engage people. 'All through that day he was vacillating about whether to go to the rave, with a group of boys he did not know very well, or to come home to his mum. 'If he had come home he would still be here today. 'We really miss him. His death has left a gaping hole, not just in our lives but in the fabric of society. 'We’re slowly trying to rebuild our lives into whatever our ""new normal"" will be, but we’ve barely begun and have a long road ahead of us.' Tim and Fiona Spargo-Mabbs, the parents of 16-year-old Daniel Spargo-Mabbs, who took a fatal dose of ecstasy at a rave, sit with their son Jacob, as they talk about their loss, at their home in Croydon . After taking the drug, Daniel's heartbroken parents Tim and Fiona had to watch him slowly die . However, the couple are determined to make something positive come from his death and have set up the Daniel Spargo-Mabbs Foundation, which is working with parents, teachers and students to warn about the dangers of drugs. The foundation is campaigning to have drug awareness classes in schools, rather than one-off lessons, and to help students learn exactly what different drugs will do to them and what the warning signs are. Mrs Spargo-Mabbs, who works as a manager in adult education for Croydon Council, said: 'We need to educate young people about the consequences of taking drugs - that you never know what is in the drug you are going to take and what it will do to you. Ryan Kirk, 21, from Beckenham, South London, was charged with being concerned in supplying a controlled drug of class A - MDMA to Daniel (pictured) but has been cleared by a jury . 'Teenagers listen to their parents, . peers and teachers and we hope to engage them to spread the message . about the dangers of drugs. 'Had . Daniel lived he would have suffered brain damage and had his legs . amputated - people think if you take drugs you die or have a great . night, but there’s so much in between. 'We’re . working with playwright Mark Wheeller to produce a play about Daniel’s . death. We hope it will be performed in schools to help young people . engage with the issues and put themselves in the heads of the different . people. Grief: Mrs Spargo-Mabbs is calling for young people to be better educated about drugs . 'We want something . positive to come out of Daniel’s death. Someone else has died after . taking the drug since Daniel’s death and young people will keep dying as . long as they keep taking drugs. 'If someone reads about Daniel’s death and decided not to take drugs, that will be a positive thing.' Daniel’s . family opened their hearts after 21-year-old Ryan Kirk was found not . guilty last week of supplying the drugs that killed their son following a . trial at Isleworth Crown Court. Nicqueel Pitrora, 18, has previously pleaded guilty to selling the drugs to Daniel and his friends. Pitrora is in custody, awaiting sentencing. Mrs Spargo-Mabbs said: 'Justice has been done and the process which led to Ryan Kirk’s acquittal was fair. 'Obviously . someone sold the drugs to Daniel’s friends on that night. One man, . Nicqueel Pitrora, has pleaded guilty to providing drugs. 'Another . man, who supplied the drugs, is still out there. I hope that man thinks . seriously about what he has done and realises there are better things . to do with his life other than selling drugs and destroying his own and . other people’s futures. 'The verdict was not the most important thing for us. We have lost our son and nothing is going to bring him back. 'We . do not hate the people who did this to him, we have prayed for them. We . decided there are better things for us to do than carry around the . burden of hate and anger.' Daniel’s . parents took part in a fundraising cycle raid from their home in . Croydon, south London, to Brighton at the weekend to raise cash for the . Foundation. Mrs Spargo-Mabbs . said: 'The cycle ride was fantastic and the best possible antidote to . all the horribleness of the last week in court - doing something . amazingly positive, surrounded by people who care deeply about Dan’s . death, and about us, and hopefully raising funds to stop any other . family having to go through what we have been since January. 'Tim did the ride on Dan’s bike, which he’s been using all season in Dan’s memory, and wearing his shorts. 'The group has been riding all season in support of the Foundation, and has now cycled a total of 5,262 miles. 'We’re . hoping to be able to raise the £4,800 we need to fund the Mark Wheeller . play commission, which is going to be such an exciting and powerful . project.'","Daniel Spargo-Mabbs died after taking drugs at a warehouse party in Hayes .

The schoolboy said he thought he had simply caught his arm behind the handle after experiencing a dull pain but was horrified to discover the freak injury. Firefighters and paramedics were called to the incident on Friday afternoon and the handle had to be removed from the door.\nThomas Temple/Rossparry.co.uk . William Tattersall lies in hospital with the door handle still impaled in his arm close to a major artery . Firefighters and paramedics were called to the home on Friday afternoon and the handle had to be removed from the door. William, who was taken to hospital with the handle still lodged in his arm, said: 'It felt quite painful and I was worrying thinking it would be quite serious. 'I felt like I was going to collapse.It was just a blunt pain.' The metal handle had lodged under the skin of the underside of William’s arm, yet it did not draw any blood. Luckily for the youngster his mother Alex and older brother James, who are both nurses, were at home and able to reassure him that everything was going to be okay.

"By . Tara Brady . The BBC is to cut more than 400 posts under plans to make millions of pounds of savings over the next two years. Staff were told details of the cuts at a briefing at the corporation’s central London headquarters, including news of new jobs being created. Around 190 new posts will be created, with 415 cut, leading to a net reduction of 220 full-time jobs across news and current affairs. Director General Tony Hall arrives BBC Broadcasting House in London. Staff have been told there will be cuts . Director of news James Harding gave staff details of the cuts as well as changes such as combining production teams for some BBC programmes. It is believed there will be around 79 job losses in the newsroom saving £11 million and 53 cuts in news gathering saving £6 million. Five jobs will go from programmes helping to save £3 million while 105 jobs will go from the World Service. Office closures will save £1.5 million, while two posts will go from political programmes. Around £4 million will be invested in 'digital transformation' and £38million in 'original and distinctive' journalism. Plans were also announced to reduce the TV current affairs budget and a 'reshaped' newsgathering operation, including smaller and more 'agile' reporting teams. BBC newsreader George Alagiah. It is believed there will be around 79 job losses in the newsroom, saving £11 million and 53 cuts in newsgathering, saving £6 million . The World Service budget will be increased by £5 million to £250 million by 2016/17. The BBC said £12million will be invested in digital platforms and £8 million on creating additional specialist editors and correspondents. In an email to staff, Mr Harding said: 'I recognise that there is a difference between full-time positions and the number of people who fill them: given that we are an organisation where there is a high degree of job sharing and part-time working, I expect that closer to 500 people may be affected by these job closures. NUJ General Secretary Michelle Stanistreet said the cuts will further undermine the ability of journalists to deliver quality content . 'The redundancy process itself will mean pools of people are put at risk. I appreciate that this means an even larger number of people face uncertainty over the coming weeks. I would also stress that all of the changes are subject to consultation in the coming weeks. 'We will, as ever, make strenuous efforts to fill the new posts through redeployment, and we will welcome applications for voluntary redundancy. We cannot guarantee that we will always be able to grant requests but we will try to do so. 'We all share the distress, concern and anxiety that such a sweeping round of cost savings will cause. We are going to see colleagues that we respect leave the BBC. It will have an impact, directly and indirectly, on a great many people inside the organisation. 'We are going to go through a very testing time of uncertainty and change. Its consequences will be felt by audiences too: you cannot take tens of millions of pounds out of a news organisation that delivers so much to so many people every minute of the day and expect those losses to go unseen, unheard and unnoticed.' The BBC added there will be two posts lost in political programmes among production staff and 22 in programmes for 2015/16, with a further five the following year. NUJ General Secretary Michelle Stanistreet said: 'These cuts will further undermine the ability of journalists to deliver quality content. 'The way in which the BBC wants to carry out the redundancies is the latest move from a management whose approach to recruitment is to grab a coffee with their pals and find them a berth without so much as an interview, doling out jobs with salaries that are way in excess of the normal rates.'","Staff told details at the corporation’s central London headquarters today .

"By . Tara Brady . Eye tests could in the future be used to diagnose early-stage Alzheimer's, new research suggests. Early trials of two different techniques show that a key Alzheimer's trait can be identified in the retina and lens of the eye. Both methods were able to distinguish between probable Alzheimer's patients and healthy volunteers with a high level of accuracy. Regular eye tests could in the future be used to diagnose early-stage Alzheimer's . Although the research is still at an early stage, further work could see such tests used as a first step in identifying individuals with Alzheimer's. After an initial eye test, more expensive and costly procedures such as PET (positron emission tomography) scans or spinal fluid analysis would then be used to confirm the disease. Virtually every trial of a drug designed to halt or reverse Alzheimer's progression has ended in failure because the patients taking part have already suffered too much damage to their brains, scientists believe. Shaun Frost, from the Australian science agency the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, who led one of the studies, said: 'We envision this technology potentially as an initial screen that could complement what is currently used: brain PET imaging, MRI imaging, and clinical tests. 'If further research shows that our initial findings are correct, it could potentially be delivered as part of an individual's regular eye check-up. 'The high resolution level of our images could also allow accurate monitoring of individual retinal plaques as a possible method to follow progression and response to therapy.' The eye tests exploit the fact that the eye is, in effect, an extension of the brain . The eye tests exploit the fact that the eye is, in effect, an extension of the brain. In both studies, scientists looked for signs of beta-amyloid protein, which forms clumps in the brains of Alzheimer's patients and is a key hallmark of the disease. The Australian team used the turmeric spice ingredient curcumin as a fluorescent tag that allowed beta-amyloid to show up in the retina. A total of 200 volunteers were first asked to take a supplement of curcumin, which binds strongly to beta-amyloid. The protein was then detected in the eye using an imaging system. Levels of beta-amyloid in the retina mirrored those shown in the brain by PET imaging. Preliminary results on 40 participants showed that the test picked up every participant with Alzheimer's and correctly identified more than 80 per cent of those who did not. In the other study, researchers from the U.S. company Cognoptix Inc used an ointment to apply a fluorescent label to beta-amyloid in the lens of the eye. Laser scanning was then able to detect the protein. In tests of 40 volunteers with and without Alzheimer's, it identified those having the disease with 85 per cent accuracy. Paul Hartung, president and chief executive of Cognoptix Inc, said: 'This system shows promise as a technique for early detection and monitoring of the disease.' 'These studies provide proof of principle that scanning the eye for amyloid could give us insight about what is going on in the brain' Dr Simon Ridley, from the charity Alzheimer's Research UK . Both tests showed that levels of beta-amyloid in the eye mirrored those seen in the brain by PET imaging. The results were presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Copenhagen. Dr Simon Ridley, head of science at the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said: 'It is difficult to diagnose Alzheimer's disease accurately and, in many cases, by the time the symptoms have developed, damage has already been going on in the brain for a number of years. 'The development of a quick, cheap, non-invasive test to detect Alzheimer's would be an important step in helping people to receive an early diagnosis, and helping to improve clinical trials so that potential new treatments have the best chance of success. 'This research is promising but is in the very early stages and involves very small sample sizes. 'It is too soon to determine whether these types of tests will be useful for diagnosis of dementia and we would need to see the results of larger trials before drawing any firmer conclusions.' Dr Doug Brown, director of research at the Alzheimer's Society, said: 'Finding new and better ways to detect the early stages of Alzheimer's disease could be a game changer for both future research and for people who will develop the condition. 'These studies provide proof of principle that scanning the eye for amyloid could give us insight about what is going on in the brain. 'However as they are only preliminary studies, the eye scans will need further validation before they could be used on people with dementia.'","A key Alzheimer's trait can be identified in the retina and lens of the eye .

"By . Tara Brady . Mark Simmonds said Scotland Yard had flagged up 14 'serious' offices by people with diplomatic immunity . Two Saudi diplomats have avoided drink-drive charges in the UK because they have diplomatic immunity. However, anyone caught drink-driving in Saudi's capital Riyadh would face 800 lashes. Mark Simmonds, a Foreign Office minister, said Scotland Yard's diplomatic protection group had flagged up 14 'serious and significant' offences last year by people with diplomatic immunity. A Pakistani diplomat is alleged to have committed a domestic rape while under the protection of diplomatic immunity, the Foreign Office said. Mr Simmonds noted the alleged offence in the annual report on serious offences alleged against foreign diplomats and emphasised the Foreign Office seeks to have immunity waived in serious cases. The Foreign Office defines serious offences as those which would carry a sentence of more than 12 months if a conviction was secured. The rape allegation was among 14 offences alleged against foreign diplomats, which also included a child abduction by a Pakistani diplomat, claims of actual bodily harm against a Cameroon and a Zambian diplomat, and a sexual assault alleged against a Zambian diplomat. There were six drink-driving claims made - two against Saudi diplomats and one each against officials from Belarus, Macedonia, Kuwait and Zambia. Saudi Arabia which enforces Islamic law has a strict ban on alcohol. In 2002 a British businessman was sentenced to 800 lashes, jailed for eight years and fined £400,000 after being convicted of running an establishment which sold alcohol. Prince Saud bin Abdulaziz bin Nasir al-Saud, who is a member of the Saudi royal family, was jailed in 2010 for murdering his manservant in a London hotel. A Saudi man rides his bike in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where anyone caught drink-driving faces 800 lashes . However, he was allowed to return to Riyadh after only serving three years of his life sentence following a transfer agreement with the Saudi government. The two diplomats accused of drink-driving have not been named but it has been said they will punished by the royal family's enforcers. In a written statement to MPs, Mr Simmonds said: 'Some 21,500 people are entitled to diplomatic immunity in the United Kingdom and the majority of diplomats abide by UK law. The number of alleged serious crimes committed by members of the diplomatic community in the UK is proportionately low. 'Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961, those entitled to immunity are expected to obey the law. The FCO does not tolerate foreign diplomats breaking the law. 'We take all allegations of illegal activity seriously. When instances of alleged criminal conduct are brought to our attention by the police, we ask the relevant foreign government to waive diplomatic immunity where appropriate. 'For the most serious offences, and when a relevant waiver has not been granted, we seek the immediate withdrawal of the diplomat.' Among the other allegations was one count of driving a vehicle reported as lost or stolen and without insurance, against a Sierra Leone official, one of driving while under the influence of alcohol and without insurance, against a diplomat from El Salvador, and one public order offence claimed against a diplomat from Kuwait.","Mark Simmonds, a Foreign Office minister, released a statement yesterday .

"By . Sophie Borland . and Claire Ellicott . Critical: Dr Katrina Erskine has warned the prosecution of a doctor announced last week could discourage medics from treating FGM victims . A top gynaecologist has strongly criticised the  decision to prosecute a  doctor for carrying out female genital mutilation. Dr Katrina Erskine warned that the landmark case announced last week – the first of its kind in the UK – put politics before women’s welfare and risked deterring medical staff from caring for affected women. On Friday, the Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders announced that there was enough evidence to charge Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena with allegedly carrying out the practice at the Whittington Hospital, North London. The procedure, known as FGM, is mostly practised on young girls as a form of circumcision in parts of Africa and the Middle East, using barbaric and primitive methods. Although it is illegal in this country, there have been reports of British girls being taken abroad by their parents to be mutilated. This particular case is unusual as Dr Dharmasena is alleged to have carried out FGM on a woman after she had given birth. The patient had already undergone the procedure when she was much younger. But Dr Erskine, a consultant gynaecologist and head of obstetrics at Homerton Hospital in East London, said the doctor had not actually performed FGM because the procedure had already taken place. She added that stitching done after the delivery – including to stop any bleeding – should not be seen as FGM. She also accused Mrs Saunders of putting politics first and said other gynaecologists were outraged by the decision. Writing in today’s Daily Mail, she said: ‘If, as a result of the Director of Public Prosecutions’s intervention, any post-delivery stitching or repair to a woman with FGM is going to be potentially considered as mutilation, then doctors and midwives will understandably hesitate before intervening. In certain situations, that potentially could cost a new mother her life.’ She added that all the cases she had seen personally had been mutilated abroad, and that she suspected the DPP was ‘under pressure’ to prosecute someone for carrying out FGM after all the publicity the subject had received. Arrest: The first charges in British history for causing female genital mutilation have been brought against two men. One, Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena, works at the Whittington Hospital in north London . Around 140million women worldwide are believed to have undergone FGM and campaigners hailed last week’s prosecution as a breakthrough in ending the practice. Forty-eight-year-old supermodel Waris Dirie was a victim in her native Somalia when she was just five years old, and has openly campaigned against it. She said previously: ‘This is about child protection. It is pure violence against girls, and it destroys their lives.’ Appearing before MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee yesterday, Mrs Saunders said a lack of referrals to police was partly behind the low number of prosecutions. When asked why the number of referrals was so low, she said: ‘If you wait for... the archetypal young girl to come and tell you about what’s just happened to her, that’s not going to happen. ‘There’s recognition we ought to be more proactive so we have been working with the police to look at leading investigations based on intelligence, which might help. Dr Dharmasena will appear before magistrates on April 15, alongside Hasan Mohamed, 40, who is believed to be a relative of the woman and has been charged with aiding and abetting the doctor. By DR KATRINA ERSKINE . Dr Katrina Erskine is an eminent gynaecologist working in an area of East London with a large migrant population. Here she tackles a difficult subject with honesty and candour. Some readers may recoil, but it’s an issue that must be aired. Activist: Supermodel Waris Dirie, 48, was a victim of FGM in her native Somalia when she was just five years old, and has openly campaigned against it . As a consultant gynaecologist working at an inner-city hospital in London’s East End, I’m all too used to seeing women who have been subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM). Hackney has substantial immigrant populations from Somalia and Eritrea – two of the many countries in Africa and the Middle East where FGM is still widely practised – and as a result many of the women who arrive at Homerton Hosptial, where I work, show the unmistakable signs of this barbaric practice. We see around 50 cases a year of the worst kind, so-called Type III FGM, where the clitoris and inner lips (labia minora) of the vagina have been sliced off and the outer lips (labia majora) sewn together to leave only a small opening. All the women that I personally have seen were born abroad, and had the FGM abroad, prior to their arrival in this country. The challenge for their doctors and midwives is to ensure that these women are safely delivered of their babies, despite the physical obstacles presented by FGM, and that’s a challenge that has just become a lot more difficult following the Director of Public Prosecutions’ decision to prosecute a British hospital doctor for carrying out FGM. The case in question is now sub-judice so I can’t comment on any clinical specifics, but what has seriously alarmed those of us working in the field is that the patient who was being treated by Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena at a North London hospital had already been subjected to FGM. If, as a result of the DPP’s intervention, any post-delivery stitching or repair to a woman with FGM is, itself, going to be potentially considered as mutilation then doctors and midwives will understandably hesitate, at the very least, before intervening. In certain situations, that potentially could cost a new mother her life. Where pregnant women arrive in British hospitals having already had FGM, surely it’s obvious that the only person guilty of that quite properly criminal act is whoever carried out the original mutilation. It’s certainly not the doctor or midwife, who is simply trying to stop any bleeding and mend  any tears after the trauma  of childbirth. Whether Alison Saunders, the DPP, felt under some pressure to bring a prosecution – any prosecution – given that she was about to appear before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, I can’t really comment, although I can see Mrs Saunders might have felt the need to have something to tell MPs. Others, however, have already pointed out how surprising it is that despite FGM being made a criminal act almost 30 years ago – either for carrying it out or aiding and abetting it – there has not yet been a single prosecution in Britain. Or not until last week. Under pressure? Dr Erskine saysr Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, would be better off focusing 'her department¿s efforts on the back-street butchers who are said to carry FGM out in this country' Perhaps this is because, in the 21 years I’ve worked as a gynaecologist at Homerton Hospital, I have never seen a British-born woman who has been subjected to FGM. Nor have I seen a woman of any nationality on whom FGM has been performed in Britain. Indeed, the only reason I know it happens in Britain at all is because respected colleagues tell me it does and because friends in the teaching profession, all too used to some of their female pupils mysteriously disappearing for a couple of weeks, back them up. Nevertheless, FGM in British-born women is rare so I’m not surprised the DPP has found it so difficult to prosecute. But she needs to concentrate her department’s efforts on the back-street butchers who are said to carry this atrocity out in this country, and on the parents who take their daughters abroad for the  procedure, not on hospital  doctors and midwives who are simply doing what they’ve been trained to do. Most pregnant women with Type III FGM who are seen at hospitals like mine are offered a procedure called ‘a defibulation’ in advance of their due date, during which the often tiny opening left by FGM is widened to accommodate the safe delivery of a baby. It’s a procedure that only needs to be performed once, before the delivery of the woman’s first baby, because after the baby has been born the vaginal opening will now be of normal dimensions. But some pregnant women with Type III FGM choose not to have a defibulation in advance, either through fear, embarrassment or simply because they prefer to have all the medical intervention required for the birth carried out at once. In these cases, doctors and midwives can only start to intervene when the woman arrives at the hospital having gone into labour. Court hearing: The pair who have been charged are due to appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court . Any birth can be traumatic but one that starts in these complex, challenging circumstances, particularly so. A defibulation has to be carried out on a woman who is already in labour and, as a result, once the baby has been delivered, the area around the vagina – newly operated upon, of course – will be raw, sore and bleeding. The new mother urgently needs stitches or, in some cases, there is a real risk she could bleed  to death. My concern is that following the DPP’s decision to prosecute a British hospital doctor, doctors and midwives will think twice about doing what they know to be medically right. Stitching up a woman who has had FGM after she has given birth is not the same as carrying out the mutilation itself, and it’s outrageous that the two things could possibly be confused. Now it may be that there are facts in the DPP’s prosecution that have not yet emerged: as I’ve already said, I cannot comment on a particular case. But the DPP and the Department of Health need to move quickly to end the confusion and make the general principle clear. Stitching up a bleeding woman who has previously been subjected to FGM is not the same as committing FGM itself. These poor women who come into our hospitals have already suffered enough – they’ve been mutilated, and then go through the trauma of childbirth. They need to be looked after by doctors and midwives who can confidently get on with what they’ve been trained to do, rather than looking nervously over their shoulders to see if a policeman has just walked into the  delivery suite clutching a pair  of handcuffs.

Naomi Oni has spoken about the investigation into the horrific acid attack and its devastating aftermath . Miss Oni (left), the victim of an acid attack, says police believed she had inflicted the grievous wounds on herself. Right, Mary Konye, who was jailed for 12 years for the attack . ‘All I’ve done is receive pain and backlash for her actions and other people’s incompetence,’ she said. ‘All I’ve done the whole time is just say what’s happened to me and I’ve been accused of doing it to myself, accused of lying basically. ‘The police are incompetent in terms of accusing me of doing it to myself when I’ve said that someone followed me from my workplace. ‘When I was in court and I saw the CCTV footage, you can blatantly see that what I said is what happened, so where did that accusation come from?’ She claimed the police missed key evidence from the CCTV film. ‘The police weren’t acting on what I was saying,’ said Miss Oni. ‘I was even told that they watched the CCTV footage and saw no one following me. ‘We saw the footage and there was a person in a veil following me. Why was this not found at the beginning? Nobody has answers.’ Miss Oni was attacked by Konye, 22, a university student, who followed her home from work wearing a niqab that covered her face, Snaresbrook Crown Court was told. When they were alone, Konye threw sulphuric acid in her face, nearly blinding her. Miss Oni now has to wear a silicone mask. Konye, of Canning Town, east London, claimed her friend asked her to carry out the attack because Miss Oni wanted ‘fame and fortune’ like Katie Piper, the model who suffered a similar attack. But her claims were rejected by the jury. Miss Oni told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday that when the police finally told her the identity of the attacker, she could not believe it. ‘I couldn’t eat for days,’ she said. ‘I didn’t want to believe it, it didn’t make sense. ‘I even asked maybe did she send someone to come after me. They looked at me like, “You still don’t get it. She is the person under the veil,” and I cried, I cried and cried.’ The Metropolitan Police said in a statement: ‘The investigation was complex and officers had a duty to explore every avenue of inquiry. ‘The CCTV evidence took some time to analyse but then clearly showed a veiled suspect trailing the victim. ‘Konye was arrested as the investigation progressed.’ CCTV footage obtained by police after the attack showed a figure in a niqab following her as she left work at the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford at around 11.30pm .

"By . Claire Ellicott . Jordan Daly, 16, from Innerleithen,  suffers from severe hereditary multiple exostoses (HME) which causes painful bone tumours to grow over her body . Like most 16-year-old girls, Jordan Daly loves make-up and painting her nails. But behind the pretty exterior lies a gruelling daily fight against a rare and painful condition. Jordan suffers from severe hereditary multiple exostoses (HME), which causes agonising bone tumours to grow all over her body. The hook-shaped growths can form at the end of any bone or joint, which then dig in to the muscles and tendons, causing constant pain she likens to a knife wound. There is no cure for the genetic condition and the slightest knock can trigger a growth. With dozens of thumb-sized tumours on her shoulders, arms, legs, knees, and feet, even getting up from a chair, eating and breathing can be excruciating. To add to her pain, pupils at her school bullied her with cruel jibes of ‘freak’ and ‘squint legs’. From as young as seven she was targeted by bullies who taunted her about her illness and her surgical scars where bone had been removed, and even beat her up. Now the teenager, who is studying for her Higher English at home as she is too weak to attend school, has written a blog about growing up with HME in an attempt to let other youngsters see that it is acceptable to be different. Jordan, from Innerleithen, Peeblesshire, who has endured years of surgery to remove the bony lumps, said: ‘When young children don’t understand something, they either ignore it or hurt it. 'It was awful at the time because I didn’t understand why they were so against me. I ended up starving myself as a way of punishing myself because after a while you actually start to believe that you’re not worth it.’ Jordan, pictured on her first birthday, was four when her parents first spotted a lump on one of her joints. She has since developed dozens more boney growths . Jordan, pictured during a school sports day, bruises incredibly easily and even the five minute walk to school can be a struggle . Jordan was four when her parents, Gordon and Sheila, first noticed a lump on one of her joints. A year later she had her first operation to remove the bony growth. Since then she has developed dozens more, many of which have regrown even after surgery. A knock to her arm or leg is enough to cause a growth to appear. They can also cause her hips and knee joints to lock, leaving her in severe pain and immobile. She also suffers from Von Willebrand disease, where her blood does not clot properly. This means she bruises easily and every operation is a risk. Jordan is in so much pain even taking her little brother, Logan, five, the five-minute walk to school can be a challenge. Trying to lead a normal life: Jordan is in constant pain because of her condition . Outlet: Jordan has now started a blog about her experience . She said: ‘Sometimes even moving from a chair is quite difficult due to the pain. It’s excruciating when I breathe in and sometimes when I wake up I can’t breathe because the spurs cause the muscles and tendons to tighten.’ Despite her pain, she wants to help other children bullied for their differences realise they are not alone. In her blog, Jordan urges them to read her story and realise things are not as bad as they seem. She said: ‘I want other children to see they don’t have to put up walls. Even though some people will be cruel, not all will be. They need to have faith in themselves and not let people bring them down.’ Her mother, an account manager, said: ‘She’s a walking miracle. She was born nine weeks early. She died twice and had to be ventilated and we were told she would probably never walk or talk.’ To read Jordan’s blog click here.

It's a hard life: Officials from up to 68 British councils enjoy the sun in Cannes, France, with a cold beer at the MIPIM 2014 property conference . Property developers and investment banks hosted champagne receptions on yachts, and stalls in the conference centre offered wine and canapes to passing visitors. Not to be outdone, the 235 local council representatives took over bars and restaurants and partied the long, warm nights away. One told the Daily Mail: ‘This certainly beats working. I’ve sent pictures of the beach to my partner telling her I’m working hard.’ During the day, attendees enjoyed long rosé-fuelled business lunches of huge plates of seafood. The cost of rooms in Cannes last week was such that many private sector workers had to stay in cheaper destinations down the coast. By Tuesday there was not a room to be had in any of the hotels in the entire city or a seat in any of its expensive restaurants. Most councils sent only two or three representatives, but there were some notable exceptions. Leicester and Leicestershire Enterprise Partnership sent 11, the same number as the City of London Corporation. The enterprise partnership for Derby, Derbyshire, Nottingham and Nottinghamshire sent 20, and Sheffield City Council and Sheffield City Region sent ten. Soak up the sun: Two officials from Manchester seem to be getting in to the swing of the event - which sees hundreds enjoy long, rose-fuelled business lunches with platters of seafood . The Marketing Manchester quango sent 16 people, while Manchester City Council sent three. The Manchester delegation, which also included representatives of Manchester International Festival, had its headquarters at a bar in a central location. Free drinks were served on at least one of the nights during a Manchester City game on the bar’s TV. The drinks, like the rent for the bar, were funded by private sector partners. The council’s chief executive Sir Howard Bernstein and some staff stayed at the luxurious Gray d’Albion hotel, where rooms can cost £400 a night, paid for by the organisers of the event. The Manchester delegation later hosted a private party paid for by the private sector at a villa in another prime Cannes spot. Earlier that day it hosted a reception for footballer-turned-property developer Gary Neville at which he announced plans to build a hotel with former teammate Ryan Giggs. Wish you were here? Officials would enjoy a day of eating, drinking, and closing deals at the marina (pictured) Team Nottingham, the delegation from Nottingham, took over as its headquarters the top floor of a bar overlooking the beach, paid for by private sector partners. Manchester City Council said the cost of its attendance to the taxpayer was £50,000 but claimed the return in private sector support would be five times higher. A council spokesman said: ‘Manchester, in common with all of Europe’s major cities including London whose presence was led by the Mayor of London, sent a private-public delegation with over 50 companies to MIPIM to attract investment and jobs.’ Jonathan Isaby of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘This conference is little more than a fancy taxpayer-funded get-together for council officers and companies in the French Riviera. When councils are putting up taxes and failing to cut waste, many residents will wonder why on earth they are paying to send this many local politicians on a jolly to Cannes. ‘If this so-called conference is of such benefit to local businesses then they would surely be happy to fund the entire trip themselves, rather than relying on hard-pressed residents for more money.’ Plain sailing: Members of the conference do business over drinks aboard a yacht moored in the marina .","Officials from 68 councils and quangos attended conference in Cannes .

"By . Rebecca Camber . and Jack Doyle . and Claire Ellicott . A Mafia don who has spent 20 years hiding in Britain cannot be deported to Italy because cramped prison conditions would breach his human rights, a judge ruled yesterday. Domenico Rancadore has been living quietly in a London suburb since 1994 despite being sentenced to seven years in jail in his home country for running a branch of the Mafia involved in extortion, racketeering and drug trafficking. But yesterday, Senior District Judge Howard Riddle ruled that Rancadore – one of Italy’s most wanted men – cannot be extradited due to a European Court of Human Rights ruling upheld in the High Court last week that chronic overcrowding in Italian jails breaches human rights laws. Domenico Rancadore and his wife Anne leaving Westminster Magistratess Court in London. Mr Rancadore, 65, who spent nearly 20 years living a secret life on the run in suburban Uxbridge, walked free today after the shock ruling . Ncknamed 'The Professor', he was sentenced to seven years prison in Italy in 1999 in absence for his role as 'a man of honour' in the Cosa Nostra . The couple left court with their faces covered by scarves, after a Judge ruled that Rancadore will not be extradited back to Italy . Rancadore, who appeared in the dock wearing the same blue shirt and grey cardigan he has worn throughout, showed little emotion as he heard the ruling . Mr Rancadore used a bag containing files and books to shield his face, while his wife walked beside him with her face covered by a scarf . At Westminster magistrates’ court, . Judge Riddle said he had planned to deport the feared 65-year-old . because he was satisfied the fugitive’s extradition was ‘compatible with . the defendant’s Convention rights, including prison conditions’. But . his hands were tied by a High Court ruling last week when judges . decided a Somalian businessman accused of unauthorised financial . activity could not be sent to Italy due to a Strasbourg judgment that . Italian prisons violated Article 3 of the Human Rights Act that prevents . torture, inhuman or degrading treatment. Yesterday . critics expressed astonishment. Peter Cuthbertson, director of the . Centre for Crime Prevention think tank, said: ‘These rulings and our . soft justice system only encourage foreign terrorists and criminals to . travel to Britain.’ Tory MP . Dominic Raab said: ‘It shows what a shambles EU law is in this area. We . have innocent British citizens being carted off under the European . Arrest Warrant to face flawed justice systems or gruesome jails abroad. But we can’t send foreign gangsters back home.’ Prosecutor . Benjamin Seifert had told the court how Rancadore was sentenced in his . absence to seven years in prison in Italy in 1999. He fled to Britain in 1994 and was living as a celebrity chauffeur under the name Marc Skinner - the maiden name of his wife's mother - with his wife and two children . He has now returned home on bail after a judge at Westminster Magistrates ruled his extradition to Italy should be blocked . He will be electronically tagged and a curfew was set between 10am and 2pm and again between 10pm and 2am . He . said: ‘Mr Rancadore was one of the heads of an armed criminal . organisation known as Cosa Nostra which is said to be one of the most . powerful Mafia organisations in Italy, made up of thousands of members . spreading terror in Sicily by imposing its rules and controlling the . area and systematically murdering anybody who did not comply with the . will of the members of the organisation.’ But . to the surprise of Italian police who had been hunting for him since . 1994, Rancadore was living in a bungalow in Uxbridge with his wife and . two children until he was arrested last August by Scotland Yard. Yesterday . Judge Riddle said he was satisfied by assurances from the Italian . Ministry of Justice that Rancadore would not be held in an overcrowded . cell if he were to be sent back to face justice. But . last week Lord Justice McCombe and Mr Justice Hickinbottom ruled in a . separate case that in the face of ‘a systemic failure of a state’s . prison system’, assurances given by Italian authorities were . insufficient to persuade them that there was no risk prison conditions . would breach human rights. Judge . Riddle said: ‘The judgment of the [High] court is binding on me. For . these reasons Mr Rancadore is discharged.’ The Italian authorities now . have the right to appeal the decision. After . seven months in custody, Rancadore – said to have a serious heart . condition – was bailed on a £20,000 surety and told to report to . Uxbridge police station daily. His wife said: ‘He’s happy to be home. This isn’t finished yet. This is just the beginning, isn’t it.’ Rancadore’s . solicitor, Karen Todner, said: ‘Mr Rancadore has been very . misrepresented in the Press thus far. He made a deliberate decision 20 . years ago to walk away from the Mafia and all that is associated with . it. He has led a blame-free existence in the United Kingdom.’ Mafia fugitive Domenico Rancadore, 65, has won his battle against extradition back to Italy . For 20 years, he lived quietly in a modest bungalow in a west London suburb, attracting little notice from his neighbours who knew him as Marc Skinner, a ‘reserved and polite’ father of two. But back in his home country, Domenico Rancadore’s name inspired terror in the hearts of his victims, who described him as the mob godfather running one of the most  dangerous factions of the Mafia. According to former prison chaplain Father Gino Sacchetti, Rancadore’s mob was responsible for a series of a sickening attacks in a campaign of intimidation including nailing a dead lamb to his front door, firebombing his car and posting bullets to him. The priest was targeted in the late Eighties after he spoke out against organised crime in Sicily. He said: ‘I knew Rancadore was involved in the threats against me – he sent two local brothers to threaten me.’ The brothers were arrested but Rancadore was already on the run. Father Sacchetti had angered mob bosses by refusing to sell prime land which they wanted to use for a luxury development, and they were further outraged when he said he would instead open a shelter for drug addicts on the outskirts of Palermo – the heartland of Rancadore and his henchmen. A note sent with the bullets read: ‘The first is for your heart, the second for your head, the third for the coup de grace. This is your final warning.’ The 64-year-old, who is wanted to serve a seven-year jail term after he was convicted in 1999 of Mafia association and extortion in Trabia, near Palermo, was arrested on two European arrest warrants last August . The priest recalled: ‘I had the lamb . nailed to my front door at the church where I worked. Rancadore was said . to be behind it. It was a horrific sight – there was a note pinned to . it which read “You will end up the same way”. They wanted to scare me . but they were not going to put me off my work.’ Born in Palermo, Sicily, in 1949, Rancadore was the son of a Mafia boss called Giuseppe, who was later jailed for life. He . worked as a PE teacher and was fondly known as ‘the professor’ before . turning to crime. Italian police say he was involved in the Mafia Wars . of 30 years ago. He was . known as a ‘man of honour’ in the Cosa Nostra group which controlled the . Trabia district of Palermo where it was said that he collected bribes . from builders and was considered so powerful he enjoyed kickbacks on a . government contract. Anne Skinner, the wife of Domenico Rancadore, arrives for the extradition hearing at Westminster Magistrates Court today . Mrs Skinner was born Anna Maria Culcasi Macaluso, the daughter of an Italian Consul, but changed her name by deed poll . Speaking with a perfect English accent, she told the court they had married in 1976 and had lived in Sicily, before coming to England in 2004 .

"By . Claire Ellicott . We've heard all the excuses about leaves on the line, or the wrong kind of snow. But Southeastern Trains have come up with a new reason for cancelling journeys: the staff have gone to Sainsbury's. A rush hour service from London to Hastings was cancelled on Tuesday because the guard could not be found. (File picture) Passengers on a rush hour service from London to Hastings had their service cancelled because the guard could not be found . He was later spotted in Sainsbury's, but refused to get on the train because he was having his break so the next train was cancelled. Finally – and with three train loads of passengers on one train – the service departed, delaying commuters by at least an hour. Customers branded the experience a 'nightmare' and said Southeastern fares were a 'rip-off' while MPs criticised the company's 'poor customer service'. It is just the latest debacle for the railway line, which was voted the worst for passenger satisfaction earlier this year. It also raised fares by 2.8per cent two months ago. Last night, commuter Julia Harris branded Southeastern services – which costs her £2,850 for six months travel between London and Hastings – a 'rip-off'. The civil servant and mother-of-one had been returning home from work in Leeds to get a connection in London to Hastings. (File picture) The guard was seen going into a branch of Sainsbury's for his lunch . She was supposed to get the 7.23pm train from London Bridge, but this was cancelled. She then got on the 7.53pm train, but this was delayed as the guard had 'gone missing'. Half an hour later, the driver told passengers that they had now located the guard who had been delayed on another train but said that he was in Sainsbury's and had decided to take his break. The train was then cancelled and the passengers loaded on to another train. Mrs Harris said: 'No one on that train had had a break in as long as they can remember. They had been on the go from the crack of dawn. 'We were sat there thinking: “how much of a break does this guy need? How labour intensive is his job really? When was the last time I had ten minutes to pop to Sainsbury's for my lunch? Or did I take sandwiches because I can't actually leave my desk?” So he had no sympathy.' 'There were three trainloads of people on one train. We were more than an hour delayed and everyone was squashed in like sardines. Everyone just went crazy. It was a nightmare. 'It's such a rip-off and such a poor service.' Earlier this year, Southeastern finished joint bottom of a Which? survey for passenger satisfaction, with just 40per cent of commuters saying it runs a good service. The railway line, which runs services from Kent and east Sussex into London, was also given just one out of five stars for 'value for money' journeys. But it argued that the reason passengers did not rate its service was because it took them to work. It said that it was prone to perform badly in passenger surveys because it 'takes people somewhere they don't want to be with money they don't want to pay'. And after being slated for its decision to raise fares by 2.8 per cent, a spokesman said: 'When your council tax demand arrives nobody fires off a cheque with pleasure'. He also said that if the surveys were carried out on a 'sunny summer's day' they would fare better as passengers would be more 'upbeat'. Amber Rudd MP, whose constituency of Hastings and Rye is served by Southeastern, said the company offered 'poor customer service' and were 'disappointing'. She said: 'My constituents understand that extraordinary weather has caused infrastructure damage. What they can't understand is the lack of clear information and poor customer service that they receive from Southeastern. 'It has been a very disappointing experience. Southeastern must up their game if they want to get their franchise renewed.' Last night, a spokesperson from Southeastern said: 'We're really sorry to customers caught up in the problems last night. We're looking into what happened – we can certainly understand passengers' anger here. 'While frustrating for people who rightly just want to get home, anyone working in safety critical roles are required to take breaks after working a certain amount of hours. 'The shift timing was thrown out of place because of a knock-on effect of earlier delays, and we didn't have a standby conductor available to work the train in his place. 'We'd encourage all passengers caught up in the problems to claim for compensation for the delay. Information about how to claim is available on our website.'","Rush hour service from London to Hastings was cancelled .

In a hearing at London’s High Court, which lasted barely a minute, District Judge Gibson granted the couple a decree nisi - the first legal step to ending their two-year marriage. Mr Ferry, 68, and former PR girl Miss Sheppard 31, now have to wait for a decree absolute, which is usually issued six weeks and a day later, ending their marriage. Neither the couple nor their legal representatives attended the hearing. Court paperwork shows that Miss Sheppard applied to divorce Mr Ferry on the grounds of his continuing unreasonable behaviour. The marriage was said to have irretrievably broken down. On the petition before court, Miss Sheppard ticked ‘Yes’ to the question: ‘Is the respondent’s behaviour as set out in your petition continuing?’ The former PR worker also confirmed in the document that they were living apart. The document was signed on January 16. The pair married in a simple private ceremony at the Amanyara luxury beach resort on the Turks and Caicos Islands in 2011. Before their nuptials, Mr Ferry had said he was ‘fortunate’ to have snared himself a younger girlfriend. He said: ‘The interesting thing is - and I don’t want to say the wrong thing in case I get into trouble with my girlfriend - you never really meet people your own age who aren’t married. ‘I’m very fortunate that I work in music, where you’re in touch with different age groups, either the audience or people you work with.

Former Southampton chairman Nicola Cortese has warned his old club not to sell any of their young talent while insisting the likes of Luke Shaw wouldn't be leaving this summer if he was still in charge. Cortese left the club after being slowly forced out by owner Katharina Liebherr, shortly after he had persuaded manager Mauricio Pochettino to stay at Southampton. Now, with Shaw the subject of a rumoured £27m bid from Manchester United and Adam Lallana looking for a move to Liverpool, Southampton look increasingly likely to lose their young stars who have been so instrumental to their rise through the leagues.

Cortese told BBC Sport: 'We created those talents. It was key to keep them. 'You don’t produce them just to sell, otherwise you give away your ambition.'

Cortese also believes that the Southampton youngsters will be reluctant to leave the club. He added: 'I knew the players themselves wanted to stick together because this vision was something they believed in, too. I didn’t see any reason for them to go. 'I didn’t have written offers, but I obviously had phone calls. My answer was that it was not going to happen for at least the next two seasons. 'The other chairmen respected that.

"By . Ashley Clements . Follow @@Ashley_Clements . Manchester City became only the second team to score 100 Premier League goals on Wednesday night as Manuel Pellegrini's side reached the landmark with a 4-0 win against Aston Villa. Many had predicted that City's firepower would ensure a stroll towards this year's Premier League title and although it hasn't been quite that simple, the century of goals is a huge reason why the Manchester team have one hand of the trophy with one game to play. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at just how City have reached 100 goals and why they look on course to break Chelsea's record of 103 (they only need to score four against West Ham, after all). VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's candidates for manager of the year . Vital: Yaya Toure has scored 20 of Manchester City's 100 Premier League goals . Emphatic: Toure scored City's 100th league goal of the season with this striker against Aston Villa . Yaya Toure - 20 goals . The driving force. The heartbeat. Whatever you want to call him, it's no understatement to say City would be nowhere near the Premier League summit without Toure's goals and his ability to drive his team forward when they need him most. The 30-year-old is City's top scorer this season and has added free-kicks to his far-ranging list of skills, scoring five set pieces this term. Driving force: The Ivorian has scored some vital goals for City including this one against Manchester United . Sergio Aguero - 17 goals . City would surely be closer to the 120 goal mark for the season if the diminutive Argentine forward had steered clear of injuries. Undoubtedly one of the best strikers in the world, Aguero has missed huge chunks of football but has still bagged 17 goals for his side and has been a huge factor to their success. Forward thinking: Sergio Aguero has bagged 17 goals to add to City's century of goals . In and out: City and Aguero would no-doubt have more goals if it wasn't for Aguero's injury record . Edin Dzeko - 16 goals . Somehow, Dzeko isn't a fan favourite at the Etihad despite popping up with hugely important goals throughout the season. The Bosnian striker is seen as a third choice behind Aguero and Alvaro Negredo, but he has scored four crucial goals in the past week alone to help City defeat both Everton and Aston Villa while leading the line admirably in Aguero's absence. Alvaro Negredo - 9 goals . 'The Beast' looked as though he was going to be one of the signings of the season after hitting the ground running and finding the net on several occasions at the start of the campaign. The Spanish striker's goals may have dried up of late but nine is his first season in English football isn't a bad return and one he'll be looking to build on next season. Double: Edin Dzeko has scored some pivotal goals for City including two against Villa on Wednesday . Helping hand: Alvaro Negredo (left) has picked up nine goals while David Silva has added seven . David Silva - 7 goals . The Spanish maestro usually finds himself at the centre of everything good for City and Silva has certainly been one of City's standout players. The 28-year-old can take huge credit from the fact that City have scored 100 goals scoring seven and setting up nine for his team-mates. Samir Nasri - 6 goals . Nasri has been in inspired form during some important periods for his club and has popped up with vital goals against the likes of Manchester United and Southampton. The Frenchman, like Silva, has also been crucial in setting up goals for his team-mates and has picked up seven assists for the season . Every little helps: Samir Nasri has chipped in with six goals, but also has seven assists to his name . Fernandinho - 5 goals . It's not really his job, but the Brazilian summer signing has chipped in with five goals from his deep-lying midfield role. Fernandinho has been the perfect foil for Tour in the centre of the pitch this season with the pair forming what must be one of the most powerful midfield duos in the Premier League. Jesus Navas - 4 goals . The flying winger has been in and out of the City first team for his fledgling year in England, but a return of four goals and seven assists has been a good start to his Etihad career. Strike: Fernandinho celebrates scoring during City's 6-3 win against Arsenal earlier in the season . Debut: Jesus Navas has picked up four goals during his first season in English football . Stevan Jovetic - 3 goals . After missing the majority of the season with injury, Jovetic has slowly started to look the part in a Sky Blue shirt. The striker will be hoping to score far more than three goals next season, however, as City's strikeforce grows ever stronger. Vincent Kompany - 3 goals . The City captain has had another brilliant season at the heart of defence and has been one of Pellegrini's key men. If your team is going to reach 100 Premier League goals, strikes from defenders are vital and he has scored three times to help reach the target. Three and easy: Stevan Jovetic celebrates scoring his third goal of the season during City's win against Villa . Nearly there: Jovetic scores City's 99th Premier League goal of the season . From the back: Vincent Kompany (left) and Martin Demichelis have also helped City towards 100 . Martin Demichelis - 2 goals . The Argentine had a rocky start to his career, but Demichelis has stepped up to the plate to become Kompany's most trusted lieutenant and he's grabbed two goals for his side. Pablo Zabaleta, Aleksandar Kolarov, James Milner - 1 goal each . Own goals - 5 . Solo: Pablo Zabaleta celebrates scoring his only goal of the season during City's win against West Brom .

Raikkonen was naturally unhappy, and although avoiding losing his temper, has simply urged Ferrari to clean up their act and help him through what has so far been a troubled return. Raikkonen said: 'The plan was to go out, but the team said ""no, you are fine, you do not need to go out"". 'I questioned it a few times, but they said no need, and we can see the end result. 'What happened is not good for me or the team, and although it has been a difficult year I don't see the point to shout. The mistake is done. 'I've made mistakes in the past, I will make them in the future, and people do make mistakes, but there are things we have to change to improve.

We are here as a team, make decisions as a team, and today the outcome was this. 'Obviously we have to improve, to do things differently because we can see there are weaknesses in the system.'

The 34-year-old maintains, however, that despite his problems, what is occurring has no bearing on his future. 'It will not influence my decision,' said Raikkonen. 'I've a contract, I fully believe in Ferrari, I've enjoyed a lot of wins and success with them. On track: Jules Bianchi will start Siunday's race ahead of Raikkonnen after Ferrari's error . 'It's been a difficult year, which is life. It's not fun when you have hard times, it's happened before and that's how it goes. 'We try to improve things, try to make things better all the time, make less mistakes, get the car where I want it to be to be fast again. 'I've not suddenly over the winter lost a few seconds lap time, so it's the case of putting things in the right places for me. 'Unfortunately we haven't managed to do it now and then, we are still fighting against things a lot, and the results show. 'If it were easier, as sometimes it goes, then we would be laughing, but that was not the case today, and has not been the case this year. 'As I say, I trust in the team, but there have to be changes and improvements, which can only happen if we work as a team, as a group, as Ferrari.'","Raikkonen was told he didn't need to improve his time in qualifying .

Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff is still due to attend this weekend's Hungarian Grand Prix despite sustaining a number of fractures in a cycling accident on Tuesday. On a team-bonding exercise along the river Danube in Vienna, several members of the F1 team - but not including drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg - were involved in the incident.

Heading to Silverstone trailing Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg by 29 points after a run of races that had left him playing catch-up, the 29-year-old emerged with the best result possible. Despite yet another mistake in qualifying as an error of misjudgement left him starting sixth to Rosberg's pole, Hamilton came away with a vital victory, whilst the 29-year-old German retired.

'Winning at Silverstone was just an incredible feeling - for myself, the team and the fans, I couldn't have asked for more,' said Hamilton. 'I feel like I've been on the back foot all year, only briefly leading the championship despite taking the wins I've had, so to have got myself just about level was exactly what I needed. 'It's almost a fresh start heading into the second half of the season and it's going to be a really close battle between us. 'There were lots of positives to take from Silverstone. Knowing I'm going into the next race with the best car, having shown I've good pace and knowing if I do a good job I can be ahead, is a good place to be.' Rosberg knows the momentum he had built up since Monaco has evaporated in the space of one race and his first retirement of the year after finishing in the top two in the opening eight grands prix. Approaching what he considers to be his second home race this season, along with Monaco, Rosberg said: 'Although it wasn't the result I wanted in the end, my weekend in Silverstone was really encouraging in a lot of ways.

'I lost a lot of points and the championship battle is very close, but I'm feeling good and I'm really focused on getting a top result this weekend. 'Hockenheim is actually the circuit where I've won the most races during my career through all the junior categories, so I know it suits my driving style.

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Mercedes stand on the brink of making Formula One history on Sunday after again leaving their rivals in the shade in practice for the Canadian Grand Prix. For the 11th time in 20 practice sessions this season, Lewis Hamilton finished top of the timesheet, spearheading a one-two with team-mate Nico Rosberg who had to settle for second best at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. If there is a repeat of that order in the race, or even a reversal should Rosberg get the better of Hamilton for the second successive event, Mercedes will earn a place in the sport's history books. On track: Lewis Hamilton was fastest in Montreal on Friday ahead of this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix . Magic in Montreal: The 29-year-old Briton has triumphed on three previous occasions in Canada . No team in F1's 64-year existence has scored six successive one-twos, with Mercedes currently equal with Ferrari on five who have twice managed the feat, in 1952 and again in 2002. Despite Rosberg's contentious win in Monaco a fortnight ago which led to a fall-out between the German and Hamilton, the latter is red-hot favourite to strike back quickly. Hamilton has triumphed on three previous occasions in Montreal, and has also scored a trio of poles in his seven events at the circuit. For once, come the conclusion to the two 90-minute practice outings, there was a reasonable gap between the duo. Title battle: Rosberg leads Hamilton in the championship by four points ahead of this weekend's grand prix . Picture perfect: Kevin Magnussen takes on the hairpin during practice for round seven of the championship . Hamilton clocked a time on the fastest of Pirelli's tyre rubber, the supersoft compound, of one minute 16.118secs, with Rosberg 0.175secs adrift. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, who was quickest in FP1, had to settle for fifth overall at the end of the day, with the Spaniard 0.583secs off the pace. Reigning four-times champion Sebastian Vettel in his Red Bull and Kimi Raikkonen for Ferrari were ahead of the Spaniard, both around half-a-second behind. Life in the fast lane: Reigning champion Sebastian Vettel was third fastest on Friday . The Williams' pairing of Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas thrust themselves into top-10 contention, similarly the McLarens of Kevin Magnussen and Jenson Button. Just seven thousandths of a second separated the latter duo, who were the last of the drivers to come within a second of Hamilton's pace. Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne repeated his feat in FP1 of finishing 10th in the second session, but a full second adrift. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, third in the last two races, was down in a surprising 12th, not just 1.5secs behind Hamilton, but a second off of team-mate Vettel. Max Chilton performed strongly to claim 18th in his Marussia, with the Briton 2.5secs adrift. However, two of the drivers behind him in Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat and Jules Bianchi in his Marussia encountered issues that curtailed their running ends .","No team in Formula One history has recorded six straight 1-2 finishes .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Pastor Maldonado is not expecting his current bitter frustration to ease over the course of this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix. Six grands prix into his maiden campaign with Lotus - after spending two seasons at Williams - Maldonado currently finds himself at the foot of the 22-driver championship table. The team's problems have been numerous, but Maldonado appears to have encountered his fair share, initially retiring in the first two races in Australia and Malaysia. Frustartion: Pastor Maldonado currently finds himself bottom of the F1 championship table . After at least seeing the chequered flag in the three grands prix that followed in China, Bahrain and Spain, with a high of 14th, a new low then arose in Monaco where Maldonado failed even to start. Normally renowned for his strong performances around the streets of the principality, Maldonado said: 'I was very disappointed because I was expecting to be in the points and the car did feel strong. 'The chances in Monaco are always very high, and I was ready to do a great race, but unfortunately it was not to be. 'As you saw, we were not the only team to have technical problems at the last race, however we just need to work harder to try to solve all of the small issues and get better with each race. 'They are frustrating, absolutely, but we are getting stronger and stronger each time the car goes out on track.' At present the normally volatile Venezuelan is remaining calm as he added: 'When you have a hard time it is vital to be completely focused on trying to solve the problems. 'I'm trying to do better from my side and also to help the engineers improve the car. 'This is a crucial moment for the team, approaching the middle of the season. We need to push very hard to recover what we lost at the beginning. 'We always knew it was going to be tough to start with, but the key is not to panic. 'We'll just keep our heads down and quietly work harder, do more and do better to catch up, and overtake the other teams. 'We're capable of it, there's no doubt about that, and while it's always frustrating not to be on the podium where we belong, this is part of the story. 'It's very easy to just give up, but I think it will make us stronger in the end. 'There's a cool quote I heard - 'there's no shortcut to any place worth going'. That's pretty true I think.' Speed: Maldonado drives his Lotus during qualifying in Monaco . Bad luck: Maldonado walks in the pits at Monaco after failing to start the race . Unfortunately for Maldonado, points - never mind a podium - may again be hard to come by in Montreal this weekend as the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve does not suit the current Lotus. 'Top speed and slow corners are probably the weakest points of our car now, and unfortunately Canada has long straights followed by low-speed corners,' said Maldonado. 'It could be a difficult weekend for the team. We are not expecting to be at the top, simply because of the type of track and how we understand our car and its performance strengths and weaknesses. 'But anything can happen and our guys are all working very hard to adapt the car to find more traction in the slow corners and squeeze out some more top speed.'","Maldonado at the bottom of the championship table after six races .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Daniel Ricciardo believes finishing ahead of Sebastian Vettel in this year's Formula One world championship would prove to be a real feather in his cap. Back-to-back third-place finishes in the last two grands prix behind dominant Mercedes pair Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg have elevated Red Bull's Ricciardo into fourth place in the drivers' standings. Centre of attention: Daniel Ricciardo claims finishing above Sebastian Vettel would boost his confidence . Reigning four-times champion Vettel, meanwhile, has suffered gremlins this year and is now nine points adrift of Ricciardo, promoted from Toro Rosso at the end of last season as replacement for Mark Webber. Despite the regulation changes over the winter, not many would have put good money on the 24-year-old Australian having the edge over Vettel so far, but that is how the season is panning out. Naturally, Ricciardo is aware of the kudos he would gain should he still be ahead of Vettel come the conclusion to the season in Abu Dhabi. 'It . wouldn't be a bad thing. It would give me a lot of confidence,' said . Ricciardo, speaking ahead of this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix that was . won by Vettel 12 months ago. 'In . saying that, I've probably already done enough to show the guys I can . do it, and when I say 'can do it', not specifically beat Seb, but to . race at the front, be in a top team, and deserve to be here. 'Whatever happens in the championship, the final result, unless we win then it's probably not going to matter. 'They . (the team) will probably look at specific races in the year and say 'in . this one he did well', or 'in this he did quite well'. It would be a . nice pat on the back I guess.' I'm still smiling: Vettel has won the F1 title in the last four years but has struggled to hit the front this term . Bearing in mind Vettel has never finished behind a team-mate since he entered F1 in 2007, Ricciardo insists there is no magic to what he has achieved so far, just unwavering confidence in himself. 'It's important for me to try to learn from him (Vettel), and I'd be silly not to because he's obviously the best in the world, so I can't be stubborn about that,"" added Ricciardo. 'At the same time I work well when I focus on myself. If I get distracted too much with what Seb is doing then it takes my mind off what I need to be doing. On the march: Ricciardo (right) has leaped to fourth in the championship following his third place at Monaco . Surprise: Ricciardo has exceeded expectations by leading Vettel in the championship . 'I have a lot of belief in my ability, and I know if I do everything I can to my best then the results will come. 'At the moment 95 per cent is directed towards myself, and then on the side, if I can learn a bit from Seb, then I do. It's trying to do what I know first and then worry about the rest later.'","Red Bull driver fourth place in championship standings after six races .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff concedes he is under pressure to prevent the feud between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg from boiling over, but is confident he can keep a lid on the situation. The duelling drivers head into this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal with Hamilton claiming he and Rosberg are 'still friends' in the wake of their recent fall-out in Monaco. Discussions have taken place between them, with more planned prior to the events at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve to ensure there is no repeat of the scenes witnessed at Monte-Carlo. Thumbs up for now: Mercedes boss Toto Wolff (left) celebrates Nico Rosberg's (right) Monaco grand prix win but has admitted difficulties in managing the German's rivalry with Lewis Hamilton . Frosty: Rosberg (centre) and Hamilton (left) barely acknowledged each other on the Monaco podium . Taste of victory: Rosberg celebrates his win at the Monaco grand prix . Hamilton was left fuming with Rosberg for what he suggested was a deliberate attempt to thwart his final qualifying lap, and so deny him pole position. It proved crucial as Rosberg won from pole, with Hamilton runner-up, resulting in a frosty podium ceremony as neither man acknowledged the other. Whilst non-executive chairman Niki Lauda claims the matter has been resolved, the three-times champion also suggested given the fight for the title between the two 'alpha' drivers, the situation would remain 'tricky' for the rest of the season. As team boss, Wolff knows he is in the spotlight and concedes that 'clearly' he can feel the pressure mounting on his shoulders as the season progresses and incidents occur. 'It is a matter of managing the situation,'said Wolff, 'In our case we adopted the philosophy of letting them race, which as a consequence means management is a bit more difficult. Controversial: Rosberg's car (circled) helped prevent Lewis Hamilton (above) from grabbing pole in Monaco due to the resulting yellow flags . Still mates: Hamilton tweeted a picture of himself and Rosberg to help rebuild the bridges between the rivals . Class of the field: Mercedes have won all six races so far this season, with Hamilton grabbing four of them . 'But I try to be as transparent and as neutral as possible, to give guidance to a situation in a way that it is not detrimental to the team. 'That is because our team, Mercedes, comes first and we will never accept an individual putting themselves above the team. 'Both of them know that, accept it and have adopted that philosophy.'It is why, when asked whether he could keep a lid on the situation, Wolff replied: 'Yes. Absolutely. 'We are managing the team, they are part of the team, part of a very large organisation and I have 110 per cent confidence it will not be to the detriment of the team. 'Monaco was obviously a difficult one, but our sixth win in a row, so let's continue to let them race and hopefully we'll end the season without any incident. 'At the moment we have quite a bit of a margin we can allow ourselves and provide a little bit of entertainment to everybody.' Resolved: Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda says there are no outstanding issues between Rosberg and Hamilton but that their rivalry would remain a tricky one throughout the season . What occurred in Monaco was heightened by the fact Lauda had revealed to an incident in the race beforehand in Spain that had been kept in-house. That was with regard to Hamilton turning up the wick on his engine to qualifying mode to keep Rosberg at bay in the closing stages, going directly against the grain as to what had previously been discussed. Despite Lauda letting the cat out of the bag, Wolff sees no reason to keep Lauda in check also. 'Niki has a very important role in the team,' insisted Wolff. 'He is a three-time world champion, somebody who has great access to Lewis because Lewis accepts Niki's history and Niki's achievements in F1. 'I think Niki probably felt a little bit let down by the emotions (of Hamilton in Spain), and this is why I don't think it was an unguided missile. It was to set the record straight.'","Mercedes team-mates refused to acknowledge each other after Monaco .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Lewis Hamilton would be happy to lift a Coca-Cola can above his head at next month's British Grand Prix providing it is engraved with the word 'First'. After collecting an unusual runner-up trophy after Sunday's Austrian Grand Prix, in a more light-hearted moment post race at the Red Bull Ring, Hamilton bemoaned the bizarre designs of current Formula One silverware. But in turning his attention to his home race at Silverstone on July 6, a race he is naturally desperate to win for a variety of reasons, all Hamilton cares about is he is on the top step of the podium. Second: Hamilton criticised the strange trophy he won in Austria but says he'll take anything that says first . Chase: Hamilton has been behind his team-mate Nico Rosberg too often this season, and needs to start winning . It is now six years since his one-and-only victory on home soil, and with the gap at the top of the drivers' standings to title rival and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg now 29 points, Hamilton knows he has to stop the German's run in front of his own fans. 'Generally, Formula One trophies aren't very good. I was looking back at 2003 and the trophies were awesome. The last few years...' sighed Hamilton. 'Silverstone has a good one, but they don't give it out. You use it and then you give it back. 'But at the end of the day it really doesn't matter what it (the winner's trophy) looks like, so long as it has 'First' on it. 'It could be an old tin can, or a Coca-Cola can with 'First' on it, it really would not matter. 'For Silverstone I cannot really explain how special it would be to win there again. It has been a long time since I did, but when I did it was just unbelievable. 'In 2007 (his debut year) being on pole, that was just such a unique experience. 'You really feel like everyone is with you, like you are doing it together, which is really a strange feeling. Champagne moment: Hamilton was on the podium again in Austria, but knows he has to win at Silverstone . Long wait: The former World Champion hasn't won on home soil for six years . 'Then when I won in 2008 (in the wet), coming through the chicane where people were aquaplaning and going off, I could see the crowds getting up and cheering. 'From the corner of my eye I could still see them cheering, and you never want to disappoint them. 'In some races, when you go there and you don't get the result, they are still so supportive afterwards, telling me 'don't worry, next time'. 'I am really confident I can do it this year. I have the car so there is no reason - and Nico's not the reason - why we should not be able to do it. 'It's coming at the right time. I have had a couple of dodgy races, so I need to get it back to how it should be.' Two retirements for Hamilton, in the opening race in Australia and earlier this month in Canada, have left him playing catch up with Rosberg who has not been out of the top two in the eight races to date. It is slowly getting to the point where Hamilton requires Rosberg's car to suffer a technical glitch of its own to aid his title cause. In the pits: Hamilton has suffered two DNFs this season, leaving him behind his team-mate in the Championship . Diplomatic Hamilton, however, would prefer to suggest it is fortune that has so far been lacking. 'I don't hope for anything. I just need some luck to go my way as I have been unfortunate with the two DNFs (did not finish) I've had,' added Hamilton. 'Saturday (in qualifying) was only my first real mistake of the year, so if that was a bad weekend, to still get a 1-2....you just have to step back. 'You can be angry, but I have never had a car like this where I can fight so well with people, follow people and really be in the race. 'It's incredible what this team have done, and I always need to just step back and be grateful to be a part of it. 'There is still a long way to go, a lot of races, so I really need to pull my socks up and capitalise on my own pace, to use that at the weekends otherwise Nico will have it (the title).'","Hamilton claims trophies 'aren't very good' compared to previous years .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Lewis Hamilton has vowed to reel in Nico Rosberg for a second time in this season's Formula One world title battle after swallowing another bitter pill in Canada. Dicing with Rosberg for the lead of the Canadian Grand Prix, Hamilton was forced to retire after 47 laps with rear-brake failure sparked by the loss of the ERS (energy recovery system). Although the ERS in Rosberg's car also failed, the 28-year-old went on to see the chequered flag, claiming second after being passed by Red Bull's debut winner Daniel Ricciardo two laps from home. End of the road: Lewis Hamilton was forced to retire on lap 47 after suffering a mechanical problem . Actin packed: The Briton had earlier gone side-by-side with Rosberg for the win - his team-mate finished 2nd . It means Hamilton is now 22 points behind Rosberg, a crushing blow after previously clawing back a 25-point deficit from the opening race in Australia where he retired and Rosberg triumphed. 'I did the best I could out there and felt like I was having a strong race, but unfortunately it just wasn't our day,' said Hamilton. 'There was nothing I could do about our issues. We were managing the loss of power, but as soon as I finally made the jump on Nico in the second pit stop, my brakes failed. 'There are no emotions other than I couldn't believe my car stopped and the other didn't, but that's the way it goes. On track: Hamilton insists he will bounce back after his setback in Canada . Listening in: The Briton is hoping to win his second Formula One title this term . 'Two DNFs (did not finish) is not helpful, but there's a long, long way to go. I've caught up before, so I'll catch up again. 'To not finish is disappointing, but there are plenty more races ahead of us this season so let's hope for better fortune.' Previously, Hamilton had to reel off four successive victories to finally edge ahead of Rosberg in the standings. Given the performance of the Mercedes car, despite the gremlins on show at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, Hamilton feels it may take something similarly special. 'Naturally, for the team, I don't want either car not to finish so hopefully we don't have any issues on either car for the rest of the year,' added Hamilton. 'That obviously means I'll have even more work to do to make up the lost ground, probably another four wins, and I'll do what I can to get those. 'We've good tracks coming up, and the one for me is I make sure I win at Silverstone (British Grand Prix on July 6).'","Hamilton trails Rosberg by 22 points after his retirement in Montreal .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Footballers in England are confident the game at its highest levels is clean of the scourge of match-fixing, a survey conducted by international players' union FIFPro has revealed. Over 1,500 players from eight countries - England, Scotland, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Romania and Slovenia - submitted responses to a questionnaire that tested their knowledge about the extent of fixing, approaches to fix matches, sharing inside information and betting rules. It further examined their beliefs in respect of the extent of fixing, the instigators and causes, prevention and education, as well as enquiring as to who they would trust to report information on match-fixing, how they would prefer to report information,and reasons that might prevent them from doing so. Protest: A Nigeria supporter backs his team before the match following allegations of match fixing . Other assessments included their practice in reporting approaches, their likelihood to report information, and their own betting practice. An assumption of the survey was that the majority of players are not involved in match-fixing and would therefore answer truthfully. In England, there were 121 respondents, with 100 of those aged 22 or under, and with 62 playing in the Barclays Premier League. Every player questioned said they had not played in a game that has since been identified as fixed, nor had they been approached in the past 12 months to fix a match, nor did they believe one or more games have been fixed in that period. In England, the survey concluded players' betting against the rules was the primary threat to integrity in the game, with nine from 111 players who responded confirming they had bet on matches. It added, however, the recent cases of alleged external criminal infiltration 'should act as a reminder that a more serious form of match fixing is a threat that cannot be ignored'. There have been a number of high-profile police investigations that have come to light. Arrested: Blackburn's DJ Campbell was arrested in connection with the match-fixing scandal in December . In November 2013, members of an alleged . betting syndicate that included at least three footballers were arrested . on suspicion of fixing games in England. A month later, police arrested six people in connection with an investigation into spot-fixing in English football after a former Premier League defender allegedly told an undercover reporter he had been involved in rigging matches in return for money. Both cases are currently sub judice. In Scotland, from 103 respondents, there was one player who said he had played in a game that has since been identified as fixed, and one who had been approached in the past 12 months to fix a match, but did not report it. Of the 84 players who responded to the question as to whether they had bet against the rules on matches, 27 replied 'yes'. The survey concluded for Scotland the focus of future work should be on the 'dangers of gambling and enabling players to keep within the rules', with 'peer education' encouraged as a useful tool. Investigation: Officers from the National Crime Agency remove documents and equipment from the home of former Portsmouth player Stephen Sodje as they looked into allegations of match-fixing last year . The results in England and Scotland are far removed from a country like Greece where match fixing is deemed as being rife. From 211 players surveyed in Greece, 29 said they had played in a game that has since been identified as fixed; 27 have been approached in the past 12 months to fix a match, with 139 believing one or more games have been fixed in the past 12 months. As part of the 'Don't Fix It' campaign, spearheaded by FIFPro, UEFA and the compilers of the study, Birkbeck University in London, a Good Practice Guide is to be distributed next week to all associations. Dr Andrew Harvey, of the Birkbeck Sport Business Centre, said: 'This survey was the first large-scale attempt to ascertain the views of current players in regards to match-fixing. 'The objective was to better understand the issues that lead to match-fixing, in order to use this knowledge to define the prevention and education programme.' The over-riding message was that better education designed to prevent match-fixing and gambling is required, with each country to work on initiatives and solutions most relevant to their own specific problems.

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Sebastian Vettel is hoping to pop open the champagne on the most-coveted podium in Formula One as he makes a landmark 100th Grand Prix start with Red Bull this weekend. In 99 previous races with the Milton Keynes-based team, Vettel has so far notched up 38 victories and four world titles. However, win No 39 will perhaps require something special to happen. Certainly Red Bull suggested they are closer to the dominant Mercedes duo of Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg following the opening practice sessions in Monaco on Thursday. Eyes on the prize: Sebastian Vettel is hoping for victory No 39 with Red Bull in Monaco this weekend . With power less of a requirement - and Mercedes have shown they have that in abundance - and high down force instead the key ingredient, Red Bull may yet draw closer to Hamilton and Rosberg. The duo still lead the way, separated themselves by just 0.032secs, with Vettel's team-mate Daniel Ricciardo just over two tenths of a second adrift after the opening 90-minute session. Rain affected FP2 in which Ferrari's Fernando Alonso was quickest, albeit two tenths of a second down on Hamilton's time from FP1 as the circuit finally dried and came alive in the dying minutes. Vettel ultimately finished third, just over half a second back in a car in which he now feels far more comfortable. Although Vettel knows Mercedes remain the team to beat, he has not given up hope of finally ending their run of five successive wins and four consecutive one-twos. Run out: Sebastian Vettel was fifth quickest on Thursday's opening practice session . 'Mercedes . were very quick in morning and we see that usually, come Saturday, they . are able to pick up their pace, so we'll try to do the same,' said . Vettel. 'Potentially we are a little closer here, but you know at the moment it's all guessing. 'The big advantage on this track would be that there's not that many straights, but we have to wait and see. 'We were obviously limited on what we could learn in terms of pace and range. 'We know it's quite important to qualify in the front here, so if there is a chance then we have to use it.' Fastest run: Lewis Hamilton ended Thursday's first session marginally faster than Nico Rosberg . As far as Vettel's career goes, now in his sixth year with Red Bull, he concedes the time has flown by, and 'it has been more successful and better than we ever expected'. Looking back at his 99 races with Red Bull, Vettel added: 'In 2009 it was a surprise to have a really competitive car. 'In my first year (with the team) I made mistakes I had to do, as did the team, but it was part of the process of growing together. 'It was very painful to get beaten in the fight for the championship, but after that it has been quite phenomenal. 'It was something that was impossible to expect and very difficult to target because there were so many things that could have happened.' As to when he will taste success again, however, he said: 'This year looks a bit different to previous years. 'But then again we're only five races in, we know the team is strong, and we have been through a lot in our 99 races together. 'I am confident we will get stronger, but the question is how soon.'","World champion is hoping for win No 39 with Red Bull on landmark outing .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Aston Villa fans have requested owner Randy Lerner to orchestrate a quick sale, but to also ensure the new buyer has the club's best interests at heart. After eight years at the helm, Lerner announced on Monday he was now looking to sell up, believing it time to seek 'fresh, invigorated leadership'. Applauded: Aston Villa fans have shown their gratitude towards Randy Lerner but have encouraged a quick sale . After purchasing Villa for £62.6million from Doug Ellis in 2006, it is understood Lerner has slapped a price tag of around £200m on the club, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch appointed to organise the sale. For now Villa, along with manager Paul Lambert, are in limbo. It is why fans behind the Aston Villa Supporters' Trust (AVST) are anxious for Lerner to swiftly move on in order for the club to plan for next season and beyond.

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Formula One fans were left frustrated as second practice ahead of this weekend's Monaco Grand Prix was blighted by wet conditions. A heavy downpour 45 minutes before the start left the drivers kicking their heels in the garage for most of the 90 minutes that followed as they waited for the streets of the principality to dry out. It was not until the closing stages that fans finally had a full complement of cars on the track, at the end of which Fernando Alonso in his Ferrari finished quickest. Fastest: Fernando Alonso was quickest in the drying conditions in Friday's second session at Monte Carlo . Smiles better: The Spanish driver ended the second session on top of the timesheets . With a lap of one minute 18.482secs, however, the Spaniard finished two tenths of a second off the leading times of the day posted by Mercedes duo Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg from FP1. Championship leader Hamilton, aiming to become only the seventh driver in Formula One history to win five consecutive grands prix, posted a time of 1:18.271secs - despite sleeping in - just 0.032secs ahead of Rosberg. Williams' Valtteri Bottas was initially dispatched as a guinea pig seven minutes in, but his one-and-only lap left the Finn reporting the circuit to be 'very slippy'. Although the rain had stopped long before the session had started, no driver was prepared to run the risk of heading out and likely ending up mangled against a barrier. On track: Nico Rosberg battles the damp conditions during Friday's second practice session . Driving force: Hamilton is gunning for his fifth consecutive victory at this weekend's Monaco Grand Prix . Such thoughts, though, did little to appease the spectators in the grandstands, who had paid good money to watch Formula One's blue-riband event as there were catcalls and whistles at the inactivity. It was not until 40 minutes in that Sauber's Adrian Sutil ventured out, doing so on intermediate tyres to counter the damp track. For those opening laps, and as drivers were slowly drip fed into the session, it was a case of tiptoeing carefully bearing in mind road asphalt lacks grip compared to that used on normal motor-racing circuits. With just six minutes remaining, only nine drivers had set a time and then there were almost 20 seconds covering such a small contingent before the rest of the drivers took to the track in the closing stages. Water view: Sebastian Vettel is bidding to build on his impressive outing in Spain where he finished fourth after starting 15th . In FP2, Hamilton was second quickest, 0.419secs behind Alonso, with just three other drivers finishing within a second of the two-times world champion. Reigning four-times title-winner Sebastian Vettel was third on the timesheet in his Red Bull, just over half-a-second back, followed by Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne and then Bottas, 0.939secs down. McLaren's Jenson Button was eighth quickest, 1.239secs off the pace, with Marussia's Max Chilton down in 19th, just over four seconds in arrears. The conditions primarily played havoc with the finishing order as Rosberg was down in 20th, whilst Kimi Raikkonen brought up the rear as Ferrari top and tailed the standings. That, however, was due to a mechanical fault that restricted the Finn to four laps and a gap of 27 seconds to Alonso. It means as far as data is concerned, the teams will primarily rely on their findings from FP1 ahead of final practice on Saturday, with Friday in Monaco the traditional rest day.","Fans aim catcalls and whistles from the grandstands at the inactivity .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Jenson Button does not believe Nico Rosberg will fall prey to Lewis Hamilton's mind games this season. Button knows only too well how Hamilton ticks following their three years together at McLaren from 2010-2012. In what appears to be a clear battle of the Mercedes team-mates for this year's Formula One world title, Hamilton appears to have already started employing psychological tactics with Rosberg. Familiar sight: Lewis Hamilton (right) secured his fourth straight victory in Spain by pipping Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg . Easy street: Hamilton's fourth straight grand prix win sent him top of the drivers' standings . Winning team: Mercedes have won all five races this season so far . Although victorious in the last four grands prix, Hamilton claimed at the end of two of those Rosberg was faster and he was lucky to win in the wake of holding off the German. Button is wondering whether Hamilton is trying to get inside the head of Rosberg and make him doubt his own pace and car. Double duty: Jenson Button was seen recently filming an advert for a sponsor . 'I am sure there will - if there aren't already - be mind games going on. There were a few things he played on me,' said Button. 'It would work on some drivers, whereas others it just makes them stronger because they laugh it off. 'Nico is intelligent to know if Lewis is playing mind games or not, which in some ways could help Nico or harm him. He might just end up getting fed up with it. 'But Lewis is fully of confidence at the moment and he is a fierce competitor when he is like that, even when he is not having a good day.' Whilst Hamilton may also be attempting to draw Mercedes' focus on to himself rather than Rosberg, Button is confident the Brackley-based team will continue to deal an even hand to both of their drivers, as has been the case so far. 'The thing is with that team is because they are going to walk away with it - I know we are only five races in, but they have such a big lead - they're not going to favour just one driver,' added Button. Struggle: Jenson Button finished 11th in the Spanish Grand Prix for McLaren . Best hope? Button hinted that Red Bull have an outside chance of winning in Monaco, with Daniel Ricciardo finishing third in Spain . 'They will let their drivers race because they need to keep the show going, and we need them to keep the show going and let both drivers race. 'So there is no point trying to get the team behind you because they won't. I think they will be very fair, and they need to be for the sport.' With Mercedes dominating the year, with five straight victories and four successive one-twos, Button believes Mercedes could yet make history and become the first team to win every race in a season. 'I would be amazed if another car wins a race this year,' remarked Button. 'Maybe Red Bull might in Monaco (next weekend) because that circuit is not about power. But it is going to be tricky for anyone (other than Mercedes) to win a race, and if they do then they have done a bloody good job catching up.'","Hamilton has won four out of five Formula 1 races this season .

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . and Ian Parkes, Press Association . Bernie Ecclestone insisted that he remains 'confident' as he arrived in court in Munich for the start of his bribery trial, which could see him jailed for 10 years. The Formula One ringmaster arrived by car on Thursday morning and was later pictured flanked by his legal team, lawyers Sven Thomas and Norbert Scharf, in the courtroom prior to proceedings. And the 83-year-old billionaire even cracked a joke about his personal life at the start of proceedings.

Writing on the wall: The 83-year-old billionaire is sure to lose his grip on Formula One if found guilty . The result of the bribery case will . shape the future of Formula One, the billion-dollar sport Ecclestone has . controlled for close on 40 years. At the heart of the 256-page . indictment against Ecclestone is the accusation that he paid a bribe of . £27million to German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky to maintain his control . over Formula One. Prosecutors . say that Gribkowsky therefore steered the sale of the sport to CVC, a . private equity firm that had agreed to retain Ecclestone as F1’s chief . executive when they bought a majority shareholding in 2006. Ecclestone, . 83, denies the accusation, saying he gave money to Gribkowsky to stop . him making false claims about his tax affairs. Gribkowsky was sentenced . to eight-and-a-half years in prison in 2012. Ecclestone has denied wrongdoing and said he was 'shaken down' because Gribkowsky was effectively blackmailing him. 'I'm confident, the sun is shining,' a dark-suited Ecclestone told camera crews jostling to film his entry into the Munich courtroom. With an interpreter at his side, he confirmed the pronunciation of his name and his date of birth to judge Peter Noll. Jail time: The F1 chief is facing 10 years imprisonment if found guilty .

'I like to remember the divorce part,' he said in English. He is accused of giving a $45m (£27.5m; 33m euros) bribe to a German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky to secure the sale of a stake in the F1 business to a company he favoured. The allegation is that by securing the sale of the stake to a company Mr Ecclestone favoured, he would remain in charge of Formula 1 and its commercial rights, broadcast payments and sponsorship deals. Mr Ecclestone admits paying Gerhard Gribkowsky, who is serving a jail sentence for receiving the payment, but has denied any wrongdoing. He says it was a 'shake down' as the banker had been threatening to reveal false details of his tax affairs. The . levity was short-lived as the prosecution read out the details of its . case that he channelled $44 million to former BayernLB banker Gribkowsky . for having helped to safeguard his position as head of Formula One. The . case is due to last until September 16, though the court will sit only . one or two days a week. This will allow Ecclestone to continue to run . F1. At the age of 83, Ecclestone has already made tentative noises with regard to a succession plan, stating last month he has been looking over the past few years for someone to assist and then take over. If found guilty, even if Ecclestone avoids jail time and is instead punished with a severe financial penalty, the writing is on the wall. Donald Mackenzie, co-chairman of F1's current majority shareholders CVC Capital Partners, has already stated Ecclestone will be sacked if convicted. It is understood CVC have tentative plans in place for the worst-case scenario, although they have yet to be revealed.

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Renault engine chief Rob White has backed Mercedes' attempts to crank up the noise in Formula One, but fears there may be consequences to the project. The sport's lack of sound has been a major complaint this year since the introduction of the quieter 1.6-litre V6 turbo-charged power units that have replaced the shrill V8s. In an attempt to increase the decibel level, and so ease concerns of disgruntled race promoters who are a worried about drops in ticket sales and revenue, Mercedes are to trial a device on Wednesday during the second day of a two-day test at Barcelona. Approval: Rob White (right) has backed Mercedes' plan to bring back noise to F1 engines . Fellow power-unit manufacturer Renault have been consulted, with White believing the 'megaphone', as it has been dubbed, 'will work'. 'We are fully involved and engaged in the work that's going on, led by the FIA, and Mercedes have shared their initial results from a dyno test of this device,' said White. 'The FIA have some acoustic consultants who have visited us and have had access to our existing dyno test results, including sound measurements. 'They are doing some further work at our factory as we are in an exploratory phase, trying to respond to the subject. 'We are also conscious of the fact some of what we are experiencing - with respect to the noise - is that it does what it says on the tin. 'It (the power unit) uses less energy. It does so more efficiently so there's less falling out of the back as noise. Testing: Mercedes will be testing their 'megaphone' device, and White believes it will work . Critc: World Champion Sebastian Vettel is among those who have hit out at the quieter engines . 'Of course the Strategy Group (that comprises Ferrari, McLaren, Mercedes, Red Bull, Williams and Lotus) has identified the need to try and do something to improve the perception of the noise. 'As long as you don't do silly things, there may be some potential to make a modest adjustment that makes them a bit louder and sound a bit nicer without in any way compromising the fundamental objectives.' White's concern is given Renault's slow start to the season, as they were plagued with problems in pre-season testing and are only now beginning to atone, is that time and resources are being devoted to a particular subject when all effort should be made on returning to the front. 'This is F1 and there are unintended consequences to be careful of all over the place,' added White. Fans: Promoters are worried that with quieter engines the sport may not attract as many supporters . 'I don't sign up to the opinion they sound horrible. Instead, I feel there is a positive message that has kind of got drowned out. 'My short to medium concern is we mustn't be put in a situation where we take a performance hit relative to our competitors, directly or indirectly as a result of this subject. 'We are very determined to fight our way back to a competitive position and it's important the noise subject doesn't become a drain on that part of the project.'","Promoters are concerned that new 1.6l V6 engines are discouraging fans .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Red Bull team principal Christian Horner feels Sebastian Vettel now has his 'mojo back' following his stunning performance in Spain. The first two days of the Spanish Grand Prix weekend at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya were wretched for the four-times Formula One world champion. Vettel initially missed virtually all of Friday's practice sessions due to his car incurring a simple wiring loom fault that took an age to fix. On track: Sebastian Vettel finished fourth at the Spanish Grand Prix after starting way down in 15th . Laid back: The German appeared in a relaxed mood at this week's two-day test in Barcelona . Then on Saturday he was handed a five-place grid penalty for a gearbox change after losing drive in the early stages of the final part of qualifying. But from 15th on the grid, the 26-year-old German produced a superb drive to finish fourth behind Mercedes duo Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, and team-mate Daniel Ricciardo. 'It was a great performance from him on Sunday. He really went for it,' said team principal Christian Horner. 'He made the strategy work for him, he knew he had to make the passes and I thought it was a fantastic recovery drive. 'With the fastest lap and the way he hunted down the Ferraris, it looked like he had got his mojo back.' Ricciardo, meanwhile, continues to thoroughly impress Horner, with the Australian finishing in the top three - and legitimately so on Sunday - for the first time in his F1 career. Ricciardo did finish second in his home race in March, only to be stripped of the result due to a fuel irregularity with his car. With the 24-year-old under contract, Horner insists Ricciardo will not be leaving the team any time soon, in particular as he has built up a solid partnership with Vettel. 'Dan has done a great job this year and he is so calm in the car,' said Horner. 'He continues to impress us with his speed, his approach, he is enjoying what he is doing. You'll never see him not smiling and it is a pleasure to have him in the team. 'I can't speak highly enough of what Dan has done in the first five races and managing this pairing is a walk in the park compared to previous years, but that's part of the challenge of being a boss.' As to Ricciardo's future, Horner said: 'We've always believed in continuity and stability and Dan's on a long-term contract with the team. 'I think it would be highly unlikely he will be anywhere else next year.'","Sebastian Vettel finished fourth after starting 15th at the Spanish Grand Prix .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Sebastian Vettel has been hit with a five-place grid penalty after Red Bull were forced to change his gearbox. It means the world champion will start 15th for tomorrow's Spanish Grand Prix after losing drive at the start of the final qualifying session, forcing him to pull his ailing Red Bull over to the side of turn three at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya. It was another kick in the teeth for the reigning four-times world champion after missing virtually all of Friday's practice sessions due to his car incurring a wiring loom fault. Blow: Sebastian Vettel has been hit with a five-place penalty after Red Bull were forced to change his gearbox . Asked whether this weekend was a test of his mettle as a driver, Vettel replied: 'Well, I haven't been tested on the track much so far because I haven't driven much. 'It is tough because you would obviously love to get more info about the car, get into a rhythm. 'After missing near enough both practice sessions, I caught up a little in final practice, but then qualifying was tricky. 'In Q3 I left the pits, tried to go up to second (gear), but lost drive. 'I tried third, had third, so I decided to keep going because it is possible to do a lap around here even without second gear. Off track: Vettel stopped on track for the second successive day with a gearbox issue . 'But by turn one I was stuck in fifth gear and couldn't go up or down, I had lost all drive, so had to stop. 'These things happen, but now I just have to do the best I can from the position I am in.' Vettel added: 'With all these reliability issues it's a bit disappointing, and now a bit boring. We've had all sorts of problems this year. 'In practice, unfortunately a very small cable got caught in the wrong place which was impossible to see in putting the car together, but obviously now we know where it belongs. 'Up to that stage you could say we've been lucky because we've never been caught. 'As for today I don't know yet what was the cause. I hope there was no damage to the gearbox otherwise that would mean another penalty for tomorrow.'","Sebastian Vettel will start in 15th for Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix .

The reigning four-times Formula One champion completed just four laps of the opening 90-minute practice session at the Circuit de Catalunya in Barcelona before parking his car on the side of the track. Although the RB10 was returned to the garage on the back of a flat-bed truck, and the team had 50 minutes to work on the issue, it has since been discovered the problem is too complex to fix in one day. Blow: Sebastian Vettel stopped on track after completing only four laps in Friday's opening practice session .

Via their Twitter feed, the team said: 'Due to an electrical problem that has damaged the wiring loom of Car No. 1, Sebastian will not be able to take part in FP2. 'The team will use the time to fix it to be ready for FP3 tomorrow.' Ahead of this weekend's return to action after a recent mini-break, Red Bull opted to change the chassis on Vettel's car. The 26-year-old has so far endured a rough campaign in his bid for a fifth successive title, notably in the last two races being asked to move aside for team-mate Daniel Ricciardo due to a lack of pace. Vettel had hoped the change of chassis would bring with it a change of luck, albeit appreciating there would unlikely be any difference in performance. Tough times: The reigning world champion has endured a miserable start to the new campaign . Time to thing: Vettel reflects on a difficult start to his Spanish Grand Prix weekend as his car is towed away . Instead, the German described it as 'a sanity check', to eradicate any possible demons inside his head he may have associated with his current form. With 33 points from the four grands prix to date, Vettel trails championship leader Nico Rosberg by 46 points. This latest problem is unlikely to alleviate the feeling that things are going against him this season.","Sebastian Vettel completed only four laps before the fault with his Red Bull .

"By . Ian Parkes . Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff feels Lewis Hamilton has proven he has the mental strength to cope with the pressure of this year's Formula One world title fight following his British Grand Prix win. In the wake of Hamilton's misjudgement during qualifying at Silverstone, three-times champion Sir Jackie Stewart suggested the 29-year-old's head 'certainly seems to have gone a bit'. Just 24 hours later Hamilton, starting from sixth on the grid and with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg on pole, responded to his back-to-the-wall situation by claiming a crucial victory. Scroll down for video... Fightback: Lewis Hamilton won the British Grand Prix despite starting in sixth after a qualifying error . Home advantage: The British driver was able to feed off the energy of fans at Silverstone . Hamilton was aided by Rosberg's first retirement of the season due to a gearbox failure, but there was no denying his euphoria in his post- race celebrations and with the overall gap now just four points to the German. Far from Hamilton cracking, Wolff said: 'Different to what the perception is he is mentally very strong and he has coped well with problems. 'On Saturday night he showed a very mature, stable way of tackling things, and then in the briefing on the morning of the race he was very focused, very concentrated in a way that was really impressive. 'Another example is during the race he had a pit stop that wasn't perfect, but the first thing he did was to get on to the radio and say to the guys 'don't worry, let's make the next one better'. 'You can see within the team there is no blame culture, it's about trying to improve together. Mind games: Mercedes boss Toto Wolff, pictured with Niki Lauda (R), says Hamilton proved his mental strength . 'So he would have lifted himself out of his low anyway, but winning at home in front of such a crowd will have given him a big boost. 'When you are at home it does give you that extra boost, seeing the fans cheer. 'Even if you don't hear it in the car, I strongly believe in energy, and there was definitely energy behind Lewis at Silverstone.' Conversely, Wolff concedes the same could now happen for Rosberg as he heads into his home grand prix at Hockenheim next weekend. 'It could be the opposite in Germany and the energy could be behind Nico because it's home turf for him,' said Wolff. Bumber to bumper: Lewis Hamilton is only four points behind teammate Nico Rosberg in the title chase . With six one-twos scored by Hamilton and Rosberg this season, Wolff knows there would be no better place to chalk up number seven than on home soil for Mercedes, with their headquarters in Stuttgart just 80 miles away. 'We've already had a couple of home races,' said Wolff. 'We had Malaysia (home of title sponsor Petronas), then a bit of a home race in Austria (Wolff and non-executive chairman Niki Lauda were born there). 'Then we had our home race at Silverstone, and next is Hockenheim near Stuttgart where the mother company lives. 'That's the real home race, and it will be so important to score a good result, with a one-two what we will be trying to achieve.'

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Fernando Alonso has urged critics to give new Ferrari team principal Marco Mattiacci time to prove himself despite his lack of experience in Formula One. Alonso lost one of his closest allies in Stefano Domenicali this week as the Italian tendered his resignation on Monday in the wake of the team's poor start to the season, and with just one trophy to show for his six years in charge. In his place, president Luca Di Montezemolo has opted for 43-year-old Mattiaci, who up until this week was president and CEO of Ferrari North America. Presentation: Fernando Alonso, pictured with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen in Shanghai on Thursday, believes new Ferrari chief Marco Mattiacci must be given time to prove his credentials . Making his point: Alonso, sitting next to Lewis Hamilton, gestures at the drvers' press conference in China . Whilst possessing considerable management skills, Mattiacci lacks any knowledge regarding F1 and will quickly need to bring himself up to speed. 'We need to give him time, to see how he settles,' said Alonso, when asked about Mattiacci ahead of this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix. 'It's obviously too early to say whether he will be very good or very bad. 'We need to make sure he has the facilities ready, all the technical stuff, that all the team are behind him to ensure he settles as fast as possible, to put him in a place where he feels comfortable. 'And we're obviously hoping he will be successful because we need to be honest with our situation, it's not where we want to be, with a lot of room to improve. We need to be better in all areas.' Gone: Stefano Domenicali handed in his resignation at the beginning of the week . Plane sailing: Alonso arrives at Shanghai Airport with girlfriend Dasha Kapustina . As a good friend of Domenicali, Alonso is naturally sorry to see him go as he said: 'Stefano is a great man. 'We ski together on the first of January in the mountains in Italy, and we still have a close relationship. 'We've been talking all week long, which will continue because we've known each other for many years. 'As a team principal he made good choices, did good things. 'Unfortunately we missed opportunities in 2010 and 2012 (to win the title), and another in 2008 with Felipe (Massa), otherwise he could have had three championships in his pocket. 'But he brought in Pat Fry (engineering director), James Allison (technical director) and (Kimi) Raikkonen, and all the things people asked of him he gave to them. 'But results in sport are important, and the pressure at Ferrari is big, so he has made his decision, which we respect. 'It's not easy when you have a very privileged position in a Formula One team to be able to step back and say that maybe it's better to move. 'He did it for for Ferrari to improve, and in their best interests, and that is something we cannot forget, and we have to respect his decision. 'It's not as if in this race we will improve by a second because it is not as if Stefano was doing the front wing, the rear wing or whatever. 'So we need to wait, to see what we can improve, to help all the team to make us stronger and to regain some of the success from the past.'","Marco Mattiacci has replaced Stefano Domenicali as Ferrari team principal .

Real Madrid funded the signings of Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka and Karim Benzema by selling Wesley Sneijder and Arjen Robben, and last season Gonzalo Higuain and Mesut Ozil made way for Gareth Bale, so who goes where and for what price this summer after the £84million arrival of Kroos and Rodriguez?

WANTED BY: Arsenal, Chelsea . PRICE: £18million . Real Madrid put a 20m price tag on Sami Khedira at the start of the summer but with only one year left on his contract they might drop that closer to deadline day. Jose Mourinho is a big admirer of the 27-year-old and Arsene Wenger is also interested but whether either will pay £150,000-per-week for his services could be another matter entirely. He might have to drop his price too. On the move: Sami Khedira has not signed a new deal at Real Madrid and is set to leave . World Cup winner: The German has been linked with a move to Arsenal and Chelsea . VIDEO Wenger with unfinished transfer business . DIEGO LOPEZ / IKER CASILLAS . WANTED BY: Lopez: Monaco / Casillas: Arsenal, Liverpool . PRICE: £12/15million . When Keylor Navas signs (most probably next week) Real Madrid will have three top goalkeepers and even Carlo Ancelotti can’t come up with a plan that keeps all of them happy. Casillas’ form in the Champions League final and at the World Cup was down largely to a season on the bench for league games. He will not want a repeat of that. As things stand neither nor Lopez nor Casillas have pushed for a move but Monaco are pushing for Lopez and Casillas would leave for a Premier League adventure. On the way out? Diego Lopez is back in training but his stay at Madrid could be cut short by a transfer . Down and out: Madrid won't want Iker Casillas continuing his poor form from the World Cup at club level . ANGEL Di MARIA . WANTED BY: Monaco, Manchester United, Manchester City . PRICE: £40million . Monaco owner Dmitry Rybolovlev was at James Rodriguez’ presentation yesterday presumably not just to wave goodbye to one of his assets. The Russian will want to fill the void left by his star player and Di Maria fits the bill, he is even represented by Jorge Mendes who moved Rodriguez from Ligue One to La Liga. After his sensational season last year Monaco will not be the only club interested in a player who played wide in a 4-3-3 and in a 4-4-2 reaching the World Cup final and winning the European Cup final. Angel pursuit: Monaco and both Manchester clubs are keen to sign Angel Di Maria . Top form: Di Maria had an excellent season for Real Madrid last year, including helping to win 'la decima' ISCO . WANTED BY: Manchester City . PRICE: £30million . When Manuel Pellegrini’s Malaga took on Porto in the Champions League two seasons ago Rodriguez had a quiet match for Porto while Isco stole the show for Malaga. No-one did more for the midfielder’s career than the current Manchester City manager and he was very close to moving to the Etihad Stadium last summer but Madrid promised him the world and he changed his mind. This season Rodriguez will have to play ahead of Isco and it’s difficult to see how both might play together. There might be a different response if Pellegrini came calling again. Wanted man: Manchester City could bid for Real Madrid midfielder Isco this summer . Back in action: Isco (left) is back training with Real but he could find his opportunities limited next season .

It’s unlikely these three will move because they would then need to be replaced whereas the aforementioned would not. But Real Madrid’s revolving door transfer policy is often driven by demand. So if a big bid came in then it would be considered. Impressing: A series of good performances at the World Cup means Karim Benzema is not short of suitors .

The hero of the penalty shoot-out said: 'We left our fear at home - that is why we came through a group that had three former World Cup winners in it. We are not afraid of anyone.' Navas is now the World Cup’s most wanted keeper with tiny Spanish club Levante unable to keep hold of their star stopper whose contract runs out in one year and buy-out clause stands at just £6.5million. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Can Costa Rica's keeper save tennis balls served at 100mph? Wanted man: Atletico Madrid, Liverpool and Arsenal are all interested in Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas . What a save! The 'keeper made a stunning stop to thwart Theofanis Gekas's penalty against Greece . In the entire World Cup qualifying campaign he conceded just seven goals – only the United States let in fewer than Costa Rica. And having conceded just once in the group matches, against Uruguay, he made the save of the tournament against Greece in Recife to keep out Theofanis Gekas's penalty. Atletico Madrid are interested in Navas replacing Thibaut Courtois, who has gone back to Chelsea after three seasons on loan. But Arsenal, Liverpool and Everton are all monitoring the 27-year-old's situation. He finished last season as La Liga’s second-best goalkeeper based on goals conceded, and the best based on the number of saves made. It was Courtois who conceded fewest goals, but he had the best defence in Spain in front of him. At Levante, Navas had no such protection as was clear on the opening day of the season when he let in seven at the Nou Camp. 'I have had a tough journey to get where I am but I’ve fought hard and now I’m reaping the rewards,' Navas said, recalling how Spanish club Albacete plucked him from Costa Rica’s biggest side Saprissa in 2010.

He moved to first division Levante a year later and in the first two seasons he was understudy to Uruguayan Gustavo Gustavo Munua but last season became No 1 and the hard work put in under the tutelage of one of Spain’s most respected goalkeeping coaches, Luis Llopis, has reaped dividends. He arrived with the reputation for being a spectacular shot-stopper but Llopis believed he could become even quicker in his area. He is now four or five kilos lighter than when he arrived and Llopis says: 'Hours of training drills based on speeding-up his ability to accelerate, brake and change direction quickly in his area have paid off.' Asked by Marca if Costa Rica have agreed a bonus for actually winning the World Cup Navas said: 'Of course we have. We are just like any other team in the competition. We maybe have fewer options but we have a set of targets with economic rewards.'","Levante stopper was La Liga's best last season .

"By . Pete Jenson . Follow @@petejenson . Last August Gareth Bale was in Cardiff on international duty, dodging Spanish journalists on his way to meet up with his Wales team-mates, and still uncertain of his £86million transfer to Real Madrid. One year on, he will be back in Cardiff to play in the European Super Cup for Real against Sevilla and he will do so with 22 goals, the Spanish Cup and the Champions League. It’s hard to recall a record signing who has had a greater impact in his first year. Bale is only the third player in Real Madrid’s history to score in the final of both the European Cup and the Spanish Cup in the same season. Only Ferenc Puskas and Raul have done it before. Legend: Gareth Bale was instrumental in landing Real Madrid their much-wanted tenth European Cup . La Decima: The Bernabeu was full of supporters as the club paraded their newly won trophy through Madrid . Sept 1, 2013: Signs for Real Madrid for a world record £86million. Sept 14: Scores on debut in 2-2 draw against Villarreal. Oct 30: Scores two in 7-3 victory against Sevilla. Dubbed Cañonito — little cannon — by local media. Nov 30: A perfect hat-trick — header and goal with each foot — in 4-0 win over Real Valladolid. April 16, 2014: Brilliant solo effort in victory over Barcelona in Copa del Rey final is his 20th of the season. May 24: His goal sets up Real’s 10th European Cup triumph. No wonder Spanish sports daily Marca claimed: ‘He has turned out to be a bargain; he is already a Real Madrid legend’ and Diario AS added: ‘Bale’s was the winner; it was game over after that.’ Bale has already outdone all previous Brits abroad. Laurie Cunningham played in the 1981 European Cup final that Real Madrid lost to Liverpool and Steve McManaman was a goalscoring, man-of-the-match, winner in 2000 when Real Madrid beat Valencia 3-0. David Beckham managed just one Champions League quarter-final appearance in his four years at Real Madrid. Paul Lambert and Owen Hargreaves both won European Cups with foreign clubs and Kevin Keegan won European Footballer of the Year at Hamburg but never the European Cup with them. Bale has often also outshone the man he came to aid and abet last summer, Cristiano Ronaldo. He has delivered more than the Portuguese in the finals, although he was at pains to point out both halves of the dynamic duo have taken Real Madrid to glory this season. Big moment: This header earned Bale infamy in Real Madrid's long history . Inside the Estadio da Luz with his medal around his neck, before the players were whisked back to Lisbon airport for their 6am date at Madrid’s Cibeles fountain, he said: ‘We work well together and we enjoy playing alongside each other. Whoever scores we are all happy as long as we are winning.’ The 24-year-old’s favourite post-match phrase is ‘It’s a dream come true’ and when he was a teenage fan of the Spanish side he will have imagined such heroics as only a wide-eyed wannabe can. ‘The reason I joined Real Madrid was to play in these amazing matches. It’s hard to describe how I felt when the ball went in. It was an incredible feeling seeing all the fans behind that goal and all the players run towards me to celebrate.’ Upstaged: Bale outshone the best player in the world, Cristiano Ronaldo . Even Zinedine Zidane had joined in as the player he pushed the club to sign last summer delivered one of the most famous goals in their history. ‘When we got the equaliser it seemed that we had the momentum going into extra time. We looked fresher than them. They had a few players who had cramp and we showed what physical condition we were in,’ said Bale. Stories about Bale needing an operation this summer to cure a hernia were rubbished by his agent and there looked very little wrong as he leapt to head home after Thibaut Courtois had only managed to deflect a shot from Angel di Maria. Best ever: Bale has now proven himself as Britain's best ever footballing export . There had been tension earlier in the season, with the Argentine unhappy at being usurped by the new signing from Tottenham, especially as he was playing well. But problem solver Carlo Ancelotti made room for both and Bale’s team-mates have been completely won over by the shy boy from Cardiff, who will be going home this August having established himself as Britain’s best ever footballing export.","A year after his £86m transfer, it's hard to recall a signing who has had a greater impact in his debut season .

Chelsea's Andre Schurrle is now just one step from the World Cup final and says he is being supported every inch of the way by another Stamford Bridge German who didn’t quite make it to the biggest game in football. Michael Ballack was Germany captain in 2002 and he scored the winning goal in the semi-final against South Korea. But he also picked up a booking ruling him out of the final. Schurrle was a 12-year-old fan at the time. He went on to play for Bayer Leverkusen – alongside Ballack in 2011 – and then for Chelsea just like his hero, now he can outdo his idol by playing in the final next Sunday at the Maracana. Eyes on the prize: Andre Schurrle's Germany take on Brazil for a place in the World Cup final . Aspirations: Should Schurrle play in the final at the Maracana he'll have done something his hero and mentor Michael Ballack didn't . 'We have stayed in touch throughout the World Cup,' he said. 'He has sent me a messages before every game of the tournament and when I get back on the team bus there are usually messages too. We are in touch and the support helps me.' A revenge of sorts will be on the cards on Tuesday in Belo Horizonte when Germany face Brazil for only the second time in World Cup history. And with Miroslav Klose likely to step back down to the substitutes’ bench Schurrle could be in line for start. 'Now I am one step closer to achieving what Ballack managed to achieve in his career,' he says. 'I want to get to the final and win the tournament. That was our goal right from the beginning.' Germany’s chances are boosted by the absence of Brazil’s talisman and top scorer Neymar. In light of Neymar’s injury Schurrle’s Chelsea team-mates Oscar, Willian and Ramires could all now have an even bigger role to play. Schurrle said the Brazilian contingent in the Chelsea squad have spoken about nothing but the World Cup for the past few months, proud of hosting the tournament but also bearing the added pressure of a nation’s expectations. Big decision: Referee Urs Meier shows Ballack the yellow card that meant he missed the 2002 World Cup final . Support: The Chelsea and Germany legend has kept in touch with Schurrle before each World Cup match . 'They are well aware that whenever they go out on to the pitch there are millions of people watching them on television,' Schurrle said. 'They are handling it very well because it is not easy to play with this pressure. The Brazilians at Chelsea started to talk about the World Cup about two months before. 'They are proud to have the tournament in their country and we all saw what Brazil was like last year when they won the Confederations Cup and how it brought the whole nation together.' The expectations are with Brazil but the belief is increasingly with Germany, according to Schurrle. 'We have this feeling that we are close to going all the way,' he says. It’s now a long time since he came through at Mainz 05 with Ballack the player he most looked up to. Doing what his hero never managed to do would be a great way to head back to Chelsea for the new season for a campaign that will kick-off without another one of his role models, Frank Lampard. Proud: Chelsea and Brazil stars Oscar (left) and David Luiz (right), along with team-mates Willian and Ramires,  have been talking excitedly about the Cup being in their country, says Schurrle . On fire: Luiz celebrates scoring the remarkable free-kick which ultimately saw Brazil beat Costa Rica . 'It’s very sad for all the fans to lose someone who is a Chelsea legend but he had achieved everything at the club,' he says of the England midfielder who has played his last Chelsea game. 'Everybody loved him, I certainly loved playing alongside him. He was one of my idols when I was young and it was an honour to be his team-mate for one year.' There will be reinforcements and the £18million purchase from Bayer Leverkusen last summer has been buoyed by the acquisitions of Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa in this summer’s market. 'They are both very good players and everybody’s happy that we have signed them. But I am so focused on the World Cup I don’t think I will think about the new season until I am on holiday.' Hopefully for Chelsea’s German forward by the time he lies back on his lounger he will have played in a World Cup final and picked up the winner’s medal his hero Ballack was never able to get his hands on.

That is the verdict of Uruguay midfielder Cristian Rodriguez, who said: ‘He is the best player in the world. And I’m not saying that because I’m Uruguayan and so is he.’ Liverpool’s 31-goal star looks like making it back just in time to face Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka and Rodriguez drives home the importance of his recovery when he says: ‘As far as I’m concerned Leo Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are a notch or so below Suarez. He has demonstrated it for club and country. Messi and Ronaldo are not as good for their countries as for their clubs.’ Model: Uruguay midfielder Cristian Rodriquez shows off the new home kit for the World Cup . Suarez looks set to miss Uruguay’s first game of the Finals against Costa Rica in the hope that the extra days will see him start against England alongside Atletico Madrid’s Rodriguez. ‘Everyone loves “Luisito” in the squad,’ he says. ‘He is a rebel on the pitch who fights for every ball but that is what we love about him in Uruguay. We hate to lose at anything, we want to win — so his will to win makes him a good Uruguayan.’ For all the fight on the pitch Rodriguez paints a very different picture of his team-mate off it. ‘All the Atletico Madrid players were in the dressing room watching on television on the day of the draw and the text messages started flying. 'There is a group of us who send messages to one another and Luis is among that group, although he is one of the quieter ones who does not write that much; he tends not to get too excited about these things.’ Race against time: Luis Suarez is hoping to be fit in time for the England clash after his knee op .

Star attraction: Rodriguez says Suarez is better than Lionel Messi (left) and Cristiano Ronaldo (right) Rodriguez defends Suarez against the accusation that his quest to always finish on the  winning side means he crosses the line sometimes. ‘He lives for football and in  football if you are not alive then you are asleep and they take the ball off you — “adios”. You have to be smart on the pitch. It’s part of the game. You’ve got  the referee there; he’s there for  something isn’t he?’ Rodriguez agrees Uruguay and England are in the group of death but not just because of the presence of three world champions. ‘No one should underestimate Costa Rica because in a World Cup anything can happen,’ he says of his country’s first opponents. On form: Suarez scored 31 goals for Liverpool in the Premier League last season . Eye on the ball: Atletico's Rodriguez trained ahead of the Champions League final but did not play . ‘People say Costa Rica will be the easiest rivals but the temperatures will be high and they will be used to the climate and that could make them stronger.’ Does he believe a European team can win this summer’s tournament? ‘It’s not impossible for a European side to win in South America but it is a different climate and the pitches are very different — the surfaces are drier and that slows the game down; and it’s very humid. That is what will test the European teams. In Spain the pitches are kept wet and the ball runs faster so it is going to be very different for them. ‘There is also the added factor of travelling for European sides.

On the club’s pre-season tour of Scotland, with Henry the expensive new signing from Arsenal, Bojan was the star impressing so much that Barca had to turn down offers from Ajax to take him on loan. He stayed to fight for a place in the first team and became Barcelona’s youngest-ever goalscorer when he netted against Villarreal that October aged 17 years and 54 days and he was called up to the Spain squad, only to pull out because of sickness.

Lionel Messi could hack a wet, windy Tuesday night in Stoke captures football . fans' imaginations and we'll soon see whether Bojan can. In the April after Bojan became Barcelona's youngest-ever scorer, the La Liga giants drew Manchester United in the Champions League semi-final. Then-manager Frank Rijkaard was under pressure to pick the youngster instead of Henry - after all, the kid from the youth team had eight league goals to his name, one more than the Frenchman, having played fewer minutes. His strike against Schalke in the quarter-finals had opened the scoring in the first-leg and Henry himself admitted: 'You can understand it. He is having a fantastic season. He is a Catalan kid and the supporters love nothing more than to have a local hero.' Things got even better for the local hero in the following seasons. Pep Guardiola was promoted from the B-team to first-team coach and although at first that stunted Bojan’s development because the two had not always seen eye to eye the season before, eventually Guardiola was won over. When the 2009-10 season started Barcelona began the campaign with Ibrahimovic, Leo Messi and Henry in attack but it was Bojan who finished up as first choice with the disgruntled Zlatan left out of key end of season matches. The competition to stay in the team continued relentless however, and when Ibrahimovic left the following summer David Villa turned up. With Villa, Messi and the emerging Pedro, Guardiola found the front three that was to destroy Manchester United in the 2011 Champions League final at Wembley. You're the man: Henry (right) points at Bojan after the youngster scored in the Champions League quarter-final . No way through: Ibrahimovic was kept on the sidelines by an in-form Bojan in the 2009-2010 season . Bojan the boy wonder had become the forgotten man. And like so many schooled by Barca who then have to make their way beyond the confines of the Nou Camp, he found it tough. He had been at Barcelona since signing as an eight-year-old. His Serbian-born father, then a Barca scout, had played for Red Star Belgrade before moving to Catalonia where he met Bojan’s mother. His dad was the driving force in his son’s career as he scored more than 900 goals in various levels of the club’s youth system before becoming the third youngest first-team player in the club’s history in September 2007. It had been too much too young, perhaps. Even the Spain call-up had been brought forward because his dual-nationality made him eligible for Serbia. He had won the player of the tournament award two years running in the Under 17 European Championship, made his debut for the Under 21 side aged just 16, and became the second youngest player ever to represent his country when he finally made his debut in 2008 but the international career never got going and he faded from view at Barcelona. Loan spell: Bojan joined Ajax on loan for the year in 2013 and had been at Barca since signing as an eight-year-old . Bojan's move to Stoke will see him team up with former Barcelona defender Marc Muniesa, who signed at the start of July. Muniesa, who had been at the Nou Camp since starting his youth career in 2002 - three years after Bojan, was unable to tie down a regular place at Barcelona. 2009-2013: Barcelona B (79 apps, 4 gls) 2009-2013: Barcelona (2, 0) 2013-NOW: Stoke (0, 0) There was a lack of versatility in his game. As a youngster he had shone as a scampering centre-forward, always appearing at the right time with the perfect finish. But when Messi moved to a central position under Guardiola, Bojan would have to readjust to the demands of playing as a wide forward in Barça’s 4-3-3 and he never managed it. Now, after unsuccessful spells under current Barca manager Luis Enrique at Roma, and under another former Barcelona player Frank De Boer at Ajax, he finds himself under yet another one-time Barca player in Mark Hughes. The Premier League will be tough. He’s only 23 but this shot at the most competitive league in the world feels like a last chance to fulfil all that early promise. Former coach Rijkaard once said of him: ‘He is a special player who always makes the right decision on the pitch.’ He has taken a big decision off it this summer. Those at Barcelona who remember how he once upstaged one of the Premier League’s greatest ever performers, Henry, will hope it turns out well for him. Is he up to it?

"By . Press Association Reporter . Electrocuted: Hannah Defoe, 20, was killed in a freak swimming pool accident in St Lucia . A devastated mother wept today as she told how relatives battled to save her daughter who was electrocuted in a hotel swimming pool in St Lucia. Hannah Defoe, 20, the cousin of England footballer Jermain Defoe, was killed when she dived into the water while on holiday on the Caribbean island last summer. Her grieving mother today begged to hear the 'truth' about how her child died as she described the close-knit family’s agonising wait for answers. Hope Defoe, 50, clutched a picture of . her daughter as she told an inquest hearing relatives had been fobbed . off with 'excuses' from St Lucian authorities for more than a year. Mrs Defoe emailed an official in the island’s tourism department last night to plead for action. 'You were all so kind and gracious when we were in St Lucia, promising to help us,' she wrote. 'But we have been abandoned. 'Hannah died because she took a swim . in a hotel swimming pool. She was 20 years old and it was three weeks . before we were to celebrate her 21st birthday. 'We haven’t even been told if anybody has been charged.

'Look your daughter in the eye and then imagine her electrocuted and lying in a pool, at the bottom, for an hour and a half while you and others are suffering electric shocks as you try to rescue her. Tottenham striker Jermain Defoe was given permission to return home from the club's pre-season tour of the U.S. last year after news of his cousin's death . 'Now imagine nobody tells you how or why that happened but fobs you off with polite excuses.' Mrs Defoe cried softly as she added: 'Are you imagining that? Are you feeling the rage and desperation? 'Now try to get on with a normal life as it dawns on you that you may never be told the truth of what happened to your dead child who took a swim in a pool on holiday.' Hannah, a performing arts student from Enfield, North London, was on holiday as a reward for her hard work during her first year at the Performers College in Essex when she was killed. The inquest heard how the water in the pool registered 180 volts when tested the day after the incident. Reports at the time said Hannah's aunt Janet and cousin were taken to hospital after getting electric shocks as they tried to save her. Tottenham Hotspur striker Defoe was on the club’s pre-season tour of America when he was told the news of her death. He returned to the UK to be with his family.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It is hardly the most appetising of prospects, but it could just be the only viable way to satisfy the ever-increasing global demand for meat. A plan to feed animals with protein-rich maggots which have been reared on cow and pig excrement is currently being trialled by the EU. Soya beans which are normally used in feed for animals such as chickens, pigs and fish, are in great demand so scientists and farmers have been searching for a cheap and viable alternatives. Too much to stomach? A diagram explaining how maggots are being used in an EU trial to feed animals which then make it into the human food chain . Meat demand: An EU trial is underway to see if protein-rich maggots or larvae produced from flies bred on an industrial scale  could be used in animal feed . The EU plan would see flies bred on . an industrial scale using readily-available animal and vegetable waste, . with the maggots, or larvae, which they create then being used for feed. The . type of waste product used would vary depending on the location of the . 'fly farms' with sawdust and even used grain from the whisky distilling . process being touted as possibilities. With . the rising population and changes in dietary habits, the demand for . meat and dairy products is predicted to double by 2050, when there will . be an estimated three billion extra mouths to feed. Georg . Melzer, a partner at Eutema Technology in Austria, a company involved in . the project, told the Independent: 'What's used will depend on the area. 'In Scotland, if there are 10 whisky distilleries nearby it will use the grain fermented in the distillation process. Tucking in: Soya beans which are normally used in feed for animals such as chickens, pigs and fish, are in great demand so scientists are looking for cheap and viable substitutes . 'In Spain it might be pulp from a tomato field, while in a lot of places it will be a mixture of droppings, straw and sawdust you get on chicken farms.' The Grant Bait fishing-bait farm in Roos, East Yorkshire has been tasked with finding the best way to produce maggots on an industrial scale using waste materials. They will then be shipped to Ghent, in Belgium where the animal feed trials are being conducted. The project, which hopes to determine if the technique is feasible on a wide scale, is due to run for three years. However if it is deemed viable, it would require a change of EU law which currently prohibits the sale of meat from animals reared on feed containing maggots.","EU plan to use protein-rich fly maggots instead of soya beans in animal feed .

"By . Emine Sinmaz . She once wore a dress made out of strips of beef and has also angered critics with a pink-dyed fur stole. Now Lady Gaga has courted further controversy by wearing a bra with plastic assault-rifles for cups on stage. It comes only a month after gunman Adam Lanza shot dead 20 children and six teachers at Sandy Hook junior school in Connecticut. Singer Lady Gaga has worn a black bra with plastic assault rifles in each cup during her latest tour in North America . The 26-year-old singer has been seen in the outfit during the North American leg of her Born This Way Ball tour. She teamed the bizarre bra with military green trousers and platform boots at a concert in Vancouver, Canada, on Saturday. Lady Gaga is involved in a bitter feud with Sharon Osborne, who has criticised the singer for wearing fur and raw meat. Mrs Osborne said she was ‘sickened’ when she saw Lady Gaga’s infamous meat dress at the 2010 MTV Music Video Awards. ‘When I see you wearing fur, and using it as a fashion statement, the fact that defenceless animals have been killed so you can get your picture in the press is abhorrent to me,’ she said in a letter to the singer. ‘Shouldn’t you be teaching your “little monster” fans to respect animals and life?’ But Lady Gaga has defended her outfit choices, saying: ‘I am choosing not to comment on whether or not the furs I purchase are faux fur-pile or real. You see a carcass, I see a museum pièce de résistance.’ Her latest outfit, left, comes a month after the Sandy Hook massacre, while outfits including the meat dress, right, have previously caused a stir .

"By . Steve Robson . Jailed: Ellie Feghaly raped the woman after tricking her male companion into getting out of the cab to ask for directions . An unlicensed minicab driver who raped a female passenger after tricking her male companion to get out of the car and ask for directions has been jailed for nine years. Ellie Feghaly, 44, had picked up the 33-year-old victim and her friend in central London after they left a bar in Leicester Square in August last year. The pair thought he was a legitimate driver and got in to share the journey home. But on the way Feghaly became increasingly aggressive and clearly did not know where he was going. He then stopped at a Texaco garage in Shadwell, east London, and suggested the victim's male friend got out to ask for directions. As soon as he left Ferghaly drove off, locking all the doors and preventing her escape. He drove to a car park a short distance away where he raped her on the backseat. The victim eventually struggled free and alerted a passer-by to her ordeal. Her male friend, who had been frantically trying to call her on her mobile phone, then managed to find her. The woman reported the rape the next day and Feghaly was tracked down from his DNA profile. Three days later he was arrested and subsequently charged.
