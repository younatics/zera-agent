"(CNN) -- When I lived in Austin, Texas, every ""Lord of the Rings"" movie release was a cause for celebration among a certain group of friends. We saw new releases and DVD versions as soon as we could, a tradition that brought us great joy and hours of entertainment. Now, the first ""Hobbit"" movie is coming out this weekend, but I live in Atlanta. What's a geek to do? For this one, the answer is to fly back to Austin for 24 hours to see the movie with my friends at the legendary Alamo Drafthouse Cinema. Thanks to air miles, I'm doing it for about $15. My decision has earned funny looks and awkward conversational pauses, but I'm excited about my ""vacation concentrate"": no wasting time with filler, just 24 hours of fun. ""You'd be surprised how long a one- or two-day vacation feels if you really get away and go somewhere different,"" said Travelocity blogger Courtney Scott. ""I went to Milan on a long weekend (three full days) last winter because I found a fantastic flight deal, and I came back renewed and recharged!"" Events like movies or ballgames are often the impetus behind these quick trips. Mary DeVore of Seminole, Florida, traveled to Albany, New York, and Foxborough , Massachusetts, to see Bruce Springsteen in concert. She also took 24 hours to see the Eagles in Foxborough. ""The strange thing is that I am really not a concert junkie or anything,"" she said. ""I just feel that these guys and groups that I grew up listening to are aging and I want to be able to see them live when I can. Hoping the Rolling Stones go on one more tour -- you can bet I will fly somewhere for that!"" Anne Bresler of Novi, Michigan, and her husband took a one-day trip to New York last month to catch the superpopular Broadway show ""Book of Mormon."" ""We bought the tickets and figured we'd plan the full trip later,"" she said. ""When we got around to getting our flights, we realized that it would be easier to just go in and out in one day."" Not to mention cheaper: ""With hotel rooms at $300 to $400 for the holiday season, it was much cheaper to just do one day. We got to go to brunch at our favorite restaurant in the city, explored the Microsoft store in Times Square (my husband is a tech nerd) and then saw the show."" One-day trips aren't all fun and games, though. The smaller travel window means more risk of chaos or outright cancellation if there are any problems. Ashley Stanley of Melbourne, Florida, got 50-yard-line tickets to a New England Patriots game from her husband one year, but a massive winter storm nearly ended the celebration. Their plane was the only one to make it out of Atlanta, but they arrived too late for the car service to the game. Stanley says she and her husband made it for the second half ""by going the trains, planes and automobiles route and got yelled at by some oaf who had taken our seats for not being a 'real fan' for showing up late. After about eight hours of travel just to get to this game!"" Scott says flexibility is the key to a quick trip. ""For example, returning on a Sunday from a weekend getaway will typically cost you more than returning on a Monday or Tuesday."" Stanley offers advice that works for just about every traveler, no matter how long the trip: ""I just can't get stressed about it. If we make it, wonderful. If we don't, it's a story. The main thing for me is to persevere with humor, to be nice to everyone who's helping you and realize that it's often out of your control."" Have you taken a one-day trip worth sharing? What kind of event or situation would make you want to go somewhere for 24 hours? Let us know in the comments!","One fan is flying to Texas for one day to see ""The Hobbit"" with friends .

"(CNN) -- Everything looked perfectly normal as the plane prepared to land. I fastened my seat belt and looked through the window, watching the toy cars on the highway below gradually grow to life-size, and the airport runway rapidly -- too rapidly, perhaps -- move almost within arms' reach. The plane touched down, barreled ahead on the tarmac for a couple of seconds, and suddenly raised its nose and roared back up to the sky pressing us against our seat backs while climbing at a frighteningly steep angle. What happened, we wondered wordlessly. What's coming next? What came next was an anxious circling back to the airport followed by a smooth landing and not much of an explanation about what had gone wrong. By then, our heartbeats had mostly returned to normal. The story did not end the same way for passengers of Asiana flight 214, which crashed on landing in San Francisco last weekend, leaving two young women dead and scores injured. The Asiana disaster continues to rivet our attention. We want to know exactly what went wrong. But that's not only because it was a terrible tragedy for many families. It's that air flight commands so much interest. The San Francisco disaster is receiving much more attention, for example, than the horrifying runaway train crash in Canada that razed a town and killed at least 15 people, with another 45 still missing. We give far more attention to plane crashes that kill a small number of people than to, say, car fatalities, which killed more than 32,000 people in the U.S. alone last year. Each death is devastating and should be mourned, but our attention, in proportion to the risk and the death ""tool"" is much greater when it comes to flying. The experts have told us the statistics. Flying is almost perfectly safe. Even when disaster does occur, as with this weekend's flight, the numbers are extraordinary. More than 99.3% of the 307 people on board the Asiana flight survived. It's much more dangerous to do almost anything, the statistics tell us, than to fly. Billions of people fly every year and almost zero percent of them die in the process. The risk is comparable, we're told, to that of dying from a ceiling collapse at a grocery store. And yet, the reassuring statistics penetrate our collective fears as slowly as a worn drill bit cutting into stone. Flying remains a surreal, magical experience, but one that -- even among those who will adamantly deny it -- is framed by a twinge of irrational fear. The experience of climbing on an airplane and watching it defy gravity, break through the clouds and glide across the sky remains a barely comprehensible human achievement; it feels like a challenge against the laws of nature. Flying has a powerful emotional hold on us. There is something sublime about humans looking down upon the clouds. But the experience also packs the truth about our mortality more transparently than almost anything we do. When we are sitting in that cargo-packed aluminum tube, mocking the earth's pull, the thought that something could go badly wrong tends to sneak into our consciousness. A spell of strong turbulence can sharply shift the collective mood on board, no matter what the statistics. It's no wonder some people refuse to fly without a strong infusion of thought-quieting alcohol. It is that outsized emotional power of flight that makes plane crashes or news about near misses compel our attention, even when the casualties remain (fingers crossed!) so remarkably low. There is, of course, a grave downside to the exalted place on which we keep our fear of air disaster. There is a reason terrorists have so often used flights as the means to inflict terror. They know we pay attention, they know we are primed for fear. Not surprisingly, such a powerful primal response comes with a price tag. As a society, we spend enormous sums and we endure endless discomfort trying to do everything we can to make flying safe, or at least to make many of us feel as though we've made it safe. The 9/11 attackers, who used passenger aircrafts as weapons produced such a strong reaction that they drastically changed the flying experience and the cost of flying. Some put the total 9/11 tally at trillions, most of it from America's intense reaction to the hit. The Transportation Security Administration spends $8 billion per year shepherding us through endless security lines. We obediently stand in the queue, adding countless hours and enormous inconvenience, hoping it all amounts to more than security theatre. In the aftermath of my aborted landing, I spent hours trying to dig out the facts of what had occurred, as I have done after other, much scarier flying experiences involving engine failures, jammed landing gears and blown tires. Anyone who has traveled extensively, particularly in remote parts of the world, has a few stories to tell about airborne misadventures. First I asked a flight attendant what happened when I was leaving the plane. She said there was ""probably"" something blocking the runway on our first landing attempt. I looked up the public records of flight incidents and was surprised to find no sign of my obviously not routine incident. I called the airline and was told, much to my surprise, that these kinds of ""touch and go"" and ""go around"" incidents are quite routine, barely meriting a note in the log, and that there was probably another aircraft on the runway, perhaps an air traffic controller mistake. Then I called the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA said their logs showed no sign that such a thing had occurred. I called the airline again, pointing to the FAA's denial of their story. After much insistence and many phone calls and emails I was finally told it was the pilot who ""was not comfortable"" with the landing he was executing. Flying, it seems, will never be completely predictable or 100% incident free. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis once on flight that made aborted landing, then landed safely .

"Amman, Jordan (CNN) -- They're bringing down the American flags in Jordan and Israel and putting them back into storage after they got slammed in a sudden sandstorm during the last part of President Barack Obama's visit. Perhaps it was nature's way of keeping Obama from feeling he had gained the upper hand in this famously unpredictable region. Sandstorm or not, the president had reason to feel good about his trip. After deliberately lowering expectations about what he might achieve on the trip, Obama knocked it out of the park. He even managed to take the skeptics by surprise, helping broker the restoration of relations between Israel and Turkey. Bolstering friends, strengthening alliances and sending everyone in the Middle East a clear picture of America's vision and priorities for the region -- this was the common thread in everything the president did in Israel, the West Bank and Jordan. He made a persuasive case that the U.S.-Israel alliance is, in his words, ""eternal, it is forever."" He spoke passionately and effectively in favor of Palestinian statehood and the need to restart the peace process. He made it clear the United States will not tolerate a nuclear Iran but prefers to prevent it through diplomacy. He reiterated his call for an end to the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria and showed his strong support for Jordan's King Abdullah, a moderate king who says he is trying to democratize his country without the need for bloodshed. As Obama returns to Washington, not everyone is happy about what they heard. But if power is the ability to influence the behavior of others and the course of events, then he managed to make America a bit more powerful after a mere three days in this turbulent region. In a visit filled with poignancy, symbolism and, yes, substance, one of the most dramatic and unexpected moments came minutes before Air Force One departed Israel for Jordan. As the milky white sky gave signs of trying to clear, Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stepped inside a trailer on the tarmac and made a historic call to Turkey's prime minister. When the call was over, Israel and Turkey had restored diplomatic relations. After an acrimonious three-year dispute over a botched and lethal 2010 Israeli raid on a Turkish-flagged flotilla trying to break the Gaza blockade, Netanyahu apologized. The reconciliation was not all Obama's doing, but he gave the final push that allowed two pivotal Washington allies to work out their differences at a time when events in Syria and Iran demand the United States and its friends work closely together. Opinion: Obama goes over Netanyahu's head to the Israeli people . A major objective of the trip was to convince Israel and its enemies that the United States is committed to Israel's survival. The goal is fundamental to regional stability, because as long as anyone has any doubts, those who advocate destroying Israel will continue pursuing the objective and gaining followers while making Israelis more hesitant to take risks for peace. From the moment he landed, Obama alluded to 3,000 years of Jewish history on the land. He told Israelis -- in Hebrew, lest they miss it -- ""Atem lo levad,"" ""You are not alone."" He talked about Israeli tourists recently murdered in Bulgaria, about threats from Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran, about chemical weapons from Syria. And then he made an impassioned call for Israelis to take the perspective of Palestinians, for the sake not only of their own security but also of justice. Israelis cheered. It was a masterly performance. By spending time in the West Bank, Obama raised the profile of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas relative to that of his rival Hamas. And when he declared that those who seek Israel's destruction ""might as well reject the earth beneath them and the sky above,"" his words threw a punch against Hamas and Hezbollah, whose stated objective he was labeling a hopeless cause. When he arrived in Jordan, America's most reliable Arab ally, he widened the lens to the growing crisis in Syria, which is spilling over, sending more than 400,000 refugees to a country practically devoid of natural resources. He pledged an additional $200 million to King Abdullah for the sustenance of the refugees still fleeing Syria by the thousands every day. Opinion: The empathy president . Standing with the Jordanian king, with the knowledge that Israel and Turkey had healed their rift, Obama projected an air of confidence and achievement, even if events in Syria seem to spin out of control; even as King Abdullah warned the West has become naive about the agenda of the Muslim Brotherhood, the biggest winner so far in the so-called Arab Spring. This was Obama's first visit to an Arab country since 2009. Back then, Egypt was America's strongest Arab friend. Today, the Middle East is undergoing a violent and unpredictable transformation. During barely 72 hours in the region, Obama reasserted a measure of influence. He laid out America's vision and gave a vote of confidence to America's friends. It was a subdued but visible show of U.S. influence and power in a time and a place of unexpected sandstorms and ferocious revolutions, where no man, no nation, has full control over the course of history. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: In Middle East trip, Obama, gave support, firmed up alliances, showed U.S. vision .
She says a surprise was his helping broker key Netanyahu apology to Turkish prime minister .

"Amman, Jordan (CNN) -- Forget your preconceptions. Erase your stereotypes -- or at least set them aside for a moment. The Middle East, this ancient land battered by powerful forces and mystical passions, is full of surprises. I have traveled in and out of various countries in the Middle East over the course of decades. All too often and in too many places, aspects of life made it seem as if the clock became stuck in a different time. No longer. Here are five signs the Middle East is changing in ways you may not have expected: . 1. Instead of politics and religion, try tango and salsa: It's true; politics and religion remain at the core of much that goes on here. And it is also true that Jordan has stood near the front of Arab modernity in many respects. Still, you might be surprised to find that for many, the passion for tango and salsa weigh more than ideology and sectarianism. After the sun sets over Amman, Jordan's capital, local nightclubs become thick with smoke and crowded with hip, fashionable, often apolitical young Arabs. Harout Kiprian, 32, an Iraqi exile, is one of a large group that has become a fixture of the Amman nightlife. These clubbers greet each other with kisses on each cheek and take to the floor as skillfully as any of their counterparts in Latin America. They twirl and swing their partners to the rhythm of the music and to romantic Spanish lyrics that are probably as mysterious to them as Arabic to the songs' Latin American composers. There is tango night at the Landmark, overlooking Amman's glinting skyline, and nightly salsa at Trader Vic's, with a live band on contract directly from Cuba. Kiprian, who casually calls himself a ""Salsero,"" says he has no interest in politics and goes out dancing ""minimum twice a week."" His friends say it's much more often. The nightclub scene, with loud music, swaying hips and lively interaction between men and women, is ostensibly apolitical, but no one would mistake it for anything but a sign of a yearning for a modern, worldly, even secular Middle East. 2. Humor has become a powerful weapon, and it is terrifying the pious and the mighty. Since the start of the Arab uprisings, the Muslim Brotherhood has won almost every major election in the region while progressive liberals have looked incapable of mounting a credible campaign. Now, however, modernizers have discovered a new tactic: If you can't beat them, laugh at them. Satirists and comedians, with immense reach because of the Internet, are making fun of Islamist politicians, particularly in Egypt, sometimes just by quoting their own words and replaying their fiery sermons before amused young audiences. The government is clearly nervous and scrambling for a response, accusing comedians of denigrating Islam and insulting the president. But it's hard to defeat someone who is laughing at you, pointing out your hypocrisy. Authorities are going after comedians, in the case of Egypt, dancing around its stated respect for free expression. And comedians are becoming more popular with every arrest warrant. Bassem Youssef, arrested and released on bail a few days ago, is known to many as the Egyptian Jon Stewart. He has more than 1.2 million Twitter followers and is famous across the region. His television show has tens of millions of viewers, and his videos are watched on YouTube by millions more, who laugh at the powerful, the pretentious and the holier-than-thou. His humor goes after everyone, including liberals. But his biggest success has been in wiping away the aura of sanctity, the claim of divine wisdom that had enveloped religious authorities. When his ""sin meter"" explodes, measuring a government attempt to justify economic policies on religious grounds, when he hugs and caresses a pillow with a picture of President Mohamed Morsy, he undermines Islamists more effectively than any liberal ideologue. That's why prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for him (he's out on bail). It's why satirists have been imprisoned in Iran. It's why the ultra-religious have prevented comics from performing in Tunisia. It's why one recent satirical piece on a Middle East politics and culture site declares that Egypt has decided to eradicate humor. 3. When an American president shows up, it's not that big a deal. President Barack Obama came to Amman, and most people paid little attention. There were no throngs in the streets as the motorcade zoomed across town. People in rooftop restaurants gazed out curiously, but no one would accuse the American president of bringing life to a standstill in this city. The United States is no longer seen here with the awe -- negative or positive -- that it once inspired. Conspiracy theorists accuse Washington of installing the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt or of starting the war in Syria. Others complain that it's not doing enough to stop the Syrian slaughter, and many accuse it of being too friendly with Israel. But to anyone who has visited the Arab world over the years, it is clear the obsessive thinking about America is, at the moment, a thing of the past. 4. Fewer people buy the theory that it's all about Israel. When it comes to Israel, there is widespread and intense animosity. And yet in conversations with people here, and even in the views expressed by an Arab columnist, the old theory that all the Middle East's problems originate with the Jewish state has little currency. It was an old tactic of the dictators: to blame it all on Israel while fanning the flames of resentment. But two years after Tahrir Square -- after the toppling of tyrants, amid raging civil wars and worsening economic crises -- people largely dismiss the idea that establishing a state for Palestinians, while desirable, or even removing Israel altogether, would repair the region's economies, improve the status of women and religious minorities, or end fighting between Shiites and Sunnis. When Islamist parties called for a Million Man March against Israel in Amman, about 300 people showed up. 5. Even kings say they want democracy: The Arab Spring did not flower quite as fragrantly as people had hoped, and that has reduced the pressure for change in places such as Jordan. But demands for reform continue. Among those calling for more democracy, of all people, are nonelected rulers, such as Jordan's King Abdullah II. Not everyone believes his pledges to democratize, but at least on the surface, the opposition and the king agree that Jordan should move toward a constitutional monarchy. Morocco's king has ushered in some reform, as have, to a lesser extent, other Arab monarchs. The Middle East is not the same. Protests have become routine. Change is in the air, but the stereotypes and preconceptions don't do it justice -- just ask the salseros in Amman's nightclubs. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: The Middle East shows signs of change new to a frequent visitor to the region .
She says Amman, Jordan, club scene with tango, salsa shows yen for modern, secular world .

"(CNN) -- Here in Boston, people will grieve for many days. How could anyone be so evil as to plant a bomb that would murder an 8-year-old child, rip the legs off parents and devastate a celebration of athletics that is pure joy. These were murders that wrench the soul. But if these cowards thought they would scare this city -- that their acts of terror would actually terrorize -- they picked the wrong place. Boston, as President Barack Obama so rightly said Monday night, is a ""tough and resilient town"" -- always has been and always will be. It will heal but will not forget; it will care for the wounded but will make the murderers pay their price. Boston has a reputation as an intellectual town, and it is that. Two of the world's best universities are here, along with a dozen other fine colleges and universities. It is electric with creativity and innovation. As they showed again after the bombing, its doctors and hospitals are world-class. Citizens can find a great concert or art gallery anytime they want. No wonder that in contrast to most other aging cities, young and old are streaming here to live these days. But that doesn't mean Boston is soft. Just the opposite. Boston has plenty of fight, too -- just ask any team that has banged up against the Patriots, Red Sox, Celtics or Bruins. Since 2004, don't forget, Boston has won championships in all four major sports. That doesn't happen to softies. Rothkopf: In the face of terror, keep calm . The graveyards here are full of glorious men and women -- brave souls who carved the first communities out of wilderness, stood up first against British oppression, stood up first against the abomination of slavery, stood up early for the rights of women, and in recent years has stood up early and often for the rights of gays and lesbians. Harvard has lots of Nobel laureates, but it is also proud that it has the largest number of Medal of Honor winners of any university, save the military academies. Traditionally, the marathon itself occurs on Patriots' Day in Massachusetts -- a moment when people take time off to remember Lexington and Concord. One can watch re-enactments of the British marching to rid themselves of rebels -- and men without uniform but deadeyes with a rifle picking them off from the woods. If you want to remember the grit of the early men and women of Massachusetts, pull down your copies of David McCullough's histories. Reread ""1776"" and its fabulous stories of Bunker Hill and lifting the British siege of Boston (when men pulled cannons all the way across Massachusetts to chase away the most powerful navy in the world). Or reread ""John Adams,"" the book that was originally intended to be about Adams and Jefferson -- until McCullough fell out of love with Jefferson and into love with Abigail. One of my favorite episodes in the Adams book occurs when her husband insists on taking their teenage son, John Quincy, on a perilous voyage to England. Abigail writes a farewell letter to John Quincy that captures the New England spirit: . ""It is not in the still calm of life, or the repose of a pacific station, that great characters are formed. The habits of a vigorous mind are formed in contending with difficulties. Great necessities call out great virtues ... qualities which would otherwise lay dormant wake into life and form the character of the hero and the statesman."" In most of the country, that spirit is called toughness; in New England, it is often called hardiness. And with the passage of time, it has not disappeared. LZ: It can happen anywhere . Monday's bombings cap a 50-year period for Boston that has been marked by violence, tragedy and grief. It started with the assassination of a favorite son, John F. Kennedy, in 1963, and continued with the assassination of his brother Robert, later the plane crash of young John Jr. and the loss of another brother, Ted. So much sadness across these years. Yet there has been more. Massachusetts lost 1,537 in Vietnam, 12 in the first Gulf War, and 118 so far in Iraq and Afghanistan. On 9/11, two of those planes flew from Boston's Logan International Airport. Violence has also stalked the streets of Boston, but as they have done so often, people here stood up against the tide. In the late 1980s, gang violence and murder were rampant; by 1990, Boston felt like Chicago today as it had the highest number of killings in its history, many among the young. Opinion: Our 'greatest day' turns to horror . But even if it is occasionally knocked down, as it was by these bombings, the real Boston story is how it always gets up again. That spree in the '80s and early '90s of kids killing kids, even at funerals, so shocked the city that leaders of all stripes -- political, religious, business, nonprofit -- initiated a comprehensive, community-based strategy to reach at-risk youth early, and over five years, the rate of youth homicides dropped 80%. There was an upward spike in the mid 2000s, but the numbers are now again falling steadily. War, violence, tragedy -- Boston won't surrender to darker forces. Monday's bombings shattered any feeling of safety. People here looked with horror into the abyss. But count on it: Boston is still alive with the spirit of Abigail Adams. Great necessities will call out great virtues, and qualities that may seem dormant will wake into life, forming the character of new heroes and new leaders. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen.","David Gergen: Bostonians will grieve, but terrorists picked the wrong city to try to frighten .

"(CNN) -- You cannot mess with America. The moment the Boston Marathon came under attack, the country pulled together and rallied. The FBI vowed to pursue the bombers ""to the ends of the earth."" They meant it, and everyone knew it. If you launch a terrorist attack on U.S. soil, America's vast resources will spring into action and the country will spare no effort to catch you. Within three days of the marathon blasts investigators had identified the suspects and released their pictures to the public. By the end of the week, one of the suspects was dead, the other in custody. Bostonians poured into the streets in joyous celebration. But how strong, really, is America? Americans are dying by the thousands at the hands of other Americans and the country can't figure out what to do about it. Many at home and abroad scratched their heads when in the midst of the bombing investigation, with all hands on deck to crack the case, the U.S. Senate could not manage to approve a minuscule improvement to the country's efforts to keep weapons out of the hands of potential criminals, including possible terrorists even though polls show most of the public support it. How strong, really, is America? No other nation has even a small portion of America's military power or a fraction of its reach. The country's enemies know they have nowhere to hide. America's unmanned drones will find you and kill you in the most remote corners of the earth. Americans are patriotic and resilient. The population responded with determination, kindness and courage after the Boston bombing. Police, military and intelligence personnel are skilled and brave. They have kept terrorist attacks to a minimum in the years since 9/11. And when terrorists attack, or try to, investigators solve the case with a quickness and ingenuity that rivals fictional television detectives, even as we're constantly warned it is unrealistic to expect such dramatic results. America's might is something to behold. Except when it isn't. More than 30,000 people in the United States are killed every year by someone brandishing a gun. It is a staggering number, no matter what you believe about the right to bear arms. A problem that causes so many people to die every year is one that requires urgent attention. And yet America simply cannot find a way to stop it. How strong is that? It is as if a house stood protected as a fortress, with a high fence around it, with guard towers and alarm systems to keep intruders out, while inside the residents were slaughtering one another. When you travel abroad, people ask what it is about Americans and their guns. As much as we hear from hunters, the issue goes much deeper than that. From the founding days of the nation, freedom lay at its core, and freedom has been viewed as protection from an overreaching government. The Second Amendment to the Constitution, adopted in 1791, states that the people have a right to ""bear arms,"" but it also prefaces it with what sounds like a caveat, that this is because ""a well regulated militia"" is ""necessary to the security of a free state."" Still, Americans have had a romantic relationship with their arms. Think back to the cowboys and their six-shooters and Colt rifles. The romance and the freedom, it's all part of America's character and history. Americans will never look at guns the way, say, the Dutch look at them. In some respects, that is part of America's strength. The people feel a very personal stake, a direct responsibility for the country's freedom. And yet, not even the most ardent gun lovers would argue that it is acceptable for young men filled with hatred, dangerously disturbed or with a track record of violence, to have free access to weapons. The greatest defenders of freedom agree that the massacre of children in school or of moviegoers in a theater constitute a grave affront to the security of the country. It has become a crisis that demands a response. If America were really strong, it would find a way to stop the killings, to staunch the bleeding. But no, America has become weak. The nation has become incapable of solving problems through normal legislative channels. How strong is that? The country's political system has fallen into a muddy, sticky, foul-smelling quagmire. Problems whose gravity is enough to produce near consensus among the population cannot seem to find a solution in Congress. If it's a pure security issue, authorities can order everyone to stay at home in Boston for an entire day. They can ask everyone to send in their iPhone pictures of the marathon to try to solve the case together. If the problem is national debt, however, the mighty nation produces a travesty like the ""sequester,"" creating hundreds of flight delays for no reason at all other than the incompetence of its politicians. Or if the problem is regulatory oversight, how strong is a country where parts of a town are destroyed by the explosion of a fertilizer plant that had not had an inspection in more than two decades? America is in possession of more power than any country on Earth. And yet, its people are not secure. They are dying in large numbers from problems that a better functioning government could do much to prevent. To make America truly strong and its people safe, fixing this broken system deserves at least as much urgent attention as catching the perpetrators of terrorist attacks. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Boston Marathon aftermath shows vast resources, reach of America .

"(CNN) -- A few hours before he announced the death of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, Vice President Nicolas Maduro repeated the claim that Chavez's fatal illness was caused by outsiders, and he labeled the opposition the ""enemy of the nation."" With that, he gave voice to one of the principal legacies of the Chavez era, one of divisiveness and scapegoating. The Chavez legacy, however, includes much more than animosity between rich and poor, between left and right. Chavez played a pivotal role in bringing the plight of Latin America's impoverished people to the top of the political agenda. It was as if the former paratrooper grabbed a continent by the lapels and shouted ""You must fight against poverty!"" And the continent listened. Even the people who vehemently disagreed with Chavez's neosocialist, populist ideology realized that economic inequality required urgent attention. In the years after he came to power, aggressive anti-poverty programs have been launched in a number of Latin American countries, with impressive success. Chavez improved the lot of the poor in Venezuela, and he had an impact on the reduction of inequality elsewhere in the region. But in the process, he deeply undermined Venezuelan democracy, and he created a model of authoritarianism that other autocrats copied, harming democracy in many countries. His anti-American, anti-opposition policies gained credence at home when the opposition staged a coup attempt in 2002 that Chavez said was supported by the U.S. His histrionic pretense that he could ""smell sulfur"" when he took the podium after ""the devil"" George Bush at the United Nations, turned him into a global media superstar, and a prominent player in an anti-Washington alliance with Iran's regime. He provided a lifeline to the Castro regime in Cuba, and ostentatiously made friends with America's foes, such as Libya's Moammar Gadhafi and Syria's Bashar al-Assad. The social programs he developed brought housing and health care, and they helped feed the poor. He helped raise living standards and inspired millions of passionate supporters. The intensity of support was regularly stoked by the constant attacks against the rich, ""the oligarchs,"" as he called them, and the United States, or ""the empire."" But the unorthodox economic methods of his ""21st century socialism"" and his ""Bolivarian"" revolution, distorted the economy and, in fact, created less economic growth and less prosperity than other countries in Latin America. And a strong case has been made that Venezuela, a country with enormous oil wealth, should have grown far more than it did during the Chavez years, when businesses were regularly confiscated by the government and the vital oil industry was put in the hands of political supporters instead of technical experts. The economic legacy is one of sky-high inflation, chronic shortages and dried up investment. Venezuela's economy has grown, but more slowly than that of Peru, Brazil or Panama, probably more slowly than it might have. On the political front, Chavez empowered the poor, making them rightly feel that they mattered in system that had been controlled by the rich. But before long, he manipulated the system to a degree that democracy started thinning to little more than a brittle veneer. Chavez unsuccessfully tried to take power through a coup attempt in 1992. In 1999, he won the presidency at the ballot box. He kept the top job until the day he died. Immediately after taking office, he convened a constitutional assembly. The new constitution mandated a maximum of two terms in office. He called elections again and won a second time, counting that as the start of his two terms. After winning the presidency for a third time in 2006, he called a referendum abolishing the presidential term limit and said he might remain president until 2030. He won for a fourth time last year. Had mortality not interfered, Chavez could have become the eternal president. That manipulation of the electoral system has been one of the most pernicious legacies of Chavismo. In Nicaragua, for example, President Daniel Ortega, facing a constitutionally mandated end to his presidency, took a page from the Chavez playbook, packing the Supreme Court, which ruled that term limits do not apply to the president. Other Latin American presidents have imitated Chavez populist undemocratic style, intimidating opponents, restricting the media and subverting the judiciary. Human Rights Watch documented the steady erosion of democratic freedoms over the 14 years of Chavez's tenure, concluding that Chavez and his supporters built ""a system in which the government has free rein to threaten and punish Venezuelans who interfere with their political agenda, creating ever greater risks for judges, journalists and human rights activists."" Chavez and his backers took over practically all the levers of power, all the while claiming democratic legitimacy. They allowed the opposition to continue functioning, which along with the U.S. provided them with a foil to blame for the country's woes. The judiciary, in particular, became a tool of the government, used for political purposes even as the crime rates spiraled, homicide rates reached unprecedented levels and most crimes went unsolved. The government decided to stop keeping crime statistics, but one private organization counted more than 118,000 homicides since Chavez took office. Experts said one of the problems was the justice system, which, like other parts of government, had become more political than professional. In one infamous case, Judge Maria Lourdes Afiuni granted bail to a banker charged with breaking currency controls while he awaited trial. In his weekly television show, Chavez declared ""The judge has to pay!"" She spent three years in a jail where, she said, she was raped, awaiting trial on trumped-up corruption charges. Chavez shut down critical media outlets and threatened others with closure, refusing to renew broadcast licenses of some of his most powerful critics. In recent years, the appeal of Chavismo started waning in Latin America. Other less divisive, more democratic, and more effective approaches became more popular. With Chavez off the stage in Venezuela, a number of questions hang in the air. The acrimony of his rule has left a dangerously divided Venezuela facing serious social and economic challenges, with the latest accusations by Maduro adding fuel to those hot embers. Chavez leaves behind a country where the poor have been empowered and society has been divided, and a continent where alternatives to his model look more appealing than ever.

"(CNN) -- The death toll grew to 38 on Tuesday as crews recovered three more bodies in last week's devastating train derailment in the Canadian town of Lac-Megantic, said Genevieve Guilbault, spokeswoman for the Quebec coroner's office.

"(CNN) -- As the New Year approached, millions anxiously followed the news from two very different parts of the world about two very different women -- women whose lives somehow touched us, whose fate seemed, somehow, linked to all of us. The world held its breath when word came that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was hospitalized in New York. The news arrived at a time when we were trying to absorb, with profound sadness, a seemingly unrelated drama unfolding thousands of miles away. In New Delhi, a 23-year-old woman, a university student on her way home after watching a movie with her boyfriend, was brutally raped and beaten by a group of men. She later died from her injuries. The parallel stories point to a sharp divide in the worldwide struggle for women's equality. While women have made major strides, in some cases reaching the pinnacle of power, the most fundamental human rights -- such as freedom to go outside without risking harassment and physical attack -- elude millions, and full equality remains an unreached goal for most. iReport: 'She could have been me' Clinton, one of the world's most powerful women and an icon of the global fight for women's equality, has returned home and doctors say they expect a full recovery. In India, the plight of an anonymous woman nicknamed ""Nirbhaya,"" Sanskrit for dauntless, has become a turning point for the country. (That we don't use Nirbhaya's real name proves the grotesque reality that being raped remains a source of shame for the victim.) Nirbhaya's ashes have been scattered, and it seems her death was not in vain. The attack sent tens of thousands of people -- men and women -- into New Delhi's streets and pulled the thick cover from India's unspeakable rape statistics. Most rapes go unreported for good reason. Of the more than 600 cases filed with the Delhi police last year, only one resulted in conviction. Powerless rape victims often resort to suicide. News: Clinton's future 'as good as her past,' docs say . The contrast could not be sharper with the woman many call simply Hillary. Speculation about whether she will run for president in 2016 is unending. The day she was hospitalized with a blood clot, we heard that she again came in first in Gallup's Most Admired Woman poll, finishing at the top for 11 years in a row and a total of 17 times since 1993, more than anyone in Gallup's history. She is probably the world's best-known woman and unquestionably one of the most influential. But she is only one of many who have reached so far. Women lead some of the globe's biggest, most important countries. Chancellor Angela Merkel heads the government of Germany, Julia Gillard leads Australia, Dilma Rousseff is president of Brazil, and the list goes on. American voters just elected 20 women to the Senate, the largest number in history. And yet, that's just 20% of the seats. It's sad we find this an accomplishment worth celebrating. The push for equality has unleashed push-back. Rape, we are told, is about power. In traditional societies, men see improvements in the status of women as a challenge to their own. Sexual assaults by gangs of self-congratulating, hyperventilating men, whether in New Delhi, in Cairo's Tahrir Square or somewhere in Somalia, amount to chest-pounding assertions of dominance from fearful, cowardly individuals. In countries with strong laws and changing attitudes about women, the number of rapes has been plummeting. Opinion: End global rape culture . Then there are the murders and attempted murders. Last year we saw Pakistan's Taliban try to kill Malala Yousafzai, the 14-year-old girl who demanded nothing more than the right to an education. And last month, in neighboring Afghanistan, gunmen murdered Najia Sediqi, the provincial director of women's affairs. Between the two extremes in women's status, we have a much less dramatic -- but still crucial -- struggle. The women of Egypt, who stood on the front lines of the revolution, will now have to live with a new constitution that commits the state to ""preserve the genuine character of the Egyptian family"" and vaguely notes the ""duties of a woman toward her family,"" opening the door to who-knows-what efforts by the state to keep women in their place. In the United States, where progress is indisputable in so many areas, women still make, in the aggregate, 76 cents for every dollar men earn. Inequality is pervasive in areas that are subtly important. Despite having a female secretary of State, and even, possibly, a female secretary of Defense on the horizon, Washington remains a ""city of men,"" as the writer Micah Zenko noted, with women woefully underrepresented in the corridors of power, in think tanks and in academia. Women's minds and ideas don't receive an equal hearing on the national stage partly because, as one survey showed, only 20% of all op-eds are written by women, and just 15% of columns dealing with foreign policy and security issues. Opinion: House GOP failed women on Violence Against Women Act . Every women walks on the path laid painstakingly and deliberately by people like Hillary Clinton, or accidentally, tragically, by women like Nirbhaya. The road to women's equality, it turns out, is paved with potholes, quicksand and death traps. There is a reason so many feel a close connection to Hillary Clinton and to Nirbhaya. Their stories, like those of 3 billion others, are of women seeking to make it in what is still today mostly a man's world. As Clinton recovers and as the people of India work to build a positive legacy from Nirbhaya's death, the obvious lesson is that much work remains ahead. Strong headwinds will push against women's progress, but progress can be achieved through urgent legislation, through patient education, and when necessary -- as it is now -- through mass protests and unrelentingly firm demands. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Hillary Clinton illness and New Delhi rape tell different stories about state of women .

"(CNN) -- Americans love a hero. Everybody does. So who could resist the touching story of the New York policeman who, seeing a homeless man sitting barefoot in the cold, walked into a shoe store and bought him a new pair of all-weather boots? The picture of clean-cut Officer Larry DePrimo kneeling before bearded, straggly Jeffrey Hillman became an Internet sensation. More than 1.6 million people saw it in the first 24 hours after the New York Police Department posted the image, which was snapped by a tourist. Chapter 1 of this story moved millions to shed a tear, and one hopes it inspired countless acts of kindness. Now, we have Chapter 2. And it should move us even more. Hillman, who became much less famous than his benefactor, is barefoot once again. And the story, as it turns out, is much more complicated than we ever thought. New York City officials say Hillman has had an apartment but, for some reason, returns to the streets. Despite veterans benefits, federal Section 8 assistance and Social Security, he sits on the cold New York pavement and, barefoot, walks its streets. Clearly, this is a sad situation that will not be resolved with the purchase of a new pair of shoes. Indeed, while DePrimo deservedly received accolades and media attention, we heard almost nothing about the homeless man; there was never any reason to believe his fortunes had improved. After providing protection for his blistered feet, society simply moved on, happy to pat itself on the back for a job well done -- and just in time for Christmas. Photos: Haunting portraits of the homeless . New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly gave DePrimo a pair of cuff links. As for Hillman, Kelly flippantly explained, ""We're not looking for him. He has shoes now. He's much more difficult to spot."" Hillman, 54, has told reporters that he hid the shoes because ""they are worth a lot of money."" The explanation is not important. Hillman's family told a reporter that ""Jeffrey has his life, and he has chosen that life."" But can the country turn its back on one of its own, a homeless military veteran, and say ""it's his choice""? Remember the homeless man with the velvet voice, Ted Williams? He, too, was rescued by a miracle. But he needed help, substance abuse treatment, before he could keep a job: before he could keep on his all-weather boots. What matters is that Hillman, like thousands of others, in the street, in a country that, despite all its economic challenges, remains the richest nation the world has seen. What matters is that a heartwarming act of kindness -- a man opening his wallet to buy another man shoes -- is not enough to keep him from going barefoot. Some problems are too big for individuals to tackle alone. Some problems, such as homelessness, require complex solutions. Some problems remind society that when it came together and organized, it created government. The reminder is particularly timely now as the country's leaders negotiate over the ""fiscal cliff."" The talks are a political contest. But they are also about the soul of the nation. America's leaders are discussing the country's guiding philosophy. Sadly for the Jeff Hillmans of America, the weakest of the weak, America seems to have decided it has less money to help its neediest. Other nations are undergoing similar debates about their own identity and values. America is not the only country with a homelessness problem, and charges that the United States is callous and indifferent to the poor, which I have often heard abroad, are simply false. The U.K.-based Charities Aid Foundation, says Americans are the most generous people on earth. Last year, 65% gave money, 43% gave time, 73% helped a stranger. Despite the economic slump, three-quarters of the giving, $217 billion, came from individuals. Corporations and foundations gave $56 billion. Those are amazing numbers. Americans should be proud. Photos: Down and out in the south . Still, thousands sleep out in the cold. In Atlanta, just down the street from CNN's headquarters, drivers can spot homeless camps under highway overpasses. One caught fire a few weeks ago. Homeless life is stressful and dangerous. Practically every major city in the world is home to people sleeping in the streets. An estimate of homelessness in Paris about a decade ago put the number there at 12,000. Up-to-date figures are bitterly disputed. The consensus among advocates is that numbers have climbed significantly. In the United States, 2010 census figures show some of the highest percentages of ""street homeless"" in California. According to those figures, New York has one homeless person for every 2,506 people, compared with one for every 259 in San Francisco. New York authorities claim to have reduced the number of ""unsheltered"" individuals to about 3,000, 26% fewer than in 2005. The Coalition for the Homeless says statistics underestimate the problem. Some studies show much higher, but that is because the term ""homeless"" includes people living in emergency housing. In this case, we are referring to the worst category of chronic homelessness: people who spend most nights in the streets. Whatever the figure, more can be done. In Sweden, a determined government effort brought the number of people living in the streets to just 280, with thousands receiving help in alternative housing. I once saw a city worker in Stockholm help a homeless man off the pavement and walk with him onto a city bus. The government seems to have a handle on the situation of each homeless individual. Not all places are the same. Cities such as Paris and New York have many more immigrants, more newcomers with fewer connections to the community, with less of a safety net. There is also more poverty, inequality, unemployment. The Christmas Miracle story of the police officer and the homeless man faded in an Internet minute. And then we moved onto the next social-media sensation. But it continued for the man who should have garnered more attention from the beginning. The story is not over. Not for Jeffrey Hillman. Not for any of the homeless people in the streets of New York or Paris, Stockholm or Atlanta, whom we glimpse briefly as we move on with our lives. The shoes help; the cash helps. But the more effective act of generosity, the real miracle, would come if the millions looking at the picture of the generous police officer trying to help a man in need wrote the perfect Chapter 3, pushing for better mental health services, more affordable housing, more job training. For enough attention from the government to those who need it most. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: People moved by story of police officer who gave shoes to homeless man .
She says kind act is great, but wealthy nations must take lead to help the homeless .

"(CNN) -- In times of crisis, when there are great challenges and sorrow, a nation naturally turns to its leader. We see it in the aftermath of the Connecticut school killings, as we have often in the past. That is as it should be, because the president has more power than anyone to shape the course of events. No president embodied that responsibility more fully than Abraham Lincoln, the decision-maker, consoler-in-chief, and single-minded political pursuer of a just cause. As the movie ""Lincoln"" tops the nomination lists for this year's film awards, millions more will rush to see it, probably looking for ""Honest Abe,"" or some such fictional character, from a sketch designed to shape school children into patriotic citizens. Do not expect to find that Lincoln in Steven Spielberg's sometimes brooding, always passionate, extraordinary film. Do not expect to see the giant of the granite monument. This Lincoln is much more interesting, much more complicated, and much more relevant. When history speaks: Lincoln's three lessons for a second term . ""Lincoln"" is brilliant because it shows us that the path of virtue is paved with morally ambiguous choices. The Lincoln of Tony Kushner's remarkable screenplay is not a man whose every decision radiates righteousness. The movie focuses on a few weeks during the last throes of the Civil War as Lincoln sought to pressure Congress to approve the 13th amendment to the Constitution, abolishing slavery forever. In one scene, familiar from the original trailer, Daniel Day-Lewis' Lincoln asks about the war eviscerating the nation, ""Shall we stop this bleeding?"" You might think the answer is ""Yes, of course, the sooner the better."" The film, however, makes an astonishing argument: that Lincoln deliberately allowed the Civil War to go on, even as the South sought to make peace. He did it for political reasons, in order to win passage of the amendment. That theory is not universally embraced by historians, but Kushner makes a credible case. If true, it means Lincoln knowingly allowed thousands to die because he believed that only with the killings unstaunched would he manage to create enough political pressure through the false argument that the amendment was needed to stop the war. ""Think of all the boys who will die if you don't make peace,"" admonishes Preston Blair, the elder Republican operator (whose ""Blair House"" home is now the official state guest house) played by Hal Holbrook, exuding wisdom and aplomb. Lincoln does, and we can only imagine what demons haunt him as he tours battlefields carpeted with the bodies of young soldiers. The movie shows not-always-Honest Abe driven by the morally impeccable goal of ending slavery but repeatedly taking questionable steps in the process. In this realistic view of a romantic figure, there is no disputing the inspiring words of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., a favorite phrase of President Obama's, that ""the arc of the moral universe ... bends toward justice."" But we learn that it can take a muscular push by determined individuals to produce a visible curvature during our lifetime. Lincoln and his allies behave in ways that today would send investigative journalists on frantic pursuits. They prod members of Congress to vote with the president, but often not on the power of the ideal. It is striking just how much America's values and beliefs have changed. A mere 150 years ago they called ""radicals"" the ones who held the fringe belief that all men, including slaves, really are created equal. The radicals, by the way, were primarily Republicans. To obtain the votes of Democrats, Lincoln didn't rely on his verbal gifts. Glowing with determination, he declares, ""I am the president of the United States clothed in immense power. You will procure me these votes!"" From historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, whose biography is one of the main sources of the screenplay, we know Lincoln built a Cabinet from former opponents. From that ""Team of Rivals,"" the man who ran against him for the nomination is now Secretary of State William Seward, played by David Strathairn, as Lincoln's right-hand man in the project. (That may have inspired Obama to bring Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to his Cabinet.) He hires a gang of political operatives to obtain the votes. ""The president is never to be mentioned,"" Seward warns. ""Nothing strictly illegal."" Led by James Spader's shifty character, they offer thinly veiled bribes, lucrative patronage jobs, in exchange for the vote. Lincoln allows the radical Republican Thaddeus Stevens, played by Tommy Lee Jones, to engage in his own dishonorable means in pursuit of the most honorable of goals. The lessons are countless, because the story is told with a heavy dose of realism. Spielberg knows how to make an audience cry. But this is no Capra fairytale; this is not ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."" This is raw politics. We look at the world through the lens of our time. We see today's problems transposed like one of those school art books with the transparent sheet where we can trace an outline over a picture. We will see today's political battles over gun control or the fiscal cliff in the high-pressure machinations. We will see the fight for same-sex marriage in the changing attitudes and the recalcitrant ones. And we will see the challenge, successfully met by Lincoln, of bringing together people of different political parties and different ideologies to achieve major goals, along with the indispensable requirement of a clear vision and an unbreakable determination in pursuit of an ideal. The story carries a sobering message for idealists, who would like to hear the violins play as their hero bravely does everything that is right and noble. And cynics will take the message too far, justifying every kind of deviousness and inflexibility. Everything Lincoln did, at every step, was not free of ethical stain. And yet, his long-term perspective provided a strong moral framework, a context to judge how dark a stain was compared to the one he sought to erase. The Lincoln of ""Lincoln"" is brilliant because it shows a political figure navigating the perilous ambiguities of life, making the decisions that history, 150 years later, has judged heroic and correct. Now, that deserves a giant granite monument, a flurry of awards and the greatest honor of all: a real-life president who emulates Lincoln's courage in times of crisis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: ""Lincoln"" is brilliant because it shows that virtue is complicated .

"(CNN) -- The increasingly convoluted scandal that led to the resignation of CIA Director David Petraeus has become an endless source of speculation, drama and surprising turns of events. There is much we don't know, but a few important facts have emerged with sharp clarity. It's not too early to learn the first few lessons from this continuing saga, which promises to deliver many more for weeks, probably months. Here is some of what we have learned -- and relearned -- so far: . 1. Powerful men, no matter how brilliant and accomplished, can suffer from a form of temporary insanity caused by the interaction of arrogance and libido. Sadly, this is a lesson we see repeated time and time again, across national borders, destroying promising careers and even changing the course of history. Nothing, it seems, not even the highest IQs, the most exclusive security clearances, or the tangible risk of losing it all for the sake of a tryst will stop certain men from pursuing an illicit relationship. Yes, powerful women do it too, but the cases are rare. On the other hand, the parade of men who have destroyed or very nearly killed their careers and their personal lives is endless. News: The Petraeus scandal -- what we know so far . Gen. Petraeus, the most celebrated military officer of his generation, is the most recent addition to the list. We still don't know what's behind tens of thousands of pages of e-mails Gen. John Allen allegedly exchanged with a woman involved in the Petraeus scandal, and there's the curious case of the FBI agent who reportedly sent shirtless pictures of himself to that same woman. We can't say yet which of these characters will join the melancholy list that includes John Edwards, Eliot Spitzer, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Tiger Woods, Mark Sanford, Anthony Weiner, and on and on and on, each with an accompanying cast of heartbroken relatives. (And, by the way, when a powerful man pays a high price for his indiscretions, prepare to see efforts to blame it all on the woman. It's not surprising that the Petraeus case has included countless references to the clothing choices of the general's girlfriend, as if form-fitting outfits made it all seem logical and understandable.) 2. Anything you write in an e-mail can be used against you. Nothing is private, especially not when it goes through Google (Gmail's) hands. If America's top spy, the head of the CIA, can get caught writing secret love letters to his girlfriend on Gmail, nobody's e-mails are safe. Petraeus and his clandestine girlfriend, Paula Broadwell, took some troubles to keep their illicit correspondence safe. They reportedly relied on a trick used by some al Qaeda operatives. They left messages to each other in the drafts folder of an account, the password to which they both knew, thinking they would remain for their eyes only. But it didn't work. When the FBI came calling, Google opened up its shockingly large files, as it does with shocking regularity. Google knows everything about you, and it frequently shares with those who ask. Google's own reports say it passed information to authorities in response to 93 percent of government requests in the second half of 2011. Nothing in Google's hands is guaranteed to remain private. 3. The FBI can investigate practically anyone in the U.S., even the director of Central Intelligence. That's a stunning notion to contemplate, and it says both good and bad things about America. First the good: No one is above reproach, not even a man whose power is vast and often elaborately concealed. In fact, if you ask the world's great conspiracy theorists, they will tell you the CIA can do anything, anywhere, at any time. But its boss got found out by his own country's law enforcement gumshoes. That's amazing. Score a point for the rule of law in America, but subtract one for privacy and another for the randomness of FBI work. It seems rather strange that the FBI decided to pursue a case of harassing e-mails. I was once personally told by an FBI agent, in no uncertain terms, that the FBI had no time to spend on threats sent over the Internet, even if the messages included a threat to kill. News: Is Petraeus pillow talk a security threat? 4. Americans are deeply torn about the question of private morality and the public sphere. There is a nagging sense that the Petraeus case may have cost the United States the service of an uncommonly talented man for no good reason. We don't know all there is to know, and there is a possibility that this is a matter of compromised national security, in which case the invasion of privacy, the destruction of personal lives, and the painful intrusion into the deepest emotional recesses of several families' worlds, could ultimately prove justified. Until more is known, the rest of the world is shaking its head at what could be another baffling case of American puritanism. Zakaria: Why Petraeus will be missed . Americans, meanwhile, are already trying to work out whether it makes sense to even consider the sexual lives of public officials. There is the none-of-our-business crowd, which I believe is gaining strength, pitted against those who would like to keep aiming for strict ideals of morality, on the argument that personal dishonesty reflects a moral failing that will ultimately takes a toll on the work of a public servant; that if a man will lie to his wife, he will lie to his country. This is a questionable proposition. In this case, with Petraeus having achieved such a high level of recognition for his public service, many people seem to almost hope that a genuine national security angle will be found, because it's too difficult to justify the sacrifice of a talented official, or perhaps more than one, over foolish peccadillos. 5. A salacious sex scandal will push everything off the top of the rundown or the front page, especially when the most immediate next challenge is the ""fiscal cliff,"" a dry and arcane topic that will cause most people to change the channel or turn the page. That's one reason we know this strange and twisting case, already involving such a complicated and unlikely cast of characters, will continue to garner enormous attention for a long, long time. The least we can hope is to learn some useful lessons. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Petraeus scandal is far from clear, but we've learned some things anyway .
She says libido and arrogance continue to make accomplished men do stupid things .
She says anything you write in an e-mail is not really private; the FBI can look if it so chooses .
Ghitis: Americans torn about what's public, private; prefer a sex scandal to real issues ."
"(CNN) -- The drama of an American woman who unexpectedly found herself in a Mexican prison has just had a happy ending. But the plight of many other U.S. citizens kept against their will in foreign prisons continues, as anxious relatives desperately seek for a way to gain their release, . Yanira Maldonado's sudden arrest on by Mexican authorities -- who alleged she was transporting drugs, a charge she and her family vehemently denied -- sparked a national outcry. It helped her case that Mexico has good relations with the U.S. Other captives, by contrast, have become the victims of complicated political and diplomatic battles between the U.S. and its foes. Today, there are a number of American citizens languishing in prisons, some of them off the map, their survival at the mercy of powerful players with intricate agendas of geopolitical blackmail. For their families, the ordeal is emotionally devastating and becomes incalculably complicated as they try to figure out whose advice they can trust, how to avoid saying the wrong thing and how best to proceed to gain their loved ones' freedom. Kenneth Bae, the Korean-American owner of a tour company, was just sentenced to 15 years of hard labor, convicted for ""hostile acts"" against North Korea. His sister, Terri Chung, said he was in North Korea as part of his job. ""We just pray"" she said, asking ""leaders of both nations to please, just see him as one man, caught in between."" If Chung has reason for concern seeing her brother in the hands of a regime with little international accountability, the family of Robert Levinson, who disappeared in Iran six years ago, is not even sure who is holding him. Levinson, a retired FBI agent, was working as a private investigator on a cigarette smuggling case when he traveled to the Iranian resort island Kish in March 2007. Almost immediately, he vanished. With tensions running high between Washington and Tehran, the U.S. government believed Iranian intelligence took him as a potential bargaining chip. But Iran denies knowing his whereabouts. For years, there were no signs of life; many thought he'd died. Then more than three years after his kidnapping, the family received a wrenching video of the emaciated father of seven, his voice breaking, asking the U.S. government to acquiesce to his captors' demands: ""Please help me get home."" His wife and son posted their own video, describing Levinson as a loving father and grandfather, begging his captors, ""Please tell us what you want."" Six years after the kidnapping, Secretary of State John Kerry called on Iran and other international partners to help, even though during a 2011 congressional hearing, Sen. Bill Nelson said, ""We think he is being held by the government of Iran in a secret prison."" Another American, Alan Gross, was arrested by Cuba in 2009 while working as a subcontractor for the U.S. government, bringing equipment to allow Internet access to members of Cuba's Jewish community. Diplomatic cables from WikiLeaks show the arrest came during times of heightened tensions between Havana and Washington. Havana accused him of working for U.S. intelligence. He was convicted of ""acts against the independence and integrity of the state"" and sentenced to 15 years in prison. A Cuban Foreign Ministry official explained that ""(t)o demand that Cuba unilaterally release Mr. Alan Gross is not realistic."" Clearly, Gross was a trading commodity. Havana wants to exchange him for five Cuban agents convicted in Miami in 2001, one of them in connection with an incident that ended in the deaths of four Cuban-Americans pilots shot down by the Cuban military. The United States rejects the idea. Kerry declared that ""Alan Gross is wrongly imprisoned, and we're not going to trade as if it's a spy for a spy."" Gross' family says Washington is not doing enough to help. The family has sued the contractor he worked for and the State Department, charging they sent him on his job without proper preparation, training or protection. It's difficult for families to know how much to rely on the government's help and how much to reveal to the public. The family of James Foley, a freelance journalist captured in Syria in November, initially requested a blackout on the news. The fear is that raising a captive's profile can make him seem more valuable to his captors and harder to free. That is a risk, especially in a kidnapping for ransom by nonstate groups. But GlobalPost, Foley's employer, now says it is convinced that Foley was taken by the Syrian government's Shabiha militia and is being held by Bashar al-Assad's forces. Also in government hands now is a California filmmaker, Timothy Tracy, arrested by Venezuelan authorities. His family says he was making a documentary about Venezuelan politics. The government says he was instigating unrest against the government of President Nicolas Maduro. President Barack Obama, during his recent visit to Latin America, called the accusations, ""ridiculous."" When a government is involved, a number of possible avenues of release emerge. In fact, the release can be used as a sign of respect for humanitarian norms or of good will, aimed at easing diplomatic tensions without losing face. These and other family ordeals continue, with little public attention focused on the struggle of people held against their will, pawns in a game in which they wield no influence. For those wanting to help, the best approach is to listen to families' wishes. If they want silence, that should be respected. Otherwise, we should all Tweet, post, write and talk more loudly about the ordeals of Americans held prisoner for political reasons.

"(CNN) -- Can presidential candidates talk to voters like adults? Will voters support a candidate who tells them the truth? The answer to that question is obvious to anyone who has observed American politics in recent years. One day -- let us hope it comes soon -- voters will demand that their political leaders present them with a more realistic sense of the possibilities and choices they face. But for now, voters demand perfect odds and simple solutions, and politicians oblige. President Obama confessed as much in a recent Vanity Fair profile, when he revealed he knows that each one of the decisions he makes as president could turn out wrong. ""Nothing comes to my desk that is perfectly solvable,"" he said. ""Any given decision you make you'll wind up with a 30 to 40 percent chance that it isn't going to work."" But the American public, the president suggested, cannot handle those odds. After you have made your decision, you need to feign total certainty about it. Despite knowing this, Obama did not project that supreme confidence and simplified arguments in Wednesday's debate. Romney did. That was not the president's only problem, but it was one of the reasons he didn't fare well. The frustration showed after the debate, when Obama accused Romney of blatant lying in a debate that, like both campaigns, has been rife with distortions. Both candidates twisted the facts. Romney did it to better effect. It's a tragedy for American democracy that the tactic works. Four years ago, Obama betrayed no doubts that he would succeed in achieving highly ambitious promises. It's harder to speak in dreamy, inspirational platitudes when you've been president for four years, when the prose of real life has not caught up with the poetry of the campaign. Politics: Mitt's middle of the road makeover . The American political system demands charisma, leadership and boundless optimism, even if they are artificial and hollow. Some voters tell pollsters that a ""strong leader"" is one of the most important traits they look for in a candidate. And pollsters track the perception obsessively. But the prevailing idea of what a strong leader is has become manufactured and artificial. Candidates have to sound self-assured and authoritative, in a version of leadership that resembles more the utterances of Donald Trump in ""The Apprentice"" than the wisdom of the great politician-philosophers who founded the country. Real charisma allows leaders to change their mind. But that's different from reshaping your supposed ideology to win different audiences. Intellectual and political honesty are not Etch-a-Sketch tricks. Romney's penchant for telling one audience one thing and then taking it back when it doesn't suit another audience -- as he just did with his infamous ""47%"" comments by saying he was ""completely wrong"" -- does not count as mettle. In the debate, Obama slipped in his efforts to don that leadership mantle. He even acknowledged that some of the choices are a matter of odds, that the country is a laboratory and we can only hope the experiments will turn out well. On the economy, he said, ""Look, we've tried this; we've tried both approaches,"" comparing the Bush approach with the Clinton years. Obama took a step toward honesty with the public in suggesting that we can make only an educated guess as to what strategy is likely to work. ""In some ways,"" he said, ""we've got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans."" Evidence, ""data."" That's not a modern American politician's way of framing a decision. Americans like it when their leaders (and their pundits) are completely sure of what they propose, totally convinced it will work. Politics: Bad debate, good fundraising and jobs report for the president . Some people believe this is the inevitable way of politics. But it doesn't have to be. In other countries facing great problems such as high unemployment and shrinking economies, these days, ""difficult choices"" and uncertain outcomes are the centerpiece of political discussions. Voters are treated as intelligent, responsible adults who have to decide what is the most promising of unpalatable options. Friday's unemployment figures seemed to support Obama's belief in his economic approach. But they don't erase the uncertainty ahead. In the end, we have competing philosophies for facing a world where countless unexpected challenges are sure to emerge. It's true. An appearance of self-assurance creates a reassuring aura of competence and charisma. It makes people feel better. People are drawn to those who seem most sure of their ideas. But being more certain does not make you more right. True charisma and leadership require acknowledging the uncertainties, recognizing the gaps in our knowledge. In the view of presidential scholar Michael Beschloss, they require the courage to tell difficult truths, to make unpopular decisions, to work with people who have different beliefs. Following the current definition, Romney proclaims with absolute conviction, as he did during Wednesday night's debate, that ""the private market and individual responsibility always works best."" And he promises to bring 12 million new jobs while guaranteeing without a hint of doubt that if he is not elected, life will get worse, prices will go up, incomes will come down, and American will become weaker. Opinion: Will improving economy sink Romney? Four years ago, Obama made promises that today sound just, well, sad. After his 2008 win in the Iowa caucuses, he told his exhilarated supporters that he would put an end to years of partisan bitterness and pettiness in Washington. He would be the president who would bring ""Democrats and Republicans together to get the job done."" As a candidate, Obama could draw a dreamy vision. He would bring red and blue states back together, close down the prison at Guantanamo, fight climate change and genocide. His election, he said, would ""mark the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal."" He even vowed to ""reboot America's image in the Muslim world."" Instead, he tackled much greater problems than he had expected even when he exaggerated his competence. The economy, the world, they all proved more complex than the black and white choices of the election. Unemployment is still high. He has made little headway on the environment. Republicans and Democrats remain at each other's throats, and people in Muslims countries are still not fond of America or its president. In the first debate, candidates again avoided talking about the need to make difficult choices. The talk was of tax cuts, not tax (""revenue"" is the euphemism) increases. There are other areas where the choices are difficult and unappealing in foreign and domestic policy. Voters may feel placidly satisfied when the candidates avoid mentioning the dangers ahead or the hard truths. But beneath the wishful thinking, Americans know that the world is complicated, the economy is challenging, the choices difficult. Opinion: Romney's demographic bind . A candidate who tells voters he is 100% certain that the choices are clear and his plans will work out is lying, deluded or foolish. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis asks, Will voters support a presidential candidate who tells the truth?

"(CNN) -- Just moments after Mitt Romney triumphantly introduced Congressman Paul Ryan to American voters on the deck of the battleship USS Wisconsin, I happened to witness a heart-wrenching event on the tarmac of an airport hundreds of miles away: The casket of a fallen service member was returning home to his family in Florida. As I stood silently with a group of passengers watching a small honor guard march to attention, the hearse backing up to the conveyor belt, and the grieving family members holding each other up, I was reminded again that a nation's foreign policy has direct impact on all our lives. If a new president comes to the White House -- if Romney and Ryan win -- will America find itself once again at war? How will the election reshape our policies toward the rest of the world? The selection of Ryan as Romney's running mate has heated the spotlight on the economy, on the huge and growing national debt, and on the large number of Americans who, years after the start of recession, remain unemployed. Sensing Obama's vulnerability, Romney and Ryan would like to keep the focus there. But international conflicts have a way of intruding on the best agendas of American statesmen and political strategists. President George W. Bush did not expect 9/11 (crazy conspiracy theories aside), just as Obama had no idea that the Arab uprisings would transform a key region of the world and test his skill in a series of conflicts, some of which confronted America's values against its alliances. We do know that whoever sits in the Oval Office will face tough decisions on Iran and Syria, two problematic countries that are likely to demand attention at or near the top of the foreign policy rundown. And, we know that when the next presidential term starts, as many as 68,000 U.S. service members may remain in Afghanistan. A look at how Romney and Ryan would respond to the challenges facing America is as revealing as it is stunning. The Republican duo differs dramatically from Obama and Vice President Joe Biden when it comes to economic policy, but on foreign affairs it's hard to find a truly sharp disagreement on fundamental issues, despite dissimilarities in tone. When it comes to cheering America's greatness, Obama was at first reluctant. ""I believe in American exceptionalism,"" he famously said, ""just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism."" He added that he is ""enormously proud"" of America, but the qualified statement opened a new flank. That was in 2009. Obama has since learned his lesson about being shy in praising America. And so did Romney, who tried to draw a distinction with the president by launching his campaign with a book unsubtly titled, ""No Apology: The Case for American Greatness."" In a speech last year, Ryan waxed idealistic about America, talking about the need for ""energetic"" American leadership, about the ""fundamental desire for liberty"" in all human beings and the need to promote our ""moral principles."" But he quickly pulled the soaring idealism back to earth, saying policy should be ""tempered by a healthy humility about the extent of our power."" In other words, do not compromise our values unless we have to. And, by the way, we have to. American exceptionalism: 2012 winner must unite America on ideals . Ryan, who has no foreign policy experience and has spoken little of it, outlined the dilemma facing the U.S. when he spoke about the Arab uprisings. ""We are seeing long-repressed populations giving voice to a fundamental desire for liberty,"" he said approvingly, but then he worried about the possibility that the end of one dictatorship would open the way for another. Regarding Afghanistan, the war in which Americans are serving and dying, Romney and Obama have, incredibly, largely avoided the topic. Despite vague criticisms, Romney is on record supporting Obama's plan to remove American forces. Romney once, a little bafflingly, declared that Russia is America's main foe. In reality, whoever wins the election will need Russia's cooperation on the global stage to counter vital and urgent problems. On Iran, arguably the most important foreign policy question and conceivably a new war front for America, both Romney and Obama have stated that Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. Both have said ""all options"" remain on the table to prevent that from happening, including a military strike. And despite criticism of Obama's approach to Israel, Romney agrees with Obama that Israel is a key ally whose security is one of the non-negotiable aspects of U.S. foreign policy. Romney and Ryan may ultimately speak more forcefully in public settings about the Middle East -- and that is easier to do when you don't yet hold power -- but the fact is that Obama has earned high praise from many Israeli hawks. And if you look closely at Romney's proposals for Iran, what he calls for is more economic sanctions. When Romney took his recent overseas trip, his objective was to highlight differences with Obama. He drew criticism when he called Jerusalem Israel's capital, but that's exactly what Obama said when he was running for office. Obama went even further, saying ""Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel and it must remain undivided."" To be sure, rhetoric and images matter a lot. Obama's effort to win over Muslims, which has largely failed, created the impression that the alliance between Israel and the United States is not as strong as it once was. That image has real world repercussions. And the chill that surrounds meetings between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is real. But the relationship is based on much more than ties of friendship between leaders. The two campaigns have differences in some areas, particularly regarding the future Pentagon budget, which Obama would cut by $500 billion in 10 years. Romney would spend more to expand the Navy, part of a strategy that looks at China as an upcoming rival. That China ""pivot,"" by the way, is shared with the Obama administration. But overall, America's foreign policy choices, based on national interest, national values, strategic considerations and popular opinion, will not significantly change regardless of whether Obama or Romney wins the presidential election. Romney and Ryan, if they win, are likely to up American involvement in the Syrian conflict, and they may well preside over an American conflict with Iran. But Obama may do just the same. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Presidents face unexpected challenges when it comes to international affairs .

"(CNN) -- Giant natural disasters have a way of putting everything in perspective. When it comes to politics, they sometimes put it all in the wrong perspective. With nature suddenly grabbing our attention with both hands and reminding us we have much less control over our world and our lives than we believed, everything else moves to the background. Like a diagnosis of a deadly disease or another personal tragedy, when the earth itself has unleashed its wrath, we look at all that transpires around us through the lens of the new overpowering reality. In the aftermath of a natural disaster, opinions about politicians, about leaders, can change. Covering natural disasters and politics around the world, I have seen people change political opinions. And then wish they had not. Politics: Will you be able to vote on Election Day? A country's leader will receive the credit or the blame for what comes during and after the event, somehow blinding many voters to all they knew about him or her before. Of course, the chief executive does bear responsibility. And the response to a major crisis should be used as one gauge of leadership. But there is a tendency to suffer temporary amnesia: Nothing matters but the reality of the moment. Everything else is clouded in a fog of temporary irrelevance. There are plenty of examples of a temporary surge of emotion following a disaster, which later receded into regret. Each country is different and no circumstances are identical. But it's worth noting the experiences of other voters. Will Sandy affect your vote? I arrived in Thailand not long after the massive earthquake and tsunami that devastated Asia in December of 2004. Thai voters were scheduled to go to the polls just a few weeks later. Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra rolled up his sleeves and got to work on the crisis. He traveled to the regions wiped away by the tidal wave, he visited the survivors, showed himself on television leading the rescue and recovery effort, giving instructions to local officials, refusing international aid, declaring proudly that Thailand could take care of itself. The voters ate it up. Amid the devastation, anxiety and uncertainty, it was reassuring to see a man in charge. And the response was, for the most part, quite good. His approval ratings soared. Before the storm, Thaksin's party was losing ground. But when the February elections came, voters turned out in droves for the prime minister's party, giving him a landslide victory. The seeming consensus did not last long. Thaksin was eventually deposed and charged with corruption. He lives in exile. The Japanese earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear meltdown last year threw a political lifeline to then-Prime Minister Naoto Kan. The prime minister, wearing worker's clothes, appeared to be in control of the situation. But as time passed and the Japanese started questioning the government's response to the disaster, his approval ratings collapsed and he ended up resigning. In 2007, a violent earthquake shook Peru. President Alan Garcia moved his presidential offices to the disaster zone. He brought his cabinet with him and personally managed -- some say micro-managed -- the response. His political advisers were delighted with the impact. Polls showed 76% of Peruvians approved of his handling of the crisis. His personal approval rating soared. After the crisis, the polls started sliding again, dropping to dismal levels, as if the earthquake and his heroic efforts had never happened. In Chile in 2010, one of the world's strongest earthquakes came just after an election. The outgoing government was criticized for failing on many fronts. The newly elected Sebastian PiÃ±era benefited from the disaster. The businessman-turned-politician was praised for his effective management style, and he used it to give himself a lower baseline from which to be judged. ""This calamity is much deeper, much more damaging and much more serious than we thought,"" he said. As others, his approval ratings were bolstered by his competent response to the disaster. But they later collapsed like a ramshackle building in an earthquake. Voters discovered there was more to a good presidency than an impressive display of post-earthquake leadership. When the response is ineffectual and it fits in with a particular narrative, however, the impact can be indelible. That was the case with George W. Bush and Katrina. The ""heck of a job, Brownie"" cluelessness matched an impression of carelessness and incompetence. Natural disasters, like violent storms, can reshape the political landscape. Sometimes the topography returns to its previous state. Sometimes it is changed forever. When a major calamity strikes just before an election, it is a test for politicians, as many have observed. That's why in the United States, with just a week to go before the presidential election, both camps are handling the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy with excruciating political care. That's the politicians' challenge. Opinion: Sandy debunks 'nanny state' There is also an important -- an even more important -- challenge for voters. This is a time of maximum manipulation. It is a time when political operators will seek to mold perceptions to craft a political outcome; to score votes. Voters must make a superhuman effort to not let the storm carry any more weight than it deserves in their judgment of politicians; not to let the storm wash away the knowledge about the candidates and their ideas accumulated over a much longer period. The storm and its aftermath do matter. We want a president who is competent and capable, able to guide the country through a crisis. But there is more. A presidency is more than crisis management. The storm has indeed given us useful information. It has reminded us of topics ignored during the campaign, such as climate change. It has cast a spotlight on the need to have a strong enough government to handle huge, sudden challenges. And it has put an interesting twist on the idea of privatizing emergency disaster operations. We should keep in mind that much of what we see the candidates doing at this very moment amounts to political theater. As American voters see images and hear stories of death and destruction, of water gushing into subway tunnels, of ferocious winds toppling construction cranes, of homes burning, of hospital workers carrying critical patients down emergency stairs, and of brave efforts to recover, it's crucial to remember this is an important moment, but it is not the only moment, not the only test to determine who should be the next president. Because choosing the wrong president could prove an even greater disaster. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis has seen disasters around the world change people's vote .

"(CNN) -- Where's Hillary? Where did she go? Don't bother looking for her this week on the podium of the Democratic National Convention. Don't try to catch a glimpse of her in the backrooms where the powerful gather or on the convention floor where delegates wave signs proclaiming their love for Obama or Clinton (the other Clinton; the husband). No, while Democrats try to stoke the troops with passion for their party and excitement for Barack Obama's re-election, the most popular member of the Democratic Party, possibly the most popular major politician in America, will stay far away from the national spotlight, about 10,000 miles away. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is occupied with other matters, serious matters of state. No time for cheering or voter-rousing. She's keeping her distance from politics, and that might work out just fine in a few years. As Democrats started streaming to North Carolina, she jetted off to the middle of nowhere. Or, more precisely, to the Cook Islands in the Pacific. Look it up. It's far away. By now, Hillary -- as everyone calls her unofficially (and we're speaking unofficially) -- has moved on in her busy Asian itinerary. As you read this, she may be in China, or in Timor-Leste, or perhaps Brunei. The official explanation is that she had important business and as a sitting secretary of state, she is supposed to stay above politics, above the partisan fray. Indeed, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said it is customary for the current secretary to avoid the political season, as she did in 2008. Hillary, however, is not just any secretary of state. She is the woman who almost beat the current president for the nomination. She's the one millions hope will lead the ticket in 2016. She is the one Democrat on everyone's mind this week even if she made it a point to move her operations to the other side of the world. Journalists will find it difficult to ask her opinion about the convention or ask the real question, the one people have not stopped asking in four years: Will she run for president in 2016? The standard answer is that she has no interest in running again and looks forward to private life after Obama's first term. But few people believe she has made that decision. The reluctance to take her at her word stems partly from the stunning phenomenon of worldwide popularity that Hillary Clinton has become. For every one of the past 10 years, Americans have ranked her the Most Admired Woman, ahead even of Oprah when she had her show. Hillary is probably among the most popular women in the history of the United States, having won the title 16 times, more than any other woman. She consistently scores the highest approval ratings of any top member of the Obama administration, and she has developed an extraordinary level of personal rapport with the masses, with the millions who have never met her but have seen her evolve over the decades. People feel an emotional connection after having witnessed the visible pain she endured during her husband's public cheating scandals. They watched her raise her chin, battle adversity and come out ahead. Everyone knows it has not been easy. Liberated from campaigning, she has relaxed. She has become more spontaneous and genuine, leaving behind some of the calculated deliberateness of the politician. Hillary's most private moments seem to fill her admirers with vicarious joy. When images surface of her dancing or drinking a beer during a break from work in Colombia, they immediately go viral. As if people felt glad that she's happy. The Internet parody ""Texts from Hillary"" became all the rage, as it purported to show the ubercompetent SecState whipping the world into line. In one image, President Obama, stretched out on a couch, sends a text, ""Hey Hil. Whatchu doing?"" Hillary, looking stylish in shades, with giant briefing books before her, texts back: ""Running the world."" It's a joke, but it's funny because it reflects an image that has taken hold. Hillary seems to work harder than anyone. She has traveled to more countries -- 108 so far -- than any of her predecessors. She's always at it. And it always seems important. The mere mortals, the regular politicians, are out campaigning, telling half-truths and slinging mud. Hillary's busy, working to keep the world running. As secretary of state, she is in a perfect position to work on issues that are much less controversial than domestic dilemmas. She doesn't need to talk about tax increases, health care reform or the deficit. She doesn't have to spar with the Republicans and look petty or nasty in the process. It makes her look superior to the others. It puts her in great shape for 2016, when she will be 69, not too old to run for president. Hillary first electrified activists back in 1995, when she declared in her famous Beijing speech ""it is no longer acceptable to discuss women's rights as separate from human rights."" And she has never let up on her efforts on behalf of women. But men, too, even the most rugged (even Republicans) have come to respect her. Back in 2010, when a Rolling Stone reporter quoted senior military men in Afghanistan disparaging the Obama administration, he revealed that, ""Only Hillary Clinton receives good reviews."" And she has not stopped getting great reviews. Staying out of the political mud-pit, she is the subject of popularity polls, breathless speculation and gushing profiles, like a recent cover story -- complete with photo spread -- in Conde Nast Traveler. In addition to the glamor and the competence, the writer revealed ""one very intimate detail that most people still don't know about Hillary Clinton."" The secret? ""She does not sweat. Literally. She does not even glow. No matter how high the heat, not a drop nor a drip nor a bead ..."" The polls show voters want Hillary to run again. In Iowa, a look at presidential preferences showed Hillary beating Vice President Biden 60 to 18. No one else reached 5%. In New York, voters want Hillary to run even more than they want their very popular governor to do so. So, while the Democrats shout themselves hoarse in Charlotte, Hillary will be far away, busy with affairs of state. But don't be so sure her absence means she's not interested in politics. Like everyone in Charlotte, she too is probably pondering what Hillary will do in 2016. She may be absent, out of sight. But staying away only makes the Democrats' heart grow fonder. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Hillary Clinton, the most popular Democrat in the U.S., is in Asia tour during convention .

"(CNN) -- If Barack Obama could make three wishes, he would probably ask for the crisis in Syria to go away. That would help him receive another wish: Getting reelected as president of the United States. Unfortunately for Obama, and tragically for the people in Syria, history has brought the American presidential campaign and the Syrian revolution to the same pages of the calendar. That means Obama will do whatever he can, for as long as he can, to keep the carnage in Syria from interfering with his reelection plan. That means the killings in Syria could go on longer than if the uprising had erupted during a nonelection year. Anyone who doubts that electoral considerations have become a major factor in U.S. foreign policy should look to Obama's own words from a few months ago. Obama did not realize his microphone was on during a meeting in Seoul with then-Russian President Dimitry Medvedev, so he leaned in close and whispered, ""This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility."" In this instance, Obama was referring to the contentious issue of missile defense. It's not uncommon for presidents to worry about reelection while charting foreign policy. In Robert Caro's new biography of President Lyndon B. Johnson, ""The Passage of Power,"" he describes how Johnson made decisions about Vietnam with an eye towards the elections. Caro concluded that ""the steps he took had, as their unifying principle, an objective dictated largely by domestic â€” indeed, personal â€” political concerns."" With less than five months until November, the last thing Obama needed on his already very full plate is another shockingly cruel, politically complicated conflict in the Middle East, complete with gruesome, heartrending images, a recalcitrant dictator, and prominent voices calling on Washington to do something. Photos: In Syria, families flee and rebels fight . You can't put history on hold until after Election Day, but you can certainly try. The Obama administration has put other major foreign policy issues on the back burner in order to avoid giving Republicans fodder for criticism, to prevent new risks to the economy, or simply to avoid stepping on a landmine while moving along a dangerous global landscape. A report in Britain's Sunday Times claims that the White House asked Israel to delay an attack on Iran until after November. Many fear that a war with Iran would send oil prices skyrocketing and hurt Obama's reelection prospects. Although that scenario could be averted, the risk of armed conflict creates too much uncertainty during a pivotal year. For now, Obama and the West are backing slow-motion talks with Iran along with economic sanctions. They have significantly reduced their demands from a requirement that Iran stop enriching uranium to a call for Tehran to ""curb"" enrichment to higher grades. Elsewhere in the Middle East, a top Palestinian leader said the Obama administration told Palestinians to be patient this year, with a promise that a reelected Obama, unbound by the need to win votes, would make a forceful return to his mediation efforts. Even with Afghanistan, Obama has been perceived as putting political goals ahead of strategic decisions. Leslie Gelb, President Emeritus of Council on Global Relations, suggested that the November election is the main reason why Obama has not ordered a faster draw-down of troops. ""But wait till next year,"" he wrote. ""The fig leaf of vital interests will no longer be sustainable in the postelection marketplace."" While the Obama administration tries to plug all the holes, or at least slow the leaks until it has more freedom of movement, its timid efforts in Syria are starting to look like an abdication of a fundamental moral duty. The death toll in Syria continues to rise, with more than 13,000 people killed. At this rate, the political cost of doing nothing will outweigh the risk of taking action. There is no obvious, easy answer. And the American people so far seem to have no desire to see American forces step in to stop the horrifying massacres. But Washington could, without sending in American troops, take a stronger leadership role. Pressure is mounting on Obama to launch a more muscular response as Syria unravels and risks creating chaos in other parts of the region. Even Democrats are making a case for American intervention. After all, Syria is Iran's closest ally. Helping to staunch the bloodshed there could help prevent a war with Iran by weakening Tehran's hand. The U.S. could also try to fortify the Syrian opposition and work with other Arab countries who want to see Assad removed from power. For too long, the White House placed its faith in a plan negotiated by former U.N. chief Kofi Annan, which was doomed to fail from the very beginning. Washington has blamed Moscow for the diplomatic stalemate and the lack of progress in Syria, but not everyone buys that argument. Obama would like to prevent a major crisis with uncertain political ramifications from standing in the way of his reelection. But the tragedy in Syria is not waiting until November. Sure, everyone would like to see all the tough geopolitical problems solved by diplomacy, with a handshake and a smile, without massacres of civilians and lies from dictators. But the world does not work that way. Sometimes history has lousy timing. And presidents don't get to make three wishes. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Obama tries to keep the crisis in Syria from interfering with reelection .

"(CNN) -- Calvino Inman had just stepped out of the shower one evening in May when a glimpse of his reflection in the mirror caused him to panic. ""I looked up and saw myself, and I thought I was going to die,"" says the 15-year-old from Rockwood, Tennessee. His eyes were streaming tears of blood. Doctors are still searching for a medical reason for Calvino Inman's tears of blood. Inman's mother, Tammy Mynatt, says she immediately rushed him to the emergency room, but by the time they arrived, the bleeding had stopped. Doctors couldn't see what the family was trying to explain. They returned home completely perplexed. When the bloody tears returned a few days later while Inman was on a camping trip, he was rushed back to the hospital. Mynatt hoped that once doctors finally witnessed the phenomenon, there would be answers. But that wasn't the case. ""The people at the hospital said they had never seen anything like it,"" Mynatt recalls. She says her son underwent an MRI, a CT scan and an ultrasound, but none of the tests had abnormal results. ""'We don't know how to stop it,'"" Mynatt remembers being told by doctors. ""It just has to run its course."" Dr. Barrett G. Haik, director of the University of Tennessee's Hamilton Eye Institute, says there is an answer, sort of. He says ""crying blood,"" a condition called haemolacria, is common in people who have experienced extreme trauma or who have recently had a serious head injury. But a case such as Inman's is still a medical mystery. ""What's really rare is to have a child like this,"" Haik says. ""Only once every several years do you see someone with no obvious cause.""  Watch more on the teen who cried blood » . Haik and a team of researchers published a 2004 study in the Journal of the American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery looking specifically at children who developed unexplained, spontaneous episodes of bloody tears between February 1992 and January 2003. Only four cases were recorded. Because of the rarity of the condition, experts anticipate Inman will have multiple tests from a variety of specialists, including hematologists (blood specialists), ophthalmologists (eye specialists) and otolaryngologists (ear, nose and throat specialists). Dr. James C. Flemming, also an ophthalmologist at the Hamilton Eye Institute, has been in touch with Mynatt and her son. He is reviewing Inman's medical records for possible treatment. Flemming says complications to look for include blood clots, a growth or tumor near the eye, or even a simple infection. He also says the culprit could be something so tiny that none of the standard tests would pick it up. ""It's a very hard thing to estimate,"" Flemming says. ""You may have to watch expectedly for other symptoms to show up."" Inman's analysis would also include a psychological evaluation to rule out the possibility that the bloody tears were faked. ""When you can't find an origin, you can't eliminate any of the possibilities"" Haik explains. He says there have been cases where children seeking attention have found creative ways to simulate haemolacriatic symptoms. Still, Mynatt and her son are relieved to at least have more guidance. In an interview with CNN affiliate WATE, Mynatt was near tears herself explaining her frustration: ""I just truly want somebody to say they've seen this and they can help us."" And that's at least one reassurance Flemming and his team of experts at the Hamilton Eye Institute can offer. ""We get more positive talk now than negative. It really feels like there's hope,"" Mynatt says, relieved. But still, the possibility remains that after endless tests, the underlying cause may never be found. In all four cases Haik examined previously, the bleeding stopped on its own. ""As physicians, that's disconcerting, because we like to have the answers,"" Haik admits. Moreover, he says he knows from previous experience that the toll of not knowing is much worse for patients. ""I could always see the fear in their faces because no matter what we studied, we couldn't find an answer.""","Tennessee teen started crying blood tears in May .

"(CNN) -- Sometimes, when you least expect it, the good guys win. Sometimes, the good guy is a woman -- a strong, wise and extraordinarily brave woman, such as Aung San Suu Kyi. Suu Kyi, 67, has led her people in a decades' long quest for democracy in Burma, the country renamed Myanmar by a brutal military dictatorship, which now appears ready to usher in democratic reform. At a time when the struggle against dictatorships elsewhere in the world seems to bring nothing but disappointment and bloodshed, Suu Kyi's freedom and the richly deserved accolades she is receiving are a welcome reminder that nonviolence, smartly deployed and backed by powerful international supporters, can become a most powerful weapon. This week, Suu Kyi made a triumphant and stirring return to the world stage, traveling to the West, her home for 24 years before she became an accidental leader of the revolution and the regime's prisoner in her home in Yangon, the generals' new name for Rangoon. Suu Kyi was received as a hero in world capitals. She spoke to the British Parliament and received an honorary degree at Oxford University. But the most poignant moment of her five-country trip came when she delivered the Nobel Peace Prize lecture in Oslo, Norway. She gave the speech more than 20 years after her chair had stood empty on the stage during awards ceremony in 1991, the year she won the prize, as she languished in isolation, enduring years of house arrest. ""The Lady,"" as she is known among her countrymen and women, stands as one of the few genuine heroes of our time, someone in the mold of Nelson Mandela and Mohandas Gandhi, who not only inspired by their ideals and sacrifice but, just as importantly, who prevailed in achieving their goals against powerful foes. There was always something mystical about the way the small, willowy woman struck fear in the hearts of the generals -- humorless men in starched uniforms, leading one of the world's largest armies and most ruthless regimes. Her family name was well-known at home before she became an activist. Her father, Gen. Bogyoke Aung San, was the hero of Burma's battle against British colonial rule and a revered statesman. During the first quarter-century after the military took power, Suu Kyi lived abroad, as a mother, wife and academic. But then her mother became ill. She traveled to Burma from her home in Oxford to care for her. Suddenly, she was in the middle of a revolution. When anti-junta protests broke out in August 1988, she addressed a crowd of hundreds of thousands at the iconic Shwedagon Pagoda Buddhist shrine in Yangon. She unexpectedly became the movement's leader and her life changed forever. She would spend 15 of the next 22 years as a prisoner in her own home. The regime put down the uprising (known as 8-8-88) killing some 3,000 protesters. Suu Kyi found herself as a top target of the regime. Even under arrest she managed to lead efforts to topple the dictatorship. The West looked to her for guidance. She looked to her Buddhist faith, learning to understand and endure her own suffering and keep her focus not on herself but on the larger goals of human rights and freedom for all. She told the West to maintain strict sanctions. She feared the world would forget her, as she lived out her life in isolation under heavy guard on Yangon's University Avenue. In 1999, when her husband was dying of cancer in Britain, the junta refused to let him come to Burma to say goodbye, offering instead to let her leave. She knew if she traveled abroad she would never be allowed to return. She stayed a prisoner in Burma and never saw her husband again. Suu Kyi's unique brand of ""realistic idealism"" appears to have succeeded in pressuring the junta to start relinquishing power. She won a seat in parliament in April elections, part of a slow process of promised democratization. She is preparing her party, the National League for Democracy, for general elections in 2015. Her personal story, closely braided with that of her country, proves that nonviolence is not just a philosophy, not just a moral stance. Instead, it is a tool that can bring heavily armed opponents to their knees. The technique worked because her charisma, spirituality and moral courage inspired not only her people, but the rest of the world. That created the pressure to build international economic sanctions that eventually forced the regime to fold. There's more to it, of course. China, the junta's protector, overplayed its hand in exploiting Burma's vast natural resources. But the bottom line is that without international support, the strategy probably would not have worked. Without Suu Kyi, the world would not have known about the misery and repression that the junta had foisted on the Burmese people. Nonviolence is not always a viable course of action -- its slow methods can run out of time, or simply fail against despotism -- but sometimes it can work. I had counted myself as a skeptic -- until I traveled to Burma during the days when it all seemed hopeless and finally understood what her presence there meant to the Burmese people. In Burma and in the Burmese refugee camps on the Thai side of the border, I discovered just what Suu Kyi's strength and personal sacrifice meant to her people. She had become their only source of solace, their only reason for hope. She was also their movement's brilliant strategist. In recent months, the generals who have ruled Burma since 1962 have declared their commitment to democratic change and have started loosening restrictions on political activity. The world is taking its cue from the woman who has become a moral compass. For years she was the one who insisted the West should not lift economic sanctions, even when that meant more hardships for her and her people. But now she says she cautiously believes the generals are serious about reform. Ever the realist, Suu Kyi has warned against overconfidence, calling for ""healthy skepticism"" about reforms. But if she and her supporters do, in fact, forge democracy in their country, as now seems probable, it is because she was able to leverage her appeal to bring harsh international sanctions against Burma. Suu Kyi has proven her wisdom. She has proven she is one of the few people who truly deserve to become a hero, an icon of their time. And she has shown, just when we needed it most, that even in a time of grim realities, heroes can win in the end.

"(CNN) -- So many tyrants to resist, so many heroes to support, but the Nobel Committee decided to ignore all of that and grant the Nobel Peace Prize this year to a large bureaucratic political alliance, the European Union. The committee passed up a chance to give a tangible boost to and put the valuable global spotlight on an individual, a cause or an organization that could really benefit from the award. What a sadly missed opportunity. Peace Prize is a slap on the back for a struggling European Union . Malala Yousafzai, the 14-year-old Pakistani girl shot by the Taliban for advocating girls' right to an education, is precisely the kind of person who should have inspired those making the selection. There's only one Malala, but there are countless people around the world doing heroic work every day, many risking their lives to end tyranny, hunger and illiteracy. I have nothing against the EU. It has accomplished important things, and the Norwegians who award the Peace Prize surely wanted to give it recognition during a time of economic turmoil and political tension in Europe. Still, the Norwegian Nobel Committee wasted the moment. We are living through a time when competing forces are fighting for radically different visions of the future. Activists for democracy, for women's rights, for religious tolerance have faced off against state security forces, religious extremists and brutal misogynists. Zealous prosecutors, loyal to authoritarian regimes, have imprisoned artists, executed homosexuals and tortured democracy activists. Those permitted to nominate candidates gave the panel ideas, a dazzling collection of extraordinary organizations and individuals. The list will remain secret for half a century, but that didn't keep people from speculating about who might win. The favorites included Sima Samar, a doctor and human rights activist who served as Afghanistan's women's affairs minister until she was forced out with death threats for challenging laws that oppress women. There's Maggie Gobran, a Coptic nun in Egypt whose Stephen's Children charity helps Christian children living in Cairo's slums. In Nigeria, where clashes between Christians and Muslims have left hundreds dead and threaten to tear up the country, Archbishop John Onaiyekan and Sultan Sa'ad Abubakar are fighting for reconciliation. In Cuba, blogger Yoani Sanchez struggles for democratic reform in and out of jail, as do other dissidents languish in prison. In Russia, where journalists who criticize the government turn up dead much too frequently, the number of courageous writers and artists standing up for reform includes many courageous figures. The list goes on and on. And, in case anyone doubts just what a difference the Nobel Peace Prize can make, consider some of the inspired choices the Norwegian panel has made. The military junta ruling Burma, which renamed the country Myanmar, had locked up pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose party, the National League for Democracy, won the 1990 election. When she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, her cause -- the plight of the Burmese people -- became the world's struggle. She was not allowed to travel to Oslo for the awards ceremony. But the Burmese people discovered that they were not alone. After many years, including more than a decade of house arrest, she was set free in 2010. She traveled to Oslo to receive the prize in person, and now it looks as though Burma stands at the threshold of freedom. The Peace Prize of 1975 drew attention to the work of Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, the physicist who became, in the committee's words, ""a spokesman for the conscience of mankind."" He spent years in exile in Siberia, but his work helped forge the nuclear test ban and international cooperation. The award became a megaphone for his ideals. In the past, the Nobel committee has proved daring and controversial. This time, it was supremely uninspired. Nonviolent figures such as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the Dalai Lama and Poland's Lech Walesa became household names because they received the prize. Their protest techniques became subjects of academic study and practical guidance around the globe. Their selection inspired last year's winner, Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, author of ""No Enemies, No Hatred,"" another of several Nobel winners who could not attend the awards ceremony because their governments put them in prison or banned them from traveling. The Nobel spotlight can bring donations and needed publicity to a cause. The push for a landmines ban started making headlines after Jody Williams and her Campaign to Ban Landmines won in 1997. True, the committee's choice always upsets some people. But it's more frequently because of boldness than blandness. Naturally, the choice can be politically charged. After Barack Obama won in 2009, with just a few months in office, it left many scratching their heads. When told of the announcement, Walesa said, ""Who, Obama? ... He hasn't had the time to do anything yet."" Obama went on to stun his hosts when he received the award. His Nobel lecture turned out to be a brilliant exposition of when war becomes a requirement for peace. It was not exactly what they expected from a Nobel Peace Prize winner. The decision reflected the committee's hopes more than Obama's achievements. The panel wanted Obama to become the president of peace. He accepted the award, but it turned out he was not a pacifist. The choice for this year also reflects aspirational views. The Norwegian Nobel Committee, selected by Norway's parliament and made up mostly of politicians, is telling the world, specifically Europeans, that they should do whatever it takes to save the European Union. It is asking them to remember that Europe, the continent that in the 20th century perpetrated the worst wars the world has seen, has managed to stay mostly at peace for almost 70 years. The committee gives the credit to the EU. It was a retrospective award, a historical analysis. What the committee should have done was use this chance to take sides and to speak in a way that makes a difference in favor of freedom, equality and tolerance. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","The Nobel Committee awarded the Peace Prize to the European Union .

"(CNN) -- Supreme Court justices are in the top 10% of earners in this country. They attended the best universities and have access to the best health care, a pension plan unaffected by the economy and oh, by the way, immense power. There isn't a socioeconomic litmus test they could take that would result in them being in a class result other than elite. And yet Justice Clarence Thomas, when asked during an interview at the Duquesne University School of Law in April whether he thought he would see a black president in his lifetime, made it seem as if he's on the outside looking in. He said he knew ""it would have to be a black president who was approved by the elites and the media, because anybody that they didn't agree with, they would take apart."" Thomas saying ""the elites"" in that context is like Honey Boo Boo complaining about ""the trash on TV."" People are asked to rise when he goes into the office, and he frames himself as some sort of powerless commoner? He was appointed by President George H.W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate, two symbols of America's elite. No, Thomas is part of the elite class that, in his words, ""approved"" the selection of Barack Obama as the first black president. He can make a distinction between political leanings of those within the class, but that in no way impacts his socioeconomic status. Thomas' remarks are an extension of the anti-elite rhetoric that has always been a part of the fabric of American politics but because of the proliferation of new media seems to have been amped up to a preposterous level. For the better part of three general elections, we have seen well-educated, well-funded, well-connected politicians bend over backwards trying not to appear to be well-educated, well-funded or well-connected. Despite the charade, a study by the Center for Responsive Politics found that the average net worth of last year's incoming freshman in Congress was more than $1 million. The average American household? Less than $67,000. Everyone wants to be seen as a Regular Joe, but no one wants to admit Regular Joes don't get to be president. Or Supreme Court justice. That's not un-American. In fact, if you look at our history, in some ways, that point couldn't be more American. President James Madison, who is sometimes called ""Father of the Constitution,"" came from wealth and attended what is now known as Princeton University. Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, attended the College of William and Mary, rode horses for fun and played the violin. John Jay, another one of our Founding Fathers, was from a wealthy family in New York. What's more stereotypically elite than a rich guy from New York? This country's political dialogue would benefit greatly if we acknowledged that part of history and stopped treating the word ""elite"" like a hot potato. ""Elites"" exist in all 50 states, regardless of whether they're red or blue. ""Elites"" exists in all effective lobbying groups; that's why they're effective. And ""elites"" exist in national media, regardless of the call letters. Fox News has comfortably been on top of the ratings food chain for a number of years now, and yet it continues to brand itself as an outsider, as if it's a weekly alternative newspaper and not a significant part of mainstream media. At one point, Sarah Palin was making as much as $100,000 per speaking engagement and still tried to paint herself as disenfranchised. Last year, Rick Santorum famously misrepresented President Obama's education policy and deemed him a snob for pushing higher education -- while failing to mention his three degrees. But the reason why elites play this branding shell game is because people on both sides of the aisle fall for it. President Obama plays golf with Tiger Woods. Rush Limbaugh pays Elton John $1 million to sing at his wedding. And if you listen to them closely, it's the other guy who's elite. Um, OK. ""I think the president is an elitist, and he thinks he knows what's best for everyone,"" Eric Maynard, a pastor from Flushing, Michigan, told the Washington Post after a Santorum event in February 2012. ""In Michigan, we have a large blue-collar population, and what Sen. Santorum said is right. Not everybody can go to college."" Maynard is right; everybody can't go to college. But what kind of Jedi mind trick has been used on the country when that very idea is offensive?

"(CNN) -- In 2009, Brad Paisley released the song ""Welcome to the Future"" from his album ""American Saturday Night."" In it, he sings about all the cultural changes he's witnessed in his life, including the evolving demographics of the country. He includes glowing references to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks. The election of Barack Obama inspired him to write it. It's important to keep all of that in mind because for some, Paisley's latest song, ""Accidental Racist,"" is making him look like an intentional one. I am reminded of an adage (but with a twist): No good ditty goes unpunished. ""Accidental"" attempts to address a subject matter so few artists in country music are willing to do, which makes Paisley a brave man in so many ways. Paisley, LL Cool J team up for song . Country music fans are notorious for excommunicating those whom they perceive as undesirable (see Wright, Chely). Despite Paisley's immense popularity, if he makes one misstep, everything could be snatched away. And attempting to bring a blue state conversation to red state radio could be one of those missteps. ""I'm not proud that people's ancestors were beaten and held in bondage,"" Paisley told USA Today. ""But I am sure as heck proud of the farm I live on and the Confederate soldier buried there."" Infusing such a dichotomy into a song can be powerful. Unfortunately, ""Accidental"" sucks as a song. The chorus reeks like a '90s boy band ballad. But its greatest sin is that in Paisley's effort to push for racial harmony, it miscasts the country's racial tension -- with emphasis on the Confederate flag and Abraham Lincoln -- as a distant thing of the past. A relic. Meanwhile, those of us in the real world are reading stories about an elected official referring to Mexicans as ""w-----."" No, it's not the 1960s. But if racial tension was really that far back in our rearview, why are students at Wilcox County High School in Georgia fighting to desegregate its prom? Or why was the notoriously liberal Harry Reid impressed with then-Sen. Barack Obama's lack of a ""Negro dialect""? There is a way to talk about race without being consumed with the past or denial of our present. But obviously ""Accidental"" did not find that route. As a result, Paisley is getting hammered for pouring faux apologies on top of a stack of syrupy denials. The most scathing review came from Gawker, which said, ""Brad, I don't think you're the one paying for the 'mistake' of buying and selling human beings."" The song is bad. But the intention is not. His heart is not bad. The questions that ""Accidental"" raised are worth asking. Paisley just did it so awkwardly. Part of the problem with addressing racism is that white people are so afraid of saying -- or in Paisley's case -- singing the wrong thing. But if we're going to usher in the next wave of tolerance, allowing for these ""mistakes"" is important. Besides, minorities don't have all of the answers on the topic either. Case in point. LL Cool J, who is featured in the song, sings: . ""Now my chains are gold but I'm still misunderstood. ..."" Damn LL -- really dude? LL Cool J's proud of 'Accidental Racist' Anyway, I hope ""Accidental"" doesn't scare Paisley away from continuing to push himself or his audience. He could've gone the vacuous love song route, but he aspired for something more. Looking at the results of the 2012 election, the resources being allocated by the Republican National Committee to reach minorities, and the push by both parties for immigration reform, I'd say a song about racial harmony performed by two men from opposite sides of the track was worth pursuing. Yes, the mockery and ""Saturday Night Live"" skit will come. But let's hope the usual knee-jerky ""he's a racist"" label is left behind because Paisley is not a racist. In fact, he's one of the most kindhearted people you could meet. And over the years he's recorded some incredibly powerful songs such as ""When I Get Where I'm Going"" and ""Letter to Me."" Paisley performed ""Welcome to the Future"" in the White House for the president. And the song hit No. 2 on Billboard's country music chart. Given that, I'd say the impetus behind ""Accidental"" was worth chasing -- even if he and LL tripped and fell along the way. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: Brad Paisley's song ""Accidental Racist"" provokes criticism .
Granderson: It was brave of Paisley to try to address racial issues in country music .
He says that ""Accidental"" raises provocative questions, but Paisley did it awkwardly .

"(CNN) -- You would think that in the shadow of a general election dubbed ""Year of the Woman,"" the last thing any Republican in Washington would want to do is tick off women. And while the Violence Against Women Act passed in the Senate by a healthy bipartisan majority a few hours before President Obama's State of the Union address, the fact that 22 senators -- all Republicans, all men -- voted against it should be troubling to GOP leaders. And perhaps the most troubling aspect of that is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the so-called savior of the Republican Party, was one of those Republican men. Just think: A few hours before Rubio was to deliver a message reflecting a new Republican Party, he casts a vote that screams more of the same. The jokes about him fidgeting like a 5-year-old and chugging water during the rebuttal will eventually go away. But if he's seriously thinking about running in 2016, that one vote is going to come back to haunt him. Especially if a revitalized Hillary Clinton, and her 18 million cracks in the ceiling, is in the race. Domestic violence vote key test of more inclusive GOP . In a statement, he said he ""could not support the final, entire legislation that contains new provisions that could have potentially adverse consequences. Specifically, this bill would mandate the diversion of a portion of funding from domestic violence programs to sexual assault programs, although there's no evidence to suggest this shift will result in a greater number of convictions."" The Senate-version of reauthorization extends protections to Native Americans, gays and lesbians, and immigrants. It would allow the prosecution of non-Native Americans for abusing Native American women. Regarding that, Rubio said he voted against the bill because of ""concerns regarding the conferring of criminal jurisdiction to some Indian tribal governments over all persons in Indian country, including non-Indians."" Translation: From a political standpoint, Rubio blew it long before he lunged off-camera to grab a swig of water. And Democrats wasted little time pointing this out. GOP's Rubio rips Obama . Voting against a bill to help women because you're not happy about the amount of money being spent on domestic violence vs. sexual assault is splitting some pretty fine hairs and just isn't choosing the right fight. Especially when juxtaposed against the success of the programs. From the time the act passed through 2010, intimate partner violence declined by 67%. There has also been an increase in the arrests of suspects in domestic and violent sexual crimes. The new legislation has a provision that speeds up DNA analysis in rape cases and a program to fight human trafficking. And if spending was a concern, the $659 million the Senate approved for Violence Against Women programs for the next five years is actually 17% less than the amount approved in 2005. How could the face of a new, kinder, women-friendly Republican Party say no to that? Perhaps the reason why he needed water during the rebuttal is because he got cotton-mouthed listening to his party's resounding approval when Obama mentioned the Senate passing the bill during the State of the Union address. Or maybe he felt a tad faint when House Speaker John Boehner was seen looking over and talking to Vice President Joe Biden -- who co-wrote the first incarnation of the bill nearly 20 years ago -- as he clapped in support. Talk Back: Is giving the State of the Union response a political 'kiss of death'? And trust me, Boehner did not spend a lot of time applauding Obama or talking to Joe. This week, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who is spearheading the negotiations of a House bill, and Boehner received a letter from 17 House Republicans urging them to take action, stating that the act's ""programs save lives, and we must allow states and communities to build upon the successes of current VAWA programs so that we can help even more people."" The GOP knows that between the embarrassing remarks about rape made by several candidates during the last election cycle, the record 20 seats held by women in the Democratic-held Senate and the 55% of women who voted for Obama, regaining power requires a makeover. Rubio appeared to be someone who could embody that change, but he didn't do himself any favors Tuesday. Not with his rebuttal and certainly not with this vote. Opinion: A kinder, gentler, wiser Marco Rubio . ""Mr. President,"" Rubio said in his speech, ""I don't oppose your plans because I want to protect the rich. I oppose your plans because I want to protect my neighbors."" I'm going to assume none of his neighbors are women. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: Rubio one of 22 male GOP senators to vote no on Violence Against Women Act .
Granderson: Just as Rubio was to show new face of GOP, he cast a vote that's the old face .
Rubio's reasons were absurd, he says, in light of a bill that really works to protect women .
Act's funding 17% less than in 2005, he says. How could a women-friendly GOP say no?"
"(CNN) -- The tragic news from Syria managed to become even more shocking Monday when the regime issued an unprecedented threat to use chemical and biological weapons. The warning, which came couched in deceptively reassuring language, makes it clearer than ever that the world cannot afford to act merely as an interested spectator as Syria unravels in a tangle of shrapnel and blood. Syria had always denied that it owned any chemical or biological weapons. But the denial ended this week when Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi issued his peculiarly veiled threat. ""No chemical or biological weapons will ever be used,"" Makdissi said before flashing the thunderbolt of an exception: ""Unless Syria is exposed to external aggression."" The weapons, he said, acknowledging their existence for the first time, are under supervision of the Syrian armed forces. Syria says it has weapons of mass destruction in case of foreign attack . The regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has long described the uprising against his rule as a terrorist revolt and a ""foreign conspiracy."" Makdissi himself promptly described the opposition as the work of foreign extremists, conceivably synonymous with the ""external aggression"" that would qualify for chemical attack under these new rules of engagement. The U.S. has placed most of its efforts on diplomacy, even while al-Assad's forces have killed more than 15,000 protesters. Diplomacy has gone nowhere, but the fighting continues unabated, and the humanitarian catastrophe escalates. As with every other uprising in the Arab world, with the exception of Libya, Washington has tried to play delicately, seeking a nuanced approach that keeps it from taking center stage in the conflict, speaking out from the sidelines and gently moving events along. If anyone needed more information about the stakes and the urgency in this conflict, the latest threat provides it. American combat forces should stay out of the conflict, for now, unless Syria unleashes chemical weapons directly or indirectly. But the U.S. should play a much more active role helping overthrow al-Assad. It's time for Washington and its allies to throw their support more forcefully behind elements of the opposition whose ideas most closely match the West's views on democracy, equality and rule of law. Opinion: Preparing for Bashar al-Assad's exit . Many have rightly worried about who makes up the opposition. There is no question that elements of al Qaeda and other religious extremists are fighting with the rebels. But the opposition also includes members whose views more closely align with the ideals of democratic pluralism that are consistent with America's. Syria is a diverse country, with large Christian, Druze and Kurdish minorities. America can stand back and hope for the best, or it can move forward and start financing and providing substantial intelligence and logistical support to the opposition members who, to the best of Washington's knowledge, might uphold the right values once in power. There are no guarantees, but members of the opposition who have more resources become stronger inside their movement. America could help fortify ideological moderates by helping them in their fight. As we have just seen in Libya, moderate forces can benefit from the influence they acquire when they enlist foreign support. This is not to deny that extremists could end up gaining power in Syria. But that only makes it more important to help steer the conflict towards the best possible outcome. As al-Assad's grip loosens, what could come next? Consider the alternatives. Al-Assad could survive, or the civil war could grind on for years. It now looks as if al-Assad is losing ground, but other regimes have survived strong uprisings. If al-Assad's rule survives, it will mark a defeat for the Syrian people, for America's friends in Lebanon and for U.S. allies throughout the region. It would constitute a major victory for tyranny, a triumph for Iran and for Hezbollah. A victory for al-Assad would fortify and embolden the forces in the Middle East that oppose peace between Israelis and Palestinians, those who despise the U.S. and the West, the enemies of secularism, of equality for women and of ethnic and religious tolerance. This is a war for dominance over the region, not just for one regime's survival. Al-Assad, despite his English education and modern tailored suits, has aligned himself with and actively supported the worst most anti-democratic, retrograde forces in the region. For decades, his friends have sowed terror around the world. Syria helped transfer thousands of Iranian missiles to Hezbollah, a disruptive anti-Western, rejectionist organization whose manifesto declares ""Our struggle will end only when this entity (Israel) is obliterated."" Israel is already deeply worried about al-Assad handing chemical weapons to Hezbollah, which has 50,000 conventionally armed missiles aimed at Israel and managed to fire 4,000 rockets at Israeli civilian targets in the 2006 war. The possibility that the fighting could spread throughout the region is frighteningly easy to envision. Iran, al-Assad's closest ally, has been held responsible for masterminding terrorist bombings as far away as Argentina. Its current defense minister, along with the former president and former foreign minister, in fact, are targets of an Interpol arrest warrant for one of those attacks. And we're not even mentioning the nuclear issue, which exponentially increases the stakes. Faces of the Free Syrian Army . Now that al-Assad's regime has introduced the option that major mass-casualty weapons could enter the conflict, it has eliminated any doubts about the need to bring an end to the al-Assad family's brutal rule. It has also highlighted the importance of helping establish a responsible government in its aftermath. According to the independent Federation of American Scientists, ""Syria has one of the largest and most sophisticated chemical weapons programs in the world and may also possess offensive biological weapons."" Its arsenal contains nerve agents, cyanide, mustard gas and other weapons, along with the capability to fire them with Scud missiles, anti-tank rockets and anti-aircraft missiles. When U.S. intelligence analysts saw military activity around Syria's chemical stockpile sites, Washington warned al-Assad that using them would ""cross a serious red line."" It's time now for more clarity. After Syria warned that Damascus might resort to chemical weapons, German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle called the threat ""monstrous,"" and British Foreign Secretary William Hague called it ""unacceptable."" The European Union declared itself ""seriously concerned."" President Barack Obama said it would be a ""tragic mistake"" to use the weapons. There's no need for subtlety. Al-Assad should hear that NATO will intervene directly if he uses chemical or biological weapons or if he gives them to his dangerous allies. At the same time, Washington and its allies should make a concerted and decisive push to help the Syrian people remove al-Assad from power. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- The sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, lashed out Thursday at Justice Department officials, calling their civil lawsuit alleging civil rights violations against him and his county politically motivated. ""They're using me for the Latino vote, showing that they're doing something, taking on the sheriff over an alleged racial profiling,"" Joe Arpaio told reporters in Phoenix. He vowed to defend himself, not for selfish purposes, but to help the thousands of other sheriffs in the country avoid finding themselves in similar situations. ""I'm not going to surrender my office to the federal government,"" he said. ""I will fight this to the bitter end."" Arpaio rejected the Department of Justice's call for monitors to oversee the workings of his department. ""That shows you they want to take over this office,"" he said. ""Under this agreement with the so-called monitor, I'd probably have to clear every press release before I go public, especially having to do with illegal immigration, with the Department of Justice."" Arpaio's remarks came hours after the Justice Department filed the civil lawsuit. ""At its core, this is an abuse-of-power case involving a sheriff and sheriff's office that disregarded the Constitution, ignored sound police practices, compromised public safety, and did not hesitate to retaliate against perceived critics,"" said Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez. The Justice Department had delivered in December a report with findings of civil rights violations and sought to fix them through a negotiated settlement with Maricopa County and its sheriff's office. Those talks broke down in February over Maricopa's refusal to consider any agreement that involved an independent monitor, Perez said. ""Attempts to forge solutions to address the serious civil rights and public safety concerns have proven elusive,"" Perez said. According to the civil complaint, the sheriff's office has displayed a pattern of discrimination against Latinos, which includes racial profiling, unlawful detention and searches, and unlawful targeting of Latinos during raids. The complaint also alleges that Maricopa detention officers discriminated against Latino prisoners in the jail. The targets were often prisoners who don't speak English well, Perez said. The jailers would give orders only in English, and when the prisoners didn't understand, they would place an entire area of the jail on lockdown for disobedience. ""This incites obvious and unwarranted hostility toward the inmates, potentially placing prisoners and officers alike in harm's way,"" Perez said. Finally, the complaint recounts a number of cases in which Arpaio and his office allegedly retaliated against perceived enemies. These included judges, lawyers and community leaders who were critical, or perceived to be critical of Maricopa policies. ""Nobody is above the law, and nobody can misuse the legal process to silence those with different opinions,"" Perez said. ""Leadership starts at the top, and all of the alleged violations outlined in the complaint are the product of a culture of disregard for basic rights within MCSO that starts at the top and pervades the organization."" The December letter said detention officers in Arpaio's jail invoked slurs and profanities against Latinos, calling them ""wetbacks,"" ""Mexican bitches"" and ""stupid Mexicans."" Arpaio has denied any discrimination, and one of his attorneys called the Justice Department investigation a ""witch hunt.""","NEW: ""They're using me for the Latino vote,"" Arpaio says of the lawsuit .

"Washington (CNN) -- Late one night, in the summer of 1958, three police officers opened an unlocked door of a small home in rural Virginia, walked into the bedroom and pointed a flashlight at a couple sleeping in the bed. ""What are you doing in bed with this lady?"" the sheriff asked. The startled husband pointed to the marriage certificate that was hanging on the wall. ""That's no good here,"" the officer replied. And that night, in the summer of 1958, a husband, who happened to be white, and a wife, who happened to be black, were arrested and placed in a county jail for unlawful cohabitation. That, as The New York Times recounted it, is how the landmark Supreme Court case known as Loving v. Virginia was started -- with bigotry looking at a marriage certificate and saying, ""That's no good here."" Today we know that in 1967 the Supreme Court ruled that Virginia's ban on interracial marriages was unconstitutional. But it's important to remember that a 2012 Pew Study found that only 63% of all Americans ""would be fine"" if a family member were to marry outside of their race, meaning nearly a third would still have a problem. The laws have changed, but sadly, our culture in many aspects, still lags behind. Which explains why once again bigotry has dragged marriage to the halls of the Supreme Court. On Tuesday the justices heard oral arguments in Hollingsworth v. Perry, the challenge to California's Proposition 8. On Wednesday, the court is hearing oral arguments in United States v. Windsor, the case challenging the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA. Both Proposition 8 and DOMA do what that sheriff did to the Lovings 55 years ago. Back then the legally sanctioned discrimination was called racism. Today it's homophobia. Both are offsprings from the same parents: bigotry and fear. Before sentencing the Lovings to a year in prison, Leon M. Bazile, the county circuit judge, opined God placed the different races on separate continents ""and but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages."" Edith Windsor's battle for equality . In an exchange with Chief Justice Earl Warren, R.D. McIlwaine, the assistant attorney general of Virginia, compared interracial couples to people who were mentally ill and said that ""interracial marriages are definitely undesirable. ... (T)hey hold no promise for a bright and happy future for mankind."" Hindsight affords us the ability to shake our heads and laugh at the men who tried to hide their bigotry behind God or the future of mankind. But are the reasons against interracial marriages brought up by McIlwaine and Bazile that much different than the rationale that is being used today to ban same-sex marriages? At a rally on the steps of the Supreme Court, I heard story after story from loving, committed same-sex couples who had been together 10, 20, 30, even 55 years. There were speakers such as Cleve Jones, who created the AIDS Memorial Quilt, and Robert Kabel, a special assistant to President Ronald Reagan who helped form the Log Cabin Republicans. There was one woman suffering from multiple sclerosis who had to be helped up the stairs to the podium by three men so she could stand next to her wife and share her story. No one who came to the rally was asking for permission to love. They were not seeking special rights or begging for a seat at the table because they've been sitting at the table the whole time. They know 14 times the Supreme Court has called marriage a fundamental right. And just as Loving v. Virginia shamed bigotry and those who argued in support of discrimination, this week bigotry will once again be shamed, dragging those who seek to ban same-sex marriages with it. Couple at center of Prop 8 case . An example of this shaming came in an exchange with Charles J. Cooper and Justice Elena Kagan. As Cooper propped up the notion of ""responsible procreation"" as being the reason why marriage should only be between a man and a woman, Kagan destroyed this reasoning, saying, ""Suppose a state said, ... Because we think that the focus of marriage really should be on procreation, we are not going to give marriage licenses anymore to any couple where both people are over the age of 55,"" adding, ""I can just assure you, if both the woman and the man are over the age of 55, there are not a lot of children coming out of that marriage."" Of course ""responsible procreation"" is just another ruse to hide bigotry. Gay couples don't become parents by accident. I know of one couple who wanted children so badly, they drove from Phoenix to Los Angeles every weekend for a year to spend time with the child they eventually adopted because gay adoption was not legal in Arizona. If you do the math, that's about 740 miles round trip for 52 weeks, or 38,480 miles. So if ""responsible procreation"" is the fight Cooper wants to take up, he should direct his focus elsewhere because gay people don't accidentally drive 38,480 miles to have a kid. What Cooper and his allies must remember is that marriage licenses are not scarce resources to be horded but a doorway to more than 1,000 federal benefits and the public declaration of love. And just as interracial marriages did not cause ""traditional"" marriage to fall -- something that was also said during Loving v. Virginia -- neither will same-sex marriages. It wasn't right for anti-miscegenation laws to march into our bedrooms in the summer of 1958, and it's not right for Prop 8 and DOMA to do it now.

"(CNN) -- When then Sen. Obama was running for president, many of his critics accused him of being a Muslim -- as if being a Muslim in a country that prides itself for its freedom of religion is a bad thing. In fact a Pew Research Center poll taken October 2008 found 16% of voters who identified as conservative Republicans thought he was, despite numerous photos of him and his family attending a traditional Christian church. Despite Obama saying he was a Christian. In July 2012, that number increased to 30% despite more photos of him attending a Christian church. Despite Obama repeating he is a Christian. In 2008, his critics accused him of not being born in the U.S.-- despite the Republican governor of Hawaii verifying that he was and birth announcements from 1961 in the state's two primary newspapers . So in 2011, to appease these critics, Obama released the long form of his birth certificate. And in 2013 a poll taken by Fairleigh Dickinson University found that 64% of Republicans believe Obama ""is hiding important information about his background and early life, which would include what's often referred to 'birtherism.' "" Or as I like to call it -- craziness. Which brings us all to Skeet-gate. Opinion: More gun mayhem, and yet we wait for action . In yet another attempt to appease irrational critics, the White House released a photo of the president shooting a gun to prove he is not an enemy of the Second Amendment and that he has in fact shot a gun before (as if that's required to not want criminals or the mentally ill to have access to semi-automatic weapons.) And surprise, surprise skeptics are not satisfied, saying the picture is fake and his affinity for shooting phony, even though there's evidence of President Obama talking about practicing shooting a rifle with members of the Secret Service way back in 2010. ""One picture does not erase a lifetime of supporting every gun ban and every gun-control scheme imaginable,"" said Andrew Arulanandam, spokesman for the National Rifle Association. Well Arulanadam should tell Michael Bloomberg about all of Obama's gun-control support because it seems each time there's been a mass shooting the outspoken mayor of New York tears into the president. ""The president has spent the last three years trying to avoid the issue, or if he's facing it, I don't know of anybody who has seen him face it,"" Bloomberg said on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" days after the Aurora shooting. Bloomberg was right of course. As a candidate in 2008, Obama talked about reinstating the federal ban on assault weapons, but he hadn't aggressively addressed guns from a policy perspective until December's Newtown tragedy. In fact, in a blatant display of hypocrisy, while the NRA demonized Obama for something he didn't do, they endorsed Mitt Romney, who actually did sign a law banning assault weapons while governor of Massachusetts. But those are all just facts. And when you're dealing with crazy people, it doesn't really matter how many facts you present, because -- well -- they're crazy and they're just going to believe what they're going to believe. Ted Nugent sings praises of gun ownership . I thought the president learned this lesson after the whole Muslim/birther slander hurled his way in his first term. But, barely a couple of weeks into his second term, here Obama is once again releasing photos in an effort to silence irrational critics who pay no attention to the facts. Some of his critics are justified in their challenges to his policies because the facts don't support some of his administration's claims. Some critics are concerned about the direction of the economy and legitimately think he is doing a sub-par job. But there are some who just want to watch his world burn and they don't give a damn what else or who else burns with him. And it doesn't matter how many documents the White House releases, Obama simply will not win those people over. ""A lot of people want to see his college transcripts,"" Donald Trump said in an interview with CNBC last year. ""They're not looking at his marks, his grades. ... They want to see, what does he say about place of birth. Now, those transcripts have disappeared, nobody seems to be able to get them."" After college transcripts it will be his marriage license. Then fingerprints. Then toe nail clippings. This constant push to prove ""he's not one of us"" is not going to go away. So the next time the NRA or Trump or whoever else feels the need to question Obama's cred, instead of posting pictures of him shooting a gun or going to church or what have you, he should post a graphic showing he's the first president since Eisenhower to capture at least 51% of the popular vote twice. Obama still backs new gun ban; top senator less certain . That mandate from the American people is really all the cred he needs. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: Obama has been challenged on his religion and place of birth .

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday, a man identified by authorities as Jimmy Lee Dykes boarded a school bus as it stopped to drop off children and demanded two students. Police say that when the bus driver, Charles Albert Poland, refused, Dykes -- who was arrested last month, accused of shooting at neighbors in a dispute over a speed bump -- shot Poland four times, killing him. As I'm writing this, he is in a standoff with police, who say he's holding someone's 5-year-old boy hostage in his underground doomsday bunker. Also on Tuesday, 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton was gunned down in Chicago, allegedly by someone who thought she and her friends were members of a rival gang. It was raining, and the teens were standing underneath a shelter in a park. A park that is about a mile north of the home of President Obama's home. And just a little over a week ago, Pendleton was a participant in Obama's inauguration festivities as a member of the King College Prep band. That's just one day in the life of America. ... I wonder what tomorrow will bring. A Pew Research Center poll found that 85% of Americans back a universal background check to limit the ability of convicted felons and the mentally ill to get a gun -- and yet we wait. On Wednesday, the NFL announced that the Super Bowl pregame show will feature a performance of ""America the Beautiful"" by 26 students and faculty members from Sandy Hook Elementary School. The Sandy Hook massacre was supposed to change things, change us. And yet we wait. Even while the NFL announced its gesture, a gunman whom police identified as 70-year-old Arthur Harmon went inside a Phoenix office building and shot three people, one fatally. And yet we continue to wait -- hoping tomorrow doesn't bring more senseless shootings, more gunned-down babies, more pleas for change. Pendleton deserves more. The victims of Newtown deserve more. With so much blood flowing through our streets, the issue of gun control should not belong to red states or blue ones. It should be wedded to the idea that we deserve more. But as long as cowardly politicians continue to have their sense of morality held hostage by the National Rifle Association, we will continue to wait, even as more loved ones are violently taken from us. You know, John Adams said there was nothing he dreaded more than ""a division of the republic into two great parties, each arranged under its leadership, and concerting measures in opposition to each other."" And Thomas Jefferson once said he ""never submitted the whole system of my opinions to the creed of any party of men whatever, in religion, in philosophy, in politics or in anything else where I was capable of thinking for myself."" I wonder how many more days will pass, how many more lives will be lost, before the people who claim to love our forefathers so much actually take heed of some of the words they said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Well, that settles it: CBS' Bob Schieffer must be straight. Not that I spent time thinking about his sexual orientation before but that's the first thing that popped in my mind when the legendary newsman, in critiquing President Barack Obama's inauguration speech, said, ""There were no real memorable lines."" Maybe not for straight people, but there were not a whole lot of gay people who will forget this: . ""Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well."" That was the first time the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community was mentioned in inaugural address. I'd say that passage was pretty memorable. And while we've all heard this president mention the rights of gays in speeches before -- what was unique about the inauguration, what really moved me and a lot of people engaged in this particular struggle, was this: . ""We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths -- that all of us are created equal -- is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall."" Seneca Falls refers to the first women's rights convention held in Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848. His mention of Selma was a nod to the civil rights march in Selma, Alabama, in 1965. And Stonewall? After years of being harassed by police, even arrested for dressing differently or simply walking down the street, the patrons of the Stonewall Inn finally had enough. So after another humiliating raid at a Greenwich Village bar by the name of Stonewall Inn, they fought back. That was June 28, 1969. That moment is credited with being the single most important event in the gay rights movement. The community came together. Groups were formed. Significant cultural change had begun. In mentioning Stonewall, with not only the nation, but the world watching, Obama gave more than a passing acknowledgment to a group of people who were instrumental to his re-election. He stopped, looked us in the eyes, and said: I see you. Maybe if you've never had to worry about not being promoted ""if someone found out""; maybe if you've never had to switch pronouns or leave your better half at home for fear of being fired; maybe if you've never had to worry about health insurance for your children or pay extra taxes because your state doesn't recognize your family; maybe if you've never sat in a church and had a preacher tell you that your family isn't a family at all, that your loving relationship is wrong, that who you are is inherently wrong, then I could see how someone could view the president's speech as lacking in memorable lines. But the Association of Bragg Officers' Spouses recently offered the wife of an Army lieutenant colonel an invitation to join the group as a ""special guest"" -- not as a spouse -- for one reason: sexual orientation. So despite being legally married, despite a 15-year relationship, despite the overturning of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" the blatant discrimination and bullying of LGBT people continues. So the mentioning of Stonewall did not pass by everyone's ears unnoticed. In fact as I made my way from the frozen lawn in front of the U.S. Capitol, past the parade route and eventually to one of the evening's balls, it was clear to me that the passage in Obama's speech was more than a memorable line. It was a rallying cry. That's not to say the work is done but rather Bayard Rustin, and Harvey Milk and Del Martin and the countless souls who have since moved on, did not fight for this notion of full equality, in vain. It took 44 presidents, 57 inaugurations and 224 years before the LGBT community was mentioned in an inauguration speech -- but the community was finally mentioned. That seems pretty memorable to me. At the beginning of the ceremony, Sen. Chuck Schumer drew our attention to the construction of the Capitol, particularly the Statue of Freedom that stands at the top of the dome. He pointed out it was a freed slave, Phillip Reed, who helped to cast the bronze statue, which was placed there December 2, 1863, not even a year after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. To hear that story on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, as the nation's first black president was being sworn in for a second time, was a reminder to all of us that at times equality can feel like a slow train coming ... but we cannot grow weary because it is coming.

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- If September 11, 2001, was the day everything changed, then April 15, 2013, serves as another reminder of that change, of our frailties and of a new reality in which ""it can't happen here"" has been replaced by ""it can happen anywhere."" When initial reports came out of Boston about two explosions occurring near the finish line of the 116th marathon -- a marathon that began with 26 seconds of silence in honor of the 26 victims of the Newtown massacre -- we held our collective breaths and hoped it was a freak infrastructure accident. Or compromised electrical wiring. Or a gas leak. Anything other than ... President Barack Obama did not say the word ""terrorism"" in his brief address, perhaps waiting until more facts are learned. We don't know how many are responsible, we don't know motive, if any, and we don't know whether it's domestic or foreign. But we do know the FBI said the explosions were well-planned. We know the Boston Marathon is seen around the world. And we know three people are dead, including an 8-year-old boy, more than 100 are injured, and countless lives have been scarred. Get up-to-the-minute updates on CNN.com's live blog . So if September 11, 2001, was the day our innocence was taken, then April 15, 2013, is the reminder that it is never coming back. And we do not need the president to say the word to feel the word. It is felt each time we have to take off our shoes at the airport, have an TSA officer pat us down, throw away a tube of toothpaste because it's over the allotted 3.4 ounces. The FAA temporarily restricted flights over the bombing site while security was increased in cities as far away as Miami and Los Angeles. We do not need the president to say the word to feel it. I was in central London earlier this month and was having a difficult time finding a garbage can whenever I had something to discard. Finally, I asked some of the residents why it was so hard to find one and was reminded that the Irish Republican Army hid bombs in garbage cans during the 1990s and as a result they are still seen as a security threat. This is what happens when evil like the kind experienced in Boston takes away our innocence. It forces us to empty our pockets, have our bags inspected and remove trash cans from the streets of a major international city. We don't need the president to say the word to be reminded constantly that if we see something, we need to say something, blurring the lines between a healthy awareness of our surroundings and irrational paranoia. But then again, is our paranoia that irrational if something as celebratory as the Boston Marathon is no longer a safe place to be? If September 11, 2001, made you cry, then April 15, 2013, should make you angry. All of the laws, the creation of Homeland Security, the trillions spent, the political grandstanding and debates and yet the best we can do is make the country safer. We will never, ever be safe again. Not in the way many of us remember being safe growing up. When I'm in a large crowded space, I check for emergency exits ... and I hate it. But like love and good, evil is an omnipresent force imposing itself on the rest of society like an untreatable cancer. So while Obama telling the American people those responsible will ""feel the full weight of justice,"" we are haunted by the fact that ""justice"" won't bring the victims back. ""Justice"" won't undo the fear embedded in the people who were closest to the blast. ""Justice"" won't take us back to September 10, 2001 ... back before the word ""terrorism"" was on the tip of every American's tongue. And make no mistake, while the president did not use that word in his news conference, that is the word federal authorities are using. Doesn't matter if the culprits of this heinous act came from afar or home. The origin of the person or persons responsible won't bring us the peace that we took for granted not so long ago. That peace is gone, forever. Our children will hear stories about this peace and our children's children will treat it as a fairy tale. If April 15, 2013, was the day the Boston Marathon became a target for terrorism, then September 11, 2001, was the day we all were warned that it would be. Since then nothing has been the same. Nothing will be the same. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: April 15, 2013, bombings a reminder of ever-present threat of terrorism .

"(CNN) -- Presidents, prime ministers and assorted rulers, consider that you have been warned: A massive protest can start at any time, seemingly over any issue, and can grow to a size and intensity no one expected. Your country's image, your own prestige, could risk unraveling as you face the wrath of the people. The newest iconic images from Turkey and from Brazil -- two countries that have promoted themselves as models to emulate -- include shocking scenes of police brutality, of government clampdown against peaceful protesters. We have entered a new age of protests. While politics remain intensely local, individuals are more interconnected. In Turkey, a small protest over plans to destroy one of Istanbul's last remaining parks exploded in size and intensity after a harsh police crackdown shocked the nation. The sight of police spraying giant clouds of tear gas and beating peaceful protesters touched a nerve, inflaming simmering concerns about an increasingly authoritarian regime. In a matter of days, waves of demonstrations, the biggest in decades, spread across the country. Prime Minister Recep Tayip Erdogan, who has not lacked for self-confidence over his 10 years in power, came under sharp criticism over his response to the protests. Has he grown arrogant with power? Having led his party to consecutive victories at the polls, sucking the air out of the powerful military, and overseeing Turkey's rise to new heights of prosperity and international assertiveness, all of a sudden he looked less awe-inspiring. Erdogan may have faced down world leaders, but when he faced his own people he tarnished his image. He is now accused by many at home and abroad of lacking in democratic instincts. The country has new national icons. The newest is the ""Standing Man,"" a protester who steadfastly held his ground amid the chaos, standing for hours gazing at a picture of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. There's the ""woman in red,"" a modernly dressed woman -- symbolizing the secular, world of personal freedom many of the demonstrators seek to defend. A similar image emerged from Brazil. A young woman who appears utterly harmless was sprayed in the face by a policeman dressed in full riot gear. Just like Turkey, no one could have predicted the turn of events in Brazil. A country that has symbolized Latin America's dramatic rise from poverty, where left-leaning governments have combined social programs and market-friendly policies, nearly eradicating extreme poverty, suddenly erupted in a wave of popular fury. The government of President Dilma Rousseff faced the largest protests in 20 years. And it all started over an increase in bus fares. The protests over bus fares touched on worries about a slowdown in the economy, about persistent inequality, corruption and costly projects in preparation for hosting the upcoming World Cup and Olympic Games. Rousseff, a former revolutionary herself, has been taking a much more conciliatory approach than the pugnacious Erdogan. On Wednesday, government officials in San Paulo and Rio de Janeiro announced that they would revoke the hike in bus fares in their cities. In this era of connectivity, a small complaint can explode. Politicians may outmaneuver rival parties during election campaigns. They can claim a majority at the polls -- as Erdogan doesn't tire of remarking he has -- and they can ply their trade on the global stage. But they now have to deal with their citizens' demands in a much more public way. Popular claims have new strength in our age of social media. It's impossible to predict which issue will find flammable material hiding in shared resentments and ignite raging fires of discontent. The water cannons and the tear gas may disperse the first wave of protesters, but a click of a smartphone can produce a photo or video that instantly catches people's attention, potentially attracting even larger protests. The crowd may grow if its concerns are ignored, especially if police repression is violent. One of the challenges for democratic governments is to balance what may be legitimate requirements of public order with a reasonable hearing for reasonable demands. That is the response that separates the tyrants from the democrats. Public space occupations and demonstrations have occurred in nations without democracy. We saw how regimes responded to protests in places like Egypt and Syria. We have seen crackdowns in Russia last year and in Iran after the 2009 elections. These new protests start over smaller issues -- not over tyranny or basic democratic rights. Local issues have a new power to surge with little warning, electrifying the crowds, jolting people out of complacency. Governments can be caught by surprise by what seem like trivial matters -- a small rise in bus fare or saving trees in a park. It wasn't very long ago when every meeting of the powerful nations, of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, brought out angry anti-globalization crowds. Now, the concerns are more immediate, more personal. When President Obama arrived in Northern Ireland on Monday for the meeting of the G8 nations, there were more police officers than protesters. The nature of protest has changed. Governments may have the power to spy on citizens, to read their e-mails and listen to their conversations. But they have largely lost their ability to control the information that is out there. Governments have lost the power to change the subject, to divert attention, to blame a multinational institution or another country for the woes at home. Stories now refuse to die. Protesters, if angered by the government's response, are more likely to persevere. Heads of government cannot control their public image the way they once could. The demigods are dying. New technology may make it easier for governments to learn what the people are thinking, but it makes it harder for them to shape what the people believe. It's a new age. They should consider themselves warned. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: A massive protest can start any time -- just look at Turkey and Brazil .

"(CNN) -- The first statuette of the 70th annual Golden Globe awards went to Christoph Waltz, whose character in ""Django Unchained"" shot two men and a horse in two scenes before I even opened my box of M&M's. But that didn't surprise me, because ""Django,"" a bloody homage to spaghetti Westerns, is a creation of one of my guilty pleasures, director Quentin Tarantino. One of the most important auteurs in cinema today, Tarantino's scripts are intoxicating -- with witty dialogue; surprising and satisfying story arcs, and cartoonish body counts. ""Django"" won him a Golden Globe for screenwriting. And thus the nation's conundrum. A month into our post-Newtown world, ""Django Unchained"" -- a movie that makes mass murder look cool -- has scooped up more than $125 million in three weeks. Is it me, or does it seem odd that a director known for ultra gun violence in his films has the biggest-grossing movie of his career in the wake of the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 20 kids? Not to get all Wayne LaPierre, but wouldn't you think the nation wouldn't have the stomach to see such a glorification of gun violence so close to the tragedy? And yet, here we are: Bruce Willis is slated to ""Die Hard"" again; ""Hansel and Gretel"" has been reimagined into a tale about siblings carrying automatic assault weapons and looking for witches to kill; and 65-year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger is taking on the Mexican cartel, including shooting a Gatling from a school bus. And that's just over the course of a month. Before meeting with Vice President Joe Biden to discuss violence in films and video games, Motion Picture Association of America chairman and former Sen. Chris Dodd told The Hollywood Reporter that the movie industry is vehemently opposed to content regulation, adding ""We have a free and open society that celebrates the First Amendment."" In an NPR interview, Tarantino said it was disrespectful to the victims to bring up violence in movies in relationship to Newtown. ""Obviously, the issue is gun control and mental health,"" he said. I agree. But as we wait for Biden's gun control proposals to be revealed, as well as the ensuing debate in Washington to unfold, it's important to remember this conversation is threefold. Mass shootings -- like those at Newtown, Columbine, the Sikh temple in Wisconsin, and the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater -- and everyday street violence, like what's going on in Chicago, can be addressed immediately by legislation. But background checks and assault rifle bans will not free us from our most debilitating shackle, and that is our numbness, if not addiction, to violence, particularly in film. Of the 100 top-grossing movies of 2012, only three were rated G. Most in the top 10 were PG-13, including ""The Hunger Games,"" a film about kids brutally killing each other for sport; two were PG and one was R. This is why, when celebrities came together to film an anti-gun public service announcement, they were immediately called out as hypocrites, and rightfully so. In one scene in the Tarantino movie Jamie Foxx, who plays the main character, Django, shoots a man carrying sticks of dynamite, and the guy is literally blown into pieces. And Foxx is the first person you see in an anti-gun ad? Please. It's hard enough to find the right balance between the freedoms guaranteed to us by the Constitution and living in a gun-happy Wild West, without cries for control coming from an industry that continues to glorify the lack of control. For those of us who feel comfortable calling out the NRA crowd for hiding behind the Second Amendment, consider the actions of the Hollywood crowd, which hides behind the First Amendment in its manipulative glorification of gun violence. Or consider the actions of We the People, who year in and year out spend billions to watch someone wielding an Auto-Assault 12 shotgun, which spits out 300 rounds a minute, mow down people on the big screen. I don't believe the government should pressure Hollywood to make less violent movies. The industry is only giving us what we want to see. Even now, just four short weeks after 20 children and six adults were massacred in Newtown, we still crave gun violence and death by chainsaw. The White House and Congress can address mass shootings and violent crimes, but the culture of violence isn't about Biden, Foxx or Tarantino. It's about us.

"(CNN) -- While there is still a lot of talk about how the Republican Party needs to reinvent itself, Democrats should keep in mind they could use a touch-up themselves. With 20 Senate seats to defend in the midterm election -- compared with just 13 Republican ones -- the truth is Sen. Harry Reid and the gang do not have a lot of time to gloat. The economy may be improving, but it is still limping; millions are looking for work, and the deficit continues to grow. So whatever momentum President Obama and the Democrats received from last week's victories will all be gone come 2016 if they can't agree on a detailed budget plan by 2014. And let's be clear: Taxing the rich and closing some loopholes is not a detailed plan. Granted, Democrats are proposing spending cuts -- but they have to be more bullish about their proposed cuts than they are about taxing the rich. The latter got them elected but the economy is in more need of the former. Allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire for those who make $1 million a year or more, as championed by some, is estimated to generate only $500 billion to $600 billion over 10 years. That dwarfs the number cutting off Big Bird would bring but it does little to solve the debt problem. Opinion: Conservatives, don't despair . So any plan that does not include significant spending cuts is no plan at all. If Democrats want to build on last week, they have to be bold, because they can't depend on Republicans to say stupid things about rape or ignore minorities forever. In fact, confetti was still falling in Chicago when George P. Bush -- the Spanish speaking, half-Mexican nephew of you know who -- filed his papers with the Texas Ethics Commission to run for an as-yet unspecified office. The 36-year-old is the co-founder of the political action committee, Hispanic Republicans of Texas. That alone won't solve all of the party's image problems with Latinos, but as long as he's not on the crazy, inflammatory side of his party, he's got the looks, charisma and name to be the kind of political star they need -- the kind who can draw big crowds and maybe sway Latino voters two years from now, if not for himself, then certainly for another GOP candidate. Face it Democrats -- the celebration is over and it's time to get to work. At least six of the Senate seats the party has to defend are in red states. Lose those, and President Obama could be spending his final two years butting heads with a Republican Congress. So what do the Democrats need to do? Opinion: Election a call for purple politics . Well for starters, identify candidates to go after Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins' seat, because Obama won Maine. Second, be a party white people want to vote for. Lost in all of the hoopla about Republicans needing to adapt to the country's new demographic, is the fact Romney captured the largest percentage of white votes since Ronald Reagan. True, some of that can be attributed to racist backlash to Obama -- but most of it has to do with the message of the Democratic platform. Romney characterized 47% of the country as a bunch of moochers (and coincidentally came away with 47.8% of the popular vote). That means a lot of voters: the numbers suggest 88% of the people who voted for Romney were white. That's a problem. If Democrats don't figure out a way to make their message attractive to white people, they could possibly lose the Senate. And third, and probably most important, they have to be a party worth voting for. One can certainly say Republicans, from the top of the ticket on down, shot themselves in the foot this election, making it easier for Democrats to paint them as a party to vote against. But for the 2014 midterm, Democrats must present a budget plan people want to vote for. In two years voters are going to be asking ""What else you got?"" and if Democrats don't have an answer, they risk getting shellacked in 2014, the same way they got their butts handed to them in 2010. Back then, Republicans took back the House. Politics: 2014 battle for the Senate starts now . Another GOP landslide could create a path to the White House.

"(CNN) -- If I had a nickel each time a white guy e-mails or tweets that I have my job because I'm black, I wouldn't need the job, because I'd be rich. This is at the heart of a little talked about secret regarding affirmative action: A lot of black professionals don't like it either. Not because they think the playing field is necessarily leveled, but rather their skills and talents are constantly being slighted by whites who think their jobs were given to them solely because of their race. It's insulting, it's demeaning and there's not a damn thing we can do about it, because as long as race is part of the qualification metric, the perception that the bar was lowered so that we could jump over it will persist. There are voters who think President Obama's success came easy because of affirmative action, overlooking the fact he's brilliant and oh, by the way, he and the first lady were still paying off their student loans 10 years ago. I can tell you from experience, there is nothing ""easy"" about paying back student loans. Yes, there is an inherent hypocrisy of having such a policy in a post civil-rights world. But it is cynical to think we're a post-racial society just because we have a black president. Should affirmative action still exist? That's not to characterize all that befalls blacks and other minorities as ""the man"" holding us down, but rather recognizing a freight train doesn't stop the instant the brakes are applied. Racial inequality had been moving full steam ahead for centuries in this country, starting with the attempted genocide of Native Americans. So while our present-day attitudes about race are changed, the byproducts stemming from our past attitudes -- like access to a quality education and the impact of generational poverty -- are still very much at play. Opinion: Keep affirmative action but reform it . Talking about this and other topics related to race doesn't make one a racist. But denying its relevance in everyday life has the potential to hurt everyone. For example, the Florida State Board of Education has recently come under fire because the academic achievement goals it set for minority students appear to be lower than the ones set for white students. By the 2017-18 school year, the board wants to have 88% of white students at or above the grade level benchmark for reading but only 81% of Latinos and 74% of blacks. The reason: the disparity in the current reading level. While 69% of whites reach that mark now, only 53% of Latinos and just 38% of blacks do. That's a problem, not only in terms of students' ability to get into college, but just having a workforce in the state that is literate. So though the percentages of the 2017-18 goals seem biased in favor of whites, the percentage increase seeks to aggressively address a major reading problem plaguing minorities. This isn't racist. This is recognizing that if this racial disparity goes unchecked, it could have debilitating long-term effects on Florida's economy. Some think the word diversity is a euphemism for ""anything but white,"" but I don't. I believe in the diversity of thought, which sometimes can play out racially, but not always. Having people from different geographic locations can introduce different insight and talent to a college campus or workforce, and variations of socioeconomic status bring in diversity as well. But don't be mistaken, race is important. One of the elements of the infamous ""47%"" video that didn't get talked about a lot was Mitt Romney's joke that if he had Mexican heritage, he'd have ""a better shot"" at winning the election. That joke was followed by a comment from someone in the crowd who suggested Romney could claim to have some Native American heritage like Elizabeth Warren, to get a leg up. In what socioeconomic metric is there a quantifiable advantage to being Mexican or Native American in this country? The outcry about the push for diversity in the workplace and in college admissions would lead you to believe we're overcompensating for the sins of the past. But look around: Does it really look as if the populations with the highest poverty rate -- blacks, Latinos and Native Americans -- are just cleaning up in the game of life? 5 things to know about affirmative action . True, there are certainly examples of unqualified or incompetent employees being placed in positions they shouldn't be because of flawed decision making from white superiors trying to be compliant with their HR department. However, that's not what affirmative action was designed to do. Take my profession, for example. According to an American Society of News Editors study, minorities make up 12.3% of newspaper staffs and 16.4% of online-only news staffs despite being a third of the general population. Similarly the National Association of Black Journalists released a study last month that found minorities filled 12% of the newsroom managerial positions at 295 stations owned by 19 media conglomerates. So I ask you, if the so-called liberal media struggles to employ diversity that's representative of the people -- and it has affirmative action policies in place -- what makes us think completely removing such initiatives is going to improve the situation? I do not like affirmative action in its current incarnation, and I think a lot of us can agree the flaws need to be addressed. But in this conversation, let's not pretend the reasons why it was created in the first place are no longer around. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: A lot of black professionals -- like me -- don't like affirmative action .

"(CNN) -- The first ""cup"" was used in hockey in 1874 and the first helmet was used in 1974. That means it only took 100 years for men to realize that their brain is also important. That joke's been circulating on the Internet for years. And while it is funny, it's also an embarrassing observation about our past carelessness. But before we start congratulating ourselves about how ""advanced"" we are now, we should make note of this one little factoid: For much of the country, high school football practice started last month, and for much of the country, high school classes start next month. Given where our high schoolers rank globally in reading, math and science, that is essentially putting the cup before the helmet in the 21st century. Here again are the numbers: 14th out of 34 nations in reading, 17th in science and 25th in math, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Again -- 25th in math. No wonder we keep saying we're No. 1; there's a chance many of us can't count much higher than that. Opinion: After Mars landing, is science cool again? I don't enjoy writing about how dumb our kids are. But the truth is we live locally and are competing for jobs globally. Once upon a time, our high school students could skate by and still secure a good paying job later. That's simply isn't the case today. Part of the reason why the unemployment rate is 8.3% is because many Americans don't have the technical skills necessary to fill some of the 3.5 million jobs that are available. And that's not me shooting from the hip or apologizing for President Barack Obama's economic policies. John Engler, a former Republican Michigan governor and president of Business Roundtable, wrote in a June op-ed for U.S. News & World Report that ""even with more than 13 million Americans unemployed, the manufacturing sector cannot find people with the skills to take nearly 600,000 unfilled jobs, according to a study last fall by the Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte."" Jeff Weiner, CEO of Linkedin, a networking website with millions of resumes on its database, recently said that ""at least one major driving factor (for the 3.5 million unfulfilled jobs) here is ... the pace with which technology and innovation is now accelerating. We are outstripping our ability to educate and train the existing work force."" The first step Weiner prescribed to correct this problem: fixing our education system. And by fixing, I would start with our dogmatism. Studies as far back as 1906 have indicated that over summer vacation children forget significant portions of what they learned during the school year, and yet we keep using the same academic calendar that was instituted in the 19th century -- before schools were air-conditioned or teachers certified. That would be like us using leeches to cure diseases -- something else we used to do in the 19th century. And high school sports starting before high school classes literally screams misplaced priorities. Many parents as well as students are against year-round school, noting the lessons that can be learned during summer vacation. I'm fine with that rationale, but why can't the first sign of fall be classrooms opening instead of team practices? My son's first track meet is in less than two weeks away. His first day of school is after Labor Day. Something just seems wrong about that, especially in Michigan where 48% of the state's school districts did not make, what the U.S. Department of Education calls, ""adequate yearly progress."" Even worse, more than 82% of the state's students did not meet the ACT benchmark for college readiness. But hey, who's ready for some football?

"(CNN) -- Over the past few days we've heard a lot of criticism directed at the National Football League after the arrest of a Dallas Cowboy player on an intoxication manslaughter charge. And justifiably so: A 25-year-old father-to-be who was riding in the player's car is dead. But we can't fall into the trap of making this conversation all about the NFL or even professional athletes. Doing that is a cop-out. Legendary country singer Randy Travis was arrested this year on a driving while intoxicated charge. South Carolina state Rep. Ted Vick was arrested this year on a charge of drunken driving. Florida's Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said Joshua Postorino, a Georgia Tech assistant basketball coach, was ""swerving all over the road"" before being arrested last week on a driving under the influence charge. We can try to make this conversation about NFL players -- but of the nearly 2,000 men who suit up per season, 14 DUI arrests are made, according to USA Today. That equates to a .7% percent rate. The rate for men in the general population ages 20 to 29, the age bracket of most NFL players, is twice that. Meanwhile, men 21 to 34 are responsible for 42% of all DUI deaths. Read more: Dallas Cowboys players involved in fatal crash were 'like brothers' This issue isn't about football players. The MetLife Stadium doesn't stop serving alcohol at the beginning of the third quarter because officials are afraid the players are going to try to drive home drunk. If we want to use this tragedy in Dallas to talk about DUIs, then perhaps we need to be more focused on the men who watch the games, not play them. The stats suggest the average guy probably doesn't need to go the full six degrees of separation before finding a connection with another guy who got behind the wheel of a car when he shouldn't have. When I look back at my 20s, I know I've been lucky more than once, and I thank God that his grace covered me when my pride put me -- and others -- in harm's way. Too proud to say I've had too much to drink because men are supposed to be able to handle our liquor. Too proud to say I need a ride home, because that would be asking for help -- and men don't like to do that. Too proud to admit I might've been out of control, even though being out of control is the main side effect of excessive drinking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says men are much more likely than women to drink excessively and drive at high speeds. Men average about 12.5 binge drinking episodes a year; Women average 2.7. And yet we want to make this entire conversation about sports, when this is no more a sports story than a rerun of ""Sex and the City."" Last year Alan Hale, a state representative and bar owner from Montana, got on the House floor and advocated for a repeal of all DUI laws because they hurt small businesses and ""they're destroying a way of life."" FYI: There is no professional sports team in Montana. Our culture promotes a casual attitude about intoxication -- from ""The Hangover"" to Jamie Foxx's Grammy-winning ""Blame It"" -- and then gets all pious when something bad happens because of alcohol. If we want to have a grownup conversation about DUIs, that's where it should start: Otherwise we're just sucking up oxygen. Does this mean the NFL should ignore drunken driving arrests of its players? Of course not. But the CDC says adults got behind the wheel drunk an estimated 112 million times in 2010 -- nearly 300,000 times a day -- and that 81% of all drunken drivers are men. So whatever thoughts we may be harboring about athletes who drink and drive, it would be wise to extend those feelings far beyond the realm of sports. Nearly 11,000 people are killed each year because of alcohol-impaired driving. But since 1998, there have only been three NFL players who have been suspected of having killed someone because of driving drunk. You can do the rest of the math from there. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: NFL slammed after player's arrest on intoxication manslaughter charge .

"(CNN) -- This morning, I decided to wear jeans. I could've gone with sweat pants, but I needed to stop by a couple of offices and didn't want to look too relaxed. I could've done slacks but didn't want to look too uptight. I'm not big into khakis, and it's too chilly for shorts, so jeans won out. I decided to go with the French Roast over the Morning Blend. When I got in my Jeep, I decided to listen to Eric Church as opposed to Zac Brown Band or Craig Morgan. I opted not to run that red light. I chose to park on the street as opposed to the nearby lot. And just before I got out of the car, I chose to be gay. I was going to make that decision earlier, but you know how hectic mornings can be. I'm just glad I remembered when I did. I've been known to go all day without remembering to pick a sexual orientation, which can make things pretty awkward at home. Now, if that last part sounds a bit stupid to you, welcome to my world. The idea that people can just pick their sexual orientation the way they pick what to wear or what kind of coffee to drink is so irrational that even conservative vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan had a problem going along with that line of thinking. In 2007, he voted to support the Employee Non-Discrimination Act, saying, ""They (his gay friends) didn't roll out of bed one morning and choose to be gay. That's who they are."" His words from back then echo the words of Dr. Mirta Roses Periago, the director of the Pan American Health Organization, who said this year, ""Since homosexuality is not a disorder or a disease, it does not require a cure."" It's been more than 20 years since the World Health Assembly removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders. Which is why the news out of California this week should not be that Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that prohibits minors from being subjected to treatment from state-licensed therapists designed to change their sexual orientation. The story is that this practice is still going on in 2012. ""This bill bans non-scientific 'therapies' that have driven young people to depression and suicide,'' Brown said in a statement. ""These practices have no basis in science or medicine and they will now be relegated to the dustbin of quackery."" News: California governor signs gay conversion therapy ban . And trying to change children from gay to straight is indeed quackery -- so say the people who study quackery for a living. ""The longstanding consensus of the behavioral and social sciences and the health and mental health professions is that homosexuality per se is a normal and positive variation of human sexual orientation,"" the American Psychiatric Association says, adding that the potential risks of so-called ""reparative therapy"" include depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior. Of course, there will always be people who refuse to let facts get in the way of their prejudice, and some of those folks are a bit upset by Brown's actions -- particularly members of the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality. News: Therapist to challenge 'gay cure' ban . On its website, the group said it ""is saddened but not surprised by this unprecedented legislative intrusion and will lend its full support to the legal efforts to overturn it."" Keep in mind, the association's website has featured ""reparative therapy"" studies conducted by George Rekers, a former board member who resigned after he paid a male escort to accompany him on a 10-day European vacation and allegedly give him nude massages. (Rekers denies any sexual behavior in the incident.) That's not mentioned on the website. Anyway, there is also a rigorous defense there of the infamous 2001 ""reparative therapy"" study conducted by Dr. Robert Spitzer. Back then, Spitzer suggested that highly motivated gay people could change their orientation. Since then, Spitzer himself said he was wrong and went so far as to issue a statement that read in part: . ""I believe I owe the gay community an apology for my study making unproven claims of the efficacy of reparative therapy. I also apologize to any gay person who wasted time and energy undergoing some form of reparative therapy because they believed that I had proven that reparative therapy works with some 'highly motivated' individuals."" The doctor who conducted the study denounces the findings. And yet quackery is still trying to hold on to the notion that just as people can choose French Roast over Morning Blend, they can choose to be straight over gay. In a recent CNN interview, conservative televangelist Joel Osteen -- who says that being gay is a sin -- also said, ""I know I have not chosen to be straight. It just feels like that's who I am."" But when he was asked how, then, could a gay person choose to be gay, if he didn't choose to be straight, well -- ""I don't understand all of those issues, and so, you know, I try to stick on the issues that I do understand.""

"(CNN) -- Over the past couple of weeks, I have been asking random people who identify as Republicans if they trust Mitt Romney, and each of them gave me an answer like this -- ""I trust him more than I trust Obama."" It's just a long winded way of saying ""no."" They said they did want to see his taxes. They said they have reservations about a major tax plan lacking specifics. Some said they saw the video of him describing himself as a pro-abortion rights moderate; others knew that in the hardcover version of his book ""No Apology,"" he expressed pride in Romneycare and believed that ""we can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country."" They know he flip flops. Misspeaks. Lies. And yet, their dislike of President Barack Obama is so strong that they're willing to overlook that whole character thing and swallow the bitter pill that is Romney. How can they do that, you say? Well for starters, Obama isn't exactly a rock of Gibraltar himself. Politifact's ""Obameter"" has been keeping track of the more than 500 promises the president made during the 2008 campaign and found thus far he's kept 37% of them. He's broken 16%, compromised on 14% and is still working on another 22%. So even though Romney smells, Obama's not exactly lilacs. He promised to address gun control. He hasn't. He promised to close Gitmo. It's still open. Obama was for gay marriage, then he was against it, and now he's for it again. If you believe his evolution wasn't about politics, then you probably believe Jimmy Carter was robbed in 1980. This is why some Republicans are willing to vote for a guy they may not trust: He's viewed as the lesser of two evils. But pointing out the evils in the other party does nothing to address the evils in their own. Here's the thing: The question of trusting Mitt Romney has nothing to do with Barack Obama. It's about Romney. Voters might not like to think about that too much, but they need to look beyond campaign sleight of hand to give it some serious thought because the future of the middle class depends on it. This week, both Romney and VP hopeful Paul Ryan have been touting a multitrillion dollar tax-cutting plan with no details, essentially asking voters to take it on faith that it'll all work out. Many conservative pundits, including George Will, say Romney's math -- where it exists -- is a bit fuzzy and all Romney can say is ""trust me."" So again, I ask Republicans: Do you? Not in comparison to Obama, but in comparison to your understanding of the word trust. Knowing what you know -- and don't know. Because if he wins, saying ""I trust him more than I trust Obama"" is not going to help matters in January. It's not going to protect the middle class' ability to write off the interest on their mortgages or deduct charitable giving. Romney said the plan won't touch those deductions, but he won't tell us which deductions it will touch. Trust him with our taxes, he says. And yet, he won't trust us to even look at his. At the Republican National Convention, Mitt's wife, Ann, painted a picture of their early years together as if the two of them were barely getting by. And then an old Boston Globe interview surfaced in which she said ""we were happy, studying hard. Neither one of us had a job, because Mitt had enough of an investment from stock that we could sell off a little at a time."" Realizing that struggling college students work and don't usually live off investments, she backed away from her earlier characterization, telling ""Meet the Press"" later that, ""Mitt and I do recognize that we have not had a financial struggle in our lives."" Uhm ... you do know that she didn't just realize this, right? You do know that her speech was designed to manipulate voters in an attempt to paint her husband as a regular Joe, a guy just like them, someone they could trust. So ... do you? Do you trust Mitt Romney? Obama has only kept 37% of his promises. But Politifact's GOP Pledge-O-Meter, which they describe as having followed ""dozens of promises made in 2010 by Republican leaders"" and in their Pledge to America, found that the GOP has only kept 19% of its promises. If you can't trust a guy who has only kept 37% of his promises, how do you trust leaders that have only kept 19% of theirs? Better yet, how do you trust a guy, who as governor of Massachusetts, signed an assault weapon ban in 2004, reiterated his support for a ban in 2007 and then shows up at an NRA convention in 2012 talking like some sort of John Wayne wannabe?

"(CNN) -- There was a time, not very long ago, when it seemed as if each of the world's major problems and every potential solution pivoted around the United States. The president of the United States was referred to as the leader of the free world, and the term was not used with irony or mockery. No one today would, or should, use that musty old expression, which dates back to the Cold War. For one thing, it's not even clear precisely what the free world is. Still, it's worth pondering whether if in the next election, American voters will crown the most powerful man in the world, the man who will lead the world's democracies and inspire those who aspire to freedom. In short: Does America, and the American president, still matter that much to the rest of the planet? I spent much of the time leading up to the last two presidential elections traveling overseas. Back then, conversations with non-Americans revealed anxiety about the elections, which would result in consecutive terms for George W. Bush. More than once I heard the comment that the whole world should be allowed to vote in the U.S. election, because the outcome would affect people's lives everywhere. For many decades, the security of Europe depended on Washington's protection, and the world economy rose and fell on the fate of America's economic growth. Today, America seems little more than a bystander on many of the top global issues. The European economic crisis does not hinge on U.S. actions. Developing economies worry more about Chinese than American growth. Those who believed peace between Arabs and Israelis depends on the United States are no longer so convinced. The Arab uprisings, revolutions and civil wars have seen some U.S. involvement -- most notably in Libya -- but they have largely unfolded on their own stage, with America sitting in the audience, at times cheering, criticizing or just offering an opinion. Opinion: What matters to women in the election . It would be easy to conclude that America's presidential election this time around is a matter of concern only to Americans. But that would be wrong. The world remains enthralled with American politics. No other election on the planet receives a similar amount of attention. Not even close. I have just returned from another couple of rounds abroad and still I see enormous interest in U.S. politics. Headlines everywhere follow the minutiae of the protracted U.S. presidential election. From Latin America to Asia, people heard about Republican candidates Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich. They are intrigued that Mitt Romney is a Mormon, and they have heard about issues of U.S. health care and American troops in Afghanistan. Still, the sense that the U.S. election will have a direct and immediate impact on everyone's life seems to have receded compared to the days of the Iraq war. Opinion: Romney's absurd idea on indicting Ahmadinejad . People with Internet connections for the first time had the opportunity to watch the presidential debates. According to YouTube, millions watched live, at all hours of the day and night, in 215 countries and territories. One poll, conducted by Gallup in 30 countries, interviewing 26,000 people, found 42% say they wish they could vote in the U.S. election. The number is even greater for young people, which shows it's not just Cold War nostalgia at work in the emotional connection to the United States. Nearly two-thirds of those asked said a U.S. president has a great impact on life in their own countries. Over the years, many people have resented American influence and power. When the Soviet Union collapsed and the competition between the two superpowers left only one standing, the French, in particular, derided America as the ""Hyperpower."" Resentment of U.S. power will never die in some quarters, but the polls show a majority of Europeans consider American leadership in world affairs ""desirable."" When the president of France started pushing for Western intervention to prevent civilian massacres in Libya, it took American power to make it happen. With tragic symmetry, the massacres have continued in Syria as Washington decided not to intervene. Bergen: Romney endorses Obama's national security policy . The world watches America's top politicians. It gets to know them, and everyone has an opinion. A number of polls show Barack Obama is the overwhelming favorite to win this election; that's among non-Americans. The Gallup Global Poll found Obama ahead by 81% to 19%. Another poll commissioned by the BBC and conducted in 21 countries showed Obama ahead 50% to 21%. The president was ahead everywhere except in Pakistan, where Romney edged ahead, but neither candidate was liked by even 20% of those questioned. Obama was enormously popular in Europe, Australia, Canada, Nigeria, Kenya, Panama, Brazil and other countries. It's also not as if the world started paying attention only as the elections approached. Pollsters have been taking the temperature of global opinion all along. Obama came to office with enormous support at home and abroad. As his popularity numbers started coming down to earth in the United States, they did the same in other countries. Early this year, the international consensus was against Obama. Just 46% wanted him re-elected, according to Gallup's March poll. His approval rating collapsed, particularly in Arab countries, scraping the bottom in Egypt at just 19%. As the alternative emerged, views changed. Now that they see it's Obama or Romney, the world says give us Obama. I'll leave the explanation of that reaction for another day. The United States has undoubtedly lost a great deal of the influence it once had. It doesn't always have the ability or the inclination to shape events. Power is more widely divided, but still today nobody has more of it. And that power is not just measured in money or guns. It is still measured in ideas and values. That's why polls show so many people still look to the United States and say they want America to hold on to its position of global leadership. The entire world is paying attention to the American election, because the president of the United States, whoever he (yes, still he) is, remains the most powerful and influential human being on Earth. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: President once considered leader of free world, a key influence in world .

"(CNN) -- Mississippi may be the fattest state in the country. And it may be among the least educated and have provided the backdrop to some of the country's most heinous displays of racism. And you can dismiss its lawmakers as just a bunch of dumb, backwoods hicks if you think that makes for good humor in other parts of the country. But then consider this: It's possible its legislature has cannily unlocked a way to make abortion illegal without having to overturn Roe v. Wade. The state has instituted a series of unreasonable regulations for doctors who perform abortions. Using a practice very similar to the kind of bottlenecking that was done to suppress black votes during the Jim Crow era, Mississippi has systematically squeezed the number of abortion clinics in the state down to just one. And if a federal court ultimately finds its new regulations constitutional, that one will be gone too. (Wednesday, a federal judge extended his temporary order to let the clinic stay open). In other words, Mississippi, the dumb little state that supposedly couldn't, will effectively become the leader in what some call a regressive movement --though a recent Gallup poll suggests it's not as out-of-touch as they may think. Fifty percent of Americans identify as pro-life and from 1995 to 2010, some 600 abortion-related laws have passed on the state level. And it would seem the anti-abortion movement is picking up steam. Within the first six months of 2011, 162 new anti-abortion provisions were implemented around the country. For those keeping score, that also coincides with the rise of the tea party movement. Coincidence? Maybe. But when one looks at that astounding spike in the numbers running in tandem with the tea party-led attack on Planned Parenthood that strangled the debt ceiling debate, the likelihood that it's all just one big coin-ki-dink is a tough sell. And keep in mind that Mississippi, arguably the most conservative state in the country, is not some outlier. A fifth of the nation wants all abortions to be illegal. Only 41% view themselves as pro-choice, while 52% believe abortion should only be legal under certain circumstances, such as rape. America continues to struggle with this issue; it's small wonder that Mississippi is able to exploit this. My own view lies somewhere in the middle: I'm against abortion ... so I refuse to have one. Seeing how I've never had an unwanted or life-threatening pregnancy, I don't feel equipped to tell complete strangers in those circumstances what they should do with their bodies. I'd argue that this view is no more absurd than watching four GOP presidential candidates debate the topic of abortion last winter with not one of them using the word ""woman"" in any form. It is also absurd that a female, Democratic lawmaker in Michigan was barred from speaking in the Republican controlled House because that body felt using the word ""vagina"" in a debate about abortion violated decorum. What's also absurd? That liberals continue to think they can change the national dialogue about this topic and other controversial issues simply by making fun of stereotypical people from the South. Earlier this year, Nancy Pelosi's filmmaker daughter, Alexandra, conducted a round of interviews there for HBO's ""Real Time."" Some of the comments she came back with, such as that Barack Obama was a ""half-breed,"" were indeed ignorant and did not surprise me at all. But dismissing Mississippi in this abortion debate misses the magnitude of the decision that could end up prevailing. This isn't just about the 20th state in the Union. If the judge eventually lifts the injunction to the law, it may present the blueprint that conservative lawmakers use in the other 49 in an effort to outlaw all abortions. For decades, liberals and conservatives have been fighting to find the answer to this great riddle: Whose rights should take precedence -- the mother's or that of the unborn child she is carrying? What Mississippi lawmakers have done is said to hell with the answer, and instead opted to eliminate the riddle all together. You can call it a war on women, you can call it misogyny run amok, you can call it covert theocracy; it doesn't really matter. The end result is this: Reproductive health is about to get a face-lift, whether it wants one or not. Because even if the Mississippi law is ruled unconstitutional (in 1992 the Supreme Court said no state shall impose laws that places undue burden on women seeking an abortion), that won't stop copycats in other parts of the country from massaging what the state did in hopes of creating a law that will hold up in the books. Not bad for a state that's routinely made into a punch line. If the court rules in its favor, I guess we'll know who has the last laugh.

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- President Obama appeared at two recent fundraisers with some serious sticker shock. About 200 people ponied up at least $5,000 per ticket for an event hosted by Ricky Martin. That was followed by a function at a private home where 60 people spent $38,500 each to get through the door. Just last week, Obama -- with George Clooney -- raised $15 million in one night. This makes me wonder how in the hell our political process became so distorted that Obama needs this much money to run for re-election. I thought we were broke? And yet, at the end of March, Obama and his presumed general election opponent, Mitt Romney, had raised nearly a combined $300 million, almost enough to fund Planned Parenthood's annual budget by themselves. Forget Wall Street, it's the campaign trail that needs to be occupied. The median income in the United States is about $50,000, so I doubt very many 99 percenters are able to meet the $75,000 minimum that was expected at a recent Romney fundraiser. Did you know the goal of the RNC is to raise $800 million by November? Imagine how many families could be helped if just half of that was used to train people for the new job market, as opposed to being spent to help one guy get hired? Face it, the president and Romney may have different political and economic views, but they are both propped up by highly affluent power brokers who are expecting big returns for the big checks they are writing. This is why the worst thing to happen to our process was the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which allows corporations (and unions) to spend unlimited funds to promote a candidate. This is akin to handing the keys of a bakery to the Cookie Monster. These big spenders are not just involved in shaping dialogue. They get involved with shaping policy, which inevitably makes the good of the people secondary to the good of the deepest pockets. We don't just need campaign reform, we need roadblocks to prevent special interest groups from turning the democratic process into more of a sham that it already is. Let the Supreme Court keep its ridiculous ruling, but set a limit on the amount of money candidates can raise and spend on their campaigns. Require all ads and debates to be aired on public television, and then cap the number of hours each party is allowed to use during the general election. By putting it on public television, we stop large media conglomerates from profiting from the process. So, ideally Obama and Romney would both get $10 million and 40 hours of advertisement to state their case. Let's take away the $200 million war chests that Obama has been able to amass in both 2008 and 2012, and force him and future candidates to find a way to persuade the country to vote for them without relying on their ability to outspend their opponent. I know, I know, Romney wouldn't even be in the position he's in without outspending -- and dare I say, bullying -- his opponents. By leveling the economic playing field, our politicians have a chance to return to being representatives of the people, not just the ones who know the right people or make the right promises. Before making the rounds in New York on Monday, President Obama tweeted a sentence from the commencement speech he gave at Barnard College: ""Don't just get involved. Fight for your seat at the table. Better yet, fight for your seat at the head of the table."" He left out the part about needing $5,000 to get in the door so you can even see the table. But I guess those messy details are easy to overlook in a country with an 8.1% unemployment rate, whose leaders still find it appropriate to hold fundraisers for rich people.

"(CNN) -- Not since that cranky old lady asked ""where's the beef?"" has a fast food chain had an ad as funny as the Chick-fil-A cows begging people to ""Eat Mor Chikin."" And when I moved to Atlanta, where the franchise company is based, I did. Then I found out the company was funneling portions of its proceeds to fight gay rights. Now I'm back to eating chicken, and not chikin. This is the U. S. Constitution at work -- freedom of speech meets freedom of expression. Chicago's mayor Rahm Emanuel, Boston's Thomas Menino and a handful of other mayors threatening to ban Chick-fil-A because of anti-gay marriage remarks made by its president, Dan Cathy? Not so much. Are you demonstrating at Chick-fil-A this week? Such a position may sound noble. It may be coming from a good place in the officials' hearts. But thankfully it is unconstitutional. The last thing anyone, liberal or conservative, should want is local government censoring what a private citizen can say by way of withholding permits and licenses. With the exception of a few examples, such as falsely yelling fire in a crowded space, freedom of speech isn't contingent upon what a person says. So members of the Ku Klux Klan can legally rally and spew hate about black people. Westboro Baptist Church can protest and say terrible things about a soldier during his funeral. And Cathy can say whatever he wants about gay people. That's the U.S. Constitution at work. You know what else is constitutional? Rahm and Thomas making out with each other in protest. In response to Cathy's remarks -- and the fact Chick-Fil-A has donated millions to organizations that fight gay rights -- the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation is organizing a same-sex kiss-in to be held at Chick-fil-A restaurants across the country Friday. I'm not sure if Rahm and the others are free that day, but unlike their talk of banning the franchise, their participation in the lip lock is totally legal. It's an unconventional protest for sure, one that lends itself to great video, funny interviews and front page stories with women kissing and the word ""chicks"" somewhere in the headline. If you're thinking of joining in, may I suggest making out before eating a chikin sandwich. Kiss-ins are so much more enjoyable when protesters have fresh breath. Opinion: Chick-fil-A and free speech . Perhaps more entertaining than the kisses will be seeing how Chick's management handles the situation. Having the CEO ramble on about gay people bringing God's wrath down upon the nation is a PR nightmare, but it's manageable. Video of staff kicking people out of its restaurants for being gay -- and let's face it, if straight people are kissing and get to stay, that's exactly what it will be -- well, that just opens the franchise up for a more significant financial backlash. Boycotts, like freedom of speech, are constitutional. Perhaps sensing that could be the next step in this debacle, the company recently issued a statement on its Facebook page that read in part, ""The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect --- regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender."" This echoes remarks made by Cathy last year when he was asked about the company's donations to anti-gay groups. Back then he said ""We're not anti-anybody. Our mission is to create raving fans."" Well, he's got people raving, but I don't think this is what he had in mind. Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl said he ""could not agree more with the mayors in terms of their positions, and I couldn't disagree more with Chick-fil-A and their position, and if it's appropriate for us to take a hard stand and say, 'You're not welcomed,' we'll consider it."" Again, that's not necessarily the Constitution at work, but it does sound like another pair of high-profile lips are eligible for Friday's kiss-in. To be fair, Cathy does have a lot of supporters who are choosing to eat mor chikin. My Take: Chick-fil-A controversy reveals religious liberty under threat . Rick Santorum recently live tweeted during a Chick-fil-A visit, Sarah Palin was photographed this weekend with a bag of chikin and Mike Huckabee declared this upcoming Wednesday as ""Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day."" This is what the forefathers had in mind when they composed the Constitution: liberals making out during lunch and conservatives stuffing their face with chikin in the name of Jesus. God, I love this country. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: I was a Chick-fil-A fan until I heard of its stance on gay rights .

"(CNN) -- For the better part of four years, voters have said the No. 1 issue is the economy. For the past year, the economy has been the GOP's primary point of attack against President Obama. For months, the economy and job creation has been Mitt Romney's calling card. So now that the president has stepped out and voiced support for marriage equality, we're going to see if the economy and jobs remain the top issue or if the direction of this election has been permanently altered by Obama's historic remarks. Remember, Republicans characterized the war on women as a Democratic strategy to divert attention from the ""real issue"" of the economy. Over the next couple of days, we'll see if the GOP will be as dismissive with gay rights. Or will the fact that in 2004, George W. Bush successfully used discrimination against the gay-lesbian-bisexual-transgender (GLBT) community to motivate his base be too juicy a strategy for Romney and the gang to pass up? Keep in mind that a CNN/ORC International poll taken in late March showed gay rights was tied for dead last in what voters felt was the most important issue, so if the GOP does try to use Obama's remarks as weapons against him, there is a good chance the rhetoric will fall on deaf ears. Perhaps Romney said it best himself, during a big primary night victory speech in April: ""It's still about the economy and we're not stupid."" But it's Romney speaking, and he's never been married to any position for very long -- pun intended. In 1994, when he referred to himself as a moderate, Romney told the Log Cabin Republicans -- a GLBT organization -- that he'd be better than Sen. Ted Kennedy on gay rights. Wednesday, he reiterated his views in his latest incarnation as a conservative by saying that he's against marriage equality and civil unions. So whether or not Romney actually stays focused on the economy is anyone's guess. This probably explains why Obama holds double-digit leads over Romney on likeability, honesty, confidence, values and leadership -- and that was before Obama's courageous interview with Robin Roberts on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" Even in the one area where on paper Romney has significant credibility -- the economy -- 44% of voters believe the president will do a better job, while 42% prefer Romney, according to a CNN poll. If Romney can't get any more traction from his calling card, nor a boost from his vice presidental selection, there is the possibility the economy will take a backseat to gay rights in his campaign. Assuming of course, it hasn't already. I guess we'll have to wait and see what kind of ads begin to emerge and what he says on the trail once the initial dust has settled. But what is clear is that President Obama is no coward. Critics can question the timing of his remarks but the reality is, he didn't have to state his support for marriage equality before the election. Even with reporters dogging him at every news conference because of the remarks on same-sex marriage made by Vice President Joe Biden over the weekend, all Obama had to say was ""I'm getting there"" and we would've moved on. But in embracing a view most assumed he had anyway, Obama places his core convictions ahead of political expediency. That's very rare to see in an election year. What he did took a great deal of courage, especially considering that a recent Gallup poll showed 48% of Americans are against same-sex marriages and that North Carolina, a swing state he barely won four years ago, just voted against marriage equality and civil unions, with a vote of 61% to 39%. But because of that, Obama further separates himself from his opponent -- whose biggest weakness has been his perceived lack of conviction about matters of importance -- and moves closer to the Abraham Lincoln, FDR, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson realm of presidents: Men who risked a great deal personally to move the country forward socially. And given the fact that he can point to the 12 consecutive months of job losses before taking office and the 26 consecutive months (and counting) of job growth since 2010, there's no reason to believe the economy will cease to be his campaign's top focus. As it should be. We'll find out if the GOP agrees. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: For years, the economy has been seen as the dominant issue .

"(CNN) -- When my son was in middle school, I remember attending one of his school band concerts that wasn't very good. In fact, it sucked. At times, it sounded as if half the band was playing one song and the other half was playing something totally different. And because I don't want my son to grow up to be a loser, I told him straight out what I thought. ""How was it?"" he asked. ""It was pretty bad,"" I said. ""I know, right?"" my son agreed, smiling. ""We're not good at all."" And then we both laughed until we had tears in our eyes. I don't claim to know everything about parenting, but I do know parents do their children a disservice by constantly sugarcoating their shortcomings to protect their feelings. I can't think of a more surefire way to raise a loser than not allowing a child to learn what it really takes to be a winner. Not that everything in life is a competition. But if children can't handle competition when it's necessary, or take some criticism, or never strive to be better because their parents inadvertently programmed them to believe they are already the best even when they're not, then they are in for some serious shocks and bumps down the road. That's the part of the discussion that's missing from all the chatter about David McCullough Jr.'s controversial ""You Are Not Special"" commencement speech. He didn't call the Wellesley High School Class of 2012 a bunch of lowlifes who won't amount to anything. Rather, he was adjusting their lenses so that they could see the world they were about to enter more clearly. ""Across the country no fewer than 3.2 million seniors are graduating about now from more than 37,000 high schools,"" McCullough said. ""That's 37,000 valedictorians... 37,000 class presidents... 92,000 harmonizing altos... 340,000 swaggering jocks ... 2,185,967 pairs of Uggs. But why limit ourselves to high school? After all, you're leaving it. So think about this: Even if you're one in a million, on a planet of 6.8 billion that means there are nearly 7,000 people just like you."" One man's ""ouch"" is another man's ""right on brother,"" and you can count me among the latter. My son is special ... to me. He is special to his mother, grandparents, aunts, uncles and friends. But he is not special to everyone, and he is not great at everything. None of us are. If the students at Wellesley didn't know this before their last moments of high school, I am glad McCullough was there to help them out before life taught them that lesson in less forgiving ways. Some folks have faulted McCullough, an English teacher at Wellesley, for his tough words. Sure, the job of high school teachers is not to tear down students' self-esteem. But it's certainly not to inflate students' sense of self-worth with a bunch of unearned compliments and half-truths. There is a middle ground where ""how things are"" and ""how things can be"" meets. It is at this middle point where growth happens. But if parents, teachers and the other adults in a child's life never acknowledge ""how things are"" -- no matter how good the intention may be -- then they are denying that child an opportunity to mature, to develop a strong sense of self-confidence that can only be earned by recognizing shortcomings and dealing with disappointments and failures. ""And I hope you caught me when I said 'one of the best,' "" McCullough said. ""I said 'one of the best' so we can feel better about ourselves, so we can bask in a little easy distinction, however vague and unverifiable, and count ourselves among the elite, whoever they might be, and enjoy a perceived leg up on the perceived competition. But the phrase defies logic. By definition there can be only one best. You're it or you're not."" Which is why McCullough also talked about the importance of pursuing passions for the sake of passions, rather than seeking accolades or striking off items from an arbitrary checklist. Accolades and lists may tell us about accomplishments, but life is meant to be experienced, not just accomplished. It's like the difference between reading books for the sake of reading and reading books just to get a good grade. Tell me, once you're done with school, are you then supposed to be done with reading books? I sure hope not. McCullough's point was that students should focus less on being seen as special and instead understand that living life is special in and of itself. As Rudyard Kipling so eloquently stated in his poem ""If"": . If you can dream -- and not make dreams your master; . If you can think -- and not make thoughts your aim; . If you can meet with triumph and disaster . And treat those two imposters just the same; . The synopsis of ""You Are Not Special"" may seem scathing, but I found the speech to be quite uplifting, and I shared it with my son. He has another three years to go before graduating from high school, but I always like to remind him that his family and friends think the world of him -- and for the most part, just about everyone else on this planet doesn't give a damn about him. That's not mean or cruel, good or bad, that's just the reality of life. And that's OK -- everyone is special to someone, but no one is special to all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson found teacher's ""You Are Not Special"" speech to grads uplifting .

"(CNN) -- Jennifer Tyrrell dislikes public speaking so much that when she was in high school, she almost failed marketing because she didn't want to speak in front of the class. But when the Boy Scouts of America made a decision that hurt her little boy Cruz, she did what any mother would do -- set aside her own fear, spoke up and, with the help of family and friends, is fighting back. ""I've never been involved with any kind of activism or anything like that before, so this is all new to me,"" the mother of four said. ""All I know is this has got to stop."" And by ""this,"" she is referring to the Boy Scouts' policy of banning gays and lesbians from being members or serving as leaders. Earlier this month Tyrrell was forced to resign as den leader of the Tiger Cubs for Pack 109 in Bridgeport, Ohio, because the national office learned she is a lesbian. So even though everyone in the local chapter loved her, she was forced out by the discrimination that is woven into the organization's bylaws. The cubs of Pack 109 are upset. But none more than Cruz, who is being forced to be away from his friends and is too young to fully understand why. He's only 7. He wasn't brought up to dislike people because they are different. He's too young to understand bigotry. Which is why Tyrrell is not taking any of this lying down. She started a change.org petition, in protest of the Boy Scout policy, that has amassed more than 120,000 signatures in a matter of days. I met Tyrrell and her beautiful family at the 23rd annual GLAAD Awards this past weekend. Numerous celebrities took the stage that night, but only Tyrrell managed to hush the crowd, save for a few sobs. I can remember sitting there wondering: What in the hell is wrong with them? The Girl Scouts of America, the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, as well as the 4-H Club all welcome gay kids and adult leaders, and none of those organizations bursts into flames. Needing answers, I reached out to the Boy Scouts and Deron Smith, the organization's director of public relations, sent me an official statement that in part read: . ""Our focus is on delivering the nation's foremost youth program of character development and values-based leadership training. Our mission does not include teaching young people about sex or sexual orientation, and we do not believe it is Scouting's role to introduce this topic in our youth development program."" Fair enough. So I asked Smith via e-mail if the group had received complaints that Tyrrell was attempting to turn the Scouts into an unofficial sex ed camp. He didn't answer that question. When I asked if heterosexuals were banned for being heterosexuals, Smith said, ""Heterosexuality does not conflict with Scouting's policy and is not a reason for removal from the program. However, if a leader chose to make it a focus of his or her time with youth they could be removed from the program."" Now I've never sat in one of Tyrrell's meetings, and so I can't speak as to what she did or did not do. So I asked some folks who would know, the parents of Pack 109. ""I'm not a city person,"" said Robert Dunn. ""I'm just a backwoods hick, and I don't think anybody around here have an issue with homosexuals. She did a wonderful job, and what they did to her was just horrible. ""When I told my son Jen was kicked out because she is gay, he didn't know what was wrong because he thought gay meant happy. He's just devastated."" Don Thomas, who has a grandson in Pack 109, e-mailed me, saying either he or his wife has been to ""every cub scout meeting my grandson has attended, also to every function, community event, Salvation Army ringing bells, collection of food for the needy....etc. I do not know where you are getting your information, but never ever has sex been brought up, not in any way shape or form. In fact, I was not aware of Jen even being gay for quite some time.....wasn't an issue or concern."" My favorite response came from Crystal Sabinsky, who said, ""the boys knew her as Tiger Leader Jen, not Gay Tiger Leader Jen. They are only first graders. Most don't even understand what 'gay' or 'lesbian' mean."" So again, I sit and wonder: What in the hell is wrong with them? While it's commendable that Tyrrell is fighting, I'm ticked off that she has to. It's 2012, for heaven's sake. Who, after the zoo-like Casey Anthony trial, still believes being straight automatically makes you a good influence to have around children? Tyrrell is clearly just a good mother, trying to invest in her son. She didn't ask to be den leader a little over a year ago -- she was selected because the pack loves her. She was chosen to be treasurer because everyone trusts her. Maybe being loved and trusted conflicts with the values of the Boy Scouts, because according to the folks who were actually around Tyrrell, sexual orientation was never added to the handbook. It just doesn't make sense. Then again, bigotry never does.

"(CNN) -- Fidel Castro will continue to have a hand in shaping Cuba's future, but his brother and successor will remain in firm control of the government, Castro's daughter said Monday. Alina Fernandez, daughter of Fidel Castro, has long opposed her father's regime. ""He is still behind the scenes, but Raúl is making the decisions,"" Alina Fernandez told CNN. ""No doubt about it."" Fidel Castro's nearly five decades of rule ended Sunday when Cuba's National Assembly chose his younger brother to be the Communist nation's new president. Raúl Castro, 76, assumed temporary control of Cuba more than a year ago after his brother suffered health problems. The lawmakers' selection, which had been widely expected, came five days after Fidel Castro, 81, announced his resignation in a letter published in Cuba's state-run newspaper, Granma. In his address to the National Assembly, Raúl Castro proposed that ""we consult Fidel"" on important decisions, which the 614 members of the legislative body unanimously passed.

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- December 13, 1996. My son, barely a few moments old, is crying. I walk toward the medical room bassinette where he is lying, smile, and then tell him not to worry... daddy's here. And then ever so gently I place his tiny hand inside mine and again tell him daddy's here... I will keep you safe. He stops crying. I start. And thus began a parent and child relationship that is probably no different than the billions that came before that night and the billions in the 16 years after. Of all the natural instincts that enslave my body, the desire to love and protect my son is a master I have never rebelled against. And I am sure many of you can agree: Being a parent can be both a person's greatest joy and greatest sense of anxiety. ""I will keep you safe,"" is what we tell them. And then something like the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary happens, or the shooting at the mall in Oregon, or the movie theater in Aurora, and you are reminded of how increasingly difficult it is to do just that. There have been 31 school shootings since Columbine in 1999, and sadly there is not a damn thing to suggest there won't be 31 more. In my 20 years of journalism, I have had quite a few conversations with mourning mothers and fathers who have had to bury their children. Last year I interviewed a father who dropped his son off at football practice and never saw him alive again -- taken by an undiagnosed heart ailment. I cried for hours afterward. I'm sure that father still cries on occasion today. But something different grips your soul when you know the cause of a child's premature death was not brought on by ill health or an accident, but rather an outbreak of senseless violence that took place somewhere we once viewed as safe -- like an elementary school. Or as we saw late this summer in Wisconsin, a place of worship. We hurt and weep for the victims while fighting off a chilling fear that the same thing can happen to us. I can take my son to the doctor to have his heart checked out, but how do I or any of us drop our children off at school on Monday and not be worried? Scared? Some of us who choose to live in small cities or nice neighborhoods used to be able to cloak ourselves with the comfort of ""it can't happen here."" But in this new America, it can. It has. Newtown, Connecticut, is far from the mean streets of New York City. There are fewer than 28,000 people there. And it happened. What are parents supposed to do? ""I will keep you safe"" is so much harder today, and at times I feel as if I'm running out of places to hide. Do I keep him away from the movie theater? The mall? School? Tragedies like these usually reignite discussions surrounding gun laws, but those talks and possible changes do nothing to ease the fear millions of parents are dealing with right now. Guns are the symptoms, the true disease is a culture that embraces, glorifies, and monetizes violence. In the summer of 2011, a man drove through the heart of my mid-size city's downtown and randomly sprayed the streets with bullets -- striking innocent bystanders before speeding down the street and eventually killing himself. What am I supposed to do, not let my son go to the library that's down there? ""I will keep you safe"" is my promise to him, and there are days in which I feel as if this new America is determined to make keeping that promise as hard as possible. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: The promise a parent makes to a child is ""I will keep you safe""

"(CNN) -- I have a good friend in New York who turned the upstairs of her house into a bed and breakfast to help make ends meet -- a great idea on paper. My girlfriend was not a morning person. But she is now -- up and making breakfast with a smile -- because she likes the lights staying on more than she dislikes alarm clocks. She also has a consulting company and gives speeches. In other words, she's a hustler in the new economy. That word used to seem a little unsavory. ""Hustler."" Like the seedy magazine. It was as if there was something a little suspicious about someone who didn't have one source of income from a ""legitimate"" job. Of course, poor folks always hustled -- a 9 to 5 complemented with fixing cars on the weekend or doing hair in the kitchen. But a lot of Americans have to hustle now -- as much as 20% of us are deemed underemployed, or juggling multiple gigs to pay the bills since the recession started in 2007. Last summer, The New York Times ran a story about the growing trend of people holding down several different jobs and led the piece with a then-26-year-old graduate of the University of Chicago, who had four jobs. ""I do everything,"" he said. And he wasn't kidding: drawing income from e-commerce work, translating textbooks and developing -- get this -- reality TV. When students from a prestigious school like the University of Chicago are running from job to job, you know there's no shame in the hustle. Not even for those of us in the so-called ""elite media."" In 2009, advertising revenue declined for every form of media with the exception of the Internet. A Council of Economic Advisors study just reported the newspaper industry is shrinking faster than any other industry in the United States. Thousands of journalism jobs are gone. Not just lost, but gone -- deemed no longer necessary. That is why journalism landed on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' top 30 list of projected declining employment, along with farmers and file clerks. This is another wrinkle of our new jobs market reality, one that is the unfortunate byproduct of technology: displaced workers, evaporated professions. The more our production becomes more efficient thanks to technology, the more we'll see the fat being cut. And by fat, I mean jobs. Like bookstore owners, CD-store clerks and postal workers. Oh, there will always be careers. There will always be work. But maybe not in the way we talk about it today. The jobs with benefits and pensions and retirement plans. The ones that come with a guaranteed 40 hours and the promise of covering all of our expenses from that one source. A recent Rutgers University study found the median salary for recent college graduates is $27,000, down $3,000 from 2007. And that's before taxes and student loan payments. They're not technically underemployed, but you've got to wonder how someone living in a major urban city survives making $27,000. You know, besides moving back in with their parents or having 25 roommates? They get a side gig going. The job numbers are encouraging. But there is a fascinating dynamic reshaping our thinking about what we do for a living. Some of us will always go into professions, but others are learning to become professionals: nimble, multiskilled job creators for ourselves. We have to. We're a country trying to pull itself out of a job crisis while the most viable, the most exciting industry, technology, is indirectly eliminating jobs. I often look out of my airplane window when landing at an airport and see the people manually directing traffic. I wonder how much longer those kind of jobs are going to be around. Video stores are giving way to downloads, toll booth clerks replaced by automated machines. The self-checkout option at the grocery store is faster, but it also means fewer cashiers, fewer jobs. It's almost like some weird form of economic cannibalism. Many of the journalists who were laid off found other means of making money, like freelancing, grant writing, public relations. Maybe all three. There is something to be said about the kind of jobs we are gaining. People once were afraid to start their own businesses because they didn't want to lose the security of a paycheck or the health insurance that typically came with a good job. Now layoffs and buyouts are forcing many of us to be reluctant entrepreneurs. Such is the new reality. And it's doubtful the recovery and more jobs will change that because technology will continue to eat away at jobs and starting incomes won't cover all of our living expenses. One of the reasons why so many companies are registering record profits, but temp jobs have grown for the eighth straight month, is that it's cheaper to hire three people at 20 hours a week than one at 60, plus overtime and benefits. It's just capitalism doing what it's designed to do: be as profitable as possible. We simply must adjust. And that, my friends, is the hustle. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: Hustling no longer a dirty word: It means holding down a couple jobs .

"(CNN) -- Let's be clear about one thing: Vice President Joe Biden's recent comment about being OK with marriage equality did not place the president in a difficult situation. The president placed the president in a difficult situation the day he decided to push his conscience back into the closet. In 1996, when Barack Obama first ran for state office, he was in support of marriage equality. But once he started targeting the national stage, he became less supportive. Today he says he's ""evolving,"" which seems to be shorthand for, ""Back off, I don't want to lose this election."" To be fair, Obama's not the first politician to rewrite his history for political gain and he certainly won't be the last (right, Mitt?). And without question Obama has done more to help the gay community than any other president. But this awkward dance he's doing with the issue of same-sex marriage is a self-inflicted wound to his integrity. All Biden did was speak from the heart. Just because the president lacks the fortitude to do the same does not mean the campaign should try to massage Biden's words to mean something other than their original intent. Besides, Biden's comments, along with Education Secretary Arne Duncan, may feel good, but they're not moving any needles. There is no real pressure the gay community can put on the president, because the reality is the gay community doesn't have any leverage. It's either Obama or the guy who vows to push a Constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages. No, the only question is how many days President Obama will allow his legacy to reside on the wrong side of history. How many pages of his future biographies does he want dedicated to him not supporting this issue? Thirty years from now, when the CNN specials are aired and the documentaries made, how much footage does Obama want his grandchildren to see of him ... ""evolving""? Because at this point, that's what it all boils down to, the choice to be politically savvy versus the choice to follow the heart of the man who on more than one occasion quoted the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in saying ""justice delayed is justice denied."" It's an extremely difficult position to be in, but Biden and Duncan and the Clintons, and Dick Cheney, none of them put the president in that position. He did it to himself and only he can get himself out. If he's so inclined. In the HBO series, ""Game of Thrones"", there was a powerful character who often drew praiseâ€”from foe and ally alikeâ€”for his honesty and integrity. That character, Ned Stark, was also called a fool, and eventually was beheaded in front of a cheering crowd before the end of the first season. You see in the game of thrones, it's more advantageous to be perceived as a man of honor than to actually be one. And when you realize how many lies, concessions and deals are necessary to become president, then you realize the race to the White House is nothing but a real life game of thrones. Obama could come out in support of marriage equality and then see if the recent Pew poll showing more Americans support marriage equality than oppose it is actually true. That would be the honorable -- and foolish -- thing to do. Or he could wait to see if he's re-elected first before announcing he's finally evolved. Obviously, he would be taken to task for waiting so long to voice support for marriage equality, but it would also be obvious why he did. There was a story in the April 20 edition of JET Magazine that featured four black pastors who aligned themselves with conservatives over the issue of marriage equality. One of those churches, Upper Room Church of God in Christ, is in North Carolina, the state that is going to the polls on Tuesday to decide whether to add an amendment banning same-sex marriages to its state constitution. The amendment would also ban ""civil unions"" and ""domestic partnerships"". Is throwing support behind equality worth alienating voters? Maybe not. During a recent campaign stop in North Carolina, the president didn't bring the measure up. But he has called the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional, wants it repealed and supports the Respect for Marriage Act. Oh so close, isn't he? And yet, no one is sorta married. You either are or you aren't and most gay people are not, cannot get married. As a result, loving, committed couples pay more in taxes because they can't file jointly or sometimes are unable to cover their family with work issued health insurance. All on Obama's watch. Funny... barely a week has passed since introducing the new campaign slogan ""Forward"" and yet Obama seems content to be in this hypocritical holding pattern on this particular issue. I guess he's no Ned Stark. For better and for worse.

"(CNN) -- I believe it was the great American philosopher Kenny Rogers, who, while meditating on the nuances of Darwinism, gave the world this piece of advice: . ""You got to know when to hold 'em/Know when to fold 'em/Know when to walk away/Know when to run."" Any Democrat who might want to challenge a Republican-led effort to ban welfare recipients from spending federal aid in strip clubs and casinos needs to fold 'em. Walk away. Run. The House ""strip club"" bill just passed, 395 to 27, with only 26 Democrats and one Republican voting against it. But it's not only a battle those 26 Democrats can't win in the PR arena, it is a battle that completely undermines the narrative about Republicans not caring about the middle class. After all, how can the opponents genuinely criticize Republicans for trying to make cuts in aid while resisting a seemingly innocuous effort to avoid welfare fraud, a big concern for taxpayers? The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families -- or welfare -- supplies cash to working poor families using what amounts to a debit card. Last year, about 1.8 million families received a few hundred federal dollars each month to help make ends meet. It's meant to pay for necessities like food and rent. The average American can relate to that, because a lot of us have been there. But media reports say that some of those cards were used in ATMs in strip clubs, liquor stores, Las Vegas casinos, even cruise ships -- locations average Americans can also relate to, but not with taxpayers' money involved. Now, just because a few people are using these cards at strip club ATMs does not signal widespread fraud. In fact, less than half of 1% of benefits in California were withdrawn in casinos and strip clubs, and it's impossible to tell where the money was spent, according to the Western Center on Law and Poverty. But even still, who can be opposed to the government taking steps to discourage abuse, especially as the nation is wrestling with budget cut decisions? I certainly didn't expect any Democrat to be against a government regulation, given the amount of criticism the party hurls at Republicans for deregulating everything. Again: Welfare checks, strip clubs, casinos ... seems like a no-brainer, right? And yet Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wisconsin, called the measure ""another effort to berate those people who are in the lower class."" Â . Seriously Moore -- fold 'em. Trying to massage this bill into a message about Republicans demonizing the poor doesn't make liberals look like fighters for the little guy. It makes them look like free-wheeling hedonists; just another one of those times when some Democrats may be right in the small picture, but are totally missing the big one. Elizabeth Lower-Basch, a senior analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy, said: ""This is another example of setting policies based on attention-grabbing news stories with little connection to the underlying reality and that are designed to reinforce the 'unworthy poor' stereotype."" Yes, this bill is a grandstanding exercise that does something close to nothing in terms of impacting the overall budget, or the very real problem with poverty. But so what? The flipside is that some Democrats look as if they don't want to address welfare fraud while they fight welfare cuts, which, if you think about it, looks a lot worse. The Democrats against this bill should fold their hand, cut their losses and live to grandstand another day. And as long as Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich are each within an earshot of a microphone, the chances are pretty good that there will be plenty of disconnected GOP remarks regarding poor people to grandstand on for the months ahead. Does Congress have better things to do? Absolutely. But that doesn't mean it should avoid doing the little things, and this is a little thing the Senate should pass when the bill arrives for a vote, along with testing welfare recipients and legislators for drugs. But Democrats shouldn't just take my word on in it. I encourage them to walk into any manufacturing plant in the Midwest and ask the workers how they feel about a portion of their tax dollars being spent on strippers by people on welfare. Yeah, as I said, just fold 'em. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter. Join the conversation on Facebook.Â .

"(CNN) -- My son had barely taken his first breath when the people in the hospital started telling me how lucky I was. Not because he was healthy, mind you, but because he was a he. ""It's easier to raise boys,"" I was told. And for a while I actually believed them. Then I started paying attention. Did you know boys are more likely to drop out of high school than girls? Or that there are more female college students than male? And did you know the imprisonment rate for men is roughly 15 times higher than the rate for women? If this is what boys being easier to raise than girls looks like, coul`d you imagine how many men would be in jail if raising girls got any harder? We worry so much about girls getting hurt -- and justifiably so -- but interestingly enough, the stats show it's our boys who are more likely to get robbed, attacked or even murdered. We see girls as fragile orchids and boys as plastic plants. But let's face it: At the core of this line of thinking isn't safety -- it's sex. When someone offers this piece of advice, it's with the thinking that girls have to be protected from boys who will say and do just about anything to get in their pants. What's typically missing from this discussion is the challenge to parents -- particularly fathers -- not to raise a liar and a cheat. True, parents of boys do not  have to worry about them coming home pregnant, but does that mean an unplanned pregnancy can be considered ""the girl's problem""? After all, a boy's girlfriend did not get pregnant asexually. That's why I'm Tebowing day and night, hoping my 15-year-old has the will to stay away from sex -- even though the world all around him tells him there's something wrong with him if he does. Easier? Ha. Try different. A little girl who likes to play sports is called a tomboy. A little boy who doesn't like to play sports is called weird. A teen girl who says ""no"" is called a good girl. A teen boy who says ""no"" is called a sissy. A lot of words describe what it's like for parents who are trying to teach their teenage son how to be his own man in a high school setting that demands conformity, but ""easy"" is not one of them. I know, I know, ""boys will be boys"" is the accepted rule of thumb. But given that we have a federal department that hunts down and sometimes arrests deadbeat fathers, doesn't that raise the question: What kind of boys are we raising? And if they're dropping out of high school at a faster clip than girls, why do we think raising them is easier? Last year, I wrote a piece with the headline ""Parents, don't dress your girls like tramps."" I received a lot of e-mails from offended readers who told me I had no idea how hard it was to avoid buying sexy clothing for their little princesses. I usually responded by reminding them I never said it wasn't hard. And then I asked if they've ever seen the words on many of the T-shirts aimed at young men. They may not be blatantly inappropriate, like a cut-off shirt that reveals their bellybuttons, but if I had a dollar for every T-shirt I've read that sexualizes the words ""balls,"" ""sticks"" or ""size,"" I could retire. I guess if parents don't care if their son thinks being a man begins and ends with his penis, then yes, I can see how some would think raising a boy is easier. But if you're actually trying to raise a gentleman, and you hear LMFAO rap ""I'm running through these hos like Drano"" -- as they do in ""Party Rock Anthem,"" the second most popular song of 2011 -- then you're not breathing a sigh of relief because it's so much easier to raise a boy. Instead you're wondering how much of what you're trying to teach him soaks in, versus what our culture says is OK. We've made so many advances as a society in terms of gender equity, and yet we still hold on to this nonsensical double standard that celebrates sexually active boys while demonizing their female counterparts, as if we can have a lot of one without the other. This kind of thinking is handed down from generation to generation almost as soon as the umbilical cord is cut. But how can we continue to believe boys are easier to raise than girls, when only 42% of custodial moms received all of their child support payments in 2009? Some see loose women in that statistic. I see some men who are punks. Perhaps if we stopped viewing raising our boys as easier, we wouldn't have to deal with so many men who still behave like boys later in life.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- I had just pulled up in front of my hotel in Los Angeles when I heard Whitney Houston had died at the Beverly Hilton, just a few blocks from where I was staying. I sat motionless in the car for a brief moment, not in shock, but temporarily paralyzed by a profound sense of sadness. She was only 48. Later that night, a large crowd of people hovered outside the site of her passing, some holding lit candles, others holding one another. It may be weeks before we officially know what happened. The autopsy is complete, but the toxicology report is still pending. But many of us have already drawn our own conclusions based upon Whitney's well-documented -- and sometimes mocked -- struggle with drug addiction. I hope she can at last have the peace that seemed to avoid her over the last 15 years of her life: the marriage to Bobby Brown, the reality show, the erratic interviews and appearances, and the heartbreaking live performances that served only to remind us that her voice, The Voice, was gone, and Whitney was lost. We all could see she needed help -- but only she could seek it. That's why if you didn't get goosebumps during Jennifer Hudson's Grammy tribute on Sunday, you may not be fully human. Hudson sang ""I Will Always Love You,"" in a lower key than Whitney's signature version, but with a delivery that served a much higher purpose. We need to say our goodbyes and Hudson's performance was part of this process. Buying Whitney's music is another, as evidenced by the presence of all of her classic singles currently occupying the iTunes chart. My favorite? ""The Greatest Love of All,"" mostly for the line,""Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all."" So prophetic, so empowering. I can't help but think if she had lived by those words she might never have lost her magnificent voice. She might still be with us today. All weekend long, we've seen clips of her Diane Sawyer interview from 2002, in which she talked about her struggles. Many of us were not very kind afterward, joking about her ""crack is wack"" line, and wondered how someone so beautiful and talented, rich and famous, could struggle. From the outside looking in, it looked as if she had it all. If there's ever been an example of money not buying happiness, the Whitney Houston tragedy would be it. There was a moment when no other singer on the planet possessed her range, power and vocal clarity. True, she didn't always record the most groundbreaking material. In fact, an argument can be made that the arrangement of some of her most successful singles epitomized the radio-friendly manufacturing that choked a lot of creativity out of late '80s music. And certainly the rise of grunge and hip-hop in the '90s served as a rebellion against the numbing sound of that predictability. But there was always room for Whitney because her voice made room. Two of her biggest hits -- ""The Greatest Love of All"" and ""I Will Always Love You"" -- were originally recorded by George Benson and Dolly Parton, two very successful artists. But once Whitney got hold of those songs they became hers. So, with all due respect to Adele and Hudson and all the other powerhouse vocalists today, it's doubtful anyone can take a Whitney Houston song and make us forget it is a Whitney Houston song. In fact, the kiss of death for any contestant competing on ""American Idol"" or any of its copycats is to try to sing Whitney. I don't know why they even try. The competition is tough enough without the added, self-imposed pressure of trying to reach a bar so high that many use the word ""angelic"" to describe it. If I remember correctly, there was a time in which the angels themselves would gather round to hear Whitney sing. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter. Join the conversation on Facebook.

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- I am sitting here in front of my computer, looking at the headline that former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno has died, and I honestly don't know how or what I should feel. If he had passed a year ago, it would be a no-brainer. For a World War II soldier who dedicated more than 50 years to one institution and one wife during a time in which examples of both grow rarer by the decade, it seems flags should be flown at half staff. But then there's Jerry Sandusky. And then there's Paterno's silence and then ... well with all due respect to the Paterno family, his loved ones and the Penn State community, uninterrupted mourning becomes difficult. Now for those reading this column expecting a glowing obituary for a renowned coach who truly deserves one, you may want to click elsewhere as this is not that kind of a piece. And for anyone hoping I rip Paterno to shreds, again you will need to look elsewhere. I am writing for those of us trapped in the middle -- for those who watched the Penn State story unfold without the ability to see the world in black and white. I am genuinely saddened to hear a wife has lost her husband and children have lost their father. But that mourning for the Paternos subconsciously shifts to mourning the innocence of the little boys that could have been saved had Paterno fought to protect them with as much vigilance as he used to protect his good name in the aftermath of the scandal. It's unfair to blame Paterno for what Sandusky is accused of doing, but it's impossible to accept Paterno did anywhere near to all he could by simply alerting two university officials to one incident. Years passed and the coach didn't utter one word about what he knew about Sandusky to the media but he managed to address the media on his front porch within hours of his firing. If you've ever held a crying child in your arms, it's hard to see Paterno as a victim of the media. But if you've ever made a mistake, if you've ever mishandled a difficult situation, if you've ever done something you've regretted, then it should be hard to characterize JoePa -- a man who has done so much good outside of football -- as a pariah. And therein lies the rub: What do you do when a wonderful man who made a terrible mistake dies? How do you properly honor an admirable life without whitewashing the egregious shortcomings that ruined the lives of others? I see the Penn State students paying tribute to Paterno in front of his statue on campus and wonder how many would still do so if they had young children of their own to protect. How many would do so if they were one of Sandusky's alleged victims. I am not directly tied to the scandal at Happy Valley, so I wasn't among those who were wronged and thus it's not really my place to judge or forgive. But who among us can forget? Though the coroner's office will say cancer was the cause of death, those who know the story well will say Paterno died of a broken heart, a sad ending for a man who truly deserved better. And then you think about the children who allegedly grew up broken because of Sandusky's acts and Paterno's silence and you wonder who deserved better than them? But this kind of conflict is not unique to Paterno. I look at the way people lionize President Ronald Reagan and I wonder how they feel about Reagan letting years go by without publicly addressing the AIDS epidemic (possibly because the disease initially was seen as primarily affecting gays) or that he vetoed a comprehensive anti-apartheid act that would have placed sanctions on South Africa. I watched the response to the manslaughter verdict against Michael Jackson's doctor and marveled at the passion people had for justice for a likely drug addict who was twice accused of child molestation. If Jackson wasn't such an amazing artist, would the people outside of the courthouse decked out in glitter and holding signs be so forgiving? And did they really forgive Jackson for his alleged trespasses or did they simply chose to ignore them because they got in the way of their neatly packaged narrative? Paterno has died, and I do not know how to compartmentalize the good from the bad. Just as I am incapable of thinking about Reagan without seeing the thousands and thousands of ailing Americans he didn't even try to help. Or how hard it is to listen to a Michael Jackson song and not wonder about the boys he was accused of molesting -- or how hard it is to watch reruns of ""Seinfeld"" and not recall the racist rant from the actor who played my once favorite character, Kramer. That's the good thing about 24-hour media: it is hard to keep dirty little secrets. But this is also the bad thing. In a lot of ways, life was easier when we didn't know as much. We could have mourned a hero like Paterno and not feel conflicted. If you do feel conflicted. Some people can see the world in black and white. I'm not one of those people.

"(CNN) -- Within the next day or two we could hear from the special prosecutor's office about her decision on whether to charge George Zimmerman. Regardless of what she says, chances are a lot of people are not going to be happy with the decision. It's an emotional story with many layers that will likely end with more questions than answers, and more division than unity along racial lines. I know when I heard about Trayvon Martin's killing, the story immediately touched my heart because I could see my own 15-year-old son in Trayvon. Similarly, when I heard about the apparent racially motivated killing spree in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last week, it angered me because I could see my brothers and uncles in the slain victims. But something different happened inside when I saw the video of a white tourist being savagely beaten and stripped by a bunch of black thugs in Baltimore over St. Patrick's Day weekend. My heart wasn't touched. I didn't get angry. Instead, I just became cold. I didn't want the individuals involved to be arrested. I wanted them thrown in jail for life. I thought what possible good could adults who would do that to another human being bring to society? Some folks can be rehabilitated, but sometimes it's best to just cut our losses. Why bother wasting taxpayers' dollars on a trial over something that simply cannot and should not be defended? As I watched the helpless man being kicked and heard him being laughed at, I just wanted those hoodlums escorted to solitary confinement and the key thrown away. As I told you, I became cold. Sick even. I posted the video on my Facebook wall and soon found myself in a conversation with a buddy of mine, Brian, who I've known since grad school. In my frustration I e-mailed ""I hate people."" Brian immediately hit back: ""No you don't. You love people, that is why this upset you so much."" He was right. I don't hate people. I just hated what happened to that guy, just like I hated what happened to the victims in Tulsa. But what I really hate is how the video is only going to confirm what so many whites think about blacks and the arrests are only going to confirm what so many blacks think about whites. That's where much of the focus will inevitably go instead of to what I think is far more important, and that is what blacks think about ourselves. I don't need to tell you what the response from the black community would be if the victim in the Baltimore video was black and the assailants white. But for some reason many blacks puree crimes of this nature through some warped situational ethics filter, which in the end only makes a mockery of the community more than it empowers it. For if President Obama had a son, he would look like Trayvon, but he would also look like one of the assailants in that video. That's the uncomfortable truth that the black community must deal with: Racism still hurts us, but not nearly as much as we hurt ourselves. The same weekend the man in Baltimore was attacked, in Chicago 10 people were killed and 40 were wounded, including a 6-year-old girl who was shot dead while she was playing on the front porch of her home in the Little Village neighborhood. Neighborhoods such as Little Village, and West Englewood, which has a homicide rate five times that of the rest of the city, are mostly black and Latino. Since 2008, nearly 80% of the more than 500 killings of youth in Chicago have occurred in the 22 black and Latino neighborhoods. Those deaths are not coming by the hands of the KKK but by people who look a lot like the ones in that St. Patrick's Day video. Or the ones in the video that went viral in February in which a bunch of black thugs attacked a black man as he left a grocery store. Or the ones in the video that went viral three years ago in which a bunch of black thugs attacked and killed a 16-year-old honor roll student, who was also black. Sadly, I could go on, but I think the picture is clear. What isn't as clear is what the black community is going to do about it. We know how to come together and fight against injustice when the alleged perpetrators are white. However we're not quite sure how to deal with injustice as a community when the perpetrators look like us -- and that is troubling, because when you look at the statistics, it seems the survival of the black community depends more on figuring that part out than dealing with the George Zimmermans of the world.

"(CNN) -- Here is what the election next year is about: the fence-sitters, the independent voters. At this point, there is not much President Barack Obama can say that will win over conservatives, and given the current GOP field, he doesn't have to worry too much about losing liberals. But what can he say to convince the middle to give him four more years? Well, he could start by, to paraphrase Bonnie Raitt, giving them something to talk about. Vice President Hillary Clinton? Now that's a talker. Of course if Republicans do something silly like saddle themselves with Newt Gingrich or another polarizing figure, whose politics or past makes the nominee too unappealing to us independents, then there won't be a need for such a change at the top. However, if a moderate does make it out of the GOP, and Obama looks to be in a dogfight, I can't think of a ticket that would generate more wattage than Obama-Clinton '12. Would the move be characterized by critics as an obvious ploy to attract women? Well, yeah. And to a degree they'll be right: After all, this is politics. But the critics would have to tread lightly, because Clinton would likely be at least as accomplished, and probably more so, than any other person on either ballot. This would not be Obama pulling a John McCain, selecting someone who isn't qualified in hopes of injecting fresh blood into a struggling campaign. If Clinton had to take over the presidency, I think many people on both sides can agree that scenario would be much more desirable than one in which Sarah Palin was running the show. In fact, comparing Clinton's pedigree to Palin's or GOP presidential candidate Michele Bachmann's is like comparing an oak tree to a handful of seaweed. If Clinton was robbed before, she would receive recompense in 2012, and by 2016 be in an even stronger position to be the first female president than she was in 2008. Obama selecting Clinton as his running mate in 2008, after a sometimes biting primary season, would have rung hollow. Now, after she's spent four years working with him as secretary of state, an executive partnership would be accepted as authentic. This fall she said she had no interest in running for public office, which is not the same as saying she won't run. The reason why she was even approached with the question is because a fall Bloomberg poll found 34% of Americans believe the country would've been better if she'd been in charge. Former Vice President Dick Cheney said he thought Clinton was going to win the Democratic nomination and that ""she's probably the most competent person they've got in their Cabinet,"" and he suggested she should run against Obama in another primary. Of course Cheney was pushing his new book and probably trying to sow dissent, but he did echo what most everyone in Washington knows -- Clinton brings gravitas few people possess. If those who rallied around her presidential bid were to rally behind her for the vice-presidential nod, it's hard to imagine who in the Republican field could match what she would bring. Part of the reason that Obama is vulnerable is not simply that the economy is struggling and Republicans are fired up to defeat him. It's because his base does not appear to be fired up for him to win. Quite a few high-profile supporters have expressed disappointment. Quite a few low-profile supporters have expressed buyer's remorse -- not for picking Obama over McCain but for selecting Obama over Clinton. Putting her name on the ticket as vice president would give Obama something Joe Biden never brought to the table -- buzz. Energy. Excitement. That's no knock on Joe. OK, it is, but I'm sure he knows he can't draw a crowd like Hillary. Sure, we're 11 months away, and given that Gingrich is the sixth GOP front-runner in less than a year -- including two with reality TV shows -- a lot can still happen. But there is no denying that the electricity Obama generated during the 2007-08 campaign is simply not there this time. Some of his supporters are disappointed with the compromises he's made since taking office. Others are frustrated he hasn't done more to help their specific community or interest group. And while the economy is improving, the recovery numbers are way too pedestrian to be used as an inspiring talking point for voters sitting on the fence. Back in 2008, political strategists on both sides of the aisle could offer a litany of reasons why Obama defeated McCain -- from the Republican candidate being framed as an extension of George W. Bush, to Obama's charisma and an electorate excited by the opportunity to rewrite history. But a year from now, there won't be as many variables explaining why Obama won re-election. In fact, the rationale could likely summed up in one word: Hillary. Obama's one-time foe is now his ace in the hole. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: An Obama-Clinton re-election ticket would give new life to campaign .

"(CNN) -- In politics, we're all used to seeing various ""cards"" being played to fire up voters and gain the upper hand. The most popular is the ""race card,"" but there are others in the deck, such as the ""Jesus card,"" the ""gender card"" and the ""immigration card."" But Newt Gingrich took the card game to a whole new level this past weekend when he whipped out the hardly used, rarely seen ""George Washington card."" Speaking to a church in Georgia, Gingrich criticized President Barack Obama for apologizing to the Afghan people for the accidental burning of Qurans at a military base -- an incident that spurred riots and dozens of deaths in retaliation. The former House speaker told the congregation that President Washington would not have apologized ""to those who are killing us."" Now, besides the fact Obama did not apologize ""to those who are killing us"" or that our generals also apologized for the mistake or that the Lord's Prayer asks God to forgive us of our trespasses as we forgive those who have trespassed against us -- I'm trying to figure out who, besides a ""Jeopardy!"" contestant, whips out a George Washington card in the first place? That's the problem with Gingrich and the other GOP challengers. It seems they have mistaken their base's fervor to defeat Obama for a fervor to hear them pander. Remember Gingrich's moon base speech while he was campaigning near NASA? Or Mitt Romney quoting ""America the Beautiful"" while in Iowa, saying: ""If you count corn as an amber wave of grain, why, you have them right here. What a wonderful place this is."" Seriously, who says that? The GOP's once credible attacks on the president's record have morphed into an incredible attack on the country's intelligence. That change is reflected by Obama's double-digit lead over the GOP field. While ""amber waves of grain"" is pretty bad, I thought Romney showing up in Michigan last fall saying, ""The trees are the right height. The grass is the right color for this time of year, kind of a brownish-greenish sort of thing. It just feels right,"" was as low as pandering could go. Then he showed up in Detroit a couple of days ago and repeated that the ""trees are the right height."" Hurling out chunks of red meat at a rally is a longstanding practice. Massaging a position to suit the polls, or support the party, is something voters don't like, but we understand the rationale. But telling a crowd you love their trees and dead grass? Ridiculous. Granted, some of us are gullible enough to give each other high-fives because Rick Santorum called Obama a snob for promoting a college education. But the rest of us look at ""Slick Rick's"" college degree, law degree and MBA, the fact that he's sending his kids to college and owns at least six properties, and has earned millions, and wonder -- What is he talking about? Virtually every socioeconomic study looking at the intersection of income and education shows a direct correlation between the two. For Santorum to vilify higher education for political gain -- while obviously benefiting from attending universities -- is embarrassing. Then saying that John F. Kennedy's famous 1960 speech standing up for the separation of church and state made him want to throw up? Well, that makes me nauseous. Sometimes it seems as if Santorum and the others are content with pushing each other closer and closer to the edge of idiocy because that's easier than pushing ideas to convince voters they're the best person for the job. It's a tactic that might be fine for early cheers in February but will run out of steam the longer this process goes. Usually, a tough primary makes a candidate stronger for the general election, but between the exposure of character flaws and this dumbing-down of rhetoric, it seems to be having the reverse effect on the GOP. In November, a Pew poll showed then-front-runner Romney was leading Obama 53%-41% among independents. Now, Obama's up 51%-42%, and the president hasn't even started campaigning aggressively. Given some of the disconnected lunacy already heard during the primary, there's no telling what the candidates think they have to say to prove their tea party street cred and lock down the nomination. I don't know about you, but I have lost my ability to be surprised by the things that come out of these candidates' mouths. I am fully prepared to hear Santorum refer to Obama as the anti-Christ, only to be one-upped the next day by someone calling Obama the super-duper, most evil anti-Christ ever -- fo' real. It's juvenile. It's stupid. But apparently it's the way this field has chosen to play. Which is why in the eyes of many, they have already lost the game. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson says GOP candidates are falling over each other to pander to base .

"(CNN) -- My mother and stepfather both held full-time jobs and it wasn't unusual for them to work overtime. Sometimes days would go by when I wouldn't see my stepfather because he was working a double shift on consecutive days. And yet, despite all their hard work, my family struggled to make ends meet. Sometimes I would have to hurry home to get my homework done before nightfall and an unpaid electric bill put the house in the dark. We depended on the cinder blocks of cheese, powdered milk and canned meats encased in saturated fat that the government distributed. School clothes shopping typically began and ended at Goodwill. None of this was unusual in my neighborhood on the east side of Detroit, so I didn't know then what I know now. We were poor. My friends were poor. My cousins who lived nearby were poor. Most everyone I encountered on my block was poor. True, a few of them were lazy and leaned too heavily on the welfare system, while others turned to crime to survive. The first time I was mugged I was in elementary school. And yes, by saying ""the first time,"" I am also saying it was not the only time. But most adults were like my folks. They were sacrificing, hardworking people who wanted one thing: a better life. Better for themselves, better for their children. My story is very similar to that of my partner, whose mother worked hard to feed him and his sister, and that meant peanut butter and jelly sandwiches everyday. Our stories are similar to that of Starbucks president Howard Schultz who grew up in the projects in Brooklyn and whose father never made more than $20,000 a year, or to that of William Jefferson Clinton, who started off as a poor kid from Arkansas and 46 years later was in the White House. It is because of all of this that when I think of what it means to be poor in this country, I don't see a bunch of parasites looking for tax-subsidized handouts. I see hardworking people who could use a helping hand. I see my mother, who to this day shops at the Goodwill, even though her children can now buy her clothes whenever she wants. None of us is rich, but we are the fruit of her years of nonstop labor and inherited the work ethic we saw all around us. And if you scan through the biographies of some of this nation's greatest success stories across every conceivable demographic, you will find people with humble beginnings like mine. Perhaps you yourself came from little. But more important, some people start from humble beginnings and die that way, which is no indication of how hard they did or didn't work, or how good or bad a person they were. As we begin the painful work of tightening the belt of a nation that has gotten fat on credit, it is important that we don't forget: Those stories are the reason we are such a great nation. The middle class doesn't comprise a bunch of affluent people who fell on hard times, but is made up of children and grandchildren of poor people who busted their ass to pull their families up. Newt Gingrich and others say the work ethic is absent in neighborhoods like the one I grew up in. That's just wrong. Gingrich and his like have their collective noses too high up in the air to see this country isn't great in spite of the poor. It is great because of the poor. I'm not saying that the richest country in the world should celebrate millions of her children going to bed hungry each night. But it should celebrate that so many of these children make it out of poverty and reach back to help those behind. They remember what it is like to be hungry. To be cold. To only be recognized for what they don't have, if they are recognized at all. I was walking along the boardwalk in Santa Monica, California, this past weekend enjoying the view of the ocean, while pretending I didn't see the homeless people lying on the beach. How ironic to be in southern California to attend ""CNN Heroes"" and too afraid to look another human being in the eye. Growing up, I didn't do that. Now that I have a little money in my pocket to make donations and the luxury of time so I can volunteer, I rationalize that I am doing my part. And in a way, maybe I am. But that should not excuse me, excuse us from having enough decency to simply look another person in the eye. Or to remember there are faces behind the issues of unemployment benefits and Medicare. To remember with 14 million people looking for work, compassion is our greatest weapon against despair. When you hear politicians talk about deficits, it's all about finances. But culturally we seem to be in an deficit of empathy as well. We have equated the American Dream with being rich, and now that resources are scarce, the rhetoric has a ""kill or be killed"" tone to it. When I was growing up in Detroit, it never occurred to me to equate a person's net worth with his or her worth as a person, or look at it as a snapshot of a value system. No one around me did. That's because we saw so many people working hard for a better life. With that as your backdrop, it is hard to see poor as a four-letter word. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson didn't know it growing up, but his family and neighborhood were poor .

"(CNN) -- I had been wrestling with eye redness for weeks. After trying nearly every brand of over-the-counter eyedrops available, I finally decided to see a doctor. A handful of tests later, the doctor told me he had no idea why my eyes were red. But that didn't stop him from giving me a prescription. It was odd he would assign a treatment without a diagnosis, but what choice did I have? Visine was not getting this red out, and well, he is a doctor. So I paid the co-pay and bought the prescription. After it ran out and I still had red eyes, I went to visit another doctor. He also ran a couple of tests. He also had no idea why my eyes were red. He also gave me a prescription. Hundreds of dollars spent, and yet I still have no answers or clearer eyes. But I do have an appointment with a third doctor and an allergist. I'm not sharing this story to complain. I'm sharing because if you know the average American makes only $33,000 a year -- which, adjusted for inflation, has not changed since 1988 -- or if you know the price of COBRA for a family of four, then you also know why a lot of Americans don't even bother to get on this hamster wheel. They can't afford to do it. Medicine is not an exact science; I get that. But what I don't get is what middle-class and working-poor people are supposed to do as they ricochet helplessly between doctors without getting answers -- like pinballs in a business model that thrives on people trying to find out what's wrong. How do you keep from getting cynical when you know managing an illness is more profitable than curing it or that leaner cuts of meat and organic produce are more expensive than fattier cuts and produce sprayed with chemicals? Nearly one in four children in the United States lives in poverty, and the World Health Organization reports a direct correlation between socioeconomic status and health. So why is the conversation about health, and specifically, health care reform, so toxic? And so politicized? President Theodore Roosevelt said, ""No country can be strong whose people are poor and sick."" Yet the promise each GOP candidate has made is to repeal what he or she calls ""Obamacare,"" with no alternative. Are we meant to pretend the impetus behind the law no longer exists because there's a new sheriff in town? To even call health care reform ""Obamacare"" redirects the conversation away from the most important point: The correlation between socioeconomic status and the mortality rate. Obama doesn't need health care. He and his wife ,Michelle, and their children have access to the best health care on the planet. The same is true for his well-heeled challengers, such as Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry, Herman Cain and Mitt Romney, as well as many of the people in Congress who are fortunate enough to be in the top 10 % of the nation's earners. They all have access to outstanding health care. But what about you? When was the last time you've been to the dentist? You see, despite the rhetoric, the need for health care reform was not discovered by President Barack Obama in 2009. It did not come from Hillary Clinton in 1992. Each president, going back as far as Teddy Roosevelt, has talked about the need to address access to and administration of health care. They understood a healthy population is the lifeblood of a country. Any politician who is touting repeal without offering something significant in its place is not only incapable of connecting the dots, but is out of touch with the kind of sacrifices people make in their health decisions every day. Things such as ignoring reoccurring pains and unusual growths because they can't afford the doctor visit or even the prescription co-pay. This week, CBS' ""60 Minutes"" aired a riveting story about homeless families living in cars in central Florida. One untouched topic was the health of the parents. I wondered what would happen to those children if their parents were to succumb to an illness? Would they end up in the state system? If so, who do you think pays for that? It's all connected, and a true leader sees that. Mississippi is the the poorest state in the country. It is also the unhealthiest. Most of the 10 poorest states are among the 10 unhealthiest states. They also tend to vote Republican. Don't get mad at me; I'm just the messenger. The question is: What are GOP candidates saying when they promise to repeal health care reform but are silent on health care and poverty? The health care reform plan is not perfect. But the Constitution wasn't perfect either, which is why we have amendments. The best thing for the national dialogue is to point out what's good about the plan so we have something to build on. In nearly 80 years of the White House talking about health care reform, we finally have something. And we need it. Promising to repeal the whole thing might be good for the polls, but what does it do for the people? Because I can promise you, any new president who repeals the law will still have access to the best health care available. That is not true for all of the people who voted that president in. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: If you're a politician, you are assured of good health care .

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- As the rallies for Trayvon Martin grow, as the media coverage surrounding the tragedy deepens and as the calls for justice get louder, we all must remember one thing: Revenge and justice are not the same thing. The $10,000 bounty issued by the New Black Panther Party for the capture of Trayvon's shooter, George Zimmerman, might feel justified given what we know of the shooting death. But it is not a call for justice. It is a call for revenge. When the group's leader, Mikhail Muhammad, calls for ""an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,"" it is a call for revenge. Muhammad's words at a rally -- ""If the government won't do the job, we'll do it"" -- might feel empowering, might feel good. But that sentiment flies in the face of every call for justice that was made as well at that rally. Anyone who is considering taking Muhammad up on his offer, or even embarking on a solitary journey of revenge should, to quote the Chinese philosopher Confucius, ""dig two graves.""Â . Nothing good can come from a bunch of vigilantes hunting down and possibly harming another vigilante, regardless of how noble the motivation for doing so may appear on the surface. As angry as I am, and as many of you are, what Muhammad is proposing can only make a bad situation worse. He needs to retract the bounty proposal immediately. Enough violence, and images of violence, surround this tragedy already. A ""war"" on stereotypes. The ""fight"" against racism. It feels as if we can't even discuss the issue of race as it relates to the Martin case without using words that are linked to violence. Nothing about the word ""war"" connotes healing. Very little about a bounty suggests togetherness. I'm not just splitting hairs over semantics. It is science that suggests the words we use shape the way we think. And what we think is the precursor to what we do. If we continue to allow words of conflict to define the conversation about race and racial profiling, then I fear we will move on from this tragedy having learned absolutely nothing, like so many times before. I know many people think of Martin as a modern-day Emmett Till, the 14-year-old black kid from Chicago who was kidnapped and killed by a pair of racist white men in Mississippi in 1955. I tend to see Martin as the new Ryan White, the young man who was diagnosed with AIDS in 1984 at the age of 13. Before White's story, the disease was in the public's peripheral vision, truly discussed only by people who experienced its impact. But once a young, innocent face became associated with AIDS, the country's attitude changed and we began addressing it more effectively. Â . Opinion:Trayvon's killing and Florida's tragic past . Similarly, racial profiling was something only those directly affected would talk about. But the Martin tragedy has the potential to change that -- if we let it. Earlier this week, Will Cain and I were guests of Don Lemon's on CNN and quickly found ourselves in a heated discussion about whether it was appropriate for President Barack Obama to comment on the tragedy. Over the next eight minutes, we fought and argued over issues of race and racial profiling. We continued the conversation once the TV segment was over. We talked on the way to the CNN makeup room. We talked as we left the building, crossed the street and had a beer. My point is, we talked -- not in an effort to fight but to understand each other. To build something. We're hardly the perfect example of race relations. In fact, both of us are constantly told via Twitter, Facebook and other social media just how racist we are. But we try to take each criticism with a grain of salt, understanding that at the end of the day, we're just a couple of men, a couple of fathers who want the same thing: a better world for our kids. And I tend to believe we're not the only ones. But we don't get to that place through revenge, because revenge is cyclical and gets us nowhere. No, we get to that better world for our kids by walking the long linear line of justice, side by side, picking each other up when one falls, reaching a hand back when one gets tired, never forgetting that no matter how divergent our opinions might be from time to time, we're in this thing together.

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- There isn't a question that's more quintessentially American than ""What do you do for a living?"" It is just safe enough to start a conversation with a stranger, it is universal enough so anyone can answer, and it strikes right to the core of what our culture values most -- money. Sure, on the surface that question doesn't sound as if it's been ripped from the Gordon Gekko ""greed is good"" manifesto -- but the reality is it blows past the pleasantries and heads right into the grit of someone's finances, revealing their place in the pecking order of society and thus a glimpse into just how happy they may or may not be. Since the end of the 20th century, ""What do you do for a living?"" has ceased to be an inquiry about how someone spends their time during normal business hours and instead serves as a slightly grating, socially acceptable manner in which we remind each other of the stuff we don't have or will never get. We may understand that money does not buy happiness, but over the past few decades that notion has been competing against a message that at every turn tells us we can't be happy without it. This dichotomy has slowly disconnected the American dream from the idea of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and attached it to one's ability to move up the ladder. If you're at a bar and someone's response to that question is ""I'm a lawyer,"" the people around generally assume that individual makes a lot of money, drives a fancy car and is not living paycheck to paycheck. He or she is happy, if you will. Obviously this is not the same rosy outlook people have about someone who says ""I work at McDonald's"" -- if the person who is working in McDonald's actually even says so. That's not meant to slight people who work in the fast food industry, but to illustrate my point. In our culture a person's worth is tied to his or her profession -- the higher the salary or profile, the more valued the individual is as a person, and the happier we assume he or she is. And sadly the reverse is also true. If it weren't, women would not feel the need to defend their decision to be stay-at-home moms in the era of the career woman. If it weren't, men would not feel challenged if they're dating a woman who makes more. Nowadays, with so many people either out of work or underemployed, I find that question can not only inject a small measure of shame into a conversation, but herd us into faceless categories like job creator or illegal immigrant. There's nothing wrong with trying to pass the time by asking strangers nonthreatening questions. But why not ask about something not related to money, such as ""When was the last time a moment took your breath away?"" -- getting back to what it means to be human as opposed to a consumer. Yes, jobs, career, money are all realities and yes, we've all got to eat. But what's wrong with talking about good food as opposed to what we had to do to pay for it? To me, the impetus behind Occupy Wall Street is not about jobs or failed policies. It's a yearning to be valued again. To be heard and seen. To matter. Some of us are guilty of buying houses we couldn't afford or leaning on credit cards to live above our means. Banks created a business model that profits off of our desire to keep up with the Joneses. Now the rugs been pulled from under us and we're scared. In the title track of his second CD, bluesman Amos Lee sings ""life ain't only supply and demand."" Somewhere between the Atari 2600 and the first iPod, a lot of us have forgotten that. It seems now would be a good time to remember, because regardless of who wins the election in 2012, most economists believe the waters will be choppy for some time after. Unnerving, considering how much we're already at each other's throats. Somehow we have to remember we are more than our credit score. We are more than what we do for a living. We are more than stuff. Last week, in roughly 36 hours, I went from sipping coffee at a Starbucks in a midsized city in Michigan, to ordering overpriced cocktails at a posh hotel lounge in Beverly Hills, to shaking my head disapprovingly as I drove by Confederate flags that still flap in the wind in Jackson, Mississippi. Along the way I found myself engaged in a number of casual conversations with some of my favorite kind of people -- strangers. It would make sense that folks from the Midwest, West Coast and Deep South would have radically different approaches to life -- and in many ways they do -- but what I found amusing was that regardless of the ZIP code, it did not take long for the person I was talking to ask me what I do for a living. In some cases in Beverly Hills, they wanted to know that before they knew my name. It all seemed so callous and fake. Then I remembered ""what you do"" is the new ""who you are."" Now it just all seemed so sad. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson says Americans love to ask strangers: ""What do you do for a living?""

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- On November 8, 1965, 48 American soldiers lost their lives during ""Operation Hump"" after the 400 men of the 173 Airborne Brigade were ambushed by roughly 1,200 Viet Cong fighters. I did not learn about this battle from a history book or teacher in school, but rather a popular country song -- ""The 8th of November"" by the duo Big and Rich. Whenever someone asks me why I love country music, I think of songs like that one, and Tim McGraw's ""If You're Reading This,"" and the Dixie Chicks' ""Traveling Soldier"" -- each with lyrics that capture the toll war has taken on this nation's soul. Now, it would be disingenuous of me to pretend a black guy from Detroit listening to country is the norm. It's not, and I know it. But I'm not trying to be something that I'm not. My family is from rural Mississippi and I spent a lot of my childhood playing on the dirt roads south of Greenwood. I have an uncle who has yet to recover from his time in Vietnam. So I know full well the world many country artists sing about: the watering holes, eating fried chicken, going to church, God, war. When Rodney Atkins sings, ""these are my people"" I think: ""yes they are."" Obsessions: Crazy about country music . So I am excited to see the crossover appeal of acts such as Lady Antebellum and Blake Shelton. I look forward to seeing Wednesday's Country Music Awards. But I will also tell you I am disappointed that so few artists will sing about the one glaring aspect of life in the country that greatly defines how many Americans view the genre -- and that is race. Scan the singles released over recent decades and it's as if race doesn't exist as an issue despite the South, the home of country music, being the backdrop for the beginning of the civil rights movement. How can so many songs, like ""November,"" be written with such great detail about events that happened 40 years ago, in a country thousands of miles away -- and yet we hear hardly a peep about the battles over race and rights that occurred at the same time on the industry's doorstep? About the battles and conversations that are happening around it still? In 2009, country starlet Taylor Swift won the album of the year Grammy for her CD ""Fearless."" It would be encouraging to see more of country's songwriters embrace that word and be just that: fearless. Stop telling an abbreviated, sanitized version of their world while there is video from a surveillance camera in Mississippi showing a black man being beaten and eventually run over by a group of white teens who set out looking to attack the first black person they saw. While a word like ""plantation"" is used to describe the voting practices of black Democrats and ""lynching"" is tossed around regarding the media's treatment of a black Republican. I can understand the hesitation some white artists may have about approaching this subject. They're fearful of saying something offensive and country radio hates controversy (see Chicks, Dixie). But the truth is that not talking about the unpleasant parts of life in the country do not make them go away. It just allows others to tell your story for you. I've met some amazing people in the country music field: Good folks without a racist bone in their body. But they have seen and heard and lived through some disturbing things. They, too, have a point of view, a story. I wish the music would tell it. Not just for the sake of the artists, but for the millions of white Americans who come from small towns, listen to country music and should not be viewed as social pariahs by the rest of the nation because of it. Acknowledging racism does not perpetuate it but rather exposes the disease where it festers and hides. And just as ""The 8th of November"" taught me something about the Vietnam War, country music can remind people not to allow the stereotypical few to unfairly define the whole. In 2004, Kenny Chesney released his CD ""When The Sun Goes Down,"" which included a song called ""Some People Change."" It was never released as a single but the song caught the attention of the duo Montgomery Gentry, who later covered it. The song became a top 10 hit for them in 2006, but not before they massaged the lyrics. Instead of Chesney's original: . His old man was a rebel yeller, . bad boy to the bone, . and say can't trust a color feller, . he judge 'em by the tone of their skin . The duo sang ""you can't trust that other feller,"" softening the language a bit. I'm sure it doesn't seem like a big thing to some, but I know some still refer to blacks as ""colored"" or worse. So while I applaud the group for going as far as they did, I would have preferred they just told the story like it is, with all the warts, gashes, scabs and wounds. After all, racism is ugly. It's OK to say so. It's OK to sing so. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: Country music taught me about war .
He says it's strange that country doesn't tell the story of race and civil rights .

"(CNN) -- This will sound a bit strange, I know, but whenever I walk into a grocery store, I have to decide whether or not I feel like telling the cashier I'm gay. And right now, you're probably thinking: ""Under what circumstances would anyone have to tell the complete stranger at the checkout counter about his sexual orientation?"" I assure you it's not about sex. It's about flowers. I love them. I love smelling them. I love receiving them. I love giving them to my partner. So often when I'm at the grocery store, I'll pick up a dozen roses for him. And then the cashier grabs them off the conveyor belt and, because they're roses, usually says something along the lines of, ""Oh, she's going to love these."" And that, my friends, is why I have to decide whether or not I feel like coming out to a cashier when I go to the store. The assumption is I'm buying the roses for a woman. I'm not. But do I correct the cashier — thus revealing my sexual orientation — or do I just let that person go on with the assumption and, well, in a sense stay in the closet? And before you answer, first ask yourself if your answer would change if I were straight and the cashier said, ""He's going to love those."" This scenario is not a hypothetical. It's just my everyday life. And there are similar moments of everyday life like these that people in the LGBT community have to negotiate all of the time. I'm not sharing my grocery store anxiety to play victim, nor am I trying to somehow make straight people feel guilty. Some of my best friends are straight, and they are fine people. But there is something wrong when a man buying roses for the man in his life becomes a political statement. True, when someone of note comes out of the closet, culturally we're at the point where many of us respond with a great big ""who cares?"" That, in a sense, is progress. But when there are 29 states where people can be fired for no other reason than being gay; when there are 35 states where people can be fired for being transgendered; when 29 states have constitutional amendments banning marriage equality, responding with ""who cares?"" is either naive or disingenuous. Obviously, a lot of people care. Otherwise, folks in Michigan, Texas, Idaho and Florida would not be afraid to lose their jobs if their employer were to learn they were buying roses for their same-sex partner. For those who consider themselves supportive of LGBT rights, perhaps instead of saying ""who cares?"" the more proper response is ""I care."" I care that so many Americans are afraid for their safety for no other reason than who they are. I care that we have laws in place that deny so many Americans the mechanisms they need to take care of their families. I care that right now, there is a young person contemplating taking his or her own life because he or she has been the target of relentless bullying at school, has no support and doesn't see a way out. Thursday — today — is Spirit Day, and organizations such as The Trevor Project, GLSEN and GLAAD — all of which I've been a part of in one capacity or another — are encouraging fair-minded people to wear purple as a way of letting these young, desperate kids know that this country's response to their problems is not ""who cares?"" — it's ""I care."" So many times, the conversation surrounding LGBT rights is framed by the opposition as a movement that is trying to recruit kids, infringe upon religious rights or ram ""gayness"" down people's throats. The reality is that some of us are just buying flowers. Am I oversimplifying the issue? I don't think so. After all, what's complicated about being a decent human being? This week, the nation honored the work and life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during the dedication of his memorial in Washington, D.C. One of my favorite quotes of his is ""in the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends."" The silence of our friends. So many of us know better but choose to be silent for fear of outing ourselves or being ""guilty by association."" As a result, we let the jokes slide, the slurs be said, the punches be thrown. In the meantime, The Trevor Project reports that LGBT youths are four times more likely to commit suicide than their straight counterparts. When I hear the stories or see the numbers, I feel as if I have no choice but to tell the cashier in the store that the roses are for my partner. And he's a dude. Not because I'm parading my sexual orientation around, but because I shouldn't have to apologetically cram my existence into a dark room, not even for the brief moment it takes for me to pay for my groceries and roll my shopping cart out the door. I come out to my cashier not because I need to say it, but because of the possibility that someone in the neighboring aisle needs to hear it, and I will wear purple on Spirit Day in case someone whose path I cross needs to see it. And judging from the numbers, I'm pretty sure someone does.

"(CNN) -- Speak to an agent. After ""can you hear me now?"" is there a more frustrating phrase we have to yell into our cells over and over again than that? It's so bad that I find myself adding words like ""please"" and sometimes ""dammit"" even though I know it's only going to confuse the automated service more but I can't help it because the process is slowly driving me insane. It's either that or I start pushing the pound key as soon as I hear a robotic voice on the other end, which of course doesn't work either because companies have figured out that we have figured out the shortcut. Consequently the companies have either eliminated the pound key option or force you to listen to the entire message because it's only at the end do you hear ""or push 4 to speak to an agent."" Four. Why is four the new pound key and what in the hell happened to zero? And why do we need to punch in our account number before we speak to an agent if the agent is only going to ask for our account number when he or she finally gets on the phone anyway? It just seems like busy work and obviously we're busy enough. That's why we forgot to send a check to the cable company and now we have to call to pay the bill in first place. OK, maybe that last part is just me. But what isn't ""just me"" is the irritation that comes from knowing these cable providers, banks, doctor offices and such have all taken what has traditionally been a fairly painless process and injected all of this stress into it because automated service seems easier on the bottom line than customer service. I get it. Siri and her girls may not get the caller's request right the first dozen times, but they don't require overtime, health insurance or raises. I guess it wasn't enough that outsourcing funneled our calls out of the country and into offices in countries where the people on the other end of the phone only knew the English on the script in front of them. Now, not only do the people answering the phone not know English, they're not even people. They're software. Correction: It's software. In fact you can buy groceries, pay for tolls, get tickets to movies and such and go for days dealing only with ""it"" and never ""they"" or ""them"" or ""him"" or ""her."" It would appear our growing usage and dependence on technology has not only made us lazier but so much more impersonal. My 15-year-old son actually tried to text me while in the next room of our house one night. I stormed right over and said, ""Young man you will tell me I am ruining your life to my face"" ... or something like that. The world has gotten so crazy that some companies are now promoting the fact that you can call their customer service department and an agent will answer the phone. What used to be a given is now considered an innovative promotion that I'm sure we're paying for with some hidden charge dubbed a ""processing fee"" or something like that. I remember seeing a recent CNN news segment in which a pastor encourages people to tweet while in his church. Imagine: the message from an infinite God filed down to 140 characters or less, which I guess is just as good as long as you have enough bars on your phone. And you don't have to speak to an agent before the church service starts because you forgot to pay your bill (again, that last part may just be me). Technology is great most of the time but not all of the time. While living in an automated world can certainly expedite a lot in our lives, it can also cause us to fly by some of the smaller things we don't notice until they're gone. Like arcades, telephone booths or the ability to speak to a freaking agent. I swear I never noticed just how important that part of life was until I started yelling that sentence into my cell in public. Now it seems whenever I dial a phone that's all I want to do: Speak to an agent, pay my bills, go back to not having to be bothered with ... people.

"(CNN) -- I don't know if it's sexism or wisdom or just plain fear, but men have been socialized to avoid saying two words in the presence of women. The first is ""fat."" I know I don't go there. And I don't see a good reason why any man should. When women use the word around me I pretend not to hear it, and if asked a question with the word ""fat"" in it, I sneeze in my hand and then ask for a tissue. Juvenile, yes, but it allows me to change the subject without having to answer the question. And I don't ever want to answer that question. Speaking of questions, the second word we should all stay away from is ""weave."" I don't care if a man sees a woman bald at the office on Wednesday, with blond finger waves at the club on Friday, and with jet black hair down to her butt at church on Sunday -- if anyone asks if she wears a weave, the answer is ""I don't know."" She could be holding a receipt from Weaves R Us in one hand, and five pounds of hair in the other, and he should say ""I'm not sure."" At the salon where I get my dreadlocks retwisted, every third woman walks in with a bag of hair. I keep my head down, eyes closed and try not to breathe. I want to be as invisible as possible, because the last thing I want is for a woman in there to think I'm aware of her lace-front, glued-in, braided back or whatever it is she's got going on up there. And every man I know harbors that same level of sexism/wisdom/fear. Which is why I had to talk to Blaine Stewart, who was not only brave and/or stupid enough to bring up his co-worker's weave -- he did it right in front of her face. On live TV. Stewart and Laila Muhammad host the morning show for WGNT in Norfolk, Virginia. During the Halloween broadcast, Stewart blew out the candle inside the jack-o'-lantern sitting on the desk. Muhammad joked that if the smoke from the candle set off the studio sprinkler system, ""I'm done for the day."" ""Sitting up here looking like a mop,"" she said. That's when my main man Stewart chimed in, ""You do not want a sprinkler system and a beautiful weave, because they do not go together."" Right now you're probably thinking: Oh no he didn't. And I'm here to tell you: Oh yes he did. And even as Muhammad stared at him with her mouth hanging open and a high-pitched wail filling the room, poor Stewart went on to say ""You said it was a weave -- right?"" I hadn't laughed that hard at a YouTube clip since Antoine Dodson told us to hide our kids. And sites such as YBF and Lipstick Alley had a field day. ""I knew the first rule about not talking about fat, but I didn't know the second,"" he said. ""No one told me about the second."" Which is why I had to write this column, in an effort to save lives this holiday season. Men, I don't care if half of her track is dangling in a pot of black-eyed peas, you do not acknowledge that weave. You sneeze in your hand and go to the bathroom and pray that an aunt, a cousin, someone has told her by the time you get out. Now, Muhammad and Stewart are great friends, and their rapport plays well on camera -- even while ""weave-gate"" was unfolding. The two even put out a follow-up to try to add more context to the story. Stewart, who is bald, said the two actually talk about weaves on the show quite a bit, something he attributes to his latent hair envy. Muhammad said the fact that she wears a weave is not a secret at the studio. She actually has long hair that isn't permed, but she chooses to wear a weave because daily exposure to the heat from the studio lights can damage hair. But Muhammad said while she was comfortable with Stewart and others knowing, she was shocked ""he put all of my business out there like that."" ""I wasn't mad at him -- but he clearly didn't know the rule,"" she said, laughing. ""No, I didn't run to HR. No, I didn't beat him up off set. No, I didn't have to explain my blackness to him afterwards. It was clear he was trying to make a compliment. ... He didn't mean to call me out."" But that didn't stop some people from drawing a different, less forgiving conclusion. ""I was a little surprised by some of the pretty harsh things people said about me,"" Stewart said. ""I don't believe I'm a racist or a white devil or a bitchy queen as some people have posted about me. I just wasn't thinking. ""But it's funny, we can talk about fake eyelashes, lip gloss, makeup and all of the other enhancements that we do, but when it comes to hair, we keep quiet. It's the last taboo."" That's when I stepped in and reminded Stewart that while ""weave-gate"" was bad, hair is not the last taboo. And if he didn't believe me, he should try bringing up the word ""fat"" and see what happens. Of course, I won't do it. I know the rules. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson says there are a couple of words men should avoid when talking with women .

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- If you haven't heard the audio clip of high school football coach Shawn Abel going off, you need to take two minutes out of your life to do so. It is classic. Dude is yelling and screaming and you can hear stuff being banged around, and I don't believe any actor outside of maybe Samuel L. Jackson could come close to re-enacting the level of passion that is wrapped around each curse word that comes flying out of this man's mouth. It is ^%$^&!! unbelievable. But based on that clip -- and the fact Abel is smart enough to teach A.P. precalculus -- if my son played football at Collierville, I would be perfectly fine with him having Abel as his coach. Unfortunately Coach Abel resigned this week because, well, this audio clip exists. Some of the players secretly recorded Abel's pregame speech, and one of them posted it on YouTube. The actions of the players make me more upset than Abel's rant. Coach was ticked because they weren't playing together as a team. What kind of player leaks his coach's speech to the press? A selfish one, thus proving his point. While I'm sure it was uncomfortable for some of the players to sit through, I didn't hear anything that was offensive. He cursed, he yelled. Big deal. It's football, not Sesame Street. If this is his only offense, the community should rally around the coach, encourage him to come back and tell the high school players to toughen up. They should not punish a man who has poured 25 years of his life into the community or someone who cares so much he talks about being a Collierville Dragon with pride. Obviously if he's been a teacher at the school for this many years, he clearly understands the difference between the field and the classroom, otherwise he would have been fired for going the ^%^%* off years ago. There is certainly language that I think is unacceptable under any circumstances, but I didn't hear any of that on the clip. He didn't use any slurs; he didn't threaten a player's safety; he didn't call the players anything other than apathetic and selfish. In some ways, it was one of the most respectful undressings I've ever heard. Since the story broke, there's been a Facebook page established to show support. I've also seen anonymous quotes from Collierville players characterizing Abel as a ""psycho"" and noting that wasn't his first rant. And I'm sure it wasn't, given they had lost four of five games and need to win Friday to make the playoffs. But funny, I didn't see any quotes that denied Abel's assessment of the team's playing or their commitment to hard work. It was as if the players knew they weren't playing up to their potential. They just didn't like the way the coach said it. And having been around sports my entire adult life, I can tell you a lot of athletes -- on every level -- do not like it when a coach points out their faults. There is a line, but Abel didn't cross it. There are some places in life where boo boos are met with a hug. The locker room is not one of them. Near my home there is a gymnastics school, and plastered on the wall facing the highway it reads ""Every child is a champion."" Each time I drive by, I just want to pull over, run inside and tell the kids the truth. ""Little Johnny, Little David, Mitch... these people are lying to you -- only one of you can be a champion. They don't hand out three gold medals... See you later."" We are so obsessed with shielding kids from disappointment and discomfort that they have no idea how to deal with life when they leave the nest. That's not parenting, that's crippling. Abel's speech may have been shocking, but it may also have been the best thing to have happened to a kid in that locker room because it placed him in a highly stressful, highly confrontational situation, and the kid learned he can handle it. I can hear parents now saying, ""But this is just high school,"" to which I say, yes it is, and Abel was trying to teach his players something. I hope they reinstate him as coach so he can finish the lesson.

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- Almost as soon as it was announced that Barack Obama had defeated John McCain in the 2008 general election, most pundits -- and voters, for that matter -- assumed Sarah Palin would be the president's opponent in 2012. And why not? She didn't just breathe life into McCain's campaign but into the entire Republican Party. Up until then, the GOP was about as hip as a dot matrix printer. Palin represented a brand of conservative politics that was Twitterable and has since been instrumental in the rise of the tea party. She is charismatic. She is beautiful. She is a leader. And in the view of many people, particularly liberals, she's also a bit of an idiot. A botched Katie Couric interview here, a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit there, and since breaking into the national scene, countless gaffes and misstatements. And yet despite it all, her popularity remains relatively high, particularly among conservatives. Recent polls all show the majority in her party do not want her to run, but those surveys do not mean people, her people, do not love her. So when she announced Wednesday she was not running for the 2012 presidency, I'm sure quite a few of her supporters were extremely disappointed. That wasn't my reaction. I smiled, thinking Palin isn't dumb at all. In fact, she's pretty smart. ""My decision is based upon a review of what common-sense conservatives and independents have accomplished, especially over the last year,"" her official statement read. ""I believe that at this time I can be more effective in a decisive role to help elect other true public servants to office -- from the nation's governors to congressional seats and the presidency."" In other words, she can continue to influence national politics without having to be responsible for actually making a decision. She can criticize with a broad brush without the burden of contextualizing her statements with detailed, alternate solutions. She's like a performance artist whose opinions are rarely second-guessed, whose tongue is rarely censored. She's rich and famous and essentially has no one to answer to. Her persona is so mesmerizing that her daughter Bristol, a mother at 18, gets paid to talk about abstinence. We should all be as dumb as Sarah Palin. Seriously, why would she stop doing what she is doing to seek a thankless job, that pays poorly for the work that it requires? Why turn her back on a public life with little accountability to campaign for a public life in which every decision will be scrutinized. Politicized. Criticized. Obama swatted a fly on television one day back in 2009. The next day, PETA issued a statement asking him to be more humane to animals. Why would anyone leave a world of hunting moose to enter a world in which killing a fly is worthy of a press release? It just doesn't make sense. Palin's critics will say she didn't run because she knew she would lose. I say she didn't run because of the chance she would win. Palin has been around the political scene enough to know it's a whole lot easier flirting with running for president of the United States than it is being president of the United States. That's especially true today, thanks in part to her. You have a better chance of seeing a herd of unicorns grazing in front of the Washington Monument than drama-free bipartisanship in the halls of Congress. Obama's under fire for a slumping U.S. economy as if he pointed it south or as if the rest of the planet is on solid financial footing. But Palin, who prides herself on being in touch with the heartland, knows Americans are typically not interested in those kind of sausage-making details. They just want to eat. So despite the fact it took decades for the country to create the environment that allowed millions of jobs to be ushered out the door, the honeymoon for a new face to turn everything around will be extremely short. In fact, whoever is elected president in the fall of 2012 will probably be raked across the coals for the high unemployment rate by spring of 2013. This is why Palin probably decided not to run for president months ago -- she was smart enough to know that while she can move the needle and copies of her book, the economy is a whole other beast. And dumping Alaska under the guise of ""not putting Alaskans through that"" -- as she said in her resignation speech as governor -- worked on the state level, Palin would certainly lose every supporter she has if she tried to walk away from the White House in similar fashion. When you're loved by so many unconditionally, why risk being hated by everyone for no reason at all? It just doesn't make sense. Bashing Palin's intellect may be a hobby for some people, but in saying no to the White House, she showed once and for all, she's no fool. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: After John McCain's loss, many assumed Sarah Palin would run in 2012 .

And in their latest linguistic sleight of hand, the modern-day Houdinis have managed to turn ""stimulus"" into a four-letter word. Or at least a word President Barack Obama no longer feels comfortable saying. In 2009, he couldn't say it enough. Now ... well, I didn't hear it once during his jobs speech last week, even though $447 billion in tax cuts and government spending would certainly qualify as being one. But the president and his administration can avoid whatever word they choose in describing the jobs bill; that's not going to change what Republicans say about it: . ""With the president traveling the country touting his Stimulus II plan, it is important to understand the lessons from his first stimulus,"" Republican National Committee Reince Priebus said. ""I suspect I am not the only American asking, if a trillion dollars' worth of stimulus didn't work, why will another $450 billion do the trick?"" former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson asked. ""He had $800 billion worth of stimulus in the first round of stimulus. It created zero jobs, $400-plus billion in this package. And I can do the math on that one. Half of zero jobs is going to be zero jobs,"" said Texas Gov. Rick Perry. As usual, Republicans are dictating the conversation, this time massaging their response to the president's jobs bill to support their assertion that his $787 billion stimulus package was a failure. And each day Obama avoids saying the word, he inadvertently gives their claims credibility by appearing to distance himself from his initiative. Instead of using equivocal language, the president just needs to reclaim the word ""stimulus."" And he needs to do it now as he tries to sell his jobs bill to the public. After all, it's not like anyone's forgotten the word or the 2009 measure he pushed through Congress. Might as well talk about its successes and shortcomings while trying to help out-of-work Americans, as opposed to being forced to do so in the general election, where such talk will be interpreted as simply trying to help himself. Besides, the truth is the administration's projections were overly optimistic and failed to meet the president's own mark of keeping the unemployment rate under 8%. Not to mention by its very spending structure, the impact of the stimulus package was not even designed to be felt by the majority of Americans quickly, which may have been wise fiscally but not so politically. However, even with all of that, for anyone to characterize the stimulus package as a complete failure means he or she either had no idea just how bad the country's economy was or they're just parroting partisan talking points. (Between May 1999 and May 2009, private-sector jobs increased by just 1.1%, the lowest 10-year period since the Depression.) And I can't help but notice how the chatty Republicans' tongues are tied when it comes to mentioning the 750,000 jobs that were lost on average in the first three months of 2009, during which the stimulus took effect and how that number declined to 35,000 by the beginning of 2010? And am I the only one who finds it strange that Republican leadership wants to deem the stimulus a failure but fails to mention the studies performed by economists across the political spectrum that credit the stimulus for staving off a depression. And then there's front-runner Perry calling the president's stimulus package a failure during Monday's debate while not mentioning how he used $6 billion from the first ""failed"" stimulus package to balance his state's budget. Not sure what they call that in Texas, but in the Midwest we call that hypocrisy. Maybe I'm just being silly for letting the facts get in the way of a good campaign slogan. Perhaps I'm a bit naive to think the GOP should actually point out the stimulus pros with the cons in hopes of finding a more perfect solution to the country's economic woes. In any case, it seems Obama's strategy of trying to pass a jobs stimulus package without saying the word ""stimulus"" just makes talking about the bill more difficult than it has to be. And if he continues to let undecided voters believe the first stimulus package was unsuccessful, what's their motivation for getting behind him and pressuring their representatives to pass the second? Or even vote for him? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: President Obama proposes jobs bill but avoids word ""stimulus""

"(CNN) -- The sign at the airport was so ridiculous, I thought it was a joke. ""Please be advised, snow globes are not allowed through the security checkpoint,"" it read. That was followed by an image of a snow globe with a Christmas tree on the inside and one of those big red ""not allowed"" lines going through the middle. Underneath the picture read: ""Your safety is our priority."" Apparently, this ban has been around for a while, but I guess I was too busy taking my shoes and belt off to notice. Over the years, Transportation Security Administration officials have taken away my deodorant, my toothpaste, even my nose hair trimmer in the name of safety. Now it seems as if they are going after Christmas -- one snow globe at a time. To be fair, I can see some reason for their caution. After all, the liquid in a normal snow globe could be replaced with something dangerous. And at a time in which an al Qaeda operative is on trial for trying to blow up a plane by igniting explosives sewn inside his underwear, there doesn't appear to be a limit as to how far our enemies will go to harm us. But on the other, we're so wildly inconsistent with airport safety protocol, how could someone look at a ""No Snow Globe"" sign and not laugh? A couple of weeks ago, I had an agent ask to frisk my dreadlocks because the scanner read it as an ""anomaly."" I argued, and the eventual compromise was having me whip my hair around like a Vegas showgirl until the guy with the rubber gloves was convinced I wasn't carrying a bomb in my hair. Then he groped me ... just in case I had any dignity left. My encounter was similar to the one experienced by a Dallas woman who last month had her Afro frisked by airport security in Atlanta. Billions of taxpayer dollars invested to make us safe, and the TSA is on the lookout for big hair. If this were the '80s, everybody would miss their flight. Meanwhile, I see pilots and flight attendants walking through the metal detector, untouched, with their shoes on. Why bother making them walk through metal detectors at all if they're not going to be fondled or checked for shoe bombs like the rest of us? And if you can answer that, maybe you can explain why we are given plastic knives and forks to eat with in airport restaurants, but metal knives and forks are handed to us in first class? Are terrorists only flying coach? Are policy makers incapable of connecting the dots? Or are these mindless exercises in place to mask the reality that we are not only incapable of completely safeguarding ourselves against another terrorist attack but that our government is too dysfunctional to even approve what can be done? Did you know that one of the factors that led to more deaths on the morning of September 11 is that New York police and fire departments did not have a way to communicate with each other? Ten years later, there still isn't a nationwide first responder network in place because of the bureaucracy in Washington. Face it: The question isn't whether we'll be attacked again but when and how. Afro-frisking and snow globe-grabbing are just placebos given to an incurable patient. But they do make us laugh. And laughter's a pretty good medicine in its own right. Like the glass case in the Atlanta airport that displays items you can't bring aboard, one of them a chainsaw, in case you were packing a chainsaw as your carry-on. And I can't tell you how many times I've glanced over at the emergency exit row and thought: If we're forced to have a water landing, we're all as good as dead. That's because I've seen skinny models who need help getting their carry-on into the overhead compartment manning the exit nearest to me. I've seen the barely mobile elderly sitting in the exit row. Last week, the nation openly asked whether New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was too fat to be president. I'm OK with him being president. I wonder if people his size are normally fit enough to be sitting in the freaking exit row. Given the physical requirements and inherent importance of an exit row seat, I would feel more comfortable if I knew the person sitting there could at least do a pushup and not just be collecting a reward for being a repeat customer. These are the kind of systematic disconnects that just crack me up. Flight attendants tell us to turn off all electronic devices under the guise they could interfere with the plane's navigation system, meaning that if the terrorists really wanted to cause some damage, all they had to do was read their Kindle during takeoff. But hey, at least we're getting a handle on snow globes. After I got done staring at the sign, I took a picture of it and posted it on my Facebook wall so my friends could also enjoy the laugh. And as the cynical comments came pouring in, I smiled, temporarily forgetting that I live in a world where shoes are a threat, afros can be dangerous, and someone tried to blow up a plane with their underwear.

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- The number one song on Billboard's R&B/Hip Hop charts this week is a romantic little ditty called ""Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay"". In it, Big Sean refers to the object of his affection as ""my bitch"" while Kanye West boasts that his girl is cool because she performs oral sex while wearing shades. Again, this is the most popular song on black radio right now. So now I ask you: How do we begin to criticize what President Obama has or has not done for the black community when lyrics like these are acceptable? How can we dismiss Herman Cain as a sell-out for calling black people ""brainwashed"" when the hottest song on the radio encourages men to treat women like receptacles? How do we wave an angry finger at what Governor Rick Perry's rock may or may not have said 20 years ago while something like ""Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay"" is happening right in front of our faces, in real time? Perry's ""Niggerhead"" revelation is disturbing but if the controversy forces him out of the race tomorrow, life for black America would not be changed. Our unemployment rate would still be twice the national average, we'll still be disproportionately living in poverty, we'll still be lagging behind in education. So despite the kind of 24-hour sexiness that usually accompanies an n-word scandal like this one, the truth is that it is not the real story. It never is. The real story is if the black community doesn't find a way to heal ourselves from these self-inflicted wounds, there won't be much of a black community left for people like Perry to offend. Just this summer there was a report published in the Annals of Epidemiology that concluded black men have a 50 percent chance to live longer in prison than out of it. Nationwide cuts in K-12 education are expected to total over $4 billion this year and last, with low-income and minority students being impacted the most. This fall there was a book released that flatly asks ""Is Marriage for White People?"" The black community is in a crisis; being hit hard from a variety of cultural and socio-economic angles and we're talking about rocks. Each time a Perry or any other white person in the media finds themselves engulfed in an ""n-word"" controversy, instead of resting in our offense, the black community needs to view it as an opportunity to do some much needed soul searching about that word, and the disempowering mentality attached to it. Talk about it in church. In the beauty salon. At school. We have to move away from the bulk of our attention trying to determine if a white person is racist or not because news cycles move fast and we really need to stay focused on the real story. Trust me: next week somebody would have slept with someone they weren't supposed to and we'll forget all about Perry's rock. But as a community, we'll still be hurting ourselves. Sure we can point to the Washington Post story as evidence that racism does in fact exist within the upper echelon of the GOP and that Cain--who has always openly criticized this notion--is a jackass. But then what? How does that move us forward? It doesn't. Besides during the time in which the rock reportedly had the n-word painted on it, Perry was a Democrat, not a Republican-- so was he a racist friend or is he now an inclusive foe? And how do we reconcile the rock with the bill he signed that helps children of undocumented immigrants pay for college? You know, there once was another governor of Texas, Ann Richards, who, in criticizing her opponent--George W. Bush-- said his problem was that he was born on third base but he thought he hit a triple. I would say the black community's problem is that we're standing at the plate but so many of us behave as if we still can't get in the game. We're waiting for our number to be called while pitch after pitch after pitch goes by. Yes, systematic racism and the vortex of poverty have contributed mightily to what ails us today. But do we really need Obama to draw up a federal program that tells men to stick around and raise their kids? Would a President Perry or dare I say President Cain somehow impede our ability to pull up our pants? Treat our women with respect? It seems we never have a problem rejecting the hurtful things said about or done to us by others, but remain somewhat oblivious to how the hurtful things we say and do to each other contributes to our overall decay. The news about the Perrys' hunting ground serves as a reminder that we're hardly in a post-racial society. But ""Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay"" is the number one song in urban America right now. I don't see how the n-word painted on a rock 20 years ago hurts us worse than that.

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- I am a big-time news junkie but there are days in which I don't turn on the television because I don't want to find out who's next. The next to fall. The next to be torn down. The next to have their nice and shiny public persona ripped apart, doused with gas and set on fire -- done in by the always lethal combination of private shortcomings and stupidity. Or arrogance. Or whatever it is that makes politicians and other public figures believe ""no one is going to find out."" But we do find out, don't we? If you cheat on your spouse -- the mistress talks. Take a bribe -- there's a receipt. Whisper something offensive under your breath, in your car -- alone -- with the windows down and the radio up and somehow, someway there's an audible clip of it posted on YouTube. And so I have my days when I try to avoid the news. I don't blame reporters for doing their job. Only people running for office tend to do that. Rather there are days I don't need to be told about this new kind of America we're living in. The kind without gods or role models. The kind without heroes. You remember that Tina Turner song that said we didn't need another one of those? Well at times, today's 24-hour news cycle can be a callous reminder that we never really had heroes in the first place. We were just blissfully ignorant. Imagine if TMZ or Twitter was around when Marilyn Monroe was singing to President Kennedy or if smart phones were available to capture video of Mickey Mantle getting drunk in bars and picking up women. Our opinions of those iconic figures would certainly be different. And we wouldn't be behaving as if things have somehow gotten worse. We would know that the country was never as pious as we like to think it was. Each time I hear someone like Pat Buchanan romanticize our past -- as if everyone was living in an episode of ""Happy Days"" -- I throw up in my mouth just a little. Sure our history is peppered with self-sacrificing individuals who did a tremendous amount of good for the whole of society. And if the narrative would just stop there we wouldn't be so troubled to learn about their flaws or the flaws of self-sacrificing people of today. But we don't stop. We worship. And when we find out our gods are not perfect, we're confused. We don't know what to do with a storyline where the perceived protagonist is complex. Heroes aren't supposed to do bad things. That's what villains are for. So either the good supersedes the bad, or the bad makes it impossible to remember the good. We don't like it when such duality exists in one person. We don't want to know our heroes are human. For example, I have two images of the Rev. Jesse Jackson locked in my head. The first is the brave civil rights soldier who risked his life working side by side with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The second is the lowlife who not only brought his pregnant mistress to the White House but posed for pictures with her standing next to President Clinton. What do you do with that kind of duality? You turn off the television. At least for little while. And you try to remember that few people are as good as advertised and even fewer are as bad as rumored. That in the new America, pedestals are best reserved for flowers, not people. Part of the reason why so many people came rushing to Joe Paterno's defense is because the ex-Penn State coach had done so much good for the school and the community. He was supposed to be a man above reproach, born within the shadow of our greatest generation. It is so hard for some to accept the possibility that one of our great heroes could have been involved in something not becoming of the title. And I found that sentiment more shocking than Paterno's connection to the allegations. After all, scandals involving football coaches at big-time schools happen so frequently it was hard for me to imagine anyone being surprised. If a story broke tomorrow that President Obama was cheating on Michelle, I would be disappointed but not surprised. How could I be given the number of stories about politicians having extramarital affairs? I don't believe such an attitude is cynical, just pragmatic. I don't personally know Paterno or Obama. But I do know people can make mistakes. And if we're to ever have public figures to look up to ever again, we have to start allowing for that. Mistakes. Because in the old America, our heroes could be ""perfect"" -- since the public would never find out their flaws. Those kind of stories simply would not be written But in the new America that isn't possible. With technology and social media and citizen journalism, every rock that used to go unturned is now being flipped, lit and put on TV. Which is why sometimes, I just don't turn mine on. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: When our heroes let us down, we're bitterly disappointed .

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- There is a place for people who enjoy soaking in the beautiful colors of fall and all the other amazing scenes of nature as they drive down the open highway. It's called the right lane. If you're sightseeing or rubbernecking in the left, get your butt over. Why is that rule so freakin' hard to follow? As drivers, we do a lot of things that irritate each other. We signal but never turn. We turn but don't signal. We forget who is supposed to go next at a four-way stop sign. But nothing comes close to the level of irritation that comes from being stuck behind someone doing 55 in a 65 in the far left lane. Drive the speed you want, but why infringe on the rights of those in a hurry? To me, that's giving the rest of us on the road the finger in the most passive aggressive -- ""Who me?""-- way possible. In fact, I would much rather have someone pull up beside me, roll down their window and flip me the bird as they go driving by than be trapped behind this vehicular anarchist. And you know they see you. They see all of us -- bobbing and weaving in their rearview mirror, trying to find a gap between the lanes big enough so we may be able to slip through and go on with our lives. But nooooooooo -- these offenders don't feel obligated to go any faster and they refuse to move over to the right because in their sanctimonious minds, they're going fast enough for all of us. That's why they go through great lengths to ignore the high beams glaring in their eyes. And they don't look over at you when you do eventually pass because they can't stop being prickly, not even for the three seconds it takes for us to look at them with our signature, highway glare that says: . I. Won. The thing is there are about 312 million people in the United States and roughly 250 million registered vehicles. There will always be somebody somewhere driving faster ... it's easier for everyone to just let them. Besides, think of all the harm caused by slowpokes? For example, how are cops going to hand out speeding tickets if no one can speed? And what about all the coffee shops that are losing money from the customers who don't have time to pull into the drive-thru before work because they've been trapped behind ""Speedy"" for five miles. Essentially, slow drivers in the left lane are like job killers, and if elected president I would seek a constitutional amendment making lane hoarding illegal. And not just on the highway, but in every facet of life. The folks who like to walk side-by-side chatting on the track at the gym. You know who you are -- move it. The people who stand on an escalator in such a way as to take up the entire step should be assessed a property tax, especially in airports where they know everybody around them is trying to get somewhere else. Really, is it so hard to stand to the right so those people who need to run up the stairs to make their flight, likely because they were trapped behind a slow driver in the left lane on the way to the airport, have a better chance of doing so? If you're visiting a new city, don't stand in the middle of a busy sidewalk to look up or read a map. Step off to the side so those who live there can get to where they are going. This is especially true for the too cute newlyweds who like take up 75% of the sidewalk holding hands and staring into each other's eyes. You don't have to get a room, but you do need to get the hell out of the way. This week we celebrated the 7 billionth person being born, and the first thing I thought about was who is going to teach that person how to drive? How to share the global common space that is slowly becoming more crowded, requiring us to be more aware of the needs of the people all around us? Because at the end of the day, that's what the left lane is really all about. It's not about how fast someone is going. It's about having an agreed upon space where we let each other pass on by. A space we agree upon to let each other be. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: With 7 billion people, the world needs some rules .

"(CNN) -- Now, this just may be the best entertainment news of the summer. It has nothing to do with movie blockbusters. They're coming, as they always do when the weather gets warm: the mass-produced, mind-deadening barrage of predictable sequels, computer-generated explosions and space battles, dreary comedies about groups of wacky buddies, and high-decibel car chase after high-decibel car chase. Which is what makes what happened on a recent Saturday afternoon in Granite Falls, Minnesota, population 2,897, so delightful. A one-day musical theater production was presented that had taken three months to write, rehearse and produce. It took place along an eight-mile stretch of the Minnesota River. More than 200 people attended. And that entire audience was in canoes. For three hours, they paddled from scene to scene. ""The river was the real star of the show,"" said Andrew Gaylord, 33, of St. Paul, Minnesota, who wrote the play and the music for it, and who co-directed it with his producing partner, Ashley Hanson, 29. He said that their intention was to honor and salute the concept of community and place: to provide for their audience an afternoon of entertainment that they couldn't possibly find anywhere else. In dreaming up the idea and getting it done -- putting the audience in those canoes, and having them paddle to each of the six scenes in the play along the eight miles of water -- Gaylord and Hanson may have displayed more sheer ingenuity and grin-inducing creativity than you'll find in any dozen movie-multiplex blockbusters in the months ahead. The play was called ""With the Future on the Line,"" and it told the story of how three Western Minnesota River Valley communities, in the late 1800s, competed to become the county seat. The Minnesota River, though, was without question the leading character, ""with its slow meanders and brutally carved banks, with its fish jumping, turtles sunbathing, eagles soaring, and pelicans taxiing,"" in Gaylord's words. There was a cast of 34, all volunteer amateur actors, and a crew of nearly 100. The scenes took place in six locales along the river ranging from an island to a small bluff overlooking the water; from a campground on the water's edge to a beautiful meadow. The audience would paddle up in their canoes (there were 18 10-person canoes, plus smaller canoes that just sort of tagged along); the audience would sit right there in those canoes and watch the actors play the scene on the shore. Then some of the actors would race ahead in cars to the next location so that they would arrive before the canoes did. ""For me, this was 100% about the celebration of community,"" Ashley Hanson told me. ""We keep being told that, all over the country, the traditional sense of community is being fragmented, is disappearing. That's why it felt so good to put such a tremendous amount of work into something so ephemeral. Something magical that is there for one day only."" She and Gaylord are new at this; they have formed a theater company in St. Paul they call PlaceBase Productions, in the hopes of presenting community-specific shows like this around the nation. They received some financial underwriting for the Granite Falls endeavor from Minnesota organizations devoted to the betterment of life along the river, but on the subject of making enough money doing this to support themselves, ""we're still kind of trying to figure that out,"" Gaylord said with a laugh. Like the rest of us, Gaylord has sat in movie theaters and witnessed that annoying glow as people in row after row check their cellphone screens for messages even while the film is playing. He said one of the nicest parts of the Paddling Theatre (that's what he and Hanson called it) afternoon was that ""I didn't see anyone yakking in their canoes -- I didn't see them on the phone. They seemed like they didn't want to be anywhere else in the world than where they were at that moment."" No professional theater critics attended the production, but outdoors writer Tom Cherveny of the West Central Tribune in nearby Willmar, Minnesota, watched the entire show from a canoe. I asked him what he thought, both of the day and of the performance. ""It was great,"" he said. ""It really did work."" There was something I kept thinking about as I spoke with Gaylord and Hanson, and I hoped they wouldn't be offended if I brought it up, because I meant it as a compliment. One of my favorite movies is ""Waiting for Guffman,"" Christopher Guest's sardonic yet ultimately hopeful 1997 comedy about the fictional small town of Blaine, Missouri, and its against-all-odds attempt to put on a one-day musical for the town's 150th birthday. What happened in Granite Falls felt a little like Guffman-with-paddles, and I wanted to know if that had occurred to Gaylord and Hanson. ""'Guffman' is my battle cry,"" Ashley Hanson said. ""Not the comical elements in it, but the sweetness. ""The importance of making the effort. The sense of sincerity, of caring for a community. ""That's what fuels me. Getting people excited about where they're from. Reminding them of why it matters. Because it does."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: A theater troupe put on a play at various spots along 8 miles of Minnesota River .

"(CNN) -- ""We don't really care what the federal government wants to call us,"" Aran Rush was saying the other afternoon. ""We know that we're a good place."" Rush is the executive director of the convention and visitors bureau in Sioux City, Iowa, and we were discussing what has happened to the little airport with the big problem. The problem was never the airport itself. By all accounts, Sioux Gateway Airport, serving Sioux City and the surrounding area in northwest Iowa, northeast Nebraska, eastern South Dakota and far southern Minnesota, is a fine facility. But the three-letter identifier -- the three capitalized letters that appear on baggage-claim tags, that are used nationwide to refer to the Sioux City airport, that pilots and air-traffic controllers use to designate Sioux City -- has long been a headache for the town. Every city, in this era of marketing and branding, likes to present itself as something special -- a destination that is sparkling and inviting, a wonderful place for families to settle in, or for businesses to set up shop. So, to the dismay of Sioux City, it has not been especially helpful that, for as long as there has been commercial air travel into the town, travelers have glanced at the tags on their checked baggage and have noticed that the official designator for the town is: . SUX . Yep. Generations ago, federal aviation regulators gave Sioux City that identifier. It was a shortened version of ""Sioux."" That was in the years before those three letters took on a somewhat unfortunate tone. Los Angeles International Airport was LAX; O'Hare International Airport in Chicago was ORD; LaGuardia in New York was LGA; Sioux City was SUX. No big deal. Until it was. No city, no airport, wants to be connected to those letters. It's not a great calling card, not an ideal howdy-do to the world beyond the town's borders. Many people find the word (however you spell it) offensive -- and if you, by chance, think the word is not very nice, try to consider how the proud citizens of Sioux City have felt. On two occasions -- in the 1980s, and again at the beginning of this century -- Sioux City earnestly and formally petitioned the Federal Aviation Administration to change the letters. The word just wasn't doing the town any good. On both occasions, nothing happened. I covered Sioux City's second attempt to get rid of SUX; a spokeswoman for the FAA at the time signaled to me that the town's odds of getting three new letters were slim. The Sioux City airport director at the time told me the FAA informed him that the only reason it would change a three-letter identifier was for safety considerations. He conceded that he didn't know how SUX could be construed as a safety issue, ""unless pilots are laughing so hard when they hear it that it distracts them from doing their job."" The reason I got back in touch with Sioux City's leaders last week is that recently the federal government has shown it will speedily get involved in aviation-related issues when it wants to. Congress stepped in to ease air-traffic delays caused by federal spending cuts; the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration, to put travelers' minds at ease, backed off on its plan to allow passengers to bring small knives onto planes. So I wondered if Sioux City was still trying to persuade the government to allow it to get rid of those three dreaded letters . ""We decided to go completely the other way,"" said David Bernstein, president of the airport's board of trustees. ""The FAA wasn't going to change it, so it wasn't going to do us any good to whine about it."" Thus, the town made a bold decision: . It would embrace the SUX designator. It would make it part of Sioux City's charm -- a whimsical part of the civic personality. T-shirts were printed up with those three capital letters on the front; hats and postcards and coffee mugs and balsa-wood airplanes and silver-wing pins were manufactured, all jauntily bearing the letters. On I-29 between Sioux City and Omaha, Nebraska, a big billboard was rented, displaying, in huge type, those letters, as a way to lure passengers to the airport in Iowa instead of the one in Nebraska. ""In warm weather, you can walk around Sioux City and see people wearing the T-shirts all the time,"" Bernstein said. ""At our coffee shop in the airport, between one-third and one-half of net revenues come from the sale of items with those three letters on them."" The city -- in the words of tourism director Rush -- has ""very successfully made lemonade out of some lemons. Our treating the situation with good humor has emblemized the spirit of Sioux City -- one of grit and determination, something no label from the government can change."" The airport commission's Bernstein said that ""it's better to be memorable than to have three initials no one can really recall."" In fact, in the spirit of all this, the town ended up renaming the official website for the airport; it is now www.flysux.com. And who, on a national scale, can argue with that message? These days, with overcrowded planes, long security lines and hefty fees to check baggage, flying often really does ... well, you know. What will Sioux City do about the letters in future years? It could once have sought counsel from two of the most famous people ever born there: twin sisters Ann Landers (Eppie Lederer) and Dear Abby (Pauline Phillips), who left Sioux City to become the two most renowned newspaper advice columnists in history. But both have passed away, and are no longer available for commiseration. So the town is on its own. The mayor, Bob Scott, a lifelong resident, told me that he wants the world to know that Sioux City doesn't do what those three letters on the baggage tags says. It is, he said, a great place to live, ""and we're thankful for that."" He sends emphatic word to potential visitors that they will be warmly welcomed: . ""Absolutely. We'd love to have them.

"(CNN) -- ""The Lone Ranger"" is expected to be one of the biggest movies of the summer; it opens over the long Fourth of July weekend, and the promotional buildup is in high gear. There will be much discussion about how the top-ranking box-office star in the movie, Johnny Depp, portrays not the Lone Ranger, but Tonto. The title role is being played by Armie Hammer, an actor not as familiar to audiences around the world. The most interesting thing about the movie, though -- and potentially the most heartening thing -- will be if it manages to bring back into American life the greatest single aspect of the old ""Lone Ranger"" television show. Not the ""Hi-Yo Silver, away!"" cry of the Lone Ranger, although that was always a thrill to see and hear. Not Silver himself, although the white stallion was a majestic and beautiful horse. Not the ""William Tell Overture,"" although few pieces of music have ever been so inextricably linked to a fictional hero. It will be fine and fitting if the producers and director of the new ""Lone Ranger"" include all of those things in the film. But the real service they will be providing to the country is if they have had the good judgment to emphasize the best lesson the Lone Ranger taught. It came at the end of every half-hour television episode. The Lone Ranger -- played by the incomparable Clayton Moore -- would have finished doing laudable deeds and fighting injustice in whatever Western town to which that week's plot had taken him and Tonto. Goodness had prevailed. One of the local citizens would turn to thank the Lone Ranger for what he had done -- to tell him how grateful the town was. But the Lone Ranger would be gone. He would already have ridden away astride Silver. In the national memory, the townsman or townswoman would always say: . ""Who was that masked man?"" In reality, the exact words would vary from episode to episode. Sometimes the person would say: ""He never even told us his name."" Sometimes it would be: ""But I never got a chance to thank him -- who was that man?"" However the question was phrased, the answer was unfailingly some version of: . ""You don't know who that was? Well, that was ... the Lone Ranger!"" Cue William Tell. And the unspoken lesson -- one very much out of fashion today -- was: . Let your deeds stand for themselves. Don't blow your own horn; don't seek credit or applause. If you do something well, there's no need to tell people about it, or hang around waiting for cheers. Do good, and then get out. Don't trawl for gratitude. Resist curtain calls. Legends grow largest in absentia. Those verities seem to have been steamrollered into oblivion in our culture, in which people appear to believe that each new smidgeon of personal achievement must instantly be shared with the world via every social network or public microphone available. The Lone Ranger had no interest in being present when, belatedly, the people he had helped figured out just what a fine job he had done; it's hard to imagine him riding away from the town, pulling Silver to a halt in some canyon, and sending word to his Facebook friends that he had saved the day once again. But if he were around in the 21st century, where the unofficial theme song is ""There's No Aggrandizement Like Self-Aggrandizement,"" his reticence would make him seem like an outcast, at odds with the tenor of the times. ""The Lone Ranger"" television series ran from 1949 until 1957, and stayed on the air in reruns for decades. If there was anyone bigger and more admired than the Lone Ranger in the years when the TV show originally was seen, it was Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was then serving as president of the United States. Eisenhower was a person who instinctively understood the Lone Ranger ethos -- he knew that if a man has done his work well enough, he doesn't have to proclaim it. While in the White House, he wrote a letter to a friend in which he lamented that ""some people tend to confuse facility of expression with wisdom; a love of the limelight with depth of perception."" There was no such thing as Twitter when Ike was alive, but if there had been, you kind of sense that he never would have tweeted: ""Just led the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe. Boo-ya!"" Clayton Moore died at age 85 in 1999; he had some heartache after the television series went off the air. He enjoyed making public appearances as the Lone Ranger, telling stories to children and their parents. But in 1981, a California movie producer made a new ""Lone Ranger"" film starring someone named Klinton Spilsbury. The producer and his take-no-prisoners lawyers went relentlessly after Clayton Moore, telling him that he could no longer wear the Lone Ranger mask in public, threatening him with harsh and dire legal sanctions. I had gotten to know Moore late in his life; he was quietly crushed by the disdain with which he was being treated. He told me that the entertainment-industry lawyer going after him ""told me again and again that I was too old to be the Lone Ranger. He told me that he was going to get an injunction against me ever appearing as the Lone Ranger again, and he said that I could expect to see a marshal at my door to deliver the injunction. I felt afraid and desperate. ""I can't tell you how hurt I was. I'm a gentleman, though, and I walked out as a gentleman would walk out -- as a gentleman."" You can only hope that once the door closed, the lawyer was chastened enough to sit there at the conference table for a moment and ask himself: . Who was that masked man? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","New movie ""The Lone Ranger"" will come out this summer, styled after the old TV show .

"(CNN) -- The letter in the U.S. mail came as a surprise. Not the return address -- Cathy Sadler had been corresponding with her old fifth-grade teacher for several years, so she recognized the address of the retirement community in Dublin, Ohio. But when Sadler, who lives in North Carolina, opened the envelope, she found something she wasn't expecting. It was a photocopy of an old Mother's Day card. There were many signatures on the card. She found her own name among them. She was Cathy Holt back then, a fifth-grader at Montrose Elementary School in Bexley, Ohio. Miss Twyford had been the teacher. That's how all of her students, all of the 10- and 11-year-olds in that 1958 classroom, referred to her. Geraldine Twyford was her full name. ""She's still Miss Twyford to me,"" Cathy Sadler, now 65, told me the other day. ""She was such a wonderful teacher -- she brought such excitement and enthusiasm to her job. You could tell she wasn't just going through the motions. She loved teaching. My own love of history started in that classroom."" Her admiration for Miss Twyford is what led Sadler to seek her out and start writing to her. At 86, Miss Twyford chooses not to use e-mail -- she writes her letters in elegant longhand. The old card -- the kind you would buy at a drugstore-- featured the embossed message: ""You're such a sweet person, So thoughtful and kind, That days such as this, Always bring you to mind. Happy Mother's Day."" Surrounding those words were all the signatures -- written neatly in fountain pen, in children's script. The names were of the students in Miss Twyford's class: Arloa Shultz, Kent Kellner, Paula Young, Susan Bryant, Joe Sebring, Sherry Lamp, Maury Topolosky, many more. There was the signature of one child -- Alan (Peewee) Meyers, is what he wrote -- a sprightly, friendly boy who, three years later, would lose his life in an automobile accident. Miss Twyford, in 1958, was unmarried and had no children. Yet the boys and girls had decided to present her with the Mother's Day card. And she had saved it for all these years. I called her last week at the retirement community in Ohio. She has been a widow since 2011; at age 39 she married Bob Ferguson, an electrical engineer in the aeronautics field, and they remained wed for 46 years until his death. ""I'm not Mrs. Ferguson to my old students,"" she said. ""I'm always Miss Twyford. Which is fine with me."" I asked her about the card. ""I was surprised, and so touched, that they would give that to me,"" she said. She said that she had kept it in a ""treasure chest"" -- a footlocker where she has preserved all of her most precious memories. ""To me, the card meant that the boys and girls knew how much I cared for them,"" she said. ""As a teacher, you always hope that you mean something to the children, and you hope that they understand how much they matter to you. ""As I look at the card from time to time, I see also that it is a sign that we accomplished one of our goals that year. In the fifth grade, students were expected to learn how to write in cursive, in ink. When you use ink, in a fountain pen, there is no erasing, no way to cover your mistakes. So I think they were showing that to me, too."" She told me that she grew up an only child in Gratiot, Ohio, a town of just 250 people. She said that a career teaching fifth grade -- she spent 30 years doing it -- was a full and satisfying way to spend her life. At Montrose Elementary, where she taught for 16 of those years, she said her classroom was on the top floor, overlooking Main Street. ""It was Route 40,"" she said. ""The old National Road. I would tell the boys and girls to look out the window at the cars on the street, and to try to imagine the covered wagons moving west all those years ago, right there, carrying people who had left everything behind to start a new life."" The main reason she has kept the Mother's Day card, she said, was a simple one: . ""I never had children of my own. ""It is the only Mother's Day card I ever received."" She said that, as a teacher, ""You sometimes look out into your classroom and silently think, 'I wonder what will happen to them when they grow up.' "" Fifty-five years later, it is a Sunday in May again. She is 86, and on her own. In those 30 years of teaching, more than 700 boys and girls moved through her classrooms. I know every person who signed that card; I know those who are living, and I knew those who have passed away. And on this, I think I can safely speak for all of them. The words on the card still hold true: . "". . .So thoughtful and kind, That days such as this, Always bring you to mind."" Happy Mother's Day, Miss Twyford. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Former classmate's fifth-grade teacher sent copy of 1958 Mother's Day card .
Students had given the card to Miss Twyford, beloved teacher who had no children .
Greene: Miss Twyford says she treasures card; only Mother's Day card she's received .
Greene: She's taught 700 kids; all would surely say: Happy Mother's Day, Miss Twyford ."
"(CNN) -- Devoted fans. Faithful listeners. Seldom have those words sounded quite so apt. They describe the people who enjoyed the singing of George Beverly Shea, who died last week at the age of 104. The name may not be instantly recognizable to some Americans, but that was no fault of his. He accomplished something very few vocalists can claim: During his career, he sang in front of an estimated 200 million people in live performance. How could this be? He was the lead vocalist at Billy Graham's crusades and revival meetings for more than 50 years. If you went to see Billy Graham preach, you heard George Beverly Shea sing. And, oh, what a voice he had. It didn't matter what your own religious beliefs were. If you were interested in the craft -- the art -- of vocal performance, and you were in the presence of Bev Shea (that's how he was known to his friends), then you recognized greatness. He was not fancy as he sang, he indulged in no gimmicks, at times he seemed as calm before a microphone as a man waiting patiently for a bus. But that was deceptive. His deep and immaculately modulated baritone, his resolute attention to precise phrasing and pronunciation, his implicit and unmistakable regard for his audience -- this was a professional artist of the highest order. The fact that he sang gospel music might, in theory, have worked against him, might have limited the number of his potential listeners; for many of the years of his career, the nation was obsessed with rock 'n' roll and other forms of popular, here-one-week, gone-the-next records. But he had a certain advantage: . A singer's audience is often influenced by the person who presents him or her. In the Beatles' early days, they had CBS television's Ed Sullivan to do that. It made a big difference. George Beverly Shea, for half a century, had Billy Graham to present him. At all those crusades, in all those stadiums and arenas, they were a matched pair. Graham wouldn't have had it any other way. They perfectly complemented each other's strengths. Graham, at his peak, was utterly electric on a stage -- his presence was crackling and palpable, there was no structure in the world too big for him. In the charisma and magnetism department, he needed no help. But Shea was steady and soothing and reassuring. He was placid waters to Graham's blazing lightning. And for all those years, he was a considerable part of the draw. Hear and see Bev Shea sing at 1961 Billy Graham crusade . In 1971, when I was getting started as a reporter, the Billy Graham Crusade was scheduled to come to Chicago's cavernous McCormick Place for a week-and-a-half of summer services. I asked his advance team if I could spend days and nights with them, observing how they did what they did: how they made the arrangements and logistical decisions to get all those people to pack the huge hall every evening. They were welcoming and open about having me hang around. Those were the years when the most successful and highly publicized musical acts were groups such as Three Dog Night and Creedence Clearwater and Alice Cooper. So I was struck to find how constant, in my conversations with the people who were coming to the crusade meetings, their unprompted references to Shea were. He was a major and incandescent star to them -- they had been listening to him for years, and they couldn't wait to see him perform in person. There was a phrase back then that was used in politics: the Silent Majority. In those times of turmoil and earsplitting acrimony in public life, the term referred to those Americans who didn't raise much commotion, but whose fidelity to tradition was unwavering. I thought then, and I think now, that the concept also applied to the enduring popularity of Shea. He never tried to be stylish or trendy; he didn't shift his approach as the decades went by. He just sang like a dream -- and, with his clear, careful enunciation and his dignified comportment on stage, he showed unwavering respect for the people in the seats. To watch and listen to Shea sing ""How Great Thou Art,"" the gospel number most closely associated with him, was to be in the presence of an absolute master. (And if you've ever heard Elvis Presley's haunting rendition of the same song, then you just know that Elvis had to be a George Beverly Shea fan, too.) He did fine for himself: more than 70 albums, a Grammy Award, a separate Lifetime Achievement Award from the Grammy organization. In the days when what is now called terrestrial radio -- that is, free radio, broadcast by local stations -- ruled, you couldn't help hearing his voice as you twisted the dial through the stations in your town. He was a permanent cast member of Billy Graham's ""Hour of Decision,"" which was syndicated to local stations all over the country, and the power of that voice would stop your hand, at least momentarily, from seeking something farther down the dial. On Sunday his funeral will be held in Montreat, North Carolina, his home for many years; on Monday he will be buried in a private ceremony on the grounds of the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, North Carolina. I remember asking a member of the audience at that long-ago crusade in Chicago what it was that made Shea's music so important to her. ""When he sings,"" she said, ""he just brings me comfort."" Which, in an often frenzied world, is not a bad sum-up of a long, serene and melodic life. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","George Beverly Shea, gospel singer at Billy Graham crusades, died recently at 104 .
Bob Greene: Regardless of their faith, people knew greatness when they heard Shea .
Graham was electric on stage, Greene says. Shea was soothing and comforting .

"(CNN) -- How much do you hate it when some meddling boss is leaning way-too-close over your shoulder, micro-checking and second-guessing every bit of work you do? Well, if you think you hate it now, get ready. Because, as annoying as it can seem today, every indication is that, as far as the stress of bosses hovering over your shoulder goes, these may soon be regarded as the good old days. The first signs of what is coming can be seen at nine U.S. colleges this spring. At those schools, a pilot program designed by CourseSmart, a Silicon Valley company that distributes electronic textbooks, is under way. The shift from print to digital, as we all know, is picking up velocity everywhere, including at colleges and universities. Soon enough, just about all textbooks will be digital. Which is where CourseSmart comes in. Not only does the company provide the electronic books -- it is offering professors and administrators the opportunity to do something previously impossible with books printed on paper. CourseSmart keeps track of, and provides to professors, real-time data about how each student is using his or her digital textbooks, ""including page views, time spent in a textbook, notes taken, highlights made, bookmarks used, and whether or not the student even opened the book,"" according to Alexandra Tilsley of the online publication Inside Higher Ed. CourseSmart says that this is all designed for the ultimate good of the students, because its software allows faculty to ""identify 'at risk' students based on engagement with assigned course materials"" -- meaning: We know if you really studied the book last night. Tracy Hurley, dean of the school of business at Texas A&M University-San Antonio, told reporter David Streitfeld of The New York Times: ""It's Big Brother, sort of, but with a good intent."" Maybe the intent is, indeed, worthy, as far as college classes are concerned. But you just know that, as soon as CourseSmart perfects the software and launches it into widespread use, American business and industry are going to glom onto it and adapt it to the workplace. This is the tool that corporations everywhere have been waiting for: a way to stand over the shoulder of every employee, 24 hours a day, and keep track of exactly how much time he or she is really spending on his or her work. The technology would allow bosses to oh-so-casually tell their subordinates: ""If you're not too busy, why don't you go over this report again tonight?"" And then, the next morning, say: . ""Did you get a chance to work on that report?"" ""Yes, sir, I went over it at home on my iPad, and it looked fine to me."" ""Funny thing, Smithers -- our software indicates that the last time you even looked at the report was two days ago."" Oh, the possibilities are endless. It's Big Brother, all right, corporate edition. Employees will be judged not just by the quality or creativity or ingenuity or precision of their finished work, but will be electronically stared at -- smothered with second-by-second scrutiny -- as they do the work, wherever they are. Already we have willingly given up the distinction between office time and home time; e-mails and cellphones and text messages have erased that line. Employees are always on call. And like it or not, Americans have become accustomed to being constantly observed. Those key cards that corporations issue allow them to find out exactly when their employees were and weren't in the building; the security cameras that dot America's streets and malls and factories have so quickly become ubiquitous that the startling thing is not when something is ""caught on video"" -- but when something somehow isn't. This, though -- the CourseSmart experiment at those nine colleges, and what it could lead to in the business world -- is the beginning of the next phase. ""You all set for the presentation tomorrow, Johnson?"" ""I am -- I've been going over the numbers at home all weekend."" ""Have you, Johnson? Because that's not what our software program shows."" Of course, the employees of the future, the working stiffs, could always object to this -- could demand to be judged on their finished work alone, could insist not to be electronically spied on, could tell their bosses that when they leave the office for the day or for the weekend they're off the clock and off duty, and thus will not be available to be tracked remotely via their tablets and smartphones and laptops. They could take a bold and principled stand and say that. It would make for an amusing anecdote to tell the person in front of them in the unemployment line the next week. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: We all hate a meddling boss closely watching you work over your shoulder .
CourseSmart provides electronic books and monitors students' work for professors .
Before you know it, he says, U.S. businesses will adapt software to the workplace .

"(CNN) -- If you're standing in the rain at the bus stop tomorrow morning, trying to get to work, and if, in the downpour, you should notice that waiting patiently for the bus with you is Bill Gates. . . . Or if you're in a long line at the convenience store, waiting to buy a lottery ticket in the hopes of striking it rich, and you see that the equally hopeful person in front of you in the Powerball line is Mr. Gates. . . . Will you please ask him something? Will you ask him about Winky Dink? We'll get back to Mr. Gates in a moment. He is, as you probably know, one of the world's wealthiest and most influential men. As the co-founder and chairman of Microsoft, he has had vast influence on the way we live -- particularly in the way that screens, and our constant interaction with them, have taken over everything. Which brings us to Winky Dink. A strong case can be made -- and several authors, deep thinkers and historians over the years have made it -- that Winky Dink, more than any other single person (or single cartoon character, in Winky Dink's case), ushered in the era of interactivity. In the early day of television, Americans sat transfixed as the first sets were delivered to homes. The brand-new experience was like having a constantly programmed movie screen in the family living room. The pleasure, the convenience-- all a person had to do was lean back and be entertained. Or so it seemed. But two men -- a pair of fledgling television producers whose names were Harry Prichett and Edwin Wyckoff -- had the foresight to realize that the screen did not necessarily have to be one-way. And that there was money to be made by encouraging people to treat the screen as something with which they could interact. Thus was born ""Winky Dink and You"" -- a primitive and rudimentary first step into what would eventually become the screen-obsessed world in which we live today: millions of people endlessly tapping away, sending and receiving messages, relentlessly responding to what glows in front of their eyes, regarding their screen as almost a person, a friend. ""Winky Dink and You,"" which aired Saturday mornings on CBS beginning in 1953, was hosted by Jack Barry and starred a sprightly, squeaky-voiced cartoon character named. . .well, you know what he was named. Winky Dink's adventures were not all that spectacular -- but it is what he asked the children watching the show to do that heralded a cultural change. Winky Dink said he wanted the children to mail away for a ""Magic Window,"" which was actually a cheaply produced, thin sheet of plastic that adhered to the TV screen by static electricity. ""Send your name and address, along with 50 cents, to Winky Dink, Box 5, New York, 19, New York!"" Those incessantly repeated words became one of the most familiar phrases in the land. Along with the plastic sheet that arrived in the mail were ""magic crayons."" Children were encouraged to place the sheet on their TV screen and watch the show each Saturday, so that Winky Dink could tell them what to do. They might be instructed to draw a ladder on a certain part of the sheet, or a chimney, or a bridge. Then the action on the television screen would combine with what the children had drawn on the plastic sheet to create a narrative-in-motion. It was a sensation, for a while. Children who didn't own the magic sheet or the magic crayons felt left out -- they could watch the show, but they weren't participating in the whole experience. Winky Dink guilted them into sending in the 50 cents so they weren't deprived of what every other kid on the block was doing. The show's downfall derived from two things. According to author Billy Ingram, perhaps the world's leading Winky Dink authority, many children who didn't own the plastic sheets simply took crayons they had around the house and, on Winky Dink's cue, drew directly on the glass screens of their parents' expensive first-generation television sets. And if that didn't make the parents angry enough, there was the concern that the children, by sitting so close to the TV sets as they drew, could be exposing themselves to harmful radiation. The original show went off the air in 1957, and although there were short-lived attempts to revive it, it is now just a distant memory. But Winky Dink's influence lives on in every screen that every person today regards as a two-way window. Which brings us to Bill Gates. There is a line that occasionally pops up in Winky Dink-related literature. The line quotes Gates -- it has him crediting ""Winky Dink and You"" as ""the first interactive TV show."" It certainly would make sense. Gates and his Windows are the logical extension of Winky Dink and his Magic Window. Winky Dink and Gates both saw the true back-and-forth possibilities of those screens. What Gates has accomplished is essentially Winky Dink writ large. Very large. But, try as I might, I was unable to locate a reliable, rock-solid citation for that quote. Was is it real -- had Gates ever actually uttered the words? Or was it merely some tall tale, repeated person-to-person by would-be believers? I contacted the Microsoft corporate offices to ask if they could verify, for the sake of posterity, that Gates had, in fact, once sung the praises of Winky Dink. I had some false starts and hit some dead ends. But then, paydirt. I was able to get in touch with a man by the name of John Pinette, who once worked for Microsoft and who now is a spokesman for Gates himself. Pinette said he had a distinct recollection of having been present at the key moment: . ""I remember the Winky Dink speech -- but don't remember when Bill gave it (or where -- or to whom). It was a brief example of 'here's an early example of interactive TV' before he went on to a bigger presentation of Microsoft's TV efforts. ""He had one of the plastic film sheets -- and the Winky Dink box, if I remember correctly."" So there it is. Gates was born in 1955, so it is unlikely that he remembers watching in first-run the original version of ""Winky Dink and You."" Perhaps he saw the subsequent attempts to bring the show back; perhaps, like so many young Americans of the time, he simply found himself awash in the echoes of Winky's legend. Every creative genius is influenced by someone. Plato was influenced by Socrates. Beethoven was influenced by Mozart. William Faulkner was influenced by Mark Twain. In some future century, a new Mount Rushmore may be carved, to celebrate the figures of our own era who changed the course of the world as dramatically as any presidents or statesmen. It will be only fitting and right if the three faces on the side of the mountain are those of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Winky Dink. Not necessarily in that order. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: A popular 1950s TV show featured interactivity with a screen .

"(CNN) -- We were in touch two weeks ago; Roger Ebert was my friend for more than 40 years, and toward the end of March he took it upon himself to send out one of my CNN columns to his more than 800,000 Twitter followers, and I thanked him for his graciousness and generosity, which were constant. And then, Wednesday, after he had publicly announced that he would be cutting back on his movie reviews as he battled the cancer that would not let up, I wrote him again to say some personal things. We could no longer have regular conversations, of course, because the cancer surgeries had cost him his speaking voice, but the e-mails oddly became more intimate than all the words we said out loud over all the decades. He didn't answer Wednesday's note, which was highly unusual. He died Thursday. I wish you could have known him as a young man -- his laughter, his stories, his sheer joy of being out around other newspaper people. You know how well he wrote -- I wish you could have seen how fast he wrote. It was the sound of a machine gun, on those old manual typewriters. No one writes that fast -- and then, to have the result be so beautiful? Roger was still drinking in those days, and there would be nights on North Avenue in Chicago when the bars would close at 4 a.m., and a group of us would come walking out, and rumbling down the street would be a Chicago Sun-Times delivery truck. We all knew the drivers by name, and they knew us, and they'd stop and invite us to hop in-- they'd give us a ride home while dropping bundles of papers off before dawn. So there we'd be, in those boxy red delivery trucks, and in the back would be the new editions, right off the press, sometimes still warm and damp. There were nights when Roger would pull the top copy off a bundle, and, right there in the truck, he would read the words of the review he had finished writing just hours before ... oh, he seemed so happy on those nights. Opinion: What the Internet owes Roger Ebert . For several Christmases, we've had a tradition. A couple of Decembers ago, on Christmas Day, I took a walk around the downtown area of Chicago, the streets and sidewalks slick with ice and snow. There is a statue, near the Chicago River, of Irv Kupcinet, the late longtime columnist for the Sun-Times. The statue was coated with snow. I snapped a photo of it and sent it to Roger. I told him I was sending it in remembrance of all the Christmas Days when we would be working in the fourth floor newsroom of the old Sun-Times building at 401 N. Wabash Avenue, and Kup would come walking in, snow on his overcoat, on the beat as always, holiday or no. Roger wrote back with three words: . ""Dat's right, Jack!"" I laughed out loud, and I knew that Roger, if he could, would be laughing, too. Kup used to do the WGN Radio broadcasts of Chicago Bears games with play-by-play man Jack Brickhouse. Whatever Brickhouse might say about a play -- a touchdown, a great tackle, an interception -- Kup could be counted on to reply with: . ""Dat's right, Jack!"" And so it was on Christmas Days, right up to and including the last one. I'd once again send that picture of the Kup statue to Roger, and his ""Dat's right, Jack!"" would come back like clockwork. It was Roger who called me one day in 1999, his voice shaking and mournful, to tell me the news that our mutual friend and Ebert's television partner, critic Gene Siskel, had just died. The courage Roger has shown these last years as he has fought his own illnesses -- you can read the details of what he went through in the formal obituaries. A man whose voice was so famous, who loved so much to tell stories: to have that stolen from him -- yet to persevere with such humor and intelligence and basic good-guyness... Ebert kept us entertained at the movies . I was in Chicago for a few days last week. I knew that these recent months had been very difficult for him. On Oak Street, I saw the big, bright vertical sign for the old Esquire Theater. The theater is gone and there's a new and glitzy steakhouse in the building. In 1971, in that newsroom at 401 N. Wabash, Roger walked over and handed me the dupes -- the carbons -- of a review he had just written. It was for a film that was opening that week: ""The Last Picture Show."" The dupes were light green and flimsy, the letters from that Gatling-gun typewriter of his black and distinct. He told me he thought I'd love the movie. So, on that day more than 40 years ago, I went to the Esquire and saw it. He was right. It was wonderful. Last week, seeing the Esquire sign, I walked into the new steakhouse. I wanted to offer Roger a silent toast. I rode an escalator upstairs. Right around where I think the projection booth must have been, there was a bar. I took a seat and ordered something. There is some dialogue in ""The Last Picture Show,"" very near the end. Sam the Lion, the rough-hewn soul of the town, has died, and the woman to whom he turned over the movie theater he owned is lamenting the fact that she is going to have to close it down. Ebert in his own words . She says to the two boys who have shown up on that final night: . ""Nobody wants to come to shows no more. Kid baseball in the summer, television all the time. Sam had lived, I believe we could've kept it going. But I just didn't have the know-how."" And then had come the words: . ""Won't be much to do in town, with the picture show closed."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene, friend of Roger Ebert's for more than 40 years, laments his passing .

"(CNN) -- In American professional sports, you can name a team almost anything. You can give the team a ferocious name (Tigers, Lions, Bears, Grizzlies, Bengals). You can go for a swashbuckling image (Pirates, Buccaneers, Trail Blazers). Colors are all right for a team name (Reds, Browns, Blues). Birds (Orioles, Falcons, Eagles). You can sound regal (Royals, Titans, Kings). Aeronautic themes work (Jets, Flyers, Rockets). Fish (Marlins). Religious imagery (Saints, Padres). Even insects (Hornets). There are some names -- and mascots and logos associated with them -- that have become controversial, but that are still used: Redskins, Indians, Braves. But I have been talking with sports experts and sports-marketing specialists, and they are in agreement that there is one name -- a name that used to belong to a famed big-league baseball team -- that would be met with such antipathy by America's fans that no team today would even think of using it. I refer, of course, to the Senators. ""Not a chance,"" said Rob Fleder, former executive editor of Sports Illustrated and editor of sports books including ""Sports Illustrated's The Baseball Book"" and the baseball anthology ""Damn Yankees."" The Washington Senators were a charter member of the American League, and were around, in one form or another, from 1901 until 1972. For a lot of that time they were a terrible baseball team -- they were derided with a popular saying: ""First in war, first in peace, last in the American League."" But although the team was lousy, no one minded the name. ""People associated 'Senators' with something revered, something held in high regard,"" Fleder said. ""The team wasn't distinguished, but the name was."" Now? With polls showing that the approval rating for Congress is minuscule (around 15% in many polls, 12% in a recent New York Time/CBS News poll), ""no marketing person in his right mind would name a team the Senators,"" Fleder said. Indeed, when, after 33 years without a big-league baseball team, Washington was awarded one for the 2005 season, the owners, probably wisely, went with Nationals, not Senators, for a name. ""You need a name that has a chance to be loveable,"" Fleder said. ""That leaves 'Senators' out."" That's an awfully melancholy commentary on the current state of our public attitudes. Yet purely as a business decision, calling any new big-league sports team the Senators would be seen as ill-advised. Ferguson Jenkins, the Hall of Fame pitcher who broke into the major leagues in 1965, when baseball's Senators were still playing in Washington, said last week: . ""I don't think that any team today would choose to call itself the Senators because of all of the controversy in Washington. I believe that people would think that the name was too political."" Indeed, today's poisonous political environment is the main reason that what was once a perfectly good sports-team name would be a nonstarter now. Sports historian David Krell, author of the forthcoming ""Blue Magic: The Brooklyn Dodgers, Ebbets Field, and the Battle for Baseball's Soul,"" said: . ""The term 'Senator' once sounded much more austere. The country felt differently about Washington. My father said that when men and women would go to the movies, and the newsreel came on and Franklin Roosevelt would appear, the people in the theater would cheer."" Krell recalls hearing an older American proudly ""tell a story about how, as a boy, he memorized the names of all the senators. They were giants. ""But I just don't think you could use that name for a team now. It would be a punch line. Something that Jay Leno would make jokes about every night."" In Canada, a country that may have a more tolerant attitude toward the machinations of government, the professional hockey team in Ottawa was named the Senators early in the 20th century, and, as a member of the National Hockey League, still is. And in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the minor-league baseball team was christened the Senators in 1894, and continues with the tradition of the name. But in the multi-billion-dollar, high-stakes world of U.S. major-league sports -- and even at major U.S. colleges -- it would doubtless be seen as foolhardy to take a chance on using that name. ""Now that the approval ratings for Congress are within the margin of error for ax murderers, it is inconceivable,"" said Ron Rapoport, who traveled the country for decades covering all the major sports for newspapers in Los Angeles and Chicago, and who is the editor of a forthcoming anthology of the greatest sports columns in the history of Chicago newspapers. ""Some of us remember the Washington Senators,"" he said, ""but if someone proposed calling a team the Senators today, young people would scratch their heads and think: 'What a strange choice.'"" The current turmoil in Washington likely hasn't helped matters. Michael Talis, president of Talis Sports Marketing, a company that arranges baseball fantasy camps featuring former big-leaguers and organizes appearances by retired players, said he would worry about the emotional well-being of athletes compelled to wear the uniforms of such a team. ""Players having to take the field with the word 'Senators' stitched in big letters across the front?"" he said. ""Can you imagine the kinds of things the fans would be yelling at them?"" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","In the U.S., you can name a team almost anything, says Bob Greene .
The one certainty is that no one will call a major league team ""the Senators,"" he says .

"(CNN) -- While the rest of the world last week was fixating on the chimney atop the Sistine Chapel, waiting to see whether the smoke would be black or white, it wasn't the smoke that intrigued me. It was the stuff that was making the smoke. The cardinals, after casting their ballots in each round of voting for the new pope, burned those ballots, as is tradition. The burning ballots created the smoke the world witnessed billowing from the chimney. The ballots, of course, were made of paper. Which sometimes seems like an endangered species. Had the cardinals voted on iPads, they couldn't very well have tossed the sleek tablets into the chapel's cast-iron stove. Yet an all-but-paperless society is where some experts argue we are headed. The digital upheaval has gathered such force that every business that once depended on paper has felt the earth shift. Newspapers, magazine publishers, book companies, bookstores, offices of every kind ... the transition to digital is beginning to feel as profound as the revolution once ushered in by the invention of moveable type. The Minneapolis Star Tribune recently noted the precipitous decline of the North American paper industry: ""River towns in the forest from eastern Washington to the coast of Maine have lost more than 100 paper mills in a wave of consolidation in little more than a decade ... North American demand for three types of [coated] paper [has] fallen 21 percent."" The Boston Business Journal last year quoted equity analyst Matt Arnold: ""There's a secular shift to paperless. It's an overarching mind-set."" All of this echoes a 2011 projection by the research firm RISI, which advises the global forest products industry: ""By 2015, most publishing paper end uses in North America, such as magazine, newspaper and book publishing, will fall 12-21 percent, compared to their 2010 levels."" The firm went on to project ""another 40-50 percent fall over the next 15 years."" Thus, there is a special fascination to a promotional campaign developed in recent years by Domtar, one of the world's largest manufacturers of paper. The campaign is not just for Domtar products -- it is for paper itself, no matter where it comes from or who sells it. The theme is: ""Paper Because."" The campaign, hoping to persuade people, proclaims: . ""Paper is good. Pass it on."" It offers heartfelt reasons: . ""Paper means that you mean business."" ""Paper is personal."" ""Sometimes understanding the big picture means spreading it all out on the floor."" ""Opening a nice envelope is surprisingly exciting."" I hasten to say that I'm not knocking those messages -- I agree with every word of them. I just find it illuminating, and more than a little melancholy, that we have reached the point at which those messages are deemed necessary -- the point at which the paper industry feels a need to convince people that paper is important. Before the digital age, the presence of such a campaign would have been puzzling. Tell people that paper is essential to their lives? What else were they supposed to write on -- rocks, using carving tools? It would have been like running promotional campaigns for air, or for water. Such things did not need promotion -- they were indispensable. (And, of course, there is the fact that, as clever and well executed as the ""Paper Because"" campaign is, I found it and browsed through it completely online, on a screen.) A screen is where you are almost undoubtedly reading these words, too. But before I hit the button to send my editors every column, I print out a copy and do the editing and proofreading by hand, on sheets of paper, with a pen. I love the breadth and scope of CNN's digital reach -- the speed and efficiency with which the stories on this site are delivered around the globe makes me think of it as a planetary paperboy with the strongest arm in the world. But there's something about paper. I'm currently about halfway through a copy of Time magazine, cover date September 25, 1950 (yes, I'm a little behind on my reading, but I'm slowly catching up). I'll often buy old magazines not just because I find them to be a wonderful way to delve randomly into America's history at precise moments in time, but also because, at the end of a day spent staring at shifting, constantly updating images on multiple screens, there is something calming about holding carefully laid out and edited sheets of paper, and luxuriating in the steadiness of it all. Maybe you're the same way. Maybe not. Perhaps the magic of paper, and all it has always represented, is something you could just as well do without -- a source of clutter and mustiness. But as magazines and newspapers and books and business offices and schools make their inexorable leap into the digital future, there's nothing wrong with acknowledging just how nice the tactile, comforting, here-when-you-want-me world of words and pictures on paper has been, even while recognizing and appreciating the marvels of the new way. I'm very glad that you've found your way to these words on whatever screen you may be reading them, and I don't think any of us are fooling ourselves into thinking the paper-to-digital course will suddenly be reversed. To use a phrase connected to another once-ubiquitous part of our daily lives: That train has left the station. But you have to hope that the departure has not been total, or at least that it won't become total for a good, long time. In that promotional campaign, there is one line that is meant to be perky and cheerful -- a line that somehow also sounds kind of bittersweet: . ""Hi. I'm paper. Remember me?"" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: With advent of digital age, paper use and demand has dropped like rock .
In fact, by 2015 paper use could fall 21% -- and then over 40% more in the 15 years after .

"(CNN) -- You could see it in his eyes. Even before Pope Francis spoke his first words to the throngs in St. Peter's Square, you could look into his eyes and sense the wonder. The world was looking at him. But he was looking at something, too: at all those upturned faces. At all the eyes staring back at him. Nothing can possibly prepare a person for such a sight. In this life, there are moments, and then there are Moments. The first appearance of a new pope on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica has always been a Moment like no other. Before there was telegraphy, before there was radio, before there was television, before there was the Internet, before there was Twitter, the vision -- the solemn orchestration -- of a newly elected pope stepping onto the balcony was the most dramatic possible way of bringing huge news to the world. It somehow still is. Opinion: Francis, open up the church . ""I would like to thank you for your embrace,"" the new pope said, gazing out at all those eyes. When authors and orators have searched for ways to express the ultimate example of reverential exaltation, the periodically repeated scene in St. Peter's Square, down through the centuries, has often been the one they have turned to. Tom Wolfe, in his book ""The Right Stuff,"" about the original Mercury astronauts, wanted to describe for readers just what level of devotion the newly named astronauts had received from the American people. The seven pilots had been just that -- fighter pilots, test pilots -- before being selected for the space program. Suddenly, they were something else. People would see them and begin crying. Wolfe came up with the one ideal analogy to portray the phenomenon: . ""The boys wouldn't have minded the following. They wouldn't have minded appearing once a year on a balcony over a huge square in which half the world is assembled. They wave. The world roars its approval, its applause, and breaks into a thirty-minute storm of cheers and tears. ... A little adulation on the order of the Pope's; that's all the True Brothers at the top of the pyramid really wanted."" Opinion: Pope Francis, humble, authentic and credible . But humility is not required of fighter pilots and astronauts. Nor is it required of rock stars or professional athletes or any of the many other public performers, in disparate venues, who are regularly introduced with carefully planned and marketed majesty designed to elevate them in the eyes of their audiences. A pope is different, and his introduction to the world is like no other. When Wednesday morning dawned in Rome, a man named Jorge Mario Bergoglio was one of millions of people preparing to commence the new day. By the time the day was over, he was no longer Jorge Mario Bergoglio, and he was no longer one of millions. As Pope Francis, he stepped onto that balcony and was greeted by that sight. From behind his eyeglasses, he took it all in. The eyes of the world met his. He asked for prayers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Before radio, TV, pope's appearance was most dramatic way to announce news .
New pope's appearance on the balcony of St. Peter's is a moment like no other, he says .

"(CNN) -- It goes on every day, in every county in the United States. It's absolutely free. Usually there's no wait to get in. And it can be as compelling as anything on television. The Florida trial in which George Zimmerman stands accused of murdering Trayvon Martin is attracting large TV audiences. The O.J. Simpson trial got the country accustomed to watching high-profile court proceedings gavel-to-gavel; the trial of Jodi Arias drew big ratings before the Zimmerman trial. Viewers return because they find the events almost hypnotic: something that thoroughly captures their attention. But one of the so-omnipresent-that-we-seldom-think-about-it facts of American life is just how much human intrigue, how much tension, how much weakness and heroism and sadness and triumph are on continuous and ever-changing display in multiple and seemingly mundane settings all over the country, each day of the workweek. And how relatively few people choose to sit in the first-come, first-served seats and take it all in. The courtrooms of this nation, both criminal and civil, are bright stages upon which the theater of murder, deceit, heartbreak and duplicity are played out in excruciating and breathtaking detail. In Zimmerman's trial, it's a jury of millions . If you're of a mind to, you can find on those stages narratives as spellbinding as any murder mystery in a bookstore or any crime drama in a movie theater. As a citizen, you can immerse yourself in the tale, day after day. You have to have a little spare time on your hands -- maybe a few days away from work -- and you have to choose a case that most interests you from among the many that are going on at the same moment in the courthouse in your community. The clerk's office will have a calendar of the day's trials, and court employees can be helpful in explaining to you what is transpiring in the various rooms. Trials tend to have ebbs and flows, and there will be times when you have to be willing to sit through lulls. But you will view and hear things more enthralling, more disturbing, more enlightening and more repellent than you might ever have imagined. As a citizen in the seats, you will almost inevitably find yourself becoming a part of the cast of characters of the courtroom. A tangential part, to be sure. But after a few days the attorneys will begin to recognize you, as will the defendants, and the judge, and the bailiffs. You may begin to feel something close to a responsibility to show up -- a responsibility to yourself, not to miss a minute of the story you have started to follow. Why don't more people, especially those who have the time, avail themselves of this opportunity? Perhaps because they seldom stop to think it's there. When a big trial makes it to TV, the assumption is that it has some special quality to attract that spotlight. That may be partially true. But although the sensational trials draw audiences because they're on television, there is so much to see and feel in the courtrooms of even the smallest cities and towns. The matters that bring people to trial -- whether acts of shattering violence, double-dealing in business transactions, any of the hundreds of variations of robbery and theft -- find their way to virtually every crossroads, and thus eventually into virtually every courthouse. Mom vs. mom in the Zimmerman trial . You can be captivated by just how skilled some attorneys are -- and surprised by just how ill-prepared some others are. You'll study the judge -- his or her shifting moods -- as if he or she is the protagonist in a paperback potboiler. You'll make eye contact with the defendants and the jury members. And there is nothing quite like the moment when that jury returns with its verdict. This is a country that somehow becomes giddy when two singers face off in a televised talent contest, and one goes on to the next round while the other goes home. That feeling pales compared to the sensation of sitting in a courtroom, your vital signs kicking into a higher gear as the judge asks the foreman if there is a decision, and the seconds drag on before the words are read aloud. The best part of the experience is that it's not taking place on a cold screen in front of millions of distant, unseen viewers -- it is unfolding a few feet from your eyes. Most cases, even in medium-sized towns, aren't covered by the local newspapers; there are just too many courtrooms for that. But the curtain rises every morning, in public buildings everywhere in the U.S. And, beyond the raw fascination of what goes on, there is another, much more vital, reason to attend: . Because someone should bear witness. Because this is American justice, carried out in all of our names. And anyone who cares to be there is always cordially invited. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Zimmerman trial riveting, but why limit yourself to TV trials?
He says in county and local courtrooms across U.S., trials constantly on display. Go watch!
He says subjects are murder, robbery, financial shenanigans; it's free, tense, fascinating .
Greene: Beyond that, it's American justice carried out for us all; important to bear witness ."
"(CNN) -- Memo to Carly Rae Jepsen, Frank Ocean, Hunter Hayes, Mumford & Sons, Miguel, the Alabama Shakes and all the other young singers and bands who are nominated for Sunday night's Grammy Awards: . Your real prize -- the most valuable and sustaining award of all -- may not become evident to you until 30 or so years have passed. You will be much older. But -- if you are lucky -- you will still get to be out on the road making music. Many of Sunday's Grammy nominees are enjoying the first wave of big success. It is understandable if they take for granted the packed concert venues and eye-popping paychecks. Those may go away -- the newness of fame, the sold-out houses, the big money. But the joy of being allowed to do what they do will go on. I've been doing some work while staying at a small hotel off a highway in southwestern Florida. One winter day I was reading out on the pool deck, and there were some other people sitting around talking. They weren't young, by anyone's definition. They did not seem like conventional businessmen or businesswomen on the road, or like retirees. There was a sense of nascent energy and contented anticipation in their bearing, of something good waiting for them straight ahead. A look completely devoid of grimness or fretfulness, an afternoon look that said the best part of the day was still to come. I would almost have bet what line of work they were in. I'd seen that look before, many times. I could hear them talking. Yep. The Tokens (""The Lion Sleeps Tonight,"" a No. 1 hit in 1961). Little Peggy March (""I Will Follow Him,"" a No. 1 hit in 1963). Little Anthony and the Imperials (""Tears on My Pillow,"" a top 10 hit in 1958). Major singing stars from an earlier era of popular music, in town for a multi-act show that evening. It is the one sales job worth yearning for -- carrying that battered sample case of memorable music around the country, to unpack in front of a different appreciative audience every night. It's quite a world. I was fortunate enough to learn its ins and outs during the 15 deliriously unlikely years I spent touring the United States singing backup with Jan and Dean (""Surf City,"" a No. 1 hit in 1963) and all the other great performers with whom we shared stages and dressing rooms and backstage buffets: . Chuck Berry, Martha and the Vandellas, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, the Everly Brothers, James Brown, Lesley Gore, Freddy ""Boom Boom"" Cannon, the Kingsmen, the Drifters, Fabian, the Coasters, Little Eva, the Ventures, Sam the Sham. ... Jukebox names whose fame was once as fresh and electric as that now being savored by Sunday's young Grammy nominees. Decades after that fame is new, the road may not be quite as glamorous, the crowds may not be quite as large. The hours of killing time before riding over to the hall, the putrid vending-machine meals on the run, the way-too-early-in-the-morning vans to the airport -- the dreary parts all become more than worth it when, for an hour or so, the singers can once again personally deliver a bit of happiness to the audiences who still adore their music. Greene: Super Bowl ad revives iconic voice . As the years go by, the whole thing may grow complicated -- band members come and go, they fight and feud, some quit, some die. There are times when it seems you can't tell the players without a scorecard -- the Tokens at the highway hotel were, technically and contractually, Jay Siegel's Tokens (you don't want to know the details). One of their singers (not Jay Siegel -- Jay Traynor) was once Jay of Jay and the Americans, a group that itself is still out on the road in a different configuration with a different Jay (you don't want to know). But overriding all of this is a splendid truism: . Sometimes, if you have one big hit, it can take care of you for the rest of your life. It can be your life. Sunday's young Grammy nominees may not imagine, 30 years down the line, still being on tour. But they -- the fortunate ones -- will come to learn something: . They will grow old, but their hits never will -- once people first fall in love with those songs, the songs will mean something powerful and evocative to them for the rest of their lives. And as long as there are fairground grandstands on summer nights, as long as there are small-town ballparks with stages where the pitcher's mound should be, the singers will get to keep delivering the goods. That is the hopeful news waiting, off in the distance, for those who will win Grammys Sunday, and for those who won't be chosen. On the morning after that pool-deck encounter in Florida I headed out for a walk, and in the parking lot of the hotel I saw one of the Tokens loading his stage clothes into his car. His license plate read: . SHE CRYD . I said to him: . ""You sing lead on 'She Cried,' right?"" ""Every night,"" he said, and drove off toward the next show. The next show. That's the prize. That's the trophy, right there. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Grammy nominated acts should remember the real prize comes later in life .

"(CNN) -- This is the week, every year, when you come across special displays in bookstores. (Finding bookstores these days is a challenge of its own, but that's a subject for another time). During the week after Christmas and before January 1, many bookstores set up tables near the front door featuring calendars and blank journals. If the calendars aren't sold by the first day of the new year, they're probably not going to be sold at all. And, next to the calendars on the table, those blank journals, wordless for now. Waiting for the soundless starter's whistle of New Year's Day -- waiting for someone to fill them in. What they represent is one of mankind's oldest and fiercest desires: . The opportunity to start afresh. To turn over a new leaf. ""New leaf"" refers not to the world of plants, but to the formal, even archaic, term for a two-sided piece of paper. To turn over a new leaf means to flip to a new page. To try to do better -- to close the cover on the scratch-outs and unsatisfactory scrawls of the previous part of one's life and, having learned from what went before, to start over on a clean set of pages. ""Tabula rasa,"" in the Latin expression: blank slate. And what to do with that blank slate? Each December, each person makes his or her own pledges. This December there has been a phrase that has been much in the news: First responders. It is a relatively new description. In earlier generations, the people to whom it applied were referred to simply as police officers or firefighters or emergency squads. The people who, in times of great trouble, run toward the peril and not away from it. Every day, in every part of the country, they humble us with their courage and commitment. The first responders we have been reporting on and reading about as the old year nears its end have given new meaning to ""above and beyond the call of duty"": . The officers who sped to Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and encountered what no person should ever have to see. The volunteer firefighters in Webster, New York, who were unconscionably cut down in a murderous ambush as they selflessly reported to a predawn blaze. The men and women who without hesitation risked their lives trying to rescue the victims of Superstorm Sandy. Very few of us will ever have the courage or the training or the physical strength of the first responders who have been in the news this year. But, by following the spirit of their example, we can set a goal for the new year that is about to begin -- for those blank pages of life that await. Unlike those who wear uniforms, the rest of us are not expected to hurry to crime scenes or fires or places of mass injury. But, far away from the wail of sirens, there is so much hurting and loneliness that surrounds us in this world, so much need and hunger and solitary despair. You don't have to wear a badge to be a first responder; you just have to keep your eyes open and be willing to help. To be the one who, without being asked, responds and offers assistance when no one else seems to be noticing. A kind word; an inquiry about if there's anything you can do; a few moments of giving quiet encouragement. It is such an elementary, yet profound, decision to make as a new year begins: to choose to be a first responder in the broadest sense of that phrase. To be the person ever attuned to the sight and sound of need. To move toward that need without being summoned. To be the one who can be counted on. We have all been inspired and stirred this year by the valor of the real first responders. We prepare to enter a new year with all of the pages still blank, in readiness. How we fill them in is our choice. It awaits us, just around the bend. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: With every new year, there's an opportunity to start afresh .

"(CNN) -- In a country as splintered as the United States has become, can there be any such thing as a national pastime? The phrase has been associated with the game of baseball since late in the 19th century, when sportswriters began dropping it into their stories. It was a great promotional slogan for the sport; whether it ever was literally true is open to question. But it would be just about impossible to make the case that baseball is the national pastime today; in a country of 314 million people, this year's World Series drew, on average, a television audience of only 12.7 million viewers per game (football's Super Bowl this year attracted an audience of more than 111 million). Yet the question is not which sport has become the national pastime, but whether any single activity of any kind qualifies for that title. Cohesion is not exactly the dominating quality of 21st-century life; we are endlessly being reminded of all the choices we have about how to spend our time, and the concept of the entire country gravitating toward one leisure-time activity sounds beyond archaic. If baseball ever was, at least symbolically, the national pastime, it was supplanted in the early 1950s by the rapid growth in the number of television sets in American homes. Suddenly something was happening that had never before occurred: People all over the country were looking at the same thing at the same time. Most mornings, the main topic of conversation in offices, factories and schools across the continent was something that had been on all those television screens the night before. There were only three channels to watch in most cities, and perhaps an additional ""educational"" channel, the forerunner to PBS. The nation had a new pastime, and it took place indoors. The great majority of Americans who are alive today have no memory at all of a world before television. The median age in the United States hovers right around 37 years old; this means that half of all Americans were born in 1975 or later. The presence of television, to them, is as unremarkable as the sight of the sun in the summer sky. And a newer pastime, as we all know, has emerged, on screens of a different sort. To take note of how free time (whatever that has come to mean) is now being spent, all you have to do is walk down any street in any city or small town, and observe your fellow pedestrians checking the screens they grasp in their palms. But the hegemony of early television, with those three channels, is a distant memory. No one can take the public's attention for granted today; first the advent of cable television fragmented viewing patterns, and then came the boundless Internet, followed by the creative forces that provide the content for all those little personal screens. Apple offers around 700,000 separate applications, as does Google. A lot of ways to pass the time, in a nation with a twitching concentration span. And there is always something around the next corner. The same way there are fewer and fewer Americans who can describe to you what the country was like before television, soon enough there will be few Americans who will be able to recall a world before the Internet. It is hard to conceive, but social history tells us that the seemingly limitless array of ways to spend time today will before long seem constricted and small. There is a famous and provocative phrase, translated from the writings of Karl Marx, that has been used in various contexts over the years: ""the opiate of the masses."" The concept of people being susceptible to a symbolic opiate of any kind remains controversial and current. Do today's Americans simply enjoy the screens they carry with them, or are they psychologically addicted to them -- is it a pleasurable pastime, or are they hooked? It's not an unfair question. (And as far as opiates go -- pharmacological and figurative -- the Wall Street Journal recently reported on an intriguing development at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, as explained by Rhonda Scott, Grady's chief nursing officer: ""Grady agreed to double the number of TV channels in rooms and add ESPN because 'the requests for pain medication go down during the afternoon football games,' Dr. Scott said."") Our pastimes are many, and the very idea of a national pastime goes against the contemporary aversion to doing only one thing at a time. Although the very real possibility exists that, seemingly contradictorily, we have indeed settled on a new kind of national pastime: . Multitasking. Baseball's starting to sound better and better. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene says it's been awhile since baseball has been the U.S. national pastime .
He says life fragmented today; few things unify Americans as a shared pastime. TV once did .

"(CNN) -- ""Hey, Joe!"" There was a time in American life that if you shouted those words on a busy street, or on a factory floor, you might see dozens of people turning expectantly toward you. Joes were everywhere. For much of U.S. history, Joseph was one of the top 10 names that families gave to their newborn sons. Today, Joe no longer even makes the top 20. America is ever-changing, in any number of ways, and one of the most fascinating of them can be found in the names mothers and fathers give to their sons and daughters. The Social Security Administration, in addition to sending checks to older Americans, keeps track of the names of the youngest Americans: newborns. The agency does this for bookkeeping purposes: the babies will someday, during their working lives, be a source of revenue for the SSA, and later (assuming Social Security survives) will be recipients of retirement income. In the meantime, by compiling the names and their ranking in popularity (the list goes back to the birth year 1880), the agency paints a perpetually in motion portrait of what we are called. Read more: Mohammed retakes top spot in English baby names . And what we are called is no longer, in the main, what we were once called. This is probably a good thing -- it is an affirmation of the vitality of a nation moving always into the future. Yet some of the particulars would undoubtedly startle just about every Tom, Dick and Harry. Whose three names, as emblemized by that time-honored phrase, were, for much of the 20th century, on the tip of America's tongue. But, according to the SSA's most recent compilations, Thomas no longer makes the top 50 names for newborns. Dick (formally, Richard) has dropped out of the Hot 100. Harry comes in all the way down at No. 709. The evolution in names has been building in strength for quite a while; it kicked into high gear in the 1970s, '80s and '90s when, according to SSA records, Tylers and Brandons, Brittanys and Kaylas, Ryans and Megans and Heathers and Jasons began to join and supplant the names that had for generations dominated the all-but-static lists. And by now the iconic names of the seemingly not-so-distant past appear destined to be iconic no more. John? John of Johnny Carson, John of John Wayne, John of Johnny Unitas? John of Johnny Depp (who was born in 1963, when John was the No. 2-most popular name)? John has fallen out of the top 25. Maybe Johnny Football will help him come back. Goodnight, David, goodnight, Chet? David, once a No. 1 champion, misses the top 15; Chester is not listed in the top 1,000. Bob (formally, Robert) was a longtime (1924 to 1939) No. 1, but today he fails to crack the top 50. In the words of a great mid-'60s song by the Everly Brothers, he's ""Gone, Gone, Gone."" Read more: Does your name shape your destiny? (As are the first names of Don and Phil Everly themselves, as far as current popularity goes. Donald comes in at No. 376; Philip -- or Phillip, with the extra ""l"" -- is at No. 406 and/or 378.) So if those once-standard names have vanished from the top 10, who, according to the SSA, are some of the guys who have replaced them in today's top 10? Say hello to Mason. Meet Ethan. Hi there, Jayden. Nice to make your acquaintance, Aiden. And the change is even more dramatic for girls. Mary, the most popular female name ever, including an uninterrupted 66-year streak at No. 1, from 1880 through 1946? Mary has dropped down to No. 112. The pattern holds for many of the other female names that were, in the middle of the 20th century, utterly commonplace. Nancy is at No. 541 today. Deborah is at No. 808. Patricia is at No. 667. Barbara is at No. 764. Sandy (as in Sandra) is at No. 614. Carol? No. 972. And then there's Donna. In the late 1950s she was No. 5, as America danced to ""I had a girl, Donna was her name"" and watched ""The Donna Reed Show"" on television. Today Donna has fallen all the way out of the top 1,000. To be replaced in the current top 10 by, among others, Olivia, Ava, Abigail, Madison, Mia and Chloe. Read more: Parents name child after Facebook 'Like' button . What accounts for the changes in names and tastes? There are probably as many individual reasons as there are names themselves -- everything from shifts in ethnic patterns, to actors, actresses, athletes and singers who inspire new parents mulling over names, to people simply becoming tired of the sound of the old litany of names. Giving a child a name is perhaps the most personal decision a mother and father ever make. It is an act of absolute freedom. The government can't tell you what to name your child, your employers or extended family can't force your hand -- coming up with a name is a parent's first and biggest choice. One to be celebrated -- as is the country's constant impulse to evolve and start anew. There's no logical reason to long for the days of John and Mary, of Nancy and Joe. That train has left the station. Guided by its pair of trusty engineers, Jacob and Sophia. Currently the No. 1 names for the youngest members of the American family. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: The Social Security Administration keeps track of evolving baby naming trends .
He says for decades, ""standard"" American names held sway--your Tom, Dick, Nancy. Not now .

Greene: Ethnic, cultural shifts probably reason. Now: Joe? Say hi to Jayden. Mary? Meet Sophia ."
"(CNN) -- We just knew they were going to be huge stars, internationally famous, wealthy beyond imagining. It was summer's end, 1965. My buddies and I, along with hundreds of other people, gathered in the parking lot of the Northland shopping mall in Columbus, Ohio, to watch the Battle of the Bands. The bands were all local kids, just like us, and one of those bands -- the Dantes -- had something special going for it. The lead singer, 18-year-old Barry Hayden, possessed the onstage electricity, the lithe movements, the command of each moment, of a Midwestern Mick Jagger. You couldn't take your eyes off him. The band had a terrific, hard-driving new song called ""Can't Get Enough of Your Love"" (it pre-dated the smooth Barry White tune with similar wording), and the Dantes went to No. 1 with it on the hometown rock station, WCOL. We stood there on the surface of the parking lot and watched them in that summer's waning days, and we felt elevated just to be spending the afternoon in their presence. The Dantes would make two more records -- both of them Rolling Stones covers: ""Under My Thumb"" and ""Connection"" -- each of which also went to No. 1 on WCOL. They opened for Jimi Hendrix once at a show at Veterans Memorial auditorium in Columbus. But somehow, despite their talent, nothing happened for the Dantes nationally. Three years later, they disbanded. And Barry Hayden? We didn't know what became of him. As this summer of 2012 was winding down, I was visiting central Ohio and saw that on a Friday night, at a place in the town of Gahanna called the FM All-American Bar and Grill, there was going to be a band called the Professors (""fully tenured rock and roll"") playing. No cover charge, no minimum. The lead singer's name was Barry Hayden. So, just before 9 p.m., I walked in the door. I took a seat at the bar as the band was setting up. Barry came over to say hello. He's 65. He said that for the last 16 years he has worked a daytime job at the Ohio Statehouse, arranging guided tours for the public. He's had a number of other jobs, including work at the Honda assembly plant in Marysville, Ohio. ""What are you doing here?"" he said. ""Seeing you,"" I said. ""It's the end of the summer, isn't it?"" He grinned, and I told him about watching him sing, 47 summers ago, at the Battle of the Bands at Northland. ""You won,"" I said. ""We didn't win,"" he said. ""The Rebounds beat us. But that was a good thing, because it made us work harder. We won the next Battle of the Bands at Valley Dale."" We stood there laughing together, and he told me that all of the guys in the Professors do this mainly because they just like it so much. The youngest member of the band is in his mid-50s; most of them work regular jobs during the week and do this on the weekends. There's not a lot of money in it. ""I'd do it for free,"" Barry said. He had been away from music for decades, and he thought he had lost it forever. He was wrong. Three years ago, he formed this group. ""Better go play,"" he said. He, and the Professors, did. They were wonderful, from the tough, insistent first chords. All of the songs were ones made famous by the most renowned bands of their boyhoods: The Animals' ""We Gotta Get Out of This Place,"" the Byrds' ""Feel a Whole Lot Better,"" Dylan's ""Like a Rolling Stone,"" the Kinks' ""All Day and All of the Night,"" the Beatles' ""A Hard Day's Night."" To look into the faces of Barry and his new bandmates -- Bruce Roberts, Don Groner, Shane Sheaf and Billy Zenn -- was to see men who, far along in their lives, had given themselves, on this night, three hours of gladness. They were giving it to their audience, too. People were up and dancing, singing along. Later Barry would tell me: ""It's the one thing in my whole life that has ever made any sense. It's the one thing I'm good at. ""It's what I am."" He knows, now, that he will never be a rich man. He knows, now, that fame will not be arriving. But he has found this again, after fearing it was gone for good. And he has discovered an essential truth that all of us might do well to keep in mind: . Doing the thing you love -- finding, somehow, a way to do it -- should be mandatory. You shouldn't put it off -- if you wait, if you think you'll get around to it someday, someday may never come. As midnight approached in Gahanna, he was singing lead on the Rolling Stones' ""The Last Time"": . "". . .this could be the last time, this could be the last time. . . "" He asked, into the microphone, how the volume was. From the bar I caught his eye, smiled, and made a little clockwise motion with my thumb and forefinger. I pointed toward the ceiling. Meaning: Up. Louder. He sang: . "". . .may be the last time, I don't know. . . ."" None of us knows when that last time -- the last chance to do the thing we were meant to do, the thing that makes us whole -- will come. This is the last full weekend of summer. Next weekend, autumn begins. And opportunities for joy, like summer nights, are fleeting and finite.

"(CNN) -- What should most worry the leaders of the federal government -- the president, the top officials in Congress, Democrats, Republicans, everyone who failed to find a way to avoid the forced budget cuts? What should make them fully understand what the stakes of their ineffectuality really are? Those stakes, in the end, have little to do with numbers or dollar figures. The stakes are considerably more profound than that. A hint of what those stakes are can be found in an unlikely place -- a scene in the wonderful 1986 movie ""Hoosiers,"" about basketball in small-town Indiana. Early in the movie, one of the townspeople -- he's not very likeable, but his words are memorable -- confronts the newly arrived coach. The man says: . ""Look, mister. There's two kinds of dumb. Guy that gets naked and runs out in the snow and barks at the moon. . .and guy who does the same thing in my living room. ""First one don't matter. The second one, you're kind of forced to deal with."" Most of the time, official Washington can bark at the moon all it wants, and the nation merely shrugs. Barking at the moon, it often seems, is Washington's job description. But once in a while, the country feels that the barking has moved into America's living rooms -- that it's time to pay closer attention. And when the country decides, person by person, that the men and women they have elected are not up to the job, that's a tenuous place for the United States to be. Gergen: Americans sick of budget soap opera . The White House and members of Congress have known since the summer of 2011 that, unless they could come up with a way to reach a compromise â€” together, across party lines -- the mandatory, across-the-board budget cuts would kick in. They couldn't do it. They played a game, and the country lost. ""Brinksmanship,"" it's called. The term is one of bravado -- daring the other side to blink. In his recent book ""Ike's Bluff,"" journalist and historian Evan Thomas traces the term back to John Foster Dulles, President Dwight D. Eisenhower's secretary of state. Dulles took pride in bluffing Communist nations of that era to back down: ""If you run away from it, if you are scared to go to the brink, you are inevitably lost."" But if brinksmanship as a tool in international diplomacy is a risky proposition, brinksmanship as a constant, cynical tactic in domestic politics can make the citizens -- the voters -- resentful and angry. Voters don't want to hear why the men and women they elected can't get the job done. No one forced the elected officials to run for the offices they now hold. ""The U.S. governs by crisis these days,"" Richard McGregor and James Politi wrote last week in the Financial Times, ""and neither side seems capable of doing anything about it."" Both sides, in explaining their positions as the budget cuts were about to take effect, seemed to all but confirm that analysis. President Barack Obama, speaking to reporters at the White House, said: . ""So ultimately, if Mitch McConnell or John Boehner say, 'We need to go to catch a plane,' I can't have Secret Service block the doorway, right?"" McConnell, the Senate Minority Leader, said: ""But there will be no last-minute, back-room deal."" Yet last-minute deals, back-room or not, are what elected officials at the loftiest levels are supposed to be masters of. Brinksmanship doesn't work if the people at the wheels go hurtling over the brink. On South Michigan Avenue in Chicago there is a hotel, the Blackstone -- now a part of the Renaissance chain -- that is more than a century old. The Blackstone was where the political phrase ""smoke-filled room"" originated; in 1920, Warren G. Harding was chosen as the Republican candidate for president by a group of leaders meeting there to hammer out a consensus, even as the official convention was in session in a different part of town. A wire-service reporter wrote that the choice had been worked out ""in a smoke-filled room,"" and it became part of the language. It's probably sacrilege these days to say anything positive about decisions made privately in smoke-filled rooms (and the Blackstone is a no-smoking-anywhere-on-the-premises hotel today, anyway). But it's hard to imagine that many people would object if leaders of both parties locked themselves up in a room and didn't emerge until they had, at long last, fashioned a reasonable solution to the budget turmoil. It is, after all, what they are paid to do. Many members of Congress work in a pair of buildings named for men who, in an earlier era, understood that. The Rayburn House Office Building, named for longtime Democratic Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas, and the Dirksen Senate Office Building, named for longtime Republican Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois, recognize leaders of different parties and different ideologies who knew how, in the end, to cut through the mess and get things done. Meanwhile, as the first workweek of the forced budget cuts begins Monday, expect a familiar sound from Washington: . More barking at the moon. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Washington failed to find a way to avoid forced spending cuts .

"(CNN) -- When a group halfway around the world, without setting foot on American soil, can claim responsibility for preventing a man in Wichita, Kansas, or a woman in Shreveport, Louisiana, from gaining online access to his or her own money in the local bank, it would seem to be a pretty big deal. Something to worry about. That is allegedly what happened in recent weeks, as six big U.S. banks had their websites jammed, one after another, preventing their customers from logging on to their personal or business accounts, and from paying bills online. The banks affected were Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo and PNC. A hacker group, saying it was based in the Middle East, asserted it was behind the cyberattacks; it remains uncertain whether they, or someone else, carried out the attacks. And, last week, Politico reported: . ""White House Press Secretary Jay Carney downplayed a report that Chinese hackers had infiltrated a secure national security network used to control nuclear codes, saying the perpetrators breached an 'unclassified' system. ""There is 'no indication whatsoever that exfiltration of data' occurred, he told reporters. . . Such attacks, he added, 'are not infrequent.'"" Any time the prefix ""cyber"" appears in front of another word -- cybercrime; cyberterrorism; cyberwarfare -- it can have the effect of making the concept seem slightly less substantial. It's sort of like when the word ""virtual"" precedes a standard-issue noun: virtual reality is not reality; a virtual store is distinct from a brick-and-mortar operation. Opinion: Smartphone of the future will be in your brain . But as we live more and more of our lives online, and as basic needs such as electricity, water supply, transportation and communication depend increasingly on digital commands, the distinction is rapidly disappearing. Disrupt the digital world and you disrupt real lives -- you throw daily existence into uncharted territory. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, we were told that there had been ample warning signs that went unheeded. If there ever is a concerted and darkly effective cyberattack on the United States -- one that robs millions of people of baseline necessities -- we won't be able to say that no one told us this might someday happen. We have been told, for years. In 1997, according to a report in the New York Times that year, a White House commission found that the U.S. was vulnerable to computer-based attacks ""upon crucial industries like electrical power, telecommunications, transportation and significant centers of the economy."" The concern appeared to be shared by people on both sides of the political aisle. At a 2004 Senate subcommittee session, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said: ""We don't take cyberterrorism as seriously as we should. A terrorist could theoretically use a computer to open up floodgates of a dam, disrupt the operations of an aircraft control tower or shut down the New York Stock Exchange."" Republican Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, at the same hearing, said: ""We've seen reports that al Qaeda has explored the possibility of damaging some of our key computer systems, seeking to cripple electric power grids, transportation systems, even financial institutions. Just imagine what chaos would result if a cyberattack were coordinated with a more conventional strike, such as bombing a highly populated area and then tampering with emergency systems to thwart hospitals and first responders caring for wounded civilians."" Opinion: Bias in science holds women back . FBI Director Robert S. Mueller, at a speech in San Francisco earlier this year, said: ""State-sponsored hackers are patient and calculating. They have the time, the money and the resources to burrow in, and to wait. They may come and go, conducting reconnaissance and exfiltrating bits of seemingly innocuous information -- information that in the aggregate may be of high value."" The Department of Homeland Security operates programs that include the National Cyber Alert System, the National Cyber Response Coordination Group and a security exercise known as Cyber Storm. Yet with all this, most of us -- as thoroughly as we have come to depend upon digital technology -- don't have much of an idea about how it really works. If your car won't start, you may feel qualified to pop open the hood and try to figure out how to fix it; if your lights go out, you probably know where the fuse box is. Digital outages are more mysterious; when systems go dead, there is a feeling of low-grade helplessness, but usually the confidence that someone, somewhere, is working to bring them back to life. Thus, the specter of some future cyberattack is troubling precisely because most of us have little sense of how we would individually combat such an incident. Even the terminology is open to dispute. The other afternoon I reached Internet security expert Bruce Schneier in London, where he was attending a conference. I knew he was skeptical about what he considers the inflation of language surrounding computer-based threats, especially terms like ""cyber warfare."" Opinion: Dangerous new world of drones . ""War is bombs dropping on you,"" he told me. ""War is tanks in your city. War is not your computer being hacked. In any war, there will be a cyberspace component. Wars are fought on all fronts. And cybercrime -- crime -- happens a lot. But that is not war."" Still, as the New York Times reported from Aspen, Colorado, over the summer: . ""The top American military official responsible for defending the United States against cyberattacks said Thursday that there had been a 17-fold increase in computer attacks on American infrastructure between 2009 and 2011, initiated by criminal gangs, hackers and other nations. ""The assessment by Gen. Keith B. Alexander, who heads the National Security Agency and also the newly created United States Cyber Command, appears to be the government's first official acknowledgment of the pace at which America's electricity grids, water supplies, computer and cellphone networks and other infrastructure are coming under attack."" Meanwhile, there's the matter of those six major banks, and the customers who couldn't log on to get to their money. It may all be cyber, but it's starting to feel kind of real. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Six banks apparently were hacked recently, cutting customer access to money .

"(CNN) -- Pat Nixon had taken Mamie Eisenhower out to lunch. This was in the summer of 1973; the wife of one president and the widow of another talked quietly in the dining room of the United States Senate. I had traveled to Washington to cover the Senate Watergate hearings, which of course centered on the first lady's husband, and I had unexpectedly been invited to lunch by the other person at my table, which was just a few feet from where Mrs. Nixon and Mrs. Eisenhower were eating. ""What did you think?"" George McGovern asked me. He drank a cup of coffee and waited for his omelet to arrive. ""When you were riding the planes and looking at the crowds every day, did you think we'd lost it?"" George McGovern, an unabashed liberal voice, dies . Only one year before, he had been traveling the country campaigning nonstop, the Democratic candidate for president. He had hoped to be living in the White House. Now, in that summer of '73, having suffered a landslide defeat at the hands of Richard Nixon, he was a U.S. senator who had just come out of a routine and dreary agriculture subcommittee meeting which had lasted all morning and would resume after the lunch break. ""Did you think we never had a chance from the convention on?"" McGovern asked. The Nixon-McGovern campaign had been my first. McGovern had done his best to get to know the people assigned to cover him, even the neophytes, so I had been pleased that a year after his defeat he would take the time to get a bite to eat with me. He died on Sunday at age 90 in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the same town where he had made his concession speech to Nixon on a cold November night 40 years ago. In the sometimes unforgiving world of political acrimony -- left vs. right, conservative vs.liberal -- it is easy to reduce national candidates to cartoon figures. But whatever anyone may have thought of McGovern's ideology, he was an awfully good guy. And for those who casually categorized him as ""soft,"" as his political opponents sometimes did, I always offer the suggestion: Unless you flew 35 World War II combat missions over Nazi-occupied Europe as the pilot of a B-24 bomber, as he did, and were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for your valor, as he was, maybe you ought to hold up a little bit before you offhandedly call a man like McGovern soft. ""Because it was the crowds that convinced me that the polls were wrong,"" McGovern was saying at lunch. ""I simply couldn't conceive that the crowds could be so big and enthusiastic, and that the polls could be so drastically negative at the same time. That's the one thing that still puzzles me a little."" Opinion: McGovern ahead of his time . The setting for this conversation bordered on the surreal. McGovern had spent that whole doomed campaign trying in vain to convince the country that he, not Nixon, should be president. Now, in the Senate Dining Room, not only were Mrs. Nixon and Mrs. Eisenhower sitting across the way, but also at nearby tables having lunch were three men who were gaining enormous celebrity as members of the Watergate committee, which was in the midst of holding its nationally televised hearings in the Senate Caucus Room: Sam Ervin of North Carolina, Howard Baker of Tennessee and Lowell Weicker of Connecticut. The country's eyes were riveted on them every day, on every broadcast network. ""No, I really haven't watched the Watergate hearings too much,"" McGovern said. ""Oh, once in a while when I go into the Senate cloakroom the TV set in there is turned on, and I watch it for a few minutes. But I don't watch the reruns at night. It's kind of hard for me to watch the hearings anyway; I guess I feel a little more personally involved in what they're about than most people do."" The night before, he told me, he had been invited to a party at which President Nixon had also been a guest. It was the first time he had encountered Nixon in person since the election. In the receiving line, when the two had come face to face, both men smiled broadly, if uneasily, and news photographers snapped pictures of the moment. ""As soon as I was invited to that party,"" McGovern said, ""I knew the situation was going to come up. ... I didn't think that was the picture they'd take. There was another time when Nixon and (then-National Security Adviser Henry) Kissinger and I were all going to be standing together, and I figured that was the picture they'd take. ... What did people expect me to do when I got to Nixon? Do this?"" Politicians pay tribute . McGovern scowled comically and began waving his finger in the air, as if scolding Nixon. ""Couldn't very well do that,"" he said, laughing. The news stories about McGovern's passing said that death came to him at the Dougherty Hospice House in Sioux Falls. When I saw that, I had a feeling. I looked it up. A man named Bill Dougherty was one of McGovern's dear South Dakota friends. He had risen to the position of lieutenant governor of the state; he was with McGovern to offer consolation on that night in Sioux Falls when the election results came in. Dougherty died in 2010; the hospice facility was named in his honor. So McGovern spent the last days of his life back in South Dakota, within the welcoming walls of a building bearing the name of his old friend. Home, and friendship: sustaining and real in a way that vote totals and lofty titles can never compete with. If you're lucky, that is. George McGovern was. Highlights of McGovern's life .

"(CNN) -- It is the implicit bargain every moviegoer makes. You buy your ticket, you go into an auditorium full of people you don't know, you look toward the front of the room, the lights go down -- and in the darkness, you are safe. On the screen in front of you, startling things may be going on: gunfights, automobile wrecks, romances suddenly turned dramatically ugly. You have willingly suspended disbelief; for two hours, you have voluntarily joined into the story looming so large in front of your eyes that you have pushed aside the fact that you are still just you sitting in a room in your town. The most dangerous things can be taking place in the front of that room, yet you are secure and protected. There is a cocoon that the moviegoing experience provides, and every time you step into a theater you are back inside of it. Entertainment: Shooting casts pall over 'Dark Knight Rises' Of all the haunting thoughts that have accompanied the tragedy this weekend in Aurora, Colorado, one of the hardest to shake is that of all the people who -- as they had always done at the movies -- were sitting in their seats in the minutes before the lights dimmed, staring straight ahead, and hoping that something good will come of the night. That word -- hope -- is one that is forever attached to the act of going to the movies. Roger Ebert, a friend of 40 years, once told me that no matter how many movies he has seen, he always enters a theater hoping that by the time he emerges into the light of the mundane workaday world something will have happened on the screen at the front of the theater to make him glad that he has spent the time. If you don't walk into a movie theater hoping, then there is no reason to make the trip. So the thought of those men and women in Colorado leaving their homes Thursday evening, the thought of them making their way down the aisle and choosing their seats and, with anticipation of something pleasurable, of something memorable, settling in and casting their eyes upon the screen. . . . The thought of that is heartbreaking precisely because the rest of us can all imagine it. We've all been there. Living: Infants too young for late-night movies? The one thing you would never expect -- that someone with murder in his heart will be looking back toward all the eyes, will be standing in the one place no one is supposed to stand, will be peering away from the screen and into that roomful of hopeful faces -- is what makes the thought of what happened almost unbearable. What is the phrase that every parent has told a nervous child when things on the screen become a little scary? ""It's only a movie."" What is the variation of that phrase that Hollywood studios have used to entice ticket buyers to horror films? ""You'll have to keep telling yourself, 'It's only a movie.'"" No one is supposed to intrude upon the space between the audience and the screen. To do so would be to shatter the illusion. News: Life and death decisions in Aurora theater . It was shattered in unthinkable ways in Colorado this week. There is an old Life magazine photo, taken to illustrate the magic of the movies, that is so glorious because it shows the one scene that moviegoers never witness. The photographer positioned his camera at the front of a movie theater and snapped the shutter as all of the people in the seats are gazing upward at the story on the screen.

"(CNN) -- There will be a good deal of public singing these next few days, during the parties, celebrations and services surrounding the inauguration, and at the inaugural ceremonies themselves. Democrats and Republicans alike will join voices and sing ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" ""God Bless America"" and other patriotic songs. Politicians and regular citizens, regardless of where they align themselves along the liberal-conservative continuum, have long been able to put aside their differences as they blend their voices for certain time-honored lyrics: . ""My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty..."" ""O beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain..."" But the song that is the centerpiece of every inauguration, and of virtually every formal public appearance by a president of the United States, will be heard instrumentally these next few days -- yet will not be sung. The song is ""Hail to the Chief."" Most people are probably unaware that it even has lyrics. We're accustomed to hearing the United States Marine Band play the stirring, brass-heavy chords as the president comes into sight. Why are the words to the song seldom sung? When you read them, it's easy to surmise one possible reason. In our hyper-partisan times, it would be unrealistic to assume that members of the party out of power would want to enthusiastically belt them out. Take this year, for example. Try to envision the television pictures of Inauguration Day, were ""Hail to the Chief"" expected to be sung by all the attendees. President Obama appears from inside the Capitol, some of the TV cameras focus on Republican congressional leaders John Boehner or Mitch McConnell or Eric Cantor -- and they are presumed to wish to ardently vocalize: . ""Hail to the Chief we have chosen for the nation, . Hail to the Chief! We salute him, one and all, . Hail to the Chief, as we pledge cooperation . In proud fulfillment of a great, noble call. Yours is the aim to make this grand country grander, . This you will do, that's our strong, firm belief. Hail to the one we selected as commander, . Hail to the President! Hail to the Chief!"" Yes, those are the lyrics to ""Hail to the Chief"" -- and it's no wonder that few people have ever heard them. They express a lovely all-American sentiment, but--especially in our superheated political climate-- they possess the potential for some pretty awkward moments of public crooning. Go back a few years. Try to picture, during the administration of George W. Bush, the trio of Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and then-Sen. Barack Obama raising their voices in song to warble in Bush's direction: ""Hail to the Chief, as we pledge cooperation..."" Or imagine, during Bill Clinton's time in office, the sight and sound of Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole and Trent Lott harmonizing as they gaze at Clinton: ""Yours is the aim to make this country grander/This you will do, that's our strong, firm belief..."" If, in these political times, the words to ""Hail to the Chief"" sound a little odd, the history of the song is also not short on oddity. The phrase -- ""Hail to the Chief"" -- originated in Scotland in 1810 as part of a poem by Sir Walter Scott. The poem, ""The Lady of the Lake,"" had nothing to do with the United States, or with the presidency. But the story told in the poem's plot became a British stage play that made it across the ocean within a few years. Among the songs that came to the United States as part of the play was ""Hail to the Chief,"" written by James Sanderson. It was given new lyrics to honor the presidency, and reportedly was used in that context for the first time at an 1815 ceremony to commemorate the birthday of George Washington. It was played at the inaugurations of Presidents Martin Van Buren in 1837 and John Tyler in 1841, according to historians, and during the administration of President James Polk from 1845 to 1849 it became routinely played any time the president entered a room during public occasions. Not everyone was in love with the song. President Chester A. Arthur, who served from 1881 to 1885, directed the leader of the Marine Band to compose a new one to replace it. Fortunately for Arthur, the leader of the Marine Band at the time was a pretty fair songwriter -- a young Marine sergeant major by the name of John Philip Sousa. He came up with a new tune called ""Presidential Polonaise."" Unfortunately for ""Presidential Polonaise,"" it never caught on, and ""Hail to the Chief"" made a return. Sousa was undeterred; he would go on to write, among other patriotic classics, ""The Stars and Stripes Forever."" President Jimmy Carter, in seeking to make the trappings of his presidency a little less regal, asked that ""Hail to the Chief"" not be played when he made public entrances. This turned out to be a highly unpopular decision. Carter would later tell CBS News: ""One of the most unpleasant things that surprised me was when I quit having 'Hail to the Chief' every time I entered a room, but there was an outcry of condemnation."" Before long, ""Hail to the Chief"" was back. The Marine Band continues to play it as presidents make their entrances. The words, however, continue to mostly go unsung, and that will almost certainly be the case during the inaugural festivities these next few days. In the spirit of the history of this -- and as a nod to what might have been -- we leave you with a parting gift of music. On behalf of Chester A. Arthur, please click and enjoy the song you never got the chance to tap your feet to. Ladies and gentlemen, the Mount Prospect, Illinois, Community Band performs, for your listening pleasure, ""Presidential Polonaise."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Patriotic songs sung at inauguration won't include ""Hail to the Chief""
That song is usually played, not sung. The lyrics might not fly in the political moment, he says .
Imagine Boehner joining in to ""Hail to the Chief, as we pledge cooperation...,"" he says .
Greene: Song has come and gone for presidential entrances; words remain unsung ."
"(CNN) -- Taking attendance. That is the phrase used by the parent of a Sandy Hook Elementary School student, describing to a reporter what went on in the firehouse near the school as terrified mothers and fathers arrived in the minutes and hours after the shootings. The mothers and fathers looked anxiously for children who had lived through the shootings and had been brought into the firehouse. The surviving children and their parents found each other. But the other parents waited and waited. Their sons and daughters did not appear. And as the mothers and fathers who had been reunited with their children left the firehouse to go to their homes, a list began to be compiled. On it were the names of the boys and girls who were not accounted for. The most heart-shattering and unbearable list that can be imagined. Those 20 children, as they had left home for school earlier that day, were boys and girls who had favorite television shows, and Christmas wish lists, and jokes that only they and their families understood, and brothers and sisters they knew they'd be having dinner with. And parents, who now waited in the rapidly emptying Sandy Hook Volunteer Fire and Rescue station. There are days when it seems fair to ask if part of American life has gone irretrievably insane. A description of the scene inside the elementary school, from a law enforcement official who spoke to a reporter, was that it resembled ""a killing field."" That is a term of warfare, even of genocide, yet it seems not at all out of place in the context of contemporary domestic news. ""We have lockdown drills,"" said Mary Ann Jacob, a library clerk at the school. She was explaining to reporters that the teachers, children and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary, like teachers, children and staff at elementary schools all across the United States, were well versed in the advisability of preparing for a day like Friday. Lockdown drills. More than half-a-century ago, children in elementary schools were trained in so-called duck-and-cover drills: the practice of diving under desks in case of nuclear attack by foreign enemies. Even at the time, it felt kind of comical; few boys and girls really believed that enemy aircraft were going to materialize over Midwestern or Southern or West Coast skies, bearing atomic payloads -- and a schoolroom desk, even in children's eyes, didn't promise much of a shelter against a bomb. American children tended to laugh and kid through the drills. Today's enemies seem considerably more real, and the children are taught to understand that. ""The kids knew the routine,"" the librarian said. Thus, with the gunman in the school, she led the boys and girls to the lockdown-drill location: ""between some bookcases and a wall, where you can't be seen from any windows."" And, because they were children, and not soldiers trained in responding to heavy weaponry, when she and her colleagues then led the children to a storeroom and locked the door, she did the only thing she could to calm them as shots rang through the school: . Passed out crayons and paper. We tend to talk about terrorism in terms of potential attacks from foreign shores, but on weekends like this one we have to acknowledge that the specter of terror seems to have become a part of the very atmosphere of American life. At a movie theater in Colorado, a shopping mall in Oregon, a school in a quiet Connecticut town ... the places change, the news media gather after the bloodshed, the police piece together the sequence of events, the grief counselors mobilize. And somehow it all feels like flailing. At the end of a weekend like this one, do we feel at all secure that, having learned what we can about what has happened, the knowledge will help to prevent the next day and place of carnage? Of course not. There is an old movie that is often played on television during the holiday season; its very title bears a message of warmth and safety and affectionate December memories. ""Christmas in Connecticut,"" the movie is called, and the words are meant to comfort and cheer. It was broadcast again nationally late last week as America settled in for what is supposed to be a season of kindness and gentle spirit. By the weekend in Connecticut, a law enforcement official, preparing to release the identities of the children who died, said that his colleagues were carefully compiling ""a formal list of names, birthdates and information."" A resident of Newtown told a television reporter: ""Things like this just aren't supposed to happen here."" No, they aren't. And ""here"" means not just Newtown, not just Connecticut, but this country we all share. It's not supposed to happen here. Yet it does, again and again. And, in a season of peace, a strong, no-longer-young nation, blessed with so many people of compassion and wisdom and good will, finds itself in a bleak and familiar place -- unable to answer the most basic question of all: . Why? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene describes parents' heartbreaking wait for kids, many of whom didn't arrive .
Greene: There are days we want to ask: Has America gone insane?
He says the joke of duck-and-cover drills has given way to deadly serious lockdown drills .

"(CNN) -- What must it be like to step to the plate for your first appearance as a major-league baseball player and knock a grand-slam home run into the far reaches of the seats in Yankee Stadium? Or to walk onto a National Football League field for the first time in your life, receive a kickoff while standing in the end zone, and return it 103 yards for a touchdown? Very few people know that feeling-- the feeling of, against all probability, achieving magnificence on the very first try. But Andy Griffith did. When he died earlier this month at the age of 86, most of the obituaries and remembrances were centered on his role as the lovable, quietly wise Sheriff Andy Taylor in the long-running television series ""The Andy Griffith Show."" Which only made sense: that program, and that character, were so popular that when people hear Griffith's name, they almost automatically also hear in their heads the peppy, whistling theme music from the show. He, and the show, symbolized a sunny America that thrived on common sense and good intentions. Yet, in the minds of some of us, Griffith's crowning achievement came at the outset of his career, the first time he appeared in a motion picture. The job he did was so stunning -- and so directly opposite in tone from the Sheriff Andy character that would later define him -- that watching the movie today is a revelation. The movie was called ""A Face in the Crowd."" Those of you who have seen it are likely nodding your heads in appreciation right now; those of you who haven't are in for a treat. You thought you knew how good the guy was at his job? Just wait. You won't have to wait long. As part of a tribute to Griffith's career, Turner Classic Movies is presenting a special airing of ""A Face in the Crowd"" Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET. TCM and CNN are corporate siblings, but I would be recommending ""A Face in the Crowd"" to you if I'd heard it was being screened in a church basement, or in the most rundown revival theater on some desolate downtown corner. Released in 1957, the movie told the story of Larry ""Lonesome"" Rhodes, a drifter we first see in a rural Arkansas jail cell. He is interviewed by a small-town radio reporter played by Patricia Neal, and the film follows his rise to radio, and then television, stardom, and what eventually transpires. Griffith made audiences love him as the kindly Sheriff Andy of Mayberry; as Lonesome Rhodes, he had the courage as an actor to dare audiences to hate him. You cannot take your eyes off him. In his May 29, 1957, review of the movie in the New York Times, critic Bosley Crowther wrote that screenwriter Budd Schulberg and director Elia Kazan had managed to ""spawn a monster not unlike the one of Dr. Frankenstein."" And as you watch the first-time movie actor Griffith, Crowther wrote, ""you know you are in the vicinity of someone who has white lightning for blood."" Budd Schulberg was on a remarkable three-year run at the time; between 1954 and 1957 he had a hand in three unforgettable movies about the dark side of American life: ""On the Waterfront"" with Marlon Brando, ""The Harder They Fall"" with Humphrey Bogart, and ""A Face in the Crowd."" As laceratingly first-rate as Schulberg's writing and Kazan's direction were, the film would not have worked had the lead actor failed to be convincing as a person whose hungers were so self-centered and all-consuming that he would do anything and step on anyone to get what he wanted. Griffith pulled it off seamlessly: As you watch him, you understand how the smiling, aw-shucks, I'm-just-a-country-boy Lonesome Rhodes could cynically use the then-new medium of national television to become as powerful as the president, while privately holding his viewers in utter contempt. Griffith looms physically large, and his menacing grin springs from the screen; this is, at its core, a horror movie, and Griffith plays it as such from the first frame in which we see him. The movie did only tepid business upon its release, and -- in retrospect, this is astonishing -- was not nominated for a single Academy Award. The next year Griffith starred in the amiable military comedy ""No Time for Sergeants,"" and by 1960 ""The Andy Griffith Show"" was on network television and he was on his way to sweet, gentle fame, under blue skies and white clouds. As America says goodbye to him, and to his worthy acting career, I hope -- especially if you have never seen it -- that you'll take the time to watch him in ""A Face in the Crowd,"" filmed before his own face had become universally recognizable. You'll not only be honoring his life. You will be doing something that none of us, when given the opportunity, should ever pass up: . Witnessing greatness. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andy Griffith.","Bob Greene: When Andy Griffith died, most recalled him as the aw-shucks Sherriff Andy Taylor .
But a stunning performance he gave earlier in his first film was the antithesis of his TV role .
In ""A Face in the Crowd"" Griffith played a drifter-turned-star, an oily, monstrous character .

"(CNN) -- The startling thing, in the long run, is not that the power went out and stayed out in so many parts of the United States during the week just ended. The startling thing is what we so casually take for granted: . Flip a switch, and the lights in your home instantly blaze to life. Turn a knob, and clean water comes rushing into your sink or bathtub. Pick up a telephone, and you're talking with someone halfway across the country or halfway around the world. News: Cold front expected to bring relief from heat, but also storms . Right now, the most pressing matter is to get the electricity back on in the places that are still without it. People are in despair; people have died. Fierce storms, along with near-record-high temperatures, combined during the final days of June and the first week of July to bring down multiple power systems and leave millions of people sweltering in the dark. But once all is up and running again, it might be good to pause and think about how fragile all of our assumptions are. For much of the time that the continental United States has been a part of the planet, few of the life-easing developments we nonchalantly take on faith seemed remotely possible. Electricity? Running water? Air conditioning? They were the stuff of science-fiction novels. Ours was a land mass of forests and rivers and deserts and plains, a tangled and disconnected tableau that disappeared from view with the blackness of night. We -- not you and I, but our ancestors -- figured out how to change all that. By the time recent generations came along, everything seemed so endlessly convenient. The battle for civilization had been won. Which is why a week like the one just past is such a sobering reminder that we are always just an unanticipated disaster away from a trip into the primitive America that existed before. Doubt it? Ask your fellow citizens who waited and waited for someone to turn their lights back on last week. News: Resilient West Virginians brave storms and their aftermath . In the blast-oven heat that stifled much of the nation in recent days, the absence of air conditioning felt anguishing. But that situation was, for most of America's history, so commonplace as to be unremarkable. Summers were for sweating, and for drawing the blinds, and for sleeping on porches. It wasn't until the 1920s that movie theaters featured early versions of air conditioners, which proved to be an enormous draw for the public who yearned to escape their broiling homes. Department stores in the 1930s lured customers by offering them a chilled-air respite from the scorching hours they spent in their houses. News: Gadgets to help you survive a power outage . According to the Carrier Corp., the pioneering air-conditioning manufacturer, as late as 1960 few college buildings featured air conditioning, and virtually no elementary or high schools had it. Private residences? For the most part, they were the last to convert. Window units were available, but by 1965, according to Carrier, only one out of 10 U.S. homes had central air. But when our daily lives change for the better, human nature lulls us into all but forgetting what preceded. We don't even question the marvelous advances that once seemed out of reach. One of the funniest -- yet most perceptive and provocative -- news-conference questions I've ever been aware of was asked in the 1970s by Ron Powers, who was then the brilliant young television critic of the Chicago Sun-Times. If memory serves, the event was some sort of press gathering organized by CBS to discuss the network's upcoming schedule. After the preliminary announcements, the floor was opened for questions. Many of the reporters in attendance asked about the stars of the new shows, and about ratings trends, and about programming decisions. News: Use caution if you drive in extreme heat . Then Powers raised his hand, and asked: . ""How do you make the pictures go through the air?"" As delightful as his telling of the story was back then, I thought of it again last week, in a much more serious context. How do the essential things in which we place our confidence really get done? And are we right to think we can forever count on them? The uneasiness and fear when the power went out last week extended beyond the nuts and bolts of engineering; instead, it was almost primal. It was a reminder of the unthinkable, of scenarios as potentially nightmarish as a sneak attack by foreign enemies. It was an unwelcome premonition of things we don't even want to consider: . We flick the light switch, and nothing happens. We twist the knob on the faucet, and nothing emerges. We punch a number into the telephone, and hear only silence. We turn on our computers, and are greeted by blankness. And then, darkness falls. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Parts of U.S. lost power; we should reflect on how we take comfort for granted .

"(CNN) -- If the furnace in your basement stopped working, and you hired a company to repair it, what would you do if several of the workers came upstairs, told you they couldn't figure out how to get the furnace started, and then began pointing fingers at each other and saying: . ""It's his fault."" ""No, it's his fault."" ""If he'd listen to me, we could get this job done."" ""He tries to stop me every time I'm on the verge of fixing your furnace."" You'd probably stand there slack-jawed, hardly believing what you were witnessing. Then you'd say: . ""I don't want to hear you guys blaming each other. I'm paying you to do a job. Just go back down there and do it, or if you can't, get out of my house."" Or if you had a leak in your plumbing, and the plumbers emerged from under your sink to tell you: . ""I'm sorry -- I can't work with this man. He undoes everything I'm trying to do to get your pipes back in shape."" ""So typical of him to put the blame on me. He's got it exactly backward. I know how to stop the leak -- he has no idea. And he never has."" You'd tell them that this is not what you hired them to do. Why are they wasting your time and money telling you that it's the other guy's fault that the water is still dripping onto your floor? You'd ask them to keep their personal animosities to themselves and figure out a way to complete the job they'd agreed to do, or else you're not going to give them a cent. You'd be well within your rights. When work needs to be done, you hire people who promise that they know how to do it, and you expect to get what you paid for. You are the employer; you are the boss. But in one area, this doesn't seem to be the case. In politics and government, almost all Americans agree on the tasks that urgently need to be completed. A few of them: . â€¢ Creating jobs so that finding meaningful employment can stop feeling like pursuing an all-but-unattainable luxury. â€¢ A fair solution to health care, that compassionate people along every station of the right/left continuum can live with and be proud of. â€¢ Fixing the fallout from the big-bank machinations and the mortgage crisis that have cost so many people their homes. Addressing these problems is a task beyond any of us as individuals. So, in the same way we hire workers to repair the furnace or plug the leak under the sink, we hire workers to fix the big national problems. They have lofty titles and work in buildings made of white marble. We hire our presidents, our members of Congress, and, indirectly, our justices of the United States Supreme Court. And maybe it is time to remind ourselves -- and to remind them -- that they are, in fact, hired hands. They are being paid to do a job. They are not being paid to tell their employers -- the citizens -- why they can't get the job done, or why they can't get along with the other hired hands who are supposed to be working beside them. Only in politics and government, when the hired hands come up short, are they allowed to get away with flicking spitballs at each other as the country waits for results -- spitballs in the form of purportedly clever attack lines packaged and issued by advisers, meant to wound the other side, yet doing nothing to further the completion of the jobs at hand. Whether, individually, we are conservatives or liberals or somewhere in the middle, we have a right to expect the people who have been hired to solve the country's problems to do just that, and to spare us the name-calling and blame-shifting. We wouldn't accept that from electricians or auto mechanics; there is no reason to accept it from men and women with federal titles. There is a self-congratulatory phrase that political pros like to throw around: ""Politics ain't beanbag."" But these days, that's what it increasingly can feel like: a childish game played by people so enamored of the game itself that the playing of it pushes aside the real-world consequences. Those real-world consequences matter -- they matter desperately. And the people who should be the demanding employers -- the citizens -- are tossed about in the heavy waves of the political storm, as if they are mere bystanders who have no standing in all of this. There is another phrase, used as the title of a song by the young Bob Dylan in the years before his name became known all over the world. In a different context from the issues we face now, Dylan called his song ""Only a Pawn in Their Game."" It would be hard to blame Americans today if they sometimes identify with that phrase. But they shouldn't have to settle for feeling like pawns. And this is not a game. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: If you hired people to fix your furnace and they couldn't agree, you'd fire them .
He says similarly, government officials, whose salaries we pay, must show results .
He says only in politics can people get paid for fighting among themselves .

"(CNN) -- So there he was, sitting on the queen's bed, wearing a soiled T-shirt and jeans, holding a broken ashtray and bleeding from a cut on his hand: . A man named Michael Fagan, who was 31 at the time, had climbed a wall of Buckingham Palace, crawled through an open window and made his way to the bedroom of Queen Elizabeth II, who was sleeping. When she awakened to find the guy sitting there staring at her, it is fair to surmise that she was not pleased. Especially when Fagan asked her if she had a spare cigarette. This happened on July 9, 1982, generating international headlines, and only because the queen survived unharmed does it read like a comedy of errors. The errors were plentiful, including the queen's repeated attempts to summon help, at first to no avail. But now, 30 years later, during the celebration of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in London this week, it is instructive to recall the monarch's rude awakening by the bleeding intruder who was in search of a smoke. We assume that the handful of people at the absolute pinnacle of life -- the queen being the lead example -- have the means and the staffs and the security teams to insulate themselves from indignities that mere mortals have to put up with. Analysis: Why Queen Elizabeth's jubilee celebrations matter to Brits . And, most of the time, they do. But when there are breaches of presumed privacy, boy, does it cause a commotion. Follow CNN's live jubilee blog . We don't have to go back in history to look for instances of this. Just consider what Pope Benedict XVI is thinking right now in the wake of the news that his butler, Paolo Gabriele, has been arrested, accused of having the pope's confidential documents in his home. The investigation is still playing out in Rome, but if the allegations prove true and it turns out that Gabriele, one of the few people who had access to the pope's living quarters, including the pope's desk, lifted the information, then the pope will know with certainty that even with his rarified position, he can't count on personal privacy behind the guarded walls of the Vatican. In the United States, President Ronald Reagan, after an assassination attempt on a Washington sidewalk in the second month of his first term, was assured that efforts would be redoubled to make certain no one who wished to hurt him would be able to get that close again. Nancy Reagan was said to be especially adamant that her husband be kept out of harm's way. So it was almost beyond belief one afternoon in April 1992 when Reagan, out of office but still being protected by the Secret Service, was in Las Vegas to receive an award and was accosted right onstage. Reagan had just been given the award -- a 2-foot-high crystal statue of an eagle -- when a man named Richard Paul Springer, 41, walked through the ring of security around the former president and onto the stage, grabbed the crystal eagle, smashed it forcefully to the floor (with Reagan being struck by the flying glass), and commandeered the microphone. Reagan was hustled offstage by the Secret Service, and Springer, too, was hauled away. But there was widespread incredulity that someone could get past all the federal, local and private security that is always on hand for an appearance by a president or former president. Some breaches are more comical than frightening. Elvis Presley was famously kept away from the gazes and grasping hands of his admirers when he was not performing. His privacy at home was especially important to him. But his old friends and employees sometimes tell the story of what happened when a crate arrived at his home with ventilation holes punched into it. The delivery service said that fans had sent him, as a gift, a top-pedigree dog. So, according to the story, the crate was carted into the house, and was opened. Out climbed two young women. They were escorted off the property. The persistence of those who infringe upon the privacy of the exalted can be astonishing. It turned out that Michael Fagan, the queen's uninvited visitor, had managed to sneak into Buckingham Palace a month earlier and had helped himself to a bottle of wine. For that he was charged with theft -- but was not charged criminally for the subsequent trespass that took him to her sleeping quarters, because at the time it was considered a civil violation. And Squeaky Fromme, sent to prison for a failed assassination attempt on President Gerald Ford in 1975, wrote to him while she was incarcerated -- a letter described as ""strange"" by Ford. She was able to reach the president once he had left office -- the letter made it to his home, and he read it -- even while she was locked away from society. The oddity of these encounters that happen when the personal space of the most protected people on the planet is violated -- the bizarreness of the moments when they are reminded that nothing in life is guaranteed -- can be both mesmerizing and haunting. Just ask Queen Elizabeth, in the unlikely event you ever get close enough. But you probably shouldn't ask her for a cigarette.","Bob Greene: In 1982 a man got past everyone at Buckingham palace into the queen's bedroom .

"(CNN) -- All eyes are on London this summer. The Olympic Games begin next month; earlier this month, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee provided glorious pictures and joyous sounds to the watching world. The history and beauty of the great city are being much discussed, and with good reason. London is a bedrock of civilized society, a touchstone for commerce, culture and statecraft down through the centuries. But while all the grand moments in London's, and England's, history are being revisited this summer, there is one rather important event that is likely to be ignored. Its 70th anniversary is this week. And anyone who loves London, or who loves freedom, might want to contemplate it. Seventy years ago -- in the last week of June in 1942 -- an American from Midwestern farm country arrived in besieged London. Prince William: 30 years in photos . It was a business trip, of sorts. The man's bosses had assigned him a daunting task. Summed up in a few words, that task was: . Save the world. England, and free Europe, were under terrible peril at the hands of Germany's Third Reich. The British people and the British military had shown extraordinary valor, but it was not going to be enough. They needed help. And so, on that day in late June, Dwight D. Eisenhower of Abilene, Kansas arrived in London with the new title of commanding general of the European Theater of Operations. Adolf Hitler didn't realize it at the time, but Ike's arrival in London meant that he was through. It had been a year of loss and mourning for Eisenhower. Little over three months before, his father, who among other jobs had worked at an Abilene creamery, had died. Ike could not leave his post in Washington as deputy to Army Chief of Staff Gen.

But for 30 minutes on that day, he closed the door of his office and wrote, in longhand, in his diary: . ""My father was buried today. ... He was a just man, well liked, a thinker. He was undemonstrative, quiet, modest, and of exemplary habits -- he never used alcohol or tobacco. ... His finest monument is his reputation in Abilene and Dickinson County. ... His word has been his bond and accepted as such. ... I'm proud he was my father. My only regret is that it was always so difficult to let him know the great depth of my affection for him."" Later that evening, Eisenhower realized he had not committed the extent of his grief to paper. He wrote in the diary: . ""I have felt terribly. I should like so much to be with my mother these few days. But we're at war. And war is not soft -- it has no time to indulge even the deepest and most sacred emotions. I loved my Dad. ... Quitting work now -- 7:30 p.m. I haven't the heart to go on tonight."" But by June, he did go on, with the assignment of commanding all the Yanks in Europe. The invasion of North Africa would soon follow. Then, having been promoted to supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, Eisenhower would direct the largest combined sea, air and land military undertaking in the history of the world: Operation Overlord, the D-Day invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe. Feature: British monarchy's long-lasting love affair with the sea . England, and Europe, and the free world would survive and prevail. All was not easy; every decision was not without its critics, both at the time and in the ensuing years. Some strategies did not work out the way he had hoped and planned for. Eisenhower himself realized this, and was at peace with it. After the war, remembering his arrival in London, he would write: . ""War, as so many men have said, is the most stupid and tragic of human ventures. It is stupid because so few problems are enduringly solved; tragic because its cost in lives and spirit and treasure is seldom matched in the fruits of victory. Still, I never intend to join myself with those who damn all wars as vile crimes against humanity. World War II, not sought by the people of the United States or its allies, was certainly not, on their part, either stupid or in vain. Satisfaction, and memories precious beyond price, rewarded those who survived and who, in loyalty to country and to ideals, answered the attack."" In that summer of 1942, England's Princess Elizabeth was 16 years old. Eleven years later, in 1953, coronation ceremonies would officially bestow upon her the crown of the queen. Also in 1953, inaugural ceremonies in Washington would officially swear in Eisenhower as president of the United States. Diamond Jubilee coverage: How William, Kate and Harry made royals cool . London will glitter on the world stage this summer. The famous phrase will be heard often: ""There'll always be an England."" But that was not so certain, 70 years ago. During the royal jubilee this month, the moving anthem beloved by the British people was played and sung many times: . ""God Save the Queen."" In the United States, we don't have royalty. But on occasion, we have majesty. And in this London summer -- a summer in a great city, free and proud -- perhaps there will be a few people who will pause if only for a moment to recall what once transpired, and who will close their eyes and offer the silent thought: . May God bless the memory of Dwight David Eisenhower.

"(CNN) -- It is such a cruel disease, one that can sneak up on a person and catch him unawares. The last time I saw Bobby Vee, he seemed just fine. The name will be familiar to many of you, but today's column is intended just as much for those readers who are too young to remember him. He was one of the young rock-and-roll idols of the early 1960s. His hits included ""Take Good Care of My Baby,"" ""The Night Has a Thousand Eyes,"" ""Run to Him"" and ""Rubber Ball."" He continued to tour as the years went by. We were on an Italian ocean liner in the first weeks of 2009. The ship had been booked by a company presenting a different early-years-of-rock act in concert each evening in the big theater onboard. Bobby was one of the performers; I was there with the Jan and Dean band. One midnight after the show, somewhere off the coast of the Dominican Republic, I was walking around an upper deck and saw that Bobby was taking a walk, too. We met up and talked about some of his first recordings. His recall was precise and acute; he gave me details of what the sessions had been like. He is a gentleman, and a gentle man. Walking and talking with him was a wonderful way to end the day at sea. So I was startled to hear recently that he is battling Alzheimer's disease, the irreversible, progressive brain disorder that destroys memory and thinking skills. It is estimated that more than 5 million Americans suffer from it, a number that is only expected to increase unless advances in treatment and prevention are achieved. The federal government recently announced new initiatives that, it is hoped, will add urgency to the efforts. The millions of families dealing with Alzheimer's are aware of its devastation. But when people with familiar names -- Ronald Reagan, Glen Campbell -- are blindsided by it, the world tends to stop, and think, and try to learn. What we can learn from Bobby Vee is how to face adversity with genuine grace and perspective. He is 69; in a letter to his friends and fans, he said that it was a little over a year ago that he was diagnosed with the initial stages of Alzheimer's. Getting the news, he said, ""was a moment that stunned my family and myself to the core. Since this time I have chosen to remain private and to focus on what is most important to me: my family and my music. It has been a time to reflect and to just be. To create memories for my grandchildren and to celebrate life's goodness. To throw baseballs and catch fish. To be the audience. ... ""Shortly after this all came down, I hopped into an RV with my family and we embarked on a little odyssey from Minnesota to Tucson, AZ. Together we explored the depths of our reality. ... the depths of my reality. With very few words, no solutions and a lot of heart, we did what we do. We shared time. We shared laughter, tears, stories, meals and music. We shared thousands of miles of hi-way as familiar to us as the pillows on our beds. As if nothing had changed, as if everything had changed. ... ""So without a song or a script I am stepping onto a stage that we all share: the mystery of life. While in Tucson we set up some amps and drums in the garage ... We just did what we have always done, only this time there was no stage. There were no spotlights and no audience. We made music every day for a week ... just for us. For the joy of making music. For the joy of being together. For all of the reasons I ever picked up a guitar or sang a tune in a Fargo, N.D. garage back in '59. I have truly come full circle! We played songs I grew up with, songs the kids grew up with, songs we wrote, songs that had meaning and memories for us all. No agenda, no set list, no tickets to sell ... This was all we have ever done, and all we could do. So we did it."" When you are young you never think that Alzheimer's will enter your own life. But unless something is done to defeat the disease, years from now people who are today young and strong will be fighting it, and -- when the disease strikes their favorite actors, athletes and singers who are in 2012 so full of youth and energy, and who will inevitably grow old -- they, too, will be reminded of the passing years, and of life's memories lost and found. Bobby Vee was at one time the kid wonder of kid wonders. He was only 15 when, the night after Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper died in that 1959 Iowa charter-plane crash, he was recruited to somehow help make the show go on at the tour's next stop in Moorhead, Minnesota. He and his friends from nearby Fargo filled in that night, and his career began. He and his band were much admired in that Minnesota/North Dakota area. A young piano player, wanting to make music with Bobby Vee, showed up and asked to play in some shows. He said his name was Elston Gunn, which it wasn't. Later he would choose another name: Bob Dylan. In Dylan's autobiography, he writes with great regard, warmth and true professional respect for Vee, starting with the days when they were both little more than kids (""Bobby Vee and me had a lot in common, even though our paths would take such different directions ... Bobby had a metallic, edgy tone to his voice and it was as musical as a silver bell.""). These are especially tense hours for the Vee family. He wrote in that letter about his Alzheimer's diagnosis: ""My beautiful wife of 48 years, Karen, is also dealing with serious health issues as we await a lung transplant for her at Duke University."" Last week, Bobby's son Jeff told me that the operation had been performed the night before, and that the family is praying for the best outcome. As Bobby neared the end of the letter to his friends and fans, he wrote: . ""We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for every musical moment we've shared. It has truly been a magical odyssey. We have been blessed ... and the road goes on."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene says 60's pop star Bobby Vee is suffering from Alzheimer's .

"(CNN) -- Memorial Day weekend has, over the years, turned in large part into something it was not originally intended to be: . Seventy-two hours of barbecues and ballgames, of swimming-pool openings, of high-decibel sales pitches by merchandisers hoping to cash in on the unofficial start of summer. Which, to a degree, is understandable. The weather is turning warm, there's a holiday feel to the break from work, and the solemnity and grieving for those who gave their lives in the pursuit of peace seems to sometimes get pushed aside. But it is that pursuit of peace, with all its contradictions and all its sacrifices, that remains the centerpiece of Memorial Day. And this weekend it might be worth pausing, if only for a moment, to reflect upon a quotation that has variously been attributed to Winston Churchill and to George Orwell: . ""We sleep soundly in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm."" Through history, peace in the world has often, of necessity, been attained by the most brutal means available during military conflict. There is a dichotomy intrinsic to wars waged in pursuit of peace -- an uneasy divide between lightness and shadows. Tranquility born of bloodshed; happiness the end result of horror. We don't like to think too much about that, and no wonder. The truth behind it goes against our better nature. What is the most beloved image celebrating the joyous end of World War II? It's the Alfred Eisenstaedt photo of the sailor and the nurse embracing in Times Square. Even now, more than 60 years later, that photo makes people weep with glad emotion, makes them grin with across-the-generations exultation. That photo, it is often declared, says it all. But there would be no photo of the sailor and the nurse were it not for scenes no one likes to see in photographs: the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that brought the awful years of war to a close. It is perfectly explicable that we much prefer bathing ourselves in exuberant images of the first hours of peace, rather than the gruesome images of the last hours of war. One person who was in fact present during those last hours of World War II was Paul Tibbets. During the many days and evenings I spent with him during the final years of his life, there were occasions when the conversation would turn to that photo of the sailor and the nurse. Sometimes, when we were traveling together and he would be attending a military reunion, someone would approach him with a copy of the photo. Paul would never say anything. He'd look over at me and merely raise his eyebrows, almost imperceptibly. He wasn't the photographer, but Eisenstaedt would have had nothing to photograph were it not for him. He was the man -- the military aviator -- assigned by the United States government to put together, in utter secrecy, the unit that would carry out the atomic raids on Japan. When the day came, he didn't delegate; he flew the B-29 named Enola Gay -- his mother's name -- to Hiroshima with one goal in mind: to make the war stop. To let the soldiers, sailors, aviators and Marines go home at last, to rejoin their families or start new families, to somehow, after all the suffering and all the heartbreak, find peace. Of course the sailor and the nurse are the preferred visual representation of victory. What Paul Tibbets, navigator Dutch Van Kirk, bombardier Tom Ferebee and their crew were asked to do over the skies of Japan is something that is difficult for many people to think about; it's much more pleasant to smile at the sight of the kiss in New York. Peace is the sun-dappled result, but getting there can be a path of darkness upon darkness. Which is why, on Memorial Day weekend, it is probably reasonable that some people reflexively turn away from thoughts of battlefields and death. The people who turn away are generally not the ones whose family members have in wartime trod that dark and lonely path. On the occasions through the centuries when long wars have come to an end, many newspapers have chosen to go with the most glorious single-word, all-capital-letters headline of all: . PEACE! Is there a word in the English language that is more welcome, more highly cherished? That is more likely to be greeted with exhilaration and prayerful relief by all who see it? Nearly every desire a person, or a nation, can have is embodied in that single syllable. All the lightness and all the shadows, all the wars waged at terrible costs, all in pursuit of peace. To get to such a state of harmony has never been a peaceful journey. Which is why the word is so beautiful, so yearned for: . Because it sounds so simple while remaining so rare. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Memorial Day a holiday for barbecues, fun; but better to reflect on peace .

"(CNN) -- During the Olympic Games in London, which will end with Sunday's closing ceremony, there have been many memorable moments: . The triumph of Michael Phelps. The dazzling talent of Gabby Douglas. The countless displays of lustrous skills honed by the world's finest young athletes over years of arduous practice. But one of the most lasting memories may be the one provided by an 86-year-old woman who was not exactly an obscure footnote to history when the Games began. Queen Elizabeth II, in her now-famous James Bond scene, was a highlight, if not the highlight, of the opening ceremony. Her deadpan grace was something that many an accomplished actor would envy. With four words, delivered to an enormous global audience, she, with an implied smiling wink, humanized herself and embodied winning warmth. The filmed scene will always be a hallmark of the 2012 Olympics (the stunt double jumping out of the helicopter -- who would have imagined that she would have approved it?). These vastly entertaining television Olympics really began with those four words from her: . ""Good evening, Mr. Bond."" As the queen turned from her writing desk to greet James Bond, played by the current Bond actor Daniel Craig, her calm tone of voice reminded me of the lovely scene in the movie ""The Queen,"" in which Helen Mirren, playing Queen Elizabeth, says to Michael Sheen, the actor playing Tony Blair: . ""Yes, well, you are my 10th prime minister, Mr. Blair. My first, of course, was Winston Churchill."" London 2012 legacy: Trust the British to get it right . In greeting Daniel Craig in the Olympics scene, the real queen, in that utterly polite but manifestly unimpressed voice, could just as well have been saying: . ""Yes, well, you are my seventh James Bond, Mr. Craig. My first, of course, was Sean Connery."" (For those of you who are already thinking that there have been only six feature-film Bonds -- Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Craig -- you are leaving out David Niven, who played Bond in a less-than-officially-authorized ""Casino Royale"" in 1967. And there have been other Bonds in various radio and television productions.) Queen Elizabeth has been around for them all. In fact, she was already wearing the crown when, in 1953, Ian Fleming published his first Bond novel, ""Casino Royale."" The films that were inspired by Fleming's books have been a strong, hugely popular and endlessly lucrative franchise, but there is a case to be made that the novels are even better. Just reading the opening words of ""Casino Royale"" is a lesson in beautiful scene-setting, the flawless introduction of a brand-new character: . ""The scent and smoke and sweat of a casino are nauseating at three in the morning. Then the soul-erosion produced by high gambling -- a compost of greed and fear and nervous tension -- becomes unbearable and the senses awake and revolt from it. ""James Bond suddenly knew that he was tired. He always knew when his body or his mind had had enough and he always acted on that knowledge. This helped him to avoid staleness and the sensual bluntness that breeds mistakes. ..."" Opinion: London Olympics have redefined how Britain sees itself . The novels still read thrillingly today (here's a tip: the best of them is ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service""), but there is no question that when the movies came along, they overshadowed Fleming's ink-on-paper volumes. This Diamond Jubilee year commemorating Queen Elizabeth's 60-year reign is also the 50th anniversary of the Bond films, starting with ""Dr. No,"" and the series is receiving renewed attention. In the 1980s I spent a day with Connery -- he was filming ""The Untouchables"" with Robert De Niro and Kevin Costner -- as he left the set to go to several appointments with doctors. It turned out that for all his daring exploits in the Bond movies, he was deathly afraid of needles (as a child he had seen from eye-level and inches away a girl from his class in Scotland getting inoculated during a diphtheria outbreak, and ""the fear of needles has been with me ever since."") Of Fleming's Bond novels, Connery said: ""To tell you the truth, I never read them all."" Of the ones he did read, he said, ""I was never all that crazy about the books."" But the author himself? ""I liked Fleming,"" Connery said. ""He was erudite -- and a real snob. Being a genuine snob can be quite healthy. At least you know who you're dealing with. ""We got along rather well, surprisingly. We had both been in the Royal Navy -- although he was a commander and I was an able-bodied seaman."" By the time Daniel Craig was born in 1968, Connery had already starred in five Bond films. Connery told me that he approved of the idea of new generations of actors playing Bond as the years went by -- ""The guy should be young. Or at least under 50"" -- and so it was Craig, as the contemporary Bond, who co-starred with the queen in the Olympics film. To look at Craig's face after the queen turns and sees him -- ""Good evening, Mr. Bond"" -- is to see Craig the man, not just Craig the actor. He knows just how indelible a moment this is in his own life. He's doing a scene with Queen Elizabeth -- and she is the reveal, not him. In the Bond movies, it's the Bond character who, sometimes literally, always symbolically, makes the turn, and reveals to the audience who he is: ""Bond. James Bond."" But in the Olympics film, the queen, as Craig clearly and delightedly understands, is the actor the audience's eyes are fastened upon. Not bad, at 86. And, as enduring Olympic moments go, gold. Pure gold. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: One of the most memorable Olympic moments wasn't in a sporting event .

"(CNN) -- Quick quiz: . Name every big-league baseball team. No fair looking it up online, or checking a newspaper sports page. Just name them all. Take your time. We'll wait. (Pause) Are you back? If you could do it, congratulations -- you may belong in the Hall of Fame. I've followed baseball since I was a kid, and I couldn't come up with all the teams when I tried just now. I don't feel so bad about it, because I asked two baseball fanatics -- guys who really know the game -- if they could rattle off all the teams, and they had their doubts. ""I probably couldn't do it,"" said Rob Fleder, formerly executive editor of both Sports Illustrated and The National Sports Daily, and editor of ""Damn Yankees,"" an anthology of original essays about the New York Yankees by celebrated writers, to be published next month. ""I'm supposed to know this, but I'd probably miss one or two."" Fleder said that if you were to go up to people on the street and ask them to name all the Major League teams, ""I'd guess that only 5% or 10% could do it -- most likely closer to 5%."" Author David Krell, who is at work on ""Blue Magic: The Brooklyn Dodgers, Ebbets Field, and the Battle for Baseball's Soul,"" agreed with Fleder: ""Less than 10% of people would be able to do it. Maybe a lot less. I know that I'd end up leaving some teams out."" The reason for this little exercise is that Major League Baseball has just announced that its playoffs will be expanded by two teams, so that 10 teams will now go into post-season play. There are currently 30 big-league teams: 16 in the National League and 14 in the American League. It's that 30-team number that makes verbally zipping through a list of them so daunting. You just blank out. (When, after Krell and Fleder had predicted that they'd be unable to name all the teams I asked them to attempt it, Krell maxed out at 29 teams and Fleder hit 26 before, 18 minutes into trying, he said he'd toss in the towel. I made it to 29, but I allowed myself longer than 18 minutes. Maybe you did better. If so, Krell, Fleder and I salute you.) From the first years of the 20th century straight through to the early 1960s, baseball had perfect symmetry: eight teams in the National League, eight teams in the American. Any kid and most adults could quickly list them. It was easy to determine if the town where you lived was big-league: If there was one of those 16 teams in town, then it was. If not, then it wasn't. There was only one playoff series: the World Series. Under baseball's new system, the equivalent of the entire old National League and 25% of the old American League would make it to the playoffs. All of this is very good for the baseball business and the television sports business. But just as when any professional sports league expands there are worries about a dilution of the talent pool, so, too, when the playoffs keep expanding, there is a danger of the dilution of memories. When you try to spread big moments out too thin, they don't seem quite as big anymore. And, as Krell pointed out, for all the benefits and basic fairness that came with free agency, ""when players switch teams so much, it's tough for the fans to get a chance to root for a solid group of players for six or eight straight years."" The memories keep heading out of town. How visceral and enduring is the meaning of all this? I still treasure as one of the most dizzyingly wondrous days of my life a single summer afternoon in 1983 when I got to spend time talking with Joe DiMaggio, Duke Snider, Pee Wee Reese, Willie Mays, Roger Maris, Ernie Banks, Bobby Thomson and Stan Musial. The occasion was the 50th anniversary of the All-Star Game; a special old-timers' game had been arranged. I was working for ABC's ""Nightline"" in those Ted Koppel years, and I was assigned to do the story. It was like a parade of Topps baseball cards come to life -- the good cards, the prized ones, the cards you hoped against hope would be included in the wax-paper pack you bought at the drugstore, along with that brittle, pink, always slightly stale slab of gum. (My favorite moment of the afternoon? Easy -- Snider telling me he had gone to a car wash, and, surprised at how inexpensive it was, asking the attendant if the price wasn't usually higher: ""And the fellow said, 'Yes, sir, but we give a discount to senior citizens.' "" Second favorite moment? The organist at Chicago's old Comiskey Park playing ""When I'm 64"" as I was talking on the field with Reese, and Reese saying: ""Do they have one called 'When I'm 65'?"" He was about to have a birthday.) Baseball clearly did the right thing fiscally by growing past the original eight-team leagues and establishing outposts in far-flung parts of the country. Per-team home attendance is much higher now than it was in, say, the early 1950s. And adding two more teams to the playoffs will make the cash registers ring. Yet there was something kind of swell about the years when, of course, you could rapidly name every team -- when you knew them as well as you knew the names of the streets in your own neighborhood. But, as Fleder told me, the act of remembering has itself become largely unnecessary: ""We don't have to remember things, so we don't. The answer to any question is: 'Give me five seconds on the Internet.' "" So if you couldn't name those 30 teams, it may not matter. Sincere good luck to baseball with its expanded playoffs. And Reggie Jackson probably doesn't have to worry that some post-season hero will someday supplant him as Mr. October. At this rate, the new guy will be Mr. November. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Major League Baseball is expanding the number of playoff teams to 10 .

"(CNN) -- For well over a century the world has come to call on Garden City, Kansas, every day of the year. ""I know the town would miss it,"" said Garden City's mayor, David Crase. ""I hope it doesn't come to that."" He was talking about the Southwest Chief, the big Amtrak passenger train that runs daily between Chicago and Los Angeles. Garden City, with a population of around 28,000, has had its own daily passenger railroad service since the town was founded in rural southwest Kansas in the late 1800s. The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe sent its glamorous trains through Kansas on their way east and west. Garden City built its train station right downtown. To have the station there made the town part of the grand and glorious thread that, railroad-stop-by-railroad-stop, connected the still-young nation, the thread that made the country seem, and feel, cohesive and whole. When Amtrak took over the passenger railroads in the early 1970s, many cities around the country -- some much larger than Garden City -- lost train service, and the need for their stations. But Garden City never did. Twice each day, Sundays and holidays included, the Southwest Chief pulls to a full stop downtown to let passengers get off and let passengers get on. Residents who live nearby can literally stroll over to the train station, hop on the Southwest Chief, and step off at the end of the line in Los Angeles. But even for residents who never use the Southwest Chief, its presence is a symbol. The whistle sounds, as it has since the 1800s, and it signals that men and women from large cities and small will be stopping, however briefly, in their town, at their station. ""You take pride in that sort of thing,"" said John Doll, a member of the city commission. ""Just knowing it's there. When you see that train roll in, it's like listening to an old song that you love. ""When I was a boy, my father, my two brothers and I would ride the train to Kansas City every summer to see a ballgame. They were the Kansas City Athletics then; they weren't yet the Royals. We'd stay at the Muehlebach Hotel. Every time I see or hear that train, that's what I think about: my dad and my brothers and riding through Kansas on our way to see big-league baseball."" Nothing is forever, though, and the possibility that the Southwest Chief may, within a few years, no longer come through Garden City is one of those stories built on dry, arcane economic facts. The great majority of tracks that Amtrak rolls over are not owned by Amtrak, but are used through financial arrangements with the freight railroads. The tracks that run through Garden City's portion of Kansas and parts of Colorado and New Mexico are owned by BNSF Railway. All across the United States, between the renowned metropolises, are smaller towns that generations ago were selected to have their own stations -- stopping-off points-- and thus were accorded a special kind of enduring identity. This spring, the Garden City Telegram reported, Amtrak and BNSF held a meeting in Garden City with representatives of the communities the Southwest Chief serves in those three states -- towns including Dodge City, Kansas; La Junta, Colorado; Raton, New Mexico. The Telegram reported that, because of the cost of maintaining the old tracks, the Southwest Chief may, within the next several years, be switched to an entirely different BNSF route, farther south. The sums involved are not paltry. According to the Telegram, if the Southwest Chief is to stay on its traditional route with its traditional stations, $10 million per year for track-maintenance costs and a total of $100 million for long-term improvements must be found. If not, the alternate, passenger-train-ready BNSF tracks many miles to the south beckon. It might not make much difference to the long-haul passengers who are riding between Chicago and California and don't much care where the train stops along the way. And it certainly won't make any difference to all the travelers who fly in jet airplanes across the country and seldom look down. But there is something about a small town that has never gone a single day, in almost 150 years, without a passenger train pulling in and pausing to see if anyone would like to step out onto the streets of Garden City, or if anyone from Garden City would like to climb aboard and join the other cross-continental travelers... ""You get on the Southwest Chief downtown,"" John Doll said, ""and within five minutes Garden City is all behind you. You're gone, just that quickly."" When the interstate highway system was built, it managed to leave Garden City out, he said; it is an 80-mile drive on two-lane state roads to the nearest entrance to I-70. ""It would be a setback if we were to lose the passenger train,"" said Matt Allen, the city manager. ""We like to think we are the center of activities in western Kansas, and having the daily train service is an important part of that."" And, of course, there is the romance of the rails, a romance that has somehow been able to survive all of Amtrak's struggles -- even in an era that proclaims a digital, virtual world can transport a person anywhere without that person ever leaving home. When you're boarding a long-distance train, you are not boarding a number. You are boarding a name that sounds like an orchestral overture: the City of New Orleans; the Empire Builder; the Lake Shore Limited. Or the Southwest Chief, bound for Garden City and points beyond. After the 1959 murders of four members of the Clutter family in a farmhouse in nearby Holcomb, author Truman Capote would arrive by train at the Garden City station to do the reporting that would result in the book ""In Cold Blood."" The young county prosecutor in the case, Duane West, who would help to send killers Dick Hickock and Perry Smith to execution by hanging, is 80 now, and still lives in Garden City. He said that he and his wife, Orvileta, have gone down to meet the Southwest Chief twice in the past few weeks. ""We had friends visit from New Zealand,"" he said. ""We went to the station to greet them, and we went to the station to see them off."" Efforts are under way to find financing to maintain the old tracks so the Southwest Chief will keep arriving in Garden City every day, as it always has. And, with the clock ticking, if its time in town should end? If, before the end of this decade, the train is moved to a distant set of tracks? The world will continue to spin. The Telegram reported that in 2011, the station in downtown Garden City served 7,511 passengers. A nice number, but not one that is likely to halt cold-eyed economic decisions. Yet the importance of something like this to a place cannot be brushed aside.

"(CNN) -- Remember those carefree days when a gallon of gas was only $5? And when you could cheerfully mail a letter for the rock-bottom price of 50 cents? Just saying those words out loud here to see what they sound like -- just trying to imagine what it will be like, 50 or 60 years from now, when Americans who are young today look back over their lives and recall fondly the second decade of the 21st century, when prices were low and reasonable. When you could actually buy a gallon of gas for five bucks, or a postage stamp for half a buck. Back before prices started to soar. Will it actually happen? Will the once-unheard-of prices we appear headed toward seem someday like great bargains, to be remembered warmly by Americans accustomed to paying $20 a gallon for gas, and $6 to mail a first-class letter? It seems at the same time impossible and inevitable. If, as some experts are predicting, gas hits the unprecedented $5 mark this summer, it may have an impact on the presidential campaign. CNN's Jack Cafferty, speaking on ""The Situation Room,"" said that regardless of the reasons for skyrocketing gas prices -- tension in the Middle East, the closing of refineries, increased demand for gas during summer vacation season -- ""Whether it's fair or not, the American motoring public has always tended to blame the guy in the White House for high gas prices."" Yet, political impact in an election year aside, we seem to be about to cross some invisible symbolic line with the possibility of $5-a-gallon gas and 50-cent first-class stamps, which the U.S. Postal Service is recommending. It's the definition of sticker shock, and the question is, will people accept the double whammy as something that just had to happen, or will they feel: . Too much is at last too much. We've lost our patience. Economists can make all the arguments they want about adjustments for inflation, but when you recall what gas once sold for, the nostalgia is not so much for a specific price point but for the freedom that came with going out for a long, casual drive without worrying it would break the bank. The ""See the U.S.A. in Your Chevrolet"" song was not directed at a nation nervous about the expense of filling up the tank. In 1950, a gallon of gas cost approximately 27 cents; by 1970 it had only gone up to approximately 35 cents. The highways were just waiting; as Dan Seals sang in his wonderful, if underappreciated, ode to the joys of driving, ""My Old Yellow Car"": . ""There was no road too winding and nowhere too far/With two bucks of gas and my old yellow car."" You remember your time on Earth by the mileposts along the way -- somewhere in the back of your mind, you know the price of gas the first time you ever bought a gallon, and the price of a postage stamp the first time you were aware they existed. From 1932 until 1958, the price of a first-class stamp didn't budge. For those 26 years, it was stuck at 3 cents. When it finally went up to 4 cents in '58, it was major news. When and if a stamp hits 50 cents, no one is really going to have to ask why. There are fixed costs to operating the Postal Service, many of them tied to labor, and the funds to support those costs are rapidly drying up in the age of e-mail. In the most recent fiscal quarter, the Postal Service lost $3.3 billion. In that same quarter, the volume of mail sent was down 6 percent from the previous year. Over the holidays, the Greeting Card Association reported, 1.5 billion holiday cards, the kind people mail to each other, were sold -- down from 2.7 billion as recently as 1995. But knowing the reasons the Postal Service needs more money does not erase the fact that the 50-cent stamp, like the $5 gallon of gas, takes us to a place we seldom considered we'd be. And it doesn't feel like this is the finish line. People get used to anything -- take a look at the price of a cocktail in a big-city restaurant, or a ticket to a major-league baseball game. Outlandish turns into commonplace. Yet some things -- gas, stamps -- don't qualify as optional, discretionary purchases; people need them when they need them, which is where the frustration comes in. The one-two punch of $5 gas and 50-cent stamps has such powerful symbolism precisely because those two products matter so much to so many people. And if the day should ever come when Americans look back on the five-buck gallon and the half-buck postage stamp with the same wistful longing that older Americans today feel for the 31-cent gallon and the 3-cent stamp... Well, that doesn't seem possible. But, then, neither did this. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","In 1950, a gallon of gas was about 27 cents; until 1958, a first-class stamp was 3 cents .
Some experts are predicting that gas price will hit the unprecedented $5 mark soon .

"(CNN) -- ""Every day and every night I want to see you and be with you. Yet I have no feeling of selfish ownership or jealousy. ""In fact I should always want you to live just as you wanted -- because if you didn't you would change and wouldn't be you. Let's go for a long ride Sundays; let's go to the mountains weekends; let's read books in front of fires; most of all, let's really grow together and find the happiness we know is ours."" The dewy-eyed romantic writing those words? Richard Nixon. On Friday the first in a series of handwritten love letters between a young Richard Nixon and a young Pat Ryan went on display at the Nixon Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California. The letters began in 1938 -- when they met while auditioning for a community play -- and extended almost up until their wedding day two years later. Former President Nixon died in 1994, the year after Pat Nixon's death. She would have been 100 this month. The exhibit at the Nixon Library featuring the love letters will almost certainly reignite the debate about the most controversial and enigmatic U.S. political figure of the last hundred years. Who -- not only in the end, but at the beginning -- was Nixon? For all his fame, did anyone truly know him? Most American adults long ago made up their minds about what they think of Nixon, pro or con. But, with the new focus this month on the Nixon Library and Museum, I hope that at least some of you will someday make the trip to Yorba Linda, will leave your political passions at the door for a bit, and will take in something that is absolutely haunting in its quiet power. I have done reporting and research at four presidential libraries, and the part of the Nixon Library I'd like to recommend to you is by far the most memorable aspect of any of them. Maybe because it is so unexpected. It's not inside the library itself; it's on a side lawn . It is a small house. The house where Nixon was born. It is not a replica. It has not been reconstructed or moved from somewhere else. It is the house where Nixon lived for the first nine years of his life. The Nixon Library and Museum was built on the site of the former lemon grove where his father, Frank, tried and failed to make a decent living. Frank Nixon built the house by hand, from a kit. The wood, nails and fittings, ordered from a catalog, arrived at the train station and Richard Nixon's dad, before the boy was born, put it together. It is so cramped and claustrophobic. That's what strikes you when you enter the front door. You can't just wander through by yourself; volunteer docents at the library accompany you. Six people lived in the house: Mr. and Mrs. Nixon, Richard and three of his brothers. Two of them would die from illnesses contracted in childhood; a fifth boy would be born after the Nixons moved away from Yorba Linda. You stand in that structure -- you look at the bedroom, to the left of the front door, and at the bed upon which Hannah Nixon in 1913 gave birth to the child who would end up a president -- and you think of the long and tumultuous life that Nixon would go on, from here, to lead. Most of all -- and this is the inescapable thought as you stand within those four close walls -- you ponder a United States before there was commercial airline travel, before there was television, and you picture the White House, a continent and a universe away. It would seem: You can't get there from here. And yet. ... The nature of raw ambition, and the rejection of impossibility, and the need to escape from what is to find out what will be. You stand in that nailed-together-from-a-kit house, and you try to imagine being a boy living there who has not yet learned what it is like to have strangers love you and strangers hate you, or even to have strangers know who you are. In the history of the United States, of all the hundreds of millions of people who have lived and died, fewer than 50 have become president. Where does it start? ""The living room was the center of our life in this house,"" Nixon once wrote. ""Before the days of television and radio, reading and conversation were our major indoor recreation. My first taste of politics came at the dinner table, which was in a corner of the living room. At dinner my father would engage us boys in lively conversations about the events of the day. I owe my early interests in debating to those dinners. Even though I was young, my father believed that no one was too young to have an opinion and to learn how to express himself."" The family's upright piano is in that living room -- Nixon learned to play not only that, but the violin, the clarinet, the saxophone and the accordion. Near the tiny kitchen with its cast-iron stove is a narrow flight of stairs. The house was not large enough to have a second story; instead it had kind of a half-attic where all four boys, including the two who would die, Arthur and Harold, slept in a single room. We're all thinking about the presidency this year, as the country moves toward another Election Day. Whatever your notions of Nixon, however much you may feel that everything that can be said about him has been said, I think you will be fascinated and perhaps moved by your time in that mail-order house, should you ever have the opportunity to go. Just to think, in the silence, about how things turn out the way they do. The American story can occasionally be utterly life-sized. From this spot to the White House, to China, to Moscow, to more than 56 countries, through all the political storms that still, even in death, rage around him. He and Mrs. Nixon are buried behind the house. A journey through life, a journey like no other, and in the end this is where they rest. You can't get there from here. But, of course, you can. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene says Richard Nixon's love letters to wife Pat on display at Nixon library .

"(CNN) -- May we spend a few minutes discussing a major part of American life where there has been a shocking lack of diversity? This has to do with presidential elections. And it's not what you think. Throughout U.S. history, Ivy League colleges have had an outsized proportion of alumni who became president. Harvard alone has eight. If, as is widely expected, it's Barack Obama versus Mitt Romney in November, the Ivy League is the guaranteed winner again, because it will be Harvard against Harvard. (Harvard's Romney has even, in speeches, criticized Harvard's Obama for spending too much time ""at the faculty lounge at Harvard."") In fact, it has been 28 years since a non-Harvard-or-Yale graduate has been elected president. George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama all went to one (or both) of those universities. In four of those elections, the winning Ivy Leaguer ran against another Ivy Leaguer (Michael Dukakis, incumbent President George H.W. Bush, Al Gore, John Kerry). But that's not the oddity we're discussing today. We all know, and have known for a long time, that in presidential elections, as in much of American life, the Ivy League has a leg up. And many of our presidents, to their credit, have come from small, non-glitzy colleges. Lyndon Johnson hailed from Southwest Texas State Teachers College. Richard Nixon went to Whittier College. Ronald Reagan went to Eureka College. Nine presidents either never went to college at all, or never received a degree. They were no slouches; they include Abraham Lincoln and Harry Truman. Here, though, is the strange, almost inexplicable, thing -- and it stands out for those of us who attended, and really liked, Big Ten schools: . No graduate of a Big Ten university has ever been elected president. Isn't that something? Heart of the country, large student populations, fine faculties, national renown -- yet in the history of the United States, the voters have not even once seen fit to send a Big Ten graduate to the White House. It's not that talent, leadership and creativity are lacking in  Big Ten students. Every member of the Big Ten (there are 12 schools in the conference now, since the addition of Penn State and Nebraska) has had numerous graduates -- undergraduate and advanced-degree -- who have done remarkable things. Neil Armstrong, of Purdue, was the first  human to set foot on the moon. Jack Welch, of the University of Illinois, led General Electric during glorious years. George Gallup, of the University of Iowa, founded the legendary public opinion poll. Cynthia Ozick, of Ohio State, is a widely acclaimed author. Barbara Franklin, of Penn State, went on to become a U.S. secretary of commerce. James Earl Jones, of the University of Michigan, became an esteemed actor. Arthur Goldberg, of Northwestern, was a justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Mildred Jeffrey, of the University of  Minnesota, was a women's movement, labor and civil rights leader who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. William S. Harley, of the University of Wisconsin, was the co-founder of Harley-Davidson. Alfred D. Hershey, of Michigan State, was a Nobel Laureate for physiology/medicine. Ernie Pyle, of Indiana University, left for a reporting job just before graduating, and went on to become perhaps the most admired newspaperman who ever lived; the university brought him back to present him with an honorary degree. And Johnny Carson, of the University of  Nebraska ... well, he was Johnny Carson. Which just may have been better than being president. The list of Big Ten achievers goes on and on. Yet voters have sent no one from a Big Ten school to the White House. (If you're thinking, what about Gerald Ford, the president from the University of Michigan? Yes, he became president, but the voters never elected him on a presidential ticket, a fact that bothered him for the rest of his life. When he did run on his own, he was defeated by Jimmy Carter, of Georgia Southwestern College, Georgia Tech and the U.S. Naval Academy). You would think that being from the Big Ten would provide a campaign plus. Heartland, breadbasket, center of the nation, the warm symbolism of all that. Ivy League graduates may take pride in their education, but they tend not to stress their Ivy Leagueness to voters in a presidential campaign: Like being rich, being from the Ivy League is something that may be privately savored, but that, in national elections, is best not flaunted in front of those without the same advantages. Being from the Big Ten, on the other hand, would seem to be a ticket to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. But it hasn't. Julian E. Zelizer, professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University (alma mater of Presidents James Madison and Woodrow Wilson), said that he, too, is puzzled by this. One reason for it, he said, may be that at universities that have a tradition of educating future presidents, ""students often become part of networks of classmates who go on to do big things in Washington. These networks are essential when potential candidates are identified to run for president."" Still, said Zelizer, whose work regularly appears in the CNN Opinion section, ""It is unclear why someone from the Big Ten would not be president, given the great quality of these institutions and impressive record, including in politics, of many of these graduates."" So what could it be? Is it simply a jinx? You might be tempted to say that the Big Ten is the Chicago Cubs of presidential politics -- except, even though it has been more than a century, the Cubs did win a World Series. You might be tempted to say that the Big Ten is the Susan Lucci of presidential politics -- except that the soap opera actress, after years of being passed over, finally was awarded an Emmy. The Big Ten has a Council of Presidents and Chancellors. I asked some of its members what they make of this. Not surprisingly -- speaking from the middle of the country -- they were optimistic and proud. France A. Cordova, president of Purdue University, said: ""If you knew our current students and could witness their abilities as young leaders, you would be as confident as I am that we will see a Boilermaker become the POTUS."" Ohio State president Gordon Gee expressed great contentment about his part of the nation: ""As to no president coming from the Big Ten, I would say that many have come from Big Ten country -- we just have sent them off elsewhere. That is ending, by the way."" ""We did offer, twice,"" said University of Minnesota president Eric Kaler, pointing out that Minnesota graduates Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale were Democratic nominees for president. They were defeated by Nixon and Reagan. ""You never say never,"" Kaler said. ""Of course it could happen."" And Sally Mason, president of the University of Iowa, summed it all up with a sure-handed sense of sunny Big Ten perseverance: . ""In the words of Randy Travis and B.B. King, perhaps 'It's Just a Matter of Time.'"" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","For 28 years, America's president has been either a Harvard or Yale alumnus .

"(CNN) -- In a long line at an airport security checkpoint, the man in front of me wearily reached into his travel cases and began to unload his electronic gear into the gray plastic bin. He had his laptop computer, two cellphones, a Kindle reading device and some sort of digital music player, each with its own power cord. He probably didn't need to throw the cords and chargers into the bin with the other devices, but he did anyway. So, with all the devices and cords piled on top of each other, the bin moved along the conveyor belt. The TSA agent standing watch asked the business traveler to put some of the gear in separate bins. He complied. I said to him: . ""Did you ever see 'Goldfinger'?"" ""The old James Bond movie?"" he said. ""Sure."" ""You know that scene where Q, the equipment master, outfits Bond for his upcoming secret agent assignment?"" ""Yes,"" the guy said. ""Why?"" ""Who do you think carried more electronic equipment?"" I said. ""You, or Bond?"" He laughed, and then set off to retrieve his digital arsenal. I thought about him last week, when millions of Gmail users found out that, without notice, they were temporarily cut off from Google's e-mail service. Perhaps you were one of them -- one of the millions who, for part of last Tuesday (the outage was said to be for more than an hour), were unable to send or receive letters on your Gmail account. And if you were among them, did you find yourself becoming annoyed, irritated -- maybe, against your better judgment, a little panicked -- or was there a part of you that felt oddly, secretly relieved? Did it feel like a snow day -- like getting an unexpected vacation from constant digital dutifulness? Google at first said the glitch affected ""less than 2 percent"" of the users of the service; later the company revised that estimate: ""We've determined that this issue affected less than 10% of the Google Mail users who attempted to access their accounts during the affected timeframe."" Ten percent would seem to be a relatively small portion of users. But it has been reported that Gmail -- which is provided at no cost to those who use it -- is utilized by some 350 million people worldwide. So if 10 percent of them could not send or receive e-mails, that, potentially, could be as many as 35 million people. It's at times like these that we can stop and think about how accustomed we have become to assuming we can always be reached on every one of the multiple digital pathways we choose to use. That assumption has become, if not exactly a birthright, an acquired right. And when we are reminded that we really don't know very much at all about how all of this works, and that we can be cut off from it for reasons just as enigmatic and unexplained as are the electronic mysteries that bring it to us in the first place.... Well, once the Gmail service was up and running again last week, this is what the cartoonist Brian McFadden sent out in a Twitter message to his friends and followers: . ""In hindsight, gnawing off my foot while Gmail was down might've been an overreaction."" What I often think about when stories like the Gmail outage or cellphone disruptions pop briefly into the news is the World War II guys who, for four years and more, never once heard the voices of the people they loved: their wives, their parents, their children. Four years away from their homes in the United States with only the most sporadic of overseas mail delivery, no phone calls at all, having to accept on faith that the people who meant the most to them were doing all right. Yet somehow, in the long silence, they made it. Most of them. There's no reason at all to mourn for the pre-digital days; they were isolating and could be awfully lonely, and the long silence is never coming back. But today, whenever there is an unanticipated short silence -- cell service goes temporarily dead, e-mail or text messaging or social networks cease to function because of an electronic burp somewhere -- it gives us the occasion to reflect upon how quickly we have gotten used to the new way, with our messages coming in and going out continually and seamlessly, day and night. Providing us the promise of never -- allegedly -- having to feel alone. Maybe, if you were one of the people who discovered that, however briefly, your Gmail could not come in or go out, you took the opportunity to discreetly celebrate a little bit. There was a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign posted on at least one door of your life, and no one could blame you for not being available. A little silence, digital or otherwise, can at times feel like a treat. Meanwhile, somewhere out there, the tired James Bond business traveler, and all his traveling brothers and sisters, are dumping their electronic sending-and-receiving stations into yet another security-line bin. Silence -- even when it's welcome -- is ultimately a fickle and fleeting illusion. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion .

"(CNN) -- If you're watching the first round of the National Basketball Association playoffs this weekend, take a good look at the players' jerseys. You'll see the standard features: names of the teams, numbers and names of the players. Make a mental picture of what you're looking at. Because there's a chance the old-style jerseys may become just a memory. As Richard Sandomir of the New York Times reported, NBA owners at a meeting in New York this month were presented with a display of six mannequin torsos. Three of the mannequins wore Chicago Bulls jerseys. Three wore Boston Celtics jerseys. But the jerseys had been intentionally altered, for the owners' consideration. They were festooned with advertising. The prominence of the on-jersey ads varied: One version did away with the team name and replaced it with the name of a corporate advertiser; a second version featured the advertiser's name beneath the player's number; a third put the advertiser's logo on a strap of the jersey. The NBA has not decided whether it will begin the move to jerseys bearing ads. None of the four major North American sports leagues -- the NBA, Major League Baseball, the National Football League and the National Hockey League -- permits advertising on team uniforms. But other professional sports -- auto racing, golf and soccer -- let athletes display ads on their clothing. And when Sandomir asked Adam Silver, deputy commissioner of the NBA, about the league's position on instituting jerseys with ads, Silver said: ""If we add sponsor logos to jerseys, we recognize that some of our fans will think we've lost our minds. But the NBA is a global business and logos on jerseys are well-established in other sports and commonplace outside the U.S."" If and when it happens -- if the NBA becomes the first major American sports league to turn uniforms into advertising billboards -- the surprising thing may turn out to be how quickly the public, after expressing initial consternation, decides that it's no big deal. Advertising once was seen as having the potential to be an unwelcome intrusion of hucksterism into places where hucksterism did not belong. But if there was a line that was not supposed to be crossed, that line was obliterated long ago. Not only is advertising ubiquitous and largely unquestioned today, it has managed to become a sought-after symbol of something's -- or someone's -- worth. If a national corporation -- a soft drink, a breakfast cereal, an energy bar -- pays to put its brand on the T-shirt for a charity race, or on a local school's football stadium, or in the program for a college reunion, there is a sense of officially making the big time. ""Selling out"" was for years a pejorative phrase, but it has lost much of its punch; national advertisers have worked so effectively to elevate the power of their brands, that there is status inherent in being connected with them and with their success. To paraphrase the old Dean Martin song: You're nobody till somebody buys you. And, increasingly, national companies don't even have to offer money to people to promote their brands -- people pay their own money to do just that for the companies. All the customers who eagerly hand over cash so they can wear the Nike swoosh become free ambassadors for the manufacturer. At least the hardy souls who wear sandwich boards on city sidewalks to promote stores and products are compensated for doing it. Objecting to this trend is futile. It has been building steadily for years. The Chicago Bulls won their first three NBA championships while playing in the classically named Chicago Stadium, but their second three championships were won while playing in the new United Center, sponsored by the airline, and it just seemed like the way of the world. People sometimes bemoan encroaching commercialism inside Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, but that ballpark was, in contemporary parlance, and early adopter of you-can't-escape-it advertising, having been named for the man who owned it, a chewing-gum manufacturer. If there was a stigma associated with advertising appearing in untraditional places, it is all but gone. Should the NBA decide to go forward with ads on jerseys, the players will probably put up a fight until they get their desired percentage of the income from the sponsors, but that will be negotiated. If the players resist, the owners will say: Do you want to keep making more money or not? In professional sports, there is only one thing considered more important than winning, and that is finding new revenue streams. The major sports leagues won't be the end of this. What are two parts of American life that urgently need an economic boost? The U.S. Postal Service and the financial system itself. So perhaps the day will come when top-shelf advertisers are invited to bid for the right to place their logos on postage stamps, and on currency. It would be an unbeatable way to pump cash into the postal service and into the U.S. Treasury. There would be certain complications: Burger King might not be thrilled if consumers bought its food with dollar bills emblazoned with the McDonald's arches. Ground rules would have to be worked out. James Dean, more than a half-century ago, made the plain white T-shirt the ultimate symbol of cool. That shirt, in marketing circles, would seem naked now; where's the logo? Dean would be seen as foolishly missing a golden opportunity. All that potential ad space on his shirt, wasted. Dean never played in the NBA, though. Enjoy the playoffs this year, and savor the sight of the unadorned jerseys. The startling thing is not that a major sport is considering plastering ads on those uniforms. The startling thing is that it has taken them this long. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: News report says NBA considers putting ads on players' jerseys .

"(CNN) -- Winston Churchill, glaring, resolute, combative, left hand on hip, stares straight off the page -- a moment, and an image, like no other. (How did the photographer, Yousuf Karsh, get that iconic pose from Churchill, Britain's prime minister, in 1941? Churchill told Karsh that he had very little time for the session. Karsh reached over and took Churchill's cigar from him -- then, as Churchill reacted, snapped the photo.) Marilyn Monroe, at her most beautiful in 1953, leans back, wearing white slacks and a black sweater, and gazes off dreamily to her right. Somehow, even though being photographed for a national magazine, she appears supremely relaxed and right at home. Why? She was at home -- she knew that the photographer, Alfred Eisenstaedt, and the magazine, Life, would do right by her, and she had invited them in. Prisoners at the Buchenwald concentration camp in 1945, their faces haunted, their bodies gaunt, their eyes showing nothing and everything, look out from behind the wire fence that imprisons them, just before they are liberated. How did Margaret Bourke-White happen to be there to shoot that photo? Gen. George Patton wanted the world to see why his soldiers were fighting. Patton understood that Bourke-White and her magazine -- Life -- were the best way for the world to witness and understand. All these photos and hundreds more are in a book called ""75 Years: The Very Best of Life."" It was published just before the holidays; I bought copies for friends around the country, and all of them have told me the same thing: They are spending hours with it, looking for long minutes at individual photos, treasuring the talent of the photographers, many long dead. View the recently launched CNN Photos blog . It is the photographers that I keep thinking about as I have spent my own hours and days with the book. To be a Life staff photographer meant that you were among the best in the world. Professional news photographers, even the most highly regarded of them, find themselves in tenuous times today; it is expensive to have them on staff and to send them places to do their work. There is always going to be someone with a camera around to snap a close-to-good-enough image and sell it inexpensively or give it away. So to linger over the photos in the Life 75th anniversary book -- it is a very large book, because Life's pages were large by design, for maximum impact -- is to marvel at the commitment the magazine made, especially in the days before television, to do whatever was necessary to bring the world to its readers. And to spend time with those images is to honor the talent and courage of the photographers whose best work is on the level of fine art -- fine art produced as the deadline clock is ticking. They were there. They seemed always to be there, at the moments that mattered. Larry Burrows in Vietnam in 1966 as Marine Sgt. Jeremiah Purdie, grievously wounded, reaches for a comrade who is also hurt; Ralph Morse virtually living with the first astronauts, capturing Alan Shepard, in 1961, running toward the Redstone rocket booster that will propel him toward space; Bill Eppridge at Robert Kennedy's side in that California hotel kitchen in 1968, somehow, in the anguished confusion, getting the shattering photograph of busboy Juan Romero who is down on the floor with Kennedy, trying to comfort the dying senator. . . . W. Eugene Smith in 1948 with Dr. Ernest Ceriani, the country doctor who was the subject of one of the most famous photo essays ever published, as Ceriani, on the edge of exhaustion, wearily holds a cup of coffee; Gordon Parks in Rio de Janeiro in 1961, paying tribute to the heartbreaking life of 12-year-old Flavio Da Silva, a boy who is malnourished and ill but who must care for his brothers and sisters; Eisenstaedt in Times Square on V-J Day in 1945, with the impossible task of trying to sum up in a single shot the nation's joy as the war ends, and doing so with that photo of photos: the sailor and the nurse. . . . Life featured words, too, of course, but it was the photographers who were the stars. During my own tenure as Life's columnist, my first assignment took me to rural Kentucky with the Everly Brothers, as the singers returned to their late father's home. I was glad to be in the company of Don and Phil Everly, but the real thrill came from the days spent on the road with the great Life photographer Harry Benson. I kept looking over at him. So this is Harry Benson. So this is how he works. I didn't want to miss or forget a moment of it. I should mention that Life and CNN reside under the same corporate roof. But I fell in love with Life long before there was such a thing as CNN; Life brought the world to my parents' Ohio home, and when the mailman delivered it each week, he was bringing us more than just a magazine. He was bringing us . . . Well, he was bringing us life. Life observed with as much skill and guts and heart as those photographers could push themselves to produce. Life, as a regularly scheduled magazine, is no more; it continues as a series of single-topic issues and special books, and its photography is featured on its popular website. But the Life that was read in America's homes each week, and then, later, each month, is gone. ""I can't stop looking at that book,"" Gary Griffin, one of the friends to whom I gave copies, told me on the phone from California the other night. Me, either. Jackie Robinson rounds third base in the 1955 World Series, the expression on his face the stuff of novels, and Ralph Morse freezes it in time and gives us the chills all these years later.

"(CNN) -- We are now able to project a winner in the 2012 presidential race: . Brooks & Dunn. Again. If that wasn't clear enough already, it became abundantly so at the end of Newt Gingrich's victory speech in South Carolina last weekend. As Gingrich left the stage, his campaign staff played a song through the speaker system. The song was ""Only in America,"" by the country duo Brooks & Dunn. Of course. That song has become a bipartisan standard in recent presidential campaigns. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney used it at their rallies; Barack Obama used it at his rallies; John McCain used it at his rallies; and now Gingrich is using it. Mitt Romney, too. Politicians have long utilized campaign songs, but it is unusual for Republicans and Democrats to share the same song. After Bill Clinton used Fleetwood Mac's ""Don't Stop (Thinking About Tomorrow)"" in his 1992 campaign, it would have been inconceivable for a Republican opponent to use it at GOP rallies that year, or for Republicans four years later to use it. It would have reminded potential voters of the other guy. But ""Only in America"" has managed to transcend party lines; its lyrics, about the U.S. ideal of opportunity for all, seem to speak to a deeply held national belief, even a yearning, and the insistent opening guitar chords rivet an audience. ""Only in America,"" Ronnie Dunn's voice sings, ""Dreaming in red, white and blue; Only in America, Where we dream as big as we want to. ..."" When Obama, late in the summer of 2008, finished his speech accepting his party's nomination for president in that packed Invesco Field football stadium in Denver, there was the Brooks & Dunn song booming out of the speakers, becoming the soundtrack of the historic moment. That four years earlier the song had been playing at Bush/Cheney events didn't seem to matter. ""We all get a chance, Everybody gets to dance. ..."" Brooks & Dunn, after a 20-year career of platinum albums and No. 1 hits, have broken up and no longer perform together. But last week I was able to get in touch with both Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn, and in separate conversations we talked about what having their song become the go-to anthem for presidential candidates means. ""The song was never intended to be partisan, and it isn't,"" said Dunn. He was in rehearsals for a solo tour in support of his new single, ""Let the Cowboy Rock,"" and even though the Brooks & Dunn duo is no more, he said he often thinks about the political life that song of theirs has taken on. ""It's about the opportunity, in America, to try to attain anything you want,"" he said. When, in 2008, the song began to be heard at rallies for both sides (neither candidate had asked for their permission), he and Brooks made the decision not to say anything publicly about their private political preferences: ""We kind of laid low. We did that on purpose."" Which made all kinds of sense. Some singers and bands, when their songs are played by candidates they don't favor, loudly demand that the candidate stop immediately. Dunn and his partner instinctively realized that if both parties had adopted ""Only in America,"" they should just sit back and let their work be constantly heard by citizens of every political persuasion. When good fortune unexpectedly comes raining down on you, the last thing you want to do is reach for an umbrella. ""I'm moved by the whole thing,"" Dunn said. ""Of all the voices in America, to have my voice be the one that sings those words . . . ."" Kix Brooks, who is completing his own solo album and also hosts the syndicated radio show ""American Country Countdown,"" told me, ""The song was never Republican or Democrat. I think that politicians of both parties get that."" Brooks wrote the song, in collaboration with Nashville songwriters Don Cook and Ronnie Rogers, as simply ""an appreciation of our freedoms in America."" When Brooks & Dunn were filling arenas and stadiums night after night, there would come a moment, midway through ""Only in America,"" when local members of the military invited by the band -- usually four or five of them, from the different branches, always in uniform -- would march in crisp formation onto the stage, and would face the audience, then salute. The audiences would stand and cheer, some people with tears flowing. It might be the one and only time in the lives of the young men and women from the Army, the Marines, the Navy and the Air Force when they would have a moment like this: when they would be onstage in front of tens of thousand of people, and be applauded with gratitude for the sacrifice they were making. ""After the song,"" Brooks said, ""the soldiers would leave the stage, and I would look at them, and they would just be glowing."" Campaign songs have always been a tradition with presidential candidates -- ""Marching with McKinley"" for William McKinley, ""He's All Right"" for Benjamin Harrison, ""Get On a Raft with Taft"" for William Howard Taft, ""Keep Cool and Keep Coolidge"" for Calvin Coolidge -- but only in recent years have songs that are already big hits, and that were not written for a candidate, been made a regular part of campaign playlists. With the Brooks & Dunn song, neither political party seems to want to be the one not to play it. It has, without any push from the men who sang it, managed to become a part of the presidential process. ""If the candidates want our song to come out of their speakers, it's fine with me,"" said Brooks, who was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, during Dwight D. Eisenhower's first term. ""I just feel lucky. I never got tired of singing it"" said Dunn, who was born in Coleman, Texas, also while Eisenhower was in the White House. Only in America. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.

"(CNN) -- As we head into a workweek that ends with a federal holiday on Friday, you can expect the usual: . Newspaper, television and Internet advertisements touting special sales and slashed prices on selected items. Veterans Day has become an annual opportunity for merchandisers -- many of them see the holiday as a chance to get a jump on Black Friday, the day-after-Thanksgiving bacchanalia of bust-down-the-doors sales pushes. It's hard to blame the merchants. The economy has been dismal. Anything that might bring shoppers into stores is seen as a plus. But before the Veterans Day promotions kick into high gear, perhaps we might take a moment for a different suggestion about how to commemorate the day: . Make a note to yourself. Make a promise to do what you can, whenever you can, to pay a visit to an unforgettable American place: . Arlington National Cemetery, just across the Potomac River from Washington. More than 300,000 souls have found their final resting places in that cemetery. Anyone who wishes to visit is always welcome. It is a short distance from the popular tourist attractions on the National Mall. If you are at the Lincoln Memorial and are in the mood for a walk, all you need do is circle behind the monument to Mr. Lincoln, cross the street and head for the Memorial Bridge that spans the Potomac, then take a stroll along the pedestrian lanes that are on either side of the bridge. You emerge in Virginia, where the broad, boulevard-like Memorial Drive leads to the entrance of Arlington. Once you are inside, all is still. The beauty of the place, and the knowledge of why it is there, can take your breath away. There are 624 acres of lawns, gardens and towering trees that are hundreds of years old, but as gorgeous as all of that is, they aren't what overwhelm you. The sight of those hundreds of thousands of headstones, each honoring a military veteran or a member of the military who died while serving, is what has the power to render you silent and humbled. Some parts of the cemetery draw large and constant crowds: the Tomb of the Unknowns, the eternal flame where John F. Kennedy is buried. But for me, the best way to spend time at Arlington is just to set off on a walk along the many paths that meander through less-visited portions of the grounds. You can walk for hours and never pass the same headstone twice. To stop and read the names on those headstones, and the dates, and to think about the service each of those departed soldiers, sailors, aviators and Marines gave to the nation where the rest of us now live and breathe ... to do that is to remind yourself of what duty entails. Each person who comes to Arlington takes his or her own memories home. There are moments that can be surprising to a first-time visitor. A distance from the always-well-attended grave of President Kennedy is another resting place that seldom has many people around it: that of William Howard Taft of Ohio, the only person in the nation's history to serve both as president of the United States (1909-1913) and chief justice of the United States Supreme Court (1921-1930). Sometimes you will find yourself the only visitor there. I always make a point of stopping at the grave of Audie Murphy, the most decorated combat soldier of World War II; his headstone is no different or more ornate than the other hundreds of thousands on the grounds, a soldier among soldiers. And, since 2003, there has been the grave of an old friend and wonderful, generous colleague: Bill Mauldin, the enlisted man whose cartoons in Stars and Stripes made him beloved to the soldiers with whom he served in the Second World War, and who went on, after the war, to become as fine a newspaper editorial cartoonist as ever lived. A visitor will feel especially moved when, across a patch of grass, he catches sight of one of the between 27 and 30 new burials that take place on an average day. Arlington remains a working cemetery; it is a place, in the words of the cemetery's own defining statement, ""where dignity and honor rest in solemn repose,"" and that touches you most deeply when you see the newly arrived family of a veteran standing with bowed heads at another fresh grave site. You may not get to Arlington on Veterans Day this week, but if you promise yourself to visit one day, you will never regret it. The cemetery is open to the public every day of the year. It opens promptly at 8 a.m. During these fall and winter months it closes at 5 p.m., and from April through September it stays open until 7 p.m. Whatever burdens you may be carrying in your own life, whatever problems may be weighing you down, a few hours walking the quiet pathways of Arlington will remind you of the sacrifice and service of people you never met, people who wanted the country to endure so that new generations could live, and hope to prosper, and strive to enjoy. To visit Arlington is to understand anew the true meaning of an ancient phrase: . Paying our respects. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: There's a place in Washington that isn't a top tourist spot .
He says Arlington National Cemetery is a place all Americans should visit .
More than 300,000 are bured at Arlington, including the famous .

"(CNN) -- They're not just constant characters on a television screen, these candidates who every four years seek the presidency. They're not present only to give us something to talk about for months on end. ""What you feel like on certain days is a slow-moving target,"" said George Herbert Walker Bush, reflecting on the unsuccessful campaign when he sought reelection to the White House. They grin and wave at crowds, asking for our votes while implying eternal sunniness. To reveal that they are vulnerable to hurt would seem to be an admission of weakness. ""I didn't like it,"" Gerald Ford said, speaking of being defeated when he ran on his own for president. ""I was sad. But I never let my feelings be reflected publicly. ... Inwardly, inwardly. I never let it out. It's not my nature."" The candidates know that only one person can win a presidential election, and that the loser, no matter how accomplished, will forever be associated with the fact of his defeat. Sometimes it is the incumbent; sometimes it is a challenger. The feeling of emptiness is the same, although the men who have lived in the White House and have then been denied a second term understand especially well just what it is they will be leaving behind. News: Polling center--down to the wire . ""I think when I lost the reelection campaign for the presidency,"" Jimmy Carter said, ""I think I did my best, and although Rosalynn was pretty -- well, bitter -- after the loss, I was not. I had to spend a long time assuaging her disappointment -- I'm sure she would agree with this if she was here in the room right now -- and I said to her, 'Rosalynn, we have a good life ahead of us.'"" In my conversations over the decades with men who have served as president of the United States and who have had to leave office before they wanted to, we have spent significant time talking about the emotions that accompany the leave-taking. These are men who have reached a pinnacle the rest of us will never come close to achieving. Yet when they are turned away, their past accomplishments cannot fully soothe the sting. On Tuesday night, two men of considerable talent, soaring ambition and lifetimes full of triumphs will find out which one of them has been selected for a job they each covet, and which one has been rejected. Either Barack Obama or Mitt Romney is certain to be wounded to his core, even while the other man is celebrating to wild cheers. News: If Obama wins a second term... Very few people have known what it is like, on that highest of levels, to be seen as having failed. ""If I had feelings,"" Richard Nixon said, ""I probably wouldn't have even survived."" His own final leave-taking, of course, was different from an election-night defeat. He had lost the presidency on a November night in 1960, then won it on November nights in 1968 and 1972. He might well have assumed that the defeats of his life were all past tense. And then came the resignation at the height of the Watergate crisis in August of 1974. He was defiant -- proudly so -- in not wanting to be seen as actively seeking sympathy. ""I never wanted to be buddy-buddy,"" he said. ""Not only with the press. Even with close friends. I don't believe in letting your hair down, confessing this and that and the other thing -- saying, 'Gee, I couldn't sleep, because I was worrying about this or that.' I believe you should keep your troubles to yourself. News: If Romney wins... ""That's just the way I am. Some people are different. Some people think it's good therapy to sit with a close friend and, you know, just spill your guts ... so perhaps the younger generation should go in every time they are asked how they feel about this or that, and they should reveal their inner psyche -- whether they were breast-fed, or bottle-fed. ""Not me. No way."" The first President Bush, in talking about the pain of losing to Bill Clinton in 1992, also bristled at the memory of being expected to reveal to the public his private feelings: ""I didn't feel comfortable with all this 'Larry King Live' and MTV,"" he said. He imitated the voice of a hard-bitten political adviser: ""'Everybody else has been on MTV, you gotta show 'em you can communicate with the youth.' I kept being told ... "" He let his voice trail off. Carter, recalling his 1980 loss to Ronald Reagan, told me: ""So, yeah -- I think there is a lot of misapprehension about who a person is, even when he's being looked at all the time. ... A lot of the reporters who almost sort of condemned everything I'd done and said, and they were insinuating that I didn't have any intelligence, I didn't have any judgment, I didn't have any moral convictions ... I mean, it wasn't unanimous, but it was there. And even the reporters who were most negative about me, in my post-presidential years they have said, 'Wow, this guy has finally listened to what I said about him as president, and he's changed his ways now, he's got a little bit of sense, a little bit of judgment. ...'"" Opinion: Stand up for centrist candidates . Carter laughed, with more than a hint of harshness. ""I don't think I've changed,"" he said. On Tuesday night, the man who loses will have to assure his supporters that he and his family will be just fine. Betty Ford told me that her husband, after his defeat, did his level best to give that impression. ""He really did try to be very stoic in his face,"" she said. ""He told us that there always has to be a winner and there always has to be a loser, and that you shouldn't be in politics if you aren't aware of that. We didn't talk a lot about it, because there was no sense in dwelling on it. We both felt pretty terrible. But we couldn't change it."" The real anguish Tuesday night will take place behind closed doors. Few will bear witness. In the 1972 election, George McGovern, who died last month at the age of 90, was wiped out by Richard Nixon. McGovern's press secretary, a novelist and former Los Angeles Times reporter named Dick Dougherty, later recalled what it was like to be in McGovern's hotel room that evening as McGovern was, line by line, editing his concession speech: . ""His eyes welled over and a tear fell that was so large it splashed when it struck the top of his hand. A terrible sound came from him that was like a giggle except that it was as much a sob as a giggle. He got up. He said: 'I don't know why I do that when I'm sad -- why I laugh.' He moved quickly toward the bathroom. [McGovern's wife] Eleanor, beginning to cry again, said: 'George always does that. He always laughs when he feels most badly. ...'"" They are not just names and moving images on millions upon millions of smart phone screens, these people who ask us to make them our president. And one of them, on one November night every four years, finds out what it is like to be told: Sorry. We've decided to go with someone else. Opinion: Crowley -- It's the losing campaigns I remember most . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Candidates who lose a presidential race have deep, if unexpressed, feelings .
He says many challengers lose, but losing incumbents he's talked to also had complex emotions .
Ford said it wasn't his nature to outwardly lament defeat; Nixon defiant, not seeking sympathy .

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday night, it will be time to meet the candidates. Again. There will be a Republican presidential debate, this one hosted by CNN, the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute. This is the 14th televised debate, depending on how you're counting (there was that two-person debate between Newt Gingrich and Herman Cain), since they began back in May. For generations we have taken it for granted that the way we meet our would-be presidents is on television. But, of course, it was not always so. For a good portion of the existence of the United States, the process of choosing a president must have felt like trying to decipher a distant and indistinct rumor. ""Every generation, because of advances in communications technology, thinks that it knows the candidates, and the president, better than the generations that came before,"" said John G. Geer, chairman of the department of political science at Vanderbilt University and co-director of the Vanderbilt Poll. ""But of course, it all comes down to the question: Even when we think we know a candidate, or a president, what do we really know?"" Think of the earliest days of the United States -- and the earliest elections. Pamphlets, handbills, seventh-hand retellings of speeches the teller may or may not have actually heard ... the first (and second and third and beyond) generations of Americans elected as president men who, if they had passed them on the street, they might not have recognized. Geer believes that readers of American newspapers in those days devoured them with a level of gratitude unfamiliar today: ""Reading the paper was seen as a treat -- today, there is so much information, on the Internet and everywhere else, that it overwhelms people. But readers eagerly looked forward to reading the papers back then, because that was their best chance to learn about the world."" Most people today take it for granted that a president will be a constantly televised visitor in their homes -- it has never been any other way for them. But more than 70 percent of all U.S. presidents served in the years before television sets were first installed in homes. Harry Truman was the first president to appear on TV the way we know it (although Franklin Delano Roosevelt took part in a television experiment at the 1939 New York World's Fair). More than 60 percent of our presidents were never heard on radio; Warren G. Harding, who entered office in 1921, was the first to speak on commercial radio. The voice of Theodore Roosevelt, as large as he loomed in the American mind, was never heard in American homes when he was in the White House. What in our era that would be unthinkable -- a president who did not regularly speak to us -- was, to Americans of a century or so ago, just a fact of life. Rutherford B. Hayes was the first president whose voice was recorded. The first to be filmed was William McKinley, who took office in 1897. Before McKinley, presidents appeared to the public only in still photographs. And almost a quarter of our presidents didn't have their pictures taken while in office or running for office. James K. Polk is widely believed to have been the first; George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe ... the Americans they led had no opportunity to see, photographically, what they looked like. In that era, voters could view their presidents and would-be presidents through reproductions of oil paintings of heroic-looking figures (put forth by the men themselves) or crude and insulting cartoons (put forth by their opponents). All of this has little to do with the presidents -- they had no control over the technology of their times -- and everything to do with the citizens. It always has been such a leap of faith, deciding who is deserving of one's vote. For all the media manipulation that goes on in the television age, consider the mischief that could be done in the era when presidents and candidates went largely unheard and, before that, unseen. The day is probably coming -- perhaps soon -- when some long-shot candidate will make a promise that, if elected, he will wear a tiny live video camera in the lapel of his suit jacket, so that Americans, in real time on their computer screens and telephones, can see and hear everything that he is seeing and hearing in the White House, from his vantage point. (And if elected, he will quickly announce that for reasons of national security, he won't be able to use the lapel camera much, after all.) The leap of faith is the same as ever. We have to tell ourselves that we know our presidents, even if we've never met them. No American ever saw Herbert Hoover talking live on television; no American ever heard Ulysses S. Grant speaking on the radio; no American ever heard Abraham Lincoln's recorded voice. John Adams? No American ever saw a photo of him. Yet they all had to find a way to appeal to the entire country -- to get the majority of the nation to declare: He's the one. Every four years, we roll the dice anew. Do we truly know the people who would be president any better now than our ancestors did when they had never seen the candidates' faces or had any idea what their voices sounded like? Of necessity, each generation evaluates a candidate -- and a president -- based on what the voters have available at the time. Vanderbilt's Geer said that we sometimes forget the specifics of that and the limitations. ""Before microphones, the candidate with a booming voice had a great advantage,"" he said. ""Think about it. When candidates had to speak to large crowds without the benefit of a microphone, a person with a quiet voice didn't even stand a chance of reaching the crowd and having his words heard."" In the end, though, according to Geer, all campaigning through various forms of media provides only a rough facsimile of what the person asking for votes is like. ""Imagine if every person in the country was somehow able to have a five-minute meeting with a candidate for president,"" he said. ""Just the two of them, alone. I think we all would have a very different feeling about who we're voting for. I think that would change everything."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Americans think they know their presidents because they are always present on TV .

"(CNN) -- One day there will be no one alive who remembers. Today, as we solemnly observe the tenth anniversary of September 11, 2001, virtually every living American adult has his or her own vivid memory of that morning. It all feels very personal, because it was. And is. But 100 years from now, 150 years from now, when everyone who remembers is gone, what will the legacy of the terrible day have evolved into? And will the war be over? That is the essential question. The war on terror is unlike any other the United States has fought, and because of this there can be no genuine sense of closure, even after ceremonies as moving and heartfelt as the ones planned for Sunday will certainly be. The nation can express respect, and sorrow, and determined resolve on this 10th anniversary of the day. But closure -- bowing heads and praying one more time, and then moving on? Not possible, with this war. The morning after will arrive on schedule on Monday, but the nature of the war in which we are engaged almost guarantees a succession of mornings after without end. I have a copy of a memo of sorts, a teletype, that was sent out in September 1945. Its author was not identified by name, but by title: Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers. The recipients were his colleagues: the commanding general of the Eighth Army, the commanding general of the Tenth Army, the commander of the Third Fleet. . . . I look at the memo from time to time because it is such a stark reminder of the way our current war will not conclude. The text, in that teletype style of those years, was all in capital letters: . ""FORMAL SURRENDER OF THE JAPANESE IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT BY JAPANESE IMPERIAL GENERAL HEADQUARTERS AND ALL JAPANESE AND JAPANESE CONTROLLED ARMED FORCES WHEREVER LOCATED WAS SIGNED ON THE BATTLESHIP MISSOURI IN TOKYO BAY AT 0908 ON SEPTEMBER 2ND 1945."" And that was it: The Second World War was over. We may be destined to have no day like that. As much death and devastation as there was during World War II, as many families who lost their young soldiers, at least the nightmare ended. It may have been difficult for Americans to believe for a while -- after the years of war, it may have seemed too good to be true: Peace had come. But eventually Americans must have begun to awaken without the knots in their stomachs, without the fear for loved ones in their hearts. The danger had been defeated; the enemy was vanquished. The war was past tense. Ours is not. The enemy, as we have been told from the start, wears no uniform, flies no flag. On Sunday we mourn and give renewed thanks for the bravery of those who were so valiant in trying to save lives 10 years ago. And Monday the sun will rise over a nation still wishing for true tranquillity. Mornings after, forevermore. There is a phrase that has been used in the context both of soldiers and of civilians in past U.S. wars: ""for the duration."" The phrase has signified that life will be altered until the war is over. But what happens when ""for the duration"" has no end date? When the duration is infinite? Another wartime phrase: ""on full alert."" Yet no person, no nation, can remain on full alert indefinitely. The body -- the human body, the body politic -- is not made for it. Full alert is an emergency response. And when the emergency never ends, guards -- both physical and emotional -- are inevitably let down, not by choice but out of pure fatigue. The men and women who personally recall December 7, 1941, are dying off. The day of the attack on Pearl Harbor is remembered firsthand by relatively few Americans, and because of that, there are years when the anniversary of the date -- the date President Franklin D. Roosevelt vowed would live in infamy -- is allowed to pass with little notice. That is something to ponder on this September 11 anniversary, as we consider how the date will be marked a century and more from now when there is no one left alive to remember what it felt like, no one who wept on that morning. Perhaps -- even probably -- there will be additional awful days that Americans will face, more dates that will be recalled with tears. September 11, 2001, may be pushed toward the middle of the history books, regarded as an older sorrow. And there will be generations of children whose birthdays are September 11, generations of husbands and wives whose wedding dates, and anniversaries, will be September 11. The notion may seem a little odd, now, but in fact it has already begun. The world, saddened, turns on its axis. It has no other choice. The morning after always arrives. The act of remembrance, meant to help, still hurts. It does today. It will tomorrow. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene says years from now, many may not remember 9/11. Will the war even be over?

"(CNN) -- Maybe you know the phrase: . ""Get off the phone!"" It was commonly heard in American households in the years when land-line telephones were the only phones there were. The bellowing might come from your dad, your sister -- from whoever in your family wanted to use the telephone, and who felt that you had been monopolizing it for too many minutes: . ""Get off the phone!"" The admonition seemed to have disappeared once cell phones gained ascendancy, and everyone suddenly had their own personal, portable phones. Your phone was yours and yours alone. Who could tell you to hang up? Well, we all may be about to find out. From the government, to professional associations, to business owners, a common and serious-minded accord appears to be forming. So don't be at all surprised if 2012 turns out to be the year when a national chorus of voices joins together to say ... You know. Get off the phone. The National Transportation Safety Board has called for a nationwide ban on the use of cell phones by drivers. This would include hands-free devices as well as hand-held phones. The reasoning is basic: Drivers distracted by phone calls are a danger; drivers who send or receive text messages while behind the wheel, or who play games or update social networks on their phones, are as potentially deadly as drunken drivers. ""No call, no text, no update is worth a human life,"" said NTSB chairman Deborah Hersman. She's right, of course, and if the proposal had been made in the days before cell phones became popular, there would be little controversy over it. Make telephone calls while driving? It would have sounded preposterous -- what were you supposed to do, get a 50-mile-long extension cord? -- and motorists would have instinctively understood the perils. The first rule of safety, drilled into generations of beginning drivers: Keep both hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road. But it is far from certain that the NTSB will get its way. The recommendation is for the 50 states to pass no-phones-while-driving laws. Elected legislators can be expected to be hesitant about upsetting their constituents. The problem is that they would be taking away something citizens are already doing every day, and that many motorists would resist giving up. Yet the same person who bristles when told that he or she should not be allowed to talk on the phone while behind the wheel -- ""What if it's an emergency? I have to at least answer the phone to find out"" -- likely would have a different reaction when asked, on a dark, rainy, wind-swept night: You're on a two-lane road. You see a car coming around the next turn. Do you want that other driver to be in the middle of a phone call, or texting? The distractions and temptations inherent to constant cell phone use extend well beyond the highways. Matt Richtel of the New York Times recently reported about a troubling situation at hospitals and doctors' offices: . Physicians and staff members have constant access to smartphones, tablets and computers, which are supposed to make them more efficient. But Richtel reported instances of ""a neurosurgeon making personal calls during an operation, a nurse checking airfares during surgery and a poll showing that half of technicians running bypass machines had admitted texting during a procedure."" Dr. Peter J. Papadakos, director of critical care at the University of Rochester (N.Y.) Medical Center, told Richtel: ""You walk around the hospital, and what you see is not funny ... My gut feeling is lives are in danger."" Business owners and associations have, for years, quietly been trying to come up with workplace rules that will allow them to get a full day's work from their employees, while not infuriating those same employees who are accustomed to having their cell phones always turned on. It's another case of the horse having long ago escaped from the barn, and leaving the door wide open. In the days before cell phones, if business owners had been asked to allow their employees to install personal phone lines and use the phones whenever they wished, it would have sounded like a joke. The owners would have said: Of course not. This is work. But, in the wireless era, it happened almost before anyone noticed. In Lewiston, Idaho, Peggy Hayden, a writer for the business section of the Lewiston Tribune, surveyed business owners in north-central Idaho and southeastern Washington. Many reported a ""Get off the phone!"" policy. ""It's not what I am paying them for,"" Derek Weinmann, a food store manager, told Hayden for her story. He said cell phone use on company time was simply not allowed. Restaurant operator Bruce Finch told Hayden: ""Employees should leave their phones in their cars, or they can leave them in a basket in the manager's office."" James Nash, spokesman for a manufacturing firm, said signs are posted telling employees that cell phones are not permitted on the factory floor. (But what about bosses around the country who call or text employees on their cell phones after the employees have gone home for the day, or the weekend? Shouldn't this cut both ways? If cell phones and personal calls are banned at work, shouldn't employers be expected to provide overtime payment to their employees for work-related calls made, and text messages sent, to them after business hours?) The NTSB is committed as can be about the push to outlaw cell phones in cars. ""The time to act is now,"" said chairman Hersman. ""How many more lives will be lost before we, as a society, change our attitudes about the deadliness of distractions?"" Plenty of lives, undoubtedly. But the NTSB is likely to fail in its effort. That horse that escaped from the barn is galloping down the road. Past miles and miles of cars whose drivers are in the middle of phone calls, confident that they -- if not the other guy -- can easily handle it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: There is growing chorus of officials, employers urging less cell phone use .

"(CNN) -- Recent revelations about the extent of government phone and Internet surveillance are already shaking up the national debate. But these programs are just symptoms of broader changes that will be shaking up our government and society for many decades to come. Let's not cheapen or simplify the debate by trying to ram these revelations into the GOP-friendly framework of ""another Obama scandal."" We should be honest and admit that something much bigger than that is going on here. The implication of the issue for our politics will be felt long after today's round of political ""gotcha"" and ""pin the tail on the donkey"" has faded away. The FBI and National Security Agency have been mining Internet servers, searching for e-mails, videos and other documents under a program code-named PRISM for six years. First, let me be clear: I am an opponent of PRISM. As a matter of first principles, I oppose overreaching, unaccountable spy programs. That's why I supported neither the so-called Patriot Act, nor the reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, when those measures were first considered by Congress. Nor was I supportive when President George W. Bush aggressively deployed his new powers. Nor was I supportive when evidence began to emerge that the government was interpreting overly broad laws in an overly broad manner. And I am not supportive now. Even as a former Obama administration official, I am always willing, when necessary, to constructively criticize the White House on matters of national importance. But I oppose those who would try to pretend that this is somehow ""another Obama scandal."" It is not. What is happening is broader than that: All three branches of government and both political parties are implicated. Congress passed the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and both the Obama and Bush administrations have implemented these programs. This is not a partisan issue. In fact, it is much larger than any political scandal du jour. We are seeing the collision of two new forces in our society with something old, but precious. New: The ability of terrorists, including lone wolves, to strike us at any time, including with weapons of massive destruction. New: Information technology that gives the government extraordinary spying abilities, far beyond what was technically feasible even a decade ago. Old: Our Constitution, written centuries before programs like PRISM could even be imagined, yet a rightly revered document that should guide us still today. How we balance these three factors is one of the great challenges for this generation of Americans. Indeed, the collision is actually turning our political parties inside out. There are ""state powers versus civil liberties"" fights happening within both parties. Presidents Obama and Bush line up on one side, together. On the other side are such strange bedfellows as Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon; Rand Paul, R-Kentucky; and Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon. The issues are so deep, profound and even existential that neither party has a stable, predictable, internal consensus. Translation: Arguments will be heated over this balance in both parties' presidential debates. In the Democratic primary and during the 2016 convention, champions of civil liberties will certainly challenge Obama pragmatists over government spying. This will be especially true if Vice President Joe Biden and/or former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton seek the presidency. Meanwhile, inside the GOP, right-wing libertarians will challenge security hawks over the same issue. It is uncertain which side in which party will win this debate. But for once, at least, we are about to enter territory that cannot easily be viewed through the lens of ""party versus party."" The battle to define the proper balance between civil liberties and national security is more likely to emerge as a case of ""principle versus principle,"" fought out inside each party. The resulting dynamic could create very interesting political coalitions in 2016 and even a new ""issue map"" for American politics -- completely redrawn by one of the defining debates of our time. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Van Jones.","Van Jones: Spying programs are symptoms of broader, long-lasting changes .
Jones: This is not ""another Obama scandal;"" all government branches and parties involved .

"(CNN) -- In his second inaugural address last month, President Barack Obama forcefully articulated a case for confronting the climate crisis. In his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, I encourage him to lay out a plan on it. I realize Congress can be an obstacle. A few years ago, the right and left discussed how best to tackle the climate crisis. Today, it has become an article of faith among some conservatives to ignore science and deny there is a human-made crisis at all. Just last week, Sen. Marco Rubio, the oft-touted 2016 GOP savior who will deliver the Republican response to the State of the Union, falsely claimed there was ""reasonable debate"" on the issue. There isn't. There is no alternative but to act. As if the warnings from scientists weren't enough, in 2012 -- the hottest year on record in the contiguous U.S. -- we saw the true face of climate change: freak storms, raging wildfires, a new Dust Bowl in the heartland and devastating damages. Most heartbreakingly, innocent lives were lost. Here's what Obama can do to help stop climate change -- and what he should announce in his speech on Tuesday night. Opinion: Obama's chance to lead, or kick the can down the road . 1. Negotiate a bilateral agreement with China . New Secretary of State John Kerry declared climate change a ""life-threatening issue"" at his confirmation hearing. Obama should make his chief diplomat's top priority the crafting of a bilateral agreement with China to reduce carbon pollution and accelerate clean energy. Even if the Doha climate negotiations produce a treaty with teeth, the Senate will refuse to ratify it unless China is on board. Growing concerns about air pollution have the Chinese government talking about renewable energy. An agreement between the two largest emitters of greenhouse gasses would set the whole planet on a more sustainable path. The best thing about this option: Obama does not need Congress' approval to start the dialogue. Furthermore, he can use the buildup to the Doha climate summit as an opportunity to educate the public about the real dangers of climate chaos. 2. Stop the Keystone XL Pipeline . Some scientists liken building the pipeline to lighting the fuse on the world's biggest carbon bomb. According to industry experts, without the demand from this pipeline, most of the oil in the Alberta tar sands would stay safely in the ground. Instead, Keystone would funnel the dirtiest oil on Earth from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which would do nothing to reduce our dependence on foreign energy while causing irreparable harm. In return, we could get higher gas prices, risk of a BP-like spill in the heartland and fewer jobs than there are people employed in the wind industry right now. 3. Use executive branch powers . Although Obama cannot institute a carbon tax without Congress, he is not without options. The Environmental Protection Agency used its authority to regulate carbon dioxide as a source of pollution and set higher standards for power plants. The EPA could go further. Obama should also support the efforts of the EPA to set new standards for soot based on the best and latest science. The administration could also open more public land for renewable energy development. Finally, the president should publicly commit to making sure coal miners emerge as winners in the transition to clean energy jobs. At the least, the people who sacrifice their health to bring us power deserve secure pensions, world class health care and the opportunity to be trained in the industries of the future. Twenty years from today, we could live in an age defined by ever-more-violent storms and watch as other nations stake out a crucial advantage in clean energy technology. Or, we can reject that future now and lead a healthier, more prosperous world well into the 21st century. Tackling the issue entails some political risks. But the president should know that if he leads, a movement will rise to stand behind him. This Sunday, tens of thousands of Americans are expected to gather in Washington for the massive ""Forward on Climate"" Rally. They will be joined by thousands more across the nation. A generation from now, this president's legacy will be measured by his record on climate. Strong words in the inaugural address were just the starting point. On Tuesday, we need to hear a concrete plan. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Van Jones.","Van Jones: President Obama should lay out a plan on climate crisis in his SOTU speech .
Jones: Obama should push for a bilateral agreement with China to reduce carbon pollution .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday night, on a small patch of lawn in central Ohio, generations of people bearing affection and gratitude will gather to say one last goodbye to Miss Barbara. That's what she was called her entire adult life, and that's the way she wanted it. Barbara Drugan was 85 when she died in the waning days of September, as a new school year was getting started. She was a young woman just out of St. Mary of the Springs Academy and the Ohio State University when, in 1947, she commenced her life's work: teaching kindergarten in Bexley, Ohio. For 32 years, Miss Barbara would greet new, nervous, excited groups of 5-year-olds in her classroom at the south end of the first-floor hallway of Cassingham Elementary School on Cassingham Road. That is where the memorial gathering will be held on Wednesday night: on the lawn right outside the window of her old classroom. And the reason the town will gather for Miss Barbara ... Well, if you have ever lived in a community in which one person's devotion to the town, and to its residents, is a part of everyone's memory, then you will understand. Miss Barbara never forgot a child's face or a child's name, even when the boys and girls had grown older and had children and grandchildren of their own. How she did it, I don't know. She knew your name, she knew your parents' names, she knew your brothers' and sisters' names -- 20, 30, 40 years after you had left her kindergarten class, she knew. ""She was everything to this town,"" said Tim Madison, an attorney who lives in Bexley and who was a child in Miss Barbara's kindergarten class in 1969. ""She was a part of the town's life for as long as many of us can ever remember. And she remembered each one of us."" That matters. In a world where relationships can be fast and fleeting, that matters. For generations, men and women who had once been her students would sometimes move away, pursuing jobs elsewhere or starting families in other parts of the country. When they would return for a visit years later and run into Miss Barbara as she walked around town, the sight of her face and the sound of her welcoming voice made it official: They were home. She dealt with the ups and downs that are a part of a long life with a smile and the will to keep on going. After she retired, there was an item in a local newspaper saying that the school had decided to have crossing guards at Cassingham Road and Fair Avenue. There had always been patrol boys and girls at the other end of the block -- at Cassingham and Elm, where there was a stoplight. But now the school was looking for adults to help out at the unguarded far end, and the story in the paper announced a time and place for a meeting for volunteers. Miss Barbara went to the meeting. She was the only one to show up. And for the next 27 years, as she grew old, she was on that corner every day, helping the children get safely to school. She was there in the rain and she was there in the snow, and once I asked her if it wouldn't be better for her to stay home in such foul weather. No, she said; that's when it was most important for her to be on duty, when visibility was bad and accidents more likely. In 1952, in Miss Barbara's kindergarten class, I met Jack Roth, who would become my friend for the next 52 years -- my oldest friend in life. Miss Barbara watched the friendship begin. When Jack died of cancer in 2004, and his wife and daughter asked me to deliver the eulogy at his funeral, it was a very difficult day to get through. At the end of the service, as I followed his casket up the aisle, I felt a hand reach out from one of the seats, and hold my own hand. Of course. Miss Barbara. She never married; if you read the formal obituaries last week, you might have surmised that she never had children. But that is untrue. She had hundreds of children; hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds, who she never forgot, and who never forgot her. Who loved her then. Who love her still. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene says a favorite kindergarten teacher died; her service is Wednesday .
He says the teacher, Miss Barbara, was much beloved and bound to her Ohio town .
He says she remembered names, was a touchstone for many; later was crossing guard .
Greene: In a fragmented world of fleeting relationships, Miss Barbara mattered ."
"(CNN) -- Elvis was singing in the men's room. But I'd gotten used to that. This time, though, there was something new. And it led me, after all these years, to the legendary Barbara Hearn. A little explanation -- all right, a lot of explanation -- is in order: . There's a restaurant in Naples, Florida, called BrickTop's. I stop in there occasionally when I'm in town. In the men's restroom, every time I've gone in, Elvis Presley's voice is singing. Oddly, his voice is not heard out in the restaurant itself. But in the restroom, the voice is there nonstop. ""Are You Lonesome Tonight?"", ""(Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame"". . .the Elvis-in-the-men's-room playlist is rather eclectic. The other night I was eating at the restaurant and, of course, Elvis was singing in the men's room. But there had been an addition to the restroom dÃ©cor since my last visit six months or so ago. There was a framed, autographed photo on the wall, of a young Elvis smiling next to a dark-haired woman. The autograph was hers. The signature: Barbara Hearn Smith. For Presley aficionados, the name Barbara Hearn is as historic as that of Martha Washington or Betsy Ross or Mary Todd Lincoln. She was Elvis's hometown girlfriend in Memphis at the beginning of 1956, just before his career hit the stratosphere. That was the year everything changed; by the time it was over, Presley's old life was in the rear-view mirror. And part of that old life, presumably, was Barbara Hearn. But now, in the dwindling weeks of 2011, in the BrickTop's men's room, here was Elvis singing, and here was Barbara Hearn's autograph. A closer inspection of the handwriting revealed that she was saying she had dined at another BrickTop's, in Nashville, Tennessee. So she still strides the American continent? I had to find her. I did -- at the Holly Tree Manor Bed and Breakfast in Trenton, Tennessee, which she and her husband of 50 years, Jim Smith, own and run. She's 74, and she laughed out loud when I told her where I had found her photo. ""Well, I suppose it's all right if my name is on a restroom wall,"" she said. ""It's better than if my phone number was up there."" She said that she and her husband had been having lunch at the BrickTop's in Nashville when a waiter had overheard them talking about Elvis. When he realized that she had actually known Elvis, he said that the boss of the place -- Joe Ledbetter -- was a huge Presley fan. Jim Smith went out to their car, where he knew there was a photo of Elvis and Barbara; he brought it into the restaurant, and she signed it so the waiter could give it to the boss when he came in. (I got in touch with Ledbetter, who runs all six BrickTop's locations, most of which are in the South. He told me he'd had copies made of the photo, and ordered that they be put in nice frames and hung in the men's and women's restrooms of all his restaurants. He said that the nonstop Elvis songs do not discriminate by gender: They are in the women's rooms as well as in the men's rooms. Why? He loves Elvis. Why not play Elvis's music in the restaurants themselves -- why just in the bathrooms? ""It would drive some customers nuts to hear it for so long. In the restrooms, you're just there for a few minutes."") But back to Barbara Hearn: She said she first met Elvis when she was working at Goldsmith's Department Store in Memphis with a friend named Dixie Locke, who was dating Presley. When Dixie and Elvis went their separate ways, he asked Barbara if he could take her out. ""People sometimes say that Elvis and I went steady for a year,"" she told me. ""I always correct them. I went steady with Elvis for a year. Elvis? Well, he didn't go steady with anyone."" But she was his girlfriend during his remarkable ascent in 1956. There is a famous photograph, taken by Alfred Wertheimer inside the home on Audubon Drive in Memphis that Presley shared with his parents (this was pre-Graceland). In the photo, Barbara is prim in a white dress with dark polka-dots; Elvis is slouched and shirtless. ""People don't understand what's in that picture,"" she told me. ""He had just been outside standing in his new swimming pool. It was just being filled up, with a garden hose. I was dressed to go out with him for the evening, all gussied up. And what we're doing is, he had just taken the train back from New York, where he had recorded some new songs for RCA Victor. He had brought back the recordings -- they had not been released yet. We were listening to one of them. He wanted to know if I thought it was any good. I said yes, I thought it was. It was 'Don't Be Cruel.'"" Soon enough he went to Hollywood; by the end of that year, he would be bringing Natalie Wood to Memphis to meet his parents. (""I didn't hold it against him at all,"" Barbara told me. ""If the roles had been reversed, and I had been the one to go to Hollywood and I'd met Gregory Peck, I would have brought Gregory Peck back to Memphis with me."") She eventually went to work in Washington for one of Tennessee's U.S. senators, Estes Kefauver. It was there that she met her future husband. She saw Elvis only infrequently over the years, and never lost her affection toward him. ""That year of 1956, I saw him go from being barely famous to a super-duper star,"" she said. ""From a boy to a man."" And now, more than half a century later, there they are, in the restaurant restrooms, accompanied by the sound of his voice. She said she'd had no idea, until I told her. ""What a hoot,"" she said, and laughed again. ""He's a friend who never stops giving."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene says he saw a framed photo of a woman with Elvis Presley .

"(CNN) -- All around the world today, people are in the early hours of trying to keep their New Year's resolutions: Lose that 15 pounds, find that job that will make you happy, move to that city where you've always dreamed of living. There is one kind of resolution, though, that very few of us will ever be in a position to make. Somewhere today, someone at the very pinnacle of his or her career is thinking of doing in 2012 what Tony La Russa did in 2011: . Get out on top. Willingly walk away and declare victory. Leave the table while the dice are still hot. La Russa was the manager of the St. Louis Cardinals who, within days of guiding his team to victory in the World Series, announced that he was done. It has never happened before in baseball, according to historians of the sport. No manager before La Russa ever retired in the same calendar year his team won the Series. Human nature tells us to hang on while success is at its peak. You don't see many CEOs who have just led their corporations to record profits say: I have nothing left to prove. I'm through -- it's been fun. Who does that, when further riches and accolades await? The inner knowledge that things may never be this good again competes against the thought that cruising speed can be exceedingly comfortable once you've made it to the apex. Who reaches the top of the mountain and then, with the cheers still ringing, decides: No more mountaintops for me? It happens in sports, once in a great while. Rocky Marciano retired from boxing in 1956 as undefeated heavyweight champion of the world. Jim Brown walked away from professional football after the 1965 season while still the best running back in the sport. They had won the game, literally. They left the field and never looked back. How difficult is that -- not to look back? There are two schools of thought, each completely understandable. Consider the Beatles. Then consider Michael Jordan. In 1970 the Beatles, having accomplished everything, officially disbanded and never again shared a public stage. Less than a decade after they said goodbye to their fans, I had dinner with Ringo Starr, and asked him about it. He was adamant that the band -- all four were still alive at the time -- had made the right decision, and would stick to it. I told him I'd read that a promoter had offered $45 million for the Beatles to sing together one more time. ""I think it was 50 million,"" Starr said. ""But the thing is, we don't want to do it. We don't want to get together. And if we did want to get together, we could do it ourselves; we wouldn't need anybody from the outside offering us any money. I think these promoters keep coming up with these big money offers just to get their names in the paper. It makes them little heroes for a day."" I told him that there were many people who never got to see the Beatles perform, and yearned for the chance. Starr shook his head. ""A lot of people say, 'I never saw them, and I want to see them just once,' "" he said. ""Well, I never saw the Beatles, either. I really wish I could have, but unfortunately I was onstage. I would have loved to have been out in the audience and have seen the Beatles. I would have liked to see what all the excitement was about."" But, he said, it was over. For the fans -- and for the musicians -- the memories would have to be enough. Michael Jordan was a different story. His resolve to stay away for good was short-lived. He missed terribly that which he had loved. During his first retirement from basketball, the Bulls' management put up a statue of Jordan outside the United Center in Chicago. One night I asked him about it. ""Do I look like a statue to you?"" he said. ""I'm not a statue. The whole thing makes me feel very strange. A statue just stands still forever while people stare at it. I'm a person. I'm alive."" I asked if he ever planned to drive by the arena and look at the statue. ""No,"" he said. ""It's not something I have whole lot of interest in doing -- driving out to see myself in front of a building. What am I going to do? Get out of my car and toss coins at myself for luck? ""It's a piece of metal. It's stuck in one place. It doesn't move. I'm a man."" It wasn't overly surprising when Jordan returned to the NBA, and then, after a second retirement, when he did it again. A few months ago, in New York, I unexpectedly ran into him on the sidewalk. As we stood speaking on Lexington Avenue near 50th Street, people catching sight of him did stop and stare almost as if they were looking at a statue. In 2009, in a speech at the Basketball Hall of Fame, Jordan said that he might play again when he was 50. When the audience reacted as if it was a joke, Jordan said: ""Oh, don't laugh. Never say never."" Next month, he turns 49. The Beatles stuck to their vow, and now, with John Lennon and George Harrison long dead, the vow is destined to last forever. Jordan? It doesn't seem likely that he'll un-retire one more time, however briefly, to prove something to himself, but stranger things have happened. Happy new year to the rest of us. We'll never have a choice like that. But somewhere in the United States today, someone at the very top of his or her field is almost certainly thinking about it. When you've loved doing something for your whole life, can you wave goodbye to it before you have to? Ask Tony La Russa a year from now. It can be harder than it looks. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: At New Year, consider those, like Cardinals' La Russa, who quit while ahead .
He asks: How many of us could make a resolution like that? How many could not look back?

Greene: Somewhere someone at top of field is mulling quitting in 2012. it's harder than it looks ."
"(CNN) -- Yes, I said it, and I will say it again: On Wednesday night, Sen. Rand Paul was a hero for civil liberties. I love and respect President Obama, and I was honored to work for the Obama White House. That said, the executive branch of the United States government today has an extraordinary level of power. Progressives like Rep. Keith Ellison and conservatives like Paul can all agree it has a disturbing license to wage a never-ending, ill-defined, even un-defined ""war on terror,"" including the use of drones. I applaud Rand Paul for standing up and calling attention to an important and vexing set of questions. Now, let me say to my conservative friends: Do not get too excited. I still believe Paul is as much a villain on civil rights as he was a hero this week on civil liberties. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s successful strategy was to force the federal government to intercede not just with states, but also private businesses that denied equal treatment. Paul would have robbed King's strategy of its teeth, because he does not believe the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution grants the federal government the right to protect individuals from racial discrimination in the marketplace. In fact, he once said businesses should be able to turn people away based on the color of their skin. Also, please do not get me started on his votes against the Violence Against Women Act. Nor on his opposition to a woman's right to make private medical decisions. Nor on his desire to cut Social Security and Medicare, while preserving tax loopholes for the wealthiest people ever born. But we cannot be so balkanized as a nation that we refuse to say ""well done,"" when someone does right, even if we disagree on everything else. We are bigger than that. The idea of using military drones inside U.S. borders should trigger concern and scrutiny from all points on the political spectrum. To my progressive friends: The argument should not be whether we trust THIS president not to abuse that kind of authority. The next president might. If a GOP president refused to rule out killing U.S. citizens on U.S. soil without due process, we progressives would be marching down the street. We must be vigilant and consistent. There is a risk that any White House will develop delusions about its own power. The amount of information that top officials get is so overwhelming, and the level of responsibility so crushing, that there is always the temptation to think, ""We know more than the public."" It is a shame that it was Rand Paul, not progressives and liberals in the Senate, who led this filibuster. Not only that, we can admire that Paul used the filibuster the way it should be used. He did not simply stick a Post-it note on a door somewhere and leave town, solely to gum up the government. Too many Republicans have done that during this president's time in office. He said that this is an important issue, and we should be talking about it more -- repeatedly, for 13 hours. That's not a stunt. That's the way the filibuster is supposed to work. If you want to see a stunt, pay more attention to the excessive abuse of the filibuster over the last four years. Fortunately, Attorney General Eric Holder sent Paul a commendable letter ruling out strikes on noncombatant Americans on U.S. soil. But at the end of the day, I still do not believe the American public has a clear understanding of the extent and limits of the drone program. For example, what about Americans overseas -- and what about the hundreds of innocent civilian lives lost to terrifying drone strikes around the world? Getting rid of unilateral kill lists will not elevate our moral position if we continue to be responsible for innocent deaths. In addition to the lives lost, we inflict tremendous trauma on children who witness these attacks, and unmeasurable psychological damage on parents who never know if this day will be their last. Decent and fair-minded Americans should focus not only on drones that target Americans, but also on drone strikes that shock our conscience. We need to have a national conversation, and that is what Paul started on Wednesday. No matter what you think of his other views, we can all agree that this conversation cannot end here. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Van Jones.","Van Jones: Rand Paul deserves credit for his filibuster on drone policy issues .
Jones says Paul spoke out against excessive executive power and for civil liberties .

"(CNN) -- Thirty-two years ago, President Ronald Reagan launched an era of anti-government politics with his first inaugural address. On Monday, President Barack Obama offered the best rebuttal to date. Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer said the speech marked ""the end of Reaganism,"" and I couldn't agree more. Like Reagan, the president sought to ground the national conversation in his own definition of patriotism. But instead of the ""liberty-only"" patriotism of Reagan and political descendants such as Paul Ryan, who would turn love of country into hate for its government and its people, Obama offered a deeper ""liberty and justice for all"" patriotism. Obama noted that the world has changed -- that global problems cause local disasters, and what happens across town affects you and your neighbors -- and he called on us all to realize that you cannot have liberty for all without justice for all. Opinion: World to Obama -- You can't ignore us . Perhaps most fittingly, on a day heavy with memory, the president invoked those who once stood on the National Mall to hear a different type of founding father -- ""a king (who proclaimed) that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth."" The overtones of Reagan's 1981 speech rang so loudly, in fact, that it's clear the president and his team looked to that address as inspiration. Reagan offered up a vision of an over-taxed, long-neglected ""We the People""; Obama's version of ""We the People"" is youthful, diverse, energetic and engaged. Both saw their addresses as a call to arms for all Americans. Both sought to tie the best traditions of our founding fathers to today's challenges. Both insisted that what truly drives America is the ingenuity and independence of our people. Opinion: Obama finally meets Machiavelli . But while Reagan advanced the simplistic idea that government and liberty are always at odds, Obama's speech reflected the realizations of a new century. Instead of ""government is the problem,"" the president reminded us that we could all fall victim to sudden misfortune. Instead of pinning blame for every social problem on the size of government, the president recognized both individual responsibility and the role of community in giving each child the opportunity to succeed. Like Reagan, the president invoked the names of famous places in American history -- but instead of battles, he tied Stonewall in with Selma and cemented his declaration that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights are civil rights. Coming off an election during which today's Reaganites insulted a nation of ""takers,"" the president declared that Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security ""free us to take the risks that make this country great."" Opinion: Obama's ringing defense of liberalism . This was not a partisan speech. It was not a campaign rally. But it showed that Obama will not back away from a fight. He is staking a bet that a rising generation has a new vision for the country. I do not think that following through will be easy, or that the president will do everything right. But he showed Monday that he is standing on the right side of history.

"(CNN) -- This is for those who stayed. For the ones who, regardless of the reason, never picked up and moved. This is for those who right now are right where they always have been. Who aren't going home for the holidays, because home is where they already are. This week the airports, highways, train stations and bus depots will be jammed. Americans, as they always are in the week leading up to Christmas, are on the move. Many are heading home. So this may be as good a time as any to reflect on what that word -- ""home"" -- means. When people eagerly head home for the holidays, what is their true destination? It isn't merely geographic. When you set foot again in the place you're from, it's not the street signs that warm you, or the sight of the public library or the town hall. Those are reminders, guideposts -- but that's not why you're there. Home feels the way it does because of the people who never left -- the people who, with gratitude, you can count on, the family and friends you're coming home to. Without them, it's just a dot on a map. They're the ones who are too often taken for granted. The ones who, in an era of constant transience and relentless motion, elected long ago, for their own good reasons, against being footloose. Who dropped anchor early, and stayed put while others were departing. Just how taken for granted are they? The U.S. Census Bureau, which keeps track of seemingly everything, doesn't keep track of them. Robert B. Bernstein, a Census official, told me that there are no figures available for the number of people who have stayed in the same town for their entire lives. But there are clues-- clues about the impulse for allegiance -- to be found in related census data that Bernstein and I delved into together. Fifty-nine percent of Americans live in the same state where they were born. Midwesterners are the most loyal to where they come from: 70.2 percent live in the state of their birth. The Western states manage to keep only 49.3 percent of those who were born there. If you live in Louisiana, you're among the 78.8 percent of .your fellow residents who were born there, the highest percentage in the U.S., followed by Michigan at 76.6 percent and Ohio at 75.1 percent. Nevada has the lowest percentage of people born there: 24.3, followed by Florida, next-lowest, with 35.2 percent and Arizona with 37.7 percent. Nationwide, according to the most recent census numbers available, 45.3 million people live in a different house from the one where they lived a year ago, and 6.7 million of them live in a different state. Perhaps the most beloved holiday movie is ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" in which George Bailey, played by Jimmy Stewart, is a man who never moved away from Bedford Falls, and who is not without occasional pangs of regret about it. Generations of audiences have silently cheered for him. But the Jimmy Stewart character had a motion-picture camera trained on him; in real life, the men and women who stay often do so with no audience to applaud their fidelity to place. We live in a society in which wanderlust is considered an unchallenged virtue. For generations, it has been said approvingly that someone has ""set off to make it big,"" has ""gone off to conquer the world."" Getting out, seeking fresh horizons, has been made a celebrated and acclaimed goal, seldom questioned. And those who stay behind? They do so for a variety of reasons: genuine love of a place; family obligations; a job that feels steady and safe. You sense, though, that some who stay may, like George Bailey, from time to time have second thoughts. Were they reluctant to roll the dice? Did an opportunity somewhere bigger and brighter open and then close before they worked up the resolve to say yes? Did they tell themselves that tomorrow they would make the grand move so many times that all the tomorrows finally ran out? Every person has his or her own answer. In these December weeks, in town after American town, people will come home for the holidays, and it will feel like home because of the faces that remain there, the voices that are so familiar. Do those who stay ever ask themselves whether they have missed out on something in the wider world beyond? Perhaps. Human nature dictates that we often fixate on the path not taken. But a town would not be a town were it not for those who vote in favor of it every day of their lives with their continued presence, who make it feel solid and permanent not just because they know the place so well, but because they know themselves just as well, and are confident enough in who they are that they don't necessarily have to look elsewhere for affirmation. The world changes and becomes barely recognizable; even the tiniest towns transform themselves over time. If you're heading home for the holidays this week, you may notice that the old movie theater is a coffee shop now, or that the pharmacy has become a bank branch. The sight of those faces, though, older but somehow forever young; the sound of those voices, voices you would know if you heard them anywhere on the planet, but that, now and always, are specific to this one and only place. . . This is a time, and a season, to be thankful for those voices. For those faces. For the ones who chose to stay. As the holidays arrive, you may be coming home. They -- in every way that counts -- are home. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene says people going home for the holidays look forward to familiar faces .

"(CNN) -- Our gun debate continues to revolve around measures to prevent deranged people from using military-style weapons to massacre innocent people. This is a worthy goal. We should do all we can do, within the limits of our Constitution, to reduce the number and deadliness of these tragedies. But I am increasingly concerned that the debate will never evolve to include deeper sources of gun violence in our country. After all, most people killed by guns in the United States are not killed in school massacres by villains carrying AR-15s. They are killed one at a time, and usually by handguns. All too often, they die in urban and rural communities in economic distress. More people die in gun suicides than gun murders. This is the real gun violence epidemic. And universal background checks -- as important and necessary as that step is -- will not do much to curb it. I had hoped the national debate might expand to include a deeper discussion of what is really happening with gun violence in America. So far, it has not. The conversation did not change much, even after Hadiya Pendleton, who marched with her Chicago classmates in President Obama's second inaugural parade, was shot and killed in a park while talking with her friends. She was only 15 years old. The truth is that her story is tragically common in America. And the most disputed ideas out of Washington, like an assault weapons ban, wouldn't do much to change that reality. Opinion: More gun mayhem, and yet we wait for action . What can be done to really reduce the senseless slaughter in schools like Sandy Hook and on the streets in cities like Chicago? Should we close the loophole that allows people to buy guns without a basic background check? Yes. Get illegal guns off the street? Yes. Ban assault weapons? Of course. These things should have been done years ago. For the decades of inaction, we can thank the National Rifle Association, a gun manufacturers' lobby that has divorced itself from reality. Should we put armed guards in every school? Probably not. More weapons do not necessarily make us safer. And the price for doing so might keep us from measures that are smarter and statistically more effective, like better mental health services and counseling for students on the edge. Proposals for ""armed schools"" may help the NRA sell more guns, but they don't address the underlying problems. They also risk leaving the rest of us in a perpetual high-fear, low-trust society. What could really turn the tide? Much of the daily violence is linked to economic desperation and despair. Areas of concentrated poverty continue to be linked to violent crime. In Chicago, the most poverty-stricken neighborhoods have the highest homicide rate. Studies by the Brookings Institution, Johns Hopkins, and even the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco note the link between lack of opportunity and violence. We should be focused on connecting people, especially young men, to training and employment. As I said recently on ""Piers Morgan Tonight,"" nothing stops a bullet like a job. As author and journalist Alex Kotlowitz told CNN, in violent Chicago neighborhoods, ""The American Dream is fiction."" NRA chief: Why we fight for gun rights . Fixing that by making sure every American has a chance to climb the ladder to opportunity is a good place to start. Beyond that, many community programs are having success at creating more peaceful streets. For example: in South Los Angeles, the Community Coalition has created a safer neighborhood by working with residents to shut down a troublesome liquor store and connecting families to jobs resources. The Harlem Children's Zone is a successful example of an Obama administration program, Promise Neighborhoods, that has received too little money and too little attention. Baltimore's Safe Streets program reduces gun violence by providing mediating services and resources for youth to participate in community service programs and job training. A University of Philadelphia study even found that greening vacant lots in cities helps reduce gun violence. These programs and the crying need for jobs should be at the center of any discussion about reducing the horrifying death toll in our nation. Every child dead is a massacre, whether it happens in unspeakable numbers in a schoolhouse or one by one on the streets of Chicago. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Van Jones.","Van Jones: Gun debate needs to go beyond background checks and assault weapons .

"(CNN) -- Florida authorities have delivered all evidence related to the George Zimmerman investigation to federal officials, who are weighing whether to pursue a civil rights case. The Sanford Police Department said it turned over all evidence, including a gun, to the Department of Justice on Monday. Justice officials are investigating whether Zimmerman violated Trayvon Martin's civil rights when he shot the African-American teenager. Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch volunteer, was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges on July 13 after claiming he fired in self-defense. The shooting occurred in February last year. Zimmerman helps family out of overturned SUV . Attorney General Eric Holder has said the Justice Department will ""act in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law."" Holder described Martin's shooting as "" tragic, unnecessary,"" and said a thorough investigation will be conducted. ""Independent of the legal determination that will be made, I believe that this tragedy provides yet another opportunity for our nation to speak honestly about the complicated and emotionally charged issues that this case has raised,"" Holder said last week. ""We must not -- as we have too often in the past -- let this opportunity pass."" Justice officials opened an investigation into the Zimmerman case last year and will include testimony from the Florida trial.

"(CNN) -- At his official post-election press conference, President Obama told reporters that he's serious about fighting climate change while creating jobs. ""We can shape an agenda that says we can create jobs, advance growth and make a serious dent in climate change and be an international leader,"" he said, ""I think that's something that the American people would support."" We have just the answer. It's not a new idea, but as the two parties face off over the federal budget, it could be the path forward. There's a tool we can use to answer the public's call for more jobs -- without cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security: a carbon tax. One analysis by the Congressional Budget Office says a moderate, $20-per-ton tax on carbon emissions could raise $1.25 trillion over 10 years. And the savings don't stop there. For decades, the oil and coal industries have passed along their costs to the rest of us, in the form of asthma treatment, emergency room visits, doctor bills and missed days of school and work. Combined with droughts, wildfires, hurricanes and severe weather events like Superstorm Sandy, rising levels of carbon in the atmosphere cost our nation an estimated $70 billion each year. That's real money. And unlike cutting Medicare and Social Security, a carbon tax is a political winner. A large and growing super-majority of Americans -- 70% -- believe climate change is a real problem. A Yale University national survey found overwhelming majorities in favor of bold action like a carbon tax. Even the far-right American Enterprise Institute has been willing to talk about the benefits of a carbon tax, and anti-tax activist Grover Norquist has flirted with the idea. Yes, polluters will fight a carbon tax tooth and nail, just like tobacco companies raged against cigarette taxes. But far from costing jobs, a carbon tax will provide a net benefit to our economy, especially if we start the carbon tax conversation by making sure miners and other coal industry workers -- the people who have sacrificed their lungs, and in some instances even their lives, so that we can keep the lights on -- are among the biggest winners. Experts anticipate that the $500 billion in scheduled federal budget cuts will cost us nearly one million jobs. The $1.25 trillion from a carbon tax would allow us to avoid these cuts with money to spare to pay down the deficit, and to maintain clean energy investments that create 3.2 times as many jobs per dollar than subsidies for fossil fuels. A carbon tax would also reduce barriers to market entry for clean-energy startups facing an entrenched fossil fuel industry. There are already 3.1 million green jobs in America -- imagine how many more there would be if we leveled the playing field instead of subsidizing oil and coal companies. Finally, one study by the Center for American Progress and the Political Economy Research institute found that we could create up to 1.7 million jobs simply by putting a price on carbon. The fact is, our economy will only be stronger and our communities healthier if we tax pollution instead of subsidizing it -- and invest in the new industries of tomorrow. A carbon tax is really that rarest of ideas, a win-win-win solution that solves multiple problems at once. Tax polluters so we can pay down our debt without slashing the safety net? Win. Spur investment in new technologies and spark the creation of clean-energy manufacturing jobs right here in America? Win. And take a long-overdue step toward solving the climate crisis that already costs so much, and will only get worse? Win. The question isn't whether this vision is right for America -- nearly everyone wants to breathe fresh air, drink clean water, bring home a decent paycheck and retire with security. The only question is if Washington has the courage to seize this opportunity. If they do, this moment won't be remembered as a drawn-out partisan showdown over spending, but as the launching pad from which we began to sail into a healthier, more prosperous future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.","Jones and Ellis-Lamkins: A tax on carbon emissions could raise $1.25 trillion over 10 years .

"(CNN) -- Over the years, it seems that just about every format imaginable has been used for debates between presidential candidates. Lecterns. Chairs. No chairs. Tables. No tables. Open stages to walk around on. Moderators working solo, like Jim Lehrer at this year's first presidential debate and Martha Raddatz at the vice presidential debate. Moderators with panels of reporters. Questions submitted by the audience. Questions submitted by viewers at home. Town halls, like the one that will be moderated by CNN's Candy Crowley on Tuesday. Yet, 52 years after the first televised presidential debate, there still often seems something stilted and dry about some of them (but not all: witness last week's high-energy vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan). Frequently, though, the staffs of the people running for the presidency negotiate the ground rules so fussily that the debates can at times feel like some sort of candidates' cotillion. So what if, for one debate some year, it was agreed to try the one format that has not been tested? The debate would still be 90 minutes in prime evening time. The proceedings would still be telecast live on all the networks. There would still be an audience in the auditorium. But there would be no moderator, and no panel of questioners. There would be no subject matter agreed to in advance. There would be no rules. None. At the top of the hour, the two candidates would come out onto the stage. There wouldn't even need to be an announcer making an introduction. And then. ... It would be up to them. They would have 90 minutes to talk to the audience, and to each other. To argue, and try to persuade, with no referee. It just might be fascinating. Their staffs, as campaign staffs will do, would have prepared them and would have come up with tactics for each of them to take over the debate. And you can bet that the two candidates would fall back on those rehearsed tactics. For about 15 minutes. But then they would realize that, with 75 or so minutes left, they had better figure out a way to talk about things with each other, and with the nation. It would be like when people get stuck in an elevator together: They talk because they have to. They may feel that they have nothing in common, but now they're here. In the elevator suspended between floors, there's no one but the two of them. Surprising things can be said and learned. There's no blueprint. No script. If a presidential debate of this sort were to be attempted, the audience in the auditorium, and at home, might find out some things about the candidates they would never discern in a tightly formatted, moderated debate, or in a standard-issue stump speech. And the candidates might find out a few things about each other -- maybe even find some unanticipated common ground. Funny things can happen in an elevator that isn't going anywhere. Some of what unfolds might have little to do with the specific words that are spoken. Is one of the candidates overbearing and selfish in how he uses the time -- does he refuse to let his opponent get a word in? That would be a good thing for the voters to know. Is one of the candidates lighthearted and easygoing as he deals with the empty minutes in the company of the person he is running against? That would be instructive to see. Who's the leader? Who heats up? Who is unflappable? There are, after all, occasions when presidents meet one-on-one with powerful foreign leaders, with no one to guide the conversation. This might be a good approximation of that -- presidential candidates unplugged, on their own, with no escape hatch. (Or the debate might instead turn out to be an approximation of a pro-wrestling cage match, in suits and ties instead of trunks.) Of course, once candidates took part in one debate with this format, they and their staffs would undoubtedly devise a way to screw it up for the next time, to make it bland and suck all the life out of it. But for one night -- that first night it was tried -- it just might make for great, riveting viewing. Or -- let's be candid -- it might turn out to be an utter flop, like the announcerless National Football League telecast that took place in 1980, when NBC Sports, as an experiment, put on a regular-season game between the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins with no announcers or commentators -- just the sights and sounds of the action. The post-game consensus was that it wasn't such a splendid idea at all. But two candidates, stuck in the presidential-debate elevator, depending on their own wits, intelligence and deeply held beliefs to carry the night? With just the two of them to figure it all out, and the entire nation watching? There is at least a chance that it could develop into one of the most spontaneous and illuminating evenings of politics ever televised. There's only one way to find out.

"San Diego (CNN) -- Welcome to the chaotic Department of Homeland Security. Two unions -- representing nearly 20,000 DHS employees -- recently joined forces to publicly oppose the Senate immigration reform bill from the so-called ""Gang of Eight."" News: Senate Judiciary Committee approves immigration legislation . The coalition represents 12,000 employees who are responsible for issuing documents that allow some immigrants to legally stay in the United States and 7,700 agents charged with deporting illegal immigrants out of the country. Together, the unions claim that the bill would weaken public safety. What makes this situation awkward is that President Barack Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano have given tacit support to the Senate immigration reform bill. Obama has said that a pathway to citizenship must be included in any reform proposal. And as recently as last month, White House press secretary Jay Carney said that White House staffers had months ago huddled with the eight senators to help draft the legislation. As an additional wrinkle, many of these DHS employees who oppose the bill would be charged with helping to implement it, either by reviewing the applications of undocumented immigrants who would be seeking legal status or deporting those who didn't qualify for it. How that will ultimately work out is anyone's guess. Some of this sounds familiar. Before the unions took on the Senate bill, they launched a rebellion closer to home. In June 2011, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton fired off an internal memorandum -- the ""Morton memo,"" as it became known -- to all directors, agents and general counsel in the agency's field offices. In the memo, Morton advised the field personnel that they ""may"" exercise discretion and show leniency toward some illegal immigrants by weighing certain factors. They included the length of time the person had lived in the United States, whether the person arrived as a child, whether the person was pursuing an education, etc. The Morton memo was heralded by immigration reform advocates as a major breakthrough. And yet, how did some in the field respond to the memo? According to more than a dozen immigration attorneys I interviewed back then and many others I saw quoted elsewhere, they ignored it. You had rampant insubordination. And neither Morton nor his higher-ups, i.e. Napolitano and Obama, did anything to bring people back in line. I suspect that the reason for this hands-off approach was that the ICE agents, by racking up deportations, were helping the administration meet its goal of deporting people -- which it has done at a rate of more than 1,000 per day. The high numbers were necessary so that the administration could portray itself to Congress and the American people as tough on immigration enforcement. In October 2011, just four months after the Morton memo was issued, Napolitano delivered a speech at American University in which she boasted that the Department of Homeland Security was on track to set a new record for deportations in the 2011 fiscal year. It did. And in fiscal 2012, it broke that record again. At this rate, by the end of 2013, the administration will have deported 2 million people. Those figures make the claims of Chris Crane, the head of the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council (the 7,700-member deportation agents' union), all the more ridiculous. Crane told the New York Times: ""This department under this administration is doing anything and everything they can not to arrest any alien in the interior of the United States."" Crane should tell that to 10-year-old Stephanie Pucheta who, next month, will be spending Father's Day without her father, Julio Cesar Pucheta, who was deported in January. In a video testimonial on behalf of the immigrant advocacy group Cuentame, the U.S.-born Stephanie explains how -- when a judge ordered her father removed from the country -- she couldn't stop crying. She goes on to say: ""My life has changed without my father. Since he's been gone, I miss him every day. Every morning when I wake up, I wonder why they didn't let him stay here. Why do they have to be so cruel to the families that are here?"" That's a really good question. This administration has been excessively cruel to illegal immigrants and their families. And, worse, it hasn't been willing to confess to the crime. Instead, it has led us to believe that its record number of deportations are partly the result of low-level agents and their supervisors going rogue and refusing to use discretion to the point where some of those being deported shouldn't be. Is that really what's happening? Napolitano has said all along she wants to remove illegal immigrants, more and more every year. That's what the low-level ICE agents were doing. So maybe they weren't being disobedient. Maybe, in trying to be both tough and compassionate, the entire administration is being duplicitous. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Two DHS unions now publicly oppose proposed immigration reform .

"(CNN) -- Some in the pro-immigrant left are confused. They can't make up their minds about U.S. citizenship. Is it a necessity or a luxury? Is it vitally important to living a full life or something one can live without? Should it be respected and treasured or rejected and trivialized? Don't expect California to be of much help in sorting this out. In making public policy, especially on the tough issues, my home state can often be emotional, egotistical and erratic. Just last week, the state Assembly approved AB 1401, a bill that would allow noncitizens to serve on juries if they are in the country legally. The vote, 45 to 26, wasn't even close. All the ""yes"" votes came from Democrats. No surprise there. Getting noncitizens on juries is the first step toward what Democrats are really after -- getting more of them to vote, at least in non-federal elections. In November 2010, voters in San Francisco weighed in on a proposition that would have allowed all parents of children in the city's schools to vote in school board elections whether they were citizens or not; they voted it down but the shocking part is that it was even proposed. Still, if the bill is approved by the state Senate and signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, California would become the first state in the nation to dispense with the citizenship requirement to sit on a jury. What's wrong with this picture? What happened to all the rhetoric we've heard in the debate over comprehensive immigration reform, about how advocates won't settle for the undocumented getting only legal status because ""citizenship"" is so wonderful and valuable? Just not essential to acts of civic participation like sitting on juries. Supporters say they want to increase the size of the available jury pool while helping immigrants integrate into U.S. society. They also claim that juries should reflect their communities as they exist, and this means including noncitizens in the mix. Those are lovely sentiments. But if people want to help immigrants ""integrate,"" they should help them become U.S. citizens. It's not that difficult. The hard part is going from ""illegal immigrant"" to ""legal resident""; by comparison, transitioning from ""legal resident"" to ""U.S. citizen"" is a walk in the park. In fact, often times, according to immigration attorneys and other experts in the field, the only reason that more people don't complete the process and become citizens is because they're reluctant to let go of their romantic attachment to their homeland. Immigration is a complicated issue that has baffled the Golden State for more than 25 years. In effect, there are two signs on the California-Mexico border, about 10 miles south of San Diego: ""No Trespassing"" and ""Help Wanted."" Half the time, we're trying to get rid of immigrants; the other half, we're trying to get our hands on more. Our elected officials only add to the confusion. With one hand, Brown signed legislation letting undocumented college students apply for state-sponsored financial aid. With the other, he vetoed a bill that would have scaled back the cooperation that local police give to U.S. immigration officials in rounding up immigrants who are here illegally. So, in Brown's California, local cops can help hunt you down if you lack legal status. But, if you get by them, you can go to college on the taxpayer's dime? We've seen this kind of inconsistency before. In 1986, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson helped push the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which legalized more than 3 million illegal immigrants. The Republican did it to please his benefactors in agriculture, who understand that they would be out of business without the undocumented. In 1994, Wilson -- who was by then California governor, and fighting for re-election -- turned himself inside out and hitched his wagon to Proposition 187, an insanely cruel ballot initiative that intended to deny illegal immigrants and their children access to public schools, welfare benefits and nonemergency health care. It was that Republican-backed initiative, which was later struck down by the federal courts as unconstitutional, that sent California into a political tailspin. In a state that is more than 38% Latino, and where Latinos account for more than one in five voters, the GOP's war on immigrants turned out to be a suicide mission. Thanks in large part to support from Latino voters, Democrats now have ""supermajorities"" in both chambers of the state legislature. This means they get bills passed without a single Republican vote. Think about the consequences. Noncitizens serving on juries. Who could have imagined? Welcome to life on the Left Coast. This is how California rolls. It acts on impulse and out of a misplaced sense of social justice. It makes mistakes that take years to rectify. Its ""can-do"" spirit convinces it that it can do great things. But it never stops to ask whether it might instead do great harm. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","A bill passed by Calif. assembly would let noncitizens serve on juries .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- The Supreme Court just did Latinos and African-Americans a big favor. It showed the two minority groups most impacted by affirmative action the writing on the wall and prodded them to end their crippling dependence on a program that, while intended to help them when it was designed a half-century ago, now arguably does them harm. On the surface, with its lopsided 7-to-1 ruling in Fisher v. The University of Texas, the Supreme Court resolved to do not that much. The justices ducked the weightier constitutional concerns involved in the issue of whether colleges and universities can take an applicant's race or ethnicity into account. But they did scold the lower courts for their handling of the case and demand that they give the facts and the law another look. Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy pointed out that the Supreme Court had previously set a standard of ""strict scrutiny"" -- by which the burden lies on institutions of higher learning to show that they couldn't have gotten where they wanted to go in terms of achieving a diverse student body by using ""race-neutral alternatives."" The lower courts didn't hold the University of Texas at Austin to that standard, Kennedy said, and so they need a do-over. The court's four most conservative justices agreed with Kennedy, but so did Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, who are more liberal. Let's give the majority of the justices some credit for not getting too carried way with the notion of victimhood. They could have suggested, along with Justice Clarence Thomas, that Abigail Fisher -- the onetime applicant to the University of Texas at Austin who was at the center of the case -- is the modern-day equivalent of those African-Americans who, in the pre-civil rights era, were routinely discriminated against and denied admission to colleges and universities because of their race. Thomas essentially compared what the University of Texas at Austin does now to what the University of Mississippi was doing in 1963. Seriously? Here's what really happened in the Lone Star State. When Fisher applied in 2008, the university set aside three-fourths of its available slots to students who graduated in the top 10% of their high school classes. (Today, it's 8%.) Fisher's academics weren't strong enough to get her into that category; she graduated in the top 12%. And rather than admit that she should have earned better grades, she got angry with the university which doled out other slots under a process that weighed several factors including race and socioeconomic status. After all, a diverse state deserves a diverse class of leaders. Texas is 12% African-American and 38% Latino while the student body at UT Austin -- with its 52,000 students -- is just 4.5% African-American and 18% Latino. Curiously, Fisher blamed the university's policy -- rather than her own academic shortcomings -- for not getting into the University of Texas. And then, she filed a lawsuit. She found her way to Louisiana State University, and the case bearing her name quickly found its way to the Supreme Court, where it was welcomed onto the docket by five justices who were already itching to strike down affirmative action. Despite what Justice Thomas would like to believe, Fisher is no victim. Had she worked a little harder in high school, she might have gotten into college on ""the 10% rule"" and saved us all a lot of drama. Besides, aren't conservatives the ones who are always talking about merit? Yet, here they went to bat for mediocrity. It is simply not the case that white people are -- in the admissions process -- being subjected to some wholesale form of discrimination because they have long been considered inferior due to skin color. They don't need to link arms and sing: ""We Shall Overcome."" Now, if you want to see real victims, look at African-American and Latino students who are being shortchanged by the public school system because those who teach them harbor low expectations. This is one of the most serious problems with racial and ethnic preferences -- that they camouflage what are often severe educational inequalities at the critical K-12 level. They can also lower standards, kill incentive, provide a crutch, attach a stigma to beneficiaries, and perpetuate a destructive spoils system that benefits a few at the expense of the many. These programs should have come with an expiration date. It's been more than 50 years since President John F. Kennedy signed -- on March 6, 1961 -- Executive Order 10925, instructing U.S. government contractors to take ""affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin."" My parents' generation suffered real discrimination, and so it made sense to give it a leg up through affirmative action. But it makes no sense to transfer that privilege to my children, who are being raised with every advantage. When that sort of thing happens, it only makes the public more cynical and bitter. The Supreme Court gave affirmative action in college and university admissions a reprieve this week, but it won't last long. The justices have another case on their docket for the fall. The hour is late. Latinos and African-Americans have the chance to end their dependence on a program that is taking them nowhere, and the rest of us can focus on fixing a broken educational system so that more students of color can succeed on the natural and go anywhere they want to go.

"(CNN) -- ""Government should be transparent. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing. ... My Administration will take appropriate action, consistent with law and policy, to disclose information rapidly in forms that the public can readily find and use."" -- President Barack Obama, memo to heads of executive departments and agencies, 2009 . ""The basis of our governments being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter."" --Thomas Jefferson to Lt. Col. Edward Carrington, Continental Army, 1787 . Journalists are hardwired to be pro-transparency, pro-leaks and pro-whistleblower. They're not supposed to cozy up to the powerful; they're supposed to confront them. Their job isn't just to comfort the afflicted, but also to afflict the comfortable. And above all, the media have a sacred duty to act as a watchdog against the excesses of government. And if there is one thing that the Obama administration finds itself with an ""excess"" of at this point -- a little more than 100 days into its second term -- it's government excess. This White House has been horrible at transparency. In 2010, in more than a third of the requests for public records, the Obama administration didn't provide any information. In fact, the administration has released fewer records under the Freedom of Information Act than were released during the George W. Bush administration. And in the case of ""Fast and Furious,"" where U.S. law enforcement agents allowed illegal guns into Mexico so they could track them -- and then lost track of them -- we're no closer to knowing the truth about who was responsible. Attorney General Eric Holder was held in contempt of Congress during a dispute over requested documents and President Obama went so far as to invoke executive privilege to keep from releasing those same documents. The administration knows all about secrecy. Nonetheless, these days, you need a program to keep straight all the scandals of officials in the executive branch secretly doing things they're not supposed to be doing. The Justice Department is investigating the Internal Revenue Service for unfairly scrutinizing conservative groups thought to be aligned with the tea party. And so who will investigate the Justice Department for spying on The Associated Press? The IRS should do it. Just to keep things even. Welcome to the Obama administration's chaotic version of the second-term curse, where the common theme is government officials, either with or without the blessings of higher-ups, abusing their power. The Associated Press revealed this week that the Justice Department, in April and May 2012, used subpoenas to secretly help itself to two months' worth of phone records from journalists. Those targeted included at least five reporters, an editor and AP Washington bureau chief Sally Buzbee. The Justice Department was interested in the conversations of anyone who worked on a May 7, 2012, story about the CIA thwarting a terrorist plot in Yemen. The administration wanted to know who was leaking information to the AP, so rather than monitor the phone lines of its own employees, it monitored the phone lines of the journalists who might be receiving that information. According to the news agency, 20 different phone lines were tapped, including not just work phones and the AP's main switchboard, but also the journalists' home and cell phones. In all, according to the AP, when you count all the people who came in contact with the phones in question, more than 100 journalists could have been affected. Is it cold in here? I just felt a chill down my spine. It is all part of the government's aggressive crackdown on leaks to the media. The Obama administration has prosecuted six leak-related cases. That's more than all previous administrations combined. On Monday, AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt fired off a letter to Holder condemning this ""massive and unprecedented intrusion"" into the agency's reporting. Pruitt wants the Justice Department to return the phone records and destroy any copies. That would the smart thing to do. I've known Pruitt for more than 20 years, since he was a young publisher of my hometown newspaper in central California, The Fresno Bee. He's a smart and tough newspaperman who originally came into this business as a media lawyer. He won't be intimidated, and he won't let this go. When the government counterpunches, Pruitt will hit back even harder. The counterpunching has already begun. On Tuesday, Deputy Attorney General James Cole sent a letter to Pruitt defending the decision to grab the phone records. Cole insisted that the subpoenas were ""drawn as narrowly as possible"" and aimed at collecting ""limited subject matter."" Not good enough, said Pruitt in a quick response. Saying that Cole's letter did not ""adequately address our concerns,"" Pruitt questioned how such a sweeping investigation could be called ""narrowly drawn."" My friend is right on the money, and he's right to raise a ruckus. A line has been crossed here. Every journalist in America ought to be outraged by the hubris of this administration, as should every American who believes -- along with Thomas Jefferson -- that the press has a solemn duty to inform the public as to what government is doing in its name. And it's hard for the media to keep tabs on the government when the government is busy keeping tabs on the media.

"(CNN) -- I bet that Paul Ryan is not typically serenaded by mariachis. But then, this week was anything but typical for the Republican congressman from Wisconsin. Ryan traveled to Chicago--and across the aisle--to appear alongside Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, perhaps Congress' most vocal proponent of immigration reform. The two men gave a joint presentation at the City Club of Chicago, where -- even in that bluest of blue cities -- the business friendly audience probably favors many of Ryan's economic policies. Before that, the two lawmakers went into a Hispanic neighborhood to meet with activists, members of the clergy and immigrant advocates. It was there that the mariachis greeted them. In the crowd, a man appreciatively held up a banner with Ryan's photo on it and the words: ""Gracias, Ryan."" For immigration reform advocates, there is a lot for which to be thankful these days. At a time when more and more Republicans in Congress are expressing skepticism about a Senate bill that combines border security with a guest worker program and legal status for the undocumented, Ryan is doubling down on his support. He thinks the current system is failing us. He told the crowd that what we're doing now is bad for national security, bad for business, bad for communities and bad for families. Right you are, congressman. On all counts. During the visit, Ryan told reporters: ""I would say for the sake of our national security, we want to modernize our immigration laws. We do not even know how to track people who overstay their visas. We need a modern immigration system that helps us not only protect our border but protects national security in all of its aspects. So if anything, I would say this is an argument for modernizing our immigration laws. We need it for national security, we need it for our economy."" And when Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, talks about the economy, he is on familiar terrain. ""If you take a look at contributions that immigrants make to society ... it produces faster economic growth, which brings in more revenue to the federal government,"" he said. ""So if you look at this issue in its totality, immigration is a net positive contributor to the economy."" The congressman also knows his way around the immigration issue. In 2005, as Gutierrez reminded the crowd, Ryan co-sponsored an immigration reform bill in the House that was ultimately voted down. He has said he is especially concerned that employers, including the kinds of farmers and ranchers who populate his home state, have access to the labor they need to stay in business. In fact, over the last decade, Ryan has supported or co-sponsored what the anti-immigrant group, NUMBERS USA, disdainfully called ""various amnesties to give illegal aliens a path to citizenship."" It's one reason that the group -- which advocates both an end to illegal immigration and a dramatic reduction in legal immigration, to pre-1965 levels -- gave Ryan's career in Congress a ""C."" That grade puts him in the bottom 10% of all current Republican members of Congress, according to the group's executive director, Roy Beck. And, conversely, it puts him in the top 10%, as far as many Latinos are concerned. You see, it only helps build Ryan's ""street cred"" that he's not popular with groups that attract so many anti-Latino nativists. The 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee is almost certain to run for the top job in 2016 as part of what could turn out to be a crowded field. Other contenders for the Republican presidential nomination could include Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. With that kind of lineup, you can expect immigration to be a top issue in the GOP primary. Rubio is the de facto spokesman for the 844-page comprehensive immigration reform bill cobbled together by the Senate's ""gang of eight."" Cruz is a vocal critic of the plan. Lately, Jeb Bush seems to have cornered the market on just about every position imaginable on a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Ryan needs to get his ducks in a row. Was this week's trip to Chicago the kick-off of his 2016 Hispanic outreach efforts? If so, will it work? It could, if it is followed up by other visits and more speeches and continued attention to Latino concerns. It's a start. If Ryan talks less, and listens more, he'll stand out from other politicians and could impress Latino voters as someone whose interests, on some issues, align with theirs. The GOP is doing a lot of soul-searching these days trying to figure out how to get Latinos to show them some love. There are strategy sessions and focus groups and smarty-pants consultants with their pie charts and bar graphs. But folks make this stuff harder than it really is. In the world of Latino outreach, sometimes, it's the little things that count for a lot. Like a Republican congressman from Wisconsin taking an unexpected detour to say his piece and pay his respects to a constituency poorly served by both parties, despite the likelihood that he'll be hammered by some in his own party. Like the man said -- Gracias, Ryan. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: In Chicago visit, Rep.

"(CNN) -- Does your company have in place what amounts to an ""English-only"" policy for employees? Yes? No? How do we get Whole Foods to tell the whole truth? At the very least, what we have at the trendy organic supermarket chain is a failure to communicate -- in any language. Bryan Baldizan and Lupe Gonzales -- two employees of a Whole Foods Market in Albuquerque, New Mexico -- say that they were suspended for speaking Spanish on the job and complaining to a manager who told them, in a staff meeting, that a company policy required them to speak English. Who would have thought? Hispanics make up a staggering 46.7% of New Mexico's population, and many of those folks have roots that run deep in the Land of Enchantment. New Mexicans do not play games when it comes to preserving language and culture. They take their right to speak Spanish seriously. New Mexico's state constitution does not declare an official language, and it protects Spanish and American Indian languages. So you can't have English-only policies there. But not everyone sees eye to eye. Remember that flap in October 2009 when Larry Whitten -- an innkeeper in Taos, New Mexico -- got in hot ""agua"" after firing some of his employees for speaking Spanish and refusing to Anglicize their names. You know, ""Juan"" to ""John,"" ""Maria"" to ""Mary"" etc. Whitten, a Texas transplant, claimed he was only thinking about his customer. But a lot of New Mexicans thought he wasn't thinking at all. Now, Baldizan and Gonzales got in trouble. Granted, their suspension at Whole Foods only lasted a day, and it was with pay. So the individual employees didn't suffer much harm. But there are those who believe that the cultural traditions of the state of New Mexico took a slap in the face. This isn't the end of this. Not even close. How did the company respond? Take your pick. It's multiple choice. At first, Whole Foods spokeswoman Libba Letton told the Associated Press that the employees misunderstood the reason they were disciplined and that they were actually suspended for being ""rude and disrespectful."" In the context of employees talking to their boss, it's pretty clear that what she really meant to say was that they were ""insubordinate."" Letton also told AP that the employees were never told they couldn't speak Spanish, and that there is no policy in place at the company that prohibits people from speaking a foreign language. But the issue is not whether the company prohibits the speaking of a foreign language, but whether it requires the speaking of English. Maybe it's just semantics, or maybe it's more than semantics. Besides, it doesn't look like Letton -- who is based in Austin -- was up to speed on what was happening on the ground in Albuquerque. Ben Friedland, executive marketing coordinator for Whole Foods Market Rocky Mountain Region, issued a statement acknowledging that the company believes that ""having a uniform form of communication is essential to a safe and efficient working environment."" Therefore, the statement said, ""our policy states that all English speaking Team Members must speak English to customers and other Team Members while on the clock."" ""Must speak,"" eh? Sounds like an English-only policy to me. It went on: ""Team Members are free to speak any language they would like during their breaks, meal periods and before and after work."" Wow. Whole Foods gives you permission to speak Spanish with family members at home before leaving for work. That's big of them. And what if a Spanish-speaking customer wants to come in and pay too much for an organic apple? They thought of that, too. The statement continues: ""Additionally, this policy does not apply to conversations among Team Members and customers if all parties present agree that a different language is their preferred form of communication."" Then, of course, there was the PR sprinkled with PC. ""At Whole Foods Market, we take pride in the diversity of our Team Member and customer base. We recognize with this diversity comes the challenge of different languages spoken."" See, there's the problem right there. The fact that an employee speaks more than one language isn't a challenge to be overcome. It's a valuable asset that provides one's company with limitless opportunities. And, after all that effort and all those words, the folks responsible for communicating for Whole Foods still weren't sure they were communicating well enough. So Letton circled back around and tried to edit Friedland's statement, telling USA Today in an e-mail that saying employees ""must speak English"" was ""an overstatement."" The final word is that the company now says that it would review the policy. You know, the one that it supposedly didn't have 10 minutes ago. And these are the folks who want us all to speak proper English so we can get our point across? They need to go first. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Two Whole Foods workers in New Mexico say they spoke Spanish, got suspended .

"(CNN) -- In a recent interview on Ketchikan Public Radio in Alaska, Rep. Don Young, the state's only congressman, offered this unhelpful tidbit: . ""My father had a ranch; we used to have 50-60 wet---- to pick tomatoes. It takes two people to pick the same tomatoes now. It's all done by machine."" There it is -- the equivalent of what Groucho Marx used to call ""the secret word."" It's a word that is so offensive that I won't say or write it in the long form -- although many people do so freely, which is a problem. Just as Americans have been conditioned to refer to the ""n-word"" as a sanitized alternative to the filthy and hurtful long-form version, so we too should start referring to the ""w-word"" when describing that ethnic slur used to describe Mexican immigrants who came here, shall we say, without proper documents. I started this crusade in April 2007 with a column for CNN.com. In it, I pointed out that the w-word is used with reckless abandon by right-wing cable talk show hosts but also left-wing journalists and celebrities. I couldn't imagine these folks using the long form of the n-word even if they were merely repeating what someone else had said. Yet they did not hesitate to use the w-word. This tells us at least two things. One, for many Americans, the w-word isn't as ugly or offensive as the n-word. And two, in the minds of the uninformed, Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in the Southwest don't have the same legacy of racism, discrimination and mistreatment that affected African-Americans. The experiences aren't identical, of course. But given that Mexicans in states such as California, Arizona and Texas endured Jim Crow-style segregation, job discrimination, inferior public schools, lynchings and hate crimes and repression by racist law enforcement organizations, there are similarities. Liberals couldn't wait to pounce on Young's remarks, spreading the word (literally) and making sure the media knew that -- gasp! -- a Republican congressman had referred to Mexican immigrants using the w-word. For Democrats, who are used to getting Hispanic votes without having to earn them and want to keep it that way by pointing out how bad Republicans are, it was like Christmas in springtime. It didn't help the GOP that Young was clueless about what he done wrong. After the first round of criticism, the lawmaker tried to brush off the controversy by saying only that he had ""used a term that was commonly used during my days growing up on a farm in Central California"" and that he ""meant no disrespect."" That's funny. I grew up around farms in Central California. And, I can tell you, that term is all about disrespect. After fellow Republicans blasted Young for his comments and demanded that he apologize, the congressman swallowed his pride. In a statement, Young wrote: ""I apologize for the insensitive term I used during an interview in Ketchikan, Alaska. There was no malice in my heart or intent to offend; it was a poor choice of words. That word, and the negative attitudes that come with it, should be left in the 20th century, and I'm sorry that this has shifted our focus away from comprehensive immigration reform."" If Young's comments did shift the focus, it wasn't for long. Over the weekend, business groups and organized labor signaled a major breakthrough on the road to comprehensive immigration reform when they announced they had finally struck a deal on guest worker visas, a major obstacle. All that remains now is for the Senate's ""Gang of Eight"" to unveil their bipartisan legislation by their April 8 deadline. I'm glad to see Republicans jumped on Young for his comments. But where is this outrage when other GOP lawmakers flirt with ethnic demagoguery? And what about Democrats? They were in such a hurry to condemn Young for using the w-word that they missed the fact that they were repeating the word over and over again, which suggests either that they're tone deaf or that they weren't as offended as they pretended to be. What we learn is that while leadership on matters of race and ethnicity is hard to find in either party, political opportunism is alive and well. Let's face it. Americans are not good when it comes to condemning the loaded language of race and ethnicity. We're not careful. We're not consistent. And we're not sincere. It's part of an overall breakdown in civility in our society and how dismissive we have become of anyone who raises concern. We're too mean, too childish, too petty and too personal. Just look at the shameful way that MSNBC commentator Toure Neblett recently lit into Dr. Ben Carson, a pediatric neurosurgeon and black conservative who has been critical of President Barack Obama. Toure all but called Carson an Uncle Tom, insisting that this accomplished individual who spoke his mind was Republicans' token ""black friend"" because he helps white people ""assuage their guilt."" It's never a good idea for one person of color to assess the authenticity of another -- especially if it's just for ratings. Carson likewise stepped in it when he offered his opinion on gay marriage by drawing comparisons that were harsh and inappropriate. During a recent interview on Fox News Channel, he said this: ""Well, my thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman. It's a well-established, fundamental pillar of society and no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality. It doesn't matter what they are. They don't get to change the definition."" Insisting that marriage be defined in a certain way is fine. Equating same-sex marriage with behavior that society has declared deviant and criminal is not. It turns out that elected officials aren't the only ones who sometimes cross the line with their words and should apologize for it.

"(CNN) -- The scoreboard was clear. Winner: 11-year-old Sebastien De La Cruz, ""El Charro de Oro"" (the golden horseman) who became a national story after he sang the national anthem at Game 3 of the NBA playoff series between the San Antonio Spurs and Miami Heat and showed a lot of a talent, heart and class. Losers: The haters and racists who -- displaying a lot of ignorance -- hid behind the anonymity of Twitter to spew venom and attack the little guy because they thought that no one dressed in a mariachi outfit was certified American enough to sing ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Here's a sample: . ""This lil Mexican snuck in the country like 4 hours ago now he's singing the anthem"" -- Francois@A2daO . ""Who dat lil #Wetback sangin the national anthem at the #Heat game????"" -- TJ THA DJ@Tj_Tha_Dj .

Get this lil kid out of here"" -- StevenDavid@A1R_STEVEN . ""So illegal aliens can sing The National Anthem @ games now?"" -- Mr.CheckYaDm@DJ_BMONEY . What does it mean to be an American anyway? Here's a quiz: . On one hand, you have someone who goes before a national audience and shows his love for a country where dreams come true. On the other, you have an angry mob filled with hatred and racism that, cloaked in the anonymity of Twitter, spews invective at a child. Now, which do you think represents what it means to be an American? Who do you want to claim? And who would you send packing? The United States looks out for the powerless, the downtrodden and the oppressed. Our system of government --- a constitutional republic -- protects the minority because majorities can protect themselves. Meanwhile, De La Cruz took the high road. Boy returns for NBA encore in mariachi suit . ""For those that said something bad about me, I understand it's your opinion,"" Sebastien told CNN. ""I'm a proud American and live in a free country. It's not hurting me. It's just your opinion."" Later, he discussed the backlash with reporters. ""To be honest,"" he said, ""It's just the people how they were raised. My father and my mother told me that you should never judge people by how they look. You should judge them on the inside. And the saying that I go by is never judge a book by its cover."" I don't have that kind of self-restraint. When I hear stories like this, I get sad. Then, I get enraged. I mean, enough is enough! De La Cruz is a Mexican-American born in San Antonio. That means he is part of a community that has -- since Manifest Destiny, the U.S.-Mexican War and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 -- put up with more than 100 years of discrimination and mistreatment at the hands of those who consider themselves superior. Even if, as the racist tweets show, they don't always act in ways that convey this alleged sense of superiority. The part about De La Cruz being Mexican-American, as opposed to a Mexican immigrant, is essential to the story. It's a complicated road. ""They don't know my life,"" he told reporters about his tormentors. ""My father was actually in the Navy for a really long time...People don't know, they just assume that I'm just Mexican. But I'm not from Mexico. I'm from San Antonio born and raised, a true San Antonio Spurs fan."" When De La Cruz did an interview with Univision, the Spanish-language network, he did it in English. And this is what the nativists were worried about -- that Mexican-Americans are not assimilating? The next chapter will be where some Mexican-Americans actually turn on De La Cruz for appearing to distance himself from Mexico. If they do, they'll look as silly as the nativists. The ""distance"" is already there. He's not a Mexican. He's a Mexican-American. There is a difference. Finally, thanks to the San Antonio Spurs -- and especially some good people in the front office -- a story that had many Latinos, and other Americans, seething had a Hollywood ending. De La Cruz was invited back to perform an encore of the national anthem at Game 4. Flanked by San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, and his wife Erica -- the boy returned to center stage and belted out an even stronger performance the second time around. I bet there wasn't a dry eye in the arena. As for the haters, they did what bullies usually do when someone stands up to them. They ran and hid, disabling their Twitter accounts or deleting their comments. For De La Cruz, who was aware of the comments and the controversy but managed to stay above it, the call-back wasn't political but personal. ""To be invited back to sing the national anthem is just amazing because now I know the San Antonio Spurs like how I sing,"" Sebastien said. ""It makes me feel like I'm doing something legendary."" The rest of us know that the encore was about more than the boy's talent. This was a message. The San Antonio Spurs is a classy outfit that boldly took a stand against bigotry and ignorance. Naturally. It was the American thing to do.

"(CNN) -- All those who are hoping that comprehensive immigration reform is going to happen this year -- Latinos, businesses, churches, agriculture industry, law enforcement and others -- are in for a rude awakening. The trick for politicians will be to look as if they're doing something, when really they're doing nothing. But, regardless of how it looks, it's a long shot that Congress will pass immigration reform this year. That's bad news for those who want to give the undocumented a chance to get right with the law and develop a sensible, fair and efficient policy for future immigrants. But it's good news for those who resist legalizing the undocumented because they're afraid of foreigners -- either because of competition with their work ethic, or that they're changing the culture and complexion of the country. Is enforcement key to fixing America's immigration system? The problem isn't just Republicans, who can't get on the same page about whether they want to be reformers. It's also Democrats, who seem to be playing the immigration reform camp for chumps. The signs are everywhere, if you know where to look. For instance, a few days ago, a draft of President Obama's immigration reform plan was leaked. It took four years to write, and yet its key points fit on a cocktail napkin with room to spare. Here's what is in the plan: more border security, a requirement that employers use an electronic system to verify if prospective hires are eligible to work, and a long path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. How long? The undocumented could immediately apply for a special protective status to avoid deportation, but it would take them about eight years to get legal permanent residency (a green card) and another four or five years to become a U.S. citizen. Here's what is not in the plan: a guest worker program. Republicans have repeatedly insisted that this needs to be in the mix for them to vote for any reform package. The fact that it was left out tells us that Obama isn't serious about reform and ensures that his plan would be, as Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said, ""dead on arrival"" in Congress. Opinion: Economy and immigration linked to American dream . The idea would be to bring in a few hundred thousand temporary ""guest workers"" to do the hard and dirty jobs that Americans won't do at any wage. When the work is done, and the workers have been paid a fair salary, they go home. And another batch is brought in. It's not a perfect solution. But you won't find any of those in the immigration debate. The first U.S. president to push for guest workers was Abraham Lincoln. Industries were facing labor shortages during the Civil War and, with Lincoln's support, Congress in 1864 passed The Act to Encourage Immigration. The bill allowed employers to recruit foreign workers and pay their way to America. There were more guest workers during World War I. But the concept really became popular during World War II and the Cold War. From 1942 to 1964, under the Bracero program (as in ""brazo"", which is Spanish for arm as in someone who works with his arms and hands), nearly 5 million guest workers came in and out of the United States. In fact, arguably, the reason the Braceros stopped coming was because journalist Edward R. Murrow -- in the 1960 CBS documentary, ""Harvest of Shame"" -- exposed the horrible treatments the workers received at the hands of employers, including low wages, unsanitary conditions, dilapidated housing, etc. Congress pulled the plug soon thereafter. But exploitation doesn't have to be part of the deal, and not every guest worker program is run as badly as that one. There are apple growers in Washington State who don't have to scramble for pickers at harvest time because the same crews return every year. The growers lure them back by paying decent wages and providing clean living quarters. Everyone is happy. Well, maybe not everyone. Many in organized labor hate the concept of guest workers because their leaders are busy peddling the fantasy that the hard and dirty jobs in question are sought after by union members. Sure. Then why aren't they doing them now? Answer: Because they're hard and dirty. It's time for Congress to create a new guest worker program for the agriculture industry where employees can have decent wages, access to health clinics, livable housing, workers comp in case of injury, and legal protection so that they aren't exploited. Of course, there's the catch. If growers have to pay for all that, labor economists say, it might well kill the incentive for them to participate. Immigration debate: High-stakes political poker . But it's those same growers who are now complaining that they aren't able to find American workers who are willing to pick a variety of crops that can't be harvested by machine -- peaches, plums, apples, lettuce, tomatoes, avocadoes, nectarines, strawberries, blueberries, apricots, table grapes, etc. So those employers will have to make some tough choices. If they want a reliable labor supply, it'll cost them. That's the way it should be. There is no free lunch. Either way, it's a guest workers program that will make or break the prospects for immigration reform. I'm betting it's the latter.

"(CNN) -- Second inaugurals are rarely as fresh and exciting and full of promise as the first. When a person is sworn in as president and addresses the world for the first time, there is always the chance that he will keep his promises, uphold the principles he espouses, and fulfill his policy objectives. But in a sequel, we have the advantage -- or is it the disadvantage? -- of having already seen this individual in action. So we don't just hear the words, however pretty they may be. We balance them against what we know about the person's flaws and limitations. Obama embraces key social justice movements in inaugural address . President Obama said this during his speech: ""That is our generation's task -- to make these words, these rights, these values -- of life, and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness -- real for every American."" And this: ""And we must be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice -- not out of mere charity, but because peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles that our common creed describes: tolerance and opportunity; human dignity and justice."" And this: ""Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity; until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country."" Opinion: Obama's America, better than what Founders imagined . Right about there, I realized that Obama is perhaps one of the least self-aware presidents we've ever had. He lives in his own world, of lofty ideals and soaring rhetoric. But, as he prepares for his second term, he can't escape his reality of his first term. Here is a president who claims to be seeking a new kind of justice for illegal immigrants and their families, and yet he's deported more than 1.5 million of them and divided thousands of families. Here is a president who won 71% of the Latino vote, and yet now -- with the departures of Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Labor Secretary Hilda Solis -- presides over a Cabinet with no Latinos serving on it. The nominations for the top four Cabinet jobs have already gone out, and three of them went to white males. It's nice to see that group get ahead. They never get anything. Mr. President, in your speech, you talked about the rights and privileges of Americans. You do know that many illegal immigrants refer to themselves as undocumented Americans. As they see it, they are Americans in every way but legal status -- Americans whose lives you're ruining and who you're depriving of liberty and the pursuit of happiness. They are, indeed, to use your words, ""marginalized"" and your heavy-handed enforcement policies and record number of deportations helped put them on the margins. Opinion: Obama's ringing defense of liberalism . You have not done right by this group of people, or the U.S.-born Latino community that claims to support them -- at least in nonelection years. Nor have you advanced -- through your immigration policies -- the principles of ""tolerance and opportunity, human dignity and justice."" After all, just who do you think has ""expelled"" so many of these ""striving, hopeful"" immigrants from our country? That's right, Mr. President, you're the one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: In second inaugurations we receive promises more cautiously .
He says Obama says life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, opportunity should be for all Americans .

Navarrette: He has not done well by Latinos. Where are new Latino Cabinet members?"
"(CNN) -- ""It's about time!"" That was how a friend and fellow Mexican-American Catholic responded to the news that Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina had been elected the first Latino pope in the nearly 2,000-year history of the Catholic Church. It was one of those spontaneous utterances that, while not politically correct, was at least honest and heartfelt. It's about time. And for wayward Latino Catholics like me, the election came at just the right moment. Just how wayward? I go to Mass five times a year, and it's been almost 40 years since my last confession. Even when I do go to church, I'm what they call a ""cafeteria Catholic."" I pick and choose what I like from sermons and disregard the rest. I believe in the holy trinity, but I also believe in things that the Church teaches me I shouldn't believe in -- like gay marriage and a woman's right to choose. Where does that leave me? Some of my fellow Catholics would judge me harshly and accuse me of being insufficiently committed to our faith. I'm not. I'm good with my faith. I pray directly to God, and I don't need an intermediary. What I'm sufficiently committed to is my Church, which frankly -- in light of its own sins -- is in no position to judge anyone. It's because of the scandal involving sex abuse of young boys by priests that the Catholic Church is -- in my life, and I'm sure in the lives of other Catholics -- hanging on by a thread. I've been tempted to leave in disgust more than once. Opinion: Pope Francis a conservative who sides with the poor . It doesn't help that I live in Southern California, in the shadow of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. The largest Catholic archdiocese in the United States, it was until recently under the control of Cardinal Roger Mahony. The archdiocese of Los Angeles and Mahony recently settled a child sex abuse lawsuit for nearly $10 million. Mahony, who retired in 2011, was accused of helping a confessed pedophile priest evade authorities. Yet he was allowed to vote at the conclave in Rome. As a Catholic, it's hard to be idealistic, cheery and hopeful when you live in Mahony's backyard. There is always news coming out of that archdiocese, and it's usually bad. Even so, I've come to accept that the Catholic Church is home to me. It's comfortable, familiar. When I go to weddings or funerals, I know instinctively that this is where I belong. The Church is deeply flawed, and the new pope has a lot of work to do in terms of rebuilding the confidence of parishioners. But I can't go anywhere else. It's human nature to want to see yourself reflected in an organization you belong to. It's why Mormons in the United States were excited at the prospect of electing Mitt Romney president. It's why Jews were just as eager in 2000 to elect Joe Lieberman vice president. It's why, in East Coast cities like Boston or New Haven or New York, for generations the Irish voted for Irish candidates, and the Italians for Italian candidates. There are about 480 million Catholics in Latin America, and that's not counting the 40 million to 50 million Latinos in the United States who are also Catholic. That accounts for nearly half of the 1.2 billion Catholics on the globe. Even for a people who often think not in terms of years but centuries, and who are famous for their patience, 20 centuries is a long, long time to wait for an acknowledgement that you exist, that you matter, and that you deserve respect. Opinion: Argentina a complex crucible for Pope . Now the wait is over. Pope Francis is of Italian descent, but he was born in Buenos Aires in 1932. Raised in Latin America, he speaks Spanish fluently and understands what life is like for the poor and downtrodden. As other commentators have rightly noted, the fact that he chose the name ""Francis"" -- in honor of St. Francis of Assisi, the champion of the have-nots -- is a hint that he intends to focus the world's attention on the issue of income equality. Meanwhile, the news of a Latino papa has sent a jolt of euphoria through Argentina and throughout Latin America. Imagine winning the World Cup Championship times 10. There also will be a lot of excitement among Latinos in the United States, perhaps enough to reignite their passion for the Church and bring them back to Mass. Lastly, the newly elected pope serves as a powerful symbol. He signals new beginnings. He represents the people who represent the future of Catholicism. As the first non-European elevated to pope in more than 1,200 years, the 76-year-old instantly puts Latin America on the map. This is one of the youngest regions on the map. If Europe harkens back to yesterday, then Latin America represents tomorrow. That's fitting. After all, for Catholics, this is a new day.

"San Diego (CNN) -- Did you think the Republican Party had cornered the market on racism, nativism and ethnic demagoguery? If so, think again. That is the GOP's modus operandi when it comes to the immigration issue. In an ugly trend that started in the Southwest in the 1990s but has now moved on to the South and Midwest, Republicans have learned to scare up votes by exploiting fear of changing demographics and the anxiety that many Americans have about an ""invasion"" of illegal immigrants across the U.S.-Mexico border. But this fear of foreigners has proven just effective enough that Democrats are now borrowing the GOP's playbook to advance their own causes. Here's the difference: The voters who fear-mongering Democrats want to manipulate aren't so much afraid of what worries many conservatives -- that immigrants are supposedly lowering our standard of living, changing the country's complexion and weakening our sense of national identity. They're more afraid that foreign workers -- either here in the United States or even in their home countries -- are going to take their jobs, lower wages, or prove so attractive to companies and factories that jobs go overseas. In other words, the fears aren't cultural; they're economic. But the way that Democrats exploit those fears is still the same: racism, nativism and ethnic demagoguery. Which takes us to Kentucky, where a super PAC allied with Democrats recently took the low road in attacking its No. 1 Republican target: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. In a juvenile and insulting display, Progress Kentucky recently resorted to anti-Chinese fear mongering to stir public resentment against McConnell. The goal might be to soften up the Republican a bit before his 2014 re-election campaign, where he could find himself running against Hollywood actress Ashley Judd. Politics is about finding your opponent's soft spot and then pounding away at it like Joe Frazier. Progress Kentucky thinks that McConnell's soft spot is that he has -- gasp! -- an Asian-American wife, who happens to be former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao. The group has been pounding away at this absurd idea that McConnell's wife's ethnic heritage (Chao was born in Taiwan and came to the United States with her family when she was 8 years old) has led him to support outsourcing jobs to -- wait for it, wait for it -- China. In a February 14 tweet that was ""re-tweeted"" several times, Progress Kentucky said this about Chao: . ""This woman has the ear of @mcconnellpress -- she's his #wife. May explain why your job moved to #China!"" Not really. You want an explanation for why your job went to China -- or for that matter, India, Pakistan, Brazil or some other country? Fine. How about the fact that powerful unions have driven up wages and benefits and pension plans to the point where they've placed many U.S. workers out of the market and made foreign labor more attractive in comparison? Tweet that, pal. Other anti-China tweets from Progress Kentucky included: . ""@mcconnellpress Mitch and his $$$ have VERY strong ties to #China (that place your job moved to)"" ""I think you'd have to go to NY NJ TX & China to find the people #MitchMcConnell represents! @mcconnellpress"" ""Is #MitchMcConnell too close to China? Dissident Wu 'very surprised' at Chao pick po.st/v4qoi7 via @worldnetdaily.com"" ""China Premier grateful to McConnell father-in-law/@kygop contributor-4 his role in developing China industry ow.ly/i2Qjv #kyga13"" Characterizing the Twitter messages as ""racial slurs"" and ""the ultimate outrage,"" McConnell quickly came to his wife's defense -- and his own. ""They will not get away with attacking my wife in this campaign,"" he said. ""Elaine Chao is just as much an American as any of the rest of them. In fact, she had to go through a lot more to become an American."" Earlier, Jesse Benton, campaign manager of McConnell's re-election campaign, accused Progress Kentucky of ""race-baiting"" and said the people responsible ought to be fired and should ""really be ashamed. Oh yes, they absolutely should be ashamed. When Democrats do things like this, they lose the moral ground to criticize Republicans the next time. They also tell the rest of us that maybe that outrage they claimed to feel when criticizing Republicans for similar tactics wasn't all that authentic. You know who did come off as authentic and admirable in all this? Judd. As someone who seems more and more interested in challenging McConnell in 2014, she wasted no time in condemning the attack. Judd tweeted: . ""Whatever the intention, whatever the venue, whomever the person, attacks or comments on anyone's ethnicity are wrong & patently unacceptable."" She's right. Good for her for saying so. But the intention of Progress Kentucky is quite clear -- to paint Chao as un-American and her husband to be under her influence. After initially trying to downplay the whole affair and denying any intent at ""race-baiting,"" Progress Kentucky eventually had to swallow its medicine and apologize. But, juvenile to the end, the group didn't apologize to McConnell, who was after all the subject of the attack. In a statement posted online, Executive Director Shawn Reilly apologized only to Chao for what he called an ""unnecessary comment."" Speaking of medicine, let's hope now that Republicans have had a strong dose of their own, and having been subjected to this line of attack, they've learned a lesson and will think twice before engaging in nativist shenanigans in the immigration debate. I know. That won't happen. But we can hope.

"(CNN) -- The phrase: ""President Marco Rubio"" is music to the ears of conservatives who are eager to prove they are not anti-Hispanic while still supporting one of their own: a solid conservative. And so it is that, as the immigration debate reignites, the Florida senator's star power is winning over the world of conservative talk radio. Whether it's the radio shows hosted by Mark Levin or Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh, Rubio's appearances are being met with gushing accolades. The talkers are not sold on everything he says about how to fix the immigration system, but they're praising him nonetheless. Levin called Rubio a ""very, very impressive man."" Limbaugh swooned: ""Well, what you are doing is admirable and noteworthy. You are recognizing reality. You're trumpeting it, you're shouting it."" How cozy. The reality that Rubio is recognizing is twofold. One, the nation's immigration system is broken and fixing it requires figuring out what to do with the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. And two, the Republican Party, if it hopes to live to fight another day in a country that is increasingly ethnically diverse, can't just be known as the party that is against illegal immigration but has to build a reputation for supporting legal immigration as well. Rubio: Obama sees immigration as a 'political' matter . Rubio thinks that the way you fix both problems is comprehensive immigration reform -- securing the border, making it easier for high-skilled immigrants to get green cards, starting a guest worker program for industries like agriculture with jobs Americans aren't doing, and creating a conditional pathway to earned citizenship for the undocumented. Many Republicans have a word for that: ""amnesty."" And, almost uniformly, conservative talk radio does not like amnesty. Yet, you wouldn't know it by the warm reception that Rubio got when he got on the airwaves. Right-wing talkers are smitten with the Hispanic Republican and potential 2016 presidential candidate. And it is spilling into the immigration debate. So much so that Limbaugh felt compelled in his show on both Wednesday and Thursday to insist that, no, he had not fallen madly for Rubio, who had been a guest on his show the day before. Limbaugh explained to his millions of listeners that he liked and admired Rubio and considered him a strong conservative and a star of the Republican Party. And Limbaugh suggested that this fondness for the senator might have left some thinking that he was endorsing the immigration reform plan put forth on Monday by Rubio and seven other senators from both parties. Limbaugh is not there and he may never get there. He still rejects as ""amnesty"" the idea of giving illegal immigrants an earned pathway to citizenship and rejects it as unacceptable. Besides, he insists, if the border isn't secure, Rubio is likely to drop his support for the plan as well. What Limbaugh thinks about immigration -- a subject he doesn't really know very well -- isn't important. What is important is the massive footprint that Rubio is already leaving on the immigration debate, the value that he adds to the Senate's reform-minded ""Group of Eight,"" and the near-hypnotic effect he's having on some conservatives who -- while they don't like what he's proposing to fix the nation's immigration system -- do like him a great deal. Rubio, pitching immigration plan to conservatives, identifies sticking points . Alas, the love fest is not complete. Not all conservatives are willing to give Rubio the benefit of the doubt. Some conservative bloggers -- including Michelle Malkin and the folks at Redstate.com -- are vehemently opposed to what he is proposing, and they've gone after him aggressively. Republican Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana has characterized the Rubio approach to immigration reform as ""amazingly naive."" But that hostility hasn't followed Rubio onto talk radio. So what's going on here? Why isn't Rubio getting more static from the radio talkers? I can think of three reasons. First, the Republican Party has big plans for Rubio, which may include the presidency, and the talkers know enough to get out of the way of a speeding train. Besides, when they interview him, even if they could slice him up rhetorically into itty-bitty pieces -- and I'm not sure they could -- why would they want to? Second, Rubio is a thoughtful communicator who understands radio and excels in that medium. I'm a former radio talk show host who has worked in a half dozen markets, and I know that doing that kind of work teaches you that there is such a thing as talking for radio. If you understand pacing, and when to pause or accelerate, you'll hit a homerun. Rubio does. And third, whether many Republicans realize it or not, there is a strong conservative case to be made for fixing our immigration system by encouraging the free flow of labor and saving illegal immigrants from heavy-handed enforcement tactics. The Obama administration divides thousands of families and deported a record number of people, more than 400,000, in 2012. If you're a conservative who supports the free market, family values and limited government -- and who doesn't like the spectacle of immigration agents busting down doors and hauling away grandmothers in handcuffs and dropping kids in foster care -- comprehensive immigration reform could be for you. And so could Marco Rubio. After all, he has already charmed a crowd that is notoriously hard to please. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Conservative talk radio hosts are gushing over Marco Rubio .

"San Diego (CNN) -- Even for someone who has written more than 2,000 columns over the last 20 years, sometimes the words come out wrong. All I know is that my wife is angry. ""You need to fix this!"" she says, as she holds up her smartphone. On the screen is a copy of my latest column for CNN.com scolding a faction of the DREAMers, the undocumented youth angling for legal status, for what I -- and judging from the response, quite a few other Americans -- see as a sense of entitlement. ""I hated this column,"" she said. ""I know what you were trying to say, because I know you. But other people won't understand it. They're confused and angry, and they should be. I get your point. You're saying that these kids have become entitled and self-important like other kids and they're going to blow it for everyone else -- including their undocumented parents. But that's not what you walk away from this column with. What you walk way with is meanness. And that's not you."" Bah humbug. Sometimes, it is me. As I often tell audiences that gather for my speeches, constantly cheerful and positive writers work for Hallmark. And yet, I notice that many of my critics on the left who think the tone of the DREAMer piece was harsh didn't object when, in the past, I lashed out in a similar tone against those on the right. When voters turned out Arizona State Sen. Russell Pearce, the major sponsor of that state's dreadful immigration law, I wrote that ""evil has left the building."" When Mitt Romney was overheard telling donors that he'd have a better shot at winning the presidential election if he were Latino, I mocked the Republican candidate for ""playing the victim"" because he had the ""misfortune to be born a white male."" In another column, after Romney blamed his defeat on minorities who were hungry for giveaways, I called him a ""loser."" And, when writing about the intersection of immigration and politics, I have had no trouble saying that the GOP brand is toxic to Latinos because the party has chosen to ""pander to racists and nativists."" Every time, conservatives were upset, but -- on Facebook and other social media -- liberals applauded. Could it be that what really troubles people isn't the tone of a particular column but who is being skewered? Still, as a Mexican immigrant herself, my wife has a point. And so do many of my critics. In the offending column, I was not trying to describe the individual lives of the estimated 1.4 million undocumented high school and college students in the United States. Everyone is different. I was talking about a movement, a political strategy that involves DREAMers demanding what they see as their ""rights"" and, in the process, succumbing to a radicalism that is counterproductive and threatens to torpedo immigration reform for millions of others. Like the saying goes, you catch more flies with honey than ... by donning a cap and gown and occupying the office of a member of Congress until you're arrested. Or something like that. But people didn't hear that message. They drew upon their own frame of reference and, thinking back to DREAMers they know, declared that they were swell folks who were humble and idealistic and didn't feel entitled. So, they said, I must be wrong. Ironically, some of those who reacted angrily to the column wound up making its point. One reader, who identified himself as a DREAMer who has lived in the United States for 11 years, insisted that he and his cohort weren't making demands. Then he added: ""Speaking for myself ... at this point I am done asking. I demand to be fully incorporated into this society."" Now there's a lack of self-awareness. Yet, that's also a good trait for columnists, who can always say things better and clearer. So let's try this again. For those undocumented youth who think that America owes them a fulfillment of their dreams, or who -- like the reader -- demand to be fully ""incorporated into this society,"" that first column was for you. And the scolding fits. But for the rest of you who work hard and obey the law and keep your head down and just want to find a way to live legally in a country you consider your own and where you've lived most of your life, let me first apologize for lumping you together with the demanders. Then let me give you some friendly advice: . -- Think critically. It's not enough to have beliefs. You have to constantly challenge yourselves so you know why you believe it, and can defend it. Because someday, you'll have to do so; . -- Privileges are not rights, and so they are earned and not granted by our creator. If Congress gives you the privilege of legal status, you need to decide what you're prepared to give in return. You need a plan, and a demand is not a plan; . -- Focus on deeds not words, and admit that neither political party has been courageous or honest on immigration. So don't feel beholden to either. Power comes from exercising options. Shop around; . (Last week, the Obama administration released figures showing that Immigration and Customs Enforcement broke its own record for total number of deportations. The agency removed 409,849 illegal immigrants in the 2012 fiscal year, compared to 396,906 in the 2011 fiscal year and 392,000 in the 2010 fiscal year. As most DREAMers would agree, those numbers are nothing to be proud of, especially since they appear to be driven by politics.) -- Challenge your friends with the same amount of enthusiasm that you challenge your foes. After all, in the world of politics and beyond, those you support owe you something for standing by them. Make sure you collect; and . -- Accept that, while it's true that you did nothing wrong when you were brought here as a child, someone along the line, someone in your family tree broke a law. They crossed a border without permission, or overstayed a visa. Deal with it. Before we can legalize your status, you have to accept the wrong that was done and someone has to make amends for it -- if not you, then the person who broke the rules. Above all, always try to be better people who strive for fairness, listen to different points of view, and take responsibility for your words and deeds. And I'll do the same.

"(CNN) -- What is President Obama up to? When it comes to immigration, it's usually no good. After all, this is the same president who ran for re-election packaged as a kinder and gentler alternative to cold-hearted Republicans who wanted illegal immigrants to ""self deport"" while, back at the ranch, the Department of Homeland Security was removing illegal immigrants 24/7 at a record pace. In the 2012 fiscal year that ended September 30, an unprecedented 409,849 people were deported. This was an increase from the previous year and it occurred despite policy changes -- i.e., those spelled out in the March 2011 memo by Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton urging prosecutorial discretion -- that were supposedly going to limit removals to hardened criminals. In four years, the administration has removed a record 1.5 million illegal immigrants. And while administration officials may insist that many of them were guilty of felonies and thus less sympathetic, they leave out that under current law, a nanny or gardener who is deported and simply re-enters the country is a felon. But there are two bright spots in Obama's immigration record. Last summer, the White House announced a policy change that lets undocumented young people avoid deportation by applying for deferred action and two-year work permits. And last month, in a much more obscure change, the administration said it would ease requirements to help undocumented immigrants who seek permanent residency and must return to their home countries to do so. These folks currently have to wait up to 10 years outside the United States before being able to legally re-enter. But there is a waiver that gives them permission to return to the United States sooner if their U.S.-based families would suffer an extreme hardship from the separation. Under the change, immigrants can remain in the United States while applying for that waiver. Now Obama wants to go further. According to the New York Times, Obama plans to finally make good on a 2008 campaign promise and push Congress in the next few months to move quickly on comprehensive immigration reform. His plan, which he is expected to unveil in the State of the Union address on February 12, includes a path to citizenship for most of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. Opinion: Dispel the immigration myths . It won't be easy. For one thing, there is the politics. As immigration reform advocates have learned over the last 12 years, there is no magic formula. From 2001 to 2007, Republicans controlled the White House and both houses of Congress; from 2009 to 2011, it was Democrats who controlled both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. And either time, nothing got done on immigration. And there is always a deal breaker. In 2005-2007, the last time that Congress took up this debate, the big obstacle was guest workers. Republicans insisted on language that would have brought in a few hundred thousand guest workers to do jobs that Americans aren't doing. Under pressure from labor unions, Democrats objected. The result was a stalemate. This time, the major sticking point is likely to be citizenship. Democrats, including Obama, have said they won't budge on their demand that undocumented immigrants get not just legal status, but also a pathway to citizenship. Naturally. The GOP brand is so toxic with Latino immigrants right now that we could be talking about millions of new Democratic voters, which is precisely why the GOP won't go along with immigration reform if a direct path to citizenship is in the mix. As for whether it should be, I don't think so. Here are three reasons why not: . -- Illegal immigrants don't care about citizenship nearly as much as politicians do. Their concerns are practical, not ideological. They want driver's licenses, the freedom to go to work without living under the threat of being picked up and deported and the ability to go back and forth between the United States and their home country; . -- As long as Republicans are dead-set against citizenship, we'll never get a deal on immigration reform because -- unlike the health care debate -- this issue doesn't unite Democrats. Many of those in the Midwest and South remain adamantly opposed to legalizing the undocumented. So without Republican votes, it's back to square one; and . -- U.S. citizenship is something special, and it has great value. It ought not to be bartered away in a round of horse-trading. By all means, those who are legalized should be allowed to become citizens, but only by their own effort and on their own steam. There should not be a roadblock to citizenship, but nether does there need to be a direct pathway. Opinion: Both parties must lead on immigration . Politicians always play the same game when it comes to immigration. Democrats ask for the moon and stars, and the Republicans go into orbit. They want away from the table, and Democrats don't have the votes to do anything without them. So nothing gets done. Each side blames the other. Back to the drawing board. The status quo is preserved. See you in 10 years. But, when that happens, the people who lose are the very ones who many people say they want to help -- those 11 million undocumented immigrants who live in the United States and contribute to our economy. They're caught in suspended animation, not belonging to one country or another. They deserve a pathway to legal status, and a final resolution to a debate that really isn't as difficult as some make it.

"San Diego (CNN) -- Phil Mickelson has apologized, which is the right thing to do when you do something wrong. Yet I can't accept his apology, since I still haven't figured out what the champion golfer did that was so wrong. Let me tee up this story. My fellow San Diego-area resident has been thinking a lot about taxes. And he's done some of his thinking out loud. Two weeks ago, during a conference call with reporters, the golfer made a passing reference to being concerned about ""what's gone on the last few months politically."" Last week, another reporter asked Mickelson to elaborate and he said: ""There are going to be some drastic changes for me because I happen to be in that zone that has been targeted both federally and by the state, and it doesn't work for me right now. So I'm going to have to make some changes."" It seems that the California native is thinking about leaving the Golden State and heading somewhere more welcoming to high-income earners. That's it: Mickelson hinted that he might move his family to another state. And he got hammered for it. What does he think this is -- a free country? The golfer claims that he pays about 60% of his income in combined local, state, and federal taxes. That figure seems impossibly high at first. But -- as an article in CNN Money pointed out -- with a new federal tax rate of 39.6% on income over $450,000, and a top state tax rate in California of 12.3% on income above $1 million, and a 1% state surcharge for mental health on income above $1 million, and a 3.8% state surcharge for Medicare on earnings above $250,000, Mickelson's tax bill adds up in a hurry. The article estimates that Mickelson's tax rate is closer to 53%. But the golfer was talking about taxes in the broadest possible sense. You should also factor in the Social Security taxes shouldered by the self-employed, the property taxes he pays to San Diego County for his home in the ritzy enclave of Rancho Santa Fe, where homes can cost $15 million, and any municipal taxes he pays to City Hall. In 2012, Mickelson earned about $60 million, most of it from product endorsements. Let's say that he earns the same amount in 2013, and assume that he pays at least 50% of his income in taxes. That would mean Lefty's tax bill for next year would ring up at about $30 million. That would leave him about $30 million after taxes. Whatever the exact amount of taxes that Mickelson is paying, it's hard to feel sorry for someone with those sorts of earnings when the rest of us would love to have those problems. The backlash was significant enough for Mickelson -- no doubt at the urging of his fleet of lawyers, accountants, managers, agents and public relations specialists -- to call for a mulligan. He issued a mea culpa just one day later. ""Finances and taxes are a personal matter, and I should not have made my opinions on them public,"" Mickelson said in a statement. ""I apologize to those I have upset or insulted, and assure you I intend not to let it happen again."" I hate that he apologized. I suppose that part of it has to do with my job description. As an opinion writer, I upset people all the time. I've been known to offend more people before breakfast than some people do all day. But since when did Americans have the right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness -- and the right to never be offended by something that someone else says? Which brings us to what this story is really about. It's not about taxes that are so high that bank robbers should ask the tax collector for lessons, or politicians who try to pay for runaway spending meant to ingratiate them with constituents by ""soaking the rich,"" or how the wealthy have no right to complain about paying taxes. All this is a sideshow. The story of how ""Lefty"" wound up in a rhetorical sand trap is all about freedom of expression. It's about freedom of speech. It's about freedom -- period. How ironic that this story broke the same week that President Obama, in his second inaugural address, talked about how ""while freedom is a gift from God, it must be secured by his people here on Earth"" and how, as Americans, ""our interests and our conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom"" and how we should ""answer the call of history and carry into an uncertain future that precious light of freedom."" Where did Mickelson's freedom go? The story of the golfer and his taxes is, first and foremost, about being free to have your say even when it -- oh dear! -- offends someone. Or, in this case, when it's politically inconvenient for the tax-and-spend crowd to hear. To their ears, this kind of talk is subversive. If the ""super wealthy"" complain about paying taxes, before you know it, the ""wealthy"" will decide their taxes are too high as well. Then it'll spread to the merely ""well-to-do."" That's why these outbursts have to be nipped in the bud. In the end, this story is less about what Mickelson pays in taxes than the price the entire country is paying for our oversensitivity whenever someone says something controversial. It's about where we have arrived in this country -- where we've convinced ourselves that we're entitled to go through life never having to confront an opinion on any subject that is different from the ones we hold. A couple of years ago, I heard from a reader who said: ""You know, I used to agree with much of what you wrote, and I looked forward to reading your column. But lately, we just disagree too much, so I'm going to stop reading."" That's one way to go. We can all follow suit and surround ourselves only with opinions we agree with. But let's not kid ourselves. Wherever that road leads, it isn't to a better and more enlightened society. Phil Mickelson doesn't owe us an apology. We owe him one.

"San Diego (CNN) -- Did Senate Republicans have too much bubbly on New Year's Eve and pass a bill to avert the fiscal cliff that some in the GOP insist includes too much in new taxes without cutting spending? Are House Republicans so stubborn in their pursuit of spending cuts that they're ready to go to war with members of their own party? In trying to avoid the fiscal cliff, House and Senate Republicans put the Grand Ole Party -- and the country -- on the brink of a political one. It's never good for party unity when a House lawmaker jokes that his Senate colleagues passed a late-night measure because of ""partying and revelry and drinking"" in the wee hours. Yet, that's what California representative and House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa said in an interview on CNN's ""The Situation Room."" When Wolf Blitzer asked Issa if he was suggesting that Senate Republicans were drunk when they voted, Issa backtracked and said: ""Of course not. I was just having a little fun with you, Wolf."" That's hilarious. This guy must be the life of the party. But the rest of us still have to wonder whether, after the raucous fiscal cliff negotiations, his party has any life left in it. Politics: Debt debate starts now . The House adjourned on Monday without voting on a bill to avoid the automatic tax hikes and deep spending cuts set to take place that midnight. The Senate burned the midnight oil and passed -- by a vote of 89 to 8 -- an emergency bill with more than $600 billion in new revenue over 10 years. The legislation also allowed the Bush-era tax cuts to expire for families making more than $450,000 annually. On New Year's Day, House Republicans struck back and rejected the Senate bill as insufficient in its spending cuts. Only 85 Republicans voted in favor, while 151 voted against. With plenty of Democratic support, the measure passed. But it was over the objections of most House Republicans, who will surely fight for more cuts in spending during the fast-approaching debt ceiling negotiations. The bigger drama is still playing out. We're seeing a civil war between Republicans, although at this point you really can't call it ""civil."" This is not a simple difference of opinion that can be papered over by inserting a few paragraphs into a bill. This is about different visions for what Republicans think their role should be when they're out of power. Speaking of power, House Speaker John Boehner appears to be fresh out. After failing to get enough support from those in his own party for an alternative plan in the House, Boehner wound up going ""all in"" on passing a bill. He must have thought that his speakership depended on not coming up empty-handed. Politics: Are the days of Congress 'going big' over?But Boehner might have lost a good deal of the support and confidence of his Republican colleagues. The formal vote on whether to keep him in the speaker's chair is set for Thursday. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor just might be biding his time in the wings, after he split from Boehner and voted no on the Senate bill. Boehner let the pressure get to him. Just ask Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who is never at a loss for words, and usually the wrong ones. Reid accused of Boehner of running the House of Representatives like a ""dictatorship."" So when Boehner happened to bump into Reid, a few days before the fiscal cliff deadline, in a hallway of the White House, witnesses say the speaker told the Democratic majority leader to ""go f--- yourself."" Twice. It also doesn't help build support or confidence in the speaker that he has proved to be no match for the chess skills of President Barack Obama, who always seems to have a pretty good idea of the opposition's next move. So, when Obama staged a press event on New Year's Eve to press for higher taxes on the wealthy as the House was deliberating, he had to know that the stunt would scuttle the process. That would have sent us over the cliff and ensure that Republicans got the blame. Checkmate. The trouble is, that's not leadership. It's gamesmanship. On this issue, as with many others, Obama the Master Politician confuses the two. To avoid the fiscal cliff, Senate Republicans offered a Band-Aid; those in the House wanted to treat the wound. It would have been no excuse for shirking their duty and not passing a bill, but the Republicans in the lower chamber were on the right track. We have to deal sooner or later with the federal government's runaway spending, but there's no appetite for that in Congress. There never will be. In fact, for all the talk about whether to raise taxes on the wealthy, the real sticking point in this debate was what to do about spending we can no longer afford -- especially on programs such as Medicare and Social Security. Politics: New congress tackles old leftovers . Lawmakers in both parties, who respect and fear the senior citizen lobby, won't have this conversation. So they would just as soon keep Americans distracted with an argument over who should pay what in taxes. Don't be taken in. What Americans should really be thinking about at this moment is where all that money is going and whether we can keep paying those bills no matter how high the tax rates soar. Remember how it works with your own household budget. It's not only how much comes in that matters; just as important is how much goes out.

"(CNN) -- I know just what a lot of those so-called DREAMers deserve to get for Christmas: a scolding. There are good and bad actors in every movement, and the bad ones -- if not kept in check -- can drag the good ones down with them. The term DREAMers refers to the estimated 1.4 million to 2 million young illegal immigrants who might have gotten some relief if the DREAM Act, which offered legal status in return for attending college or joining the military, hadn't been torpedoed in the Senate in December 2010. Having declared their intention to better themselves, some in the DREAMer movement now insist that they're entitled to better treatment than run-of-the-mill illegal immigrants. You know, like the hardworking and humble folks who cut your lawn, clean your house or care for your kids. In fact, the DREAMers seem to suggest they're due a reward for good behavior. At times, these young people act like spoiled brats. They don caps and gowns and disrupt committee hearings and occupy the offices of members of Congress. They dare police to arrest them, and then act surprised when it happens. They're not realistic, or respectful. They don't ask. They demand. As we learned recently, the DREAMers have a whole wish list of what they want from Congress next year after what is expected to be a humdinger of an immigration debate. A few weeks ago, more than 500 of these young people -- and their supporters -- were brought together in Kansas City, Missouri. by a well-funded organization called ""United We Dream,"" which bills itself as the largest immigrant youth-led network in the country. At the United We Dream 2012 National Congress, attendees voted for a national platform that demands the following: . -- ""Fair treatment for DREAMers and our families and communities, including a road map to citizenship for 11 million Americans without papers and an end to senseless deportations and abuses""; . -- ""The ability to travel without fear, ensuring all immigrants have access to driver's licenses and the ability to visit family in other countries""; . -- ""The elimination of barriers to higher education for immigrant youth by extending state and federal financial aid opportunities, as well as in-state tuition rates to DREAMers available to our peers""; . -- ""An end to excessive and costly immigration enforcement policies which separate families and divide communities, such as 'Secure Communities,' E-Verify, 287G, and roadside checkpoints""; . -- ""Access to health care and safe, fair working conditions and equal protection under the law for all""; and . -- ""Growth and diversity of our movement for change, intensifying efforts to become more inclusive of non-Latinos, LGBTQ communities, differently abled people, people of faith, and other groups."" Gee, kids, can we get you anything else? Maybe free massages the next time you stage a sit-in? These kids want it all. Faces of hope line up for two more years in the U.S. They demand more than just the ability to live in the United States legally and not have to worry about being deported as many others have been. This is no small thing. The Obama administration removed more than 1.5 million illegal immigrants over the last four years, and there's every indication it plans to remove just as many in a second term. Some of those who have been deported were DREAMers, despite President Obama's claim that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is removing only hardened criminals. If you believe that, you're probably also expecting a portly fellow in a red suit to come down the chimney on Christmas Eve. Last summer, Obama announced a deferred action program and offered to stop deporting DREAMers. Under the program, undocumented youth who are eligible apply for a two-year work permit. What happens after that, no one knows. The DREAMers chalked up a victory. But what some seem to really want is the golden ticket: U.S. citizenship. And they want it yesterday. They're convinced that they deserve it, and they'll settle for nothing less. Many of them reject, even ridicule, proposals by Republicans in Congress to give them legal status without citizenship -- and the voting privileges that come with it. While they probably don't realize it, their public tantrums are turning people against them and hurting the chances for a broader immigration reform package. And if they set back that cause, heaven help them. They'll sink the progress for a group of people who have given more, worked harder and made greater sacrifices -- people like their undocumented parents. You know, the people who brought them to this country in the first place for a better life, and then fed them, clothed them and sheltered them. These are the folks who told the DREAMers they were special, long before that became the official position of the immigration reform movement. That doesn't sit well with a lot of Americans -- especially U.S.-born Latinos who were raised to believe that, in this life, you get what you earn. According to polls, some 80% of them support the DREAM Act. But, for a while now, I've detected some discomfort with the DREAMers, particularly their tone and tactics. It comes from people like Arnold Torres, a Mexican-American political strategist in California (disclosure: he's a friend and business partner) who supports comprehensive immigration reform and has the credentials to prove it. More than 25 years ago, Torres was executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens and helped shape the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. Today, a lot of folks on the left talk about creating a pathway to legal status for millions of the undocumented. This guy actually helped do it. DREAMers: Deferred deportation . For almost a year, I've been listening to him grumble about the DREAMers and their goals. ""It appears that the agenda was all about getting attention, believing that this would solve their issue"" he said. ""They seem to be saying, 'If you pay attention to me, I become powerful. So we may be undocumented, but we are powerful now. You mistreated us. You're denying us our dream. Now we demand that you do this for us.' Attention is necessary, but demands are not. We want solutions, but not only for one segment of a much larger community in need."" Torres worries that the DREAMers could, through their hubris, alienate supporters and make it harder to win the backing of Republicans for a larger immigration reform plan. A lot of DREAMers are drunk on entitlement. But why should this surprise us? Feeling entitled is the American way. And these kids are as American as they come. They may have been born in another country, but -- unlike their parents -- they were raised in this one. They bleed red, white and blue, use English as their primary language and tweet up a storm before breakfast. And in a country whose motto has gone from ""E Pluribus Unum"" to ""Gimme, gimme. Where's mine?,"" they're not about to be left behind. DREAM'ers weren't born; they were created. Not long ago, the conventional wisdom in Washington was that immigration reform wasn't going to happen soon. So forget women and children. It was DREAMers first. No wonder these kids think they're special. Everyone tells them so. Undocumented students in their own words . There's only one problem. These people are still in the United States illegally. They don't like being reminded of this, but it's true. So they'd be wise to tread lightly -- especially since they don't have the leverage they once did. These kids are just not that special anymore.

"San Diego (CNN) -- Immigration groups, Obama surrogates, the media and the Democratic Party have a message for Latino voters, who some say could swing the election because they are heavily represented in four battleground states -- Colorado, Nevada, Florida and New Mexico. Here's the message: Vice presidential hopeful Paul Ryan is anti-Latino, and his immigration views are simplistic, intolerant and punitive. Really? Someone should tell that to the anti-immigrant group NumbersUSA, which advocates not only an end to illegal immigration (and there is nothing wrong with that) but also a dramatic reduction in legal immigration to pre-1965 levels (there is a lot wrong with that). It is the views of groups such as this -- which sadly have a lot of influence on the Republican Party -- that can genuinely be called simplistic, intolerant and punitive. So why does NumbersUSA list Ryan's ""career grade"" in Congress as a ""C""? Ryan's grade puts him in the bottom 10% of all current Republican members of Congress, according to Roy Beck, the group's founder and CEO. The nicest thing that Beck could find to say about Ryan after the congressman from Wisconsin joined the GOP ticket was that Ryan ""doesn't seem to have put a lot of thought into immigration policy and doesn't seem to have deep ideological reasons for his poor immigration record."" Wow. That's a ringing endorsement, isn't it? If someone like Beck thinks you have a ""poor"" record on immigration, it means you have both a heart and a brain. Specifically, Beck is miffed at the Wisconsin Republican for not signing onto enough immigration enforcement bills and for co-sponsoring -- over the last 10 years -- various ""amnesties to give illegal aliens a path to citizenship."" Sure enough. Ryan's record bears out he has over the years co-sponsored or voted for a number of bills that would have given legal status to illegal immigrants. Beck tries to look on what he considers the bright side by suggesting that Ryan might be going nativist because lately he hasn't sponsored ""any bills that would reward illegal aliens or increase legal foreign workers"" and because Ryan's website ""takes a fairly strong stand against amnesties."" He also likes it that Ryan opposes the DREAM Act, which would have given legal status to illegal immigrants who attend college or join the military, but he wishes that Ryan hadn't expressed ""sympathy"" for the young people who stand to benefit from such a proposal. As Beck sees it, much of the problem with Ryan on immigration is that he hangs out with a bad crowd. In the early 1990s, Ryan worked for Empower America, a Washington-based think tank run by William Bennett, a former U.S. education secretary and current CNN contributor, and Jack Kemp, the former congressman and U.S. housing secretary. Both Bennett and Kemp had pro-immigration views and warned fellow Republicans not to get on the wrong side of demographics by alienating Hispanic voters. That's the message that Bennett and Kemp took to California in 1994 where -- along with their friend, conservative columnist Linda Chavez -- they angered fellow Republicans by taking a public stand against Proposition 187, a dreadful ballot initiative that threatened to cut off education, welfare and nonemergency health care to illegal immigrants. The picture that emerges is that Ryan's views on immigration are complicated and hard to pin down. He wants to secure the borders, but he has in the past voted for proposals that would have given select groups of illegal immigrants who are already here -- such as agricultural workers -- a pathway to earned legal status. He also supports using temporary guest workers to offset labor shortages in some industries. In short, in a party where the loudest voices on immigration seem to belong to those with the most infantile views (See: Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, who in 2006 suggested fortifying the U.S.-Mexico border with electrical wire because ""we do this all the time with livestock""), Ryan seems to be a grown-up and a pragmatist. For instance, his support for guest workers suggests he understands there are jobs that Americans won't do and must be done by foreign workers. Also, while he is against illegal immigration, there isn't much evidence of him demeaning or demonizing the immigrants themselves. This is not good news for Democrats who would dearly love to paint Ryan as anti-immigrant and anti-Latino. Say, are they sure they're not talking about President Barack Obama? His record on immigration is atrocious, capped off by a staggering 1.5 million deportations, the dividing of hundreds of thousands of families, the placement of thousands of U.S.-born children in foster care once their parents have been deported, and one falsehood after another intended to obscure all this. With such a record, it's hard to trust the administration and believe it is suddenly trying to do the right thing with the election-year giveaway of deferred action for so-called ""DREAM-ers"" -- young illegal immigrants who would have benefited from the DREAM Act. In contrast, Ryan hasn't done anything wrong or been in a position to make bad policy. All he seems to be guilty of is being affiliated with a party that has a poor record on immigration. Now that could change in the days to come as he moves closer to Mitt Romney on immigration. We'll see. But, at the moment, he's not trying to deport anyone. All he wants to do is help evict someone -- the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Ryan needs to clarify his immigration views. And if it turns out they're complicated and unpredictable and nuanced and don't look as if they came out of a cookie cutter, then all the better. Most Americans feel the same way.

"(CNN) -- Imagine what it must be like to be born in one country but only know another, to be labeled ""illegal"" but feel 100% American, and to be asking for special dispensation from a government that has shown a flair for arresting and deporting people just like you. ""Samuel"" doesn't have to imagine this life. He's too busy living it. The recent high school graduate is one of about 82,000 Dreamers who opted to roll the dice on a new government program that promises temporary relief for young illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, have no criminal record and are pursuing higher education. They're called Dreamers because they might have qualified for legal status under the Dream Act if the bill hadn't died in the Senate in December 2010 when 36 Republicans and 5 Democrats voted against cloture. Samuel agreed to talk to me, but only if I agreed not to reveal his name or give out too much personal information about him or his parents. Opinion: 'Illegal immigrant' is the uncomfortable truth . Ah yes, the parents. If there's an illegal immigrant who was brought here by his parents, there is a good chance that his parents are undocumented as well. And here the government -- the same agency that carries out deportations, Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- is asking you to hand over your personal information, including your address, where agents might find you and your parents and haul you all away. Samuel graduated from high school with honors a few months ago, and now he's in a state of suspended animation. He can't enroll in college, because he can't afford the cost of out-of-state tuition. Unlike many of his friends, he doesn't have a job. But it isn't because he doesn't want to work. The problem is that he doesn't have a Social Security number or a driver's license. He's stuck. He can't go forward, and he can't go backward. Samuel's parents brought him to the United States from Mexico as a child. This is where he was raised, and he can't imagine living anywhere else. ""This is the only country I've known all my life,"" he told me. He dreams of getting a driver's license, getting a job, going to college, attending medical school, perhaps one day becoming a doctor. But, all his plans are written in sand. In Samuel's life, nothing is certain. Nothing, that is, but the two or three page application he filled out to apply for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. It was, for him, an easy decision. He had waited a long time for a chance like this. And he quickly seized the opportunity. That was probably a smart thing to do. Deferments could be granted on a first-come, first-served basis. He is supposed to receive a response in the mail in the next few weeks. Radio: Undocumented students in their own words . The Deferred Action program, in the universe of immigration enforcement, falls somewhere between a leap of faith and a crapshoot. If granted temporary relief, applicants can apply for a two-year work visa. There's no direct path to permanent legal status or U.S. citizenship, and the deferment can be revoked at any time. Meanwhile, the federal government -- which previously didn't know you existed, and you liked it that way -- has opened a file, taken your fingerprints and collected all your information. It's not a very good deal. But, for undocumented youth, it's the only deal on the table. So far, there are few takers. The 82,000 who have submitted applications are just 7% of the estimated 1.2 million people who are eligible for the relief. To qualify, an applicant has to meet certain criteria: be under the age of 31, brought to the United States before the age of 16, have lived continuously in the U.S. since June 15, 2007; no criminal record, in school or graduated high school, or a military veteran. According to immigration lawyers I've spoken to, who have been fielding calls from Dreamers who have lots of questions, some would-be applicants worry that Mitt Romney could win the election; the Republican will not say whether he would sustain the deferment. All he has said is that we need a permanent solution and that he would replace the program with a better one. In June, Romney told a gathering of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials that he would ""put in place my own long-term solution that will replace and supersede the president's temporary measure."" What does that mean? No one knows. But, according to the lawyers, other would-be applicants are just as worried about the possibility of an Obama victory. Which Obama will show up in his second term: the one who proposed the solution, or the one whose excessive deportation policies created the problem? During a recent forum sponsored by Univision, the Spanish-language television network, Obama said he announced the new policy because, as he met with young people from around the country, he concluded that it wasn't ""fair or just for us to have them suffering under a cloud of deportation."" That's a nice sentiment, Mr. President. But guess what. You're the one who created the cloud by deporting a record 1.4 million people in about four years. That is what happens when a bureaucracy goes overboard. It is a record to be ashamed of. So, if Obama is re-elected, do things get better for the undocumented or worse? No one knows. Meanwhile, Samuel is aware of the risk. What really drove it home, he said, was when his mother, who is also undocumented, had to take him to the local Immigration and Customs Enforcement office to fill out the application. He worried something might happen to her, that someone might question her, that she might give the wrong answer. What about him? Wasn't he worried about putting himself in jeopardy? Here he is walking into the jaws of the beast, so to speak, right into the office of the very agency that is breaking all deportation records under this president. Wasn't he afraid that he was making a mistake? ""There's always that thought in the back of your mind,"" he said. ""Because you're giving over all this information to these people who have total control over whether you get to stay here or not. It was a little nerve-racking, but we got through it. And now we're just waiting and hoping for the best."" Nerve-racking is right. A lot of good people are putting it all on the line. This is a high-stakes game. It had better not be rigged.

"(CNN) -- On a recent trip to Mexico City as part of a delegation of Mexican-American and American Jewish leaders, I heard a joke that is circulating among the intelligentsia: . ""Mexicans are observing daylight savings time in a major way. On December 1, they'll turn the clocks back 100 years."" Actually, it's not quite a century. The reference seems to be to 1929, when the Institutional Revolutionary Party (or an earlier version of it) kicked off what would be a 71-year hold on the presidency. In the 20th century, PRI became notorious for the brutality, corruption, election rigging, and brazen thievery of its leaders and their cronies. Now, after 12 years out of power, the PRI is returning to the scene of its crimes. The party is about to retake the reins of power thanks, in large measure, to the popular appeal of a handsome, charismatic and personable 46-year-old lawyer who seems to have stepped right out of central casting. He is even married to a beautiful telenovela actress. Enrique Pena Nieto is set to take office on December 1. Mexicans feeling persecuted flee U.S. This has been a Hollywood ending for a political party that was, just a few years ago, on the brink of extinction. The first blow came in 2000 when the National Action Party's Vicente Fox broke the PRI's hold on the presidency. Then came heavy losses for the PRI in Congress during the 2003 midterm elections. That was followed by another victory for the PAN in 2006, when Felipe Calderon took the presidency -- and the PRI candidate came in last among the top three political parties. But then, the PRI regained some ground in the 2009 midterm elections -- in part, it seems, because the Mexican public was so battle-weary after three years of Calderon's bloody war against the drug cartels. Don't get me wrong. The drug war is messy but necessary, and that's true in both the United States and Mexico. Legalizing drugs and making them more readily available would, in either country, increase the number of addicts, lead to more street crime to feed consumption habits, destroy scores of families, make people less productive and more dependent, and empower criminals by surrendering the fight. Opinion: Mexico, U.S. ties ripe for major expansion . And yet, it all comes at a high cost. South of the border, the drug war has resulted in the deaths of more than 50,000 Mexicans. And, because it has become more difficult to move drugs to the United States and Canada, it has brought to Mexican society a domestic drug consumption problem that Mexicans have long been content to export to the United States. Even the man who started the war -- or, as Mexicans like to say, stirred the hornet's nest -- now claims that it's not winnable. Calderon, the outgoing president of Mexico, recently conceded in an interview with The Economist that ending the consumption of drugs and drug trafficking is ""impossible."" As Calderon sees it, the real goal of the drug war is to disrupt the drug trade and keep money out of the hands of killers who terrorize the Mexican people. Those people are now taking another look at the PRI. The way they see it, the party may have been corrupt, but at least it was competent. Unlike the PAN, whose leaders seem obsessed with causes and crusades -- for Fox, defending Mexican immigrants in the United States, and for Calderon, the drug war -- the PRI kept the trains running on time. Can Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto save Mexico? As many Mexicans see it, the country needs to move on to other business. They expect Pena Nieto to lead the way. They may not want a complete and unconditional surrender to the drug cartels, but they could live with an accommodation that included an end to the violence. The battle against the drug cartels is sure to be on the agenda Tuesday when Pena Nieto is scheduled to visit the White House and meet with President Barack Obama. I had the chance to meet Pena Nieto during my trip and hear about his vision for building a new and improved Mexico. Despite the knocks that he has taken from the Mexican press and the elites for not appearing to be book-smart, he has more than his share of ""EQ"" -- emotional intelligence. This will carry him far with a Mexican public that, at this point, wants to have leaders that it can relate to, who will address its everyday concerns. Mexico's misconceptions . Like a certain recent U.S. president from Texas, Pena Nieto is taken lightly by many as he enters the office. Yet sometimes being underestimated can be helpful. And just as George W. Bush reached the height of his popularity after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Pena Nieto might yet surprise his critics and rise to the challenge of dealing with a major crisis when faced with one. In his meeting with Obama, the Mexican president-elect is likely to dwell on what he believes the U.S. can accomplish for Mexico. This will probably include delivering the last few hundred million dollars worth of equipment and supplies that is owed to Mexico to help it fight the drug cartels under the $1.4 billion Merida Initiative; safeguarding the rights of Mexican immigrants in the United States regardless of legal status; and supporting the creation of a North American trade alliance (the US, Mexico and Canada) that could compete with Asia and the European Union on the stage of global commerce. But Pena Nieto should also focus on what Mexico can accomplish for the United States. He could pledge to continue the drug war and keep the pressure on the cartels, in the spirit of the Merida Initiative; vow to create more jobs and better-paying jobs in Mexico, especially in the poorest regions that produce most of the illegal immigrants to the United States; commit himself to addressing the severe inequalities between Mexicans, closing the huge gap between rich and poor, and expanding the middle class in a country where more than 50% of the population still lives in poverty; and pledge to open up the Mexican petroleum industry to investment from North America and partnerships with American and Canadian oil companies. Latin America's challenge . All of this would benefit not only the relationship between Mexico and the United States, but also the lives of Mexicans. Those people seem to be tired of crusades. Now, it appears that they want their leaders to focus on the basics: creating better-paying jobs, protecting the population, expanding trade, improving access to technology, developing infrastructure in rural areas, and improving relations with foreign countries and trade partners. Those are some of the challenges facing Enrique Pena Nieto. How he addresses them will tell us whether the Mexican people who elected him, and returned his party to power, made a wise choice or a bad mistake. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Mexico's incoming president Enrique Pena Nieto meets with Obama on Tuesday .
Ruben Navarrette: His election means a return for PRI, party that held presidency for 71 years .
Mexican people are tired of crusades such as drug war, want a return to basics, he says .

"(CNN) -- When an elected official whose heart seems to be in the right place offers a courageous perspective on an important subject, I'm inclined to try to find some good in it. But in the case of Michael Bloomberg's off-the-cuff statement that police officers across the country should threaten to go on strike until citizens pressure lawmakers to pass more gun control laws, the search was arduous. After a shooting rampage at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, that killed 12 people and wounded 58 others, Bloomberg said this on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight"": ""I don't understand why the police officers across this country don't stand up collectively and say we're going to go on strike. We're not going to protect you unless you, the public, through your legislature, do what's required to keep us safe."" Oh brother. Apparently, Bloomberg forgot a couple of things. Like the fact that, in New York, a law specifically prohibits police officers from putting public safety at risk by going on strike. Or that pulling police officers off the streets would likely lead to more gun violence, not less. Or that while a private citizen can say something like that, the mayor of America's largest city needs to choose his words more responsibly. The comments were out of line, but they were not out of character for the New York mayor. Bloomberg is a co-founder of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a national organization of 600 mayors who support stronger gun laws, and a frequent critic of the National Rifle Association. Still, the day after his remarks, Bloomberg tried to head off a public relations headache by clarifying his statement. He insisted he ""didn't literally mean"" that police ought to go on strike and, in any case, he knew that it was against the law. That's all well and good. Yet there is one aspect of his statement from which Bloomberg should not back away. He needs to stand behind the link he made between the safety of police officers and the ready availability of firearms. When you're a police officer answering a domestic violence call, the last thing you want to find out is that someone in the house has a stockpile of weapons. And when you're in a shootout, you shouldn't have to worry about being outgunned by the bad guys. Welcome to the new front on the gun control debate. We should hear more from elected officials and the media about how dangerous police officers' jobs have become thanks to loophole-ridden gun laws, a pop culture that glorifies gun violence and a powerful gun lobby that terrifies gutless politicians in both parties. We should also hear more from police officers themselves, whose associations usually talk more about protecting pensions than keeping their members safe from gun violence. I don't believe that firearms are singularly responsible for mass shootings such as the one in Aurora. Still, I'd like to think that if someone purchases a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle; a 12-gauge pump shotgun and a semiautomatic pistol; 3,000 rounds of ammunition for the handgun and another 3,000 rounds for the semiautomatic rifle, law enforcement authorities might be aware of it before reading about it in the newspaper after a slaughter. But if we're going to blame guns, we could just as easily blame dark movies and violent video games. Years of exposure to that sort of thing undoubtedly desensitize young people -- and particularly young men -- to killing and violence by blurring the line between what is real and what isn't. It's probably significant that the shooter chose as his venue the midnight showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" the latest installment in the Batman series. Police say suspect James Holmes, who had been a Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, had a Batman mask and poster in his apartment. He also colored his hair and, in conversations with police, referred to himself as ""The Joker."" Don't buy that about movies? Now you know how gun enthusiasts feel. One of the frustrating things about this debate is that there is no consistency. People who object to generalizations and snap judgments about guns will accept them when they're about pop culture, and vice versa. But this much we should be able to agree on. Police officers shouldn't go on strike. But they shouldn't have to. They swear an oath to keep the public safe. The least we can do is return the favor. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Mayor Michael Bloomberg said police officers should go on strike for better gun control .
Ruben Navarrette Jr.: Mayor was wrong about strike, but right about dangers police face .
Police face gun lobby, cowardly politicians, pop culture that glorifies violence, he says .
Elected officials and police unions should act to keep police safe, Navarrette says ."
"(CNN) -- This week, Latinos experienced their own version of ""Super Tuesday."" That was the day it was announced that San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro had been chosen to deliver the keynote speech at next month's Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. It marks the first time that a Latino has headlined the event, and it's a huge story. I've known Julian for about eight years, and consider him a close friend. We talk about politics, but since we both have 3-year-old daughters, we also talk about fatherhood. We were on the phone Tuesday night talking about what he intends to say in his convention speech when the news broke that Ted Cruz, a former Texas solicitor general, had just defeated Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in the Republican primary runoff for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison. Cruz will now go on to face a Democratic opponent in the general election, which he is likely to win. This would make the Republican the first Latino senator from Texas, which makes for another huge story. I've known Ted for about 10 years and consider him a friend, too. We've been to dinner with our wives. He has a sharp mind and a good heart. Castro is a Mexican-American Democrat, and Cruz is a Cuban-American Republican. And yet, these two Latino politicos from Texas have a lot in common. They're both young -- Castro is 37, Cruz is 41. They both graduated from prestigious universities -- Castro from Stanford, Cruz from Princeton. They went to Harvard Law School. They're both well-spoken, well-connected and well-liked by non-Latinos who share their politics. The real difference is how many Latinos are reacting to these young men and their remarkable accomplishments. Word of Castro's speech is being treated unequivocally as great news. And it is: He has been handed the golden ticket that was eight years ago given to Barack Obama. This is his chance to make America fall in love with him, draw scores of new contributors from around the country and position himself for the next rung on the political ladder. Look for Castro to try to move up in 2014. The high-achiever may soon make more history by becoming the first Latino governor of Texas. It is great news for the 52 million Latinos in the United States who will continue to grow their influence and be courted by both parties as long they don't give in to either too easily. That has been a problem in the past. Latinos are loyal consumers of detergents, soft drinks and the Democratic Party. Many Mexican-Americans -- who along with naturalized Mexicans, represent nearly 70% of the Latino population -- would never think of voting for a Republican. And the GOP doesn't do much to win them over with its ham-handed approach to immigration. Meanwhile, by putting the spotlight on Castro, Democrats may have clinched the Latino vote for the next decade. This is great news for the Democratic Party, even though when it comes to fixing the public schools, shoring up Social Security or overhauling the immigration system, it tends to put its own narrow interests before the broader interests of its most loyal constituents. Democrats take care of organized labor, senior citizen lobbies, teachers unions and anyone else who takes care of them. Minorities and young people come last. Latinos have given a majority of their votes to Democratic candidates in the past 13 presidential elections, dating back to 1960. What took the Democrats so long to allow a Latino to give the keynote address at their national convention? Republicans did it back in 1984, when U.S. Treasurer Katherine Ortega gave the keynote speech at the Republican National Convention in Dallas. This new gesture is appreciated, but it is also way overdue. As for Cruz, his being endorsed and championed by the tea party makes many Latinos uneasy and suspicious, particularly Mexican-Americans in the Southwest. It's causing angst as Latinos try to figure out if Cruz's victory is a giant step forward or an enormous leap backward. They wonder if he'll identify at all with being Latino, or just fall in line behind Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina and other rigid conservatives. In fact, in the initial round of media stories, Cruz's victory was framed more as a triumph for the tea party than a breakthrough for Latinos. Nonsense. It's both. His opponent Dewhurst had waged a nasty campaign that was borderline racist in suggesting that his Latino opponent was soft on illegal immigration, with no evidence to back that up other than Cruz's Spanish surname. He deserved to lose, and I'm glad he did. It sent a message to other politicians not to waste their time engaging in this kind of ethnic demagoguery. Besides, Latinos are never going to get ahead politically in this country until they learn to split their votes between the parties to influence Republicans and Democrats. Cruz can help with that. It's true that I criticized him a few months ago in a column for betraying his moderate roots and lurching to the right in his Senate campaign.This is someone who served as Domestic Policy Advisor to George W. Bush in the 2000 Bush-Cheney campaign, and now he refers to comprehensive immigration reform -- one of Bush's signature causes -- as ""amnesty?"" But now that Cruz appears to be headed for Washington, I wouldn't be surprised if he distanced himself from the tea party the way that Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida did after getting elected in 2010. In fact, I would expect Cruz to team up with Rubio in a kind of Cuban-American dynamic duo that could steer important debates in the Senate. How could that be bad for Latinos? Beyond that, Cruz's developing fortunes are more than just a powerful symbol. It's a neon billboard that reminds Democrats that they can do much better in terms of sharing power and expanding opportunity. Why hadn't the Texas Democratic Party broken this barrier years ago and elected a Latino Democrat to the Senate, especially in light of the decades of support it has enjoyed from Latino voters? Latinos are living through a kind of political renaissance. They should enjoy the spotlight but also take advantage of it. These two political hotshots are just part of the story. Now it's up to Latino voters to make the most of their new influence and improve the lives of a community that has been poorly served by both parties -- and deserves much better. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Two Latino politicians' boosts this week could be good news for Latinos .
Julian Castro will give keynote speech to Democrats; Ted Cruz won GOP primary in Texas .
He says Latino voters support Democrats, who don't return the favor by addressing their needs .
Writer: Cruz's success might draw Latinos to the right; they're in a position to gain influence ."
"(CNN) -- Everyone talks about our broken political system. Washington is too polarized. Money dominates politics. Politicians don't know how to lead. Citizens are not as attentive to governance and public policy as they should be. Americans either ignore politics or see it is one more form of entertainment, ""American Idol"" on steroids. As a result, politicians get away with all kinds of misstatements and truths, in part because the electorate is so gullible. How do we make our democracy work better? Political reform will be essential to making sure that our institutions operate effectively. The news media needs to do a better job of separating truth from fiction and backing away from the increasingly partisan outlook of journalism. Civic organizations need to do more to make sure that voters are active in politics and, at a minimum, that they actually vote on Election Day. But education is also going to be a key part of the equation. The way in which we teach our citizens in schools and colleges is how we shape our electorate from a very young age. If we do not do a good job imparting the basics that are needed to be virtuous members of our democracy, the system will never be repaired. Unfortunately, there is some bad news on this front. A recent study by the American Academy of Arts & Sciences sounded the alarm that vital subjects such as history, literature, language, civics and the arts are in trouble. According to the report, the percentage of students majoring in the humanities has dropped in half, falling from 14 in 1966 to 7 in 2012. In 2010, only 45% of high school students were able to demonstrate a basic understanding of U.S. history. Government funding for this kind of research, compared with the sciences, has also fallen. The study points out that the federal share of funding for research in law and humanities was the only area of research that was smaller in 2011 than in 2005. In recent years, the Republican-controlled Congress has repeatedly targeted funding for political science research. The commission argues this kind of decision has hurt our nation's economy. Of the nation's business leaders interviewed in the report, 51% said they believed that a liberal arts education was ""very important."" The humanities and social sciences are essential to making good citizens. To improve our politics, we need to make sure that these disciplines remain integral to the curriculum of our students. Why? Each offers a particular set of tools that is hugely important to the ability of citizens to make good decisions. In history, my area of focus, understanding the past gives us a much richer understanding of the political problems facing the nation today. ""History doesn't repeat itself, but sure does rhyme,"" Mark Twain once said. We learn how politicians have tried to tackle problems before, what has worked and what has failed. There have been so many missteps in foreign policy, such as Iraq, that could have been averted with a better understanding of the past. We also gain a better understanding of the roots and origins of contemporary challenges. If we approach issues such as immigration with that kind of long-term vision, we are in much better shape to actually tackle the forces that cause our problems and to do so in a way that doesn't repeat the mistakes of the past. The study of language is absolutely essential in our modern world. Politics today is global. In the 21st century, the lines separating one nation from the other continue to thin. The more that our leaders and citizens can communicate across broad swaths of territory, the better understanding we will have of how our government's decisions affect different parts of the world and how events going on overseas might reshape the United States back at home. The study of English, particularly literature, is a window into understanding different perspectives. There are few subjects like English that help students really probe how other people see the world, a rigorous exercise into looking into the mind of a writer as he or she unpacks characters, place and time. ""It's always amazing how little Democrats and Republicans know about each other,"" writes David Brooks. In an era when polarization has done so much to make this kind of communication among Americans virtually impossible in politics, the practice of literature is the best way to force oneself to shift perspectives and develop empathy for the worldview of others. It also is great instruction in the art of writing and communication, another skill that seems to be falling by the wayside in modern politics. Finally, the study of civics is essential. Political science can move students beyond the horse race that is often overcovered in journalism and into understanding the larger structural patterns and institutional dilemmas that continually shape politics. Rather than just speaking about a red and blue America, we can see if the polling data actually supports that argument and, if it does, what the forces are that drive divisions between the parties. The kind of work that Nate Silver has produced in The New York Times, which offered much better understanding of what was happening in the election, is based on long-term statistical analysis rather than snapshot analysis. It's built on the kind of rigorous civics instruction that schools can provide. In one of my classes on leadership in historical perspective, a former government official from overseas spent much of the semester writing a paper about how Ronald Reagan approached the negotiations with Mikhail Gorbachev, hoping that one day he could use the lessons himself. He was recently appointed to a high-level position by his country's president and might well be in an ideal position to translate this kind of learning into action. Another student, an undergraduate economics major, decided to take one of my seminars on political history primarily for his intellectual curiosity. He told me that the readings on issues such as the Progressive Era and the history of health care were enormously helpful in his recent work advising a high-level aide to President Barack Obama. One student who had a long career as state police trooper and who worked as an adviser to a governor pursued his doctorate in history. He had returned to complete his undergraduate degree after years in the workforce and found that studying the history of American politics opened up many insights into the origins of the problems he had confronted. Others have applied their education in fields as diverse as child advocacy and international law. Too often in our race to pour resources into disciplines such as the hard sciences that have more tangible applications and output, we lose sight of the kind of learning that is essential to produce good citizens. The costs of such bias become clearer every year, as our political system suffers and, as a nation, our government seems incapable of dealing with the biggest problems before us. Policymakers would do well to rethink our narrowing vision of education. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: People deplore our broken political system, but don't seek root causes .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- You know a global scenario is serious when even Darth Vader seems scared. Developments in and around North Korea are so worrisome that they appear to have frightened Dick Cheney. The 72-year-old former vice president stopped by to visit with GOP lawmakers Tuesday and wound up talking about unpredictable, and perhaps unstable, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. According to sources present at the meeting, Cheney offered this blunt assessment of the crisis in the Korean peninsula: ""We're in deep doo doo."" Oh, that's just terrific. It's spring, and the cherry blossoms are in full bloom in the nation's capital. And so naturally our thoughts turn to... the threat of thermonuclear war? We interrupt the politically driven debates in Washington over gun control and immigration control to bring you an important message about a world leader who may be out-of-control. Welcome to the North Korean missile crisis. subtitled: The Missiles of April. It's time to think the unthinkable. In fact, if you live in Hawaii, Guam, the Pacific Islands or, as I do, on the West Coast of the United States -- or, for that matter, anywhere else within range of this bad neighborhood -- it's probably long past time. Just this week, CNN reported this: . ""The Obama administration now calculates it is likely North Korea may test fire mobile ballistic missiles at any time based on the most recent U.S. intelligence showing it is likely the North Koreans have completed all launch preparations."" And this: . The official confirmed that U.S. satellites are monitoring the Korean peninsula and 'the belief is that the missiles have received their liquid fuel and are ready for launch.'"" And, a day later, it followed up with this: . ""Countries in northeast Asia remained on edge Wednesday amid warnings from U.S. and South Korean officials that North Korea could carry out a missile test at any time."" Japan has deployed missile defense systems around Tokyo, some Chinese tour groups have canceled visits to North Korea and U.S. radars and satellites are trained on an area of the Korean east coast where Kim Jong Un's regime is believed to have prepared mobile ballistic missiles for a possible test launch. Adm. Samuel J. Locklear, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, didn't mince words when -- in remarks at a Senate Armed Services hearing this week -- he characterized the crisis as ""a clear and direct threat to U.S. national security and regional peace and stability."" OK, Pyongyang, you have America's attention -- and, for that matter, the world's. What are you going to do now? Think very carefully about how you answer that question. It seems that there is not much that U.S. leaders can do now but wait for Kim Jong Un to make the next move. But that's a high-stakes game, since he seems to be running out of moves that don't involve a missile launch. As experts on the region have been saying all week, perhaps the most worrisome aspect of this crisis is that the North Korean leader doesn't appear to have left himself an exit door. If, after all this huffing and puffing and rattling of missiles, Kim Jong Un simply backs down and goes back to fiddling with his Play Station and making vacation plans with Dennis Rodman, could his own military see that as a sign of weakness and stage a coup? And so, the 30-year-old despot may feel as if he has no choice but to finish the game. Given the volatility of the situation, President Obama and his security team have to be ready -- in the event of a missile launch -- to immediately respond forcefully. A clear and unequivocal message that goes beyond diplomacy would have to be sent. The response has to leave no doubt that this administration isn't playing games -- and that it means business. That was the message that the heroic members of Seal Team 6 delivered in tracking down and killing Osama bin Laden in Pakistan last year. Obama's liberal base was overjoyed at the use of military force in dispatching bin Laden to the other world just before a presidential election. How could it object in this case, when once again Americans -- and our allies -- are being threatened? That's the question. If there's an answer, let's hear it. And for the sake of those of us who are closest to the doo doo, let's hope we hear it soon.

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- The midterm campaigns will soon be under way. President Barack Obama has a few more months in the hot days of summer to get legislation through Congress, but representatives and senators will soon be focused on their campaigns with little thought for anything else. The midterm elections will be extraordinarily important for the composition of Congress. If Republicans can expand their numbers in the House and Senate, they might develop enough muscle to stifle Obama from accomplishing anything else. It could also be enough to put pressure on moderate Democrats to further undercut the legislative gains of the first term by enacting spending cuts and weakening the regulatory apparatus of programs like Dodd-Frank. On the other hand, if Democrats do well they can improve their standing in the House and place more pressure on Republicans to make compromises. Besides the composition of Congress, the midterms will provide some insight into the challenges each party will face and what promises they might make in the 2016 presidential election. The shape of the campaigns will start to clarify what the Republicans intend to stand for and whether they can put forth ideas that excite, rather than turn off, voters outside the reddest parts of the country. The rebellion taking place within the GOP has been growing more intense. Many senior leaders are warning that their party is on a destructive path that will only lead to more rounds of defeat. Many Republicans privately agreed when former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole said the GOP ought to be ""closed for repairs"" until next year, and in the meantime, ""spend that time going over ideas and positive agenda."" Since 2010, Republicans invested almost everything in the issue of deficit reduction and saying no to everything that came out of the White House. The bet hasn't been paying off. At a certain point, voters seem to have lost interest in the message and, now that the long-term budget picture is doing much better while the economics of austerity has come under fire, the issue is gaining even less voter traction. The midterm elections will be the opportunity in the next two years for Republicans to show voters they have something more to say, and to offer two or three big ideas they can use in the race for the White House. Democrats face a similar challenge. They need to start hinting at what their party will be about in the post-Obama age. Many Democrats are wondering if the next election will be like 1988, when Vice President George H.W. Bush campaigned on Ronald Reagan's record and essentially promised to do more of the same, just in kinder and gentler fashion. Or will Democrats try to offer something more transformative -- a governing agenda for the challenges we face in 2016 rather than those we faced in 2008? Voters want to hear what Democrats have to say about federal investments in the nation's economic future, about how to handle climate change and how to build on Obama's promise to restore the balance between law and civil liberties and homeland security. If Democrats can start developing ideas for the next candidate to run on, they could not only bolster their numbers on the Hill but strengthen the platform for the next crop of candidates to win over voters. There are also questions about the mood of the electorate. Everyone will have a close eye on the immigrant vote. Although the turnout is much smaller in midterm elections, given the heat of the immigration debates, it will be significant to see if the energy levels are still high among immigrants for the Democrats and how much Republicans have been able to improve their standing with some high-profile party members like Marco Rubio coming out for reform. It will also be important to see whether any kind of anti-immigrant backlash sets in, similar to what Democrats saw against civil rights in 1966 following the race riots in Watts and other cities. The outcome of the debate over immigration legislation in the House will have a big effect. The aftermath of the recent controversies will also be significant. Right now the political cycle is in full scandal swing. The midterms will provide some sense of whether those stories have legs, either detrimentally for Democrats as Republicans suffered in 1974 after Watergate or whether a backlash sets in against the GOP, as New Gingrich and his allies suffered in 1998 amid the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Finally, the midterms will offer a platform for future presidential candidates to show their stuff. In 1966, former Vice President Richard Nixon seized the national spotlight, campaigning for Republicans across the nation, and making it clear, through his fundraising and speeches that he was a formidable candidate who could take on Lyndon Johnson, or any other Democrat. This year, candidates from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will seek to use this moment, with the national spotlight turned on the political playing field, for the same advantage. It will also be a chance for the parties to shake off some of the challenges that are holding them down, such as the right-wing drift of the GOP -- which could hurt the chances of the Republican candidates in 2016, regardless of how charismatic and talented they are. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Midterm elections could change the balance of power in Congress .

"Washington (CNN) -- In some of the most personal and unscripted comments on race of his presidency, President Barack Obama broke his silence Friday with surprise remarks from the White House on Trayvon Martin, his first public comments since a Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the teenager's shooting death. ""You know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son,"" said Obama, who entered the White House briefing room Friday afternoon without notes or a teleprompter. ""Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me, 35 years ago."" ""And when you think about why, in the African-American community at least, there's a lot of pain around what happened here, I think it's important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away."" But across the country, different audiences appear to have heard very different things in Obama's remarks. From social media to comments on the Web to on-air discussions, Obama's remarks were seen as both ""a truly historic moment"" and simultaneously said to have been ""fanning the flames of racism."" ""So much for this president 'transcending' race,"" said conservative commentator Tara Setmayer on her Facebook feed. ""Obama's comments as President of the United States today were quite provocative and racially inflammatory."" Robert Camacho had just the opposite feeling, commenting on CNN.com. ""Thank you Mr. President. I am proud of you taking the first step, is up to ALL of US to stop this."" But Tasha Wells shot back on Facebook: ""STOP RACE BAITING!!!!! He is not guilty. Stop this mad witch hunt!"" CNN senior political analyst Gloria Borger focused on the tone Obama took, saying that the president was speaking from the heart, ""not using a teleprompter, like we very often see this president using. The words that come to mind are heartfelt,"" she said. ""Very sober about this. Talking about how African-Americans look at this case through a history that doesn't go away."" Phillip Agnew, executive director of Dream Defenders, an activist group that promotes nonviolent social change and has been protesting Florida's ""stand your ground"" law, told CNN that he was encouraged Obama ""was speaking about the issues in the way we are speaking about the issues."" ""I hope he follows that up with action ... in any way that he can,"" Agnew said. Agnew praised the president for ""lending his voice to the situation"" and ""showing some bravery and showing some leadership at the top."" He added that ""we're hoping other leaders, including our governor, follow suit."" Gov. Rick Scott met overnight Friday with Dream Defenders protesters staging a sit-in at the governor's office and defended his position not to amend the controversial law. The protesters said they will continue their sit-in until their demand is met. Obama last dealt with themes of race head-on as a presidential candidate in 2008, when he talked about his own struggles with race during a speech at Constitution Center in Philadelphia. ""At various stages in the campaign, some commentators have deemed me either 'too black' or 'not black enough,'"" he said then. Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor and former head of the Democratic National Committee, responded on Twitter to Obama's comment that he didn't see a need for politicians to lead a national discussion on race. Responding to Obama's comment that he didn't ""think it's particularly productive when politicians try to convene discussions"" on race, she tweeted ""Agree with #POTUS."" Ben Ferguson, a conservative commentator and CNN political contributor, was surprised that Obama even addressed the issue of race. ""I'm shocked because he said he was going to be the president for everyone, and obviously today he said I'm going to be the president for just the African-American community, and everyone else better listen up,"" said Ferguson. ""The president's job is to be president for everyone. He basically said to everyone protesting that the system is broken for African-Americans. You have a right to be angry about this."" Both others pushed back. ""This isn't something that Black men make up or want to happen,"" said CNN's Don Lemon. ""If you have the most powerful African-American man in the world telling you that there is a problem -- there's nothing in this politically for him -- perhaps people like Ben Ferguson ... should listen, should sleep on it, before they react and deny the context of what could have happen to Trayvon Martin and what could be, what is happening to most African-American men in this country."" According to a recent Gallup poll released before the Zimmerman verdict, 52% of African-American are dissatisfied about how blacks are treated by society, while 47% say they are satisfied.","NEW: Head of group protesting Florida law praises president for ""bravery"" of remarks .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Cuban President Raul Castro told legislators Saturday that the country's economy would undergo significant change in the coming year, but added that the measures aimed to bolster socialism -- not make Cuba a capitalist nation. Castro has begun a radical shakeup of the Soviet-style economic model, previously announcing the elimination of one million state jobs and the expansion of private businesses. Cuba's National Assembly tapped him as the Caribbean nation's president in 2008, ending nearly five decades of rule by his older brother Fidel Castro. As part of the plan, Cubans are being allowed and even encouraged to go into business for themselves, working as barbers, plumbers and even birthday clowns as the government tries to boost productivity. ""The measures we are applying, and all of the changes that are necessary for the modernization of the economic model, are aimed at preserving socialism, strengthening it and making it truly irreversible,"" said Castro, according to a copy of his speech published by the state-run website Cubadebate. Castro has called for debates across the country before April, when the Communist Party holds its first congress in almost 14 years at which they could approve his plan. In the speech, he insisted there should no longer be a stigma attached to working in the private sector. ""Many Cubans confuse socialism with handouts and subsidies, equality with egalitarianism,"" said the president, who spoke at the close of the country's National Assembly in Havana, according to Cubadebate. The government expects the Cuban economy to grow 3.1 percent next year, up from a projected 2.1 percent growth in 2010. ""We can assure you that, this time, there will be no going back."" said Castro.","The president says the aim is to make socialism ""irreversible""

"(CNN) -- The stars seem to be aligning for immigration reform. The election of 2012 scared many Republicans into thinking that their increasingly hardline stance on immigration is cutting against big demographic changes. These Republicans fear that they might risk writing themselves off for decades to come, if the GOP loses a vital part of the electorate to Democrats. A growing number of prominent Republicans are coming out in favor of a liberalized immigration policy, including the tea party darlings Sens. Rand Paul and Marco Rubio. During a recent speech to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Paul said that ""immigration reform will not occur until conservative Republicans, like myself, become part of the solution."" Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York announced that an eight-person bipartisan group will soon reach a deal to move forward in the Senate. So it appears that the opportunity for bold immigration reform has finally arrived. But as any observer of congressional history knows, nothing is inevitable on Capitol Hill, particularly in the current Congress, where both parties remain extremely polarized and there are high costs for bucking the party orthodoxy. What needs to happen to close a deal? It is instructive to look back at history when Congress passed two landmark civil rights measures: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Both were highly controversial; but ultimately, they went through as a result of bipartisan deals. Even though Congress is different in this era -- with both parties deeply divided internally and a closed committee system that dampens the power of party leaders to control members -- those historical struggles offer some instructive lessons for today as to how to seize a great opportunity that emerges. The news media have always been a powerful force in our society. At times, they have helped push our political system toward reform. Right now, a new generation of reporters can shine by taking on the biggest stories of the day that would have long-term impact on the direction of our country. This is what happened during the early 1960s, when a young generation of print and television reporters brought the nation vivid reports from the front lines of the civil rights struggle. In those years, reporters covered the brutal clashes that were taking place in southern cities like Birmingham and Selma, Alabama, showing the nation the reality of race relations. When presidential speechwriter Richard Goodwin watched the clashes on his television screen, he instantly understood how the media were transforming the national conversation. He noted, ""For a century the violence of oppression had been hidden from the sight of white America. ... But now the simple invention of a cathode ray tube, transforming light into electrons, registering their impact on the magnetic tape, had torn the curtain away. And America didn't like what it saw."" Similarly, in the new Internet age that we live in, the media can offer the nation a better understanding of the plight of immigrants who are living in this country and the kinds of problems that legislation can redress. Too often, discussions about immigration have revolved around vague and caricatured images. In the next few months, young and enterprising reporters can help politicians and voters see why the government needs to resolve this issue and how it can best do so. Another important lesson from history is the need to reach out to the other side when a rare opportunity comes along. In the civil rights debate, President Lyndon Johnson depended on the Senate minority leader, Republican Everett Dirksen of Illinois, to deliver the votes needed to end a filibuster in 1964. In order to get Dirksen on his side, Johnson told his administration team and congressional leadership to play to Dirksen's ego and sense of history. The key was to allow Dirksen to shape the bill, within certain parameters, so that he could leave his imprint on the measure. ""You get in there to see Dirksen!"" Johnson told Sen. Hubert Humphrey, the Democratic whip who was shepherding the bill through the Senate. ""You drink with Dirksen! You talk to Dirksen! You listen to Dirksen!"" Dirksen made some important changes to the bill during the negotiations but in the end, he delivered over 20 Republican votes, which killed the filibuster. Johnson got what he wanted. President Obama will need to make the same kind of moves, giving Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell some kind of a role so that he can buy into the legislation and win some amount of credit for producing a bill. The president will need to do the same in the House, where Speaker John Boehner will play a vital role as he tries to tame the radicals in his caucus. While giving either Republican such a role might frustrate Democrats who feel that their party is in command, the results could be powerful. Immigration rights activists can sit tight as the final months of the debate unfold. For all the talk about bipartisanship in the 1960s, the reality was that bipartisanship was often produced when legislators felt immense pressure from the grass roots. When the Senate debated the civil rights bill in a lengthy filibuster that lasted 60 days in the spring and summer of 1964, civil rights activists -- who had already forced Congress to deal with the issue through a mass march on Washington -- conducted protests in states and districts and gathered in Washington to lobby members. The immigration rights movement has been extremely effective in recent years, and now it must show its chops once again. It must also form alliances with other organizations, such as civil rights and gay rights groups, that have indicated they are willing to enter into a broader coalition to support this cause. The movement needs to work on legislators who are currently on the fence, especially Republicans who are thinking of joining Rubio, Paul and others. The key is to do this without stimulating some kind of backlash in their constituencies. The moment for an immigration deal has arrived. The political incentives for saying yes are strong in both parties, and this is an issue that needs a resolution. The key question will be whether Congress seizes this opportunity or whether partisanship paralyzes the institution once again, as it has done so many times before. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: It appears that the opportunity for bold immigration reform has finally arrived .

"(CNN) -- A massive political fight over defense spending is about to take place. If Congress does not take action by March 1, there will be $1.2 billion in across-the-board spending cuts that Congress and President Obama had agreed to as part of the debt ceiling agreement of 2011. Like with many other issues, Republicans are trying to figure out what their position should be in the post-2012 election world. With two consecutive losses in presidential elections and approval ratings in the tank, the party leadership is trying to figure out how to broaden rather than contract their electoral coalition. The best evidence of this came with the bipartisan agreement on immigration reform announced last week. Republicans face the same important challenge when it comes to defense. During the presidential campaign, Mitt Romney embraced a predictable response by warning that cuts would devastate the military and endanger American security. He often drew on Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta's warnings to make his case. Other Republicans have joined the chorus of politicians who want to paint the Democratic administration as weak on defense. Writing for CNN.com, William Bennett, who worked in President George H.W. Bush's administration, warned that the defense cuts would be the ""most dramatic and dangerous"" in history. Likewise, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham remarked: ""How do you go to somebody in the military who's been deployed four or five times ... and say, 'For your good work over the last decade, we're going to ruin the military. ..."" This approach to the defense cuts, insisting that they should not happen and that high levels of spending are essential to the safety of the nation, fits into the recent history of the GOP. Over the past four decades, Republicans became increasingly hawkish on national security. Skeptics of military intervention, such as Sen. Chuck Hagel, were pushed aside as mavericks and neoconservative rhetoric became the staple for the party. When it came to defense, big government was good and any questions about military spending were in fact challenges to our security. Republicans might consider tapping into a different tradition, one that grows out of their own party history, in the coming months if they want to take a more nuanced approach. For many decades, the Republican Party was skeptical about the expansion of military spending and national security programs. This was not about being isolationist. During the post-World War II period, there were important voices in the party that believed the excessive growth of government on defense posed the same kinds of risks as did domestic spending growth. Ohio Sen. Robert Taft, ""Mr. Republican,"" who was the leader of the party in the upper chamber, was a well-known critic of the Cold War buildup. While believing that the United States needed to be able to respond to the Soviet threat, he feared that excessive military spending would lead to the creation of a ""Garrison State"" that trampled on the very liberties that Americans were trying to protect. Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, a military hero who was instrumental in the World War II victory, also didn't have much tolerance for endless defense spending. He spent much of his second term fighting against hawkish Democrats to hold down the military budget. Eisenhower, who believed as much as anyone that the United States had to be tough in the fight against communists, thought that too much of defense spending was driven by partisan interests and military contractors, having little to do with what the nation actually needed. Like Taft, he feared that the huge appetite of Congress for rising spending was going to destroy the liberties and limited government that was at the center of what the United States was trying to protect. He also thought the expanding deficit would ultimately crush the U.S. economy. His famous farewell address about the ""military-industrial complex"" sent a strong warning to those who ignored this issue. But those voices were drowned out by the hawks. Republicans, especially after the Vietnam War, adopted a very different posture where the drive for higher defense spending became a core issue, as much as tax cuts. Now that defense cuts are on the table, a better partisan debate would be over where to cut defense spending and how to make our dollars give us the best security bang for the buck. This would entail a serious look at spending that has been driven too often by the needs of legislators to satisfy contractors in their district rather than decisions about what kinds of weapons are most effective. Despite all the dramatic rhetoric, the fact is that the United States spent more in 2011 ($711 billion) than did China, Russia, the UK, France, Japan, India, Saudia Arabia, Germany, Brazil, Italy, South Korea, Australia and Canada combined ($695 billion). Even with the sequestration, according to Time, U.S spending would only decline from being 40% of all military spending around the globe to 38%. As Lawrence Korb, former assistant secretary of defense under Ronald Reagan wrote in U.S. News and World Report, ""The defense budget should and can be reduced significantly without harming national security."" Korb pointed out that the cuts would only amount to 15% a year, which would still have the United States spending much more on defense on average than the country did in the Cold War. Right now, Republicans are not well positioned for this debate. Ironically, President Obama is -- given that during his first term he broke with his party with an aggressive stance toward terrorism, including the killing of Osama bin Laden, and potentially with picking a Republican secretary of defense. He is well positioned to push for defense cuts without opening himself up to charges of being a reckless dove. Republicans need to show the nation that they can engage in serious debates over the policy needs of the nation, rather than simply reiterating talking points meant to please the base. If they don't, on this issue, like so many others, the party will stand far off center and make it that much harder for the next presidential candidate to build a winning coalition.

"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court is expected to issue a number of historic decisions in the coming weeks about how the government deals with race issues. With the Voting Rights Act and affirmative action on the agenda, the nation is watching closely to see what the highest court will say. The court is tackling affirmative action through a case involving the University of Texas and a student who was denied admission. With the Voting Rights Act, the court is looking again at the law, including Section 5, which stipulates that some jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination are required to submit changes in districting and voting laws for clearance. Both issues came out of the 1960s, one under President Lyndon Johnson in 1965 and another under President Richard Nixon in 1969, with the intention of helping to correct more than a century of racial inequality. In 1965, in the wake of massive grassroots protests, Congress passed the historic legislation that ensured the federal government would protect the right of African Americans to freely participate in the vote. Johnson responded to immense pressure that came from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and civil rights protesters, who put themselves on the line and suffered violence to obtain this right. Selected quotes from Supreme Court affirmative action . In 1969, the Department of Labor launched the Philadelphia Plan, requiring unions involved in projects receiving federal funds to hire a percentage of African Americans in proportion to the composition of the local population. Nixon supported this plan as much for politics as policy. His goal was to divide the Democratic coalition by pitting African Americans against organized labor. The goal of both programs, though born for very different political reasons, was for the government to proactively tackle problems that aggravated racial equality. Johnson's speech in 1965 laid out the rationale. In a powerful address at Howard University, he said: ""You do not wipe away the scars of centuries by saying: Now you are free to go where you want, and do as you desire, and choose the leaders you please. You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say, 'you are free to compete with all the others,"" and still justly believe that you have been completely fair."" These programs have been controversial from the start. A summary of major upcoming Supreme Court decisions . As the late historian Hugh Davis Graham argued with regards to affirmative action, they moved away from the idea that the government would guarantee individual rights after they had been violated toward establishing policies whereby the government would take steps to ensure that racist practices would not even be allowed to occur. The goal, though more controversial, was to take stronger steps to design institutions that would not perpetuate racism. During the late 1960s, some members of the Nixon administration tried to push for changes to the Voting Rights Act that would have severely weakened the legislation, including dismantling the clearance provision that required governments holding elections to gain approval from the Justice Department to any changes in their voting process. But the supporters pushed back, and the laws remained intact. There have been repeated challenges to the Voting Rights Act and affirmative action, especially as it was extended into areas other than employment, such as education, but they have failed. This time the threat seems greater than before. The efforts of conservatives to transform the composition of the federal courts in a rightward direction are finally starting to pay off. For the first time, many experts feel the conservatives have the numbers they need to make substantial changes in both of these laws. The decisions will have huge ramifications. If the court begins to knock down these two pillars of civil rights policies, they would set back the government's power to deal with racial problems. These programs have been a stunning success, slowly starting to repair the immense damage caused by the nation's history of racism. The Voting Rights Act produced big increases in the number of African Americans voting and produced several generations of African American elected officials. Three questions for Clarence Thomas . Affirmative action has helped bolster the African American middle class and opened access to institutions from education to employment. To be sure, there are legitimate questions that have been raised about both of these programs, areas where they certainly could be strengthened. Experts have debated how affirmative action programs could do a better job, particularly by putting emphasis on giving those who suffer from class-based discrimination more access to higher education rather than relying solely on race as a standard. But improving and strengthening programs is different than knocking them down. If the court makes the decision to turn back the clock on these two policies, it would be a huge setback for the civil rights movement that changed the nation 50 years ago. Even with all the progress we've seen, the court must be cautious before weakening programs that respond to the many racial challenges that still need to be fixed, as well as to new ones that have emerged. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Two cases before the Supreme Court challenge longstanding policies on race .

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush stepped right into the political thicket with his contradictory comments on immigration last week. Bush, who has been known as one of the proponents of a more liberalized immigration policy, sent mixed signals about where he stood in offering a pathway for citizenship for the 11 million illegal immigrants in the country. Critics jibed that Bush had already stumbled in his first foray of the presidential election of 2016, shifting to the right to please potential primary voters, and then moving back to the center after coming under fire. As Bush's situation makes clear, immigration reform will be among the toughest tests Republicans face in the coming year as they try to strengthen their image with the electorate and make sure they are not totally out of step with the major demographic trends shaping America. Unlike almost any other issue that is being debated in Washington, whether that be the federal budget or foreign policy, what Republicans do on immigration will have huge consequences for the direction of the party. Republicans have not always been hard-line on immigration. In fact, there is a strong tradition within the party of politicians who have been on the liberal side of this question. At the turn of the 20th century, when immigrants from Eastern Europe and Southern Europe flooded into cities like New York and Philadelphia, there were many Republicans who were strong sponsors of keeping the doors open to newcomers. Some listened to big-business leaders who needed workers to fill the factories. Other Republicans also believed that immigration had always made this nation strong. President Theodore Roosevelt, who believed in the superiority of the Anglo-Saxon race, also pushed back against nativists by claiming that immigrants who could be assimilated were good for the United States and could be productive citizens. There were many Republicans who supported immigration reform in the mid-1960s. Congress revisited restrictions that had been put into place in the 1920s that curtailed the flow of immigration. There were a number of prominent Republicans, often inspired by the arguments of the civil rights movement, who supported reform. When Congress passed immigration reform in 1965, almost 85% of the Republicans voted yes. As new debates arose over immigration in the 1980s, the party continued to hear from Republican voices in favor of liberalized immigration policies. President Ronald Reagan, the hero of modern conservatism, signed a bill that provided amnesty for almost 3 million illegal immigrants, while President George H.W. Bush expanded the number of work-related visas that were available. As Reagan said, ""I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and lived here, even though sometime back they may have entered illegally."" President George W. Bush, deeply affected by his own experience with immigrants in Texas while growing up and as governor, insisted Republicans could not afford to take a hard line toward immigrant communities, many of who were often quite conservative in their politics. During a speech in Miami in 2000, Bush said: ""America has one national creed, but many accents."" As president, Bush pushed for comprehensive immigration reform but was rebuffed by his own party. The hard-line elements of the GOP have gradually gained a stranglehold on the party. They are the dominant voice as they command immense influence with the organizations and activists who shape the Republican primaries, as well as with constituencies in conservative districts of House members. Many Republicans who are contemplating a run for federal office feel they have no choice but to shift to the right to please these constituencies. At some point in the near future, Congress will deal with immigration reform legislation. The immigration question offers the GOP an opportunity to really demonstrate to the electorate that this is a party capable of change and that the rightward drift of the party can be reversed. There are many Republicans who are interested in moving forward on this question by providing a path to legalization, but they have been restrained by the hard-line elements of their party. Even with all the demographic red flags that emerged after the 2012 election, a large number of Republicans are holding their ground and making it hard for leaders like Jeb Bush to tap into this other tradition within the GOP. In 1964, Democrats faced a similar choice. For decades, the party had been divided between the Southern Democratic wing that staunchly opposed civil rights and the liberal Northern wing that believed the party needed to embrace racial equality. With Lyndon Johnson in the White House, the party came down on the side of civil rights. The decision came at a high cost, as most Southerners bolted to the GOP. But over time, that decision proved to be a defining moment for the values and image of Democrats, one that has helped win support with broader parts of the population and continues to provide a moral foundation for elected officials who join the ticket. Republicans need to make a comparable choice with immigration. This will be a big one, a decision that will clearly place the party on one side or the other of this issue of rights.

"(CNN) -- Several sitting governors might be contenders in the 2016 presidential election. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo have given indications they are thinking of running, although they haven't announced candidacies at this very early stage of the contest. Both are serious candidates. Christie, a Republican, has demonstrated his ability to handle the heat from the national spotlight and he has positioned himself as a tough, northeastern budget cutter who can appeal to moderate Republican voters and disaffected Democrats. Cuomo, a Democrat, has earned considerable praise for advancing a brand of pragmatic liberalism by championing issues like same-sex marriage, progressive tax reform and rent regulation while also fighting to reduce spending, taking on public unions and reforming government. Each governor faces some difficult challenges within their states. Over the past week, Cuomo has watched as a massive political scandal has unfolded within the Democratic Party, centering on an official who tried to bribe his way into becoming a candidate in the mayoral election of New York. The stories coming out of the state suggest the culture of Albany might not have become as different as Cuomo has claimed. Christie also finds himself in the national spotlight after the release of a shocking video showing the coach of the Rutgers University basketball team berating and hitting his players. The revelation that Rutgers officials knew about this behavior for at least a year has led to calls for the resignation of top administrators at the state-funded university, including the president. Thus far, Christie has backed away from calls to have the president removed, though he has used some tough rhetoric in his comments about the coach. Other governors are thinking of running as well. For example, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, a Democrat, is gaining some national attention by pushing his state to the left on a number of key issues, including a proposal to repeal the death penalty and the recent passage of sweeping gun control legislation. Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, has long been considered a potential superstar for the GOP. O'Malley has received some flak from the right for his fiscal record in the state, while Jindal's falling approval ratings in Louisiana could pose a big problem for a national run. The governors need to handle these challenges with extreme caution and each must make sure that his record as the chief executive of his state, always one of the biggest selling points for governors running for president, does not turn into an albatross that brings his candidacy down. In 1988, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis ran for the presidency against Vice President George H.W. Bush. Dukakis started his campaign by touting his role in bringing about the ""Massachusetts Miracle,"" the revitalization of the state's economy around high-tech industries along Route 128. At first, Republicans were worried that his record could allow the governor to position himself as a new kind of Democrat, someone who understood how to nurture economic growth and whose economic policies offered a model of smart government investment as an attractive alternative to Reagan's free-market economics. But Massachusetts, miracle and all, soon turned into a nightmare for the Democrat. Vice President Bush and his aggressive campaign staff found ways to rip apart his record in the state and they used it to defeat him. Some of the attacks were vicious, taking aspects of the state government's record and twisting them into devastating campaign arguments. The Republicans, for instance, pointed to a law that Dukakis had vetoed as governor that would have required teachers to conduct the Pledge of Allegiance with their class. Dukakis had been told in no uncertain terms that such a law would be unconstitutional. The Republicans highlighted the veto to paint Dukakis as a liberal of the far left variety. Bush adviser Lee Atwater also put together a television ad focusing on a program that a Republican governor who served before Dukakis had put into place that granted prisoners short furloughs. One prisoner, Willie Horton, had killed a man and raped his fiancÃ© during his time out of prison. The famous ad, playing on racial fears, focused on the program, presenting it as one of Dukakis' legacies. Vice President Bush targeted the pollution in Boston Harbor to question Dukakis' environmental record. ""Two-hundred years ago tea was spilled in the Boston Harbor in the name of liberty. If tea were spilled in the Boston Harbor today,"" Bush said, ""it would dissolve in the residue of my opponent's neglect and delay."" As economic conditions changed, Bush pointed to evidence that the state was starting to falter. Combined with reports of a looming budget deficit, Republicans used the data to challenge the very centerpiece of Dukakis' campaign. In 2012, another man who served as Massachusetts governor, Mitt Romney, suffered from similar challenges. Romney's signature legislation as governor, the health care program of Massachusetts, undercut some of his ability to challenge President Obama on this issue. His record of increased ""fees"" in the state and problems with the economy also became fodder for the primaries and general election. The condition and record of their states almost always becomes the prism through which presidential candidates who are sitting governors are evaluated. Sometimes governors use this to their advantage, like Bill Clinton in 1992 and George W. Bush in 2000. But often the states can turn into a problem. Cuomo, O'Malley, Jindal and Christie, who still have to decide whether to run, need to handle these challenges with extreme caution. If they don't, they might find themselves suffering the fate of Dukakis, who, like them, was once touted as the most exciting voice of his party. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Christie, Cuomo, Jindal could run for 2016 nominations .

"(CNN) -- In 2013, the Republican Party faces a big test. Members begin the new year in disarray, with their public approval ratings plummeting while Democrats still control the White House and Senate. The year is coming to a close with an embarrassing display of legislative ineptitude as House Republicans divided over a solution to the fiscal cliff. Without displaying the capacity for strong leadership, political parties can't succeed. Voters want parties that can get the nation out of trouble, not push them deeper into a hole. The GOP primaries were filled with aged political actors and oddballs who had trouble convincing Republican voters that they could really handle the presidency. Mitt Romney was the Republican choice by default. He never exhibited the kind of gravitas or inspiration for which voters look. In Congress, the problem for the GOP is even worse. In the House of Representatives, Speaker John Boehner has had almost no success keeping his troops in line. He has led a Republican Caucus that continues to drag down the image of Congress and create the impression that Republicans can't handle the responsibilities of power. The past two years of his leadership have revolved around the constant collapse of budgetary negotiations. House Republicans have used the once-routine decision over raising the debt ceiling as a tool of blackmail against the White House. Each time, the speaker has failed to bring Republicans to agreement, leaving the negotiations with Democrats in disarray. The situation became so bad that Congress and the White House agreed to impose stringent fiscal action automatically if Congress could not take action themselves. That's why we face a fiscal cliff. Nor has Boehner displayed the kind of bold courage that would be needed to break with his own party and enter into a bipartisan deal with Democrats. This was the kind of action that President George H.W. Bush was willing to take in 1990, a decision that cost him huge support. The result is a political cliff, more than a fiscal cliff, where one of the parties makes legislating impossible. In the Senate, the leadership has been more effective under Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, but only as a force of opposition. McConnell has served as a battering ram against the Democratic majority, using the power of the filibuster to hold up appointments and tie the Democrats' agenda into knots. But leadership that is good only at saying no rarely inspires -- it's about preserving gains rather than creating ideas. Even at the grass roots, conservative leaders allied with the GOP have not done well in recent weeks. In the wake of the shootings in Connecticut, the National Rifle Association, a major voice in conservative politics, responded by calling for more guns in the schools, just in the hands of the good guys, rather than on restrictions on the weapons used in this kind of carnage. As Republicans struggle to find common ground with Democrats over the budget, conservative leaders have generally been unyielding in their resistance to tax increases on most wealthy Americans, one that defies American political history and budgetary realism, to the point of making a deal impossible. While the role of movement organizers is always to push their allies toward ideological purity, effective leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. also understood that elected officials needed the space to enter into deals so that decisions could be made. Great parties are always able to find great transformative leaders. Democrats, despite a miserable economy that lasted through World War II and being deeply divided along regional lines, found Franklin Roosevelt. He brought the factions of his own party together, moving government toward breakthrough deals and guiding the nation toward points of unity. In the 1940s and '50s, Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn did the same, finding the points where Southern and Northern Democrats could agree, and even brought some Republicans along. Ronald Reagan moved competing factions into one tent for the GOP in the 1980s, as did congressional leaders such as Kansas Sen. Robert Dole, who broke through politics to find compromises on issues such as tax hikes. Today, Republicans don't have those kinds of leaders, and the public is not responding well. While there are many names being floated about for future elections, such as Bobby Jindal and Jeb Bush, the verdict is out as to how they would handle the intense pressures of national office. Republicans will need to show that their leadership won't simply perpetuate the gridlock in Washington.

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- Following their retreat in Virginia, House Republicans voted for an unusual budget plan, which the White House has given some indications it would accept. The GOP decided to temporarily extend the debt ceiling, the federal law that authorizes the government to borrow the money it needs to pay for its expenditures for three months. This would give President Barack Obama and Congress time to deal with the pending budget cuts that were left unresolved by the fiscal cliff deal, and then Congress will take up the debt ceiling again in three months. The deal also imposes a pay freeze, starting on April 15, on legislators if they fail to reach a budget agreement. Although some observers are breathing a sigh of relief that the Republicans won't use the debt ceiling to hold the administration hostage as it deliberates over the spending cut, the decision represents one more example of the kind of Band-Aid budgeting that has become normalized in Washington over the past few years. It just postpones the debt ceiling fight a few more months. The last time Congress actually passed a budget was in 2009. In 1974, Congress tried to reform the budget by creating budget committees and requiring Congress to put together an overall budget. But that system has fallen apart. Rather than a coherent approach to taxing and spending, Congress has relied on stopgap measures called ""continuing resolutions"" to keep the government working. Federal money is allocated but without any long-term plan. The budget process has become so polarized that neither party is enthusiastic about laying out a long-term plan. Senate Democrats have refused to propose a budget for fear that Republicans will attach amendments meant to embarrass moderate Democrats by forcing them to vote them down. Senate Democrats also know that House Republicans won't vote for what they put together. Rather than dealing with the budget in a rational and thoughtful manner, the entire process has become so politicized that Congress simply offers short-term budget fixes and leaves agencies in a state of constant uncertainty. The ongoing threat of massive spending cuts tied to raising the debt ceiling causes even greater uncertainty than the new normal of short-term budgets. Not only is there an absence of long-term planning, but the possibility of debilitating cuts in the future is something that has become very real. This dysfunctional approach to budgeting has terrible long-term effects on the capacity of the government to do its business. One of the main functions of the federal government has been to make long-term investments in areas where private markets are lagging. But if Congress and the White House don't adopt a budget, the nation winds up postponing decisions about making such investments. Historically, some of the most successful initiatives in our nation's capital have come when politicians were able to devote resources to structural challenges that had festered. During the 1940s and 1950s, the federal government devoted substantial amounts of money to higher education, bolstering the quality of our research universities and opening access to millions of Americans who were the first in their families to receive this level of education. Federal investment also produced our modern computing and Internet system as well as advances in military technology that have curtailed the need for using large numbers of ground troops. For all the fiscal challenges faced by Social Security and Medicare, through both of those programs the federal government made long-term commitments that substantially reduced poverty rates and inadequate health care among the elderly. Our most successful agencies have depended on some kind of stability and normality in the budget process. The most effective leaders, such as David Lilienthal at the Tennessee Valley Authority in the 1930s or James Webb at NASA in the 1960s, were given some budgetary cover from Congress so they could engage in long-term planning that improved the infrastructure of rural areas or allowed us to make huge advances in our understanding of space. In an era when conservatives and liberals often lambast bureaucrats as the prime example of inefficient and useless workers, it would be worth looking back at an era when a steady and predictable flow of funding allowed government leaders to do their job well, focusing on the long-term problems, not each short term political crisis. Those conditions no longer exist. Over the past few years Congress has engaged in a type of budgeting in which legislators simply pass temporary, quick fixes each year, leaving agencies in limbo about what their status will be in the near future and preventing policymakers from really engaging in deliberations about how the resources of government could best be used. One employee at the Federal Aviation Administration told The Washington Post, ""I still have a lot of uncertainty about the sequester (across-the-board spending cuts that are scheduled to start on March 1). We don't know where it is going to lead us as far as furloughs. It's kind of unnerving."" Appointed officials and civil servants literally can't predict what will come next. Indeed, everyone connected with an agency is left scrambling. Since the buildup to the fiscal cliff deal, military contractors have been left in a state of great uncertainty about what to expect for their businesses, which are dependent on federal funds. United Technologies Corp., the Connecticut-based company with units that work on defense programs, could not even come up with a general number to predict how many jobs were at risk in the coming year because of the current state of affairs. Back in 2011, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that using continuing resolutions to deal with the budget resulted in ""inefficient, start-and-stop management"" through short-term contacts. This kind of budgeting process makes the warnings of conservatives a self-fulfilling prophesy. It makes it impossible for the federal government to work well, as the right claims it never will. But in fact the budgeting process is the problem here, not government as an entity. The result is that in all realms of policy, from domestic programs to defense, we suffer as a nation. As the new Congress begins, legislators need to take stock and rethink the way budgeting is handled. Otherwise they will severely erode the capacity of a federal government that was once responsible for some of our most important advances.

"(CNN) -- As President Obama's second-term Cabinet starts to take shape, we can see some of the outlines of what the White House hopes to do in the next four years. The major theme is that Obama is prepared to defend his turf, tooth and nail. This is a Cabinet whose strength is defense rather than offense. Gone are the hopes of bipartisanship. Now it's time to really engage the partisan battle. Obama won't be pushing for many watershed changes in the next four years, but he is not going to make it easy for Republicans to make any deep inroads into what he has accomplished. During the last two weeks, the president rolled out his nominations on national security -- Sen. John Kerry for secretary of state, Sen. Chuck Hagel for secretary of defense, and John Brennan to direct the CIA. He then nominated his chief of staff, Jack Lew, to be secretary of the treasury. We must be careful not to infer too much from presidential appointments, since these people ultimately serve the interests of the president rather than vice versa -- but still, the identities of the members of the new Cabinet provide important hints. This is a team with experience and deep roots in Washington. It is clear that Obama, sobered after four brutal years of fighting with Republicans in Congress, realizes that he needs leaders who have clout in Congress. On national security, this is a team with deep experience that can protect the existing policies the administration has adopted. Obama has selected two Senate veterans who are also military veterans, Kerry and Hagel, with the hope of using their connections with legislators and their knowledge of the ways and means of the legislative process. Though Brennan doesn't come from the Senate, he is a veteran in national security circles, having worked at the highest levels of intelligence since the 1990s, and someone who Obama clearly feels will be effective in protecting his institutional turf should the legislative waters get rough. The nominations also send the signal that Obama will continue to emphasize the kind of pragmatic hawkish agenda that he has embraced from the start of his presidency. Since 2009, Obama has generally lived within the policy framework that he inherited from President George W. Bush. He has kept the national security infrastructure in place, followed through with Bush's plans on Iraq and Afghanistan (withdrawing in the first case and increasing troops, then diminishing U.S. presence in the second case), and strategically employed aggressive military power such as drone strikes and assassinations against the leadership of al Qaeda. None of his appointees is a dove. Kerry has frequently authorized the use of military force, including against Iraq. Hagel is a solid Republican who supports using troops when necessary. Brennan withdrew his name from consideration for the CIA in the first term because of statements he made in support of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" against detainees. In 2007, Brennan had said: ""There have been a lot of information that has come out from these interrogation procedures that the agency has in fact used against the real hard-core terrorists."" What the three men have in common is not a predilection to being doves but a belief that force should be employed only when absolutely essential and that war must be a tool of last resort. This is a vision of internationalism that has guided U.S. policy for much of the period since World War II. Both Kerry and Hagel are combat veterans who have seen the costs of war firsthand, and they thus remain more squeamish about making mistakes than many of the civilian leaders who have sent troops into harm's way. With continued tensions involving countries like Syria and Iran, this outlook will be an essential brake if pressure to go to war intensifies. For all the alleged controversy over the nominations, what is notable about all three is how they are basically supportive of what Obama has done in his first four years and, just as important, much of what Bush did during his time in office -- outside of going to war in Iraq. Although foreign policy is always hard to predict, since it depends on what others do to us as much as what we decide, this is a Cabinet that signals continuity rather than dramatic change. At Treasury, the choice of Lew sends a slightly different signal. As with the national security nominations, Lew is someone with a deep record of experience in Washington, having served in many roles in the executive and legislative branches since the 1970s. His appointment shows a shift in concern from banking to budgets. In certain respects, the choice of Lew, a veteran of budget wars since the 1990s, signals Obama's preparedness to fight Republicans over spending cuts and the debt ceiling, putting into high office one of his most effective and wily negotiators. But Lew is also a progressive, someone who believes deeply that the wealthy should pay their fair share of taxes and that Social Security and Medicare must be protected. This will be one of the biggest issues at the center of the upcoming budget wars, and by selecting Lew for this job, Obama is sending a clear signal that he does not plan to give ground easily on these programs in the months ahead. People who were still hoping for big changes on national security or domestic policy are going to be disappointed. At this point, it's too early to tell what the appointments say about new initiatives that the administration might pursue, such as immigration reform. But we do know that the president is not planning to give much ground on the programs that are in place. These nominations suggest that the administration is gearing up to fight to defend national security and the major social programs from budget cuts rather than really pushing through big reforms. At the same time, Obama has selected some of the toughest fighters in Washington, suggesting that if Republicans want big change, they are going to have to mount a pretty heroic effort to get it done. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Obama's Cabinet appointments suggest he's preparing to battle .

"(CNN) -- Avoiding the fiscal cliff can be a moment of truth for Congress as an institution. The ability of Congress to reach a deal on its own, rather than relying on tax hikes and spending cuts by default, would be a powerful push back against the loud chorus of critics who for almost a decade have been decrying dysfunction on Capitol Hill. According to a recent Gallup poll, Americans consider legislators to be some of the least trusted professionals in the nation. Car salespeople ranked only slightly lower. This is not the first time that Americans have felt this way. During the early 1960s, Congress was widely derided as a broken branch of government. A bipartisan alliance of Southern Democrats and Republicans used the committee process to bottle up legislation for years. ""The sapless branch,"" Sen. Joseph Clark called Congress in an outburst of frustration with his colleagues. But this period of gridlock was followed by a huge burst of legislation that resulted in tax cuts, voting rights, civil rights, Medicare and Medicaid, education policy, a War on Poverty and much more. iReport: How will the 'fiscal cliff' affect you? Though it would be far short of a New Deal or Great Society, a budget deal would allow Congress to prove that the critics are off. Most important, Congress could show that it can make unpopular decisions with little or no political payoff. The thing about this budget deal is that nobody would be happy with the outcome. If Democrats win, they walk away by raising some people's taxes. If Republicans win, they will cut deep into the spending of programs that are enormously popular throughout large parts of the electorate. The willingness of representatives and senators to take unpopular action is the best sign that the institution can fix national problems and not simply reward constituents. A budget deal could also show that bipartisanship is not impossible in our current era of polarization. The inability to achieve bipartisan legislation has been one of the biggest failings of Congress. When there has been bipartisan agreement in recent years on domestic policy, it has usually meant that two or three people come on board from the other side of the aisle. The era when Republican Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen could bring over 20 or more colleagues for legislation proposed by a Democratic president, back in the 1960s, seems long gone. The virtue of bipartisan deals is that they create bills that are more durable over time and have the imprint of a broader portion of the American public. Bipartisan votes on legislation demonstrate that support for a bill is not red or blue, but red, white and blue. Americans already making big decisions over cliff . A budget deal could show that it is possible to have responsible partisanship. In recent decades, public debate has revolved around whether it is better to have a partisan divide, where Democrats and Republicans offer voters clear alternatives, or bipartisanship, where both sides find areas of agreement. The alternate path is responsible partisanship, whereby the parties are willing to sign onto bills where each loses something significant. They must abide by Senator Dirksen's maxim: ""I am a man of fixed and unbending principles, the first of which is to be flexible at all times."" Responsible partisanship would offer voters the best of both worlds -- a partisan system with the capacity for governance. So the budget deal can be a big deal, not only for the nation but also for restoring public trust in Congress. If Congress fails to reach a deal on its own, or if it tries to kick the issue down the road by extending the deadline, the chances are that the terrible perceptions of the legislative branch will only get worse. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Avoiding the fiscal cliff could be a moment of truth for Congress, says Julian Zelizer .

"(CNN) -- President Obama is set to deliver the first State of the Union Address of his new term. On Tuesday evening, he will step before a joint session of Congress and a nation in difficult times. Unemployment rose in January to 7.9%. There are signs of economic progress, but millions of Americans are struggling to find a job while others are desperate to keep the one they have. Other kinds of economic challenges face many people. The Pew Research Center recently released a study showing the growing number of adults who are struggling to support grown children and their parents, the ""Sandwich Generation"" as they are called. The economy is just the tip of the iceberg. The issue of immigration needs to be resolved soon. Too many immigrants live in a state of constant uncertainty about their future, or that of their children. The tensions in this debate are heightened by the fact that state and local governments are struggling to find enough revenue to pay for crucial services such as education. The climate also remains in peril, as the wild weather patterns of the past year have shown. At the same time, Americans are still reeling from the deadly shooting incidents that have caused horrible bloodshed in movie theaters and schools and waiting to see what Washington does, or does not do, about guns. Then there are the countless foreign policy challenges we face. The State of the Union address gives President Obama a prime opportunity to lay out what he intends to do in the year ahead to guide the nation through these difficult challenges. Although there are limits to how much these speeches can change public opinion, especially in an age of partisan polarization where large segments of the electorate are hard to move, it still is a vital moment where he can help shape the agenda for the coming year and outline some key themes for public discussion. John King: Speech may do little to change Washington . It may be tempting to list a series of measures Obama wants Congress to pass, but the president should use this speech to do something more than provide a laundry list, and the historical record offers some guidance about how. The speech can offer a vision. In 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt gave one of the most historic State of the Union addresses when he outlined the Four Freedoms. He delivered his speech on the brink of America becoming involved in World War II. With Europe and Asia in the middle of a major military crisis, FDR defined the four freedoms that he believed should be the foundation of the international system: the freedom of speech and expression, the freedom to worship God, the freedom from want and, finally, the freedom from fear. ""That is no vision of a distant millennium. It is a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in our own time and generation,"" FDR said. ""That kind of world is the very antithesis of the so-called new order of tyranny which the dictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb."" The speech was inspirational and offered a moral blueprint for the United States, both in its efforts at home and abroad for decades to come. If President Obama wants to sketch a set of legislative goals, he might look to President Johnson. In 1965, LBJ was fresh off his landslide victory against Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater and he managed to outline a breathtaking agenda, offering proposals for government to expand its role in all walks of life, from education to health care to the environment. This was all part of the Great Society, a vision that Johnson had outlined a few months earlier at the University of Michigan but which came to life during the State of the Union address. ""The Great Society asks not how much,"" Johnson said, ""but how good; not only how to create wealth but how to use it; not only how fast we are going, but where we are headed."" Sometimes the State of the Union address can be an opportunity for a president to take a risk, to set out an objective for the nation that might be controversial or might look impossible at the time, but which challenges Congress and the citizens to repair broken parts of society. In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln, with America in the Civil War, insisted that the freedom of the slave was essential to the restoration of the union. ""We—even we here—hold the power, and bear the responsibility. In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free—honorable alike in what we give, and what we preserve."" The speech can also be a moment for honesty. One speech that often receives attention in top 10 lists is President Gerald Ford's State of the Union address in 1975. Ford is an unlikely candidate for any historic list, as he took over from Richard Nixon after his resignation and wouldn't be re-elected in 1976. Ford governed in difficult economic times -- the nation was hit by the twin shock of inflation and unemployment, which came to be known as stagflation. When Ford went on the air, he was brutally honest. The state of the nation, he said, ""is not good."" Ford proceeded to outline what Americans were facing. ""Millions of Americans are out of work. Recession and inflation are eroding the money of millions more. Prices are too high, and sales are too slow."" While presidents usually like to use these speeches to make Americans feel good about where they are, President Obama might think about speaking straight to a nation frustrated with a new normal of stagnant growth, where politicians talk about economic improvement even as the workforce continually struggles with high rates of unemployment and economic insecurity. While Americans want a leader who can point a path forward, they also want to know that the person in the White House truly understands the pain many are suffering. In his first State of the Union address, delivered in January 2010, President Obama stressed his promise to help the middle class and to fix the broken political process in Washington. ""We face a deficit of trust,"" he said. In his second address, delivered after the Republicans had taken over the House and in the wake of the horrific shooting of Rep. Gabby Giffords, President Obama again appealed to the desire for unity. He also called on Congress to support a legislative package that would allow the United States to regain its competitive edge. In January 2012, Obama, highlighted the differences between the parties—the choice Americans would face in the upcoming election--by calling on Congress to support investments in education, infrastructure and clean energy. He warned that growing economic inequality threatened the future of the middle class. ""We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well,"" he said, ""while a growing number of Americans barely get by or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules."" This time around, the president should think big, not necessarily about how much he wants to propose, but about the vision and ideas he wants to put forth to move the United States forward. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer .","Julian Zelizer: Obama delivers first State of the Union of second term .

"(CNN) -- Republicans have been engaged in a lot of soul searching since the election. There are many reasons that they were not happy about the outcome of the election, but most frightening of all for the party was the fact that demographic changes and public opinion on social issues like gay marriage and abortion seem opposed to the party's stances. ""I went to bed last night thinking we've lost the country,"" said radio host Rush Limbaugh. To be sure, Republicans did well with large swaths of white voters and much of the map remained red. Yet Republicans clearly had trouble attracting Latinos, African Americans, Asians, women, younger college-educated voters or working class voters in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. Polls show that Republicans are out of step with where most Americans are when it comes to the big social and cultural issues of the day. Many voters felt that the GOP looked stale while Democrats, even after four years with President Obama in the White House, looked like the party that was fresh and moving in a forward direction. The question that many are asking is whether it is possible for the Republicans to really remake their image, to sell themselves as a different kind of party that speaks to the future and not the past? The answer from history is yes. Between 1928 and 1936 Democrats redefined themselves from a party that appealed primarily to urban machine voters and Southern rural voters into a national party that represented a broad coalition of industrial workers, progressive business leaders, university experts, farmers, immigrants and African Americans. The coalition would endure for decades, sustaining the party into the 1970s. Jindal: How Republicans can win the future . Republicans remade their image between 1974 and 1984 by scrapping the image of their party that had been seen as corrupt after the Watergate scandal as well as a party that had little to say to younger generations of Americans. In the late 1970s and during Ronald Reagan's presidency, the GOP became the exciting party of the future, bringing together a coalition of the religious right, neoconservatives, Southerners, financial and business leaders, and ""Reagan Democrats"" who bolted with their party. In each case, the parties made a number of crucial moves that were vital to the transformation. Investing in the world of ideas helped give the parties some intellectual firepower. Franklin D. Roosevelt drew on some of the best and brightest social scientists, most evident in his Brains Trust, that introduced into the campaigns and Washington new programs for dealing with pressing social problems. During the 1970s conservatives invested huge resources in creating new think tanks, to counteract liberal institutions like Brookings, and nurturing conservative intellectuals in the universities, all of whom contributed to the strength of Ronald Reagan's arguments about deregulation, supply side economics and fighting communism. The next important step was to figure out ways to pick off key parts of the electoral base of the opposition, which was in some ways central symbolically to demonstrating that the electoral winds had shifted. Frum: Can GOP handle prosperity? During the 1930s, FDR did well with African Americans as well as some Midwestern progressives, both constituencies that had made their home in the GOP until that time. But FDR demonstrated that he was the candidate better prepared to fulfill their ambitions. Reagan did the same with Southerners who had been so loyal to the GOP as well as with neoconservative Democrats who were frustrated with their older party's foreign policies. FDR and Reagan themselves were also central to the story. In the 1930s and 1980s, having a charismatic and transformative leader who could define the party, and not just represent it, helped shift how people felt about these political leaders. During the 1930s immigrants hung pictures of FDR in their saloons and Americans listened on pins and needles to every word he said on his ""fireside chats."" Reagan also proved hugely popular even with voters who were not fully comfortable with his views. Today, Republicans need to find a little of all these things if they want to make a serious push to move forward. In the search of a compelling agenda, they will need to nurture new intellectual voices like Yuval Levin at National Affairs. They will need to move forward on immigration reform which gives them the best chance to pick off some of the voters who brought Obama into office. They will need to challenge some of their own orthodoxies in an effort to move forward on big policy challenges as U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Georgia, recently suggested when he took aim at Grover Norquist. ""I care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old pledge,"" he said with regard to the now famous promise, organized by Norquist, never to raise taxes. Others in the party, including Sen. Lindsey Graham and Rep. Peter King, agreed with Chambliss. They will need to find a leader, unlike any in the pack in recent years, who can shine on the campaign trail and who has the capacity to give the GOP a new brand name rather than just convincing voters to dutifully vote the party line. Transformation is possible, but not easy. Unless the GOP can take these kinds of steps it will continually struggle to retain the segments of the vote it already has, while ceding even more ground to the Democrats. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Republicans are debating their future after a disappointing election .

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- As Democrats struggle to retain control of the Senate and retake control of the House, they are searching for issues to frame their campaigns. This is not easy, since the Democrats are in a difficult position. With President Obama's low approval ratings, Democratic candidates won't want to focus on his record. With the economy likely to still be in laggard condition, Democrats won't be able to boast that it's morning in America. With economic concerns front and center for most Americans, Democrats won't be able to make much headway with talk about the foreign policy successes of this administration. A number of retirements, including that of Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank, have made the campaign even more challenging for the party. This doesn't leave candidates with many options. Although some could focus on local issues, they will be under pressure to develop a national theme since Republican candidates will be talking critically about Obama. So what might Democrats talk about? The most potent theme that the party has to offer is the issue of fairness. Democrats can claim that as Americans struggle to survive in this economy, the party has championed policies that aim to soften the blows voters are suffering and to provide support for the middle class in hard times. This is a familiar strategy for the Democratic Party. During the 1930s, according to the historian Lizabeth Cohen, the Democratic Party fought for a vision of moral capitalism whereby government and other institutions, such as unions, would lessen some of the suffering that could be inflicted in the free-market economy. During his acceptance speech at the 1936 Democratic convention, President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, ""Today we stand committed to the proposition that freedom is no half-and-half affair. If the average citizen is guaranteed equal opportunity in the polling place, he must have equal opportunity in the market place. These economic royalists (his opponents on Wall Street and in the business community) complain that we seek to overthrow the institutions of America. What they really complain of is that we seek to take away their power."" Fast forward to the 1982 midterm elections, when Democrats expanded the size of their majority in the House by 26 seats. The economy was suffering from a horrible recession. Republicans, who controlled the White House and Senate, took the blame. Democrats spent their campaigns talking about fairness and the unwillingness of President Ronald Reagan to support policies that did not privilege upper-income taxpayers and corporations. While Reagan spoke about the virtues of supply-side economics, House Speaker Tip O'Neill held hearings to bring attention to this issue. Rep. Peter Rodino said, ""Every American who cares about other Americans, who cares about civil rights and equal opportunity, who cares about clean air and clean water, who cares about poor people and old people and helpless people, ought to care about the 1982 House elections."" He warned that ""These wolves in wolves' clothing -- ultra-conservative ideologues, religious fanatics, corporate fat cats, reborn Reaganites, the single-issue zealots -- are shoving traditional Republicans out the back door of their own party."" The 2012 election is obviously much different from any in the 1930s or 1982. Nonetheless there are three issues through which Democrats have an opportunity to build on this theme. The first is taxes. Republicans have pushed for Congress to extend President George W. Bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Even though taking this step would only aggravate the deficit problem, the GOP has stood firm. At the same time, congressional Republicans have made it difficult to extend the payroll tax holiday that has benefited lower and middle income workers. Many Senate Republicans rebuffed their own leadership by voting against extending the cut. Other Republicans are bending, but slowly and after a lot of complaint. The optics could work against them. These tax positions create room for Democrats to challenge Republicans as being more supportive of helping the wealthy than average Americans. The accusations have already started. ""Scott Brown is ready to raise taxes on middle-class families already struggling to get back on their feet in order to protect millionaires and billionaires,"" said John Walsh, the Massachusetts Democratic Party chairman, in a comment about the senator, who is facing a challenge from Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren. The second issue has been unemployment insurance. Throughout the past four years, Republicans have presented roadblocks to the extension of these benefits even as Americans have struggled with extraordinarily difficult economic challenges. Republicans have grudgingly accepted these extensions in exchange for other sorts of measures. While many Americans don't like government, many understand and support the need for temporary assistance as people try to make ends meet. This is an area where Democrats can talk about a specific policy and win support for spending from an electorate that might be philosophically opposed to big government. Finally there is health care, an issue that is likely to be part of the campaign if the Supreme Court issues a ruling on the constitutionality of the law before the election. The debate over health care has ranged around a number of issues including the mandate and health care exchanges. But one of the biggest contributions of the program is to extend health insurance to over 30 million Americans who don't have it. Fairness is the theme that offers a struggling Democratic Party the best opportunity to improve its standing in Congress. Some Democrats have already begun to outline the message. According to The Hill, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer explained that ""Simply attacking the wealthy is a bad idea. Saying the wealthy have to do their fair share is the right idea."" Unless economic conditions change dramatically, Democratic congressional candidates will be in a precarious position, even with the unhappiness about the GOP. Republicans at least have Obama as a straw man around which to build their campaigns. Democrats need their own theme. Focusing on Republican obstruction is one alternative, but more appealing might be a message and vision for dealing with the sluggish economic recovery in the coming years.

"(CNN) -- Herman Cain, the surprise candidate of 2012, has been struggling to survive accusations of sexual harassment. Every day that the story continues and new accusations emerge, Cain's candidacy is at greater risk. Yet thus far his polls have remained steady, and the news cycle seems to be turning toward other issues. Cain has denied the accusations and pushed back against the accusers. Cain is far from the first presidential candidate to struggle with a scandal centered on sex. Sex scandals have a long tradition in American politics. In the presidential campaigns of 1824 and 1828, opponents accused Andrew Jackson of adultery, while in 1884 Republicans lambasted Grover Cleveland for his illegitimate child. Supporters of Cleveland's opponent, James Blaine, liked to chant ""Ma, Ma, where's my pa?"" whenever they had a chance. During the first seven decades of the 20th century, sex scandals played a diminished role on the campaign trail. The news media exhibited remarkable restraint, as reporters stayed within boundaries defining what kind of behavior was appropriate -- or relevant -- to report and what was not. The rules governing behavior at the workplace were also extraordinarily lax, and reporters, like other Americans, didn't expect men to meet a high standard in treating the women around them. Despite widespread knowledge of President John F. Kennedy's sexual escapades and Sen. Russell Long's alcoholism, reporters declined to write stories about their behavior. According to the legendary reporter Jack Germond, a politician who chased after women was gently characterized as a man who appreciated a well-turned ankle. But that changed in the 1970s. A new generation of reporters, inspired by the Watergate investigation, was eager to expose the next big scandal in Washington. In recent years, the proliferation of news outlets, ranging from cable television to the Internet, has created intense competition to report the most salacious stories. Public norms on sexuality have liberalized and the media have grown more comfortable reporting about sex. Moreover, liberals argue that the private behavior of public officials matters. New sexual harassment laws have changed the norms of what is considered acceptable at the workplace. Conservatives are more eager to highlight personal behavior as they hope to to make morality a legitimate issue in public debate. Sometimes sex scandals have brought down promising candidates. During the 1987 Democratic primaries for president, for example, the Miami Herald reported that Gary Hart, a former Colorado senator, was having an affair with a young model. Hart challenged the media to prove their allegations. Soon after, the National Enquirer obtained photographs of a model named Donna Rice sitting on Hart's lap on a yacht named Monkey Business. Once the pictures were published, Hart dropped out of the race. Yet often candidates have been able to survive these accusations. Sex scandals are not necessarily devastating to a candidacy. During Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign, allegations that he had had an affair with Gennifer Flowers broke right before the crucial New Hampshire primary. Clinton effectively responded by appearing with his wife, Hillary, on CBS's ""60 Minutes."" He went on to win the presidency and earn high approval ratings. The future of Herman Cain remains unclear: Will he suffer the fate of Gary Hart or succeed as Bill Clinton did? There are several reasons that, at least initially, Cain has been able to survive the frenzy. The first is a certain numbness that Americans have to ongoing stories about the poor behavior of politicians. We live in a cynical age when Americans don't expect much from their leaders. Scandals can certainly destroy political futures, as was the case with Rep. Anthony Weiner or two-time presidential candidate John Edwards, but there is an equal chance that the public won't find a particular case all that shocking. (In the cases of Weiner and Edwards, their initial denials were proven wrong; in Cain's case, the truth of the accusations hasn't been established.) The second reason is that partisanship has become so intense these days that there is naturally going to be suspicion that charges such as these might come from political opponents. Cain has played into this belief by accusing his political opponents, ranging from Gov. Rick Perry's campaign to liberals, of being behind the charges. Cain also might survive this scandal because this story has emerged so long before any voting starts. The Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary are months away, and the opinions of voters won't be definitively known till then. Even if party leaders put pressure on Cain, they'll have limited effect, given that Cain is not part of the party establishment. He doesn't really care what the leaders of the GOP have to say. That's in fact the point of his campaign. In that sense, he is very much like Ross Perot in Republican clothes. None of this is to say that Herman Cain is safe. The fact is that if stories about his alleged misbehavior continue to emerge, and the substance of more of these accusations becomes public, the real power brokers in modern campaigns -- the fundraisers and campaign donors -- will make a decision for him. They will turn off the spigot of money that he would need to make his campaign real. This is the ultimate check on his future. Republicans are extremely anxious. They sense a real opportunity to win this election and don't have much stomach for picking someone who could implode in the general election come September 2012. Given his inexperience in the political realm, Cain is already a high-risk candidate. A few more accusations and his candidacy could come to an early end. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Herman Cain's campaign has so far survived accusations of sexual harassment .

"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton could be an excellent presidential candidate for the Democrats in 2016. After suffering through an extremely difficult loss in the primaries against Barack Obama, Clinton has managed to strengthen her resume. As secretary of state, she improved her standing on foreign policy and earned more respect among Democrats who had been skeptical of her positions ever since her vote on the resolution to authorize force in Iraq in 2002. The press has been showering praise on Clinton in recent months. Even though the next presidential election is more than three years away, there have been numerous stories about how Clinton can dominate the nomination process. Polls show that she comes out ahead of most Democrats as well as prominent Republicans, such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. One poll conducted by the Washington Post found that 67% of Americans have a favorable view of Clinton. The Ready for Hillary super PAC has already launched its website. ""We are going to keep up the energy and excitement surrounding her potential candidacy,"" said the PAC's chairwoman, Allida Black. There have even been articles about why she is not the inevitable candidate, the kind of discussion that only tends to fuel the perception that she is at the top of the heap. Bill Clinton hints at run for Hillary . But Clinton needs to be careful. In 2008, Barack Obama turned Clinton's experience as first lady and senator into a liability. Back then, Clinton was also seen as the experienced candidate who would inevitably win the nomination. When Clinton won the New Hampshire primary after a stunning loss in Iowa, many reporters credited her experience. Clinton did not back away from this image. ""I put forth my lifetime of experience,"" she said. ""Senator Obama will put forth a speech he made in 2002."" Sensing the mood of the Democratic electorate, Obama capitalized on the fact that he was not a Washington insider. He aggressively attacked Clinton by depicting her as the quintessential politician who was shaped by the Beltway, someone who voters could not trust to keep her word, and a Democrat who would certainly disappoint loyal members of the party by sticking to the status quo. While Clinton's supporters boasted that no other candidate matched her skills, with each Obama victory, the press became more excited about the unexpected turn in the contest. Obama did what Jimmy Carter did in 1976, when he took on Washington heavyweights such as Henry ""Scoop"" Jackson and Morris Udall by making experience a bad word. Ronald Reagan did the same to his Republican opponents in 1980, including George H.W. Bush, whose sterling record turned into a huge liability with primary voters. In an era when voters distrust the government, they can often see value in the person with less experience in the system. And in an era when reporters cover elections like horse races, the underdog is often the most exciting person to write about. Of course, Clinton was anything but ""just"" a Washington insider. That image was as much the creation of her opponent's political campaign as her own. Opinion: Hillary Clinton, a mistake for 2016 . Her campaign could easily have depicted her as someone who would be a fresh voice in Washington -- the first female president, a person who had struggled to make the role of the first lady something bigger, a fighter who had taken on the aggressive conservative establishment, even as her husband betrayed her before the public eye. While in the Senate, Clinton displayed remarkable skills at winning over support among many skeptics, including Republicans who had once fought to impeach her husband. Yes, this is about experience in Washington, but her success was also a considerable asset that few politicians possess. With all the praise that is being showered on her potential candidacy, it's easy to see Clinton facing the same challenges if she decides to run in 2016. Clinton will have to remember the lessons of 2008. Clinton certainly deserves all the positive coverage, but she can't let it define her. For if she does decide to declare her candidacy, there might be so little excitement left by the time that it is made that the media will turn their attention to any fresh voice, such as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is an extremely potent politician. The narrative that campaigns tell about a candidate plays a huge role in the outcome of a contest. Clinton has an impressive story to tell. She has championed women's rights for decades. She embodies the drive for female equality by shattering many glass ceilings. She has deep political experiences at home and abroad. More than anyone at the moment, she has the potential to be America's female president. If she runs, Clinton needs to make sure that her Democratic as well as Republican opponents don't turn her strength into a weakness once again. Clinton needs to find the right balance between selling her experiences and skills and keeping the excitement that her candidacy could bring to a Democratic ticket. She needs to sell the message that her candidacy is distinct and historic. And if she could bring enthusiastic and idealistic supporters to the ballot box just as Obama was able to do, then she has a chance to truly make history.

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- American voters need to decide what they really want from Washington. On the one hand, voters are dismissive of presidential and congressional candidates who can be called ""flip-floppers,"" people who shift positions or agree to compromise. On the other hand, voters rail against a dysfunctional Washington that seems unable to reach agreement on almost anything because politicians on the right and left don't seem willing to compromise . As a result, the approval ratings of Congress have fallen to only 9%. Voters insist they want the type of candidate who won't compromise, and thus won't be able to cut the deals that are needed to break through the partisan gridlock. Indeed, the term flip-flopper has become one of the dirtiest words in American politics. When candidates have a record that reveals inconsistencies in their position, their opponents pounce. In 2004, President George W. Bush's campaign eviscerated Democratic presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry through a devastating campaign that focused on this point. In one television ad, Republicans showed Kerry windsurfing, arguing that this was a metaphor for his approach to politics. The narrator stated: ""In which direction would John Kerry lead? Kerry voted for the Iraq war, opposed it, supported it and now opposes it again. ... John Kerry: whichever way the wind blows."" Right now the top candidates in both parties are viewed by many voters as flip-floppers. For some liberal Democrats, one of the biggest problems with President Obama has been that he has governed too much like President Bill Clinton. Rather than standing on principle, he has made deals. The president has consistently reached out to centrists and has been willing to accept the best that he could get, rather than challenging his opponents to a tough fight. On the other side of the aisle, there is former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the front-runner who Republicans love to hate. His critics argue he is a politician willing to stand for anything that will get him elected. They point to positions he has taken a stand on, issues such as abortion, health care and gay rights, and note how he later changed his stance for political expediency. In response to a question during one of the Republican debates, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said, ""I think Americans just don't know sometimes which Mitt Romney they're dealing with."" Erick Erickson, a CNN contributor and editor of redstate.com, wrote, ""Mitt Romney is not the George W. Bush of 2012 -- he is the Harriet Miers of 2012, only conservative because a few conservative grand pooh-bahs tell us Mitt Romney is conservative and for no other reason."" Even before the GOP nomination battle is decided, President Obama's surrogates such as David Plouffe are already attacking Romney as a flip-flopper. The critics of Obama and Romney are picking up on the fact that voters react negatively to candidates who shift their positions. And there are forces in both parties that are pushing for the kind of candidate who will stand firmly on principle and not negotiate with the other side. Yet if these are the ideals that we demand of our elected officials, it will certainly be more difficult to solve America's problems. There seems to be no room any more for politicians like Sen. Everett Dirksen. The Illinois Republican and Senate Minority Leader in the 1960s was a striking figure. With his baritone voice and wavy white hair, Dirksen was a memorable politician who passionately believed in the art of compromise and was often willing to cut a deal. Indeed, his critics often complained that he was all compromise and no principle. One southern Democrat refused to join a birthday celebration for Dirksen, explaining, ""He is a delightful companion, but he changes too often for me. I never know where he is."" Dirksen didn't really care. He liked to quote Emerson as saying ""consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds,"" believing the job of the legislator was to find or shape bills that could pass. As a result, he was able to make bold moves to make legislative deals even when they defied some of the core ideals of his party. Dirksen, for example, was instrumental in ending the filibuster against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. With Southern Democrats opposing the bill, the White House depended on him to deliver enough votes to reach the 67 required to end debate and bring the bill to a vote. He delivered. Though he was not a champion of civil rights, Dirksen emerged as a towering figure on Capitol Hill as a result of this and other deals. Dirksen was not alone. Some of the most successful presidents of the 20th century didn't practice what they preached. President Franklin Roosevelt was notoriously difficult to pin down, embracing programs that appealed to the left and the right, such as cutting government spending in 1933 while expanding the regulatory power of Washington at the same time. President Ronald Reagan is often praised for having negotiated a historic agreement with the Soviet Union in 1987, even though he had spent much of his career railing against other Republicans and Democrats who were willing to sit down and talk with the Kremlin. Of course we don't want presidents and legislators who stand for nothing and simply move whichever way the wind blows. But flexibility and pragmatism are virtues as well. If we are to fix Washington, the city needs more figures like Dirksen, FDR, and Reagan, individuals who love the craft of politics and the art of making deals. But if the nation insists on electing politicians who have a pure partisan track record, compromise will be hard, if not impossible, to achieve. At some level, Americans will have to come to learn to love the flip-flopper if they really want to end the legislative stalemate we've seen for more than a decade. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: American voters want candidates who aren't flip-floppers .

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- The stakes in the current budget battles are enormous. As the super-committee deliberates over how to reduce the deficit and other congressional committees struggle to cut spending, the fate of important programs hangs in the balance. While the American public tends to focus on the highest profile issues such as Medicare and defense, some of the smaller, off-radar issues are also vital and can't be ignored. The combination of rising deficits, hyper-partisanship, and tea party conservatism has put numerous policies at risk. One of the programs that could suffer is the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, otherwise known as PEPFAR. It is one of the less well known creations of President George W. Bush. Started in 2003, the program began by providing $15 billion over five years to combat AIDS around the globe through testing, counseling and medical treatment. The amount initially spent was over three times what the nation had spent on this cause before. President Bush, who believed the idea was like the Marshall Plan, a U.S. program in 1948 that provided economic assistance to Western Europe to help in reconstructing the continent after World War II and prevent the spread of communism, said: ""When we see a plague leaving graves and orphans across a continent, we must act. When we see the wounded on the road to Jericho, we will not -- America will not -- pass to the other side of the road."" Some, including Democrats who don't care for the rest of his record, believe that it is his greatest accomplishment. Though the U.S. foreign aid program, where PEPFAR is housed, constitutes less than 1% of the federal budget, it has helped to save the lives of millions of people and helped to contain a disease that was ravaging the African continent. By 2009, a study in the Annals of Internal Medicine reported that in African countries receiving PEPFAR funding there had been a 10.5% reduction in the AIDS death rate. The program has been extended under President Obama. To be sure, it has not been without controversy. Some liberals complained the program pushed for ineffective abstinence measures, to please the religious right, while some conservatives viewed it as a an unneeded expenditure. But in general, it has been considered an example of policy success in an era when Americans love to criticize government. What happens next is uncertain. With Democrats and Republicans focusing on massive foreign aid cuts as part of a deficit deal, with some estimates upward of $60 billion, the State Department would be unlikely to continue with humanitarian programs such as these for very long. Proposals to cut this humanitarian spending, noted Charles Lyons, the president of the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, are ""very, very concerning and comes at exactly the wrong time."" Lyons added that the program has been a ""game changer."" In August, the U.S. government announced that anti-retroviral AIDS medicines could reduce the transmission of the disease from infected to non-infected partners by 96%. Moreover, the United Nations program on HIV/AIDs announced a plan to eliminate pediatric AIDS infections by 2015. The plan explains that, ""It is possible to stop new HIV infections among children and keep their mothers alive if pregnant women living with HIV and their children have timely access to quality life-saving anti-retroviral drugs."" The moral weight behind the program becomes clearer in a riveting new documentary by first-time filmmaker Maggie Betts, whose movie, ""The Carrier,"" premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. The movie follows the struggles of a Zambian woman named Mutinta Mweemba who has become pregnant. Mutinta, who was trapped in a polygamous marriage, learns that she has AIDS. The film follows her effort to protect her child from acquiring the disease as well. One of the most striking aspects of the film is the network of health care workers who come into her life, providing counsel and medicine, seeking to prevent the transfer of the disease to the children. Now, Congress will have to make a decision about whether to increase funds for PEPFAR, whether to reduce its funds or even keep the program alive. Although this program is one of the longest lasting creations of President Bush, many younger Republicans are not supportive of it. House Republicans, moved to the right by the tea party, have little appetite for spending on anything that does not seem to be absolutely essential to the nation. In 2008, when she voted against the re-authorization of PEPFAR, Michelle Bachmann said, ""The United States is the most generous nation on earth. We have to have a balancing act between our benevolence and our prosperity. And our prosperity today is at risk. We will not survive if our benevolence allows the treasury to not only be empty -- but to have us be a debtor nation greater than we have ever been before."" But before Congress takes action, America would do well to consider the kinds of transformative impact that government can have. When a program does work, as the evidence suggests that PEPFAR has, and is desperately needed, there should be some kind of security for its future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Washington's budget-cutting endangers some worthy programs .

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- Newt Gingrich's candidacy received an unexpected boost when New Hampshire's Union Leader endorsed him this weekend. The publisher wrote: ""We are in critical need of the innovative, forward-looking strategy and positive leadership that Gingrich has shown he is capable of providing. He did so with the Contract with America. He did it in bringing in the first Republican House in 40 years and by forging balanced budgets and even a surplus despite the political challenge of dealing with a Democratic President."" Say what you will about Gingrich, but he thrives when it comes to the politics of ideas. Gingrich, a former history professor, is extraordinarily comfortable when it comes to vigorous and open debates about the ideas of conservatism. Rarely satisfied with the status quo, Gingrich likes to try pushing the boundaries of what his party stands for. ""People overvalue money and undervalue ideas,"" Gingrich recently told one newspaper. ""That's part of the core gamble of this campaign. I actually think ideas matter."" His candidacy comes at a time when Republicans have not devoted much time to intellectual introspection. For decades, the party became comfortable with the privileges of power. Republicans spent more time focusing on how they wanted to use their power and protect their political position than on talking about the ideas that the party stood for. The Republican loss of control of Congress in 2006 and horrendous approval ratings of President George W. Bush in 2008 led many conservatives to demand that the party reinvent itself from the grass roots up. Yet the tea party movement has had trouble finding national politicians who were interested, or capable of doing the intellectual legwork that revitalization would require. In certain respects, Gingrich fits the bill. The Georgian entered the national scene in the 1970s, an era when Republicans had no other choice but to pay attention to their core principles. Democrats had controlled Congress since 1952 and liberal ideas dominated the worlds of think tanks, academia and journalism. From the perspective of conservatives, the only modern Republicans who had been elected to the White House before 1980 -- Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon -- were essentially Democrats-Lite. Gerald Ford, also far too moderate in their view, was an accidental president. So Gingrich and other Republicans set out to remake the Republican Party. Attracted by the vibrant conservative movement, Gingrich tapped into the ideas put forth by conservative intellectuals about supply-side economics, deregulation, and anti-communism. Although President Ronald Reagan was mocked by some as an actor in the White House who followed his script, Reagan was like Gingrich in that he spent much of his early adulthood deeply immersed in journals such as Human Events and in reading some of the prominent thinkers of the time. Throughout the 1970s, this generation of conservatives took ideas seriously. They established think tanks such as CATO Institute and financed academic scholarship about conservatism. Elected to the House in 1978, Gingrich adopted an unusual political style that mixed the promotion of conservative ideas with hard-nosed political tactics. He used his positions in the House opposition to champion the ideas of the conservative movement, while employing aggressive tactics to challenge Democrats. Gingrich went on C-SPAN and accused Democrats of being weak against communism. He used the new ethics rules instituted in the 1970s to bring down Speaker James Wright in 1989. In 1994, Gingrich was the key person behind the Contract with America, a 10-point platform for what the GOP would do if it retook control of Congress. While simplistic and a public relations gimmick, it did send the message to voters in 1994 that the GOP would be about more than power and patronage. Rather, its candidates would come to Washington seeking to pursue a series of ideas about government. Gingrich never had much luck in leadership positions. Once he was speaker of the House, his career took a downward turn. He had trouble adjusting to the position of being a leader. Colleagues joked that 70% of Gingrich could be president, while the other 30% explained why he was not. Gingrich proved unable to tame members of his own party and to bring about a deal. His difficulty controlling what he said in front of the media led to embarrassing moments, such as when he was mocked as a ""cry baby"" for having complained that President Bill Clinton didn't speak to him on Air Force One on the trip to Israel for the funeral of Yitzhak Rabin (though the White House released pictures showing that he did) and that he had to exit the rear of the plane. In the end, as the partisan wars led to the House decision to impeach Clinton, Gingrich was forced to step aside as a result of his own affair, his ethics violations, and the poor results of the 1998 midterms. While it is unlikely that Gingrich, with his personal baggage and lack of discipline, will survive the caucuses and primaries, he could offer Republicans a useful boost in the coming months. Thus far much of the competition among the Republican candidates has been remarkably stale, revolving around the rise and fall of quirky personalities or around debates about who is most likely to beat President Obama. While all of these are valid and predictable issues for this stage of the campaign, they don't offer much to inspire. As was evident in Tuesday's debate on national security, Gingrich doesn't mind shaking things up. He'll challenge the Republican orthodoxy on immigration and raise questions about how the party should handle challenges such as health care. He will stimulate other candidates to join in these kinds of debates, thinking through what the party should stand for. This would help them make a more compelling case to voters for their candidacy -- beyond simply not being Obama. This is especially important amid the dysfunction in government that keeps Washington from doing much about anything. The idea man has an important role in American politics, even if he himself is unable to win office. Gingrich fills that role, giving Republicans a candidate who is thinking more seriously about what the party is trying to accomplish and how to command the loyalty of voters for years to come.

"(CNN) -- The critics are raving about Steven Spielberg's new film ""Lincoln."" A.O. Scott of the New York Times called it ""among the finest films ever made about American politics."" Viewers get a taste of the legislative process up close by watching how President Abraham Lincoln rounded up the necessary votes in get the 13th Amendment resolution through the House. Viewers see a master at work -- a president who knew how to break through the various divisions in Congress and outflank his opponents. Review: 'Lincoln' brilliantly dramatizes delicacy of politics . Movies such as Spielberg's often result in inflated expectations about what a president could achieve in the current political environment. The reality is that even the best presidents would have trouble rounding up votes in the contemporary Congress. As the nation continues to be obsessed with a sex scandal involving top military officials and as the lame-duck Congress figures out what to do about the fiscal cliff, Washington would do well to think seriously about how government reform might improve the basic machinery of the federal government so that elected officials are better able to handle the big issues of the day such as unemployment, immigration, climate change and more. Reform must start with reining in the power of money and organized interest groups. Campaign finance reform, once a promise of President Barack Obama in 2008, has taken a back seat even though the president made some progress on reforming lobbying early in his term. Unless Congress does more to prevent the revolving door between Capitol Hill and K Street and limit the power of private money in campaigns, it will be difficult to change the status quo. With more than $6 billion spent on the recent election, elected officials will have to maneuver around donors who were essential to both sides of the campaign and who will be expecting access when the new year begins. Then there is the filibuster, which currently requires a supermajority on most pieces of legislation given that the congressional minority has been willing to use this mechanism with ruthless abandon. Since 2007, according to the Senate Historical Office, there were more than 360 Republican filibusters. When Congress reconvenes in early 2013, it will have one shot to change the rules so that the threshold for passing a filibuster is lowered. In January 2009, lawmakers let the opportunity slip away. The chronic use of the filibuster threat has been one of the central culprits behind dysfunction as the congressional minority has immense power to block progress. But it's not just Congress that has to step up its act. The White House, for example, needs to curtail one of the legacies of Lincoln that has often caused friction with Congress and circumvented the kind of the checks and balances we depend on: executive power. Throughout the 20th century, and especially in recent decades, presidents routinely employ executive power, such as signing statements, to circumvent the will of Congress. Obama, who started his term critical of how President George W. Bush had employed this authority, has started to replicate his predecessor. The president used executive power to conduct national security operations as well as to strengthen environmental regulations. ""I refuse to take 'no' for an answer,"" Obama said, ""When Congress refuses to act and -- as a result -- hurts our economy and puts people at risk, I have an obligation as president to do what I can without them."" The problem with executive power is that it results in policies that can easily be overturned and which rarely have bipartisan support. It also sets a precedent for the president to erode legislative power. Recently, in a wonderful play at my children's school, the students put on a show about how a bill becomes a law. The play begins with protest that unfolds when a group of parents want to impose a candy tax on their children after they collect their Halloween treats. The president, moved by the protesters, sends this proposal to Congress. After a committee drafts the legislation, the House of Representatives passes the measure, as does the Senate. But soon after, the Supreme Court declares the bill to be unconstitutional. As my wife and I watched two of our children star in the play, we could not help but think about what the teachers decided to leave out of the script. What parts of our political process are sanitized when we translate them into a production for children? There was no talk of lobbyists, filibusters and executive power. As the new Congress gets ready to reconvene in January, this is the time to consider reform. If we want to reach the high moments captured in Spielberg's film about Lincoln, we need to make sure our political process, albeit difficult, works. Otherwise dysfunction will rule.

"(CNN) -- Nobody likes politicians. Ever since Jimmy Carter won his way to the White House in 1976 by assuring voters that they could trust him in contrast to the more experienced opponents he faced, both Republican and Democratic candidates have tended to boast about every part of their resume that can distinguish themselves from the Washington status quo. In 2008, then-Sen. Barack Obama undercut the ""inevitable"" Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by running as the candidate who was the least corrupted by the bargaining ways of Capitol Hill. Through its portrayal of Sen. John McCain's selection of Sarah Palin, the HBO film ""Game Change"" effectively captures just how far political candidates are willing to go to have this appeal. This year, the story is the same. Although President Obama is boasting of his accomplishments in the White House as the nation's leader, he is also using Congress as a foil to lambaste the way that the ""real"" insiders in the capital do their business. Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum have tried to transform themselves from pillars of the congressional Republican establishment into conservative mavericks, while front-runner Mitt Romney talks frequently about how he would bring the skills of a CEO to Washington. The problem is that doing well in Washington requires a very different kind of skill set than the ones that business executives or mavericks bring to the table. Each of these claims is flawed -- as Obama himself discovered -- given the world in which presidents must operate. Presidents govern in a porous world that makes every move and decision visible to the public within a relatively short time span. Constant scrutiny from the media means the president essentially works inside glass walls. A CEO enjoys a certain amount of space in which to work through the different options on the table, and even some room to make some mistakes in the process, before announcing a final decision. Both Presidents Carter (with ""Lancegate"") and Obama (with the Solyndra scandal) have found out how impossible it is to maintain the image of the maverick once under the constant scrutiny of the media. Moreover, the experiences of the CEO and the outsider do little to prepare a candidate for the government's separation of power. The fact is that the president only gets partial control of the mechanisms to run Washington. In his second year as president, John Kennedy admitted, ""The fact is that I think Congress looks more powerful sitting here than it did when I was in Congress ... when you are in Congress, you are one of a hundred in the Senate or one of 435 in the House, so that power is divided. But from here I look at a Congress and I look at the collective power of the Congress ... and it is a substantial power."" While the CEO does have to report to a board of directors, chief executives don't have to share their own authority with a legislature such as Congress -- two other decision-making authorities that carry great weight, each of which has very different incentives and interests. A recent piece by The New York Times made Romney's gubernatorial experiences sound a lot like Carter's presidency, as the former businessman had immense trouble interacting with members of the state Legislature in Massachusetts. According to one Democratic state senator, ""Romney didn't want to deal with legislators. Typically, the governor wants to have a productive relationship with the legislature. That is not something that happened with him."" Similarly, like it or not, it is hard to act as an outsider once daily life involves dealing with hundreds of insiders with considerable power. A president can talk about reforming government and working outside the system, but will only be able to accomplish things by making deals with the very forces and through the very processes they detest. Once presidents start to do so, they look more like the Washington insiders against which they ran. Finally, presidents have millions of bosses. While the CEO can focus his or her energy on pleasing shareholders or the board of directors and the outsider often does not have to report to anyone at all, the president is being judged by millions of bosses -- the American voters -- each with different interests and objectives. Notwithstanding the constant discussion of a ""red"" and ""blue"" America, the reality is much messier than that. In certain respects, if the nation was divided so clearly along these lines governance would be easier. As presidents start to make tough choices about what legislation to propose and what bills to sign into law, the challenge of having to please so many bosses becomes evident. Indeed, Obama has struggled in recent months to rebuild the coalition that frayed as many of his decisions angered core supporters and alienated the moderate voters he won over in 2008. In the end, presidential politics is about surviving and thriving in Washington. The kinds of talents that so many candidates like to boast about these days really have little to do with the institutions that the winner will have to govern. It's time to recognize that having a deep political resume is more of a virtue than a vice. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Mitt Romney stresses that his career outside Washington is a plus .

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- President Obama's 2012 campaign is gradually starting to take shape. Rather than focusing on the record from his first term and his competence as the commander in chief, the president is promoting himself as a revived populist, anti-establishment Democrat fighting for the unfulfilled goals of his 2008 campaign. Referring to the announcement that Bank of America would charge a debit card fee, the president argued that this justified the need for a consumer bureau. ""You can stop it,"" he said. ""You don't have some inherent right just to, you know, get a certain amount of profit, if your customers are being mistreated."" During a press conference, Obama expressed some support for the protests taking place on Wall Street. The protest ""expresses frustrations American people feel,"" he said. Through statements such as these, the president hopes to recapture some of the energy that fueled his dramatic run for the White House. In some ways, Obama is looking back to President Harry Truman's 1948 campaign against Republican Thomas Dewey. In a stunning come-from-behind campaign, where most of the pollsters were wrong in their predictions, Truman railed against the ""Do-Nothing Congress"" and appealed to core Democratic constituencies such as organized labor to win re-election. But this style of campaign poses many risks to the president in 2012. Obama does not have the same kind of huge foreign policy record that helped Truman neutralize the GOP in 1948, a campaign that came one year after the Truman Doctrine and the same year as the Marshall Plan. Yes, Osama bin Laden was killed and Moammar Gadhafi was ousted during Obama's presidency. But Truman presided over the end of World War II and was the president who oversaw the shaping of America's containment policies to combat international communism. Foreign policy also loomed much larger in the minds of voters as the Cold War was taking shape; today the war on unemployment has overtaken the war on terrorism in the public mind. Rather than repeating the election of 1948, Obama could end up facing some of the problems encountered by President Jimmy Carter in 1980 or, in a different context, Vice President Al Gore in 2000. A populist, anti-Washington campaign is at odds with the Obama whom the nation has seen up close since January 2009. While the president clearly shares many concerns with the left wing of the party, it's also clear that he is much more comfortable staying close to the center. He governs much more like President Bill Clinton than one might have expected from his 2008 primary campaign. Obama is a pragmatist and a politician, less concerned about ideological purity than about political outcomes. The president's relationship with the left has been extremely tense. During a series of legislative battles, including the one over health care reform, Obama kept his distance from the base of his party in an effort to find legislation that could win over the handful of centrists in his own party and the GOP. Some members of his administration, including former press secretary Robert Gibbs, have made tough statements about the need for liberals to be more realistic about their goals. Unlike Truman, who had his own problems with the left, Obama cannot point to a huge record from his party of successful policies that have bolstered the security of America's middle class. When Truman ran in 1948, FDR and the New Deal were still fresh on the minds of most voters. The danger with running too strongly as a populist is that it can quickly appear disingenuous. If Obama pushes too hard on the populist theme, he could sound a bit like Gore in 2000, who fell flat -- after years of standing as a voice of centrism -- when he railed against the wealthy. In certain respects, Obama's efforts to win over the left could backfire, causing activists to feel that they are being used rather than being given an honest choice about whom they would rather have in office -- a Democrat who compromises or a Republican who will be under immense pressure from the tea party. To be sure, the liberal base won't vote for Mitt Romney or Rick Perry. But many could decide not to vote at all. Another problem with Obama's emerging strategy is that the anti-Congress campaign would be hard to pull off. When Truman turned to this theme in 1948, Congress was under Republican control. The nation had divided government, not a divided Congress, which is currently the case with a Democratic-controlled Senate and a Republican House. When Obama lashes out against Congress he is taking shots at his fellow Democrat, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, not just at House Speaker John Boehner. Voters will have trouble seeing how one party is to blame for the performance of Congress when neither party controls everything. Moreover, it is harder to run an anti-establishment campaign when you are the face of Washington. Carter learned this in 1980. The heart of Carter's campaign in 1976 had been to clean up government and regain the trust of voters who were disillusioned with Washington as a result of Watergate. When Carter ran in 1980, he couldn't pull off the anti-Washington stance. Like Obama, Carter was no longer a fresh voice and he was deeply tied to events in Washington. If Obama is too tough on the political establishment, it is possible that some moderate and independent voters might very well agree with his analysis of the problem, but then decide to vote for the Republican nominee who does not carry the same kind of baggage from the capital. The final challenge for Obama is that the focus on anti-government populism will prevent him, or dissuade him, from talking about his legislative accomplishments. In the end, most of the presidents who have successfully run for re-election have defended and championed what they accomplished in Washington. They explained to the voters how they improved the nation. Until now, Republicans have been able to control the narrative of Obama's presidency. They have depicted everything he has done -- from the stimulus to financial regulation -- as ineffective, and they are now developing an argument that he is not only failing to fix the economy but responsible for the worsening of the situation. At some level, Obama needs to explain to voters what he has done and how he has strengthened the nation -- even in difficult economic times. If he simply ignores his own record and allows Republicans to define what happened in his first four years, he risks leaving himself open to a tough attack from his opponents. President Obama must be true to the kind of Democrat he has been -- not trying to reinvent himself in a media culture that constantly reminds voters of who he really is -- and he must define and champion the record that he has accomplished. If the president wants to persuade voters to support him, he has to convince them that his style of politics and his legislative record are the basis for four better years ahead.

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- In the days following the horrendous attacks against the United States on 9/11, all the talk in Washington was about the need for bipartisanship. Republicans and Democrats promised that they would work together to protect the home front and capture those who were responsible. On the day after, Democrats and Republicans followed the traditional post-military crisis ritual of promising to work on policies in bipartisan fashion. New York Sen. Hillary Clinton -- who was still struggling to gain her sea legs in her first year on Capitol Hill, after having spent eight years serving as the first lady during some bruising partisan battles -- announced that it was important to be ""united behind our president and our government, sending a very clear message that this is something that transcends any political consideration or partisanship."" Republicans also promised political peace. House Speaker Dennis Hastert assured the nation that ""we are in complete agreement that we will work together, that we want to share information, that we will be ready to move on whatever the president suggests, and we will go through the debate and the actions of Congress in a bipartisan way to make that happen."" The kind of partisan sniping that voters were accustomed to, he and his colleagues said, would be a thing of the past. The political question on September 12 was how long this unity would last: Would the worst terrorist attack ever on American soil really transform the politics of national security? Ten years later, it is evident that the answer was clearly no. The period of good feelings did not last long. One of the most striking aspects of 9/11 was that even a tragedy of this scale could not tame the partisan forces that shape American politics. Partisanship flared over one of the most important measures that Congress had to deal with in the fall of 2001: airport security. The administration proposed that the federal government take a larger role in guarding airports, but only if Congress granted the president the power to exempt airport security workers from civil-service protections. The GOP insisted that the government needed flexibility when hiring and firing workers so that it could properly handle security concerns. Democrats opposed the president's plan on the grounds that, in their minds, President George W. Bush was trying to use the excuse of national security to weaken unions; Republicans charged that Democrats were holding up the legislation to please organized labor. According to Republican Majority Leader Richard Armey, ""What the Democrats want, is 30,000 new dues-paying contributors."" For its part, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee established a website called ""Unsafe Delay,"" which criticized Republican Whip Tom DeLay for stifling the legislation. Each side blamed the other for the holdup. Congressional Democrats held a rally in front of the Capitol with pilots and flight attendants. This was just was just a taste of what was to come. During the 2002 elections, national security became part of the campaign. In one of the most notorious cases, Republicans launched an attack against Sen. Max Cleland of Georgia, a triple amputee as a result of combat in Vietnam. Cleland, a moderate Democrat whose model had been the centrist Sam Nunn, had sought a compromise on the labor provisions in Bush's homeland security efforts. In one devastating ad, supporters of his Republican challenger, U.S. Rep. Saxby Chambliss, who had received five student deferments and one medical deferment during the Vietnam War, flashed an image of Osama bin Laden before attacking Cleland for his positions on homeland security. Chambliss won the election. ""Really good policy is really good politics,"" explained White House adviser Mark McKinnon, sensing how the Republicans' national security positions could help win the election, ""It's the right thing to do for the right reasons. The domestic agenda right now is security. It's covering up everything else."" While there was some bipartisanship after 9/11, with many Democrats supporting the Patriot Act as well as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the parties blasted each other on the issue of national security at almost every turn. Despite our nostalgia for times when the parties joined forces on foreign policy, politics rarely stops at the water's edge. The moments like 1947 to 1949 when key members of each party work together are exceptions, not the norm. During the famous 80th Congress, which President Harry Truman later made his foil in the 1948 campaign, Michigan Republican Arthur Vandenberg and the president worked closely together to create the modern national security apparatus to fight the Cold War. The National Security Act, which created the CIA and the National Security Council, as well as the Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine, were all products of this bipartisan alliance. Of course, the moment of good feelings disintegrated in the next few years with the bitter battles of the early Cold War. The irony is that partisan battles continue over foreign policy even when there is a basic consensus on policy. This was true during the Cold War, when most politicians were prepared to be tough against communism, and it is the case today when President Barack Obama, despite the campaign of 2008, has continued with most of Bush's war on terrorism. Indeed, recent revelations suggest that the president has barely dismantled any of the counterterrorism programs that were in use. Could the promise of September 12 ever be fulfilled? Certainly today there are enormous areas of consensus between the parties, such as over most counterterrorism policies, over the need for strong homeland security programs and even for strong military vigilance with countries such as North Korea and Pakistan. Nonetheless, the partisan forces that play out on the campaign trail are simply too great to overcome. If 9/11 taught us anything, it's how deeply rooted partisanship is in our modern political culture. Even a tragedy of its magnitude could barely contain the forces that perpetually rip apart members of the two parties. Ten years ago, the parties came together. But they came together just for a brief spell. In the long span of history, it was as if the moment ended before either side could even blink.

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- Something interesting is happening in the Republican Party, and it's not the unexpected rise of Herman Cain and his 9-9-9 plan. The really significant development is the resilience Mitt Romney is showing as a top-tier candidate. Ironically, Romney, the candidate who seems to generate the least excitement among Republican voters -- the candidate by default -- potentially could have the most far-reaching impact on the character of the GOP. Following almost half a century when the heart of the Republican Party moved toward the South and West of the country, a Northeastern Republican remains the likely frontrunner for the nomination. It is unlikely that Cain, who barely has a campaign organization to speak of, will last very long at the top of the polls. Even as Texas Gov. Rick Perry is trying hard to steal his thunder, Romney has been able to stay ahead of most of his opponents. Upon giving Romney his endorsement, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, another part of the new generation of Republicans from the region, said: ""The Northeast Republicans are sticking together in this case."" If Romney wins the nomination, he would place the Northern wing of the party in a position where it has not been since the 1960s. There was a time when Northeasterners, many of whom were relatively liberal, loomed large in the Republican Party. Politicians such as Sens. Jacob Javits, Margaret Chase Smith, Prescott Bush and Charles Mathias, as well as New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, championed a style of conservatism that stressed fiscal and regulatory issues over social and cultural questions. They tended to be more sensitive to issues such as urban revitalization and public transportation that were central to their constituencies. Rather than fighting for all or nothing on government policies they disliked, their goal was to constrain and direct domestic programs. This was a breed of Republican that had to survive in heavily Democratic states, so they understood the art of compromise and learned to work within divided political systems. Standing before hostile Republican delegates who were trying to boo him off the stage at the 1964 convention (when Republicans shifted right by nominating Barry Goldwater), Rockefeller warned that he had ""crisscrossed this nation"" in order to fight to ""keep the Republican party the party of all the people ... and warning of the extremist threat, its danger to the party, and danger to the nation."" Republicans gained strength in the South and West. Democrats took over the coastal states, succeeding in the North, where suburban voters were more liberal on social and cultural issues, and where unions still remained an important force. When Jimmy Carter won the Democratic nomination in 1976 and Bill Clinton in 1992, a big part of their promise was to strengthen Democrats in the South, a region that the party had been losing ever since President Lyndon Johnson finished his term in the late 1960s. Richard Nixon's ""Southern strategy"" was designed for Republicans to capitalize on southern discontent with Democrats following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In the Senate, Northeastern Republicans such as Susan Collins, Lincoln Chafee and Arlen Specter began to seem like anomalies. If Romney wins the nomination, and possibly the presidency, he would likely bring a different sensibility to his party. Romney was born and bred in a region where surviving as a Republican required a different approach than in a place like Georgia. As governor he famously tackled issues such as health care, accepted the need for government to raise revenue, and took a middling course on issues like abortion. Playing to the center is part of a family tradition. In 1968, one of the front-runners for the Republican nomination was Romney's father, Gov. George Romney of Michigan, former CEO of American Motors. Romney, like his son dashing in his appearance, brought many of the same political benefits to the table in an era when Republicans still held a place for the center. As far as Democrats were concerned, he was seen as a dangerous Republican because he could appeal to centrist and independent voters, and even to disaffected Democrats. He was able to win some union support and endorsed the cause of civil rights. George Romney's campaign imploded because of a statement about his trip to Vietnam, where he said he had been brainwashed by the military. The statement created media fodder to question Romney's stability. Right now, many Republicans reluctantly see Mitt Romney as the best possible option for the party. But in certain respects, he might be the most interesting one as well. Without losing the support of the kind of right-wing conservatives who won't go to the Democratic Party, his candidacy offers the GOP the opportunity to tackle issues and policies that have been ignored ever since Rockefeller's generation disappeared from the electoral map. Whether GOP voters have the confidence to take a risk on a candidate who provides a different perspective than Southern and Western Republicans remains to be seen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: If Romney gets GOP nomination, it would signal change for party .

"(CNN) -- Days of sipping umbrella drinks have given way to the stench of backed-up sewage, stuffy cabins without power and limited food. The Carnival Triumph engine fire shows that the best-laid cruise plans can veer terribly off course. Sometimes it's rough waters forcing the ship's captain to change or skip a port of call at the last minute. And then there are the extreme cases of a days-long stranding, or in the case of the Costa Concordia disaster, the loss of 32 lives. When accidents happen, it's not always clear what the cruise line is required to do next. Here are five things we've learned about cruises since the Triumph's engine room caught fire on Sunday: . Emergency systems aren't designed for a pleasant trip . It's unclear at this point what systems are in play aboard the Triumph, but we know that generators are supplying power. And from passengers' grim reports, these emergency measures do not a fun vacation make. ""The emergency generator is sized to provide sufficient power for systems that are necessary for the survivability of the vessel, passengers and crew,"" according to marine engineer Robert Jackson, who is the chair of the engineering technology department at California Maritime Academy. Opinion: Dirty secrets below deck . The plumbing systems on the ship are powered by electricity, and passenger accounts of sloshing sewage indicate that there's not enough to operate facilities for more than 4,000 passengers and crew. ""Since the incident happened on Sunday, technicians have managed to restore limited power on board to operate some toilets and limited functions in certain areas. There is running water, albeit cold water,"" Carnival spokesman Vance Gulliksen said via e-mail. A Coast Guard helicopter delivered an additional generator to the ship on Wednesday to supply more power. How Carnival can clean up the PR mess . Itineraries can change without notice . Cruise lines may change a ship's course mid-voyage. In the case of an engine fire, that's a given, but more routine sailings could also change. Diversions may mean changing a port of call or skipping it altogether, and passengers agree to the unexpected when they purchase tickets. The conditions are included in the cruise line's ticket contract. Carnival ships can ""deviate in any direction or for any purpose from the direct or usual course, and to omit or change any or all port calls, arrival or departure times, with or without notice, for any reason whatsoever,"" including mechanical breakdowns, according to the cruise line's ticket contract. While terms and language vary by cruise line, according to Dan Askin, senior editor at online cruise community Cruise Critic, ""it's pretty standard legalese across the industry that aims to protect the line against every contingency."" This week Triumph sister ships Carnival Legend, Carnival Conquest and Carnival Elation all diverted to provide provisions to Triumph. However, those diversions did not result in any delayed arrivals or skipped ports of call, Gulliksen said. Tears and big hugs as passengers reunite with families . Passenger compensation often is not required . Itinerary changes after a ship departs are considered part of the ""proposed voyage,"" according to Carnival's itinerary change policy. Under the policy, Carnival is not liable for refunds or damages for post-departure changes. But when more than 3,000 passengers are stranded for five days, the cruise line is willing to concede a failed voyage. Triumph passengers will get $500 in addition to a full refund for the cruise and most expenses on board, transportation expenses to get home, as well as a credit for another cruise, Carnival said. Even in much less dire situations, most cruise lines do offer prorated compensation for cruises that are cut short, Askin said. ""After that, there's significant variability in compensation, event by event,"" he said. After a bad cruise, can you cruise into court? Cruise ship inspections vary by ship and country . In addition to the regulations of the International Maritime Organization, a United Nations agency, a ship is subject to the laws of the country whose flag it flies. The ship may also be subject to the laws of a country where it stops. The Carnival Triumph sails under a Bahamian flag, so authorities there are taking the lead in investigating the incident. But because the Triumph stops in U.S. ports and carries U.S. passengers, the U.S. Coast Guard has some inspection oversight over the vessel. The Coast Guard issued a certificate of compliance for the Carnival Triumph on May 17, 2012, after the ship's annual inspection. The Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board have also launched an investigation into the cause of the engine room fire. In contrast, the Costa Concordia, which ran aground and sank off the coast of Italy in January 2012, didn't stop in U.S. ports carrying U.S. passengers, so it wasn't subject to U.S. Coast Guard regulation. Why did the rescue take five days? Passengers may have a legal case . Carnival's ticket contract says the cruise line is not ""liable to the passenger for damages for emotional distress, mental suffering/anguish or psychological injury of any kind under any circumstances, except when such damages were caused by the negligence of Carnival and resulted from the same passenger sustaining actual physical injury, or having been at risk of actual physical injury."" While no physical injuries have been reported, if a passenger contracted a significant disease, such as hepatitis, from unsanitary conditions on the ship, maritime trial attorney John H. (Jack) Hickey believes physical injury could be argued. ""I think that a case can be made that everyone on that ship is at risk of actual physical injury,"" he said. Will passengers file suit and can they win? Yes and yes, Hickey said. Carnival's contract prohibits a class action suit, but Hickey said he's not sure whether it is legally enforceable. Hickey has never filed suit over a cruise ship stranding, but he said these circumstances, particularly the reports of sewage on decks, are exceptional. ""It's a public health disaster in the making."" My celebration trip on the Carnival Triumph: From joy to misery . CNN's Katia Hetter contributed to this report.","Emergency systems aren't designed to support 4,000 people for five days .
A cruise line's ticket contract protects the company from much liability .
Passengers may have a legal case against Carnival, maritime attorney says ."
"(CNN) -- 2012 has been a tumultuous year in American politics. With the presidential election capping off the year, Americans have witnessed a series of bitter domestic battles and turbulent events overseas. As the year closes out, it is worth thinking about some of the most important lessons that politicians and voters can learn from this year as they prepare for 2013. Here are six: . The Republican brand name is in trouble: The GOP took a drubbing in 2012. To be sure, Mitt Romney ran a problematic campaign. His inability to connect with voters and a number of embarrassing gaffes hurt the chances for Republicans to succeed. Just as important to the outcome was the party that Romney represented. Voters are not happy with the GOP. Public approval for the party has been extremely low. Congressional Republicans have helped to bring down the party name with their inability to compromise. Recent polls show that if the nation goes off the fiscal cliff, the Republicans would be blamed. According to a survey by NBC and the Wall Street Journal, 65 percent of people asked for a short word or phrase to describe the GOP came up with something negative. The Republican Party was also the lowest-rated political institution. The exit polls in November showed that the GOP is out of step with the electorate on a number of big issues, including immigration and gay marriage. If Republicans don't undertake some serious reforms and offer fresh voices, all the new messaging in the world won't help them as the competition starts for 2016. Opinion: Madness in the air in Washington . America has grown more liberal on cultural and social issues: The election results confirmed what polls have been showing for some time. If the 1960s was a battle over conservative ""traditional family values"" and liberal ideals of social relations, liberals eventually won. Throughout the year, polls showed, for example, that the public was becoming more tolerant of gay marriage and civil unions. Americans support the view that gay sex should be legal by a margin of 2-1, compared to 1977 when the public was split. In the election, same-sex marriage was approved in three states, voters in Wisconsin sent to office the first openly gay senator, and two states approved of referendums to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. Americans are accepting of social diversity, and expect that the pluralism of the electorate will be reflected by the composition of elected officials in Washington. While there are some conservative voices who lament these changes and warn of a nation that is veering toward Sodom, a majority are more than comfortable that some of the taboos and social restrictions of earlier eras are fading and that we live in a nation which is more tolerant than ever before. These social and cultural changes will certainly raise more questions about restrictive practices and policies that remain in place while creating pressure for new kinds of leaders who are responsive to these changes. The Middle East remains a tinderbox: In the years that followed Barack Obama's election, there was some hope that the Middle East could become a calmer region. When revolutions brought down some of the most notorious dictators in the region, many Americans cheered as the fervor for democracy seemed to be riding high. But events in 2012 threw some cold water on those hopes. The Muslim Brotherhood won control of the Egyptian government. In Syria, the government brutally cracked down on opponents, reaching the point in December where Obama's administration has started to talk about the possibility of the al-Assad regime using chemical weapons, though the severity of the threat is unclear. The battles between Palestinians and Israel raged with rockets being fired into Tel Aviv and Israelis bombing targets in Gaza. Although national attention is focused on domestic policy, it is clear that the Middle East has the capacity to command national attention at any moment and remains as explosive as ever. Our infrastructure needs repair: Hurricane Sandy devastated the Northeast in November, leaving millions of Americans on the East Coast without power and with damaged property. Soon after the hurricane hit, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo made an important point. The infrastructure of our cities is outdated and needs to be revamped so that it can withstand current weather patterns. Speaking of the need for levees in New York, Cuomo said: ""It is something we're going to have to start thinking about ... The construction of this city did not anticipate these kinds of situations."" Regardless of whether Congress takes action on the issue of climate change, in the short term cities and suburbs must do more work to curtail the kind of damage wreaked by these storms and to mitigate the costs of recovery -- building underground power lines, increasing resources for emergency responders, building state-of-the-art water systems, and constructing effective barriers to block water from flooding. The new immigrants are a powerful political and social force: As was the case in the turn of the twentieth century when Eastern and Southern Europeans came into this county, massive waves of immigration are remaking the social fabric of the nation. Latino-Americans, Asian-Americans and other new portions of the electorate who have been coming into the country since the reform of immigration laws in 1965 are coming to represent a bigger and bigger portion of the electorate. Not only are their numbers growing as a voting bloc, but they are more organized and active than ever before, both on election day as well as in policy making. Soon after the election, The New York Times reported that 600 members of United We Dream, a network of younger immigrants who don't have their papers, met for three days to plan how to lobby for a bill that would enable 11 million illegal immigrants to become legal. One of the leaders, Christina Jimenez, explained: ""We have an unprecedented opportunity to engage our parents, our cousins, our abuelitos in this fight."" They have both parties scrambling as Democrats are working to fulfill the promises that brought these voters to their side in November, while some Republicans are desperate to dampen the influence of hardline anti-immigration activists in their party. We need to do something about guns. The year ended with a horrific shooting at an elementary school in Connecticut. When a 20-year-old went on a rampage apparently using guns that had been legally purchased by his mother, the world watched with horror. Several prominent conservative advocates of gun rights, including former congressman and television host Joseph Scarborough as well as Sen. Joe Manchin, made statements indicating that the time has come to impose stricter controls and regulations on the purchase of weapons. ""I don't know anybody in the sporting or hunting arena that goes out with an assault file,"" Manchin said. Over the next few weeks, there will certainly be a big debate about what caused this shooting. People from different perspectives will highlight different issues but making it more difficult for people to get their hands on certain kinds of weapons, while not a cure-all, can only diminish the chances of this happening again. There are many more lessons but these six stand out. After the trauma of the past week, let's hope the new year starts off with better days.

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- Seen from the perspective of 2012, the stunning Broadway revival of ""Death of a Salesman"" offers a powerful reminder that economic policy and family values go hand-in-hand. Although many current politicians like to separate these two issues, the economic foundation of the family is central to its long-term health.In this classic play by Arthur Miller, premiered in 1949 to mesmerized audiences that had lived through the Great Depression, the protagonist is salesman Willy Loman, who is mentally broken down from his constant travel and struggle to make ends meet. ""A small man can be just as exhausted as a great man,"" says Loman's wife, Linda. Loman's son Biff is unable to find a job and fulfill his father's hopes. Biff and his brother, Happy, are worried about their father's mental health, which is rapidly deteriorating. When Willy tries to find a job where he can stay in town to take better care of himself and his family, he ends up losing his job. The story disintegrates from there, culminating with Willy tragically committing suicide with the hope that Biff will use the life insurance money to start his own business. Too often, politicians ignore the kinds of strains that economic problems cause for families. As the historian Matt Lassiter argued in an essay in ""Rightward Bound,"" a book I co-edited, the rhetoric about family values is rooted in conservative politics in the 1970s when political activists on the right and popular culture blamed sexuality and feminism, rather than unemployment and inflation, for problems at home. The rhetoric from the 1970s has stuck. Many conservative Republicans such as former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum still define ""family values"" as having to do with matters of popular culture, abortion or sexuality. When the Republican primaries were still being actively contested, it was common to hear pundits argue that Mitt Romney represented the ""economic conservative"" in the contest and Santorum was the champion of ""family values."" Indeed Republicans often attack Democrats as having little interest in family values while many Democrats shy away from too much talk about the family for fear of looking as if they are trying to appease the right. But as Willy Loman's story makes clear, family values are as much about economics as culture. Today, we're living with economic problems that have a direct correlation on our ability to nurture strong families. The first and most obvious is job growth. The current sluggish recovery has left more than 8% of the work force without jobs, and millions of other Americans feeling that their futures are not secure. When the men and women who run households don't feel that their jobs are stable, or they don't have jobs, tensions quickly mount over basic issues such as paying the rent or mortgage and buying food. According to a Rasmussen poll in 2011, 67% of Americans said that the economy was causing strains on their family. The second economic source of instability comes from taking care of the old. Many Americans are struggling to deal with the generational squeeze of taking care of their younger children while helping their elderly parents as well. These pressures are greatly affected by the health of Social Security and Medicare, two programs that play a vital role for middle-class families. While these policies are often discussed as programs for the ""elderly,"" they have always been conceived as programs to help working families by providing them some relief from the basic costs faced by older members of their families. In coming years, there will be a very big debate over the costs of these programs and the need for reform. It will be essential that policymakers in both parties do what is necessary to protect and strengthen the programs. The third source of economic strain on the family comes from health care. Health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs have been a continually rising burden on family income that few people talk about. If President Barack Obama's health care reform stands, then it will be essential that policymakers figure out how to make it successful. Central will be the need for the states to set up strong and functional health exchange systems and to make sure that the regulatory provisions in the bill are containing costs. If the program is deemed unconstitutional, policymakers in both parties need to go back to the drawing board to figure out how to improve the system. Finally, there is education. Families are been run ragged by the challenges of higher education. The costs continue to rise even as income stagnates. Millions of Americans feel that the costs of higher education make college degrees impossible to earn. In this economy, a college education is vital to economic success. Public policy most keep the interest rates on student loans at a reasonable level to make sure that families are not crushed by the pressures to finance college costs. The federal government must also make sure that states are financially healthy enough to support state colleges and universities. Americans who are in their 20s and 30s struggling to pay off massive college loans are at a major disadvantage when it comes to setting up their own households. This is one area where Obama and Mitt Romney seem to be in agreement, with both parties promising that they won't allow the rates on student loans to increase on July 1. During the 1930s, President Franklin Roosevelt always understood that family security could only result from economic security. This was a central theme of his presidency. As Roosevelt said upon signing Social Security in 1935: ""We have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age."" But over the past few decades, we've lost sight of Roosevelt's words. It's time to rethink the notion of family values and remember, as the story of Willy Loman reminds us, that a strong family starts with a strong economy.

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- America's poverty rate is now the worst since 1993, according to a shocking report last week from the U.S. Census Bureau. Over 46 million people are living in poverty, 2.6 million more than in 2009 and the poverty rate has reached 15.1 percent. The outlook is grim. The recession has compounded decades of growing economic inequality, structural poverty, and urban decay. With the projections that unemployment will remain high for several years, these numbers are not likely to improve. Making matters worse, as Ron Haskings at the Brookings Institution noted, ""Safety net programs run by the federal and state governments are helping millions of families avoid poverty, but thee programs could be subject to cuts at the federal and state level because of continuing deficit and debt problems."" Despite the enormity of this social problem, American politicians in either party rarely discuss the subject. Since the poor don't tend to vote in high rates or contribute much in campaign funds, they don't get a place at the table in Washington, D.C. Yet with the U.S. poverty rate being the highest in the developed world according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, this statistic marks a terrible failure for the nation as a whole. Most Republicans have tended to avoid the question of poverty because they reject the notion that government can do anything to solve it. For decades, conservatives have railed against welfare programs for creating a cycle of dependency. Republicans and conservative Democrats ultimately believe that the only way to reduce poverty is to grow the economy. But poverty has been a problem in good times and bad. Democrats avoid tackling the problem because they fear the political consequences of being tagged as big government liberals. In 1996, when President Clinton signed the welfare reform act that ended Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), he effectively took poverty off his party's agenda. Those who support government programs for the poor have been haunted by the political backlash against the War on Poverty. It was during the 1960s, an era of unprecedented economic growth, that President Lyndon Johnson and allied Democrats decided to tackle the problem of poverty in this wealthy nation. President Kennedy had started to explore an anti-poverty program in 1963 under the guidance of Walter Heller, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, but Kennedy was assassinated before he could take action. When Johnson heard about the program shortly after taking office, he said it was the kind of initiative he could support. Johnson, who had been inspired by the New Deal and grew up amid poverty in Texas, sympathized with the plight of the poor and believed that the government could and should so something about it: ""That's my kind of program. I'll find money for it one way or another. If I have to, I'll take away money from things to get money for people."" To build a legislative coalition in favor of the War on Poverty in 1964, Johnson enlisted the support of liberals in Congress as well as the conservative Democrat Phil Landrum of Georgia, who won over the votes of many in the party who usually opposed new federal programs. Landrum, and other conservatives in the party, had constituencies who struggled with economic hardship. In his address to Congress in March 1964, Johnson said: ""What you are being asked to consider is not a simple or an easy program. But poverty is not a simple or an easy enemy. It cannot be driven from the land by a single attack on a single front. Were this so, we would have conquered poverty long ago. Nor can it be conquered by government alone. For decades American labor and American business, private institutions and private individuals have been engaged in strengthening our economy and offering new opportunity to those in need. We need their help, their support, and their full participation. Through this program we offer new incentives and new opportunities for cooperation, so that all the energy of our nation, not merely the efforts of government, can be brought to bear on our common enemy."" The War on Poverty claimed some notable accomplishments. According to the historian Michael Katz, ""Between 1965 and 1972, the government transfer programs lifted about half the poor over the poverty line."" Many programs, such as Head Start, became popular across the nation and perceived as integral to the well being of struggling Americans. Even as the policies were making great strides, Republicans attacked the War on Poverty as a waste of federal money that only helped elected officials. Many Democratic urban machine politicians lambasted the Community Action Programâ€”a part of the war on poverty that put money into the hands of local organizations to shape anti-poverty initiatives--because they felt the dollars were winding up in the hands of left-wing organizations who then opposed them. Many groups representing the poor felt the War on Poverty did not go far enough. For decades afterward, attempts to reduce levels of poverty through government action were unpopular. Indeed, AFDC, a product of the New Deal commonly known as welfare, became the focus of conservatives who called for eliminating the program and younger Democrats who felt it needed to be reformed. Reforming welfare gained more attention than the problem the program was originally meant to solve. Today's silence about poverty is striking. Very few presidential candidates ever bring up the issue. There have been a few in each party, such as John Edwards for the Democrats and Rick Santorum for the Republicans, but in general this is the cause that has no champion. The new data from the Census Bureau, comes at a crucial time, with government programs on the chopping block as Washington focuses on cutting the budget deficit. Candidates running for office in 2012 should be forced to confront this issue and explain what they intend to do about it. Proposals such as public jobs, education reform, and tax incentives to rebuild blighted areas must be discussed. There must also be strong consideration given to protecting -- and even expanding --state and local services for the poor despite the current obsession with budget cuts. Unless voters and the media help to make this an issue in the campaign, the problem will likely only become worse. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian E. Zelizer.","Census bureau reported sharp rise in Americans in poverty .

"(CNN) -- It's every flier's worst nightmare: Your pilot announces, ""We're all going down!"" and starts shouting about bombs and terrorists. He abandons the cockpit, frantically running up and down the aisles like a man unhinged. What do you do? That's what passengers on a JetBlue flight had to decide Tuesday when their pilot, Capt. Clayton Osbon, seemed to have a meltdown in the air between New York and Las Vegas. Fortunately for everyone on board, a quick-thinking co-pilot and some alert passengers snapped into action. Initial reports suggest that at least four passengers leapt to their feet and subdued the pilot, who had been trying to break down the cockpit door after his co-pilot locked him out. The heroic passengers have been praised for their bravery, and rightly so: They may have saved 141 lives on the plane, and maybe more on the ground. It's hard to hear this story and not admire their swift and effective action -- and wonder how you'd respond in the same situation. Would you jump up and subdue a hysterical pilot or sit paralyzed in your seat? Hundreds of studies have explored the so-called ""bystander effect,"" trying to determine why some observers respond positively to a crisis while others ignore it. The research points to a somewhat surprising conclusion: Generally speaking, only subtle differences separate the bystanders from the heroes. Most of us, it seems, can fall into either category depending on the details of a situation. The JetBlue crisis highlights some of the factors that can make a difference, suggesting how we can get people -- ourselves included -- to take action in an emergency. It might seem obvious that when confronted with a raving man attacking a cockpit door, people would realize they should do something to stop him. But that's not always the case, especially when they're part of a large crowd. In fact, in one famous study, social psychologists John Darley and Bibb Latane left people alone in a room and pumped in smoke -- a pretty clear warning sign of danger, maybe on par with a 250-pound guy in a pilot's uniform shouting incoherently about Iran and Iraq. When people were alone in the room, they left and reported the smoke to someone else 75% of the time. But when there were three people in the room, they reported the smoke 38% of the time, illustrating the problem psychologists call ""pluralistic ignorance,"" where we mistake other people's inaction as a sign that everything's actually OK. After all, no one wants to be the fool who tackles your plane's pilot because you misread the situation -- maybe he was just playing a practical joke? When we don't see anyone else respond, we tend to assume there isn't really a crisis; as a result, we inadvertently hold each other back. But response rates shoot up dramatically when one bystander simply acknowledges to another that there might be a problem. So on the JetBlue flight, it helped tremendously that the co-pilot and a flight attendant had the presence of mind to use the public address system to call on the passengers to restrain the pilot. It becomes nearly impossible to assume there isn't really a problem when your acting captain says there is. Yet even once we recognize there's a problem, in crowds we often fall prey to what's called a ""diffusion of responsibility,"" where we assume the people around us are going to help, so there's less of a need for us to take action ourselves. Research by Darley and others shows that the greater the number of people who witness a crisis, the lower the odds that any of them will do anything. To overcome this, it helps when we're singled out personally. Darley once told me that if you ever sprain your ankle in public, don't just call for help -- pick out someone in the crowd and say, ""Hey, you there, can you give me a hand?"" On the JetBlue flight, it seems like the crew only made a blanket appeal to the passengers for help, which probably wasn't as effective as it could have been. Only four passengers out of nearly 150 sprang to action -- responsibility still might have been pretty diffused. But it likely helped that several of the plane's passengers were retired or off-duty law enforcement on their way to a security convention in Las Vegas. Darley's research has found that personality doesn't necessarily predict whether someone will help. What's more important is whether bystanders have the experience to recognize a crisis when it's unfolding and feel like they have the skills to do something about it. So it probably should come as no surprise that among those who sprang to action, one was a former prison guard and another was an ex-New York police sergeant with 22 years of experience on the force. That sergeant, Paul Babakitis, told CBS News that when he saw the pilot running amok, ""my training immediately kicked in."" He said he believed he was ""deranged"" when he looked into his eyes because he had ""dealt with a lot of emotionally disturbed people during my time on the force."" People who have experience in law enforcement or the military are probably better at recognizing a crisis because they're less likely to convince themselves that this couldn't be happening to them, could it? Of course, ""pluralistic ignorance"" might be harder for any of us to maintain on a plane after 9/11, even 10 years later. It's harder today to rule out the plausibility of any crisis. Indeed, Babakitis said he immediately thought of that day when he saw Osbon storming the cockpit. ""Not again,"" he told himself, ""not while I'm on this plane."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jason Marsh.","Jason Marsh calls quick action of JetBlue passengers with captain admirable .

"(CNN) -- What's an atheist scientist like me doing writing good things about religion? I didn't start out this way. As a teenager, I had contempt for religion. I was raised Jewish, but when I read the Bible, I was shocked. It hardly seemed to me like a good guide for ethical behavior in modern times, what with all the smiting and stoning and genocide, some of it ordered by God. In college, I read other holy books, and they didn't make me any more positive toward religion. In my 20s, I obtained a Ph.D. in social psychology and began to study morality. I ignored religion in my studies. We don't need religion to be ethical, I thought. And yet, in almost every human society, religion has been intimately tied to ethics. Was that just a coincidence? Watch Jonathan Haidt's TED Talk . In my 30s, I began to study the emotion of ""moral elevation."" That's the warm, fuzzy feeling you get when you see acts of moral beauty. When you see someone do something kind, loyal, or heroic, you feel uplifted. You can feel yourself becoming a better person -- at least for a few minutes. Everyone who has watched an episode of Oprah knows the feeling, but there was absolutely no scientific research on this emotion. Studying moral elevation led me to study feelings of awe more generally, and before I knew it, I was trying to understand a whole class of positive emotions in which people feel as though they have somehow escaped from or ""transcended"" their normal, everyday, often petty self. TED.com: Jonathan Haidt on the moral roots of liberals and conservatives . I was beginning to see connections between experiences as varied as falling in love, watching a sunset from a hilltop, singing in a church choir, and reading about a virtuous person. In all cases there's a change to the self -- a kind of opening to our higher, nobler possibilities. As I tried to make sense of the psychology of these ""self-transcendent emotions,"" I began to realize that religions are often quite skilled at producing such feelings. Some use meditation, some use repetitive bowing or circling, some have people sing uplifting songs in unison. Some religions build awe-inspiring buildings; most tell morally elevating stories. Some traditional shamanic rites even use natural drugs. But every known religion has some sort of rite or procedure for taking people out of their ordinary lives and opening them up to something larger than themselves. It was almost as if there was an ""off"" switch for the self, buried deep in our minds, and the world's religions were a thousand different ways of pressing the switch. TED.com: Robert Wright on optimism . In my TED talk, I wanted to illustrate some of these experiences visually. Many scientists who write disparagingly about religion focus on the conscious, explicit beliefs in God and the supernatural. I wanted to shift attention away from that aspect of religion onto the more emotional and social aspects. Whether or not you believe in God, religions accomplish something miraculous: They turn large numbers of people who are not kin into a group that is able to work together, trust each other, and help each other. They are living embodiments of e pluribus unum (From many, one). No other species on the planet has ever accomplished that. Bees and ants are great at it, but they can only do it because they are all sisters. And this brings us to the most contentious question in the scientific study of religion: Is religiosity -- including our tendency to believe in supernatural entities as well as our ability to lose ourselves in religious rites -- an adaptation? Did we evolve to be religious? TED.com: Billy Collins on everyday moments . Some biologists, such as Richard Dawkins (author of ""The God Delusion""), argue that we did not. They say that religions are cultural inventions which are costly and destructive for individual believers. They say that religions only persist and spread because they get into our minds the way that a virus gets into our bodies. Once someone believes that he'll be rewarded for recruiting converts and punished forever in hell for leaving the church, he tends to do things that help the church, even if they hurt him. But I find another perspective much more compelling: Our minds evolved to be religious in tandem with our cultures. Cultures evolve in ways that are somewhat analogous to organisms: as long as groups are competing with each other, then features that foster survival and growth tend to spread; features that are self-destructive become less frequent. What atheists can learn from religion . Cultural groups that found effective ways to bind non-kin together out-competed groups that were less cohesive. This is a view put forward originally by Charles Darwin, but revived in modern times by the biologists David Sloan Wilson, at Bimghamton University, and Edward O. Wilson, at Harvard. This is a view called ""group selection,"" because it argues that our genes came down to us today not just because some individuals were more fit than their neighbors, but because some groups were more fit (more cohesive and cooperative) than their neighboring groups. I've spent my whole career trying to figure out what morality is and how human beings came to be moral creatures. Religion, I believe, is an essential piece of the puzzle. I'm still an atheist, but nowadays I'm one who finds a lot to admire in religion and in religious communities. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jonathan Haidt.","Jonathan Haidt: Religion, like love and ethical action, offers a way to transcend the self .
He says whether you believe or not, religion accomplishes the miracle of group inspiration .
Haidt says religion's ability to move people makes it an evolutionary advantage for groups .
He says our minds evolved to be more religious in tandem with our cultures ."
"(CNN) -- This week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released its newest study on the rate of autism among 8-year-olds, showing that 1 in 88 has some form of the disorder. Previously, it was 1 in 110. Does the new figure indicate that we are seeing an epidemic of autism, as some have speculated? At this point, it's not clear. One possibility is that we are seeing the result of better detection rather than a real surge in autism. However, there are some striking parts about the study, which used data from 2008 collected in 14 sites across the United States. The rate of autism increased by more than 45% from 2002 to 2008 in numerous sites. It was a larger and more consistent increase than from 2002 to 2006. Also intriguing is that the increase was very uneven in terms of geography, gender, race and ethnicity. Some sites had nearly five times as many children with autism as others. In several sites, almost 1 in 33 8-year-old boys were diagnosed with autism. This seems difficult to believe, particularly when these sites had smaller samples and children with less severe intellectual disabilities. One wonders if some sites became part of the study because of a long-term commitment to autism services, and this had drawn certain families to live nearby, resulting in an increase in the frequency of diagnoses made by local medical centers or educational programs. But since the children didn't just meet the CDC study criteria for autistic characteristics -- 80% of them had autistic diagnosis from community physicians -- it may be that there is truly a higher rate of autism. Granted, the children were not actually seen by CDC researchers, so it's possible that the methods of diagnosis varied among the sites. So, what are the implications of the study? The CDC researchers are aware that it's critical to identify the sources of variability in their data. For example, why were nearly twice as many children diagnosed with autism in Utah than in Colorado or Arizona? If the rates are really increasing, does it mean that many more children, particularly those from ethnic or racial minorities who are often missed, could have autism and we just don't know yet? If we do a better job of identifying children with autism, the rate will certainly continue to increase. How do we address this issue, which is not unique to autism? Thomas Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health, commented that the most useful approach right now is to assume that there is an increase in autism and try to figure out why this is happening. Since we know the disorder is a neurobiological condition, could it be caused by environmental factors? Many researchers are trying to find out. Regardless of all the unanswered questions, we should keep in mind that autism is a common condition. More children need autism services than ever before. We need cost-effective ways to identify the disorder at early ages, provide adequate support and work with affected families to help their children transition to adulthood. For families concerned that their child might have autism, it's important to be persistent in seeking help. The study suggests that children with autism in some parts of the country are much more likely to be recognized than in other parts, so seek the best resources possible and do not give up until you are sure. It may be that your child does not have autism since the disorder overlaps with various other common conditions such as delayed language ability and attention deficit disorder. Far more children don't have autism than do. With world autism awareness day coming up on Monday, there are many reasons to hope for a brighter future for children and adults who have autism. Despite the concerns about rising autism rates, more services and treatments are available, and they will get even better. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Catherine Lord.","A new government study shows that rate of autism has increased .

"(CNN) -- Once again, Syria is at a crossroads. Former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan deserves applause for brokering a ceasefire in a conflict where others have failed, and where some have been only too ready to press military buttons. Despite the seeming success of diplomacy, the conflict in Syria is far from over. This is only a new beginning. Make no mistake: Annan's mission was not accepted by the regime in Damascus because they were instinctively in line with his thinking. Annan was embraced by the Chinese, Russians, and Syrians because he had come conveniently after the brutal killings in Hama and Homs. It was more timing than principle. If Annan had come while parts of Homs and Hama were under rebel control, then President Bashar al-Assad and his backers would have rejected the U.N. mission. Now that al-Assad has regained territory from the opposition, he is keen to be seen as a peacemaker. Annan's proposals are ambitious, morally right, and urgently needed. From the need for a political process where opposition elements and the regime are in direct talks, to troop withdrawals, to providing humanitarian assistance, to releasing those arbitrarily detained and allowing free media access to respecting the freedom to protest peacefully. But al-Assad violated all of these principles previously, so why would he behave any differently now? His calculation must be altered to realize that the fear that he and his father, Hafez al-Assad, had instilled in the hearts of many Syrians is now gone. Suppressing popular protests with tanks cannot be repeated constantly with impunity, particularly after the U.S. presidential elections. The political will of the occupant of the White House next January could be stronger on intervening in Syria. It is a question of time before the conflict in Syria flares up again. Annan and the countries involved will only contain, mitigate and offset the parties for a limited time while the opposition regroups. Too much blood has been spilled, too many wounds are open to pretend that violence will not resume again. (Indeed, there were reports after the agreement was reached that violence had resumed in several areas of the country, where government troops were accused of shelling and burning homes, killing dozens.) While Annan's mission hopes to bring all sides to the table, the Syrian government and opposition cannot risk the continuing escalation of violence. The answers to the conflict in Syria do not come from outside intervention, but from inside Syria's opposition movement. Those within the opposition who have opted for violence must immediately return to nonviolence. The lesson of this last year is that the al-Assad regime will meet opposition violence with a disproportionate response and fight to the death. With no coherent leadership, with deep disunity and no real vision for a new Syria, the opposition is fighting for an empty cause. It is more productive in the long term, therefore, that it uses the hiatus provided by Annan to peacefully mobilize the masses inside Damascus and Aleppo, publish a manifesto that gains purchase from minority Syrians that sectarian violence will not rise in a post-Assad Syria, and bring on board the major religious, tribal and business figures inside country. Such measures will help build confidence among noninterventionists in the West, and will result in defections from the military and diplomatic top brass in al-Assad's government. Failure to do the hard work at the grass-roots level inside Syria while demanding Western military support would be both naÃ¯ve and dangerous. Conversely, the regime knows its days are numbered. It cannot butcher dissidents in Hama and Homs and expect to rule the country without introducing serious, substantial reforms. The constitutional referendum last month was held in haste to address the demand for this very thing. Not only does al-Assad need to win over the opposition's more pragmatic actors, but it must demonstrate adherence to Annan's plan. But knowing the conniving and deceptive nature of this regime, I do not believe it will sincerely adhere to the letter and spirit of the Annan proposals. Annan may well prove to be al-Assad's last gamble. If he flunks this opportunity to allow for the six-point plan to demonstrably materialize, then it will be nigh impossible to stop Western firepower from pounding his presidential palace, apartments in Mezzeh, military barracks and bases in the Alawite mountains in Lattakia, Tartous and elsewhere. For his own sake, for the sake of his family and countrymen, al-Assad must deliver. Annan is his last warning, and last chance. He would be well advised to accept the invitations from Doha and Tunis to go into exile, save himself and his family from further danger, and rescue Syria from the increased risk of all-out civil war. The onus is on al-Assad, as much as it is on the opposition to illustrate that it can unite and offer a credible alternative to him. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Husain.","Ed Husain says Kofi Annan's deal with Syria's government is a new chance for regime .

"(CNN) -- Research In Motion has a battle on its hands if it is to win back the hearts and minds of the smartphone-buying public. Earnings are down, sales are down, and now the company is battling rumors that it is pulling out of the consumer market altogether. The company's biggest challenge in the coming months is to prove to business and consumers alike, that they have the ability to match the Android, Apple, and even the Microsoft juggernauts that are heading off into the distance with their customers. Thirteen years ago, when I spotted my first BlackBerry in Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, the American businessman holding the device drew a crowd. At the time we were all amazed and impressed by his ability to check and send emails on the go from a device that fitted in his pocket. But RIM's biggest problem is that its key selling point -- email -- is no longer a key differentiator in the battle for the best handset. Email is a given, and while secure email appeals to some, it is not a requirement of the majority. That has left RIM with a problem that is forcing them to refocus and button down what they offer. Read more: BlackBerry set to offer free apps for outage . The company cannot forget its business roots and high-flying business travelers in airports around the world, and for many businesses RIM is still the best choice. The CTO that chooses your company phone doesn't care whether you'll want to play Angry Birds on it -- he cares that the emails you send are secure and the phone lasts long enough so your team members can reach you if you've left the office. At the other end of RIM's marketplace is the consumer youth market. Parents are happy to go BlackBerry because they are cheap to run, offer BBM to their kids for talking to their other friends, and don't cost a fortune to buy. And therein lies the problem. The latest earnings seem to demonstrate that people no longer tend to buy BlackBerries, they have them bought for them by work and by their parents. The challenge is for RIM to show that it is still relevant, that it hasn't given up the fight, and that it does still have the ammunition to fight back. Patrick Spence, the company's managing director of global sales and marketing, has said that the rumors of RIM pulling out of the consumer market are wholly inaccurate and that the company is merely refocusing efforts on its core strengths. For RIM that means its enterprise customer base is now once again a key focus. It's got to make sure the bits of the company that work, work smoothly, and bring in the supplies to support the rest of the business for the fight ahead.

"(CNN) -- $640 million dollars. We all know that number. It's the amount of last week's record Mega Millions jackpot. The media coverage reached a fever pitch as the prize rose to an awe-inspiring amount of money. I haven't bought a lottery ticket in more than ten years but even I was sucked in hoping that I could win, despite knowing that I had a better chance of dating Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Aniston -- at the same time. But I felt luck was on my side since I had recently received e-mails informing me that I had won the national lottery of Nigeria despite my never having ever purchased a ticket. In any event, for a few days, the lottery joined us all in a collective moment of dreaming ""what if..."" If you simply chose six numbers correctly, your next stop would be a mansion and being able to finally tell your boss what you truly thought of him or her. The media bombarded us with stories examining the lottery from every angle: The odds, the ways to increase your chances, how people would spend their new fortune if they won, etc. Issues like the presidential election, the economy and the Rush Limbaugh controversy faded to the back burner. In a way, the lottery had morphed into our own version of ""The Hunger Games."" It became our national obsession. For those who haven't read ""The Hunger Games,"" it's a popular book series which is now the No. 1 film in America. In the story, the nation is obsessed with the ""Hunger Games"" -- an annual event in which contestants are chosen to battle each other in the ultimate reality TV show. The rules of the game are simple: The winner is the one person who stays alive. Our lottery, along with the ""Hunger Games, "" share similarities with another game of chance: The gladiator games of ancient Rome. Despite the stakes being obviously different in each of these three types of games, all are state-sponsored forms of entertainment. And all three not only amused the citizenry, but lead the public to ignore -- however briefly -- the more pressing issues of the day. But our lottery is far more dangerous than either the ""Hunger Games"" or the gladiator matches. The lottery is not just a distraction -- it's an opiate for our masses. The lottery can numb people into believing that since you have a chance to become a millionaire by simply spending a dollar on a ticket, then you can achieve the American dream without putting in the real work. This mentality can dissuade people from battling the true barriers to economic mobility that threatens our society, such as the inability of many to afford a college education due to soaring costs, the gender wage gap that allow men to earn more than women for the same job, and the income stagnation that has plagued the middle class. Despite the astronomical odds of winning the lottery, it is sold to us by the states as a realistic way of attaining dreams of a better life. Indeed, the states play on these very aspirations with their lottery slogans, like Minnesota's ""What kind of mega millionaire would you be?,"" North Dakota's ""If you don't buy a ticket, how is lady luck going to find you?,"" or Washington's ""Whose world could you change?"" Michigan at one time even used a class-conscious slogan in its lottery commercials: ""The Rich. Join them."" This tag line took into account the reality that the ones buying lottery tickets are not ""the rich."" You're never going to see Donald Trump, Warren Buffet or even Mitt Romney in line at a deli to buy lottery tickets. In fact, at least 20% of Americans play the lottery on a regular basis. Those who have lower incomes buy a higher percentage of tickets. And when unemployment goes up, lottery sales generally increase as people hang their hopes on this game of chance. The 43 states that sell lottery tickets happily take money from their residents knowing full well the income levels of those who are buying the tickets and the grotesquely miniscule odds of winning. I'm not saying that we should ban the lottery, but states should not just tout the pipe dream of winning the jackpot. They should also encourage their citizens to use their hard-earned money in a way that can make them into true ""winners"" -- by saving for an education or investing their salaries in things that can actually provide a return. The lottery is more dangerous than the fictional ""Hunger Games"" or historical gladiator games. In those events, only a handful of people suffered. In contrast, the lottery hurts millions of Americans.

"(CNN) -- As the scale of the humanitarian crisis in Syria mounts, so have the calls for military intervention. Bashar al-Assad's regime has been brutal, calculating and impervious to world opinion; with the assistance of Russia and China, it has dodged a U.N. mandate to halt the attacks on its own people. The now-familiar pattern of the Arab Spring -- popular outcries for freedom provoking hideous repression, which we saw in Libya in 2011 -- seems to warrant military intervention to stop the slaughter in Syria. But first we need answers to some hard questions. Please. We have just exited Iraq after 8Â½ years, a cost of more than $1 trillion and a loss of some 5,000 U.S. service members. And Iraq is still a cockpit for sectarian struggle and violence. In Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, strong Islamic sentiments have inevitably surfaced despite the democratic and Western-oriented facade of the initial Arab Spring uprisings. The future orientation of these states is likely to be less helpful to U.S. aims and policies in the region than their predecessors. And overshadowing Syria is the worry of Iran's nuclear ambition, and the fact that ""all"" options must be kept available in case diplomacy fails there. So, in the case of Syria, we must ask, first, what are the U.S. national interests at stake? What is our objective? Then, how would the use of force attain that objective? How much force, how applied, at what cost? What is the end state we seek? What basis in international law is there for action? Which allies will help us? And, when all is said and done, have we actually achieved what we set out to do, and at a cost and risk proportionate to U.S. interests? In addition to humanitarian concerns, there are significant U.S. strategic interests at play in Syria. The Syrian regime is a ""front-line"" state to America's ally Israel, and so is critical to lasting peace there. And while the Syrian regime has flirted with a peace agreement, it has also served as a conduit of Iranian influence and threats. McCain calls for airstrikes on Syria . Syria hosts Iranian advisers and assists Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed fighting force that has squeezed and threatened Israel from the north, provoked one border war already, taken a powerful and coercive role inside neighboring Lebanon, and which serves as a major factor of regional intimidation as Iran angles to attain its nuclear aims. Moreover, the Syrian regime is a Cold War relic, maintaining a strong military and inviting ties with America's geostrategic competitor, Russia. Unlike the case of Libya, the United States has substantial strategic interests in Syria but would be facing a strong, capable military still mostly loyal to al-Assad. Syria is less accessible militarily than Libya, with a population triple its size -- 22 million, including some 2 million Christians. Opinion: World shouldn't stay silent in face of regime's brutality . Weapons are flowing in, refugees are fleeing, but there seems to be little in the way of an organized Syrian opposition with which to work. And while Saudi Arabia and Qatar are calling for al-Assad's removal, this seems more of an opportunistic anti-Iran strategy. Among the resistance forces are apparently some radical Sunni fighters, perhaps al Qaeda itself, and others whose ascension to power would likely cause a further crisis, with millions of Christians and other religious minorities fleeing from the region. While the U.S. aim in ending the violence and saving lives is obvious, this is a much more complicated and demanding scenario than Libya. There is as yet no international mandate, not even from NATO. The most appropriate form of intervention is reportedly under study -- but it looks like almost any course of action will increase the violence, not reduce it. And who will be available in the skies and on the ground to help? How will a new government be formed, and how will Syria be managed until then? What is needed right now is clear thinking, solid planning and a well-supported international strategy for the region, including Iran -- before we act.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Justice Department is scrambling to meet a federal court's Thursday deadline to answer fundamental constitutional questions dealing with the health care law championed by President Barack Obama, an escalating political battle that has embroiled all three branches of government. Administration officials said Wednesday they were deciding how to respond to an order from a three-judge appeals panel hearing a separate challenge to the Affordable Care Act. Department lawyers were told to explain whether federal courts could intervene and strike down congressional laws as unconstitutional. Such a power has been guaranteed since the Supreme Court's landmark 1803 ruling in Marbury v. Madison. This came after a federal judge appeared to be deeply concerned by the president's comments this week, in which he challenged the high court not to take what he called an ""unprecedented"" step of overturning the law. The White House tried to defuse the ideological firestorm, saying President Obama's words were misunderstood. The three judges are Republican appointees from the 5th Circuit U-S Court of Appeals, meeting in Houston. They were hearing a challenge to the health care law from physician-owned hospitals, despite the fact the Supreme Court is deciding the constitutional questions. The high court's rulings expected in June would take precedence over any other courts hearing similar appeals. The latest dispute surfaced Monday when the president said, ""I'm confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress and I just remind conservative commentators that for years, what we've heard is, the biggest problem on the bench was judicial activism or a lack of judicial restraint, that an unelected group of people would somehow overturn a duly constituted and passed law."" Some conservative commentators accused the president of trying to ""bully"" the federal courts into backing the law, or risk attacks on their credibility. A day after the president's remarks, the federal appeals court held its open hearing. Judge Jerry Smith, a Reagan appointee, was especially tough on a Justice Department lawyer defending the law, specifically mentioning the Obama quotes. ""I'm referring to statements by the president in the past few days to the effect, and I'm sure you've heard about them, that it is somehow inappropriate for what he termed 'unelected' judges to strike acts of Congress that have enjoyed -- he was referring to, of course, Obamacare -- to what he termed broad consensus in majorities in both houses of Congress,"" said Smith. ""That has troubled a number of people who have read it as somehow a challenge to the federal courts or to their authority or to the appropriateness of the concept of judicial review,"" he continued. ""And that's not a small matter. So I want to be sure that you're telling us that the attorney general and the Department of Justice do recognize the authority of the federal courts through unelected judges to strike acts of Congress or portions thereof in appropriate cases. Government lawyer Dana Lydia Kaersvang appeared initially taken aback, but replied such authority has existed for centuries. Nevertheless, Smith and Judges Emilio Garza and Leslie Southwick then ordered the Justice Department to submit by noon Thursday a three-page, single-spaced letter addressing whether the Obama administration believes courts do indeed enjoy that power. Smith's phrasing in open court of the law as ""Obamacare"" mirrors a term used by many opponents of the law. The specific issue before the appeals court was a provision in the law restricting doctor-owned hospitals from expanding their facilities. The challenge was brought by an East Texas spine-and-joint hospital in East Texas. Just hours after the appeals court hearing, Obama on Tuesday clarified his earlier statements, saying, ""The point I was making is that the Supreme Court is the final say on our Constitution and our laws, and all of us have to respect it, but it's precisely because of that extraordinary power that the court has traditionally exercised significant restraint and deference to our duly elected legislature, our Congress. And so the burden is on those who would overturn a law like this."" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, facing a flurry of reporter questions, said the president was articulating the view the high court has for 80 years generally deferred to congressional authority, specifically on economic legislation based on the Constitution's Commerce Clause, and was not challenging the Supreme Court. ""It's the reverse of intimidation, he's simply making an observation about the fact that he expects the court to adhere to that precedent,"" he said. ""It's obviously, as he made clear yesterday, up to the court to make its determination, and we will wait and see that the court does."" Attorney General Eric Holder defended the president. ""I think that you know what the president said a couple of days ago was appropriate,"" said Holder, speaking at a health care fraud prevention event in Chicago. ""I don't think he broke any new ground in the comments that he made."" There was criticism aimed at both Obama and the federal courts over the divisive political issue. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell accused the administration of trying to ""browbeat"" and ""intimidate"" the justices. ""The president, more than anyone else, has an obligation to uphold the legitimacy of our judicial system,"" said the Kentucky Republican. ""But his remarks on the [Supreme] Court reflect not only an attempt to influence the outcome, but a preview of Democrat attacks to come if they don't get their way."" Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network, said President Obama was out of bounds. ""The president is tying to bully the court here, threatening them that if they don't come down his way, they're going to have the same thing that happened in the State of the Union address 2010. He's going to be calling them activists, he's going to be saying they're political."" The president two years ago attacked the conservative majority for striking down a campaign finance reform law, giving corporations greater power to spend in federal elections. But some conservative legal sources privately expressed disappointment in the appeals court's order, saying it appeared punitive and petty to demand the Justice Department defend a position it had never disputed in court. ""It was like he [the judge] was giving a homework assignment to an unprepared student,"" said one right-leaning lawyer, who opposed the law. ""It has the effect of putting the judiciary on the defensive, and could give rise to concerns the courts will look at the law from a political, not constitutional perspective."" The high court held three days of oral arguments last week, dealing with four major questions surrounding the health care law. The justices have not, and by custom will not, comment on pending appeals. Their written opinions due in the next three months will be the final word on the Affordable Care Act's constitutionality, particularly the ""individual mandate"" provision that requires most Americans to have health insurance by 2014, or face a financial penalty. The outcome of the cases have raised the stakes in a presidential year, and could have a lasting effect on the credibility of the federal courts, which are supposed to be beyond policies. ""I think what we are seeing here is the courts, and the confrontation between the administration and the courts, being drawn in to overall polarization that defines so much of modern political life. Every aspect of this has been extraordinary,"" said Ron Brownstein, a CNN political analyst. ""Obama's comments Monday were more pointed and sharp than a president usually directs toward the Supreme Court; the response by a Reagan-appointed judge, more pointed and sharp than you might have expected from a lifetime-tenured member of the judiciary. And you really see here how even the idea of the court as something of an island apart from the intensity of political conflict is really breaking down."" CNN's Brian Todd and Dugald McConnell contributed to this report.","A three-judge appeals panel is hearing a challenge to the Affordable Care Act .

"(CNN) -- Like everyone else who listened to the arguments at the Supreme Court last week, I have no crystal ball for predicting whether the justices will uphold or strike down the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. But it seemed clear to me, as it did to most observers, that the court's five Republican appointees are leaning toward invalidating the act's minimum coverage provision, the ""mandate"" provision that requires most Americans to acquire health insurance by January 2014. This was somewhat surprising. Even more surprising, though, was that several of the justices also seemed inclined to strike down the entire law, all 2,700 pages of it. This would be extraordinary. It would mark the first time in almost 80 years that the court invalidated such a significant federal law as exceeding Congress' enumerated powers. It would also be the first time since the 1930s that it used the unconstitutionality of a law's single provision to strike down a hugely important law in its entirety. The justices' apparent willingness to take such steps suggests they may not appreciate the political stakes. A decision to wash away the most important federal statute in a generation, rendered in the heat of a presidential campaign, would likely unleash a political firestorm -- one that could significantly threaten the stature of the Supreme Court. Opinion: After the mandate, a boom in government-run health care . Some justices seem to ignore public opinion. Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia have proclaimed as much. And it would certainly be troubling if the court were take ordinary politics into account in resolving most questions coming before it. But this is no ordinary case, and the court cannot afford to blithely ignore how the nation's reaction might harm its long-term institutional standing. As Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist, the judiciary possesses ""neither force nor will, but merely judgment."" And the court's ability to serve its assigned role in our constitutional system as a critical check on the political process depends on the justices' capacity to show the nation that it is exercising principled, reasoned judgment. Opinion: Obama should know better on Supreme Court's role . In short, the justices must maintain the nation's faith that their decisions are grounded in legal principle rather than partisan politics. For if Americans see the court as no more than another partisan body, the justices' capacity to persuade persons of diverse ideological hues will be lost. So will, in important respects, our conception of the rule of law. With respect to the health care law, an ideologically predictable 5-4 decision -- especially to invalidate the law in its entirety -- runs the risk of creating precisely such an impression. It would be misguided, but that is beside the point. The impression alone poses serious dangers. Opinion: Obama was too timid on health care . Moreover, the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is only one of several high-profile, highly ideological disputes heading the court's way. In the next few years, the justices will also be confronting Arizona's controversial immigration law (S.B. 1070); the University of Texas's race-based undergraduate admissions program; a sequel to Citizens United v. FEC, which allowed unlimited union and corporation spending in elections; and, most likely, the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act, the Defense of Marriage Act (which defines marriage as a union of one man and one woman) and California's Proposition 8 (which bans same-sex marriage in that state). A steady stream of 5-4 decisions along predictable ideological lines, led by a decision to invalidate the 2010 health law, could prove toxic. This is not just sour grapes from those who substantively disagree with an increasingly conservative court. Chief Justice Roberts has eloquently voiced the same concern. In his numerous paeans to Chief Justice John Marshall, Roberts has recognized that the court must attend to its institutional stature with great care. If the justices are careless with the court's political capital, Roberts has warned, the court will ""lose its credibility and legitimacy as an institution. ""The justices must not just be principled and nonpartisan; they must also appear that way to the nation."" Ultimately, the public's faith in the justices as neutral arbiters of law is essential to the court's legitimacy, the independence of the federal judiciary and even the rule of law. When that faith is diminished, something incredibly precious is lost -- something far more important than the outcome of any one case. I fear that the justices are playing with fire. For the sake of the court, I sure hope they are careful.

"(CNN) -- The captain is still in charge. No matter how technologically advanced a cruise ship may be or how modern its safety procedures or how strict the web of international regulations, passenger safety still depends on the captain's ability to make good decisions. It's not clear what difference more stringent regulations would have played in the decisions of Captain Francesco Schettino, who allegedly deviated from a set route, abandoned ship after the disaster with passengers still aboard and did not return to the ship to lead rescue efforts when ordered by local port officials, according to transcripts between authorities and the captain. In light of the Concordia disaster, the new head of the International Maritime Organization -- the United Nations agency responsible for shipping safety, security and prevention of marine pollution -- has promised to look into the regulation of large passenger ships. ""We should seriously consider the lessons to be learnt and, if necessary, re-examine the regulations on the safety of large passenger ships in the light of the findings of the casualty investigation,"" IMO Secretary-General Koji Sekimizu said in a statement released Monday. ""In the centenary year of the Titanic, we have once again been reminded of the risks involved in maritime activities."" Passengers first, then crew, then captain . In addition to the United Nations agency, a ship is subject to the laws of the country whose flag it flies, often called ""flag administration."" The ship may also be subject to the laws of a country where it stops. (The Concordia didn't stop in U.S. ports carrying U.S. passengers, which means it wasn't subject to U.S. Coast Guard regulations, according to Brad Schoenwald, senior marine inspector of the U.S. Coast Guard's Cruise Ship National Center of Expertise.) In the Concordia case, the laws of Italy also apply. Schettino may face charges including manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning a ship when passengers were still on board, chief prosecutor Francesco Verusio said. Abandoning ship is a maritime crime that has been on the books for centuries in Spain, Greece and Italy, according to Alessandra Batassa, a lawyer in Rome, although many other countries have long abandoned it. Although U.S. law doesn't single out abandoning ship as a crime, it's a longtime maritime tradition that the captain be the last one off a sinking ship, according to maritime law professor Craig Allen, visiting professor of law at Yale University Law School and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. ""If you're going to be master of a ship, your responsibility is first to your passengers, second to your crew, then you look after yourself,"" said Allen, a Coast Guard veteran. ""It's shameless and dishonorable [for the captain] to take himself out of the mix like that."" Current international regulation . Under current international regulations, each cruise company must have a safety plan, called a safety management system, that details responsibilities in the event of an emergency, Schoenwald said. In the event of a fire on board, the captain would sound the general emergency alarm -- seven short blasts followed by one longer blast -- to direct crew members to fight the fire and direct passengers to their specified ""muster"" stations, where passengers are directed during safety drills to gather in event of emergency. If the incident is contained, passengers might be allowed to resume their normal activities or be kept away from the damaged part of the ship until a return to port, or they might be required to abandon ship. ""The call to abandon is made by the captain,"" Schoenwald said. ""When the abandon ship signal is made, they have 30 minutes to get everyone off the ship, even though the general emergency could have started a day or hour before."" It's not clear to Miami maritime attorney Brett Rivkind why the captain didn't issue a mayday signal to call for outside help soon after the accident. ""[A captain needs] to know your ship and what danger your ship is in,"" he said. ""Tilting and listing is a pretty good sign"" of distress. Passengers can be prepared . While passengers have little or no control over the abilities of their captain or crew, disasters like the Concordia are rare. Still, passengers can take steps to ensure a safe trip much of the time. AAA Travel recommends that U.S. citizens who are traveling internationally register with the U.S. Department of State's free Smart Traveler Enrollment program (STEP) at https://travelregistration.state.gov or directly at U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates, AAA spokeswoman Cynthia Brough said. This will help the State Department better help them during an emergency. Before you board, make a copy of your passport and have a bag with necessities like hard-to-replace medication, said Kimberly Wilson Wetty, head of the Valerie Wilson Travel's cruise department. As soon as you board your ship and arrive at your room, find your life vest and participate in the mandatory safety drill, called a muster drill. ""If you've been on a number of cruises, you don't pay as close attention [to the muster drill] as you probably should,"" said John Deiner, managing editor of CruiseCritic.com. Though attendance is mandatory, he said, there are often a few people who skip the drill. Find out where you'll get a life jacket if an emergency keeps you from returning to your room for yours. During the cruise, place your purse and necessities in the same place in your room every time you enter. Whatever went wrong to cause or exacerbate the Concordia cruise ship disaster, most of the Concordia crew and passengers safely made it off the ship. And though the images of the disaster may turn off many people to cruising, experts say it's still one of the safest transportation methods available. CNN's Marnie Hunter, Barbie Latza Nadeau and Hada Messia contributed to this report.","New cruise ship regulations are possible .

"(CNN) -- I thought she was over. Madonna, that is. I thought she was too old to be referring to herself as a ""girl."" I thought pop music passed her by. I thought Lady Gaga had killed her. And then I look at this week's Billboard chart and I see I thought wrong. Her 12th CD, ""MDNA"" debuted No. 1 on the album chart and she has two singles on the dance-chart Top 10. She's 53 and the clubs are banging her new stuff, including ""Give Me All Your Luvin,"" which became her 38th top 10 hit on the pop chart. For those of you keeping score, that's more than Elvis, more than The Beatles. I'm not saying she's better, but clearly she's done -- correction -- doing more. This year she won another Golden Globe and her halftime performance at the Super Bowl drew more viewers than the game itself, according to Nielsen. I know the perception is that only gay men care about Madonna, but if that were true, given the 114 million viewers who tuned in to watch her at halftime, maybe ""don't ask, don't tell"" should have been called ""just assume."" The reality is it's hard for pop music to leave behind someone who keeps leading the pack. Madonna had the highest grossing tour ever for a solo artist (2008) and has sold more than 300 million records worldwide. She's an '80s child whose 2005 single ""Hung Up"" holds the Guinness Book record for topping the charts in 41 countries, while 2012's MDNA was No. 1 on iTunes in 40 countries. That's not ""over,"" that's now. When you look at where Madonna's career is today in the same week we learned Whitney Houston drowned in a foot of water, you're reminded that God truly does work in mysterious ways. The two pop icons released debut albums within two years of each other, Madonna in 1983 and Houston in 1985. Of course, Houston was the former model with a voice for the ages, while Madonna was the thin-voiced tart rolling around on the floor of the MTV music awards in a wedding dress proclaiming that she felt like a virgin. If anyone might have been expected to meet a desperate, tragic end, back then the safe money would have been on Madonna. And yet Houston's gone, Michael Jackson's gone, Prince is semi-retired and everyone else, with the exception of U2, is making their money off nostalgia. Meanwhile, Madonna has methodically become, arguably, the greatest recording artist of all time. Who would've thunk it? As for the music, her latest CD is not breaking any new ground, but it does remind everyone who owns the ground Gaga, Rihanna, Beyonce and others are walking on. In fact, each time they receive a royalty check, they should be sending Madonna a cut. While MDNA is about three songs too long for my taste, I will tell you the first five songs make it very difficult not to want to dance, and that the track ""Gang Bang"" is pure genius. As you could probably figure out from the title, it's not radio friendly, but likely not because of what you may think. And that, in a nutshell, is why Madonna is who she is. You can tell you're watching a Woody Allen film with the first five minutes of dialogue. You can identify the beautiful prose of Toni Morrison within a couple of pages. But my 15-year-old came home one day and asked who I was listening to. I told him Madonna and my son, who loves techno and hip hop, thought I was joking. ""Seriously... like your Madonna?"" he asked. ""Yep,"" I said. ""Well, she's still old but that song's not."" The song was ""Gang Bang"" and I'm glad he left the room before she started singing. As I said, it's not radio friendly. But then again, it wouldn't be Madonna if a song like that was.

"(CNN) -- Last month, a delegation of members from the U.S. House of Representatives, which I was honored to lead, met with inspiring women of North Africa who are helping to change the world. In Cairo, Egypt; Tunis, Tunisia; and Tripoli, Libya, we held discussions with women who are committed to ensuring that women have a seat at the table and are able to succeed in this rapidly changing and strategically important region. It is an uphill climb, but there is no better time than the present. The women we met were outspoken in their belief that the new governments must be truly democratic, and that longstanding biases against full participation by women in their society must be abolished. These women came from many different backgrounds and viewpoints, yet they are aware that while their moment is now, the obstacles are great. Some had participated in the massive Arab Spring demonstrations that challenged decades of autocratic rule. Others had studied in the United States and other countries and then returned to build a future where women's voices are equal to those of men. Some are already serving in government but spoke about a need for more women to serve and to lead in forming new democracies in the Middle East. One message came through clearly in every discussion: They look to the United States as an essential partner in their efforts to build democratic societies. Women journalists played a crucial role in the overthrow of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Women are already deeply involved in rebuilding the political and economic systems of their country. Although just 10 of more than 500 members of the new parliament are women, the signal we received is that Egyptian women are committed to expanding their influence and their ranks, and to ensuring that the constitution under development will fully protect the rights of women in Egypt. Similarly in Tunisia, Deputy Speaker Mehrezia Labidi pledged to lead the effort for women's rights and secular law in her nation. Women already hold 26% of the seats in the Constituent Assembly, which is responsible for drafting Tunisia's Constitution. The determination of Tunisian women has been demonstrated outside the legislative chambers as well. In the midst of unrest at the University of Manouba, a young woman watched outraged as a zealot tore down her country's flag, and she then courageously climbed the flagpole to restore the flag to its rightful place, winning the plaudits of her countrymen. Fundamental to opening opportunities to women in public and private life is expanding their access to education. The young women with whom we met in Tripoli were unanimous in their belief that improving the quality of education for all Libyans is essential to the success of their revolution and the modernization of their country, particularly in light of the utter failure of the nation's secondary schools and universities under Moammar Gadhafi. What I heard from the women of North Africa was a refrain I have also heard in Iraq and Afghanistan and throughout the Middle East: Women and young people are weary of war. They are fed up with leaders who use ideology, religion and war to distract from the real challenges to peace, prosperity and democracy: a lack of education, a failure to provide jobs and economic opportunity, and the subjugation of women. They employed social media such as Facebook and Twitter to circumvent the repression imposed for decades by autocratic regimes and demonstrated astonishing bravery to liberate their countries from tyranny. They have succeeded in that first phase: Gadhafi, Mubarak and Tunisia's Zine el Abidine Ben Ali are gone. These young women are under no illusions about the challenges they face. They are deeply committed to building democratic societies, and they are looking to us. We cannot fail them. Leaders throughout North Africa and the Middle East must honor the role women played in freeing their countries: All their citizens -- including women -- have important contributions to make at this historic moment. That is a lesson it has taken the United States many generations to learn, but it is surely one of the most important pieces of wisdom we can share with developing democracies around the world.

"(CNN) -- It was an eerie night on the North Atlantic. The ocean, which is almost never still, was so calm that some stars could be seen reflected in the water. Thousands of stars curtained the sky -- backdrop to the immense human drama taking place. A great ship was sinking slowly into the freezing sea. Its 2,200 passengers and crew were facing desperate choices: Should I try for the lifeboats? Is that the right thing to do? And if I do manage to find a place in one, should I try to rescue other people? About 1,500 people died that night. None of the rest survive today. But the Titanic disaster has never faded from the world's imagination. That was 100 years ago: April 14 to 15, 1912. Earlier this year, the Costa Concordia struck a reef in the Mediterranean Sea, just a few feet from a resort island close to the Italian mainland. Fortunately, less than 1% of its 4,000 passengers died. The sinking of the Titanic and the wreck of the Costa Concordia had very little in common. Yet reporters drew parallels. And survivors of the January incident themselves have made the comparison, with at least one quoted as saying that it felt like ""the same type of deal."" Why? Why does the Titanic continue to be what flashes into people's minds whenever the word ""disaster"" comes up? It is virtually the only disaster that is perpetually remembered, commemorated, and even celebrated. The answer has to do with the drama of choice, not with the brute facts of the disaster itself. In 1865, the Sultana, a Mississippi riverboat, exploded and burned, with the loss of many more than 1,500 lives. In 1915, the liner Lusitania was torpedoed by a German submarine; 1,200 people died. In the same year, the steamer Eastland capsized in the Chicago River, killing 840 passengers. (Ironically, the ship had been overloaded with lifeboats, but they were useless, because the Eastland sank immediately after people boarded it.) Frightful events, and each with its own importance. But almost no one remembers the Sultana or the Eastland. And no one on the Costa Concordia is reported to have said, ""This is just like the Eastland; it's the same type of deal."" As for the Lusitania: it is remembered only as a cause of America's entry into World War I. It would be hard to find anyone who recalled a single thing that happened on the Lusitania's decks. That is not because popular movies have been made about the Titanic but not about the Lusitania. A good movie could not be made about the Lusitania itself because its sinking, like the other disasters I just mentioned, was only a scene of horror. It was not, like the Titanic, an event of permanent dramatic interest. The Titanic sank in two hours and 40 minutes, the length of a classic play. Its cast of characters included people of every rank and station and personality. The cast was large enough to represent the human race, yet small enough to form a self-contained society, in which individuals could see what other individuals were doing, and think carefully about their own responses. The Titanic had what every great drama needs: a relentless focus on the supreme choices of individual lives. Other disasters were either too big or too small to develop this kind of interest. They happened too fast, or too slowly. The great Chicago fire in 1871 and the San Francisco earthquake and fire in 1906 were tides of destruction rolling for days across large, unfocused landscapes. Today they are remembered not as dramas of individual men and women but as tests of their cities' ability to survive the forces of nature. By contrast, the Lusitania, the Sultana, and the Eastland were destroyed in just minutes. There was no time for people to assess their options; to consider what they could do, or what they should do, morally. There was no time to think about whether to take the first seat in a lifeboat or give it to someone else; to reflect on one's life and decide how to face its end. There was no time for an elderly couple, like the Titanic's Ida and Isidor Straus, to decide to refuse their places in a lifeboat, and stay together, facing certain death. There was no time for someone like J. Bruce Ismay, head of the company that operated the Titanic, to remain on deck, trying to help the rescue effort, then suddenly decide to abandon ship. There was no time to develop the sometimes inspiring, sometimes disheartening, but always memorable scenes of human life that the Titanic disaster continues to present. Only one other disaster is like the Titanic: September 11, 2001. The events of 9/11 unfolded over a similar length of time and involved communities of similarly diverse people, involved in unforgettable moments of truth. The heroic resistance of the passengers of Flight 93 and the courage of the firefighters in the Twin Towers are only two scenes from this great human drama. The Titanic and 9/11-- these disasters, these two, will continue to be remembered, not for their horror, but for what they teach us about the drama, and the dignity, of real people making the ultimate decisions of their lives. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Cox.","Stephen Cox: The sinking of the Titanic 100 years ago still holds the world's imagination .
Cox: Sultana riverboat blast, the sinking of Lusitania and Eastland aren't as gripping .

"(CNN) -- As election 2012 heats up, the question of how corporations will figure into the first presidential election post-Citizens United is a hot topic. This week, both Pepsi and Coca Cola renounced their membership in the American Legislative Exchange Council, giving us a hint of what corporate accountability might look like this election year. The companies quit the trade group, which had been pushing restrictive voter ID laws, after being targeted by prominent African-American progressive group Color of Change. With the controversial 2010 Citizens United decision, the Supreme Court declared the corporate expenditure ban unconstitutional, holding that independent expenditures could not be constitutionally limited in federal elections, and implicitly that corporations could give unlimited amounts to other groups to spend, as long as the expenditures were made independently from the supported candidate. The president criticized the move in his State of the Union address that year, and a poll shortly after the decision demonstrated that 80% of Americans, from both sides of the aisle, opposed the ruling. Subsequent polls show consistent concern about the amount of corporate money being spent in our political system. The soda giants' announcements indicate that corporate fallout in 2012 may extend well beyond ad spending enabled by Citizens United. Social media has enabled consumers to register opinions with unprecedented speed and visibility and, in the ever-competitive marketplace, companies are responding in real time. Coca-Cola announced it would leave ALEC a mere five hours after Color of Change went public with its complaint. Pepsi followed suit on Thursday. At issue are two hot-button topics: voter suppression and the ""stand your ground"" law that has been invoked as defense in the February shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Both are timely and relevant, both disproportionately affect the African-American community and both were hatched in closed-door sessions at ALEC meetings. ALEC is not a new group; it predates the Citizens United decision by almost four decades. ALEC brings together corporations, conservative think-tanks and Republican legislators to collaborate on model legislation generally introduced through state houses. The voter ID laws at the center of the controversy have passed several state houses and face challenges from the Justice Department for racial bias. An estimated third of African-Americans do not hold state registered identification, so would be prevented from voting under these laws. Voting rights advocates claim these laws would effectively keep millions of Americans from the polls. Yet studies show that voter fraud is exceedingly rare and where it does exist, it is not likely to be remedied by instituting ID laws. This sharp protest against ALEC laws comes on the heels of the institution being spotlighted for its role in the stand your ground legislation at the center of the Trayvon Martin tragedy. Stand your ground was unveiled by the National Rifle Association at a 2005 ALEC gathering and since the initial meeting, 24 states have passed the law. News: NRA's role with ALEC . Americans generally co-exist peacefully with the corporations whose activities pervade our daily lives. There is a mutually recognized symbiotic relationship. But, at a time when American confidence in government is at an all-time low, voters have little tolerance for displays of affinity between elected officials and powerful corporate interests. Early on in the Republican primary, presumed nominee Mitt Romney was skewered for a response to a question at the Iowa State Fair, where he proclaimed, ""Corporations are people."" This is a sentiment almost 60% of Americans disagree with, and it reinforces that Romney's history of wealth and corporate elitism put him out of touch with the common concerns of most Americans and casts doubt on where his loyalty would lie if elected. Coke and Pepsi are hardly the first to face the wrath of disgruntled citizens. In 2010, Target Corp. came under intense fire after Minnesota campaign disclosure laws revealed that it had given a contribution on behalf of Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Emmer. Emmer was known as a social conservative who opposed civil rights for gay and lesbian people and opposed immigration reform. Weeks of backlash followed, included demonstrations at more than 1,000 Target stores nationwide, hundreds of thousands of petition signatures and an intense social media campaign. In the race to command the marketplace through brand loyalty, the corporations' own marketing strategies can make them vulnerable to consumer backlash. Target had positioned itself as the family friendly, all-American department store. It was a place people could feel good shopping after Wal-Mart became a target for its union busting. Similarly, ""Have a Coke and a Smile"" doesn't fit as a slogan for a company involved in robbing Americans of their democratic right to vote. Color of Change is a perfect emissary to Coke. The company established a dedicated marketing group for African-Americans in 2006 and just this year promoted a campaign targeting black teens to celebrate Black History Month. So, Color of Change represents a critical business demographic and its concerns must be taken seriously. Republican leaders have and will continue to cry foul about these kinds of efforts. However, as 2012 unfolds, we'll see more of them. These campaigns have become the embodiment of democratic principles in a country where consumer choices matter and the government is seen as too close to corporate interests. This power of the pocketbook has the potential to invigorate the free market by investing more people in its outcome and to crowd-source our cultural norms by reflecting the values of a diverse country. This is something all Americans should embrace.

"Amsterdam, Netherlands (CNN) -- The problem has become so complicated, that perhaps only a child can solve it. An 11-year-old Dutch boy, Jurre Hermans, entered a serious economics competition with a plan for bringing the Greek economy back from the brink. In the end, Hermans, the youngest ever to enter the Wolfson Economics Prize, received a 100 euro voucher for his original idea -- conceived on the notion of exchanging debt for slices of pizza. Maybe Washington can invite him for some budget brainstorming. Meanwhile, Europe's crisis goes on, still in need of creative solutions. Beyond the placid old Amsterdam canals, the bustling bike lanes and the quaint tulip fields, roils a furious debate about the future of the Netherlands. On the surface, the issue is what to do about the budget deficit. In reality, it is about whose life will become more difficult. Who will pay more? Who will receive less? It is a question coming soon to a deficit-spending country near you: the United States. In other parts of Europe, in places like Greece and Spain, similar discussions have toppled several governments and have escalated into huge, sometimes violent  protests, as people lash out in frustration against government decisions they find intolerable. I believe that some time next year, with the election in the past, when either Barack Obama has started his second term or Mitt Romney has finished unpacking in the White House, Americans, too, will discover that budget debates are not just academic exercises or political theater. It's a good bet that just as Europe has come up against the reality that deficits cannot grow forever, so too will America. Investors, who have taken losses in the European debacle, will start looking at America's books, questioning its solvency, and demanding change. The European economic crisis has unfolded most dramatically in Greece, where the economy has plunged into a depression. With its budget deficit and national debt rising out of control, the Greek government sought help from the eurozone, where rich countries demanded stark austerity measures in exchange for a bailout. Greece, like other countries in Europe, had given up its own currency in exchange for the euro, so it did not have the option of printing more money or devaluing the currency to pull itself out of the mess created in part by politicians who gave voters what they wanted without troubling to bring up the unpleasant fact that someone, sooner or later, would have to pay. Today, the Greek people are enduring economic pain that makes America look like a paradise of prosperity. Unemployment stands at 21%, wages are collapsing for both government and private sector workers. A series of new taxes have been imposed, including a ""solidarity"" tax, new property taxes and higher self-employment taxes. The VAT, a national sales tax on all transactions, has jumped from 13% to 23%. The minimum wage has been been sharply cut. Poverty has increased dramatically. After all that, Greece is still required by European rules to cut another 4.7% of gross domestic product from its budget, equivalent to the United States suddenly cutting more than $700 billion. Even if it achieves those goals, or rather because it will enact such draconian cuts, the Greek economy is expected to sink deeper. The European economic pact requires countries to keep their budget deficits below 3% of GDP. That became increasingly difficult as the world entered a recession. In Greece's case, the government had been concealing its deficit spending. In other countries, especially those that relied heavily on real estate, home prices collapsed, and tax revenues declined, opening up the budget gap. The Dutch economy, one of the healthier ones, now faces a 4.6% deficit. There's talk of across-the-board pay freezes and even more social safety-net cuts, among other ideas. Unemployment is just 6%, but the country has returned to recession. In Spain, the government wants to avoid requiring a bailout the way Greece, Ireland and Portugal have. The newly-installed government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy needs to slash the budget by 5.5% of GDP, even more than Greece. Spain expects unemployment, already the worst in the developed world, to go over 24% this year, about the same experienced by the United States during the Great Depression. The European crisis is far from over, but it already has important lessons for the United States, where federal deficit figures are treated as poison darts to be thrown among politicians, rather than as an important problem needing adult solutions. The top three lessons from Europe are these: . â€¢ Deficits matter and sooner or later will have to be cut . â€¢ Trying to cut deficits in the middle of a recession makes the recession worse . â€¢ When the cutting starts, it will cause major social and political upheaval, as well as very real pain. Unlike most European countries, the United States has the luxury of printing money and borrowing almost at will. The crisis in Europe has actually made it more attractive to lend to the United States, so it's easy to pretend the deficit and the debt don't matter. But America's deficit of about 10% of GDP and debt of $15 trillion, roughly 100% of GDP, cannot go on forever. Interest payments on the debt already consume more than $200 billion each year, and the debt is rising at blinding speed. The United States was right to deal with the recession first before tackling the longer term problem. Europe is proving what the Hoover administration already showed in the 1930s, that cutting spending in a recession is counter-productive. But, with the economy recovering, the time will soon come for the difficult decisions: Will the government cut defense spending, Social Security, or Medicare? Or perhaps other programs that keep millions out of poverty? In the Netherlands, the ruling coalition has been brought to the edge of collapse over the choices. The far-right politician Geert Wilders demanded huge reductions in foreign aid. There is also talk of ending the mortgage tax deduction, along with other tax increases. Social services have been reduced and food banks say they have seen an ""explosion"" in the number of clients. And the government is still looking for more cuts. The choices go to the heart of a nation's character. Voters in the United States should insistently demand that presidential candidates say exactly what they will do about the deficit. They should also demand that politicians at long last resolve -- not just debate -- the problem. Will politicians behave responsibly? If you hear anyone say tax cuts alone will get the economy growing and fix the problem, don't believe it. Economists say spending cuts and tax increases are necessary. If adults won't face up to the truth, maybe it's time to bring in the children for new ideas, and for a reminder of what's at stake. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: The pain of budget cutbacks is being felt in many parts of Europe .
She says in reality the decisions are about who will pay more -- and receive less .

"(CNN) -- It is always important to look back on historical moments in history and remember how it was and reflect on those who made it possible. But it is also vital to continue having a forward-looking vision that connects the past with the present. When veterans of the civil rights movement and those who weren't even alive in the 1960s pick a date and gather in Washington to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, a lot will be said about the past. Rep. John Lewis of Georgia is the only surviving speaker on the official part of the program, and others who witnessed the speech are older and grayer but still among us. It must have been an unbelievable sight to see about 250,000 people before the Lincoln Memorial to gather for jobs and freedom for African-Americans on August 28, 1963. We remember the march because of the massive audience as well as the culmination of that day, the riveting speech of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who delivered what is known today as the ""I Have a Dream"" speech. During that moment in history, the heavy hand of Jim Crow was oppressive for African-Americans all across America but especially for those living under the brutality in the South. Voting was virtually nonexistent. Blacks couldn't eat in public places like hotels and restaurants. But what the march largely focused on was the economic condition of African-Americans. When most folks think about the march, too much focus is on the ""I Have a Dream"" portion of King's speech and not the top two-thirds, which was a condemnation of the economic policies that stifled black growth in America. ""One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination,"" King said. ""One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition."" What many people forget is that in the final year of his life, King was planning the Poor People's Campaign, looking to focus the nation on its poorest citizens. King confidant Harry Belafonte told me last year for an interview on my TV One show, ""Washington Watch,"" that King understood that black America, and all Americans, couldn't be truly free unless they had economic freedom. A lot has changed for black America since August 28, 1963, but when you examine the economic condition in 2013, we are still facing troubled times. As America has desperately tried to escape the recession that gripped the world over the past few years, black unemployment remains pathetically high. Overall, the unemployment rate announced in March was 7.7%. For African-Americans, it was 13.8%. Black teen unemployment was 43.1%. The wealth gap between whites and blacks is even wider today than it has been in three decades. According to a recent report (PDF) released by Brandeis University, the wealth gap between whites and black increased from $85,000 to $236,500 between 1984 and 2009. The median net worth of white families is now $265,000, and it's $28,500 for black families. The Brandeis study says there are five vital factors for this: number of years owning a home, average family income, college education, employment stability, and financial support from families and inheritance. Many will read this and say, ""Oh, please! Get an education, find a good job, work hard, and all will be well."" But it's not as simple as that. When you look at the state of education where African-Americans largely live, resources play a crucial role in all of this. The lack of a quality education plays a role in what college you're able to attend, and that will determine what kind of job you will have. The long-term racial policies of America have also played a role. The failure of black families being able to go to college for decades in the 20th century, as well as access to good-paying jobs, has played a role in the inability of blacks to pass down wealth from one generation to another. All of these factors are why a commemoration of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom shouldn't be a big love-fest for folks focused on civil rights. It should be singularly focused on driving an agenda that speaks to the unemployment crisis afflicting black America. Those who are planning events around the march shouldn't fall into the easy trap of letting any and everyone bring their agenda in August. The beauty of the 1963 march is that it was narrow, specific and designed to address a critical need. If organizers today want to really walk in the footsteps of those in 1963, they should go back and study why they all met in the first place. The agenda was set in 1963 on jobs and income inequality. In 2013, this generation should pick up that baton and run with it so that the next time there is a commemoration, we will be celebrating how successful we were in addressing and fixing the problem. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin: The 50th anniversary of the March on Washington is coming up .
Martin: In two-thirds of the ""I Have a Dream"" speech, King focused on economic issues .
Today, black unemployment is high, and black income levels are low, he says .
Martin: In commemorating the march, organizers must focus on economic challenges ."
