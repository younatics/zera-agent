"Once the choice was between a quick espresso or soothing chai latte, hot chocolate or cool frappuccino. But now you can add a glass of shiraz and a bottle of beer to your Starbucks order. US coffee giant Starbucks is now making in-roads into restaurant territory with its latest venture, Starbucks Evenings. The chain, which has more than 700 outlets in the UK, is offering a range of hot and cold meals as well as wines and beers to customers to be served from 4pm. The newly renovated Stansted Airport in Essex is the first UK location to offer the evening menu with plans to expand the programme to additional stores. Starbucks UK is launching an evening menu offering ten types of wine plus hot and cold small plates . Prawn and chorizo skewers with basil, cherry tomatoes and a smoky chilli ketchup (left) and truffle mac and cheese topped with crispy breadcrumbs (right) The wine list has ten bottles on offer; one sparkling, one rose, four whites and four reds. There is also Peroni Nastro Azzuro and Magners Original Cider on offer. The food menu has five vegetarian options including vegetable crudites, stone-baked flatbreads and truffle mac and cheese. There is also a cheeseboard featuring Somerset Brie, Cheddar, and Blue Stilton. For meat-eaters there is  chorizo and prawn skewers with chilli ketchup, braised British beef or pulled pork with chilli. There is currently only one dessert option, a warm chocolate brownie with chocolate and caramel sauce topped with whipped cream . Ian Cranna, vice president of marketing  for Starbucks EMEA said: 'We are delighted to launch the first Evenings Programme in the UK. Somerset Brie, Cheddar and Blue Stilton cheese platter with oat cakes and aromatic plum chutney . 'Providing a welcoming coffeehouse environment has always been our focus and now we can offer something new for the evening too. 'I think our customers will love the new range of terrific food and carefully selected wines and beers which will provide even more choice and reasons to visit us later in the day.' Simon Smith, CEO, UK and Ireland for SSP UK, commented: 'We are delighted to support our partner Starbucks with the new Evenings Programme at Stansted Airport. 'Starbucks is a brand which is synonymous with great coffee and introducing this programme will tempt our coffee lovers to experience a new range of delicious foods and carefully selected alcoholic beverages in our newly renovated store.' However, its move into the UK alcohol market was criticised by charities last night who expressed concern that such a large firm is licensing some premises. Emily Robinson, of Alcohol Concern, said: ‘We hope Starbucks will take their responsibility as an alcohol retailer very seriously by ensuring the training of staff and under-age checks are adequate, and that responsible drinking is encouraged. 'It’s a bit disappointing to see another establishment now selling booze which will limit those customers who are in recovery or just wanting an alcohol-free environment.’ There are currently no plans to offer spirits as part of Starbucks Evenings Programme. Regular Starbucks food and drink favourites will continue to be made available throughout the evening. All wine and beer will be served for in-store consumption only. In US stores, Starbucks Evenings has proven very popular and has rolled out to 30 locations in Seattle, Portland, Southern California, Chicago and Atlanta. Victoria Gould, retail expert at Jones Lang LaSalle, predicted that Starbucks will roll out the evenings programme in tourist hotspots to widen the company’s appeal. She said: ‘Starbucks are aiming to elongate their trading day. Where better to trial this in the UK than at an airport? Airports have some of the longest trading hours but also a captive audience that wants to eat and drink as a priority.’ The company has yet to reveal prices for each item. Small plates .

"A minister of a sect who claimed he was 'Christ in the flesh' handpicked 10 young girls and forced them to have sex with him for nearly a decade, two of his alleged victims have said. Victor A. Barnard, 52, is on the run after authorities in Pine County, Minnesota announced that he faces 59 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct involving the two women - although he could face more if other alleged victims come forward. A nationwide warrant was issued on April 11 but authorities believe followers of his sect, the River Road Fellowship, may be hiding him in Washington state. After enduring years of abuse, Lindsey Tornambe escaped the group of 140 followers and alerted authorities to the girls' plight. Another former cult-member, Jess Schweiss, told authorities her story. Scroll down for video . 'Brainwashed': Young women gather around Victor A. Barnard, the leader of an alleged cult who is wanted for allegedly repeatedly sexually assaulting the girls, whom he called his 'Maidens' The women say they were just 12 and 13 when, with their parents permission, they went to live with Barnard as part of a group of 10 women known as the Maidens, Fox9 reported. The Maidens, aged between 12 and 24, were first-born daughters handed over to Bernard and forced to have sex with him anywhere between once and five times a month over a decade. He said that Jesus and King Solomon had many women followers, so 'God's word' meant that it was normal for him to have sex with them. 'I still had a conscience, I knew it was . wrong,' Schweiss, who marked every sexual encounter with Barnard with an 'x' on a calendar, told Fox. Her father told authorities that he 'felt pressured to not say anything' about the sexual activity, according to the criminal complaint. Brave: Lindsey Tornambe said her parents took her to Barnard's home when she was 13 and she was left there for nearly a decade. She contacted authorities in 2012 about the abuse . Lost childhood: Jess Schweiss said she was just 12 when she was picked by Barnard to be one of his Maidens . Former lives: The girls, pictured when they were part of the group, said there were 10 Maidens . Schweiss has now cut her parents out of her life. 'I don't look at them as my parents . anymore,' she said. 'They weren't the parents I wanted or needed. My . parents, the people I grew up with as a child, don't exist anymore.' Speaking with the Star Tribune, Tornambe said she still remembers sitting in the congregation with her parents in 2000 when she was called by Bernard to a 'position of honor'. After her parents dutifully left her at his ranch, she said Bernard began talking to her about sex and grew angry when she said she did not understand the terms he was using. He had sex with her anyway and urged her not to tell anyone, she said. She added that her parents rarely came to visit, even though they lived just five miles away. Claims: Barnard told the women they should have sex with him because it was consistent with God's word . On the run: Police have a nationwide warrant out for his arrest but believe cult members are hiding him . Shunned: Weiss said that her parents, pictured, dismissed her claims that she had been sexually assaulted . She left his cabin when she was 15 but after her parents berated her with their disappointment and Bernard spoke to her about damnation, she reluctantly returned. 'I was really scared, and I didn’t know what receiving damnation from God would be like,' she said. 'I ended up just staying.' But a few years later, she left permanently and went to live with her parents, who had moved to Pennsylvania. They still placed Bernard's photographs around their home. When she told her parents about the abuse, her mother 'did not want to hear it', the criminal complaint notes. Tornambe eventually became a nanny, but when she heard cousins happily talking about their lives at a New Year's party in 2012, she realized Bernard had robbed her of hers and she called police. Scene: The River Road Fellowship had land in Minnesota before the claims surfaced and they fled west . Likewise, Schweiss split from the group and moved to Wisconsin in September 2009, but she said she attempted suicide in 2011. When her brother confronted her, she told him about the abuse. 'I feel bad in one sense that I am taking Victor's life away from him by putting him behind bars, but then again, he took my life away from me, which I should have had,' she said. 'So, I feel that - for lack of better words - I think I'm even.' Tornambe adeed: 'I definitely don't want Victor hurting anyone else.' Pine County Chief Sheriff’s Deputy Steven Blackwell said that the 59 counts only relate to the claims by the two women and that authorities are hopeful more will come forward. When asked if he believed there were more, he said: 'I don’t know how we couldn't think that.' See below for video . KMSP-TV .","Police are seeking Victor A.

"The stunning photograph of a man lulling his arthritic dog to sleep in Lake Superior has touched so many people that John Unger, 49, and his dog Schoep, 19, have started a foundation to help other dogs in need. The Schoep Legacy Foundation has raised more than $25,000 to help low-income families care for their aging dogs thanks to donations from people as far away as Saudi Arabia and Japan, all inspired by the gorgeous image. Mr Unger's good friend Hannah Stonehouse Hudson, who is a professional photographer, captured the heartbreaking moment between the man and his aging rescue dog in Wisconsin when Mr Unger thought his best friend was at the end of his life. But thanks to the generosity of strangers, Schoep has been receiving top-notch care and is wagging his tail more than ever before, allowing Mr Unger and his dog more time together. Inspiration: The stunning photograph of John Unger and his dog Schoep in Lake Superior touched people, who sent money for the arthritic dog. The animal has now died . Giving: The Schoep Legacy Foundation has raised more than $25,000 to help low-income families care for their aging dogs thanks to donations from people as far away as Saudi Arabia and Japan . 'Schoep is doing incredible right now,' Mr Unger said to MailOnline. 'The therapies that the people have donated - it's like turning back the clock a year and a half.' Dr Erik Haukass, Schoep's veterinarian, said that the 19-year-old dog is doing very well and that they are optimistic the treatments will allow Mr Unger and Schoep many more months. 'Without treatment, John and I were talking about euthanasia at the end of July,' Dr Haukass said. He was on the front line when the donations to Schoep's care came in, shocked by their magnitude. 'I've never seen anything like this before,' he said. 'We realized we had received more money than we would reasonably spend on Schoep's care.' Dip: Thanks to the generosity of strangers, Schoep received top-notch care in the last few weeks of his life . Together: Dr Erik Haukass, Schoep's veterinarian, said that the 19-year-old dog is doing very well and that they are optimistic the treatments will allow Mr Unger and Schoep many more months . Owner Mr Unger, photographer Mrs Hudson, and veterinarian Dr Haukass formed Schoep's Legacy Foundation . Together with Mr Unger and Mrs Hudson, the three formed Schoep's Legacy Foundation. 'The idea is to pay it forward; give it to other organizations, to help out other animals in the area and use the money in the spirit it was given,' Dr Haukass said. The elderly dog that touched millions of hearts around the world has died aged 20 . The $25,000 will be used in a variety of ways to help low-income families care for their animals, both in the care of older pets and the spaying and neutering of new pets. 'It could help another 30 or 40 Schoeps,' Dr Haukass said. 'It's incredible to be in a position to help others,' Mr Unger said. But beyond helping other animals, Mr Unger said that he's found himself counseling people who have had to deal with a devastating loss in their lives. Along with donations, people have been sending Mr Unger their personal stories of woe. 'They're going through some depression of their own. They're very deep and emotional letters. Those are the ones that hit home a lot,' Mr Unger said. 'But they look at the picture that Hannah took and it helps them have a better time with it. That's pretty extraordinary.' Mr Unger knows first hand about love and loss. He and his ex-fiancée adopted Schoep 19 years ago, but when the relationship ended, Mr Unger was on the brink of suicide. 'To be honest with you, I don’t think I’d be here if I didn’t have Schoep with me (that night). He just snapped me out of it. I don’t know how to explain it. He just snapped me out of it. … I just want to do whatever I can for this dog because he basically saved my ass,' he said. Beginning: Mr Unger adopted Schoep, who is named after a famous brand of Wisconsin ice cream, when he was just a puppy . John . Unger, 49, adopted Schoep, who is named after a famous brand of . Wisconsin ice cream, when he was just a puppy and it was love at first . sight. Buddies: Schoep and Mr Unger have been together for 19 years . He and his ex-fiancée had been searching for a rescue dog for a year, going to dozens of humane societies. 'We wanted every single dog,' Mr Unger said to the MailOnline. 'We just hadn't found the right one.' His then-fiancée they spotted the pup at the Ozaukee Animal Shelter 19 years ago. 'We fell in love with her immediately,' Mr Unger told the MailOnline. Schoep . was in a cage with another dog, possibly his mother, crouched in the . back quietly staring at the corner with his back to Mr Unger. 'I knew - that's him,' Mr Unger said. At the time Schoep was named Tramp by the shelter staff and showed signs of abuse. 'He didn't even know what toys were,' Mr Unger said. 'I really wanted this dog because I wanted him to enjoy life.' The couple worked hard to establish the trust of the dog and eventually brought out its 'full potential'. Sleepy: He and his ex-fiancée had been searching for a rescue dog for a year, going to dozens of humane societies . Adopted: Schoep was in a cage with another dog, possibly his mother, crouched in the back quietly staring at the corner with his back to Mr Unger . Vintage: At the time Schoep was named Tramp by the shelter staff and showed signs of abuse . When Schoep was in so much pain, it is Mr Unger's time to return the favor. Suffering from excruciating arthritis, the animal was not sleeping through the night and could barely walk. ‘Schoep falls asleep every night when he is carried into the lake. The buoyancy of the water soothes his arthritic bones. Lake Superior is very warm right now, so the temp of the water is perfect,' Mrs Hudson explained. Mr Unger could not afford the costly treatments, which at $200 dollars a session, would ease Schoep's pain. But after Mrs Hudson's photograph traveled across the world, thousands of dollars came pouring in. Treatment: Schoep has been getting joint laser treatments, which reduce pain and swelling while healing the animal's limbs, as well as pain medication from the Bay Area Animal Hospital . Gift: 'He's walking so much faster,' Mr Unger said. 'His stride, his gait, is longer. It's unbelievable' Friends: 'He sleeps through the night. He's interested in going for more walks during the day,' Dr Haukass said. 'He walks with less of a limp. His ears are standing up and his tail is wagging better' 'We didn't expect any of this,' Mr Unger said. 'Then, when the donations did start coming in for his care, they didn't stop.' Schoep has been getting joint laser treatments, which reduce pain and swelling while healing the animal's limbs, as well as pain medication from the Bay Area Animal Hospital. 'He's walking so much faster,' Mr Unger said. 'His stride, his gait, is longer. It's unbelievable.' Dr Haukass has also seen a change in the animal. 'He sleeps through the night. He's interested in going for more walks during the day,' Dr Haukass said. 'He walks with less of a limp. His ears are standing up and his tail is wagging better.' 'I took Schoep in for a check up because he was limping,' Mr Unger said. The doctor recommend pain medication, but said that it may be temporary or not help at all. Inspired: This image has touched thousands . Then, Mr Unger said, the doctor told him, ' ""If there isn't any improvement, we should probably..."" a good vet wont say ""put him down,"" but he said at that point I may start to want to think about it.' Faced with the possibility of losing his best friend, he called up Mrs Hudson for an impromptu session. She met the pair at sunset on Lake Superior, because Schoep's cataracts prevent him from seeing in sunlight. 'She couldn't believe he fell asleep in my arms,' Mr Unger said. Mrs Hudson watched the man and his dog float around the lake for maybe five minutes before Schoep began to get cold and shake. Mr Unger said he had to take him out of the water to let him warm up and was worried she hadn't had the chance to snap an image. 'I didn't think she even took one picture,' he said. 'But then she told me she got what she wanted.'","A few months ago, Schoep, 19, was in so much pain John Unger, 49, thought he was close to the end .

"A romantic getaway to Paris was ruined for one couple after easyJet refused to accept one of their passports - despite it still having a year to run. Megan Meenan, 23, and her partner Adam Clarke, 25, from Derry, Northern Ireland, had booked a three-day trip to the French capital and were scheduled to fly out from Belfast Airport on Tuesday. After passing through security and checking in their luggage, they had made it to the gate when they were asked to show their passports. A romantic trip to Paris for Adam Clarke and his partner Megan Meenan was ruined when easyJet refused to accept the former's passport . After Miss Meenan was allowed to walk through to board the plane, Mr Clarke was told there was a problem with his passport. An easyJet member staff called their manager four times to discuss the matter. Miss Meenan then claims the manager requested a second opinion from a worker who 'looked about 21' and Mr Clarke was told he wouldn't be permitted to board. This was despite Mr Clarke's passport, which is the old British style issued nine years ago, still having a year to run until it expired. The AXA Insurance worker has used the passport on Norwegian, Ryanair, Thomson and an easyJet flight in the last 12 months. Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Miss Meenan said: 'Four times the manager was contacted, but I find it bad that they couldn't even come down and inspect for themselves. 'They asked first to see some more ID, which Adam showed them his drivers' licence, and they agreed it was definitely him. Adam Clarke's passport photo and the copy inside is clear and visible, but the front is, as his partner Megan Meenan accepts, 'tatty' 'When the manager asked for a second opinion, I overheard the staff member saying that they 'wouldn't accept it'. 'The passport is nine years old and obviously looks a bit tatty, but it clearly shows who he is and isn't falling apart. 'To add insult to the situation, I was told I could proceed as there was no problem with my passport.' Miss Meenan, who was travelling to Paris for the first time, describes how the incident had left her in tears, and she demanded to see the manager. Sadly for Adam and Megan, they never got to enjoy their romantic trip to Paris . 'As we were going to see the manager, I could see the plane taking off and I was just so upset,' she added. 'When we met them, we were told as a ""goodwill gesture"" that we could re-book flights for later in the day for £65 each, but that they 'couldn't guarantee' Adam's passport would be accepted. 'So instead of walking around Paris, and going through all the activities we planned, we were instead going back home.' University of Ulster Masters student Miss Heenan told MailOnline Travel that  in correspondence with easyJet since the incident the airline has incorrectly called them 'Agnes and Andy' and has offered a goodwill gesture of airport taxes back - £54, minus £10 for processing the form. 'They said the passport had looked like it had been through a washing machine, but it hadn't,' added Miss Meenan. 'EasyJet have told us they are standing by what their ground staff said, which I find very upsetting. 'When you are sitting at the gate, you never think it could be you who misses the flight in tears, but that was what happened.' A spokesperson for easyJet said: 'easyJet works closely with the authorities and complies with their guidance to ensure the safety and security of all passengers and staff. 'easyJet cannot allow any passenger to travel on their planned flight with documentation damaged to such a degree that its authenticity is brought into question. It is the passenger's responsibility to have suitable documentation for travel.'

"I’ve just met a guy online and we really clicked but he turns out to be a 32-year-old virgin! He’s attractive and it makes me wonder if he’s damaged in some way… . He doesn’t want sex and we’ve been dating for three months. What’s going on? Is it secretly gay? He says he’s a virgin but I don’t believe him… . Two unusual emails plopping into my inbox? Or an indication of something that’s more common than you think. The answer is the latter. Society views men as sex-crazed – willing, able and ready to have sex with anything that stands still for longer than a minute - but in reality, it’s easier for an older man to end up a virgin than you think. Accidental virgins tend to morph into terrified virgins. He starts off feeling a little hung up about it then it becomes a big deal (posed by model) Sometimes it’s deliberate: for religious or moral reasons, some men don’t believe in sex before marriage. Others see it as something special and don't want it diluted with several partners or want to marry a virgin and figure if they expect her to be, they should be too. For others, it’s accidental: this guy simply missed the point when everyone else did ‘it’.  Maybe his girlfriend was less keen on putting out than other girls. Maybe he was less sure of what to do, so didn’t push it. Maybe he was shy or didn’t find it that easy to get a girlfriend until much later than everyone else. The end result is the same: he’s still a virgin and all his friends aren’t. Accidental virgins tend to morph into terrified virgins. He starts off feeling a little hung up about it then it becomes a big deal. Terrified he’ll embarrass himself, he avoids making any sexual advances at all. Girls aren’t used to men not wanting to sleep with them so he quickly gets a reputation of being ‘a bit weird’ or ‘gay’ and before he knows it, he’s scared of dating and sex. Add porn to the mix. It’s so readily available and prolific, men no longer need to go out and pursue women to satisfy themselves sexually. Why should they when they can stay at home and explore all their sexual fantasies online with no risk of rejection or ridicule? Romantic relationships are stressful to lots of men. It was bad enough being an 18-year-old virgin, being a 30 or 40-year-old one seems unbearable. Older male virgins look to their partner to teach them and with time and patience, could mould into your idea of the perfect lover . The longer a guy stays a virgin, the more difficult it becomes to lose it. He becomes adept at hiding what feels like a hideous secret, loses all confidence and suddenly he’s landed where he is now - fast approaching middle-age without ever having had sexual intercourse. Should you go there if you come across this guy? Some women claim being the first to introduce a man to the pleasures of sex is the ultimate in sexual head-games, a lusty sensation unlike anything else they've experienced. Virgins pay attention and listen. There are a lot of guys out there who think they're great lovers - but they're not. Tell them they're doing something wrong and they get offended. With a virgin, it's usually different. They look to their partner to teach them and with time and patience, could mould into your idea of the perfect lover! But sleeping with a virgin is a risk emotionally because it’s common for male virgins to move on quickly once they have done the deed. 'I associate my first time with embarrassment, feeling inadequate and shameful. I’d rather forget the person who witnessed that,' said one man who lost his virginity at 34. Proceed - but with caution. Read more of Tracey's advice on her Femail blog here .

"Former boxing promoter Kellie Maloney has returned to the ringside for the first time since her sex-change operation. The 61-year-old was back ringside on Friday night, a day before she revealed that she was considering a return to the sport. She was invited to the bouts by boxing promoter John Pegg, and was said to be scouting for talent ahead of her possible return. Former boxing promoter Kellie Maloney has returned to the ringside for the first time since her sex-change . Ms Maloney (middle) revealed that she was having a sex-change in August last year . Ms Maloney was enjoying herself as she watched eight matches at Villa Park in Birmingham . White Dee joined Ms Maloney ringside as the close friends met for an evening of sport in Birmingham . Maloney attended the fight night with close friend White Dee. Ms Maloney, formerly known as Frank, helped Lennox Lewis become world heavyweight champion and retired from the sport in 2013. She shocked the world of boxing in August last year by announcing her decision to change her sex and live as a woman. Ms Maloney, formerly known as Frank, helped Lennox Lewis become world heavyweight champion . Ms Maloney said she was considering applying to have her promoter's licence reinstated after two years . The 61-year-old looked on intently as she watched her first live boxing match since retiring in 2013 . Maloney has already undergone hormone therapy, electrolysis to remove excess body hair, counselling and voice coaching. She also underwent facial construction surgery in November, which went drastically wrong when she stopped breathing. The procedure left Ms Maloney, who has three daughters from two marriages, with a severely swollen face and the former promoter revealed that she thought her head would 'explode' after the agonising surgery. She has since recovered and looked to be enjoying her evening at the boxing on Friday night, tweeting that she was 'ringside with lovely Dee' as she watched eight matches. The visit inspired a possible return to boxing for Ms Maloney, who on Saturday revealed that she was considering applying to have her promoter's licence reinstated. Her highly successful career, which spanned more than 30 years, saw her manage five boxers to world titles as well as many more British, European and Commonwealth champions. 'I would love to go back and prove that Kellie can achieve the same thing Frank achieved,' she told BBC Radio 5 live. 'If I feel like it, I think I will apply for my licence.'

Duva is one of the few women to hold a managerial role in boxing and Ms Maloney was grateful for her insight. 'I've been over to New York, met with Kathy and we've chatted and she's told me to go for it, so I'm really considering it,' she said. Ms Maloney also revealed that it was a difficult decision to go public about her sex change last year. 'Transitioning is a very hard thing and a very personal thing and I believe you've got to do it. Frank was a very unhappy person, if I tell the truth.'","Kellie Maloney was seen watching boxing with her close friend White Dee .

"Tax bill: Millionaire Michael Rockall, pictured with wife Gillian, claimed he needed a £6million yacht to impress his clients to avoid paying income tax on it . A millionaire who claimed he needed a £6million yacht to impress his clients has been ordered to pay tax on their luxury items after a tribunal ruled he personally benefited from the boat. Michael Rockall, a former Barclays Bank executive turned entrepreneur, said his lavish lifestyle, which included buying diamond jewellery for his wife and daughter, was vital to 'convey the right image' to clients. However, he now faces a hefty tax bill after the First-Tier Tax Tribunal ruled that he and wife Gillian must pay income tax on their fringe benefits. After leaving Barclays, Mr Rockall, 70, . set up a flourishing hotel and executive training business centred on . two stately homes, Scalford Hall, in Melton Mowbray, and Whittlebury . Hall, near the Silverstone motor racing circuit.

Judge Brooks ruled that Mr and Mrs Rockall had also enjoyed a personal . benefit from the yacht, jewellery and clocks which, whilst owned by . their companies, had been 'placed at their disposal for their use'.

"A shotgun once owned by Wild West sharpshooter Annie Oakley is expected to fetch at least £60,000 at auction. Oakley was just 25 when she literally shot herself to fame as the top attraction in Buffalo Bill Cody’s travelling Wild West show. She drew huge crowds with her remarkable skills. Her most famous trick was shooting a playing card facing side-on, then hitting the pieces again as they fell to the floor –from 90ft away. Annie Oakley 'Western Girl': A 130-year-old shotgun once wielded by famed Wild West gunslinger Annie Oakley has emerged for sale for nearly $100,000 . The 1893 16-gauge Parker hammer shotgun is thought to be Oakley’s first proper gun and came to be one of her favourites. She used it to wow audiences around the world for 20 years before retiring from the show to take up acting. During her time on the road she performed for dignitaries including Queen Victoria and Kaiser Wilhelm II. She was so sure of her talent that for one daring stunt she shot the Kaiser’s cigarette from his mouth. Annie Oakley's shotgun: The gun once wielded by famed the Wild West gunslinger is on sale . Annie Oakley's rifle shoulder strap: This is what the Wild West gunslinger carried her gun in . Following the outbreak of the First World War, she wrote a letter to the Kaiser requesting a second shot but he didn’t reply. Oakley retired in 1913 and died in Ohio in 1926 aged 66. Also up for sale is Oakley’s treasured charm bracelet boasting trinkets from her admirers including one from Buffalo Bill. Experts have tipped both the gun and the charm bracelet to fetch about $97,000 each when they go under the hammer. They are being sold by Oakley’s great grand niece Bess Edwards, 90, who in 1984 established the Annie Oakley Foundation in her memory. 'Annie Oakley is remembered as an incredibly talented trick shooter who was the star performer with Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show for almost 20 years. Tom Slater, an expert in Americana at auctioneers Heritage, said. 'She was so popular that arguably she made Buffalo Bill’s show famous, not the other way round. 'Annie was skilled with a gun from an early age and was named Little Sure Shot by Native American chief Sitting Bull who also toured with the show. 'She would use all manner of guns in her act but she favored shotguns because their scatter-spray meant it was slightly easier to hit targets. 'She bought this gun in 1883 and there is no evidence of her owning a gun before this one. 'Parker guns were the best you could get and she used this gun throughout her time with the Wild West show. Group shot: Annie Oakley (circled standing) with Buffalo Bill (circled seated) and Nate Salsbury to his right. Behind them, along with cowboy Tom Webb is little Benny Irving, half Lakota and 'the smallest cowboy in the world', and the camp matron, Ma Whitaker .

'On her return to the US she had the gun restocked to the specifications he suggested. 'Following her death the gun was passed on to her family and has now been consigned by her great grand niece Bess Edwards. 'Bess is now 90 and she has decided it is time to pass these historical items onto someone else.' The auction will take place in Dallas, Texas, tomorrow.

"Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge only started dancing after scoring because his favourite celebration of pulling his shirt over his head would get him yellow carded after every goal. The England international made his first appearance in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday following a five-month absence, and took just 12 minutes to score as Liverpool beat West Ham 2-0. Sturridge used the trademark celebration on his highly-anticipated return at Anfield but the 25-year-old has exclusively explained it only came about because of a change in the rules.

'If a player removes his jersey or shirt over his head or covers his head with his jersey or shirt when celebrating a goal.' Sturridge, when asked by BBC Match of the Day magazine if he'd missed his celebration, said: 'I don't need to work on that, it comes naturally! I might switch it up, though. 'Back in the day the best celebration was the shirt over the head, but now that's a yellow card – that's how this one started. 'It's been a long time and I was just desperate to get back out there and help my team win some games – that's really the most important thing for me. 'It's the worst experience - watching from the sidelines when you're a player. 'But it helps you mentally and I feel like I've improved as a person. I'm enjoying it more and I'm just happy to be back playing.' Sturridge has been helpless as Liverpool's bid to win their first Premier League title falls flat this season after finishing second behind champions Manchester City last year. The striker has  seen captain Steven Gerrard announce he will be ending his 26-year association with the club at the end of the season, and Sturridge admits he took the news hard.

Liverpool were knocked out of the Capital One Cup semi-final by Chelsea but remain in the FA Cup, though they must see off Bolton  in their fourth-round replay at the Macron Stadium on Wednesday. The competition may represent Liverpool's final chance for silverware this year, but Sturridge is not jumping to conclusions just yet.

"An image of Manchester United's potential new home shirt for next season has started to do the rounds on Twitter. German manufacturers adidas are designing their first Manchester United kit after signing a staggering world-record deal to replace sportswear rivals Nike. An apparent leaked Manchester United shirt for next season is doing the rounds on Twitter . Manchester United will end their 13-year deal with Nike at the end of the current campaign . Louis van Gaal is expected to benefit from Manchester United's adidas kit deal . However Sportsmail understands the image of the apparent new design, which is spreading across social media, is not the new design as it will be released later this year. Manchester United signed a kit deal worth an incredible £750million to team up with adidas from the start of next season. Louis van Gaal's side will end their lengthy affiliation with Nike, which has seen the American company design the Premier League club's official sportswear for the last 13 years. United said back in July: ‘Manchester United has reached a 10-year agreement with adidas for a global technical sponsorship and dual branded licensing deal for a minimum guarantee of £750m, subject to certain adjustments.' Van Gaal, who brought in the likes of Angel di Maria, Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw in the summer, is likely to benefit from United's kit deal with adidas by being handed another hefty summer war-chest. Real Madrid - Real’s agreement with adidas, which runs until 2020, was widely reported to be the most lucrative in world football before United announced their deal with the same firm. Barcelona - Barcelona announced in 2007 that their deal with Nike, initially signed in 2006, was being extended until the end of the 2017-18 season. The original contract was worth a minimum of £24million a year. Arsenal - This is the first season of Arsenal’s deal with Puma, which was announced in January as the biggest contract in both parties’ history. Chelsea - Chelsea and adidas signed a 10-year deal last June worth almost £300million. Man City - City switched from local firm Umbro to Nike last season in a six-year deal announced in May 2012. Liverpool - In January 2012, Liverpool announced a six-year agreement with American firm Warrior. The deal is reportedly worth £25million a year to the Reds. Warrior general manager Richard Wright said at the time: 'We are here to shake up the world of football.' Bayern Munich - Bayern Munich and adidas extended their collaboration beyond the 50-year mark with a new deal in 2011 that runs until 2020. Adidas also owns a stake in the club. England - The Football Association ended a 60-year association with Umbro by switching to Nike. A five-year deal to run from 2013 to 2018 was announced in September 2012. The figure was not made public but the FA described it as 'a substantial investment'.' NFL - Nike replaced Reebok as the official supplier of kit to the National Football League in 2012 in a five-year deal that is the most lucrative in US sport.","Adidas will produce the Manchester United kit for the 2015-16 season .

"Supporter: Alan Duncan MP said the couple should have a right to defend their property . Two alleged burglars shot during a break-in have both now been discharged from hospital and put in police custody, officers revealed today. And homeowners Andy Ferrie, 35, and his wife Tracey, 43,  who were arrested on suspicion of grievous . bodily harm, are still being held, it also emerged. Police were given extra time to question the couple who were arrested after dialling 999 in the early hours of Sunday when their . home near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, was broken into by four men. Businessman Mr Ferrie, who runs a . mobile home and caravan repair business, has told police he fired a . legally-owned shotgun at the alleged intruders, injuring two. At around the same time, one of the injured men called an ambulance, and the second man later admitted himself to hospital. Now police say the 27-year-old man was discharged from hospital this afternoon and are now in police custody. A spokesman said: 'The two men who did attend hospital, aged 33 and 27 years old, are now in police custody for questioning.' As the couple remained in custody, their local MP, Tory Alan Duncan, spoke out in support of them, declaring they were the ‘victims’ and should be free to defend their property. International development minister Mr Duncan argued: ‘If this is a straightforward case of someone using a shotgun to defend themselves against burglars in the dead of night, then I would hope that the police will prosecute the burglars and not my constituents. ‘The householder is the victim here  and justice should support them and prosecute the burglars.’ The two men and two alleged accomplices were all arrested at the hospital and the pair’s injuries are not life-threatening. Analysis: Leicestershire Police cordoned off the stone cottage, which had reportedly been burgled several times already . Taking notes: Police were first called to the property shortly after midnight on September 2, by homeowner Mr Ferrie . Last night, Mr and Mrs Ferrie were still being held by police, more than 36 hours after the terrifying raid. The case comes as the Government . prepares to introduce legislation to clarify the law on a homeowner’s . right to defend their property from intruders. The debate first rose to . prominence in 1999 when farmer Tony Martin shot dead 16-year-old Fred . Barras at his Norfolk home. The farmer received a life sentence . for murder at Norwich Crown Court in April 2000, but this was reduced by . the Appeal Court to five years for manslaughter and he was released in . 2003. Last night the millionaire businessman . who led the campaign against the conviction of Mr Martin said the . arrest of the Ferries showed the rights of homeowners were still . unclear. Police examine a shotgun after attending reports of a shooting at the 200-year-old property . Mr and Mrs Ferrie were held after suspected burglars were shot at their home . Police stand at the front door of the property as they attend the scene of the shooting at Melton Mowbray . Malcolm Starr added: ‘I do not think . people should suffer the trauma of being arrested and held in a police . station when they are visited by uninvited people in the middle of the . night. The benefit of the doubt should lie with them.’ Magistrates yesterday granted . Leicestershire Police an extra 36 hours to question the Ferries, along . with the four men aged 27, 23, 31 and 33 who are being held on suspicion . of aggravated burglary. A police community support officer stands guard at a track near the isolated cottage . Mr Ferrie’s mother, Susan Spilner, 56, . from Uppingham, Rutland, said the couple had been the victims of . burglaries three or four times previously. ‘One of them was quite nasty,’ she added. ‘They have not been injured but property has been stolen.’ The couple first rented the cottage in Welby between 2001 and 2006 before buying their own home in Melton Mowbray. But they moved back to the cottage . this summer while they arranged a move to Australia, which is planned . for next year. They decided to emigrate to a warmer climate because Mr . Ferrie suffers from stiff joints. The hamlet where the cottage is . located consists of just a church and handful of farm buildings and . cottages. Mr Ferrie’s stepfather Maris Spilner, 60, said his step-son was a ‘decent man’. He said the shooting was ‘out of character’ but added: ‘If someone breaks into your home, it’s a violation of your privacy.’ Mr Ferrie’s father Joseph, from . Syston, Leicester, added: ‘Andy and Tracey are law-abiding people who . have never been in trouble before. ‘They live in the country – there are . rats and all sorts and it is not unusual to own a shotgun. They would . have been asleep in their beds, perhaps they heard the dogs barking and . reacted. They must have been frightened. Anybody would be in that . situation.’ Lyn Codwallader, a former neighbour . who lived in Welby at the same time as the Ferries during their first . stay in the hamlet, said the remote spot was an ‘easy target’ for . burglars. ‘We moved in on the Saturday and were . burgled by the Monday,’ she added. ‘They [Mr and Mrs Ferrie] were broken . into as well that week and that was years ago. It is because it is in . the middle of nowhere.’ The four suspected burglars, aged 23, 27, 31, and 33, were all arrested at Leicester Royal Infirmary . Melton Mowbray was described by residents as a quiet, rural community . Announcing plans to clarify the . legislation into the issue in June last year, Justice Secretary Kenneth . Clarke said people were entitled to use ‘whatever force necessary’ to . protect themselves and their homes from intruders. His statement came shortly after Peter . Flanagan, a 59-year-old engineer, was arrested on suspicion of murder . after stabbing to death an armed burglar in Salford. Mr Flanagan was . later released without charge after prosecutors said they were satisfied . he had acted ‘in self-defence’. The following month, grandfather Cecil . Coley, 72, was freed without charge after he stabbed an armed raider to . death when a gang smashed their way into his florist’s shop in Old . Trafford, Manchester. A Ministry of Justice spokesman  said . that legislation in the Legal Aid,  Sentencing and Punishment of . Offenders Bill, which comes into force later this  year, ‘clarifies that . if you do react instinctively to repel an intruder you will not be . punished for it – as long as you use reasonable force’.

"A nine-year-old boy has been given a new pair of ears – made from his ribs. Kieran Sorkin was teased at school after being born deaf and with nothing but small lobes where his ears should have been. He ‘always wanted big ears’ and now surgeons at Great Ormond Street Hospital have granted his wish. Scroll down for video . Before and after: Keiran Sorkin was born deaf and without ears but surgeons have gifted him a new pair, sculpted from his rib cartilage . In a six-hour operation they took cartilage from ribs in his chest and sculpted it into a perfect pair of ears. On seeing the result in a ‘side-selfie’ -a photograph of the side of his head that his parents helped him take - all he could say was ‘Wow’. Kieran’s father, David Sorkin, said: ‘We’re absolutely on cloud nine. We could not have wished for a better result. Impressed: On seeing the result in a 'side-selfie' -a photograph of the side of his head that his parents helped him take - all he could say was 'Wow' ‘They look like normal ears, he had nothing but has got proper sized ears now and they cover the gap where ears should have been. They look normal bar a couple of sewing marks which will go away in time. ‘His reaction was just a “wow”, he is very happy.; . Kieran, of Bushey, in Hertfordshire, was born with a rare condition called bilateral microtia in which the ears are missing or deformed.  Unusually, both of his ears were affected. He was teased at school and found that other children were more interested in asking about his looks than making friends. His parents said he wanted to look like everyone and before last Tuesday’s (AUG 5th) operation, he said: ‘I’ve always wanted big ears and now I’m finally going to have them’. During the op, plastic and reconstructive surgeon Neil Bulstrode, took rib cartilage from both sides of Kieran’s chest and then carved and shaped it into frameworks for Kieran’s ears. Rare: Kieran, of Bushey, (pictured with his father David) in Hertfordshire, was born with a rare condition called bilateral microtia in which the ears are missing or deformed . Thrilled: Kieran (centre) with his father David, mother Louise and sister Mia. Kieran is very happy with the results of his operation . An outline of Mrs Sorkin’s ears served as a template. The surgeon then grafted the ears onto Kieran’s head under pockets of skin and then used a vacuum to shape the skin to over the contours. Doing both ears at the same time helped ensure they were a match. Mr Bulstrode said. ‘This allows us to ensure the ears are balanced and achieve the best result . ‘It’s a major operation but it brings a significant improvement in quality of life for children with microtia. Their confidence improves exponentially and their performance at school improves. ‘If you can improve a young person’s confidence, you can alter their whole trajectory in life.’ Mr Sorkin, a 44-year-old IT manager said: ‘It’s been heart-wrenching for us and we’ve had the moral dilemma all along of whether it’s right to change the features that Kieran was born with. ‘But Kieran has talked about having ear surgery ever since the age of six when he saw a TV programme about it.’ The operation was largely cosmetic. However, thanks to previous surgery and a hearing aid, Kieran can ‘hear the wind blow and the birds tweet’. He should be able to go back to school after the holidays and bar one follow-up operation in the winter, he should not need any more surgery. Up to 40 children a year are given new ears at Great Ormond Street, although only five or so will need both ears replaced.","Keiran Sorkin was born with bilateral microtia which affected both ears .

"Millions of Americans, including academics, activists and celebrities, have warned British families not to be drawn into a ‘Frankenstein Food’ experiment. A coalition of 57 million people have signed an open letter to British consumers highlighting potential harm to human health and the environment caused by genetically modified crops. Signatories include health, consumer and farming groups as well as Susan Sarandon, Daryl Hannah and Robert Kennedy Jnr. The Downing Street delegation lef tto right: Pat Thomas, Beyond GM, fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, chef Val Warner, US campaigners Diana Reeves and Pamm Larry with Michael Meacher MP . The campaign is designed to counter the pro-GM campaign that has been mounted by the Government and the biotech industry, which is intended to open up Britain to GM crops and food. The US government and the European Commission are negotiating a free trade treaty – known as TTIP – which would increase the flow of American GM food into Britain and Europe. Already, more American foods containing GM ingredients are being found in British stores, despite the fact that most have pledged not to use them in own-label products. The Daily Mail revealed over the weekend how Marks & Spencer is selling six imported foods, including cookies and sauces, containing GM. Others are selling big brand American products, such as Reese and some Oreo lines, containing GM. Separately, the government has been pressing the EU to allow Britain to grow GM crops even if other nations chose to ban them. This could allow commercial planting to in six to 18 months. The letter was delivered to Downing Street yesterday by a delegation including campaigners, the designer Vivienne Westwood, the chef Valentine Warner and former Labour environment secretary, Michael Meacher. Actors Susan Sarandon (pictured left) and Jeremy Irons (right) are among the 57 million people who have signed the letter . It argues that health concerns remain over the safety of GM crops, most of which are grown in partnership with the powerful weedkiller glyphosate, also known as Roundup. Some animal studies have linked GM and glyphosate to damage to the liver and kidneys, reproductive abnormalities, and even tumours. These findings have been rejected by the industry and the European Food Safety Authority. GM ingredients are now in 70 per cent of processed foods in the US. Critics point out that traces of glyphosate have been found in drinking water and the breast milk and urine of American mothers. Levels in the breast milk were claimed to be around 1,600 times higher than is currently allowed in European drinking water. The letter argues that GM crops have never delivered on promises to increase yields and profits or to decrease pesticide use. Pesticide use can be 24 per cent higher amongst GM farmers, which has harmed insects and bees. The population of the Monarch butterfly, for example, has dropped by over 80 per cent in some parts of the US. This is because Roundup kills milkweed, which is the Monarch’s key food source. There is also evidence that weeds have evolved to become immune to glyphosate, making them difficult and expensive to remove. Raj Patel, Research Professor at the University of Texas, said: ‘We have superweeds, and farmers are suffering. The public health cost is unknowable, not least because scientists themselves are afraid to criticise the industry. ‘Far too little is known about about GMOs, and what little we've been able to glean demonstrates it has little to offer, beyond profits for chemical companies.’ Susan Sarandon said: ‘Instead of bringing certainty and security, GM organisms have raised more and more worrying questions about their effectiveness, their necessity, and even their safety. Polls show that the majority of US citizens – and in fact citizens everywhere – either want them labelled or taken out of the food system altogether.’ The delegation pictured at Downing Street yesterday, handing over an open letter from 57 million Americans warning British people of the dangers of GM food and farming . Actor Jeremy Irons said: ‘I believe the biotech companies who produce the seeds and herbicides have not proved the safety of their food production methods, and are concerned in cornering the food market while showing no concern for the long term effects of their production methods. ‘They are immensely wealthy and influential, and I believe we must stand up to the enormous pressure they are putting on Governments and farmers in the UK and around the world to commercialise the growing of seeds.’ Pat Thomas, the campaign director for British group, Beyond GM, said: ‘The American experience of GM shines a light on how our own food future will unfold if we continue to race pell-mell down the road to a genetically modified Britain. ‘It’s time the public was brought back into the debate about what they eat, and what they feed their children, and it’s time politicians and regulators started listening.’ The biotech industry said GM crops and food have been proven safe, while offering benefits to farmers. Dr Julian Little, chairman of the industry’s Agricultural Biotechnology Council, said: ‘The plant biotechnology industry takes product safety regarding biotech food and feed very seriously and is committed to the highest standards of testing for its products.’ He said a European Commission report published in 2011, which looked at 130 research projects, concluded ‘there is, as of today, no scientific evidence associating GMOs with higher risks for the environment or for food and feed safety than conventional plants and organisms.' He added: ‘An estimated three trillion meals containing GM ingredients have been eaten around the world over the last 17 years without a single substantiated case of ill-health. ‘The World Health Organisation has said that: ‘No effects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of such foods.'","Coalition of 57 million people have signed open letter to British consumers .

"A kitten that has no front legs after being reportedly hit by a weed whacker is thriving -- and steadily gaining fans on Facebook.

As of this time, Mercury's page has 9,350 likes on the social media website. Scroll down for video . Mercury the kitten, seen here, reportedly lost his front limbs after an accident with a weed whacker . Found with his eyes closed and only 4 days old in September 2013, Mercury was taken in and eventually adopted by his new owners . 'We believe he was hit with a weed whacker since people in the neighbourhood had been doing yard work in tall grass shortly before he was found,' they write. 'He was taken to our vet, his wounds were cleaned up, and we were then called to care for him since we do a lot of bottle babies and special needs kitties for rescues. We fed him around the clock, and cleaned his wounds multiple times a day until they fully closed over.' Though they had considered giving Mercury up for adoption, they decided they 'simply cannot part with him.' Mercury has developed his hind legs, they write, and is able to use them to push himself, balance upright, and jump. Despite not being able to use his now-amputated front limbs, Mercury's hind legs have developed an allow a wide range of movement . Mercury's Facebook page run by his owners, Raising Mercury, currently has 9,350 likes . Mercury's right arm stops just before where his elbow would be and his left arm extends slightly after it, they explain. His front limbs reportedly cause him no pain.  His left rear foot only has one toe. Mercury's owners say he is not a candidate for a prothestic leg on either front limb, since he would need at least 40% of the limb intact. After he stops growing, he may be eligible for a front wheel chair. However, they say he would also need a harness and that his limited chest muscles might prevent it from working. Mercury is expected to attend adoption events to help raise awareness of cats with disabilities, and his owners say they hope for him to one day become a therapy cat.

"Photographer Annie Leibovitz has finally sold her massive townhouse in Manhattan's West Village for $28.5million. 'It is a good price, consistent with other big homes that have sold in the neighborhood — which is hot,' a broker told Page Six today of Ms Leibovitz's sale. The compound of three separate townhouses had been relisted in April at $29million, down from $33million when it originally hit the market last December. Photographers lair: Ms Leibovitz was forced to cut the price of her West Village home, which she lived in for a decade, by $4million to $29million after no buyers came forward . Million dollar mansion: Ms Leibovitz's old compound, which she sold for $28.5million in January 2014, is composed of three separate townhouses - one for living, one for office  space and one as guest quarters . The home's buyer appears to have hidden their identity behind an LLC called 755 Greenwich LLC - befittingly the address of the property. A labor of love, Ms Leibovitz, 63, . created the 10,200 square-foot compound over a decade ago after purchasing the three buildings for $6.1million, and . gut-renovating them. Icon: Ms Leibovitz is best known for her portraits of celebrities such as a Nicole Kidman, Brad Pitt, a pregnant Demi Moore . She used one for living, one for office space and one as guest quarters. The trio of properties all surround a slate patio and private courtyard garden. The brick buildings, which Ms Leibovitz began assembling in 2002, date back to the 1830s, and include a total of seven bedrooms, five-and-a-half bathrooms, and 13 fireplaces in all. Touching upon Ms Leibovitz's recent financial troubles that almost laded her in bankruptcy, a source told Page Six: 'This deal is another step toward her financial recovery. It is another step in the right direction.' Ms . Leibovitz is best known for her portraits of celebrities such as a Nicole . Kidman, Brad Pitt, a pregnant Demi Moore, and even the Queen. However in 2009, she . was sued over a dispute over the terms of a loan repayment that . involved her townhouses and photo archives, which creditors claimed she . had put up as collateral, and saw her narrowly miss having to file for . bankruptcy. A breach of . contract lawsuit was filed against Ms Leibovitz by Art Capital Group for . $24 million regarding the repayment of a $15.5million loan that she . took after experiencing multiple financial challenges. Greek Revival style: The brick buildings date back to the 1830s, and include 13 fireplaces in all, with a combined total of more than 10,200 square feet . Labor of love: Ms Leibovitz, 63, created the compound after she purchased all three buildings on the corner of Greenwich Street in Manhattan for $6.1million, and gut-renovated all three homes . In a short matter of time Ms Leibovitz lost . her . father, mother, and her long-time partner, Susan Sontag, while . simultaneously welcoming twins into her family, and bankrolling the . renovation of her three . West Village properties. However . Art Capital Group withdrew its lawsuit against Ms Leibovitz a few . months later in 2009 and extended the due date for repayment of the $24 . million loan. The compound's sale would likely cover a majority of what Ms Leibovitz still must repay. 'It’s a big step on her road to financial recovery,' a source said. 'She waited long enough and made a really good deal.'

"A first-grade student whose best friend is battling cancer decided that hours of playing and telling jokes was not enough - he wanted to show his buddy just how he understood the tough time he was going through. Five-year-old Vincent Butterfield decided the only way was to shave his head in support of his best friend Zac Gossage who lost his hair through chemotherapy. Zac was diagnosed last June with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He is undergoing treatment but still goes to Union Central Elementary in Missouri every day - because that's where he gets to hang out with Vincent. Scroll down for video .

When the little boy was asked why he shaved his hair off, he told KSDK: 'To make Zac feel like he’s not the only one without any hair.' Vincent has also been learning about cancer and raising money for his best friend after learning how expensive his chemotherapy treatments are. He made more than 20 scarves and sold them, raising more than $200 to give to Zac. The little boy's mom Karen Butterfield told KDSK: 'We had been making these scarves and he just kind of said it would be . cool if we could make a whole bunch of these and sell them.' When asked what friendship was, Vincent looked at his friend Zac and responded: 'It's a beautiful thing.' Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a fast-growing cancer of the white blood cells.

"A Michigan man has erected a giant bronze sculture of a hand with its middle finger raised in the direction of his neighbor - who also happens to be his ex-wife. Alan Markovitz, 59, a Detroit strip-club entrepreneur, erected the 12-foot-high, spot-lit sculpture in the backyard of his lakefront Orchard Lake home. A person who appears to be the daughter of Markovitz's ex-wife Lea Tuohy tweeted about the sculpture. Flipped: The sculpture stands on the back porch of Alan Markovitz's home . 'How psychotic do you have to be to buy the house directly next to your ex wife and then put a statue up like that?!?! Real classy alan,' Lenka Tuohy tweeted November 11. Stripped bare: Markovitz bought the house directly next door to his ex-wife but says he's totally over her . According to the Detroit Free Press, Alan Markovitz moved into the home with his daughter Tiffany. Markovitz is a well-known character around Detroit. He began opening strip clubs on Detroit's infamous Eight Mile in the 1980s. Since then, he's been shot twice (once in the face), had a Mob contract out on his life, sued by exotic dancers and, according to Real Detroit Weekly, once had an ex-girlfriend drive her Pontiac Fiero through the front door of one of his clubs. A self-penned book about his adventures, Topless Prophet: The True Story of America's Most Successful Gentleman's Club Entrepreneur, was published in 2009. His latest endeavor is am HBO/Cinemax reality show called Topless Prophet, which is slated to air early next year. Deadline Detroit reports that Markovitz was married for two years to a woman who he says was cheating on him with someone he knew. Well-lit: There's no escaping the sculpture, which Markovitz has a spotlight trained on when it's dark . Neighbors: Lenka Tuohy (right) and her mother Lea Tuohy (left) can see the sculpture from their back windows . She reportedly moved in with the man after she and Markovitz had split up. 'I'm so over her,' Markovitz told Deadline Detroit. 'This is about him. This is about him not being a man.' When a friend tweeted that Alan's gesture was making him 'look like an idiot,' Tuohy concurred: 'Like lol someone's not over my momma!' According to Deadline Detroit, the sculpture cost $7,000.

"Christina Regusters, 21, is on trial on charges of kidnapping, aggravated assault and rape . A 19-year-old daycare worker has been charged with the kidnapping and rape of a 5-year-old girl who was abducted from her elementary school after the woman allegedly claimed to be the girl's mother. Police say Christina Regusters covered herself in a black Muslim veil, similar to one the girl’s mother wears, when she pulled the child from her Philadelphia classroom last month and walked her to a nearby home. Regusters, who worked at an after-school care program the girl attended, is charged with kidnapping, rape, conspiracy, aggravated assault and several related offenses according to police. The girl was discovered shivering . half-naked on a playground about a mile from the school the morning . after her abduction on January 14. The . girl told a passerby, 'I've been stolen' and repeatedly spoke of a . talking bird inside the home that would 'peck her eyes out' if she . didn't stay hiding under a bed, philly.com reports. That talking bird proved crucial in police’s investigation, said Attorney Tom Kline who's representing the girl and her mother. Regusters, . who told the child her name was Tiffany, was one of four residents . questioned on Thursday at the home several blocks from Bryant Elementary . School in west Philadelphia. The other three were released. The 5-year-old victim was signed out at this Philadelphia school by a woman claiming to be her mother. She was missing for the next 20 hours . 'The investigation is very much active and ongoing,' said Special Victims Unit Capt. John Darby at a news conference on Thursday. The girl retraced her steps with police, leading them to the home with the bird according to authorities. 'This brave, innocent precious little . girl was instrumental in leading police literally to the door of the . crime,' said Kline in an interview on Friday. 'She told them that there was a bird in the house. The bird became one of the many focal points of the investigation,' he added. Kline . said the girl suffered 'terrible, horrible injuries' and that the . family was 'grateful' for the arrest, but knows it isn't the end of the . line. The child was discovered the next day, about 4:40am, after a man walking by heard her screams from this playground . Investigators believe after the suspect and victim successfully walked a few blocks to the home a man was waiting. The child was blindfolded, told to remove her clothes and put on a black, adult-sized T-shirt, and then ordered to hide under a bed, authorities said. DNA on that shirt is said to have been found connected to something in the house. 'There is still more work to be done,' Kline said adding that there were clearly additional people involved. 'We are watching anxiously the next developments because this is not the end of the line.' Regusters' attorney, W. Fred Harrison Jr., told WCAU-TV Regusters had 'no involvement' in the crime. Authorities believe she was dumped about 18 hours later at the park before found by a passerby who hear her screaming. Fear: The child told police that she was taken to a nearby house with a talking bird whose owner said would peck her eyes out if she didn't stay hiding under a bed . The child was hiding under a jungle . gym play set around 4.40am and it was unclear how long she had been outside. She was . freezing, as it was about 37 degrees outside and damp from rain the . night before. Nelson Mandela Myers who found her that morning said he asked where her parents were. 'She said, ""I don't know. Somebody . was chasing me. I ran,"" Myers said. 'She said she came from South . Philly. I knew something was wrong, because I knew she couldn't have run . from South Philly.' 'As he . starts to walk to where the screams are, a little girls runs out,' Upper Darby Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood told Philly.com. 'She said, ""I ran away, I ran away from the people who took me.""' The child was immediately taken to a nearby hospital to get checked out. News of the girl’s abduction sent waves through both the community and the school where the girl was successfully released to the woman without photo ID shown. About a week after the principal at the school was removed among four people held responsible for the horrific ordeal. The girl had been abducted from her school around 8:50am by a woman dressed in a burkha who called herself 'Tiffany' District officials . said the incident violated school procedure, which requires anyone . signing a child out of school to show ID and be on a list of as a . verified parent or guardian. Allowing . the girl to leave school with an unknown adult was a 'serious break in . procedure,' District spokesman Fernando Gallard said. The . woman didn't wait at the school's front office, as is policy, but went . to Robinson's classroom and told a teacher that the child had already . been 'checked out' of school. Robinson was not reported as missing until 3 p.m., when a caretaker from the child's after-school program came to pick her up. Her mother appeared on local media tearfully pleading for her safe return, and explaining how . she also wears the traditional chador and niqab - the type of clothing . that Robinson's abductor was wearing. The playground where the girl was found is adjacent to a baseball field and a residential neighborhood, where police focused their search for her abductors .","Police say Christina Regusters covered herself in a black Muslim veil similar to the girl’s mother when she signed the girl out of school .

"Researchers from the University of Illinois have discovered that Protestants who suppress sexual feelings and anger are more artistic and creative than Catholics and Jews . Protestants are more creative than Catholics and Jews, new research has found. Researchers from the University of Illinois wanted to test a previously-held theory that introverted people who suppress emotions about sex and depravity are more creative than people who are more open and extroverted. They discovered that Protestants, or people who grow up in a Protestant communities, can channel suppressed emotions more effectively than their Catholic and Jewish counterparts. The research, led by Emily Kim along with Veronika Zeppenfeld and Dov Cohen, claims that its not that Jews and Catholics don't suppress the same feelings about sexual taboos as Protestants, but they channel it into feelings of guilt, rather than through art or creative means. The team of researchers from Illinois began by analysing a Californian study by Freud and Weber that began in the 1920s, which wanted to test if there was a connection between high IQs, creativity and religion. Freud and Weber interviewed participants when they were children and repeated these interviews over the following decades. During the 1950s, the researchers asked specific questions about whether the participants . had 'any . major problems or marked difficulties related to sex', as well as being . asked to list any creative accomplishments they had achieved. Kim and her colleagues used these questions to conduct experiments on 127 'religious' men. Of the participants, 60 were white Protestants, 40 were white Jews, . and 27 were Latino Catholics. The researchers said they excluded white Catholics because this group 'would be much more intermixed with, and . influenced by, the wider Protestant culture'. Some of the men were given a photo album and told to imagine the images in the album were members of their family. One of the images of a sister-type figure showed an attractive woman in a bikini designed to make the participants feel sexually uncomfortable. A second experiment involved participants being asked to write about their family before being told to create a clay sculpture and then write a poem. The results found . that 'Protestants produced more creative artwork (sculptures, poems, . collages, cartoon captions) when they were primed with . damnation-related words, induced to feel unacceptable sexual . desires, or forced to suppress their anger.' Researchers asked men of different religions to suppress their emotions, before being asked to sculpt or write a poem. Although Protestants were more creative, the study claims Catholics and Jews already have adequate ways to absolve guilt caused by these feelings, in confession booths, pictured, for example . Yet the researchers added that . activating anger or sexual attraction wasn't enough to cause the . creativity, and that these feelings had to be suppressed in one form or . another to give 'the emotion its creative power.' Kim et al said: 'Protestants who had major problems or marked difficulties related to . sexual taboos and depravity anxieties showed greater creative . achievements in their lives. 'They had more publications . and creative accomplishments in other areas (and also) disproportionately chose jobs in the most creative occupations. 'Neither . of these results held for Catholic and Jewish participants.' The paper goes on to say that Protestant participants were more likely to include sexual and phallic symbols in their artwork, too. During a third test, 42 Protestants and 54 Catholic or Jewish students were to told to focus on repressing anger. Half of them were told to recall a time in their life when they had been 'very angry' and were asked to visualise how they wanted to hurt the person who had made them angry. They were additionally told to make a fist with their hand while they wrote about the incident. The other half had to recall an event where they didn't feel overly happy, sad or angry. Famous protestant artwork includes Hans Holbein the Younger's Noli me tangere, pictured, which is a rare Protestant oil painting of Jesus Christ . They were then told to create captions for five cartoons, which were later judged based on their wit and creativity. Kim said: 'Without this suppression manipulation, Protestants in the other conditions scored about the same as Catholic and Jewish participants.' One reason why the researchers believe the Catholics and Jews didn't show the same level of creative flair was because they 'seemed to show greater guilt reactions' during the tests. The researchers said: 'Both Judaism and Catholicism have formal institutions and rituals that allow a person to atone for and repent one’s sins. Alternatively, Protestants apparently don't have this method of channeling their anger and therefore needed a way 'to work through their forbidden emotions.' The team of researchers from Illinois . began by analysing a study by Sigmund Freud and Max Weber that began in the 1920s in . California. This study wanted to test if there was a connection between . high IQs, religion and religion's role in creativity. Freud and Weber interviewed . participants when they were children, during the 1920s, and repeated . these interviews over the following decades. During the 1950s the researchers asked specific questions about whether they . had 'any . major problems or marked difficulties related to sex', as well as being . asked to list any creative accomplishments they had achieved. This was the first indication that . intelligence made people more creative, but a person's religious beliefs . could hinder or develop this creativity. The more religious participants in the study were found to be more creative. Protestants disproportionately chose jobs in the most create industries, too. These questions formed the basis of the Illinois study.","Researchers carried out experiments on men of different religions .

"Step into the eerie world of underground living, where residents have built their very own homes and businesses into the chalky clay rocks in the Australian outback. The mining town of Coober Pedy in South Australia's far north, comes complete with churches, museums, art galleries, a bar and even hotels for travellers to get the underground life first-hand. Underneath the  moon-like landscape, 3500 residents are living in dugouts or mud caves, with all amenities of a home above ground, including walk-in closets, modern kitchens and televisions. The culturally diverse town is known for supplying the world with the majority of gem quality opal, which is their main source of income. Living in one of the world's most inhospitable regions, the stony desert has climbed to extreme temperatures of up to 50 degrees in the day and dropping to zero at night. The town water supply comes from an underground source 24 kilometres north of the town, situated 840 kilometres north of Adelaide. Around 150 million years ago, Coober Pedy was once an ocean but after the water receded, the sandy silica minerals from the seabed flowed into the rocky cracks and solidified over time, which turned into multi-coloured gem stone opals. The mining town is home to the world's hottest golf course but to make up the arid conditions, players carry their own patch of artificial grass to minimise damage to their clubs on the parched, stony ground. In 1915, miners began to living underground, commonly known as dugouts, to escape the heat of summer and winter's cool desert nights. Another attraction to the town includes the annual events of the Coober Pedy OZ Mineral Races, Queen of the Desert Festival and the Opal Festival. Every year, residents come together to celebrate the end of summer with raffles, parades and outdoor activities for all ages. Coober Pedy has attracted many film-makers and appeared in movies including 'Fire in the stone', 'Pitch black', 'Red Planet' as well as an episode appearance in reality TV series 'Amazing Race'.

Earlier Kirsty Gardner, one of the BBC film crew, had written about the excitement among her colleagues about the journey. 'In just a few minutes we set sail for . the Titanic wreck site,' she wrote on Twitter before leaving Ireland. Yesterday dozens were queuing up for sea sickness tablets outside the . medical centre as many struggled to cope with the choppy conditions. The Met Office said that sea conditions off the coast of southern Ireland were 'rough or very rough'. The Balmoral continued its delayed journey late last night. From the wreck site, it will go to . Nova Scotia, where some of the Titanic's victims are buried, and then on . to New York, the destination the ship never reached. A spokesman for the Titanic Memorial Cruise said: 'A guest has been taken ill on board the Titanic Memorial Cruise . . . 'Once the guest is off the ship for medical treatment the cruise will resume as scheduled.'

A minute's silence was also held today in remembrance of the 1517 passengers and crew who lost their lives on the famous liner's ill-dated maiden voyage. The south coast city has special reason to mark the Titanic disaster, as 538 of the 714 crew who died on the ship hailed from Southampton.

At the time it was said that almost every person in the city was either related to or knew someone who died. Events began just before midday when nine wreaths were thrown into the Ocean Docks at Southampton, Hants, where most of the crew had lived. The minute’s silence was concluded by a haunting recording of the Titanic’s whistle which was sounded three times around the port. Every vessel in the port then proceeded to sound their whistles in sombre acknowledgement. Shortly after, a re-enactment of the ship’s departure from berth 44 at Ocean Dock on April 10 1912 was staged. Poignant: The south coast city has a particular connection to the Titanic disaster, as four in five crewmembers on the ship hailed from Southampton . Commemorative roses line the water between the two births where the Titanic originally set off from on April 10 1912 . A flotilla of craft followed the tug tender Calshot, which was built in the same era as the legendary liner, as it sailed towards the Solent. Guests were then invited to throw their own rose off the dockside in memory of loved ones who lost their lives. One of many to throw a rose into the water at the dock was Alan Stote, who was paying respects to his great uncle Thomas Instance. Pensioner Mr Stote, 76, of Totton near Southampton, Hampshire, said: 'My grandfather’s brother was only 31 when he lost his life. 'He was a fireman aboard the Titanic. Although very upsetting, today’s event was well organised and very professional. 'I feel lucky to have been able to be a part of the day and pay my respects.'

"The owners of a Yorkshire terrier measuring just five inches tall and seven inches long believe she may be the smallest in the country. Three-year-old Pagan is so small that she nearly died once when the whippet she lives with yawned and caught the terrier's head in her mouth. Owner Brenda Wheeldon, 72, from Hull, says her pet is too small to use a lead on, so she pushes the dog around in a tiny doll's pram. Pagan the Yorkie is so small she travels around her hometown Hull in a pink and leopard-print doll's pram . Mrs Wheeldon said that when she first got Pagan, the dog was so tiny she took her to the vet because she feared she wasn't growing properly. But she says the vet told her the dog, who eats well but weighs less than three pounds, was perfectly healthy, just small. She said the only health problems the dog has suffered cane when the whippet she lives with yawned and got the dog's tiny head stuck in its mouth. Mrs Wheeldon said: 'The vet was really worried and she was almost put down twice but made a miraculous recovery. 'It's amazing that she's still with us and, although we have to be careful with her head, she's back to normal. Pagan, who is smaller than a chihuahua,  has a wardrobe full of tiny, hand-made dog clothes to keep her warm, and has become quite a canine celebrity due to her diminutive size. Not for sale: Pagan's owner Brenda Wheeldon, from Hull, has been offered up to £1,000 for her but said no . Mrs Wheeldon's daughter Paula Windstanley, 47, said: 'You can't take her to a market on a lead because she'd get squashed. She's too small. 'Everyone always wants to take photographs of her and she loves it.' Mrs Wheeldon said Pagan was particularly popular with men, rather than women, and said she has been offered up to £1,000 for the dog. But she's not selling. Write caption here . She said: 'Pagan is such a character and although some Yorkshire terriers are quite snappy, she usually isn't. 'She also loves children and my two great-granddaughters love her.  She likes to lie back and have her tummy tickled and she always runs upstairs to bed. 'People say I should enter her into competitions and maybe I will - I always watch Crufts.' Mrs Wheeldon added: 'I don't believe I have ever seen a dog smaller than Pagan - she could be the smallest in the country.'","The tiny dog weighs less than three pounds and is smaller than chihuahua .

"Love triangle: Timothy John 'TJ' Brewer pleaded guilty to two counts of assault and received a two-year suspended sentence . A betrayed husband has been charged after beating his father and hitting his wife in an alcohol-fueled rage after allegedly catching them having sex in his son's bedroom last month. Caught in a bizarre family love triangle, Timothy John 'TJ' Brewer, 33, allegedly found his wife Logan Rae Brewer 'on top of his dad', respected Moab fire chief Wesley 'Corky' Brewer, after they had dinner at TJ's Utah home on July 11. Furious at their love tryst, TJ 'backhanded' his wife and pointed a gun at her, before 'pistol whipping' his father, who later stabbed himself. According to police documents published by TPM, the . trouble started when Logan went upstairs after dinner - during which they . had all been drinking - to put one of her children to bed. Realizing he was alone in the house, TJ, a 12-year veteran of the Moab sheriff's office, went upstairs to find his wife. Deseret News reports Brewer told investigators he found his son's bedroom door locked, got into the room, and 'lost it' when he found his father and wife in bed together. Logan told officers her husband beat his father, then left the bedroom and returned with a handgun he had just loaded. 'She stated TJ hit her, backhanded her, and pointed a handgun at her face,' an officer wrote. 'She believed he was going to shoot her.' Betrayal: Timothy John 'TJ' Brewer, right, beat his father Wesley 'Corky' Brewer (pictured together) after he caught him in bed with his wife Logan . Happier times: TJ Brewer allegedly found his wife Logan Brewer having sex with his father in their son's bed . Logan raced to her parents’ house after the altercation, while Corky returned to his own home to 'find a firearm.' However when his . distressed wife, Cindy Brewer, tried to hide the gun in the car, Corky . allegedly 'grabbed a butcher knife and stabbed himself two . times, puncturing a lung and slicing his liver'. Cindy pulled the kitchen knife out before Corky . was rushed to Moab Regional Hospital. He was too injured to talk to police and eventually had to be flown to a Colorado hospital for surgery. TJ . and Corky were among several law enforcement officers in the extended Brewer . family, which includes multiple police officers and local sheriff’s . deputies. Family: TJ Brewer, pictured with his wife Logan and their children, managed to keep his certification on Wednesday, but only by a single vote . TPM reports the sheriff's deputy went to the hospital to 'kill' his father, and was initially confronted by his uncle, Curt Brewer, who is also a sheriff’s . deputy, in the parking lot. When police arrived, intoxicated TJ was not wearing a shirt or shoes and 'stated several . times that he wanted to kill his dad, that he wanted his gun to ‘finish . the job'.' Police wrote in their report: 'TJ . made numerous remarks to each officer and deputy that arrived, about . all of us being stupid, dumb asses, and at one point stated we needed to . call someone with a brain to come and talk with him.' Deseret News also reported that TJ, who worked in the narcotics unit of the sheriff's office, allegedly hit an officer. Injured: Moab Fire Chief Wesley 'Corky' Brewer stabbed himself twice after the confrontation . According to the Salt Lake Tribune, officers accompanied TJ home so he could check on his children, breaking down on the way saying he had lost everything. TJ was arrested and charged with attempted homicide, aggravated assault, two . counts of domestic violence in front a child, assault on a police . officer, intoxication, and disorderly conduct by Grand County officers. However, because of the Brewers' law enforcement ties in Grand County, the investigation was passed onto the Utah County Sheriff’s Office who reduced the charges to two class A misdemeanors - assault and assault against a . peace officer. The Utah Attorney General is also prosecuting the case rather than the local . district attorney. Violent: Police say TJ Brewer went to Moab Regional Hospital to 'kill' his father, Wesley 'Corky' Brewer . TPM reports TJ was released from the San Juan County Jail on bail on July 15. He . is forbidden from drinking alcohol, contacting his father and wife, and he must be supervised when he visits his children. TJ resigned . from the Grand County Sheriff’s Department and is next due in court on Tuesday. If convicted, he faces up to two years in prison. Corky also resigned from the fire department where he had been . chief since 1989.

"This is the bittersweet moment a loving girlfriend married her terminally-ill husband on his hospital bed. Cola Glenny, 22, said 'I do' to Felix Glenny, 23, as he lay in Medway Maritime Hospital Kent, suffering from incurable bowel cancer. Felix was able to make it out of his bed to celebrate the 'perfect' day afterwards with his new wife, while their two children Ralph, two, and Pearl, four months, looked on. Ceremony: Felix Glenny married Cola Glenny in a ceremony at Medway Maritime Hospital yesterday . He was admitted to hospital in November after suffering for several weeks with what he thought at first were stomach cramps. But after being admitted to hospital on 11 November, doctors found a large tumour in his bowels. Although they were able to remove it, further tests showed that the cancer had spread and Felix had only weeks to live. After finding out last week that the cancer is terminal, Felix and Cola decided to marry as soon as possible, and invited their friends and family to a ceremony conducted by the hospital chaplain yesterday. 'It was perfect': The two were married in a ceremony at Medway Maritime Hospital, where Felix has been since November . Speaking to MailOnline tonight, Cola said: 'After a second operation last Friday they discovered that the cancer had . spread everywhere. That's it now, there’s no stopping it. 'When they told us I had to leave the room – it was too much to take it. 'After it all settled down and we got our heads round it as much as we . could, Felix just said he wanted to get married as soon as we could. We . arranged it for yesterday. 'It was crazy because we were really happy, but it was so emotional. 'It . was a lovely day and we’ve been thinking about it today, saying “It was . perfect and it couldn’t have gone any better”. 'We had talked about getting married even before he was ill - and when we found out the cancer was terminal we wanted to do . it straight away. 'Felix managed to get out of bed and we went over the the social club and . had a ceremony – the Chaplain from the hospital came over and gave us a blessing.' 'It was a really nice day and everyone really helped us out. All of our family was there and a lot of our friends.' Felix, who is also known as Ryan, met through mutual friends in Lower Stoke, Kent, in August 2010. They quickly fell for one another and within a year the couple had moved in together and Cola was pregnant with her first child, Ralph. Cola, a hairdresser, and Felix, who works for a water supply company, lived happily together for two years and had a second child, Pearl, who is now four months old. But only weeks after his second child was born, Felix was struck with awful stomach pains and couldn't make it to work. But when the couple visited the hospital and called doctors, they were repeatedly told that Felix was not seriously ill. Terminal: Felix found out his cancer was fatal last Friday and the couple, parents to two young children, wanted to get married as soon as possible . Their concerns were ignored despite . the fact that three of Felix's family members have recently died of . bowel cancer - his mother and grandfather last year, and his aunt in . 2007. Cola said: 'He was ill . two weeks prior to being taken in to hospital, we kept going up there . and they kept turning us away, saying it was a bug. 'We had three ambulances out. We rang 111 and we told him all his . symptoms, and they sent ambulances. Twice they took us to hospital. 'Once . they said it was a kidney infection, another time they said it was . irritable bowels and one of the other times they didn’t even take us to . the hospital because they said there was nothing wrong with him. 'In . A&E they said it was a sickness bug. I told him he has a family . history of bowel cancer, but they just weren’t interested. He finally . got taken in on the 11 November. Up and about: Felix was able to leave his hospital bed to cut a wedding cake and kiss his bride in front of friends and family . 'Finally we went to a medial centre and we said we’re not going anywhere until we know . what’s wrong with him. 'We’re not being fobbed off again and again – we . basically said to people at the hospital and said we’re not going . anywhere until it’s sorted. 'Then . a surgeon had a feel of his tummy and could feel something in his . bowels, and that’s when they did the CT scan and found it was cancer. 'It . was awful finding out – we’ve got two small children. He’s been in hospital since. In the four weeks since he had his tumour removed the cancer spread quite far.' But despite being struck by such a desperate illness, Felix's thoughts remained with his young family throughout - and how he would provide for them. Cola said: 'He’s quite a family man, he insists he brings the money in. So he went to work two or three times while he was ill, but couldn’t really do much, because he had major stomach cramps which would go and come back . Proud father: Felix before he was hospitalised, holding his son Ralph, left, and baby daughter Pearl . Young love: Felix and Cola met in 2010 and have two children together, Ralph, aged two, and Pearl, four months . 'For the last couple of days before he went to hospital he was just in bed all day and didn’t eat for two weeks. 'Felix’s . best friend Ashley – when he went into hospital he was really . concerned about money, as he has a family and a house to keep up. Big day: Cola Glenny in her wedding dress outside of the hospital . 'That was the only thing he was talking about before his first op, saying he wanted to make money for us. 'Then Ashley started to GoFundMe website, with a little bit about what’s going on. It’s now raised more than £7,000. 'It’s lovely – I’ve had so many people message me saying they’re thinking of me and I don’t even know them. 'Felix is really comfortable at the moment. He’s got his head round everything and just wants to spend time with the kids, me and his family. 'He’s been really really positive, and is trying to think of the . kids. 'He doesn’t want to get upset in front of the kids, he doesn’t want . to let them know what’s going on. 'Especially Ralph, who is starting to . understand that his dad’s in hospital. 'But he’s been really positive, . and since finding out it’s terminally he’s been exceptionally brave. 'The kids and I will be in the hospital on Christmas Day. 'Pearl is too young to know what’s going on, but Ralph sort of understands. When we go to see his dad he says ""poorly"". 'It will be his last Christmas with them, so we want to make it as special as possible.'","Cola Glenny married Felix yesterday in Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent .

"These dramatic scenes show the moment a protester clashed with police in China as they were outnumbered by hoards of officers. Around 1,000 demonstrators marched through the city of Qidong, about an hour north of Shanghai, in the latest in a string of environmental led protests. And clashes erupted after protesters ransacked government buildings, overturned cars and flung documents from offices. Outnumbered: Police swarm around a protestor outside the local government offices in the coastal city of Qidong following demonstrations . Making a stand: A protester stands in front of a lines of riot police officers called in to quell the situation in Qidong . Violent: Police encircle the protestor as he lays on the ground and appear to be beating him . Chinese officials were forced to cancel . an industrial waste pipeline project after the anti-pollution . demonstrators occupied the government office in eastern China, . destroying computers and overturning cars. Sparked by fears of environmental degradation the latest clash highlights the social tensions the government in Beijing faces as it approaches a leadership transition this year. It was also the second cancellation of an industrial project this month, as officials buckle under pressure from protests. Zhang Guohua, city mayor of the eastern China city of Nantong, said in a statement the city would terminate the planned pipeline that would have emptied waste water from a Japanese-owned paper factory via the coastal town of Qidong into the sea. Armed: Police arm themselves in riot gear as they prepare to push back protesters . Wreckage: Protesters overturn a police car as they hit back against officers . Damage: Documents are strewn on the floor and cars are damaged by protesters outside the local government office building . Ransacked: Demonstrators stand inside a destroyed office at the local government building where desks and computers were overturned and smashed . Several protesters entered the city . government's main building and were seen smashing computers, overturning . desks and throwing documents out the windows to loud cheers from the . crowd. A number of cars and a minibus were overturned and destroyed, while at least two police officers were dragged into the crowd at the government office and punched and beaten up. But police were out in numbers, many in riot gear, as they clashed with a number of protestors. Environmental worries have stoked calls for expanded rights for citizens and greater consultation in the tightly controlled one-party state. The outpouring of public anger is emblematic of the rising discontent facing Chinese leaders, who are obsessed with maintaining stability and struggling to balance growth with rising public anger over environmental threats. Trouble: Pockets of clashes continue as police take on protesters head on . Support in numbers: Large numbers of officers guard the local government office building . The protest followed similar demonstrations against projects the Sichuan town of Shifang earlier this month and in the cities of Dalian in the northeast and Haimen in southern Guangdong province in the past year. The leadership has vowed to clean up China's skies and waterways and increasingly tried to appear responsive to complaints about pollution. But environmental disputes pit citizens against local officials whose aim is to lure fresh investment and revenue into their areas.

"They sent a creepy feeling through several Southern California families, but authorities say the person who left porcelain dolls on doorsteps didn't mean any harm. The woman, who hasn't been named, told investigators she was 'embarrassed' by the concern she caused among the families. The Orange County Sheriff's Department said Thursday that someone had left the dolls wearing nightgowns and lace dresses at as many as eight homes in a San Clemente neighborhood this week. Disturbing: This doll was left outside of a home in California where a little girl lives with her family - 10 others have also been found . Mystery: At least 11 porcelain dolls were left outside homes in this gated California community . The families were worried because they . felt each doll resembled a young girl who lived in the house, setting . off an investigation and call for public help in finding who had placed . them. 'Because her intentions were good, she . felt embarrassed at the fear she instilled in the community,' Orange . County Sheriff's Lieutenant Jeff Hallock told the Los Angeles Times. 'She just thought she was being nice.' The woman had deliberately matched up the dolls with the girls, thinking they would appreciate the gesture. As . many as 11 California families from the gated residential community in . San Clemente, Orange County, came forward to report finding the dolls on their doorsteps. The dolls began appearing on doorsteps on July 16. All the girls who received one were aged around 10 years old, and some attend the same elementary school. 'Families in each of the homes where porcelain dolls were left voiced concern that the dolls resembled their daughters,' the Sheriff’s Department stated in a news release. Photographs of two of the dolls provided by police show one curly-headed and dressed in a pink nightie with bunny slippers, and the other in a ruffled blue dress. After finding the person responsible, the police said the dolls had been left outside the homes as a 'gesture of goodwill'. Bizarre: Police don't know if the dolls are meant as gifts or indicate something more concerning . The dolls are currently being stored in the police department's evidence room. Families who received one of the dolls helped solve the mystery, after realizing that many of them attended the same church. Police contacted a woman who was part of their church, and who the families said may have been behind the gesture. According to the OC Register, the woman admitted she had left the dolls outside the houses, and told police she had just been trying to get rid of her collection. Investigation: Police were called by concerned families after dolls resembling their children were left outside houses . Orange County Sheriff’s Department Lieutenant Jeff Hallock said the police became involved because the case appeared to involve children. 'Obviously, there’s an indication by some the parents that the dolls resemble their daughters. We’re talking about children here. Anything that has the potential to involve children causes us some concern,' he told KTLA. The dolls were first reported on Tuesday and were taken as evidence by police.","Police were called in after 11 dolls were left on doorsteps in San Clemente .

"When you're yearly take-home is $36.6 million, you can afford to tailor your life accordingly.

"At first glance these pictures show depressingly familiar scenes of fields of poppies in the wilds of strife-hit Afghanistan - soon to be processed into heroin and shipped around the world. But these scenes were actually captured at an 88 acre farm near Winchester in Hampshire. The flowers are identical to those grown in Afghanistan but, instead of funding global crime syndicates, they will be used to treat those in desperate pain. The UK crop covers an estimated 6,300 acres on farms across the nation and will be harvested by a pharmaceutical company to produce pain-relieving drugs, such as codeine and morphine. Poppy painkiller: These crops were photographed in a secret location in Hampshire. They are harvested for their strong narcotic qualities as painkillers . This spectacular field will flower, then the crop will be left to die off and dry out before it is harvested with special machinery . Morphine has traditionally been imported to the West from Tasmania, Spain and Turkey, but now an increasing number of lilac poppies are grown in the UK to reduce costs. The morphine poppy, Papaver somniferum, was first grown commercially on British farms in 2002 and now it can be seen around Dorset, Lincolnshire, Oxfordshire and Hampshire. This spectacular field will flower, then the crop will be left to die off and dry out before it is harvested with special machinery. The medicinal properties of opium have been known from ancient times, and it was used as a narcotic in European cultures as early as 4,000BC . Seeds of destruction: Afghan anti-narcotics personnel destroy poppies in the district of Shindand, Afghanistan . Once the poppies have dried the seed capsule and top two inches of stem will be removed. The seed will then be cleaned for the culinary markets, as poppy seed contains no morphine and the rest will be milled, pelletised and shipped to a special plant for extraction. The morphine is found in the structure of the seed capsule and the top two inches of the stem. Medicinal poppies are a different species to the common wild red poppy which contains no morphine. They have a white and lilac colouring and the Latin name means the 'sleep-bringing poppy', which is a reference to its narcotic properties. Morphine is a medicine which is used in relieving severe pain, especially after operations. Its effects will last for a long time after you have taken it. It works by affecting chemicals in the brain and nervous system which are involved in the sensation of pain.

"This brave group of Aussie veterinary students bar-ed all in a desperate bid to raise cash to pay for their graduation ball. The students at James Cook University in Queensland bravely shed all their clothes for the two shoots which took place on a farm and in their vet school classrooms. Organiser Angela Davey, 24, told Daily Mail Australia there were a couple of awkward moments during the shoots- when a couple of unsuspecting security guards stumbled upon their shoot in the university and a farmer who nearly crashed his tractor into a fence. The group of students from James Cook University in Queensland shed all their clothes for the shoot . Ten per cent of proceeds from the calender are going to the Black River and District Rural Fire Brigade . Animals snapped in the shoot included horses, dogs, bison, baby guinea pigs, a macaw and a blue-tongued lizard. The calender is called Vets Uncovered and Townsville photographer Vicki Miller had the honour of snapping the vets being at one with nature. Angela, who is from Darwin but studying in Townsville, said: 'When we first started to think about fundraising ideas for our graduation ball, I suggested a nude calendar as a bit of a joke. Animals in the shoot included horses, dogs, bison, baby guinea pigs, a macaw and a blue-tongued lizard. Farmer fun: The vets got up close and personal with the pigs on the farm . The students bear-ed all for the unique shoot for their fundraising calender . 'A couple of other students jumped on board, and we started to look into it a bit more seriously. When we found that it was a legitimate option, we presented the idea to the class. 'We took inspiration from a vet from Massey University in New Zealand which has a tradition of publishing Barely There nude calenders. 'We told the class how much money we could potentially make and I think that was when everyone realised that it was actually a serious fundraising venture and not a joke.' Chilling out: One of the students relaxes with a dog and a hungry horse . The calender is expected to raise $44,000 and they hope to sell 2000 copies. The group of 38 students had two different photo shoots for the calender- one at Ms Miller's property 100km south west of Townsville and a second in Townsville at the Vet School and Turf Club. Andrea said the group was not ready for what they were going to encounter on their first shoot. The group got the chance to feel at one with nature on the shoot on the farm outside Townsville . She said: 'I think we all had this idea in our heads that we would probably be able to wear underwear for most of the photos, and strategically place animals and objects in front of us to make it look like we were naked. 'We were all thrown a little out of our comfort zones when, for the very first photo, Vicki instructed the students to take everything off, and go stand in the yard with a bunch of cattle. 'After that, we just had to deal with the fact that we were totally naked with our classmates. Two security guards stumbled upon the group when they were carrying out a naked study session . 'Thankfully, our class is full of amazing people, and everyone was so supportive of one another. It didn't take long before we were all quite comfortable with it, and we had a lot of fun.' The class will be donating 10 per cent of what we raise to the Black River and District Rural Fire Brigade, for the development of their Townsville Region Training Facility. The much anticipated ball will be held at the end of 2015 and the location is yet to be decided.

"Three top retailers have been criticised by mental health charities for selling fancy dress costumes that appeared to trivialise mental health issues. Supermarket giant Asda has announced it will make a £25,000 donation to the mental health charity Mind after it apologised for advertising an outfit comprised of a ragged, blood-spattered straitjacket - and pictured worn by someone covered in blood and brandishing a machete - as a 'mental patient fancy dress costume'. Tesco said shortly after that it would be removing the 'Psycho Ward' costumes advertised on it own sites - a bright orange jumpsuit with the word 'Committed' on the back. Stigma: Asda's 'mental patient costume' (left) and Tesco's 'Psycho Ward' costume enhanced negative stereotypes of mentally ill people, charities said . A number of traders on Amazon are also selling a range of ""psycho"" costumes for both adults and children, but the online retailer has yet to comment. One, listed as a 'psycho costume', consists of a white shirt covered in 'blood', while another child's 'psycho surgeon' set shows a shirt and trouser set smeared with red paint. Tesco said it was 'really sorry for any offence caused' by the costume, which was worn on its website by a model in a brown mask, holding a syringe. The website description of the costume says: 'Dress up as the most thrilling psycho killer character of all time in this Psycho Ward costume, consisting of a bright orange, long-sleeved boiler suit with zip fastener to front, 'Psycho Ward' printed on the chest. 'The same words (are) printed on the back in larger letters with a prominent 'Committed' stamp just below.' Inappropriate: Amazon.com also advertised a Psycho Ward costume - at a reduced price . Asda's 'mental patient' costume, . which first provoked the storm, was designed to look like a . blood-splattered straitjacket with ragged edges. It was on sale for £20 through the supermarket's clothing arm George. Many . took to Twitter to express their disgust at the description including . former footballer Stan Collymore, who has a well-documented battle with . depression. He tweeted: 'Dear ASDA, nice stereotype of ' Mental patients'. Something you'd expect from the £££. A f***ing joke. 'Do you actually realise how many . people are hanging themselves because of being frightened of the stigma? Wording is CLEAR. MENTAL PATIENT.' Asda yesterday apologised for the incident in a series of tweets, and announced the large donation it had made today. A spokesman for Asda declined to . elaborate further on the donation, other than to say: 'This is a sincere . gesture to apologise for the offence. We want to do this for the right . reasons and not for publicity.' The . company said: 'We're deeply sorry one of our fancy dress costumes has . upset people. This was an unacceptable error - the product was withdrawn . immediately. Bad taste: Supermarket giant Asda has been forced to apologise after it advertised a fancy dress outfit featuring someone covered in blood and brandishing a machete as a 'mental patient fancy dress costume' 'We'd like to offer our sincere apologies for the offence it's caused and will be making a sizeable donation to @MindCharity. 'We removed the product from our website this afternoon but unfortunately the page may remain visible for a few more hours.' A Tesco spokesman said: 'We're really sorry for any offence this has caused and we are removing this product from sale.' A spokesman said the 'Psycho Ward' costume was intended to refer . to a 'film character' and that after complaints from customers it had . been withdrawn from sale and from the company's website. Former . spin doctor Alistair Campbell, who has also suffered from depression, told BBC London 94.9: 'It underlines to me that we treat mental illness like it's not serious. I've had depression, I've had psychosis. Mental illness is scarier than . most physical illnesses and I just cannot understand what goes through . the minds of intelligent business people. 'We are trying to change attitudes towards mental illness... but we are still in the . dark ages if some of the biggest companies in this country - Tesco, . Asda, Amazon - think that it's acceptable to sell something like this. It's unacceptable on every level.' Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of . mental health charity SANE, said: 'We welcome Asda's withdrawal of the . costume, which could only serve to reinforce prejudice and . misperceptions of mental illness, leaving those already struggling with . mental health problems more lonely and excluded.' Outrage: Many took to Twitter to express their disgust at the description including former footballer Stan Collymore, who has a well-documented battle with depression . Stunned: Former Labour spin doctor and mental health charity Rethink were among the critics on Twitter . Paul Jenkins, chief executive of the . charity Rethink Mental Illness, said: 'I am pleased to see Asda has now . removed the costume from their website, but the fact it was ever there . in the first place is completely unacceptable. Sue Baker, campaigner for mental . health charity Mind, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Nine out of . ten people using mental health services in patient care report stigma . and discrimination from a range of sources. 'Stigma and discrimination is . unfortunately still really damaging in England today and this kind of . myth of the dangerousness posed by people, that you should be scared of . anyone who has used mental health services, is really damaging. '(Asda) certainly crossed the line . here and I hear it might well have been changed with the addition of . mental patient, so it was definitely being used to tap into negative . stereotypes.' 'This costume is breathtakingly . insensitive, and it's shocking that Asda ever felt it was an appropriate . product to sell. There is already so much stigma surrounding mental . illness, and 'joke' products like this only serve to make things worse.' Lucie Russell, director of campaigns . at the charity YoungMinds, said: 'Asda has made a huge error of judgment . in marketing this costume as . 'mental health patient'. This costume just makes it harder for children . and young people to speak out and get help about mental health. 'One in  ten children and young people have a diagnosable mental health . problem, with many more out there struggling without being diagnosed. We . need to create a climate of support around children and young people, . not fear.' Mistake: Asda has now withdrawn the product after apologising for an 'unacceptable error' The row comes as new figures show that more than 30,000 people with mental health problems are dying needlessly every year from causes other than suicide. The Government estimates around 100,000 people under 75 die every year from illnesses that could have been prevented through better medical treatment or interventions like stop smoking campaigns. A new report from the charity Rethink Mental Illness has found around a third of these deaths are among people with mental health problems. They are more likely to die from preventable illness - such as cancer or heart disease - than the rest of the population. The study, Lethal Discrimination, calls on the Government to do more to target this group, who have higher rates of illness through side-effects of medication, smoking, a lack of basic health checks on the NHS and professionals not taking their concerns seriously.","Asda 'mental patient' fancy dress costume was on sale for £20 .

"There was a social media meltdown last week when Mick Jagger was snapped with a brunette looking presumably post-sex-cosy on the balcony of his hotel room in Zurich last week. It's been a mere eleven weeks since the death of his long-term girlfriend L'Wren - a shockingly short period of mourning for a woman he spent 13 years with, according to most of the posts and comments. Which begs the question: how long is the official mourning period supposed to be? What is the acceptable length of time someone like Mick is supposed to wait before being linked to anyone else? Mick Jagger's long term girlfriend, L'Wren Scott committed suicide in March earlier this year . A quick survey of around a dozen friends settled on ‘at least a year' - with the view that the longer the relationship, the longer the person should take to get over losing them. But is there really a ‘one size fits all' model for grieving? Particularly for someone struggling with desperately tragic and traumatic emotions triggered by a partner's suicide? I've seen people who I know loved their partner passionately, react very differently after losing them to either death or divorce. Some dealt with death in a matter or fact fashion and got on with the task of rebuilding their lives quickly. Others never did recover, choosing instead to exist in a voluntary time warp, remaining faithful to their past, absent partners forever by reliving their memories on a mental conveyor belt, put on a never-ending loop. How we cope is dependent on our moral code, upbringing, personality, life experience, religion, maturity and a thousand other individual factors. Tracey says that sex can be a way of coping when dealing with grief . Some people deal with loss by disappearing under the duvet for months. Others drink their way through it or bury themselves in work. A friend of mine ran her way back to sanity after her partner died unexpectedly. It made perfect sense to her: she wanted to run from what had happened, so she did. Another locked himself away for eight months with endless box sets and basically distracted his brain until he could face the horror of what happened. We all have different coping mechanisms. Mick has been notoriously unfaithful in the past. I'm not sure what we expected of him but it was fairly predictable that he'd try to make himself feel better by sleeping with someone. Sex is a coping mechanism for sex addicts: just as alcoholics fall off the wagon during a crisis, sex addicts fall into bed with strangers. Add to this that men and women tend to deal with the death of a relationship differently. Women like to make sense of what's happened before moving onto the next. A lot of men don't ever analyse their relationships or life circumstances and remain action focused. If they find themselves single, for whatever reason, their solution is simply to find another partner - so that's what they do. There is also another very human, primitive reason for seeking sex after a tragic loss: it provides comfort, albeit temporary. Mick's actions might not be terribly sensible, popular or mannerly but it's not uncommon to crave sex - the act of which creates life - when confronted with death.

"A couple who raised two deadly cheetahs in their home, are now teaching the pair to hunt so that they can be released back into the wild - by playing football with them. Kim and Hein Schoeman, who took the cubs into their South African home a year ago, are using a plastic ball to train the cheetahs and bizarrely their mad method appears to be working. The pair, both 29, first started caring for the wild cats when a cheetah at the Garden Route Game Lodge gave birth to four cubs. Scroll down for video . Fetch: A couple who raised two deadly cheetahs in their home, are now teaching the pair to hunt so that they can be released back into the wild - by playing football with them .

Start of relationship: The pair, both 29, first started caring for the wild cats when a cheetah at the Garden Route Game Lodge, gave birth to four cubs . The mother was only able to provide for half of her litter so the duo stepped in and have been raising the cubs ever since, alongside their children, Malan and Kayla, who were then just two years and three months old. Twelve months on, the extraordinary couple are now using some unusual methods to teach the deadly cheetahs to hunt for themselves before they are reintroduced into the wild in about 18 months. The husband and wife team started with the basics by encouraging the cheetahs to chase a football, first around their garden and then down a hill at the reserve. Joint effort: The husband and wife team started with the basics by encouraging the cheetahs to chase a football, first around their garden and then down a hill at the reserve . Game plan: Hein said 'We started off by developing the skills of chasing, catching and holding, those three movements are probably the most important' Kim and Hein then progressed onto simulating ambushes, with Kim moving towards a group of springbok, while Hein hides with the two cats, waiting for the perfect opportunity to attack. Hein believes that playing football with the cheetahs helps them learn the fundamental techniques needed to become a successful hunter. Hein said: 'We started off by developing the skills of chasing, catching and holding, those three movements are probably the most important. 'Regardless of their speed, without having the ability to catch and hold their prey, their hunt would be for nothing.

Taking a break: Having almost mastered the basics, the couple are now trying to teach the cheetahs the mental requirements for hunting such as patience and limitations . On the prowl: Hein believes that playing football with the cheetahs helps them learn the fundamental techniques needed to become a successful hunter . 'By hunting quickly, and more importantly, efficiently, cheetahs make hunting seem like an easy task.' Having almost mastered the basics, the couple are now trying to teach the cheetahs the mental requirements for hunting such as patience and limitations. Kim said: 'They see something and they think that if they start to run they'll catch it, which is not the case at all. They'll never catch it. 'So they need to know that they've got as close as possible before they start running. 'It takes a while for them to learn what their limitations are and exactly what they're looking at. 'Wild cheetahs don't take chances because they know that their strength lies in their speed rather than their physical strength. 'Their mother, when she was younger, was hunting things twice her size. She is as good as it gets so they've inherited some good traits.' At two and a half years old the cheetahs will be fully grown (twice their current size) and it is hoped they will have developed enough successful hunting skills to be released. Despite their ability to accelerate up to speeds of 120 kilometres per hour in short spurts, cheetahs are ambush predators, they trick their prey rather than chase them in a straight line.

"The young red fox had got itself in a bit of a jam. There was only one thing for it - the notoriously shy creature was going to have to ask humans for help. It clearly couldn't resist having a look at a discarded glass jar and ended up with its head stuck inside. In this short but sweet footage, the fox is spotted by two men on a Russian dirt road. Scroll down for video . As two men walked along a Russian dirt road, they noticed a fox with its head trapped in a jar ahead . Instead of running away from humans, the wild fox ran towards the men, knowing they might be able to help . Instead of running away, like a wild fox normally would, the trapped fox scurried up to the men. One of the men reached down to grab the jar, which made the creature wriggle to try to escape. But the fox quickly realised that tactic wouldn't work and stood still for its rescuer. The man, who appeared to be wearing camouflage army gear, grabbed the fox by the scruff of its neck and pulled the jar away with his other hand. At first the young fox wriggled as one of the men tried to pull the jar away . The fox quickly realised it needed to stand still while the man took it by the scruff of its neck and gently tugged the jar away . In a flash, the fox made the most of its freedom and ran away. The man joked in Russian: 'Where is the thank you?' according to 9 MSN. He then said: 'Thank you' in a higher-pitched voice, pretending to be their bushy-tailed friend.

"'Politicised': Former RSPCA chief Gavin Grant, pictured . Donations to the RSPCA have dropped by more than £7million after the charity was accused of betraying its traditional core support for contentious political issues. The backlash follows a controversial period for the RSPCA, which has been pursuing campaigns against hunting, the badger cull  and the Grand National. It has also been accused of bullying tactics in bringing prosecutions for animal cruelty. And there has been a power vacuum at the top of the organisation since Gavin Grant, the chief executive who presided over the charity’s new direction, unexpectedly left  his post in February due to ill health. His deputy, John Grounds, left six weeks later. Critics of the RSPCA’s decision to campaign on politicised issues say the drop in donations indicates  that it needs to refocus on traditional concerns. Latest accounts show the charity is in financial crisis and losing support from the public and grassroots members. Accounts posted  on the RSPCA website show a fall in cash from voluntary income, with receipts down from £112.4 million to £105.4 million. Cash from legacies was down £5.7 million, while individual gifts fell by £1.2 million. At the same time, membership fees fell by £34,000, or six per cent, from £590,000 to £556,000. The charity’s overall operating income also slumped by more than £11 million, from £132.8 million to £121.2 million. This was due to rising costs for fuel, veterinary fees and private boarding costs incurred where there was no room at its centres to care for animals. In a statement last week, RSPCA council chairman Mike Tomlinson said the figures were ‘clearly unsustainable and show things cannot continue to carry on as they are’. He told staff the charity needed to save £4.5 million and jobs would be cut from the 1,568 workforce. Although the new plans have not yet been finalised, the charity intends to focus on animal rescue work. It is also planning new money-making ventures so it does not have to rely on individuals leaving donations in their wills. How the Mail On Sunday reported the Heythrop Hunt case in 2012 . But it is not yet  clear if the organisation intends to cut back on controversial prosecutions, such as its decision to bring a £326,000 private case against the Heythrop Hunt in Oxfordshire in December 2012. Although the case was successful, the judge suggested the public might feel the cash spent ‘can be more usefully employed’. Sir Barney White-Spunner, of the Countryside Alliance, said: ‘The RSPCA has undertaken high-profile, political campaigns on subjects such as hunting, the badger cull, live exports and horse-racing – campaigns we feel have done little to further animal welfare and should not be the priority of the RSPCA.  We hope it will reconsider how it spends donors’ money.’ An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘We have seen periods where we are cash-rich, and leaner times when people tighten their belts. But  we are prepared to make difficult decisions.’","Donations to the RSPCA drop by more than £7million after accusations of betraying core support .

"A California schoolteacher was arrested Wednesday after authorities clued in by an horrific odor found hundreds of living and dead pythons in plastic bins stacked floor to ceiling inside his home in suburban Orange County. William Buchman, 53, was taken in on what will likely be animal cruelty charges after neighbors called to complain of the stench they called 'God-awful' and 'the smell of death.' Investigators wearing respirator masks carried out 182 live and 240 dead ball pythons that could have been worth a startling $100K had they not been infested with mites, starving or worse. Scroll down for video . Stench: Authorities responding to complaints of 'the smell of death' coming from an Orange County home found a collection of over 400 dead, living, and barely living ball pythons . William Buchman, 53, was arrested for neglect of animals after police found at least 350 pythons in his home . 'The smell alone... I feel like I need . to take a shower for a week,' said police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna. 'They're pretty much in all the bedrooms. Everywhere.' Amongst the bedraggled snakes, officers found dozens of mice and rats cannibalizing each other in their cages after neighbors complained about the smell. 'We have rats that are dead in the cages with the live rats,' said Sondra Berg of Santa Ana Police Animal Services. 'They've actually become cannibal and eat each other.' Buchman was still in custody Wednesday afternoon, Bertagna said. The Newport-Mesa Unified School District, where he works, declined comment, saying it was a police matter. Infested: Police found 182 living snakes and 240 dead ones ranging from newly dead to bare skeletons. Here, veterinarians at an area pet hospital attend to the living ones, which were found rife with parasites and dehydrate . Cramped: The snakes could have once been worth upwards of $100,000. Here, the plastic boxes that were piled floor to ceiling in the teacher's home can be seen following his arrest . 'God-awful': Authorities wore respirators as they removed the creatures because the stench was so overwhelming . Progressive obsession? Experts said many of the snakes were of breeding age. Authorities had actually visited the home one year ago, but found the mostly juvenile snakes to be well maintained at the time . Well liked: One parent at Buchman's Newport Beach school said the 53-year-old is an excellent teacher and that she would even testify on his behalf if she was called to . Buchman has not yet had a court appearance or been formally charged and it wasn't clear if he had an attorney. Authorities . said he lived alone, and neighbors said his mother, who had lived with . him, had passed away within the past few years. 'His mother was a strong presence in his life,' Shelly Rooney, a parent of a child at Buchman's school, told NBCLA. Rooney said that Buchman once broke down in tears as he discussed his late mother with her. Despite that awkward encounter, and even after learning of Buchman's unsavory hobby, Rooney said she still supports the teacher. 'Mr. Buchman has always been a caring teacher,' said the Newport Beach mom, 'and one who I would gladly be a character witness if called to do so.' Berg said four of the five bedrooms in the home were stacked from floor to ceiling and wall to wall with plastic bins on wooden and metal racks. The bins were packed so tightly, Berg said, that they didn't require lids because there was no room for the snakes to slither out. Each snake was cataloged by name and . type, and Berg said Buchman told authorities he was involved in a . snake-breeding enterprise. Loads of trash is shown stacked against the home of William Buchman on Wednesday . Plastic bins filled with snakes were stacked one on top of the other and some of the snakes had been dead for months and months . 'House of Horrors: That's the best way to describe it,' Berg said of the house. 'I mean there's so many dead snakes ... ranging from dead for months to just dead. There's an infestation of rats and mice all over the house. There are rats and mice in plastic storage tubs that are actually cannibalizing each other.' Some of the snakes were little more than skeletons. Others, only recently dead, were covered with flies and maggots. Next-door neighbor Forest Long Sr. said he has known Buchman for years, adding the men had once been friendly, getting together to watch sports on television. But he noticed a change in his neighbor about a year ago, he said, adding Buchman stopped coming around and, when he did, he appeared to have gained a good deal of weight. 'Something changed in Bill, yes it did,' he said.'Something triggered it because I couldn't even think that that was going on.' Santa Ana Police Officer Sondra Berg holds a python on Wednesday following his arrest . Buchman told authorities he was involved in a type of snake breeding called 'morphing,' in which owners try to breed different color patterns in the reptiles . The odor from the house, meanwhile, became unbearable about five months ago. 'It got so bad as to where my wife would throw up,' Long said. 'She'd get out of the car and run into the house.' He said neighbors speculated that there must be a dead body inside. Bertagna said animal control authorities had tried to work with Buchman for several months after neighbors reported the smell. He said they sought a warrant after they were not allowed inside the home. Berg said Buchman told authorities he was involved in a type of snake breeding called 'morphing,' in which owners try to breed different color patterns in the reptiles. It was a very popular and lucrative enterprise 10 years ago, but has declined, she said. 'There was a lot of fast money in it, but now the bottom pretty much fell out of the market because there are so many of these snakes out there,'she said. At one time, Berg said, a good specimen of the type authorities found could have fetched $5,000. Today it would be worth only about $200.

"A pet cat was temporarily paralysed and left with eight stitches after a microchip was accidentally injected into its spine, its owner revealed today. Kristina Hogan, 31, of Consett, County Durham, was ‘devastated’ after handlers injected the chip between the first and second vertebrae of three-year-old Sassie’s neck at a free council event. Now, the single mother - whose three children were left in tears by the accident - is coming to terms with her pet being confined to a cage for six weeks, having had eight stitches along her back. Eight stitches: Handlers injected the microchip between the first and second vertebrae of Sassie's neck . Saddened: Kristina Hogan, 31, of Consett, County Durham, was 'devastated' after the accident . Miss Hogan said: ‘The girl doing the chipping seemed not to have a clue what she was doing. She made two attempts to chip Sassie. ‘On the second, she rammed the needle so hard into her she injected the chip between the first and second vertebrae in the neck, paralysing her. ‘If it had gone any further up it would have hit her in the brain, and if it had gone any deeper it would have perforated her spinal cord.’ The chip was inserted by a non-vet worker at a free microchipping session run by the council. Miss Hogan, who lives on a road with an average house value of £66,000 and is mother to Fatith, six, Katelyn, eight, and Nicholas, 12, took Sassie to Crofts vets in Cramlington. Painful: Sassie has been confined to a cage for six weeks, having had eight stitches along her back . X-ray photo: Durham County Council has agreed to pay the £3,000 cost of the surgery required for Sassie . There, she had scans and surgery to remove the chip. Durham County Council has agreed to pay the £3,000 cost of the surgery and Miss Hogan said she is happy with their response. 'The kids were in tears. They can’t go and give her a cuddle and pick her up because they’re so worried they’re going to hurt her spine' Kristina Hogan . But she added: ‘She [Sassie] just used to really enjoy being out - if you opened the door to call her she wouldn’t come and nine times out of 10 you’d have to tempt her in with a bit of ham. ‘Now she’ll never be able to go outside again because she’s too slow to get away from any predators. We won’t know the full extent until she has her cone taken off and her stitches out. ‘It’s affected the children as well - the kids were in tears. They can’t go and give her a cuddle and pick her up because they’re so worried they’re going to hurt her spine.’ The cat was not permanently paralysed, although it may be permanently disabled. Immediately after the microchipping it kept freezing up and losing all movement but it is reportedly feeling better now. Medical assistance: Sassie had scans and surgery to remove the chip at Crofts vets in Cramlington . Fears: Miss Hogan said Sassie cannot 'go outside again because she's too slow to get away from predators' Ian Hoult, neighbourhood protection manager at Durham County Council, said: ‘We are extremely upset and sorry that this has happened. 'We are extremely upset and sorry that this has happened' Ian Hoult, Durham County Council . ‘We immediately apologised and have paid for all necessary veterinary care to ensure the animal’s future well-being. 'It is clearly very distressing for all involved and we would like to take this opportunity once again to say sorry.’ The Cats Protection charity says a microchipping procedure normally costs between £20 and £30 - and should be performed by vets, local authorities and trained members of animal welfare groups. The charity adds that the microchips are slightly smaller than a grain of rice - and should be inserted ‘under the cat's skin between the shoulder blades’. The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons recommends that ‘appropriately trained non-veterinarians’ can perform a microchipping, and there are training courses available.","Mother-of-three Kristina Hogan, 31, of County Durham, was 'devastated'

"A Philadelphia couple who believed in faith-healing were sentenced on Wednesday to three and a half to seven years in prison for the death of a second child who never saw a doctor despite being stricken with pneumonia. Herbert, 45, and Catherine Schaible, 44, defied a court order to get medical care for their children after their two-year-old son, Kent, died in 2009. Instead, they tried to comfort and pray over eight-month-old Brandon last year as he, too, died of treatable pneumonia. Tragic: Herbert, 45, and Catherine Schaible, 44, defied a court order to get medical care for their children after their two-year-old son, Kent, died in 2009. They tried to comfort and pray over eight-month-old Brandon last year as he, too, died of treatable pneumonia. Today they were sentenced to prison time . 'My religious beliefs are that you . should pray, and not have to use medicine. But because it is against the . law, then whatever sentence you give me, I will accept,' Catherine . Schaible told the judge. She added that her beliefs have since changed. The . Schaibles are third-generation members of an insular Pentecostal . community, the First Century Gospel Church in northeast Philadelphia, . where they also taught at the church school. They have seven surviving children. Judge . Benjamin Lerner rejected defense claims that their religious beliefs . 'clashed' with the 2011 court order to get annual checkups and call a . doctor if a child became ill. The . order came after a jury convicted them of involuntary manslaughter in . Kent's death, and they were sentenced to 10 years of probation. Sentenced: Catherine Schaible walks from the criminal justice center in Philadelphia on Wednesday. Along with husband Herbert she was given 3.5 to seven years in prison in the death of a second child who was sick but didn't see a doctor . 'April of 2013 wasn't Brandon's time to die,' Lerner said, noting the violence committed throughout human history in the name of religion. 'You've killed two of your children. ... Not God. Not your church. Not religious devotion. You.' Experts say about a dozen U.S. children die in faith-healing cases each year. The Schaibles are the rare couple to lose a second child that way. Their pastor, Nelson Clark, blamed Kent's death on a 'spiritual lack' in the parents' lives, and insisted they would never seek medical care, even if another child was dying. 'It was so foreseeable to me that this was going to happen,' said Assistant District Attorney Joanne Pescatore, who prosecuted both cases. 'Everybody in the system failed these children.' After the first death, she and public defender Mythri Jayaraman agreed that the couple's beliefs were so ingrained that their children remained at risk. They asked the earlier judge to have the family supervised by a Department of Human Services caseworker. Worship: The Schaibles are third-generation members of an insular Pentecostal community, the First Century Gospel Church in northeast Philadelphia, where they also taught at the church school . Instead, the judge assigned them to probation officers, who are not trained to monitor children's welfare. Pescatore has called Brandon's symptoms 'eerily similar' to Kent's. They included labored breathing and a refusal to eat. In his police statement last year, Herbert Schaible said, 'We believe in divine healing, that Jesus shed blood for our healing and that he died on the cross to break the devil's power.' The Schaibles pleaded no contest to third-degree murder in Brandon's death, and faced a maximum 20- to 40-year term. Pescatore asked for eight to 16 years, while Jayaraman sought less than two years for Catherine Schaible. 'I didn't know what to do when Brandon was sick, because it was much quicker,' said Catherine Schaible, who said he died within a few days. 'The D.A. is actually right. I feel like I failed as a mother because they're not alive.' Herbert Schaible has already served about a year, while his wife has been free on bail. Exit: Catherine Schaible leaves the criminal justice center on Wednesday. The Schaibles pleaded no contest to third-degree murder in Brandon's death, and faced a maximum 20- to 40-year term . A videotape played in court showed . her on a weekly supervised visit, when she brought her children their . favorite meals, along with games and birthday treats. Six . of them are now in foster care, some with relatives. They attend public . schools for the first time, and are getting medical, dental and vision . care. Several now wear glasses. The oldest child, who is 18, sat in court with his grandparents, the family pastor and other supporters. They listened as Herbert Schaible's lawyer called the patriarch 'a good man, a righteous man, a spiritual man.' 'He's still grieving the loss of his two sons,' lawyer Bobby Hoof said.","Herbert, 45, and Catherine Schaible, 44, .

"Fifteen airlines have been warned about the risk of ice forming on Boeing's new 747-8 and 787 Dreamliner planes during high-level thunderstorms. Japan Airlines has pulled 787s from two international routes amid concerns about the issue, which could affect engines made by General Electric (GE). It is the latest in a spate of mishaps for the 787, which has previously experienced issues with power supply, brakes, oil and fan shaft, as well as plane fires. Warning: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is set to tell airlines to avoid flying new Boeing Dreamliners near thunderstorms after some planes experience an ice build-up on the engine including Japan Airlines . The entire fleet was grounded earlier this year thanks to repeated faults in the planes' lithium-ion batteries. The latest issue only affects the Boeing 747-8 series - powered by GE's GEnx engines - and the new 787 Dreamliner, which is powered either by GE's engines or Rolls-Royce's Trent 1000. July 28 2012: A fan shaft fails during runway tests in South Carolina . December 2012: A Dreamliner was forced to make an emergency landing in New Orleans . January 7 2013: An unoccupied Dreamliner flight bursts into flames at Boston airport . January 15 2013: . A flight made an emergency landing in Japan after a smoke alarm went . off. The string of incidents led to regulators ordering a global . grounding of the entire Dreamliner fleet, which lasted for four months . June 2 2013: Battery-related problems were reported on a Japan Airlines aircraft forcing the airline to use an alternative plane . June 12 2013: A flight in Japan was cancelled after one of the engines failed to start . June 18 2013: A United Airlines flight was diverted to Seattle due to an oil-filter problem . June 24 2013: A Dreamliner operated by United Airlines had to make an emergency landing in Denver due to a brake problem . July 3 2013: Polish airline LOT cancelled a Dreamliner flight to Chicago because the aircraft had ‘problems with the power supply' July 12 2013: Ethiopian Airlines plane catches fire on the runway at Heathrow, forcing the closure of the whole airport . July 18 2013: . Japan Airlines plane bound for Tokyo had to return to Boston's Logan . airport after take-off because of a possible issue with the fuel pumps . November 2013: Japan Airlines pulls 787s from two international routes amid concerns about ice forming on the planes . Other airlines to have been warned about the icing problem include Lufthansa, United Airlines, an arm of United Continental Holdings and Cathay Pacific Airlines. They have been prohibited from flying the affected aircraft at high altitude within 50 nautical miles of thunderstorms that may contain ice crystals. A Boeing spokesman said: 'Boeing and JAL share a commitment to the safety of passengers and crews on board our airplanes. 'We respect JAL's decision to suspend some 787 service on specific routes.' The warning comes after six planes powered by GE's GEnx - five 747-8s and one 787 - suffered temporary loss of thrust while flying at high altitude from April to November this year. The problem was caused by a build-up of ice crystals - intially just behind the front fan - which spread through the engine. However, all of the aircraft landed at their planned destinations safely. Today, Japan Airlines said it will replace Dreamliners on its Tokyo-Delhi and Tokyo-Singapore flights with other types of aircraft, while also dropping a plan to use 787s for its Tokyo-Sydney route from December. It will continue to fly 787s for other international and domestic routes, which are considered unlikely to be affected by cumulonimbus cloud for the time being. A GE spokesman said: 'The aviation industry is experiencing a growing number of ice-crystal icing encounters in recent years as the population of large commercial airliners has grown, particularly in tropical regions of the world. He added that GE and Boeing are attempting to modify the engine control system software in a bid to eliminate the problem. The 787 - the first passenger jet built mainly from lightweight carbon-composites.- incorporates a raft of changes in the . way passenger jets are designed, including greater use of electrical . systems that save weight compared with older hydraulics. It has suffered a spate of disasters since it was introduced to commercial airlines in 2011. In July, a 787 jet operated by Ethiopian Airlines caught fire on the runway at Heathrow - forcing the closure of the entire airport. Disaster: Earlier this year, a parked Ethiopian Boeing 787 Dreamliner caught fire at Heathrow airport . Closure: The fire kept the airport shut for 90 minutes and was caused by a fault in the lithium battery powering the plane's emergency beacon . A month earlier, Japan had been forced to cancel a 787 flight and use an alternative plane for another due to battery-related problems and engine failure. And in January this year, an unoccupied Dreamliner burst into flames at Boston airport. However, despite its numerous issues, the 787 plane is still considered one of the . most impressive and advanced aircraft in the industry.","Airlines told to avoid high-level thunderstorms that may produce ice crystals .

"The eurozone has fallen into a double dip recession, as the debt crisis even managed to slow Germany's powerhouse economy to a virtual standstill. The 17-country bloc - which generates a fifth of global output - shrank by 0.1 per cent between July and September and by 0.2 per cent in the previous three months. Two falls in a row means a double dip recession. And this time, Germany and France, the eurozone's biggest economies, could not save the region from a double-dip even though both their economies grew by 0.2 per cent. The news comes a day after violence erupted in cities across Europe as protesters took to the streets in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece and France to demonstrate against tough government austerity measures. Scroll down for video . Popular unrest: Protesters take part in a demonstration during a general strike in Valencia, Spain . The Europe-wide cuts have proved divisive with EU policymakers saying they are crucial to . ending the debt crisis but others blame them for the economic nosedive. Italy and Spain are in the worst state, having been contracting for a year already, while Greece is suffering an outright depression. The good news is that while the European Commission predicts a 0.4 per cent contraction for the eurozone in the whole of 2012, it believes it will grow 0.1 per cent in 2013. Experts hope that that growth, while small, will increase year on year. Riot police were forced to protect the Portuguese parliament from angry protesters yesterday, while rubber bullets were fired on the streets of Madrid, and there were running battles with police in Milan and Rome, and clashes in Paris and Lille. Meanwhile, Germany's predicament is prompting particular concern among economists, as the eurozone crisis takes an increasingly severe toll on its normally robust economy. No respite: Germany and France, led by Francois . Hollande, left, and Angela Merkel, right, could not save the bloc from a . double-dip even though . both countries managed 0.2 per cent growth in the recent quarter . Showing solidarity: Protesters in Berlin, Germany, join European day of action against austerity measures . The signs are that after months of resilience, Europe's largest economy is seeing its companies unnerved by the crisis and demand for its goods in the eurozone and abroad dry up. While German gross domestic product expanded by 0.5 per cent in the first quarter, it slowed to 0.3 per cent in the second and weakened again to 0.2 per cent in the third. Economists expect a worse performance in the fourth quarter. Howard Archer, economist at . forecaster IHS Global Insight, said the latest figures confirm that the . eurozone is now in modest recession 'in all senses of the word'. 'In . reality, the eurozone was already in recession in most senses of the . word as a current record unemployment rate of 11.6 per cent would . testify,' he said. 'Indeed, . the third quarter of 2012 marked the third eurozone quarter-on-quarter . GDP drop in four quarters (broken only by flat GDP in the first quarter . of 2012) and left GDP down by 0.6 per cent year-on-year.' SPAIN: A car set on fire by protesters on an industrial estate cuts off access to the city Lugo in northwestern Spain . PORTUGAL: A riot policeman with a dog runs past a fire which has been set by protesters in Lisbon . Archer . added that with the eurozone seemingly headed for further GDP . contraction in the fourth quarter, and the underlying inflation . situation in the region looking far from alarming, the European Central . Bank was likely to cut interest rates from 0.75 per cent to 0.50 per . cent sooner rather than later. He said an interest rate cut in December was very possible. Paul De Grauwe, an economist with the London School of Economics, said: 'We are now getting into a double dip recession which is entirely self-made. 'It is a result of excessive austerity in southern countries and unwillingness in the north to do anything else,' he said. MADRID: Police and protesters clash during the general ""European Day of Action and Solidarity"" strike against the government austerity measures . SPAIN: A protester is dragged away by police in Madrid, Spain . 'Countries in the south have to . reduce their deficits, but they cannot if those in the north with a . surplus are not willing to help with stimulus. This divide, even . hostility, between countries is stronger than I have seen in the last 20 . years. 'The degree of . austerity has now put so many people in terrible conditions that they . reject all of this. That's a very dangerous situation.' Martin van Vliet, economist at Dutch . bank ING, said the 0.1 per cent eurozone contraction was not a surprise . after the German and French numbers, and it could have been worse. 'What . you notice is that the recession in southern Europe is slowly creeping . to other countries. Look at the Netherlands, with a strong contraction, . and Austria, also with a small contraction. There was no contraction in . Belgium and Finland but the second quarter was very bad.' Burning issue: Riot police officers face protesters during a demonstration outside the Portuguese Parliament in Lisbon . Cornered: Riot police officers protect themselves from a projectile at the end of a demonstration organized by Spain's 'indignant' protesters . Stand off: Demonstrators push fences to make a barricade during clashes with riot police after a protest near the Spanish parliament in Madrid turned violent . Across Spain: Police agents and civil guards clash with protesters trying to prevent buses from leaving the bus depot in Salamanca, Spain . 'If you look at the indicators for the fourth quarter you see that even Germany may not grow again.' Meanwhile, . France's prime minister assured a German audience on Thursday that his . country is committed to getting its debt under control, and said that is . essential to preserving France's sovereignty. Jean-Marc . Ayrault's first visit in Germany since taking office in May comes as . concerns grow that France's economy, the eurozone's second-largest, is . weakening just as the government has to slash spending to reduce its . deficit. France is Berlin's most important ally in fighting Europe's . debt crisis. France is committed to 'stop burdening future generations with continuously rising debt and restore the necessary leeway for political actions,' Ayrault told a gathering of German business leaders. He stressed that 'we are aware that getting the public finances in order is also the precondition for our sovereignty.' According to official figures published Thursday, France narrowly avoided falling into recession in the third quarter. Its economy expanded 0.2 percent in the July-September period from the previous quarter - as did that of Germany, where growth is slowing. President Francois Hollande's Socialist government has promised to rein in massive government spending and reduce the deficit, largely by raising taxes. But the country has watched unemployment tick steadily up as a raft of companies announced layoffs in recent months. The jobless rate now stands at 10.8 percent, according to European statistics.","Eurozone shrank by 0.1 per cent in the July-September .

But it is not only for display as it is available to other plane enthusiasts, nervous flyers and even professional pilots to practice in . Inside the cockpit: Luckily, Miss Mabey (right) does not have a problem with the lack of space in the bedroom . Mr Davis, who developed his aviation obsession as a child, said was forced to give up his wish to become a pilot as he was not good enough at mathematics. Instead, he spent his time and money . building the precise replica cockpit by hand - crafting it into the space he had in his spare bedroom at his two-bedroom home. The Boeing 747-400 has now 'flown' at least 47,000 miles around the world - with Mr Davis earning up to £3,000 a month. The former graphic designer, who mans the simulator full-time, said: 'I always longed to be a pilot but now I have the next best thing.

'The simulator is so life-like that I have lots of commercial airline pilots coming for a flight. I get to rub shoulders with professional pilots and it’s great that they are so impressed by my simulator.' Mr Davis, who actually owns only a gliders licence, charges £75 for an hour-long flight, or £125 for two hours. Couple: Mr Davis , pictured with his partner, Allyson Mabey, charges £75 for an hour-long flight . He said customers visited his house up to seven days a week - saying: 'The simulator is very popular and we often have couples come for the experience. 'It’s amazing how the ladies respond to it. Many women come with their partners and bring a book, but by the end of the flight they want to have a go themselves.' Luckily, Mr Davis's partner, Allyson Mabey, does not have a problem with the constant stream of visitors, nor the lack of space in the bedroom. 'I will admit I was surprised when John first told me about the simulator,' said the 53-year-old nurse. 'It is very unusual and it’s not every day you meet someone who has a plane in their back bedroom. 'I was astounded when I first saw the simulator in real life. To look at John’s house you would never guess there was a plane in the back room.' She added: 'I haven’t flown it myself as there are a lot of things to learn - I leave that to John as he is so passionate. 'But I have sat in it a few times and every time I am just fascinated by the simulator, because it’s so technical and intricate.' In order to build his pride and joy, Mr Davis studied photographs of Boeing 747-400 cockpits online - and he managed to order most of the parts for the aircraft off the internet. The light deck panels are made out of MDF wood, while the pilot and two passenger chairs are made out of old leather car seats. He spent a large amount of his budget for the simulator on the electronics and high-tech equipment. Popular: Mr Davis said customers visited his house up to seven days a week - saying: 'The simulator is very popular and we often have couples come for the experience.' He added: 'It's amazing how ladies respond to it' There is an auto-pilot system . and a six-foot screen with two 19inch monitors - creating the . all-important panoramic view of the simulated landscape. 'For . me it is important to make the flight feel as lifelike as possible so I . have invested in a great sound system with a subwoofer which vibrates . so my passengers can get the experience of take-off and landing,' he . said. At work: Mr Davis even uses his simulator to help people with a fear of flying, by letting them sit through a realistic flight experience . Mr Davis, who always wears his full pilot uniform when taking a flight, even carries out in-flight announcements telling passengers to 'fasten their seatbelts'. 'My passengers can fly from Birmingham International or London Gatwick to Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport to on their first flight and then progress further afield to the Canary Islands if they fancy,' he said. 'It does take a while to learn your way around the cockpit as there are 90 different switches and three sound systems. 'It has taken me thousands of hours in man power to create this craft and even more in money, but I am pleased to now be earning a living from it. It’s the best job in the world - after being a real pilot.' Mr Davis even uses his simulator to help people with a fear of flying, by letting them sit through a realistic flight experience on his £125 two-hour flying awareness course. 'The aim is to help people who are nervous about flying by letting them get used to the feel and sounds of a real plane,' he said.

"Whoever thought up the phrase doggy paddle has obviously never met Morph, an cat who is more than happy to take a dip in the pool. Swimming helps relieve the 14-year-old feline's arthritis, stimulating blood flow, easing pain on the joints, and helping to build strength. According to staff, Morph was less-than-happy about taking the plunge at first, but he is now confident enough to swim laps of the pool at South Coast Hydrotherapy School in Wimborne, Dorset. Morph, a 14-year-old cat, has been taking hydrotherapy lessons to help with his arthritis . The ageing moggy goes for one session every week at the pool in Wimborne, Devon . Morph was reluctant to take the plunge for the first time, but is so confident he now swims laps . While the centre caters for dogs, who are more accustomed to swimming, the treatment with Morph has been so successful that they now plan on rolling it out to cats as well. Jo Scott, principal at South Coast Hydrotherapy School, based at Verwood Hydrotherapy Centre, said: 'The treatment is usually reserved for dogs. 'It is the hydrostatic pressure that helps. It is an all over pressure, helps to ease the joints, mobility, blood flow and circulation while reducing swelling. 'It is a non-weight bearing exercise which is good for building muscles, fitness, weight control and fun.' The centre usually offers its services to dogs, but is now considering allow more cats to come . The therapy helps to relieve arthritis by providing all over pressure which eases the joints and assists blood flow . The South Coast Hydrotherapy School also offers people classes in hydrotherapy treatment for animals . Vaughn Stoman, director of the centre, said: 'It is our philosophy that we are not just happy to treat disease, but we want to see our companions contributing to a more fulfilled and meaning full life. 'That is why we offer clinical treatment as well as the fun stuff like agility, obedience training, hydrotherapy, under water treadmill and puppy classes. 'Here you are not just a clinical case, we like to build a relationship with you and your pet, one you can trust.' The centre is not the only place to offer swimming classes for dogs. As well as treating medical conditions the sessions can also help obese animals work out and lose weight . Vaughn Stoman, director of the centre, said: 'It is our philosophy that we are not just happy to treat disease, but we want to see our companions contributing to a more fulfilled and meaningful life' In the US, the Happy Tails resort in Virginia offers swimming classes for canines, giving them two ramps and a pool to play on with several pets at a time having a go. The pool is part of a 12,000ft luxury care centre with custom made beds, recessed lighting and piped in music for the pets. It also features the indoor pool, which has two ladders for the dogs to get in and out and is surrounded by decking so they can have a lie down when they get tired.","South Coast Hydrotherapy School offers hydrotherapy for pets .

"Boss: Irfan 'Chubbs' Nasser, pictured by secret services, was too fat to run around with a gun at a terrorist training camp in Pakistan so learned how to make bombs instead . The 'four lions' gang that planned the biggest terrorist atrocity the UK has faced in a generation was led by a 23-stone chemist deemed too fat to be a suicide bomber. Nicknamed 'Chubbs' and 'Big Irfan' by his fellow plotters, it was Irfan Naseer's . bulky frame that helped him to work on his bomb-making skills while at training camps in Pakistan. The 31-year-old was too overweight to go on physical training exercises, and admitted he was mixing chemicals rather than 'running up and down the . mountains with weapons'. Naseer gained an A at A Level chemistry, and honed his skills during a . four year pharmaceuticals course at Aston University in Birmingham, . coming out with a 2:2 degree in 2003. He barely worked afterwards and spent his time showing his fellow terrorists how to make a bomb out of sports . injury treatments. His fascination for science first began during experiments at school while studying for GCSE chemistry classes, when the teacher showed him how to distil chemicals with a Bunsen burner. 'When I was doing my GCSEs, one of the teachers did an experiment where he had a Bunsen burner and he threw a chemical on to the fire', he told the court. 'It caused a massive flame which blackened the roof, and that kind of got me into it.' After a raid on the group's headquarters in Birmingham, Naseer had chemistry textbooks left over from his university days on his book shelves in his bedroom, mixed in with a Jihadi flag and terrorist handbooks. Training camps: 'Big Irfan' Naseer (right) and 'Little Irfan' Khalid were caught on CCTV going back and forth to Pakistan to receive instruction on plotting their attack on Britain . Arrest: Irfan Naseer, right, who weighs 23 stone, was picked up by police as he drove the rest of the gang to get a takeaway in 2011 . Headquarters: The group's safe house in Birmingham was filled with Big Irfan's chemistry books, mixed with  terrorist handbooks and a computer used to search for the Anarchist's Cookbook . He had also searched repeatedly online for bomb making tips and details of how to concoct homemade explosives. Among his Internet search history was a website containing the Anarchist's Cookbook. Big Irfan admitted in court he had spent eight-and-a-half years memorising the Koran, from the age of 19. He . wanted to treat himself to a quad bike in the run up to his martyrdom . and was overheard telling his fellow plotters: 'It's good fun, yeah, but . I wouldn't do it on the road - that's not befitting, bro. A guy with a . beard and that sitting on top of that doesn't look good.' The chemist: Naseer gained an A at A Level chemistry, and honed his skills during a four year pharmaceuticals course at Aston University in Birmingham, coming out with a 2:2 degree in 2003 . Jihadist: Irfan Khalid was bent on killing himself and many others in a terror attack on Britain but refused to give evidence in court so his motives are unclear . His blood-thirsty lieutenant was Irfan Khalid, 27, who has steadfastly refused to reveal anything about his terrorist activities or intentions, and did not give evidence in court. Dubbed 'Little Irfan' to distinguish him from the heftier Naseer, he had previously worked as a security guard in March 2010. Khalid, also nicknamed Sylvester, is only recorded as completing two shifts, and this was his only known job. Khalid joined Naseer on their two journeys to Pakistan, recording suicide videos while they were out there and boasting about the contents on their return. He was recorded by police chillingly predicting he would be dead by June 2011, but how he was propelled to this deadly aim remains largely a mystery. Born March 1, 1985, he was born and raised in Birmingham in the same Muslim-dominated community as his fellow plotters. Records show he was an erstwhile student at Solihull College between 2001 and 2003, and emerged with a handful of qualifications. He achieved a Level One key skills qualification in information technology during his time at the college, as well as completing a course in Access to Further Education Services. But this did not lead to a full time job, and there are no records of Khalid paying tax in the intervening period. Khalid, like Ali, also suffered from vision problems and needed contacts lenses after suffering a head injury at some point in his past. Irfan Naseer left and Irfan Khalid holding buckets undertaking bogus charity collections in Birmingham . Ashik Ali, 27, who joked that the band of terrorists were like the cell depicted in Chris Morris comedy film 'Four Lions', and aped the main character by distancing himself from his wife to protect her . Finally there was Ashik Ali, 27,  who joked that the band of terrorists were like the cell depicted in Chris Morris comedy film 'Four Lions', and aped the main character by distancing himself from his wife to protect her. Prosecutors showed he was secretly recorded telling Salma Kabal that he was planning to head abroad for Jihad, and later confessed the split from his wife was to insulate her from the terrorist intentions. He referenced Four Lions directly in the calls, and prosecutors argued successfully that although he was half-joking, Ali was taking his role as a terrorist very seriously. Ali's own defence offered up another alternative explanation, however. That Ali was propelled towards suicide martyrdom because of despair at the break-up of his marriage. He told the court he split from Kabal in the summer of 2010 after she moved in with her parents while they looked for somewhere to live together. The newly-married couple slept on a mattress in the living room in cramped conditions for a while before she finally put an end to the relationship. Texts from Ali show him begging for a second chance to make the marriage work, but he was apparently spurned time and time again. In one telling message. he claimed that he knew what it would be like to kill others because his own life had been shattered by their divorce. He wrote: 'I would know how it feels because you destroyed mine, when I begged you that night not to leave me but you did. 'That was the day when both of our lives were destroyed.' Ali is severely visually impaired and was forced to read documents in court on a large screen. His vision is so bad that he struggles to make out the facial expressions of people he is talking to and requires large print to read anything. Joker: Ashik Ali (right), pictured street collecting with Little Irfan Khalid, compared the group to the gang in the film Four Lions and wanted to die a martyr after his marriage break-up . He also suffers hearing difficulties because of a botched attempt to syringe wax out of his own ears.When . detectives raided his home, they found he had downloaded nearly 150 . Islamic lectures from the Internet, including extremist rants, and . passed them on to Irfan Naseer. Among . the hoard of videos were lectures by radical preacher Anwar al-Awlaki, . an Al Qaeda cleric killed by a US drone attack in Yemen in 2010 just 12 . days after the trio were arrested. Ali . converted his home in White Street, Birmingham into a fledgling bomb . factory, where chemicals could be distilled by the terrorist crew. He had only recently moved to the address after the breakdown of his marriage to Kabal. [caption . Ali's . defence barristers tried to paint him as merely a 'chai wallah' who . provided refreshments to his friends but was only joking when taped . discussing suicide bombing plans. But Ali was also the one who scouted out a possible loan from Barclays Bank to set up the Dawah shop cover. His CV contained a tissue of lies, included inflated exam grades and claims he was a gym instructor when in fact he worked as a receptionist. He claimed to have GCSE C or D grades for subjects such as English, Maths and Science, when in reality, he had achieved no higher than an E. His CV also falsely stated that he had been regional manager for the Ummah Welfare Trust charity, when he had just been a collector. Prior to his arrest, Ali was running a legitimate business repairing bicycles for £25 a time, but his disabilities meant he sometimes took two days on just one repair and it was not a business he could live off.","Irfan Naseer learned bomb-making abroad because he was too unfit to run .

"Scientists believe they have finally solved the mystery of the Abominable Snowman. Its identity? Er … a big brown bear. DNA tests on supposed yeti hair samples have revealed a genetic match with an ancient polar bear. Scientists believe there could be a sub-species of brown bear in the High Himalayas descended from the ancient animal. Scroll down for video . Truth unfolded: The mystery of the ancient tale of the Abominable Snowman may finally be solved . Yetis, also known as the Abominable Snowman, have been recorded for centuries in the Himalayas, with local people and mountaineers claiming to have seen hairy, ape-like creatures. Bryan Sykes, professor of human genetics at Oxford University, set out to collect and test ‘yeti’ hair samples to find out which species they came from. In particular he analysed hairs from two unknown animals, one found in the Western Himalayan region of Ladakh and the other from Bhutan, 800 miles to the east. After subjecting the hairs to the most advanced DNA tests available and comparing the results to other animals’ genomes stored on the GenBank database, Professor Sykes found that he had a 100 per cent match with a sample from an ancient polar bear jawbone found in Svalbard, Norway, that dates back at least 40,000 years - and probably around 120,000 years - a time when the polar bear and closely related brown bear were separating as different species. Professor Sykes believes that the most likely explanation is that the animals are hybrids - crosses between polar bears and brown bears. The species are closely related and are known to interbreed where their territories overlap. Myth or reality? Hairs from two animals found in the Himalayas were a 100 per cent match to an ancient polar bear jaw bone from Norway . The professor said: ‘This is an exciting and completely unexpected result that gave us all a surprise. There’s more work to be done on interpreting the results. I don’t think it means there are ancient polar bears wandering around the Himalayas. ‘But we can speculate on what the possible explanation might be. It could mean there is a sub species of brown bear in the High Himalayas descended from the bear that was the ancestor of the polar bear. Or it could mean there has been more recent hybridisation between the brown bear and the descendent of the ancient polar bear.’ A photograph of a ‘yeti’ footprint, taken by British climber Eric Shipton at the base of Everest, sparked global mania after it was taken in 1951. Legendary mountaineer Reinhold Messner, who became the first man to climb Everest without oxygen, has studied yetis since he had a terrifying encounter with a mysterious creature in Tibet in 1986. His own research backs up the Prof Sykes’ theory. He uncovered an image in a 300-year-old Tibetan manuscript of a ‘Chemo’ - another local name for the yeti, with text alongside it which was translated to read: ‘The yeti is a variety of bear living in inhospitable mountainous areas.’ Prof Sykes added: ‘Bigfootologists and other enthusiasts seem to think that they’ve been rejected by science. Science doesn’t accept or reject anything, all it does is examine the evidence and that is what I’m doing.’ His investigations features in a new three-part Channel 4 documentary series, Bigfoot Files, which starts on Sunday. A book by Prof Sykes about his research, The Yeti Enigma: A DNA Detective Story, is to be published next spring.","Tests of 'Yeti hair' found to match an ancestor of the modern polar bear .

"Live bears were used by the American military to test the safety of the pilot ejection capsule on the world's first supersonic jet bomber, it has emerged. The B-58 Hustler was created in the 1950s during the height of the cold war.

Test dummies: The U.S. Air Force used Himalayan and American black bears to test the aircraft's ejection system which rocketed pilots into the sky before automatically opening into a parachute . But the plane had several issues - including that the crew could not use the emergency ejection system when the plane was flying at Mach 2. A new ejection was designed so crew could evacuate at any time but the U.S. Air Force wanted to test the safety of the aircraft's ejection system before letting its elite pilots try it out. A pre-ejection handle yanked the pilot's legs in close before enclosing him in a shell that still allowed rudimentary control of the plane, i09.com reports. The actual ejection handle then sent the capsule up with a rocket burst and automatically deployed a parachute. The capsule could float and contained survival supplies in the event of a crash.

"A Brazilian surfer could have ridden one of the biggest waves in history today as waves of up to 100ft created by St Jude's storm battered the European coast. While many risked their lives going out into the waters this morning, witnesses believe it was surger Carlos Burle who rode the tallest wave - possibly beating the world record set by Hawaiian surfer Garrett McNamara in 2011. McNamara's wave was estimated to be 78ft tall, but the waves hitting off the coast of Portugal near Nazare were noticeably taller. 'It was luck. We never know when we will be catching the wave. I still hadn't surfed any wave and everyone had already had their rides,' Mr Burle told Surfer Today. Daredevil surfer Carlos Burle rides down what is believed to be one of the biggest waves ever conquered at Nazare, Portugal. The exact size of the wave Burle rode is yet to be determined, but it is believed to be close to challenging McNamara's feat from earlier this year. The incredible moment was captured from the hillside overlooking the bay by Portugese photographer To Mane. Brazilian surfer Carlos Burle surfs a wave at North Beach during a giant swell that hit the Portuguese coast at North Beach, Nazare, Portugal. The Brazilian may have beaten Havaiian Garrett Mcnamara's record for the biggest wave ever surfed at 30 meters that was broken last January also at North Beach, Nazare.

Mr Burle's feat is even more amazing considering he had just saved a fellow Brazilian surfing friend from nearly drowning just before that. Maya Gabeira nearly drowned and had to be . resuscitated on the beach when she fell on a wave and her jet-ski . partner could not get to her in time. She was rescued unconscious and taken to hospital, where she was reportedly doing well despite suffering a broken ankle. 'Maya [Gabeira] almost died.

Help: Surfers apply CPR to fellow surfer Maya Gabeira, from Brazil, who nearly drowned after falling trying to ride a big wave at the Praia do Norte . Father-off-two Andrew Cotton, 34, of . Croyde, North Devon - who is a part-time professional surfer, plumber . and lifeguard - also took on the monster waves off the coast of Portugal at . Praia do Norte, around 8am . this morning. Married Mr . Cotton, whose wife Katie and two children Honey, six, and Ace, one, are . currently braving the storm at home on the Devon coast, was towed into . the waves by his US surfing partner Garrett McNamara. The duo work together in big waves by . towing one another into the swells using a jet-ski, because waves of . that size move so quickly it is impossible to paddle into the wave using . just arm power. English surfer Andrew Cotton rides an 80ft wave at the Praia do Norte, north beach, at the fishing village of Nazare in Portugal . The married father-of-two took on the monster waves caused by Atlantic Storm St Jude . It is not the first time Mr Cotton has been involved in a surfing world record - two years ago he was driving the jet-ski when he towed Mr McNamara into a giant wave at the same spot in 2011. The beach is well-known in surfing circles as a mecca for huge waves because it picks up the full brunt of the violent Atlantic storm swells. Mr Cotton had been avidly monitoring . weather data and eagerly anticipating the waves created by St Jude's . hitting Portugal, but was disappointed because the biggest waves created . by the storm actually hit overnight before sunrise. He said he could hear the waves . pounding the shoreline overnight from inside the beach house he is . staying in, saying the monster swells were even making the walls shake. This . morning Mr Cotton and his team were in the water before light at 6am, . along with scores of other surfers all trying to ride the biggest wave. Mr Cotton said: 'The storm that hit England last night started the waves hitting here last night. The house was shaking last night. We're staying in a house on the beach and I've stayed here before when it's been big and the odd set made the walls shake, but last night the whole thing was just shaking all night.' Crowds watch on as brave British surfer Andrew Cotton glides into an 80ft monster wave . But despite the ominous rumbling, Mr Cotton said he slept remarkably well and was in the water raring to go before light. He caught two waves before the potential record-breaker, which he believes was at around 8am, after he'd been in the sea for about two hours. Mr Cotton described the moment he was towed-in to the monster: 'Garrett heard on the radio that the third wave looked good so he just popped me in there in the perfect position. It was really bumpy, I spent most of the time just trying to stay on my feet, it's like you can't go fast enough, it's not like normal surfing.' Mr Cotton said it is hard for him to judge exactly how big a wave that size is, particularly as he is riding it. He said: 'Everyone wants to put figures on it, there were definitely 80ft waves there today, some even bigger, it was ridiculous, everyone got huge waves today, it was frightening out there. An unidentified surfer wipes out at a giant wave at Praia do Norte during a swell that hit the Portuguese coast, at Nazare, Portugal . 'It's a really dangerous place . because it's not a point break or a headland, it's a beach, so there's . no way round and if you fall you're left swimming in 60ft white water.' Mr . Cotton did fall on the wave after the potential record-breaker because . the wind had become really strong and was making the surface of the . water difficult to ride. He . said: 'It started to get choppy, I wasn't gliding I was literally . bouncing from chop to chop and I ended up catching and edge and just . slammed down. I was under for quite a while.' Mr Cotton is planning on staying in Portugal for the rest of the week as there are further big swells predicted for Wednesday. 'Hopefully . there's more to come but with surfing you could wait ten years for it . to get this big again, I just have to make sure I'm ready when it . comes.'","Witnesses believe Carlos Burle beat the world record for riding the tallest wave today as he surfed the waters off Praia do Norte, Protugal.

"A courageous, sexual abuse survivor has spoken out about her ordeal as her former teacher was jailed for up to 20 years. Jaime Heiner, who is now 18, was groomed for sex by Stephen Niedzwiecki at the age of 14 while she attended Kaysville charter school in Utah. She told the court on Thursday at his sentencing that she feared she would see her abuser's face on her wedding night. Niedzwiecki, then 31, was a teacher and the girls' basketball coach when he began the inappropriate relationship with Miss Heiner. The abuse lasted for more than a year. Scroll down for video . Jaime Heiner, now 18, spoke outside court on Thursday after the teacher who sexually abused her was sent to prison for up to 20 years . The 18-year-old bravely stood up in court on Thursday to face her attacker. She testified that she is haunted by the abuse and at one time, slept on her parents' bedroom floor because she was too afraid to be on her own. 'I fear that I will see Mr. Niedzwiecki’s face on my wedding night,' she said, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. The ex-teacher was sentenced on Thursday . after he pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual activity and conduct with a . minor female student. He initially faced 11 charges but struck a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty to four counts of unlawful sexual activity and unlawful sexual conduct. They were reduced from first to third-degree felonies as part of a plea deal. Niedzwiecki groomed his teenage student for sex when she was 14 . Jaime Heiner spoke out following the trial with the support of her parents. Miss Heiner told Fox: 'When the judge read his finding, I started crying because I was so happy that justice was going to get served and that he couldn’t hurt any other young women.' She added: 'I don’t consider myself a victim. 'I see myself as a survivor. Because victim is a word that gives him power over me, whereas survivor is a word that gives me that power.' Miss Heiner spoke before the court at Niedzwiecki's sentencing where she asked the judge to make the sentence as harsh as possible. She told the court: 'When he began to pursue me sexually I did not know how to respond to him and I froze. 'Over and over again I froze. I never physically fought back and often submitted to his demands, but that does not mean I was consenting.' The judge sentenced Niedzwiecki to serve up to 20 years behind bars. Judge Allphin told the court: 'He introduced her to sexual acts that she had never heard of, let alone experienced. He committed despicable acts.' The brave teenager left court with her parents on Thursday. They supported her decision to reveal her identity following the sexual abuse by a teacher . The student met Niedzwiecki when she . was on the girl's basketball team. She had never had a boyfriend and . knew little about sex. The relationship had been inappropriate from when the girl was a freshman, the court heard, before turning sexually abusive in summer 2011. It took place outside of school grounds in a number of places like Niedzwiecki's home. She said that her 31-year-old teacher's sexual advances caused her to freeze and she often submitted to demands. Niedzwiecki . begged for mercy to the judge and apologized to Miss Heiner and her . family. He said that he was in therapy and had completed a repentance . process at his church.

"When Kellie Bohrer saw a Siberian Husky for sale for just $320 online - about $700 cheaper than the market rate - she thought it was too good to be true. She should have trusted her instinct. The 19-year-old is now more than $3000 out-of-pocket and without a puppy after falling victim to an online 'Nigerian-style' scam which authorities say is becoming increasingly common. Scroll down for video . Cheated: Scammers sent Kellie Bohrer this picture of a Siberian Husky which she thought she had purchased . 'I really didn't understand what was happening': Kellie Bohrer is $3000 out of pocket and without a dog after being tricked by online puppy scammers . Bohrer, from Colorado, told CBS 4 she contacted the seller after seeing an advertisement for a purebred Husky on dogoodle.com. She thought it was a good deal, as these dogs normally sell for at least $1000. The seller sent her cute pictures of the dog and an authentic-looking registration certificate. But then the trouble started. Bohrer said the agency called and needed $1600 upfront for insurance to ship the dog from Washington state to Bohrer's Aurora home.

Another email followed, demanding $4500 to get the dog out of 'puppy quarantine' in Las Vegas. 'We’re like this isn’t right,' Bohrer said.

'Being 19, I really didn’t understand what was happening,' a tearful Bohrer said. 'I don’t want other people to suffer.' Federal Bureau of Investigations spokesman Dave Joly said consumers had to do their research to avoid scammers. 'Treat this as a business transaction.

"The poster that has appeared around Cambridge offers students 'easy cash' for information . Animal rights extremists are offering undergraduates at Cambridge University money in exchange for personal details of students involved with experiments on animals. A newly founded network known as the National Operation Anti-Vivisection (NOAV) has covered parts of Cambridge in posters encouraging students to ‘shop’ their peers for cash. It asks for personal details of scientists at the university, including names, pictures, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses, with the tag line: ‘Do the right thing and earn some money, what could be better?’ The anti-animal testing organisation, which claims to be a grass-roots network of animal rights activists, says animal experimentation is ‘cruel, outdated and unscientific’. NOAV says it wants people to ‘name and shame’ students that experiment on animals for science because ‘they should not be given the cover of anonymity’ and that ‘social pressure is the best way to get them to reconsider that career choice.’ Spokesman William Evans told student newspaper Varsity: ‘It is high time that universities move into the 21st century and start promoting human relevant research, such as computer modelling and micro-dosing.’ He added that the campaign is intended to be ‘non-threatening, peaceful and legal’, saying: ‘We will not be disclosing and personal addresses or phone numbers that we receive, as our approach is based on social as opposed to physical pressure.’ But concerns have been raised after the dozens of posters appeared to entice students by advertising it as a chance to ‘earn some beer money’ in return for information. Tom Holder, who founded advocacy group Speaking of Research - which supports the use of animal experiments in scientific tests where merited - condemned the incentive scheme as ‘targeting students’. The posters ask students to 'shop' on their peers and provide contact details such as name and phone number . National Operation Anti-Vivisection says animal experimentation is ‘cruel, outdated and unscientific’ The Oxford graduate, who calls NOAV animal rights 'extremists', has warned that the hostile environment  may force young science students out of a career in the sciences. He posted on his blog: ‘Stalking and harassing students is not a legitimate way of running a campaign. ‘It is these sorts of actions which can force brilliant minds out of the life sciences out of fear.’ In a letter addressed to budding scientists and posted on its website, NOAV states: ‘You can choose to perpetuate the outdated, cruel and scientifically flawed notion that data from non-human animals can be accurately extrapolated to human beings. ‘The public are against animal experiments and you will become a social pariah, not wanting to reveal the disgusting/socially unacceptable job that you do to anyone but the closest of friends. ‘You will be subject to continual protest from animal rights activists throughout your life, and will not get a moment’s peace from the ongoing aggressive but lawful pressure exerted by the animal rights movement.’ Cambridge University has been targeted by the group, but other university towns are also set to be hit . Other university towns across the country have also reportedly been targeted in the campaign, but Cambridge has so far been the city receiving the most attention. It is thought that a plan by British multinational pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to build a headquarters in Cambridge is one reason for the focus. A campaign against Huntingdon Life Sciences, in Cambridgeshire, by Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty came to an end in August this year after 15 years of protesting. The organisation, which has been subject of a long campaign, has seen several of its activists given prison sentences and announced it would disband after tougher laws were introduced.","National Operation Anti-Vivisection (NOAV) posters appeared around city .

"We all know Britain’s weather is up and down, but the last few days of January will see it at its topsy-turvy best. After the freezing temperatures of the last week, it’s going to get as warm as Spain. Some of us might even venture out without a coat as bright sunshine helps temperatures climb to 10C (50F) from today. Scroll down for video .

Animation: This shows the jet stream moving to the south of the UK, with colder air from the Arctic going southwards to affect the UK . But be warned, by the end of this week, you may be building a snowman or cursing traffic chaos caused by an icy whiteout. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather alert ahead of the cold snap with wintry showers expected in northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland on Wednesday and Thursday. The warning urges drivers to be safe on the roads and to be prepared for possible weather-related delays. Some areas could see snow of up to 2in on low levels and more than 4in on higher ground. By the weekend, temperatures will again dip below zero. The Met Office has issued a 'level two' cold weather alert, which warns of an 80 per cent chance of severe weather between Wednesday and Sunday. John Lee, a forecaster at MeteoGroup, said: ‘There is a definite trend for it getting colder as the week goes on. 'Be aware': The Met Office has  severe weather warnings for snow in place for northern parts of Britain on Wednesday (left) and Thursday (right) Three-day forecast: Strong and gusty winds are likely to accompany snow showers and lead to significantly reduced visibility at times .

Sussex sunshine: While the conditions were pleasant in Hastings today, a severe weather warning is in place for the North West later this week . 'There will be an increased risk of snow towards the end of the week. 'We will already see wintry showers from Wednesday in some parts of the country. ‘By the weekend there is a risk of snow anywhere. It will definitely be cold enough.’ The predicted snow at the end of the week combined with strong winds could mean reduced visibility for drivers. The Met Office said: ‘An active cold front is expected to push south-east across the UK during Wednesday introducing an increasingly cold and unstable air mass. ‘Showers will become frequent and heavy, increasingly falling as snow in the North and West, and driven well inland by strong to gale force north-westerly winds. Accumulating snow is likely, especially overnight.’ Wintry scene: The Wiltshire countryside had a beautiful covering of frost around Malmesbury and the River Avon yesterday .

People have been advised to stay indoors and look out for friends and family who may be vulnerable to the cold as the chill factor sets in because of northerly winds. Dr Angie Bone, head of extreme events team at Public Health England, said: ‘Although many parts of the country have already seen colder weather this winter, it does look like we're in for a further spell with bitter winds and snow showers likely to make it feel particularly cold. ‘In this sort of weather we know that older people and people in poor health tend to stay indoors. ‘While this is sensible, it's worth remembering these people may need help getting to a hospital or GP appointment, with shopping or prescription fetching, or just someone to talk to. ‘If you know someone in this situation, and most of us do, think about what you can you do to help out. ‘Contrary to popular belief, it's actually working age adults who have most slips and trips outside in cold and icy weather, not older people, which is why it's important to wear shoes with a good, slip-resistant grip to prevent any accidental falls. Fresh: Temperatures yesterday morning in the South were only -5C but forecasters predict it will become milder today. Pictured: Cambridge . Peaceful: Despite the chilly weather and snowfall in some northern regions, there were some spells of sunshine across Cambridge yesterday . Cosy: One group made the most of a red, fluffy blanket to keep warm as they enjoyed their tour of Cambridge along the famous River Cam . ‘Although most of our advice on keeping warm and well in cold weather may seem like common sense, it's important to remember that cold kills, even in places where the temperatures aren't at their lowest.’ The drop will be a sharp contrast to the mild temperatures of around 10C (50F) – the same as those predicted for Madrid – at the beginning of this week. On Wednesday night many will begin to feel the cold again with temperatures falling to -2C in the North and -1C in the South. In the North, sleet and snow are expected to cover the ground overnight with wintry showers and winds blasting the South. Despite the cold snap, nature experts say spring is already well on the way. Sightings of snowdrops, hazel catkins and even ladybirds and butterflies have been submitted to the Woodland Trust’s Nature’s Calendar scheme, which asks the public to report natural events which mark the changing seasons. Wake up call: This man appeared rather refreshed after joining swimmers who took to the sea off Brighton yesterday for an early morning dip .

Prepared: One woman opted for gloves and swim hat as she took a dip with fellow members of the Brighton and Hove Sea Swimming Club . So far in 2015, there have been reports of snowdrops at 120 locations across the country and hazel catkins in 74 areas. In November, the Trust received a record of frogspawn on the Lizard Peninsula, Cornwall, the earliest such incidence for nine years. Research looking at nature records stretching back to the 18th century has found flowers over the last 25 years blooming up to 12 days earlier than previously. This year’s sightings come after the warmest year on record for the UK. The current freezing conditions may halt the march of spring, but conservationists say that causes less of a problem than a late cold snap, as happened in 2013, when more species are likely to be awake from hibernation or already flowering.

"From fireball-toting Vikings parading through the streets of Edinburgh to the Romanian farmers who believe their animals temporarily gain the power of speech, New Year's Eve has just as many weird and wonderful traditions of Christmas. Now some of the most bizarre have been unveiled in a global poll by a social networking website, with Scottish Viking celebrations among those deemed most odd. Also included on the list was the old Irish custom of banging bread on the walls to scare away evil spirits and the South African tradition of throwing old furniture out of the window on the stroke of midnight. Don't rain on my parade! A Scottish Viking marches through the streets of Edinburgh with a fiery torch in hand . Ghoulish: Locals in Talca, Chile, like to welcome the new year in the graveyard with dead relations . Most bizarre of all, according to the users of social networking website Badoo, is one unique to a small town in central Chile which sees locals gather in the graveyard on New Year's Eve to welcome the new year in the company of departed relatives. Talca’s custom of gathering in the . municipal cemetery on New Year’s Eve is thought to have started when one . local family broke into the graveyard on the last night of the year to . be near their dead father. The . town’s mayor now opens the graveyard gates at 11pm on New Year’s . Eve and thousands of locals stream into the candle-lit necropolis to celebrate while classical music plays. The tradition also reflects a broader Latin American custom of . remembering the dead on the annual Day of the Dead, typically held in early . November. 'It’s . not a mournful time but a wonderful, happy way for families to get . together and preserve the memory of loved ones who have died,' explains Mary . Andrade, the author of Day . of the Dead: A Passion for Life. Chatty? According to Romanian tradition, if animals gain the power of speech, bad times are on the way . Freezing: A man emerges from Lake Baikal after diving in with a dead tree to celebrate New Year's Eve . Another one bites the dust: Locals in Johannesburg celebrate by flinging old furniture out of the window . 'The belief that the soul comes back . every year, to be honoured by relatives, is a legacy of pre-Hispanic . civilizations that believed in life after this life.' In second place is a Romanian ritual, which has proved . particularly popular with farmers, that involves trying to hear animals speaking. If they . succeed, it’s a bad omen; if they fail, it’s good luck. Considered almost as bizarre is the custom of throwing furniture from windows to welcome the new year, which is popular all over the world, although it’s practised with the most gusto in the Hillsboro district of Johannesburg. There, locals celebrate by flinging everything from old microwaves to entire beds through the window, often from tall buildings, causing a headache for local police in the process. Rounding off the top five was a chilly tradition from Siberia that involves cutting a hole in the ice covering . Lake Baikal and diving to the bottom while carrying a New Year’s . tree. Although Scotland's Viking tradition could only muster eighth place on the list, another Scottish tradition proved more popular. The Loony Dook, which involves stripping off and plunging into a freezing river, was deemed one of the most entertaining customs by Badoo users, along with Venice's mass-kissing tradition which takes place annually on the stroke of midnight in the historic San Marco square.

"By the time you change your relationship status from 'in a relationship' to 'it's complicated', Facebook may already know. According to a study by Cornell University, the social media site can tell how 'connected' a couple are by studying their groups of friends. The paper, called Romantic Partnerships and the Dispersion of Social Ties: A Network Analysis of Relationship Status on Facebook, employs graphs and algorithms to analyse relationships. Facebook: According to a study by Cornell University, the social media site can tell how 'connected' a couple are by studying their groups of friends . Researchers looked at 1.3million Facebook users listed as being in a relationship and worked out how big their network of friends is and how many mutual friends they have. The results, they say, mean people who have the same social circle on Facebook are less likely to stay together. Relationships betwen different people on the site were taken into account including family members, co-workers, distant acquaintances as well as spouses. The team behind the paper said 'dispersion', the way friends are linked together, was the way they measured how strong relationships are in their random sample. Study: It concluded that people with their own, separate, networks of friends were better in a relationship . 'Our measure of dispersion looks not just at the number of mutual friends of two people,' the study says, 'but also at the network structure on these mutual friends; roughly, a link between two people has high dispersion when their mutual friends are not well connected to one another.' It concluded that people with their own, separate, networks of friends were better in a relationship. The report also says it doesn't matter how strong the tie to particular friends are, it is more important to have a wide range of people in your social circle.","People with more mutual friends more likely to break up .

"Archaeologists have unearthed a palace in what they believe is the fortified Judean city of Shaarayim, where the Bible states King David battled the giant Goliath. The discovery of what is thought to be King David's palace, measuring 1,000 square metres, was made by Hebrew University and the Israel Antiquities Authority. Over the past seven years the teams have also uncovered a huge storehouse containing pots and artefacts that they believe proves the existence of a ruler in Judah in the tenth century BCE. Archaeologists have unearthed a palace in what they believe is the fortified Judean city of Shaarayim, where David is said to have battled Goliath in the biblical tale. The discovery of what is thought to be King David's palace (an aerial view is pictured) was made by Hebrew University and the Israel Antiquities Authority . 'The ruins are the best example to date of the uncovered fortress city of King David,' professors Yossi Garfinkel and Saar Ganor of Hebrew University said. 'This is indisputable proof of the existence of a central authority in Judah during the time of King David.' The biblical city of Shaarayim is thought to have become the modern city of Khirbet Qeiyafa, which is approximately 30 kilometres south west of Jerusalem. Archeologists also found over 600 ceramic pots at the site, some of which are pictured. According to researchers the number of vessels uncovered indicates they were used for tax collection of agricultural produce . The biblical city of Shaarayim is said to have become the modern city of Khirbet Qeiyafa, approximately 30 kilometres south west of Jerusalem . The professors said that the ruins are  the two largest known buildings to have existed at the time of King David in Jerusalem. They added: 'The southern part of a large palace that . extended across an area of about 1,000 square meters was revealed at . the top of the city. 'The wall enclosing the palace is about 30 metres long and an impressive entrance is fixed through which one descended to the southern gate of the city, opposite the Valley of Elah. 'Around the palace’s perimeter were . rooms in which various installations were found -- evidence of a metal . industry, special pottery vessels and fragments of alabaster vessels . that were imported from Egypt.' The archaeologists collected hundreds of artefacts at the site, including religious objects, seals, pottery and tools typical of the time. The palace is at the centre of the site and is higher than the houses lower in the city. The royal occupants would have had an excellent view of the land, stretching from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Hebron Mountains and Jerusalem in the east. Pictured are the remains of a 30-metre long wall of the palace. The archaeologists believe the ruins are the best example to date of the uncovered fortress city of King David . The palace is at the centre of the site and is higher than the houses lower in the city. Its royal occupants would have had an excellent view of the land. Here the southern gate is visible, opposite the Valley of Elah, where David is said to have defeated Goliath in the biblical tale . It is believed that much of the palace was destroyed 1,400 years after it was built when a fortified farmhouse was erected in its place during the Byzantine period. Professors Garfinkel and Ganor said: 'The palace that is now being revealed and . the fortified city that was uncovered in recent years are another tier . in understanding the beginning of the Kingdom of Judah.' The archaeologists also found a large pillared building which was used as an administrative storeroom. Professor Garfinkel holds an article from his archaeological excavation next to the remains of what is thought to be King David's palace. The palace is one of two royal buildings found in what is believed to be the Kingdom of Judah of the tenth century BCE . The professors said: 'It was in this building the kingdom . stored taxes it received in the form of agricultural produce collected . from the residents of the different villages in the Judean Shephelah. 'Hundreds of large store jars were found . at the site whose handles were stamped with an official seal as was . customary in the Kingdom of Judah for centuries.' They believe the palace and storerooms are evidence . of state-sponsored construction and an administrative organisation . during King David’s reign. The remains of what is thought to be a royal storeroom. It was in this building the kingdom stored taxes it received in the form of agricultural produce collected from the residents of the different villages in the Judean Shephelah . 'This is unequivocal evidence of a kingdom’s existence, which knew to establish administrative centres at strategic points,' said Professors Garfinkel and Ganor. 'To date no palaces have been found that can clearly be ascribed to the early tenth century BCE as we can do now.' The Israel Antiquities Authority said it hoped that the new discoveries will lead to the site becoming a national park. The site of what is thought to be the fortified Judean city of Shaarayim, where David is said to have battled Goliath in the biblical tale. The Israel Antiquities Authority said it hoped that the new discoveries will lead to the site becoming a national park . David was the second king of the United Kingdom of Israel, according to the Hebrew Bible. He was said to be an ancestor of Jesus in the New Testament Gospels of Matthew and Luke. His life is conventionally dated from1040–970 BCE. He is often depicted as a righteous king as well as an acclaimed warrior, musician, and poet. David is central to Jewish, Christian, and Islamic faiths. He is well known as a warrior in the biblical tale of David and Goliath. The account of the battle between David and Goliath is told in 1 Samuel, chapter 17. In the tale, Goliath, the champion of the Philistines, challenges the Israelites to send out a champion to battle. David hears that there is a reward for any man who defeats Goliath and accepts the challenge. David slingshots a stone into Goliath's face and the giant falls to the ground. David cut off his head and became a hero.","Researchers believe they have discovered the palace of King David as well as a large store room of pots and ancient artefacts .

"The young elephant has tugged at his shackled hind leg so often that the manacles have cut through the flesh, leaving it raw. Not that freeing himself would help. A chain on his left front leg means he can move neither forwards, backwards nor sideways. The elephant’s owner has tethered the youngster because he prefers to tend to his small shop in the grounds of the Surabaya Zoo in Indonesia. Scroll down for video . Horrific: Chained by three legs, this juvenile male elephant was one of several animals which Richard Shears saw in clear distress at Surabaya Zoo in East Java, Indonesia. One of its legs had a laceration from being chained all the time, right. The zoo is facing fierce questions about the way it treats its animals . Conditions: A former keeper said more than 50 animals have died at the zoo in three months. This calf's owner tethered it because he preferred to tend to his shop . Painful: Another elephant suffered the same treatment, having a front and hind leg tethered with chains so taut that it was unable to make a single step . Emaciated: This camel's ribs were plain to see as it ate grass in its enclosure. Richard Shears left depressed after seeing animals cooped up together in tiny cages . Sad: A South American brown capuchin monkey looked imploringly out of its cage for several minutes before grabbing a banana and returning to the cage's edge . The capuchin retrieved a banana before returning (left) to stare at Richard Shears. When our reporter visited the closed orangutan enclosure, he saw scores of rats . Overcrowded: One aviary appeared packed to the brim with a mixture of herons and ibises, while another had 150 pelicans crammed into one cage together . Money comes first. And so, day after day, week after week, the elephant stands there, being released from his chains only at the end of each day. Anyone finding the scene depressing, and who turns away to look for more happy animals in the zoo would eventually leave, as I did, utterly depressed. Surabaya Zoo has been branded the worst in the world and when I walked through this animal torture ground I was left in no doubt its reputation was well earned. When one giraffe died, zoo authorities simply built an exhibit of its skeleton . I live near Sydney harbour where it is a joy to watch pelicans gliding low across the waters of Blackwattle Bay. But at the Surabaya Zoo I could only shake my head in despair at the sight of more than 150 pelicans jammed into a cage, trying to share a small pool of water, so tightly packed that they could not even spread their wings, let alone fly. ‘How many pelicans does this zoo need?’ I asked a keeper. ‘They’re not endangered. There’s no need to keep this many penned in.’ He knew what I said, but I received only shrugs. Each step took me through a macabre animal dungeon. While I saw dishes of chopped vegetables for the primates, the ribs of several large animals could be seen. One camel in particular appeared appallingly thin. A capuchin monkey I came across appeared to almost plead to be released. In another cage, a sad rhinocerous hornbill looks up at the blue sky, trying to take off from its perch, but there is no room to flap its wings. Well over 50 animals have died here in the past three months, says Tony Sumampau, a former member of the zoo’s temporary management team, who had finally left in despair. ‘The keepers have stalls that they run selling food and drinks and it’s more important for them to make money than it is to be taking care of their animals.’ The zoo, was opened in 1916 during Dutch colonial rule, and next to nothing has been done to improve it. Instead, more and more animals have been packed in. A report by an independent team set up by Indonesia’s forestry ministry called for the animals be moved to other zoos but nothing has been done. Other zoos refuse to take the animals because of their condition and the fear that many of them carrying diseases. The state of the zoo’s animals came to world-wide attention following the death of a giraffe in 2012 that was found with no less than 20 kilograms of plastic bags in its stomach. They had blown into its enclosure and the keepers had not bothered to pick them up. The giraffe’s death would possibly . have faded from the world’s conscience had it not been for the discovery . of a dead female orangutan, Nanik, in its enclosure a few weeks ago. Orangutans, an endangered species, live up to the age of 60 in . captivity, but Nanik was just 12 years old when she died, a large tumour . being found in her intestines. Sitting . alone is another orangutan. I cannot believe what I see – she is . chewing on the yellow top of a marker pen someone has thrown at her. She . pushes it forward between her lips, then sucks it back into her mouth. I . fear she will soon swallow it. Beside her, rats scurry in and out of . holes in an embankment. Cramped: This Sumatran tiger groaned as it sat in a brick hutch. One tiger last year died after its digestive tract was rotted by the formaldehyde-laced meat it ate . Cruel: The tiger appeared agitated in its small brick hut with a barred window, turning around in tight circles. Meanwhile, the main portion of its cage lay empty . Tiny: The brick hutch which contained the tiger, centre, inside its cage. At first the enclosure appeared to be empty until our reporter heard moans from the window . Bleak: This stark enclosure including a tank full of dirty water contained a solitary African pygmy hippo, pictured - which ironically enough was named Joy . I stare at a Sumatran tiger – or rather just its face – as it peers out from behind the bars of its stone living quarters. One of its brothers, I was told, had been seriously ill with its digestive tract rotted away due to the formaldehyde-laced meat it had been fed. An African lion is reported to have died in pain, adding to the zoo’s shameful catelogue of deaths from starvation, mistreatment and other unnatural causes. Agus Supangkat, a spokesman for the zoo, insisted conditions had improved in the past year, but accepted that ‘we also have issues’. The Jakarta Globe has reported that data it had acquired showed that 43 animals had died at the zoo between July 15 and September 17 this year. The zoo, claims however, that the animals on the list died because they were old or had diseases. The 3,000 or so creatures that live in these appalling conditions are destined to die here, naturally or through neglect, but one thing is certain they will not die happily unless something is done urgently. A final glance at the baby elephant with three legs tethered leaves me in no doubt of that. Sad: A spokesman for the 3,000-animal zoo said conditions were improving and the animals had died because they were old or had diseases . Glum: These two gibbons, animals which usually live in trees, were placed on an island surrounded by a moat, one of several species in a space ill-suited to their needs . Huge pelicans, which can have wingspans of up to 10ft, vied for space at a tiny pool. One cage contained 150 of the birds, which are not endangered . Rat-infested: A female orangutan played with a plastic marker pen in her mouth while a rat, bottom right, poked its head out of one of several holes on the bank . Deer me: 18 deer were spotted living in an enclosure measuring about 30ft by 30ft. In the wild, herds of the animals will cover large amounts of ground . These rare Proboscis monkeys, which oddly were placed in an enclosure full of deer, were not climbing the trees which appeared to have died and turned white . Marooned: A Moor macaque sat on its own on this island, surrounded by water with no trees to climb - only a chopped-down stump where a tree once grew . Surabaya Zoo, whose entrance bears a giant statue of the city's emblem of a crocodile and white shark fighting, left, was visited by Mail reporter Richard Shears, right .

"The family of the late Norman Rockwell has taken exception to a new biography of the American illustrator, saying it contains numerous inaccuracies and poses a ‘phantom theory’ about his sexuality. American Mirror: The Life And Art Of Norman Rockwell, by Deborah Solomon, was published in November. In a statement released by the Norman Rockwell Family Agency on December 23, family members said they found at least 96 factual errors in the book, that the author misused sources and made ‘highly selective’ use of Rockwell's own autobiography My Adventures As An Illustrator. The family of the late Norman Rockwell has taken exception to a new biography, American Mirror: The Life And Art Of Norman Rockwell, which they say contains numerous inaccuracies and poses a 'phantom theory' about his sexuality . Rockwell, who lived in Stockbridge, Mass., illustrated more than 300 covers for the Saturday Evening Post. He died in 1978. The family, in its statement, referred to one passage in the book in which Solomon describes how Rockwell went to schools at recess and stopped little boys on the street, and that such behavior might be seen as problematic in today's world. The passage ignores Rockwell's own explanation in his autobiography that after he persuaded a boy to pose for an illustration, they would go together to ask the child's mother for permission, the family said. ‘She supports this unfounded claim with another phantom theory, that Rockwell was a closeted homosexual,’ the statement read. ‘To link pedophilia and homosexuality in this way is offensive and clearly homophobic.’ Norman Rockwell's 1954 work Girl At Mirror: Author Solomon described the girl's doll, tossed on the floor as 'a bizarrely sexualized object' The Norman Rockwell Family Agency accuses the author of 'highly selective' use of Rockwell's own autobiography My Adventures As An Illustrator . In an interview in October with The Wall Street Journal, Solomon, who also authored biographies of artists Jackson Pollack and Joseph Cornell, was quoted as saying she did not believe Rockwell had homosexual relationships in his life, but added that he preferred male company and that it was possible to discern ‘enormous homo-eroticism’ from his work. In The Runaway, a painting of a burly cop and a little boy on adjacent cafe stools, the cop leans toward the boy ‘as if to emphasize the... tenderness that can form between a grown man and a little boy... the hint of homo-eroticism’ she writes. In Girl At Mirror,’ a young girl in a white slip studies her own reflection — ‘Actually,’ says Solomon, ‘seen from the back, she could be a boy.’ And the girl’s doll, tossed on the floor? ‘A bizarrely sexualized object. With her right hand buried in her petticoats, the doll could almost be masturbating.’ She said she was not attempting to speculate on his psychology. The author did not understand Rockwell as a person, the family said, and dismissed suggestions that he was lonely, moody or frequently depressed. The author did not understand Rockwell as a person, the family said, and dismissed suggestions that he was lonely, moody or frequently depressed . The Runaway: Solomon writes of Rockwell's work that the cop leans toward the boy 'as if to emphasize the... tenderness that can form between a grown man and a little boy... the hint of homo-eroticism' ‘This is absurd. He did not mope, was not a chronic depressive, or a hypochondriac. He went through his trials and storms as we all do, but he was someone who ultimately affirmed life,’ read the statement signed by Rockwell's son, Thomas, and granddaughter, Abigail. The statement, issued by The Norman . Rockwell Family Agency, was released on December 23 in response to a . number of reviews that the agency found were to ready to accept . Solomon’s version of events. The family also said it was troubled that the Norman Rockwell Museum, located in Stockbridge, had endorsed the book. In an Oct. 11 news release announcing an upcoming appearance by Solomon, Laurie Norton Moffatt, the museum's director, called the book ‘a well-researched and written biography that presents many unique theories and interpretations about the artist.’ In a statement provided to the Berkshire Eagle, the museum said it was a center for academic freedom and for scholarship about Rockwell's life and that American Mirror was one in a long line of books about the artist. Author Solomon accuses Rockwell of being gay, even though he was married three times including to Miss Mary Rhoades . Many of the reviews of Deborah Solomon's American Mirror The Life And Art Of Norman Rockwell have accepted her account of his life and work. Her account is essentially wrong. She has neglected or misused the sources which she cites. Her use of Norman Rockwell's autobiography, My Adventures As An Illustrator, is highly selective. As Professor Patrick Toner of Wake Forest University states in his online review on First Things.com, ‘Solomon has a pronounced tendency to either distort or simply ignore evidence to the contrary.’ Garrison Keillor states in today’s review (published in the New York Times on Dec 19), ‘She does seem awfully eager to find homoeroticism – poor Rockwell cannot go on a fishing trip without his biographer finding sexual overtones.’ Keillor comments on Solomon’s suggestion that the doll in Girl At Mirror could be masturbating, ‘Well, I suppose that Michelangelo’s David could “almost” be masturbating’. On page 94 of her book, Solomon describes how Rockwell would ‘hang about the schools at recess . . and stop little boys on the street . .’ She then comments, ‘Today with our awareness of pederasty scandals (meaning pedophilia) this kind of behavior might seem problematic . .’ She then omits a passage just below this in the Autobiography that fully explains what really happened – after Rockwell would convince a boy to pose, they would go to ask the mother's permission. On page 101 she comments on his relationship with his models: ‘The integrity of the boys was never in question. But his own character was not nearly so straightforward.’ Referring to Nabokov's novel, Lolita, Solomon writes, ‘In a way Rockwell was Humbert Humbert’s discreet and careful twin brother, roused by the beauty of children but (thankfully) more repressed.’ Many of the reviewers have ignored the claim of pedophilia, perhaps because the suggestion of it blows the credibility of the book out of the water. The Tattoo Artist by Norman Rockwell: Solomon now claims that sex is only a 'tiny part' of her book . She supports this unfounded claim with another phantom theory, that Rockwell was a closeted homosexual. To link pedophilia and homosexuality in this way is offensive and clearly homophobic. We have found at least 68 of these sexual references throughout the book. On page 168 she comments on his search for costumes for his models: ‘. . . he did enjoy acquiring clothing from men who caught his eye, as if it were possible to acquire the less tangible parts of them as well.’ Solomon now claims that sex is only a ‘tiny part’ of her book. But sex is a major theme of the book and her phantom theories color and distort everything, including Rockwell’s entire character and her interpretations of his art. There is no way to separate her sexual theories from the rest of the book. Her take on Freedom of Speech is that the man standing is ‘unattached and sexually available. Unbuttoned and unzipped.’ Solomon also omits from the Autobiography many accounts of Norman Rockwell's feelings and relationships with women. There are also many other factual errors and omissions - we have found at least 96. Again, this is something that few reviewers seem to notice - they simply do not know enough about Norman Rockwell's life, and are too dependent on Solomon's flawed account. She inadequately interviewed Rockwell's three sons and therefore her account of his life is often inaccurate. She gives an incomplete account of a significant difficulty with the Post when the art editor, Ken Stuart, painted out a horse from one of NR's covers without consulting him. Solomon omits Norman Rockwell’s difficulties when his abilities were failing - in one instance he painted portraits of the Ross Perot family and they were so badly done that Mr. Perot sent them back and NR returned his check. Most important of all, Solomon doesn't understand the man, who Norman Rockwell was as a person. She says ‘On most days he was lonesome and loveless.’ This is absurd. He did not mope, was not a chronic depressive, or a hypochondriac. He went through his trials and storms as we all do, but he was someone who ultimately affirmed life. People liked Rockwell and enjoyed being with him. He was interested in people and what they had to say. On a personal note, I always had a wonderful relationship with my father, we were especially close when I helped him with his Autobiography. Solomon claims that her book is based on an examination of his art and that Norman Rockwell painted mostly men and boys. We counted all the Post covers from 1916 - 1951 and all the early covers for Life and Literary Digest. There are 172 covers with girls and women, and 141 covers with boys and men. Her theory is demonstrably wrong. Norman Rockwell also did 9 covers of Santa Claus. We're not sure in which category Solomon would place Santa. We are troubled and mystified that the Norman Rockwell Museum at Stockbridge has endorsed the book. This is our last word, we are no longer going to participate in the drama Solomon has created. This book says a lot more about Deborah Solomon than it does about Norman Rockwell.

"The Obama administration released an outline of its fiscal 2014 budget today promising that the president's budget 'reduces the deficit and puts the Nation on a sound fiscal course.' 'Every new initiative in the plan is fully paid for, so they do not add a single dime to the deficit,' the White House pledges. An initial walk through the budget proposals released overnight to reporters, however, suggests that Republicans in Congress will need some convincing. The budget will hit congressional offices less than 24 hours after the government's top watchdog agency declared that nearly $100 billion was wasted last year in duplicative and overlapping programs stretching into every corner of the Washington bureaucracy. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Defense: Obama on Wednesday defended his budget, saying, 'when it comes to deficit reduction, I've already met Republicans more than halfway.' Seeing things differently: House Speaker John Boehner won't like what President Barack Obama has to say about the federal budget on Wednesday . The star attraction of Tuesday's Capitol Hill hearing on the subject was the tale of three separate government agencies that spend money inspecting catfish, and the annual waste of $14 million that goes along with it. House Republicans in the oversight committee hearing room were not amused. And GOP budget hawks won't be smiling when they read a prominent declaration in the White House's outline that has already been shown to be an exaggeration. The budget, it says, 'would achieve $1.8 trillion in additional deficit reduction over the next 10 years, bringing total deficit reduction to $4.3 trillion. This represents more than enough deficit reduction to replace the cuts required by the Joint Committee [on] sequestration.' The implication, one which the White House has made more deliberately in the past, is that Barack Obama has already squeezed $2.5 trillion out of the government's next ten deficit statements. Obama himself said during a press conference on January 14 that he had signed bills into law that contained 'a total of about $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction over the past two years.' FactCheck.org, a program of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Policy Center, reported in February that Obama's total sum included about $600 billion, however, in new taxes - not spending reductions. It also included $500 billion in reductions of the amount the federal government planned to pay in future interest on its debts. Only about $1.4 trillion consisted of actual spending cuts - or at least what Washington wonks call spending cuts. President George W. Bush's 2004 fiscal year federal budget was a funding request to Congress that totaled $2.3 trillion. This year the government in Washington is on pace to spend $3.8 trillion, or more than 25 per cent of the value of the entire country's Gross Domestic Product . Obama on Wednesday defended his budget, saying, 'when it comes to deficit reduction, I've already met Republicans more than halfway.' 'The numbers work. There’s not a lot of smoke and mirrors in here,' he said in announcing the budget plan from the White House Rose Garden. 'Our economy is poised for progress, as long as Washington doesn’t get in the way,' he added, calling the budget a 'fiscally responsible blueprint for middle-class jobs and growth.' Federal budgets are configured along what's called a 'baseline,' providing a predetermined level of year-on-year increases that Congress has set on auto-pilot, and with which the White House generally considers it unwise to interfere. The $1.4 trillion in cuts were merely reductions in those planned rates of spending increases. The Daily Caller quoted House Speaker John Boehner's press secretary, Brendan Buck, who dismissed in an email the idea that the White House's budget will actually trim spending. 'So where are the net spending cuts? I guess they don’t exist,' Buck wrote. 'The president's budget will – at best – be flat on spending - or potentially even be a net spending increase [and] any deficit reduction will come exclusively from tax hikes.' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell practically begged the White House on Tuesday to get serious. 'Mr. President, if you are ready to embrace bold reform — to take the steps that are needed to make our entitlement programs permanently solvent and grow the economy — then Republicans are ready to work with you,' McConnell said. 'The time has come to summon the political courage to move beyond the status quo, to put the tax hikes and the poll-tested gimmicks aside, and to do what must be done.' Not bosom buddies: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnel (L) and Majority Leader Harry Reid (R) will have very different takes on Obama's budget. Reid, a Democrat, controls the Senate floor. McConnell, the Senate's leading Republican, will organize the opposition . Estimates like the one included in the White House's budget preview are prepared by the Office of Management and Budget, which has habitually included projected savings from the Obamacare health care law in its reports. The $1.8 trillion in new savings promised by the Obama White House in Tuesday's embargoed outline include '$400 billion in health savings that build on the health reform law.' But Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius conceded on March 26 that many Americans' health care premiums will increase under the new law, an indication that participation rates may not be at the level the administration wants to see. 'These folks will be moving into a really fully insured product for the first time,' the Wall Street Journal quoted Sebelius saying, 'and so there may be a higher cost associated with getting into that market.' She admitted Tuesday for the first time that the administration also greatly underestimated the complexity of the 2,700-page law and its accompanying 17,000 pages of regulatory instructions. That's an indication that future Obamacare reports may feature spending overruns - not savings - as the viability of health care exchanges, the administration's silver-bullet marketplaces that are supposed to drive costs down, are challenged by dozens of state governments that don't want to participate. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, once Obamacare's biggest cheerleader, may be its newest skeptic. She said Tuesday that the administration wasn't prepared for how complex the law's implementation would become . Another $580 billion of the newly promised $1.8 trillion in savings comes from tax increases on upper-income earners, a feature that will make the budget contentious, if not 'dead on arrival,' in the House of Representatives. The White House characterized it as 'additional revenue relative to the end-of-year tax deal, from tax reform that closes tax loopholes and reduces tax benefits for those who need them least.' House Republicans, though, may see the prominence of that mention - it comes first on the White House's list - as a thumbed nose, or a veiled threat of more tax increase demands to come. The larger problem for the White House is that Obama's promise of $580 billion in new tax revenues over ten years isn't nearly large enough to cover the spending bloat that Washington insiders continue to acknowledge as a crippling force. The public debt now stands at roughly $17 trillion, up $6 trillion from the debt when Obama took office in 2009. Even if the federal government takes ten years to rack up its next $6 trillion in accumulated deficits, the new taxes would contain less than 10 percent of the damage. The budget's most controversial feature may be the adoption of what economists call the 'Chained Consumer Price Index' measure of inflation, and what the administration referred to as 'using a chained measure of inflation for cost-of-living adjustments.' The chained CPI signals a shift in how the federal government will calculate everything from Social Security payouts and congressional pensions to college students' Pell Grants and veterans' benefits. Anything tied to cost-of-living increases would be subject to a new formula. White House press secretary Jay Carney has conceded that indexing cost-of-living increases to what economists call the ""Chained CPI"" would create a new tax burden for middle-class Americans . The White House's budget blueprint suggests that these programs would see $230 billion in costs savings over 10 years. The Congressional Budget Office puts the number at $216 billion. The CBO also notes, however - and the White House omits - that a switch to the chained CPI will also raise more than $124 billion in new tax revenues. The money will come pouring in because the consumer price index also controls income tax brackets, tax filers' standard deductions, nontaxable contribution limits for 401(k) retirement plans, and more. So millions of individual Americans will see themselves moved involuntarily to higher tax brackets, and middle-class taxpayers in particular will lose some of the tax credits and deductions that they count on. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney conceded as much during an April 5 briefing, when CBS News Chief White House Correspondent Major Garrett asked if it would 'raise taxes on middle-income Americans.' 'I'm not disputing that,' Carney said, adding that 'it is not the president's ideal policy.' It will, however, be part of his budget. This crucial excerpt from the president's 6-page budget outline, distributed to reporters Tuesday under a strict embargo order, shows how the Obama administration proposes to create new cost savings over the next ten years . Liberal activists have taken issue with the chained CPI in recent weeks, turning up by the hundred in front of the White House to protest what they predict will be Social Security and Medicare cuts related to the government's new cost-of-living math. The prospect of a middle-class tax hike will mobilize conservatives. The resulting discord may give Obama enough cover to proceed with some other elements of his budget, including $50 billion in new stimulus spending on roads, transit systems and other public works projects. Also expected is a tax increase on tobacco that would fund a new program of universally available preschool. The Washington Post reported Tuesday morning that the budget will include $235 million in new mental health spending, aimed at helping schools prevent the next Newtown, Connecticut-style gun massacre. And White House leak to CNN Tuesday night indicates at least one potential victory lap for which the administration is already preparing. Those extra catfish inspectors? They'll be gone, an unnamed official told the news network.","White House promises $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction, although similar previous claims have been debunked .

"Forget the Shard, the latest plans for a skyscraper in London would not only give fantastic views of the city but these views could change every hour and a half because the building rotates. An Italian architect has revealed the ambitious plans to create Dynamic Towers in cities around the world with separate floors that spin 360 degrees around a concrete centre every 90 minutes. The first two are planned to be built in Dubai and Moscow with other . cities including London, Milan, Paris, Rome, New York and Miami  on . the cards too. An Italian architect has designed a series of rotating skyscrapers for cities including London, Paris, Dubai and Moscow. Each floor is made of apartments that spin around a concrete centre once every 90 minutes . The brainchild behind the plans is Dr David Fisher from Florence who owns the Rotating Tower Technology Company. He said he was inspired to create the perpetual motion skyscrapers after soaking in the view from a friend's apartment in Manhattan. On his website he claims it is a new era for architecture: 'For the first time ever, buildings will be able to become part of life. 'Buildings will have four dimensions, adding the dimension of 'time''. Each of the Dynamic Towers are also designed to be self-sustaining and can generate electricity from wind and solar power. Up to 79 wind turbines will be fitted to each floor to generate enough energy to fuel the building's electricity. Fisher also claims that the buildings will be able to identify changes in climate and temperature and regulate energy through the building's surface. Towers are planned for Moscow, pictured, as well as London, Dubai, Paris, Milan and New York. The 'intelligent' buildings will also be able to manage the internal temperature of rooms automatically - making it cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter, for example . The 'intelligent' building can manage the internal temperature of rooms automatically - making it cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter, for example. By controlling this automatically Fisher claims it can ensure 'indoor comfort while reducing energy consumption.' Plans for the Dynamic Towers were first unveiled in 2008 with a start date of 2010. Delays in planning permission and structural design tweaks are said to have pushed this back . 'Over the next two decades our energy infrastructure will undergo changes . similar to those which rippled through the media and telecommunication . industries over the past twenty years. 'Just like the cell phone . revolution of the early 1990s, when the first generation wireless . telecommunications quickly saturated the analog network, so too will . digitalization pervade the purchase, generation, transportation and . usage of all sorts of energy.' Dr. Fisher's Rotating Tower project is innovative in design and architecture, but also recognizes environmental care and industrial production process as key points in the city of the future. The plans were released in 2008 and Fisher planned to have the first building in Dubai completed by 2010. However, delays in planning permission as well as structural design tweaks and problems with how the plumbing would work, for example, is said to have pushed this date back. Although, Dr Fisher believes each floor will only take six days to assemble around the core once permission is granted and the concrete structures are in place. Each of the towers have been designed with swimming pools, gardens and even lifts for cars meaning people can park outside their flats. The 80-storey Dubai tower is expected to cost around £355million while the 70-storey Moscow tower will be developed by the Mirax Group with final costs unknown. Details of the other towers have not been released and specific details about planning permission for all of the towers as well as expected start and completion dates have not yet been announced. Fisher previously said that he did not want to unveil too much information because he wanted it to be kept a 'surprise.'","Each Dynamic Tower has individual floors that rotate at different speeds .

"Comet Lovejoy, which recently survived a ‘graze’ with the Sun, has been captured on camera in spectacular fashion by the commander of the International Space Station. Dan Burbank saw the comet from a magnificent vantage point – 240 miles above the Earth’s horizon. He described seeing the comet as ‘the most amazing thing I have ever seen in space’ in an interview with WDIV-TV in Detroit. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Heavens above: Comet Lovejoy is visible near Earth's horizon in this nighttime image photographed by Dan Burbank . Star-struck: Burbank described the view as the most amazing thing he'd ever seen in space . Comet Lovejoy last week astonished star gazers by surviving a hellishly hot encounter with the Sun. The 660-foot-wide icy rock disappeared around the back side of the Sun, coming within 87,000 miles of its surface, and emerged triumphantly out the other side. This was the comet that lived. Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory caught the great escape on camera. After the dramatic event it tweeted: ‘Breaking News! Lovejoy lives! The comet Lovejoy has survived its journey around the sun to reemerge on the other side.’ Lovejoy was only discovered on November 27 this year and was named after the amateur Australian astronomer who spotted it, Terry Lovejoy. Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory captured Comet Lovejoy diving past the sun just 87,000 miles from the surface - and surviving the 'graze' Heat is on: Lovejoy emerges from the clutches of the Sun and was spotted escaping by Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory . It is classed as a ‘Kreutz sungrazer’, which is a class of comet whose orbit comes very close to the Sun. They are named after the 19th-century German astronomer Heinrich Kreutz, who figured out that they are actually the remains of one huge comet that broke apart. Soon after Lovejoy was found three separate space agencies excitedly began tracking its trajectory – Nasa, the European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Its fate was quickly marked as doomed because it would rush headlong into the Sun’s hellish corona. Writing on the Sungrazing Comets website, Naval Research Laboratory scientist Karl Battams said: ‘We have here an exceptionally rare opportunity to observe the complete vaporization of a relatively large comet, and we have approximately 18 instruments on five different satellites that are trying to do just that.’ Team effort: This map illustrates how countries from all over the world contribute to the running of the International Space Station . However, Lovejoy had other ideas and in a brief, but very clear, clip can be seen zooming away to safety from the Sun’s fiery clutches. Robert Massey, from the Royal Astronomical Society, was stunned by Lovejoy's close encounter. He told MailOnline: ‘It was an extraordinary event. Lovejoy was incredibly close to the Sun, closer to the Sun than the Earth is to the Moon. ‘And it’s certainly a pretty rare event. The Solar Heliospheric Observatory [Note: the video is from the Solar Dynamics Observatory] has seen many examples of comets being destroyed as they approached the Sun and there was a great deal of interest in this because there was an expectation of spectacular debris. ‘I suppose if something is big and tough enough it will survive. This event tells us that the comet was rather more robust than expected. Doubtless it had a very rough ride though!’ Mr Massey explained that comets have probably survived skirmishes with the Sun before, but we just haven’t been able to see them. ‘It just shows how good the technology is now,’ he added.","Last week Lovejoy came within 87,000 miles of the Sun's 5700C surface ."
"Cambridge University staff have been accused of severely mistreating sheep used in its laboratories after undercover video footage emerged from the facility. The university is now investigating the claims that the sheep, which are used for medical research, experienced distressing levels of mistreatment and suffering. Several incidents have allegedly been caught on camera, including footage which show staff losing patience with an animal during a weigh in, and the sheep suffering a broken leg. Scroll down for video . Hidden cameras: Sheep used in medical studies by Cambridge University had electrodes implanted into their brains and were left disorientated, struggling to walk and losing their sight . Animals are used to study neurological disorders, despite animal welfare groups claiming that the experiments are 'pointless' due to the difference between the brains of humans and sheep. The sheep kept at Cambridge University's facilities are imported from New Zealand and are given brain implants before they undergo behavioural tests and are monitored as their condition deteriorate, the report says. The sheep were left disorientated, struggling to walk and losing their sight before they died or were put to sleep, according to the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV), which conducted the undercover investigation. Their footage also expose a number of incidents that were said to have increased the misery still further, including one animal suffering a broken leg after an impatient staff member tried to force her into a cage for weighing. The sheep had to be put down after the incident. Undercover: The sheep's situation was filmed by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, and the university is now investigating the animal welfare organisation's claims . 'Mistreated': Some of the sheep are given brain implants before they undergo behavioural tests and are monitored as their condition deteriorate . Another sheep named Jane had to be killed because she had a faulty implant, while a third animal, Janet, suffered severe weight loss and became virtually blind. She was allegedly left in this state for several days, lying in her own faeces, before being euthanized. The purpose of the experiments was to investigate the early stages of Batten’s Disease and Huntington’s Disease, two serious neurological conditions for which there is no cure. Animal research is regulated by the Home Office, which applies rules intended to ensure that it is only carried out when necessary and suffering is kept to a minimum. Dr Katy Taylor, the BUAV’s head of science, said: ‘It is clear from our investigation that these poor animals suffered a great deal and, we believe, unnecessarily. 'This shows why undercover investigations are essential to reveal the extent of cruelty and suffering animals endure in UK research laboratories, often for trivial purposes or highly speculative science.' Accusations: Several incidents allegedly saw maltreatment of the animals, including sheep suffering broken legs, or other injuries as a result of the implants and having to be put down . Dr Taylor added: ‘There are serious questions about whether the research has any realistic prospect of advancing the search for cures for these diseases and about the way in which the Home Office has applied the harm/benefit test required under UK legislation before allowing such research to go ahead.’ A statement from Cambridge University said sheep were used in the studies because they had ‘complex brains’ similar in size to a large monkey’s, and no alternative existed. The statement added: ‘The researchers have been testing a sheep model of Huntington’s Disease developed by collaborators in New Zealand and Australia and studying a line of sheep that carries a natural mutation for Batten’s Disease. ‘Whilst every attempt is made to keep distress to a minimum, the very nature of these diseases means that the animals will show symptoms related to damage of the nervous system similar to those seen in humans. ‘We take the allegations of mistreatment of animals very seriously and will take all appropriate actions necessary to investigate this matter in accordance with the university’s responsibilities under our Home Office licence and our own Animal Welfare Ethical Review Committee.’","Sheep were used to study neurological disorders at Cambridge .

"A tourist has captured footage of sand sharks circling a popular pier at South Carolina's Surfside Beach to eat bait thrown in by fishermen. North Carolina natives Matt and Dana Rice were visiting Surfside Beach – a popular fishing destination along South Carolina’s Grand Strand – with their family, when tourists spotted anglers throwing leftover bait into the water. The video, which was taken just 150 feet off the shores of the beach, shows the sharks scrambling for the fish being thrown in by local fishermen. Tourists have recorded shocking footage in South Carolina of sand sharks circling just 150 feet off shore . You can also hear several children’s voices in the background, counting the sharks as they surface. According to local television stations WBTW, Surfside Beach visitor Erik Miller was shaken after seeing the video, which has now amassed over 350,000 views on Facebook. ‘Those are huge sharks,’ he told WBTW. ‘They could easily take your leg off or swallow a child.’ Though the appearance of the animals was surprising to tourists, local fisherman on the pier said that it’s quite a usual occurrence. ‘Sometimes you’ll see ten at a time come up circling the bait,’ a local called Brad Simpson said. As someone who fishes at the pier three days per week, he also said that the number of sharks in the area have decreased the likelihood of a successful catch. The video was filmed on Surfside Pier, which is very close to a popular tourist beach along the Grand Strand . However, the sand sharks aren't of particular concern for humans, insists a local Professor of Marine Science . ‘If you get a nice fish on and try to bring him in, a shark will usually get him,’ Simpson said. However, Professor of Marine Science at Coastal Carolina University, Dan Abel insists that there is no need for concern. Sand sharks, while intimidating looking, are not dangerous and shouldn’t be in the area for too much longer before they migrate South for winter. ‘They’ll be here a while longer,’ Abel told WBTW. ‘But when the day length starts to get shorter and the temperature drops below 70 degrees in the water they’ll start moving South and maybe a little more off shore.’ However, the Grand Strand does have some species that stay year round and Abel admits that the popular area can make for good shark habitat. Since it’s difficult to identify the various breeds in the murky water, he advises those who do see a shark to stay out of the ocean.","Sand sharks in South Carolina cause concern as feeding video goes viral .

"A salacious Twitter feed where Northwest high school students confess to lewd behavior is raising more than a few eyebrows, but the students behind it say parents are missing the point. @ClarkFession is filled with tales of taking drugs and having sex at school and for money, illicit contact with teachers, large groups and even ranks Clark County (WA) schools on how debaucherous they are. Students say it’s just harmless fun, but parents and school officials unable to stem the sex tide are concerned they don’t understand the implications of sharing their private lives online. Submissions to the feed's admin are made through various channels including other social media sites, everything remains anonymous. One of many: Skyview High School, in Vancouver, Washington, is one of more than a dozen schools named in Clark County - it is just across the Comubia River from Portland, Oregon . Group sex: Students post often of their group sex exploits - including losing their virginity in an orgy . Sex with teachers: Tales of lewd behavior weren't just limited to students . ‘It's like the news of the school right now,’ a high school senior told KGW. ‘Teenagers use it as a way to give out their dirty little secrets.’ Graphic tweets tell of group sex, provide details of bad sexual experiences and even tell of sex with teachers. ‘All the parties in this town turn into orgies, that’s why everyone has f****d everyone.’ The shocking account seems almost too far out there to be true, and perhaps some of the tweets are, but recent reports of lewd contact make the following tweets seem increasingly likely. ‘I’ve kissed one of our high school teachers,’ a La Center student wrote. ‘Tried to get with my teacher again and she said no more [because] Clarkfessions is making admin investigate that kind of stuff. Pissed,’ wrote another student. ‘Everyone just assumes [I’m] a virgin. But [I’m] probably one of the dirtiest girls at my school,’ another boasted. Retribution: This student accuses a middle school teacher of reacting to spurned sexual advances . The cheater: This student cheats 'on everything' The undercover: This girl brags about having a good reputation despite her supposed promiscuosity . Promiscuity isn’t limited just to students. ‘My mom f****d my History teacher, just for me to get a passing grade, a Skyview student wrote. Another parent is apparently dating a teacher after a similar incident, according to a separate tweet. ‘Been having sex with my friends (sic) mom for a year now,’ wrote a Prairie student. A Pacific Middle School student accused a teacher of retributions for denying sexual advances. ‘My teacher failed me because I refused to have sex with him.’ Other students confessed to having sex in bathrooms, classrooms, locker rooms, sports fields and baseball dugouts. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree: Some students told of their parents having sex with teachers for better grades . The same teacher: More than one parent supposedly slept with a teacher at one school . The first time: This student brags about losing their virginity while having group sex . Some admitted to sleeping with several . members of the football of soccer team, others to sleeping with multiple . brothers in one night. Several admitted to routinely having group sex, and more than one admitted to losing their virginity with people whose names they can’t remember or while engaging in sex acts with multiple or several people. One girl even bragged about a raging drug habit she carries on seemingly under the noses of school officials. ‘I snort coke in the girl’s bathroom pretty much everyday (sic).’ The account also rates schools in a top 10 list based on how 'ratchet' they are - which means how promiscuous girls at each school are. Those very same officials admitted to KING 5 they are powerless to stop the posts and can only monitor them for signs of bullying. An Evergreen School District spokesperson told Fox 12 that students do not have access to Twitter from the school’s network, and many other districts echoed those remarks in multiple reports. Drug use: This girl flaunts her alleged coke habit in the faces of school administrators . More group sex: Many student brag about sex with several partners . Sex with forbidden partners: Others bragged about having sex with people vastly older or younger than them . The most heartbreaking of all the tweets are the ones where young girls admit to prostituting themselves. ‘I use sex so guys will buy me things. I've gotten Dutch Bros, alcohol, food, and a t-shirt in return for putting out,’ a Hudson's Bay student tweeted. 'Dutch Bros' is a chain of West Coast coffee shops. ‘Bopped 3 guys in the junior lot in the same day for 15 dollars each,’ another student admitted. ‘Bopped’ is slang for giving oral sex. A Columbia River student wrote they ‘f****d a 64-year-old for $150 and a new outfit.’ Many male students admitted to sex or sex acts with other males, but insisted they weren’t gay. One told of how they contracted an STD after performing oral sex on a camping trip and lied to their mother saying it was a cut lip. Reckless: This girl supposedly has sex with guys so they buy her things - including cigars to smoke marijuana and liquor . Prostitution too: Multiple girls admitted to exchanging sex for money . More sex for money: This student admits to taking money in exchange for oral sex . Most students seem unconcerned with the Twitter feed because it is anonymous, and even questioned its authenticity. ‘""If it was more of people adding names [it would be a] bigger deal like past websites we've had,’ a Hudson High School junior told Fox 12. ‘Now that people post things that are anonymous, you can't even tell if they are true or not.’ ‘I'm sure some of them are true,’ a Hudson High School junior added. ‘But maybe people make things up to get retweets and favorites, people will do anything to do that.’ Experts are worried by the students’ lack of concern over the seemingly degrading posts. Behind her back: This guy admits having sex with 'multiple boys' while in a relationship with a girl but insists he is 'not gay' No limits: Students brag about sex with teachers, parents and friends of friends . That time an STD happened: One student contracted herpes after a camping trip . ‘They are thinking about what's happening now, they aren't thinking of the implications.’ Debbie Tschirgi, director of the Digital Learning Services program at a Portland-area school told KGW. ‘It's all about them being anonymous. Teenagers can write whatever they want to write without being identified especially in a situation like this on the Twitter account where they can say something and don't have their name published. ‘That's not uncommon,’ she continued. ‘That makes them all the more brave.’ The feed’s founder remain undeterred and have posted links to media coverage of their handiwork. They also vigorously defend it, saying parents need to worry more about what their individual children are doing than what a Twitter feed says. A request for comment from the feed’s founders and from a Twitter spokesperson was not immediately returned.","The feed brags about sex among students, teachers and parents in a suburb of Portland, Oregon .

"Ex-partners, work colleagues and neighbours are among hundreds of people tipping off the authorities about suspected tax dodgers every day. The number of informants telling the taxman about suspected dodgy practices has risen by thousands in two years, with an average of 250 people calling a HM Revenue & Customs hotline every day. Informants who tip-off HMRC can receive payouts of up to £1,000 if their information leads to a 'big win' over a wealthy individual. Ex-partners and work colleagues are among hundreds of people tipping off the taxman about suspected tax dodging every day . According to figures obtained by the Sunday Telegraph, a record £400,000 was paid out to people who phoned the taxman's hotline as part of a rewards scheme. Bitter ex-wives and husbands and disgruntled colleagues made up the majority of people phoning up to report tax evasion. Rewards of anywhere between £50 and £1,000 are given to informants whose phone call leads to HMRC recouping money from wealthy people. More than 97,000 people called the hotline last year, but only a small number of those were paid out, according to figures revealed under freedom of information laws. The amount paid out - £402,160 - was 30 per cent higher than three years ago. HMRC has taken 'desperate measures' to clamp down on tax dodging because of pressure from the Exchequer and its Chancellor George Osborne, experts say (file picture) Experts said this showed HMRC had taken to 'desperate measures' to claw back the £34billion in tax which has gone uncollected. Adam Craggs, a tax partner at law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain, said: 'The pressure on HMRC from the Exchequer means that it is turning to all available means in order to meet targets. 'It does not widely publicise the fact that it makes payments to informants partly because this is a controversial policy and also because it does not want to make payments unless it really has to. 'If too many people know that they can get paid by HMRC for providing information they may be less willing to provide information free.' The gap between tax owed and tax actually paid has grown by £1billion this year, with the Exchequer piling yet more pressure on the taxman. A spokesman for HMRC said making payments to informants was 'appropriate in certain occasions to tackle those who try to cheat the system'. He added: 'The payment of rewards is at the discretion of HMRC. The awards are based on what is achieved as a direct result of the information provided and a range of factors determine the amount. 'The factors include the tax recovered, the estimate of the loss of revenue prevented and other measurable benefits such as the time saved in working compliance cases.'","Hundreds of people tip-off the authorities on suspected tax dodging a day .

"This is the frightening moment a three-metre Great White started trailing a surfer back to shore, just two weeks before another man lost his arm and hand in a nearby shark attack. Andy Johnston was out with a small group of surfers at West Beach near Esperance, south-east of Perth, on September 21 when people ashore spotted the dark shadow looming. Other surfers managed to clear the water onto a reef after people started to honk their car horns to warn of the approaching shark, but Mr Johnston opted to stay put. Andy Johnston was out with a small group of surfers at West Beach near Esperance, south-east of Perth, on September 21 when people ashore spotted the dark shadow looming . 'I'd rather try to hold my ground against it and not freak out and make a commotion,' he told the Esperance Express following his close encounter. 'If you're going to get chomped then you're going to get chomped - there's nothing you can do about it.' The photos showing just how close Mr Johnston came only emerged on Thursday - a month after his close encounter. Frits De Bruyn, who was on holiday in Western Australia at the time, was standing at a nearby lookout and managed to capture the drama. 'We were at a lookout and we saw a shadow in the water.  It became evident it was shark and everyone started shouting. There was about a dozen surfers and paddle boarders in the water,' Mr De Bruyn told Daily Mail Australia. 'He followed him to shore for a bit... he was only a body-length behind him. 'The surfer went straight back out a few minutes after the shark swam away.' Other surfers managed to clear the water after people started to honk their car horns to warn of the approaching shark, but Mr Johnston opted to stay put . The photos showing just how close Mr Johnston came only emerged on Thursday - a month after the close encounter . The un-fazed surfer said he didn't even think the shark posed a threat, but admits if things had gone badly it would have been traumatic for anyone who witnessed the attack. 'It seemed just curious and I didn't want to give it a reason to chase me so I tried to behave casually and keep an eye on it,' Andy Johnston said. 'But I didn't know it came up quite so close as I was paddling into the wave to come into the beach with the other lads. 'If you're going to say a shark is a threat every time you see one, well that's not true. 'They're doing their thing and we're doing our thing. 'I probably have a higher risk of breaking my neck on that reef than the shark causing me harm.' While other surfers cleared the water, Andy Johnston remained still to 'not freak out and make a commotion' Two weeks after Mr Johnston's close encounter, Sean Pollard was attacked at nearby Wylie Bay, east of Esperance, on October 2. The 23-year-old lost his left forearm and his other hand at the wrist when he was mauled while surfing. Mr Pollard was dragged from the water where fellow beachgoers wrapped towels  around his bleeding injuries. He was rushed to Royal Perth Hospital. Soon after, two great white sharks were caught and killed drum lines were deployed Western Australia's Department of Fisheries. The dead sharks were taken to Perth for research and Mr Pollard's surfboard was being examined by experts.

"Number one exorcist: Father Gabriele Amorth, who claims to have carried out 160,000 exorcisms, is calling for all priests to be allowed to carry out the ritual . The Catholic Church's leading 'exorcist' is calling for all priests to be allowed to conduct the ritual after Pope Francis apparently performed one in St Peter's Square last week. Father Gabriele Amorth, head of the International Association of Exorcists, wants the current rules requiring all priests to obtain permission to perform exorcisms from their bishop to be relaxed. Father Amorth, who claims he has carried out 160,000 exorcisms, said his request has been prompted by Pope Francis performing an what he insists was an exorcism on a Mexican man 'possessed by four demons'. He told the Sunday Times: 'I will ask the pope to give all priests the power to carry out exorcisms, and to ensure priests are properly trained for these starting with the seminary. There's a huge demand for them.' His comments come after Pope Francis was captured on film performing an apparent exorcism on May 19. The footage shows Pope Francis placing his hands on the head of a disabled man who appears to go into a frenzy of convulsions and shaking, before slumping as Francis prays over him. Father Amorth, 88, told La Repubblica newspaper 'The Pope is also the Bishop of Rome, and like any bishop he is also an exorcist.' Those who dismiss exorcism as . superstition were wrong he insisted. ‘There was now, more than ever, a . need for exorcists to combat people possessed by ""sorcerers"" and . ""Satanists"".' The Pontiff was introduced to two men . in wheelchairs after Pentecostal mass on Sunday. When a priest leaned . across to tell Francis something, the Pope's expression took on a . serious tone. Francis then took hold of the top of . the man's head firmly, pushing him down into his wheelchair. As he . delivered an intense prayer, the man's mouth dropped open and he heaved . deeply half a dozen times, visibly shaking. Possessed: A priest leans in to talk to Pope Francis about a disabled man, pictured centre, who is allegedly 'possessed by four demons' following the mass in St Peter's Square . Exorcism? The Pontiff then places his hands on the man's head and prays intensely. Father Amorth insists the Pope was conducting a 'real and proper exorcism' on the disabled man . After the ritual Francis continued with his usual meetings with the sick who come to St Peter's. The Vatican downplayed the incident with spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said the Pope 'did not intend to . perform an exorcism' but a 'prayer for a suffering person'. But Father Amorth insists the 'prayer' was an exorcism ritual. He told the newspaper: 'The priest told Francis: ""Look, this is a young man who is possessed by the devil"". And the Pope blessed him and prayed over him, it was a real and proper exorcism. 'The Pope's exorcism is a splendid sign because one of the main causes of today's atheism is that people don't believe in the Devil any more. Jesus said: ""Who is not with me is with Satan"".' He added: 'We live in an age in which God has been forgotten. And wherever God is not present, the Devil rules. 'Today, unfortunately, bishops don't . appoint sufficient exorcists. We need many more. I hope that Rome will . send out directives to bishops around the world calling on them to . appoint more exorcists.' The former Pope, Benedict XVI, never . officially performed an exorcism but John Paul II is known to have . carried out at least three exorcisms during his tenure. Father Amorth claimed Pope John Paul II had been a powerful exorcist. He said: 'John Paul II fought many times against Satan. The man, who is in a wheelchair, is seen breathing deeply and then convulsing as the pope stands over him . Pope Francis then smiles again as he continues along the line of children waiting to meet him . 'Even though he is dead, he is still present today in many exorcisms. If you cite his name during an exorcism, the person who is possessed actually froths at the mouth in fury.' Father Amorth, who has held his post for 28 year, is known for his outspoken personality and has previously criticised both yoga and Harry Potter. He said:'Practising yoga brings evil as does reading Harry Potter. They may both seem innocuous but they both deal with magic and that leads to evil.' He added:'Yoga is the Devil's work. You think you are doing it for stretching your mind and body but it leads to Hinduism. All these oriental religions are based on the false belief of reincarnation.' Father Amorth, speaking on the subject of People And Religion at a fringe event at the Umbria Film Festival in Terni two years ago, went on to speak of his dislike for JK Rowling's young wizard. He said:'People think it is an innocuous book for children but it's about magic and that leads to evil. In Harry Potter the Devil is at work in a cunning and crafty way, he is using his extraordinary powers of magic and evil. 'Satan is always hidden and the thing he desires more than anything is for people to believe he does not exist. He studies each and everyone of us and our tendencies towards good and evil and then he tempts us. 'My advice to young people would be to watch out for nightclubs because the path is always the same: alcohol, sex, drugs and Satanic sects.' While in 2006, Father Amorth, who was ordained a priest in 1954, gave an interview to Vatican Radio in which he said that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and Russian dictator Josef Stalin were both possessed by the Devil.

"Silvio Berlusconi has defended the use of bribes in business saying they are necessary when securing international deals for Italian companies. The former Italian Prime minister said illegal payments are vital when negotiating with ‘third world countries and regimes’. Mr Berlusconi made the comments as a response to recent corruption scandals within several state-controlled conglomerates in Italy. No crime: Silvio Berlusconi, pictured during a political rally in Rome last week, defended the use of bribes in international negotiations saying they are 'necessary' when dealing with third world countries and regimes . Mr Berlusconi, spoke against the arrest of Giuseppe Orsi, CEO of Finmeccanica defence group, who . was taken into custody yesterday accused of paying Indian government . officials to secure a helicopter contract. The 76-year-old politician, who is . running for his fourth term as Prime Minister in the country’s elections . this month, said bribes are essential in international business, the Financial Times report. ‘Bribes are a phenomenon that exists . and it is useless to deny the existence of these necessary situations . when you are negotiating with third world countries and regimes,’ Mr . Berlusconi said in an interview with Italian State broadcaster, RAI 3. ‘These are not crimes. We are talking . about paying a commission to someone in that country. Why? Because those . are the rules in that country.’ Say a little prayer: Berlusconi, seen enjoying a Valentine's dinner with his fiance last night, as polls indicate he may not return to power in the elections later this month . The centre-right leader also defended . state-controlled energy group Eni, which is alleged to have used bribes . to win contracts in Algeria. Mr Berlusconi even went as far as to suggest that putting a stop to bribery has left Italian companies out of business. It's ok, I'm Italian: Berlusconi defended the use of bribes to secure deals for Italian companies . ‘No one will negotiate with Eni or Enel or Finmeccanica anymore,’ he said. ‘It’s pure masochism.' Mr Berlusconi called those who condemn financial incentives in deals outside Western democracies ‘absurd’. ‘If you want to make moralisms like that, you can’t be an entrepreneur on a global scale.’ His comments comes one year after his own bribery case was thrown out of court. Mr Berlusconi stood accused of handing . British lawyer David Mills £380,000 to lie during two 1990s trials to . shield Berlusconi and his Fininvest holding company from charges related . to the billionaire media mogul's business dealings. The Italian general elections will take place 24-25th February where Mr Berlusconi is yet again heading the People of Liberty party and hoping for a centre-right coalition. His comments were unsurprisingly slammed by opposition politicians, who pointed out that Mr Berlusconi himself is appealing against his October tax fraud conviction while running for Prime Minister. Just last month an Italian court granted his defense team's request to postpone a trial for alleged wire tapping until after the elections. Prosecutors have asked for a one-year jail sentence for Mr Berlusconi for his alleged role in the publication of wiretap transcripts in a newspaper owned by his media empire and three years for his brother Paolo, the publisher of Milan newspaper Il Giornale. Mr Berlusconi denies all charges.","Berlusconi defending bribes saying they are not criminal but 'necessary'

"Far from being detrimental to health, enjoying S&M may make people less neurotic and more outgoing . Some may think it is perverse, but enjoying the snap of the whip . or the clink of chains on skin could make you more psychologically healthy than those . who enjoy a more mundane sex life. A study found that BDSM - bondage, discipline, sadism and . masochism - enthusiasts scored better on a variety of personality and psychological tests . compared to those who did not have sexual fetishes. Experts say this is because those who enjoyed kinky sex were . more extroverted, more open to new experiences and less neurotic. Dr Andreas Wismeijer, a psychologist from Tilburg University, . found that  BDSM practitioners ‘either . did not differ from the general population and if they differed, they always . differed in the more favourable direction’. Dr Wismeijer and his fellow researchers asked BDSM fans to undergo . a variety of psychological questionnaires online. They also sought participants who did not do BDSM via a women's . magazine website, a personal secret website and a university website. Participants did not know what the surveys were about, other that . they concerned ‘human behaviour’. In total 902 BDSM . practitioners and 434 non-BDSM participants filled out questionnaires on . personality, sensitivity to rejection, style of attachment in relationships and happiness. The Dutch study also found that those who dominated in sex games were the most psychologically balanced. Those who were submissive were no less mentally balanced than the rest of the general population, however . The results revealed that on a basic level, BDSM practitioners are . no more troubled than the general population. In fact they were more outgoing, more open to new experiences and . more conscientious than less adventurous participants. They were also less neurotic, a personality trait marked by . anxiety. Enjoying the clink of chains in skin can be a sign that you are mentally balanced . BDSM aficionados also scored lower than the general public on . rejection sensitivity, a measure of how paranoid people are about others . disliking them. People in the BDSM scene reported higher levels of happiness in . the past two weeks than people outside it, and they said they felt more secure . in their relationships. Interestingly, the role a person played when engaging in BDSM . behaviour seemed to be linked to a person’s psychological profile. Dominants tended to be the most balanced, submissives . the least and switches (those who enjoy dominating and being dominated) were  in the middle. But submissives never scored lower than the general population on . mental health, and frequently scored higher. ‘Within the BDSM community, [submissives] were always perceived as . the most vulnerable, but still, there was not one finding in which the . submissives scored less favourably than the controls,’ Wismeijer told LiveScience. The findings were published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine.","Those who enjoy indulging in fetishes are psychologically healthier and happier than the general population, say Dutch researchers .
Experts believe this is because they are more outgoing and less neurotic .
Those who played the dominating role in sex games were deemed as the most mentally healthy and submissives the least .
But none of the S&M participants scored lower than the general population  in psychological tests ."
"Big beards are out and the clean shaven look is in, according to new figures on the booming sales of male shaving tools. Prickly hugs and kisses and embarrassing eating situations look set to be a thing of the past, as men ditch the caveman look and embrace their inner gentleman. The trend for well-groomed facial hair is on the rise, as Debenhams have reported a 24 per cent increase in sales of electrical grooming products such as high tech facial hair stylers and electric shavers. A clean shaven Ben Affleck embraces his sans-beard image at a film premiere last month (l) and a scruffier, bearded Affleck and Matt Damon on 25 Jan . Uplifts suggest that men have ditched the 'Hipster Beard' trend for a more clean-cut look. Bosses at the department store, which released the statistics, have attributed this increase to the clean shaven look sported by Hollywood actors such as Ben Affleck and George Clooney, who have both recently ditched their big beards in favour of a more refined and polished appearance. This bucks the big beards trend most recently sported by television presenter Jeremy Paxman, who caused a twitter storm after appearing on Newsnight back in August with a full grey beard. Sara Stern, Beauty Director at Debenhams said 'Men are seeking to replicate the well groomed look seen recently on a host of high profile celebrities by maintaining their facial hair and paying more attention to skincare. 'The recent launch of male and unisex make-up shows just how seriously men are taking their grooming habits.' Professor Karen Pine, a psychologist from the University of Hertfordshire, said: 'Humans are social animals and rely on subtle cues from facial expressions to understand each other. Jeremy Paxman caused a twitter storm after appearing on Newsnight back in August with a bushy beard . 'Too much facial hair can conceal the expressions, giving the impression that the man is inscrutable or has something to hide. 'Research does show that men with full beards are viewed as fatherly; it lends gravitas and tends to make them look older. 'But women find men with neatly-trimmed stubble or a clean-shaven look more attractive.' A recent survey conducted by the high street retailer confirms this switch with one in five UK males admitting to spending more than £100 per month to maintain their looks, the most popular products being soothing shave gels and luxurious post shave moisture balms. Three out of every five UK males also claimed to follow a daily skincare routine. Facial fuzz aficionado and . photographer Jonathan Daniel Pryce, who runs the hit blog 100 Beards 100 . Days, says: 'The research is interesting but I think it indicates a . more groomed beard rather than a removal of it,', . 'If . you look at any big male grooming brand they're releasing products for . grooming lengthy beards - very few are innovating in the wet shave . arena. Men are just not interested in a wet shave, clean look at the . moment.

'What we are seeing is merely the reemergence of manhood. Many corporations have put a lot of money into propagating the lie that shaving is the proper look of a man. 'Now that the truth has finally coming out beards are once again becoming popular and are gaining acceptance back into mainstream cultures throughout the world.'","Debenhams report 24 per cent rise in sales of electrical grooming products .

"Unbelievable footage taken from beneath a speeding boat in the Atlantic shows what getting attacked by a massive shark might be like. Thrill seekers off the Maryland coast trailed bait behind their sportsfishing boat and filmed the results with a high definition GoPro camera when a massive mako shark came looking for lunch. Crewman of the Pumpin’ Hard filmed near Ocean City in July. Now the squirm-inducing YouTube video has rack up an impressive 1.5 million views. See the video below... Perfect predator: The mako shark is one of nature's deadliest sea creatures. The beasts can weigh as much as 1,300 pounds and swim as fast as 22mph . The camera is set up facing the back of the boat and puts the viewer in the shoes of the baitfish trailing behind. A shadow can at first be seen as just a speck in the murky distance. Little by little the size of the beast becomes more clear. Then like a bolt of lightning, the creature reveals itself: a huge, hungry mako shark. These intimidating fish are found throughout the Mid-Atlantic and the largest specimens have been found to tip the scales at over 1,200 pounds.

No amateur: These aggressive feeders will attack if provoked and have the razor-like teeth to back up the bite . A record-breaking mako caught in the waters off Southern California measured 11 feet. Its exact size is unclear, but the video proves one thing—this mako was hungry. It snatches each fish trailing the boat one by one, then disappears. Each time, it creeps back into the view of the camera to snag another bite. Watching this stunning footage will make anyone relieved to be out of reach of these stealthy, deadly predators. Retreats: Time and again the menacing fish disappears after snagging a bite of fish from behind the boat . Only to return: But as soon as the mako is gone, it has swallowed its fish and returns for another massive bite .","Fishermen on the Maryland sportsfishing vessel Pumpin' Hard took the amazing footage from beneath the boat .

"If you’re trying to keep up with the Joneses, then there soon might be another must-have item to add to your dinner party woes. Because according to those in the know, the humble salt cellar is falling out of fashion thanks to its more modern replacement – grated Himalayan pink rock salt. Mined from Himalayan rock and supposedly the purest form of salt, the so-called ‘rivsalt’ is said to resemble a precious gemstone. Himalayan rock salt is said to be the purest form of the seasoning, and is being sold by Harvey Nichols with a stainless steel grater . It comes with a Japanese stainless steel grater and an engraved natural oak holder with a transparent lid – and will set you back £25. A spokesman for department store Harvey Nichols, which is stocking the product from next week, claimed it would give people a ‘unique and original dining experience’, adding: ‘The salt is turned into faceted rocks of various sizes and shades, from rosy pink to translucent white.’ Its creators hope it will become a common sight on tables across the country, and help transform the image of salt, which they feel has been dismissed as unhealthy and unfashionable. But the sales patter failed to impress health campaigners. Professor Graham MacGregor, chairman of Consensus Action on Salt and Health, said: ‘They are promoting something that is potentially dangerous for people’s health. ‘With grated salt, you end up with much larger crystals. Oddly enough, they taste less salty than fine grains so you keep adding more to your food and more salt is absorbed into your body. If you are going to eat salt, very fine crystals are better.’","Trendy seasoning comes with stainless steel grater and costs £25 .

"In court: Rachel Farrell, 26, pleaded guilty to the affair with an 11th grade pupil at Bangor Area High School in Pennsylvania . A former high school teacher who was charged with having sex with a 17-year-old student on 'numerous occasions' carried out the trysts in her car and in Ramada Inns, it has emerged. Rachel Farrell, 25, had only been married two months when the alleged sexual liaisons took place. She was teaching reading to the 11th grade pupil at Bangor Area High School in Pennsylvania. The 25-year-old later resigned and is also now divorced. She is charged with three counts of corrupting a minor. Police also believe she may have had sex with three other students. The teen, who is now 18, told police he and his teacher began communicating on Facebook and had sexual encounters with him 'numerous times at many different locations', including parking in secluded spots. Investigators said some of the encounters took place at a Walmart parking lot and twice at a Ramada Inn in Tannersville, . Monroe County. Scandal: Farrell resigned from her teaching post at Bangor Area High School and got divorced . Police said she confessed to colleagues at the school that she had sex with two 17-year-old students, later also . admitting it to county Detective Robert Righi. Farrell was married in June 2010. The . alleged affair is said to have taken place between August of the same . year and January 2011. Bangor . Area High School superintendent Patricia Mulroy said the district . confronted Farrell as soon it found out about the accusations against . her and that the matter was turned over to county prosecutors. Bangor Area High School is no stranger to controversy. A biology teacher fatally overdosed on heroin in 2009, while a male teacher's aide was jailed after admitting drug possession charges and of supplying drugs to students, one of whom went on to kill himself. In 2010, a nude photo of a female teacher's aide was circulated on students' mobile phones. Last week, elementary school teacher Shannon Alicia Schmieder was jailed for 40 years for having sex with a 14-year-old student.

"There's no denying Donald Trump is a big wig - but researchers have photographed a caterpillar that bears an uncanny resemblance to the property mogul's hair. With its brightly coloured, carefully parted 'do' the bizarre looking caterpillar has been compared to the U.S property mogul's unique look. The creature was spotted in the Amazon by friends Jeff Cremer, 34 and Phil Torres, 27, who run photography tours from Posada Amazonas, a 30 bed rainforest lodge in Peru. Scroll down for video . Nicknamed the 'Donald Trump Caterpillar', this creature is actually a flannel moth. They are found in Mexico, southern parts of the US, and some parts of central America. This one was found in the Amazon rainforest . Who wore it best? Donald Trump's iconic hairstyle bears an uncanny resemblance to the flannel moth . The official name of the flannel moth is Megalopyge opercularis. It's also known as a pussy moth, or puss caterpillar, because its hair-like setae resembles a tiny Persian cat. Like Donald Trump, it often has a streak of bright orange running through it. When the moth is in the early-stages of larvae the 'hair' is curly and cottony. The moth's hair is actually venomous spines and can cause skin irritations. Conservation biologist Phil and wildlife photographer Jeff were leading a small group of tourists on a recent tour when Phil spotted the insect on a leaf and was so struck by its fluffy mane he couldn't resist taking a photo. Jeff said 'On these tours we take tourists and photographers into the Amazon and point out cool and unusual things for them to photograph. 'We have been leading photo tours together for two years and have never seen anything as strange as this.' Phil, a seasoned field biologist, said 'I've seen some bizarre looking caterpillars in my time of working in the field but this was definitely the weirdest one I've ever seen. 'I wasn't sure what I was looking at at first, it was this big yellow fuzzy thing. This is the equivalent of the 'Donald Trump moth's' cocoon, however, the larva does not spin a cocoon in the conventional sense, instead the moth separates from its furry skin and uses it as a protective covering while it pupates . After the southern flannel moth has finished pupating and left its cocoon, it looks more like a bee than Donald Trump . Donald John Trump, Sr. is an American business magnate, TV personality and author. He was born June 14, 1946 and is the chairman and president of The Trump Organization. He has starred in the US version of Apprentice and came 14th on the 2012 Forbes Celebrity 100 list. Trump is nicknamed 'The Donald' after his first wife Ivana referred to him as such in a interview in 2008. In 2007 Trump appeared at WrestleMania 23 in Michigan with Bobby Lashley, who competed against Umaga and WWE Chairman McMahon. Whoever lost would had to shave their head. Luckily for the flannel moth Umaga lost and McMahon's head was shaved. 'It's actually a flannel moth caterpillar, they're really rare, I've seen this type of caterpillar before but never one of this colour. 'We put the picture of our Twitter and Facebook page and immediately people started comparing it to Donald Trump. 'We didn't see the resemblance when we first saw the caterpillar but looking at the photo it's certainly similar to his hair. 'It was pretty funny, people went mad for the photo comparing it to his toupee. 'I think if Donald saw it himself, he'd find a reason to come down and check the caterpillar out. 'It's not the most approachable of caterpillars either- if you touch that thing it would seriously hurt, it has these little hairs that can poke into your skin and release a venom. 'When we show people the image some don't even know what it is, some think it's a mammal others a bird or some have said a plant. 'But to us and most of the people who've seen it, it's Donald Trump's toupee - left on a leaf in the Amazon.""","'Donald Trump moth' found in Amazon rainforest .

"A San Francisco couple who subjected their tenants to a terrifying campaign of threats and terror in an effort to evict them have been sentenced to four and a half years in prison. For more than three years Kip and Nicole Macy stalked their tenants, threatened them with a semi-automatic weapon, changed the locks without telling them, and tried to have the windows boarded up while one tenant was still at home. The couple also tried to saw through a supporting beam in one of the Market district flats, but were stopped when the tenant, who was in, managed to bend the blade. Guilty: Kip and Nicole Macy were charged with burglary, stalking and grand theft after trying to evict tenants . The couple were found guilty of residential burglary, stalking and . attempted grand theft after their efforts to evict tenants from . a building in Clementina Street. 'The actions of these defendants are so . outlandish and brazen that it sounds like the plot line of a horror . movie,' San Francisco District Attorney George Gascón said, as he sentenced the couple on Wednesday. The campaign of terror began soon after the couple bought an apartment block for $995,000 in 2005 and tried to evict the five tenants already living in it. Within a year, the Macys were involved in litigation with Scott Morrow, one of the tenants. Mrs Macy, 37, set up a fake email account in Mr Morrow's name and sent a message to his lawyer saying his services were no longer needed, according to the Huffington Post. She then sent an email threatening to dismember the lawyer's children, in an effort to make Mr Morrow look unstable. A month later the couple had a hole cut through his floor with a power saw while Mr Morrow was at home, and had his electricity cut off. A beam was also cut through in the belief that the property would be deemed unsafe and the tenants would be forced to move out. Shocking: A tenant was at home when he realized a power saw was being used to cut a hole in his floor . Terror: Scott Morrow had successfully fought eviction when the Macys had a large hole cut in his floor . Despite repeated demands from building inspectors for the beam to be repaired, the Macys refused. Eventually the city paid for the $8,000 repairs and sent the couple the bill, which they have not paid. 'This is a very bizarre case,' deputy city attorney Jennifer Choi told SF Gate. 'It seemed like these landlords went from zero to extremely angry very quickly.' The attorney for two of the other tenants called the Macys 'lawless landlords'. The couple had changed the locks on the apartment leased to Erik Hernandez and Jason Lopez after they began paying a reduced rate because they were being overcharged under rent control law. After changing the locks, the Macys entered the apartment, dismantled furniture and stole $2,000, a Gucci watch and a phone. When Mr Hernandez came home to find Mr Macy, 38, in his home, the landlord kicked him in the chest, according to the law suite. Mrs Macy also broke into the apartment and poured ammonia on the tenants' clothes and furniture. 'I would say this is horrendous, a total abuse of tenants and human beings so they could have their way and totally ignore the law,' Mr Steve Collier said. The couple also threatened the building manager with a semi-automatic weapon and ordered the windows to one of the apartments to be boarded up while the tenant was still inside. Lisa Dewberry, Mr Macy's attorney, told ABC 7: 'He and his wife were naive when coming to a town like San Francisco, to try and do what they wanted to do, not realizing how tough the landlord tenant laws are here.' She added: 'They're not saying their behavior was appropriate, they regret their behavior.' Dangerous: The couple also had joists cut in the apartment building in their attempts to evict the tenants . Full house: When the Macys bought the apartment building in Clementina Street it already had five tenants . When the Macys were arrested in 2008 they posted bail and left the country. They were tracked down in Italy last year and brought back to the U.S. where bail was set at $2 million each. In a plea deal the couple will be jailed for four and half years, and will have two strikes against them under California's three strike rule. Mr Morrow, who sued the couple, declined to comment on the sentencing but Ms Choi said: 'This has been very traumatic for him. He literally never leaves his apartment because he thinks the Macys will change the locks.'","Power saw used to cut hole in apartment while renter was still at home .

"French officials face a race against time to dispose of a beached whale - before it explodes with potentially fatal consequences. The decaying 15-ton carcass has become so bloated with gas there is a high chance it could burst, wildlife experts have warned. Authorities are now desperately trying to work out the best way of getting rid of it - and may even blow it up with dynamite. Scroll down for video . Timebomb: French officials have been scratching their heads over how to dispose of this 15-ton beached whale which is at risk of exploding due to the build up of gas inside the animal . Risk: The decaying carcass has become so bloated with gas there is a high chance it could burst with potentially fatal consequences if anyone gets too close . The whale washed up on the beach at Saintes-Marie-de-la-Mer, near Montpellier on the Mediterranean coast . Road access to the whale has been blocked and the area cordoned off to prevent people approaching or touching it. Video from last year showing a whale exploding in similar circumstances showed just how dangerous - and potentially fatal - it could be. The whale washed up on the beach at Saintes-Marie-de-la-Mer, near Montpellier on the Mediterranean coast in early November. Anais Cheiron, project manager of the national reserve of Camargue, said: 'Because of the heat, gases form inside the cadaver – hence, the bulging appearance of the whale. 'They accumulate until they explode.' Easy does it: Marine biologist Bjarni Mikkelsen approaches a 45ft whale with an extra-long sharp knife in this video from last year after it washed up n a beach in the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic . Mr Mikkelsen tried to cut open the sperm whale carcass which exploded in his face in November 2013 . When an animal dies, bacteria inside the carcass produce methane as part of the decomposition process. If this is not let out of the body gradually it builds up, exploding at the first opportunity. Whales are the most extreme because their huge size makes the consequences of a gas build-up so much greater. Living toads in Hamburg, Germany, started spontaneously combusting in 2005. It was thought crows were picking out their livers, leaving a hole, so when the toads puffed themselves up as a defence mechanism, their whole bodies burst. And Royal funeral attendants hurriedly drilled a hole in the coffin of the overweight English king George IV to let out gases - after an apparent botched embalming job. The whale could be dragged out to sea and detonated using dynamite, he told daily newspaper Midi Libre, according to The Local. But he said boats may not be able to get close enough to tow it because of sand banks nearby. The other option would be to pop the carcass and cut it into pieces before loading it onto a van. Last year, the dangers of exploding whale carcasses were made all-too clear when a marine biologist was captured on gruesome video trying to cut one open - which exploded all over him. The sperm whale was one of two which died last November after beaching in the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic. The creatures died after becoming trapped in a narrow channel, and residents of the 50,000-strong Danish community wanted to use the skeleton of one for a museum. So it fell to unlucky Bjarni Mikkelsen, a marine biologist at the National Museum of the Faroe Islands, to cut open the carcass yesterday. He had never cut open a whale before so he approached the pungent 45ft corpse gingerly. As soon as he began working, the gas trapped inside exploded, spewing tons of organs and guts into the air. The main part of the huge blast just missed him. Organs: Mr Mikkelsen stands apparently stunned as the whale's insides fly into the air in front of him . Gruesome: By the time the worker on the Faroe Islands turned round to escape, it was too late . He told MailOnline: 'The animal was more than two days old when we took it so we knew there would be some pressure on the inside, but nothing like what happened. 'We couldn't imagine it would happen like that so it was a little bit more of a surprise. 'It wasn't a shock. We had expected something. In the situation I was more worried about something worse happening or anyone getting hurt. 'We were cutting along the dorsal part of the animal so when it exploded it did so in a very controlled way. 'It was very loud, I suppose. It's something everyone here is talking about.'","Carcass at risk of bursting on Mediterranean beach due to build-up of gas .

"Thousands of migrants living illegally in sheds and garages are to be flushed out by thermal images taken from the air. The photographs will reveal if heat is coming from the outbuildings, indicating that they are inhabited. Slough . Borough Council believes that up to 3,000 people are being housed in . the unsafe and primitive ‘sheds with beds’, which often lack heating or . running water. Illegal: Slough Council hopes to crackdown on rogue landlords turning sheds into illegal living accommodation, such as this conversion, pictured . UK first: A plane equipped with thermal imaging cameras will fly over the town of Slough, Berkshire, to track sheds being used to illegally house immigrants (computerised image) A plane fitted with state-of-the-art kit . will fly over the town as Slough becomes the first local authority in . the UK to use thermal imaging to clamp down on people living illegally . in outbuildings. It is not known exactly how many so-called 'sheds with beds' there are in Slough, but estimates range from 700 to 3,000. The council has warned that if the cameras detect where workers are living, their sheds may be bulldozed. The . council has commissioned geographic imaging company Bluesky . International to produce a thermal map of the town, which officers will . use to pin-point warm areas in outbuildings, indicating where humans may . be living. The plane will fly over the whole borough to collect the data as soon as the conditions are right.Ray . Haslam, the council's head of environmental services and resilience, . said: 'Our primary concern is making sure people are not living in . unsafe conditions, with little or no heating, or in places that do not . comply with building or fire safety regulations. Clampdown: Some of the illegal conversions are used to hide immigrants in poor and crowded living conditions . 'Aerial . photography is one of a range of tactics we're using to crack down on . this problem and we hope evidence of heat in outbuildings will help us . build a true picture of how many sheds are being lived in and where they . are. 'We will be able to cross-check and see . whether they have valid Energy Performance Certificates which are . required by law for places where people live. 'If they don't, we will be speaking to landlords and offering some advice and guidance, and enforcing the law if we need to. 'One . option is to repeatedly fine a landlord for not having an EPC. The fine . is £200 a day, making it very expensive for people to continue using . the outbuilding.' Forced . demolition of sheds with beds, although an option for the council, . particularly if a property is unsafe, is often a lengthy, costly . process. Other options for enforcement action . include returning sheds to their legal use, such as a garage or store . room, and in some cases granting permission for them to be used as a . home, meaning that landlords will then be required to pay council tax . and ensure they are energy and fire compliant. Growing problem: Slough Council estimates there are between 700 to 3,000 'beds in shed' in the town . Councillor James Swindlehurst, deputy . leader and commissioner for neighbourhoods and renewal, said: 'The . people living in them generate waste, they use council services and they . have a cost to the council that isn't being paid for by taxation. 'It causes pressure on parking and driveways and we get neighbourhood complaints about densely built gardens. 'Some of these buildings are . perfectly habitable but others are not compliant and we will take action . to amend their use or have them removed. 'The . buildings often have planning permission as something else, a store or a . garage, and then kitchens and things have arrived later. 'The first thing we try and do is obviously to return them to their permitted use. Cut backs: Slough Council says people living in these illegal conversions use council services but do not contribute any council tax towards them . Some of the buildings uncovered may be allowed to remain a dwelling but others will be demolished . 'In . some cases we can regularise them as a dwelling and levy council tax on . them and make sure they are energy and fire compliant. 'We let them exist but we make sure they are paying their share towards the cost of existing. 'In the worst cases we have to take the whole building down, demolish it and remove the people living in it.' The council is one of a handful of . local authorities which has been granted extra money from the Government . to help improve conditions in houses of multi-occupancy and reduce the . number of sheds being used as accommodation without permission. The occupants of sheds in Slough are believed to be mostly single adults or childless couples with low incomes. The thermal imaging cameras on the plane, stock image pictured, will be able to locate where people are living in the town by their body heat . Example: This thermogram image shows the sort of data a thermal imaging camera will capture by flying over slough . Long-term, it is hoped the thermal imaging data will also be used to improve energy efficiency in homes across the borough. Councillor Patricia O'Connor said: 'I think it is an outrage. I get so offended by it and I want to see the back of them. 'There are so many unscrupulous . landlords flouting the law in such a fashion and quite an epic scale, I . think we have to be incredibly robust in the way we deal with them. 'Somebody . told me in Brent they have actually knocked some of these sheds down . and that's the kind of approach I want to see in Slough. Councillor O'Connor said Slough, which has a large mixed-race population, risks becoming 'colonised with sheds with beds unless something is done about it'. Last August it was announced that Slough council had been given more than £200,000 to tackle rogue landlords who house people in converted sub-standard outbuildings. Last year it was announced that Slough Borough Council had been selected by government housing minister Grant Shapps in May for funding to 'flush out dodgy landlords' who are 'trapping vulnerable people' in converted sheds. The council is targeting key problem wards including Baylis and Stoke, Central and Chalvey and has employed an additional planning enforcement officer, a barrister to pursue legal action and has taken on a part-time administrator to co-ordinate and liaise with officers across five council departments. Mr Shapps said last year: 'I'm determined to flush out criminal landlords who think they can make an easy buck from cramped, cockroach-ridden outhouses. The scandal of 'beds in sheds' must come to an end.'","Slough council is the first to use the cameras to clampdown on 'landlords'

"Existing on a spartan diet of nuts, seeds, fruit and vegetables might not sound particularly appetising, but Susan Reynolds, 29, says it keeps her looking so young, she is regularly mistaken for a 16-year-old. Susan, who hails from Edinburgh, last ate cooked food seven years ago and now consumes nothing but uncooked fruit, vegetables, grains, seeds, nuts, and beans. The slim 29-year-old eats dozens of portions of fruit and vegetables every day, and has even created a number of recipes, including a cold soup made from a bag of spinach, a large bunch of herbs and an entire lettuce, to make meals more interesting. Youthful: Susan claims her raw food diet is the reason for her fresh-faced looks and healthy body . Her healthy raw diet is a far cry from her university days, when, she admits, she used to indulge in Chinese buffet suppers. She also loved McDonalds McChicken Sandwiches and used to enjoy crazy nights downing shots of vodka jelly as a teenager. However, all that changed when she became interested in yoga at the age of 21 during a six-month trip to India. After coming home Susan decided to become a vegetarian and trained to be a yoga teacher before stumbling across the raw food diet. 'I went for something to eat in a cafe called Red Sugar in Edinburgh, which served raw food,' she explains. 'The owners told me a bit about it so I went home, read up on it and decided to give it a go. The difference I felt in a day was incredible so I've done it ever since. I haven't had a hot meal in seven years. Tasty: Susan begins her day with a litre of green juice made from blended spinach, a lettuce and herbs . Business: Susan has turned her passion into a company that offers healthy raw food retreats to the public . 5am: Wake up, drink 750ml lemon water . 6:30am to 8:30am: Yoga practice. 10am: A litre of green juice made fromblending a whole lettuce, a bag ofspinach and bunch of herbs. 11am to 4pm: Snacks, including whole fruit (figs, mangoes, berries etc.), raw chocolate, green juice, and superfoods such as bee pollen and berries. 6pm: Large salad and/or green soups, or another raw dish created from fruit and vegetables, soaked nuts and seeds depending on what she feels she needs that day. 'The benefits include [mental] clarity, positivity, health, energy, radiance and the ability to make choices. 'Other things people have commented on include smelling good, great skin and youthfulness. People say I look good for my age. I'm also emotionally balanced and happy.' And Susan has now turned her passion for raw food into a business named Twist and Sprout, which offers healthy retreats where participants are taught how to introduce the raw food diet to their own lives. Tough though her regime might sound, Susan says she never suffers from cravings for cooked and maintains dietary discipline at all times. 'I feel if you sort out the emotional attachment to cooked food you don't crave it any more,' she explains. 'I focus on a very high liquid diet with lots of green juice, smoothies, soups and ""elixirs"". I try to get as much leaf green veggies in to my diet as possible. I eat fruits for energy and sparingly eat fats from nuts, seeds and coconut.' So dedicated is Susan to her raw food lifestyle, she even convinced her parents and boyfriend Louie, 22, to try the diet, and last Christmas prepared a raw food feast for them to enjoy. Creative: Susan has come up with a number of different menus and even managed to make raw mince pies . 'I made a fruit platter for starters - they loved it,' she reveals. 'We had raw mince pies made from nuts seeds and fruits for our sweet. I ate a giant salad with sprouted breads for my main course.' Nevertheless, Susan admits that her father David, who grew up in Glasgow, is unlikely to give up his pies despite regularly working out. Her mother Marion, meanwhile, is no stranger to unusual diets and according to Susan, cured herself of ME 14 years ago by completely eliminating sugar from her diet. 'Mum used to be practically bed-ridden but she reversed it with the sugar-free diet,' remembers Susan. 'She doesn't have ME any more. I think her experience was one of the things that inspired me.'","Susan Reynolds, 29, eats nothing but raw fruit, vegetables, nuts and seeds .

"If everything you want from a beach is sand, calm water and plenty of room to spread your towel, then this one has it all. But you would have to climb 780ft above sea level to the heart of the wild Pennine range to find it. Britain’s highest and perhaps most secret beach is 60 miles from the coast and only accessible via a 40-minute walk up a steep footpath above the village of Todmorden, West Yorkshire. Secret beach: Sun-seekers enjoy the warm weather on Britain's highest beach located at the Gaddings Reservoir almost 800ft above sea level in the South Pennines hills, West Yorkshire . In the middle of nowhere: The little-known cove situated near the market town of Todmorden is a haven for local sun worshippers wanting to get away from it all . It doesn't get better than this: . Kelly Weston and Nicole Marsden make the most of having the Gaddings Reservoir beach almost completely to themselves . Despite its remote location, the cove, located next to the Gaddings Dam, is a popular spot for locals in the know. And as the temperatures climb in the . summer heatwave, villagers have been heading to the spot with beachwear, . lilos and buckets and spades. Lauren Hurst has lived in Todmorden . all her life but only visited the beach for the first time last week. Now she has fallen in love with it. The 24-year-old, who works at the . Shepherd’s Rest pub three miles from the beach, said: ‘I have been to . the beach three times in the past week, and although I knew it was there . I didn’t know how nice it actually was. ‘Even though it’s relatively quiet during the week, the beach is absolutely packed with local people on a weekend.’ Relaxing in the sun: Kelly Weston and Nicole Marsden bask in the sunshine at the quiet beach by Gaddings Reservoir in the South Pennines . Worth the wait: Determined locals have to climb up steep footpaths for 40 minutes from the nearest village Todmorden to reach the isolated beach . Pub landlady Janet Sefton, 55, added: . ‘We have seen families absolutely pack the beach out recently, with . barbecues and canoes being brought up to the spot. It’s incredible that . we have a beach so high up and miles away from the nearest coast. ‘It does take a good walk to get to the beach, and it’s not for the faint-hearted, but it is totally worth it in the end. ‘It’s a fantastic spot and such a unique and secluded beach, and it brings us great trade to our pub from visitors to the area.’ Gaddings Dam covers an area of about . four acres and contains 100,000 cubic metres of water.

The sandy beach in its north-east corner is thought to be a natural feature, as sandstone dominates the local geology. Another theory is the sand was left over after the dam’s wall was built. At the turn of the century, a survey said the reservoir needed so much repair work that it was recommended for closure. But in 2001, enthusiast Jolyon Trimingham formed a pressure group to save it. The owner eventually sold it to a preservation group for £1,500, provided it was kept for the people of Todmorden.

Janet Sefton, 55, landlady at the nearby pub, said the beach is almost as popular with  residents as nearby seaside destination Blackpool. She said: 'We have seen families absolutely pack the beach out recently, with  barbecues and canoes being brought up to the spot. It's incredible that we have a beach so high up and miles away from the  nearest coast. 'It does take a good walk to get to the beach, and it's not for the faint  hearted but it is totally worth it in the end. 'It's a fantastic spot and such a unique and secluded beach, and it brings us  great trade to our pub from visitors to the area.' Gaddings Dam is approximately four acres and contains 100,000 cubic metres of  water. The dam has been emptied in the past but by the 1960s was full again and has  remained so ever since. The sand in the north-east corner is thought to be naturally occuring, as  sandstone dominates the local geology. Another theory is the sand was a by-product of dressing the stones for the  dam's wall.

"David Cameron faced a second by-election blow last night after a new survey suggested Ukip’s latest Tory MP defector Mark Reckless is on course for victory in Rochester. A Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday shows that Mr Reckless is nine points ahead of the Tories, and that Nigel Farage’s fans are not put off by the Prime Minister’s warning that voting Ukip will result in Ed Miliband winning power. The result is a slap in the face for Tory chairman Grant Shapps, who called Mr Reckless a ‘liar’ for breaking his promise to constituents not to defect. Scroll down for video . Mark Reckless and Nigel Farage last week after Mr Reckless left the Conservatives and defected to Ukip . And it flies in the face of a national poll which claimed the Conservatives had moved ahead of Labour for the first time in two and a half years after Mr Cameron’s tax cutting pledge at the Tory conference. The poll is the first in Rochester, Kent, since Mr Reckless’ defection, and was carried out after Mr Cameron’s tax giveaway pledge, suggesting areas where Ukip is strong are yet to be won over. When Mr Reckless announced he would call a by-election, Conservative chiefs were confident they would win. They believed maverick Mr Reckless lacked the credibility and popularity of fellow Tory MP defector Douglas Carswell, who is expected to retain his Clacton seat in Thursday’s by-election in the Essex seaside town by a big margin. But the Survation poll shows Mr Cameron faces an uphill battle in defeating Mr Reckless next month. Mr Reckless’ nine-point lead is far less than Mr Carswell’s massive 44-point lead in a Survation poll last month, but it means he is the early favourite to be Ukip’s second MP. Today’s survey shows Mr Reckless on 40, with the Tories on 31 – 18 down on their performance at the 2010 Election in Rochester – Labour 25 and the Lib Dems a paltry two. Unlike Mr Carswell, Mr Reckless is no pin-up in his constituency. Only 25 per cent of Conservative voters say Reckless is a hero for defecting, half Mr Carswell’s rating in Clacton. And 31 per cent say he is a ‘traitor.’ Only 12 per cent said they will vote Ukip because they like Reckless: Carswell’s personal vote was nearly three times higher. The new poll shows that Nigel Farage fans are not put off by David Cameron's warning that voting Ukip will result in Ed Miliband winning power . But they are sympathetic to Mr Reckless, who admitted he was once too drunk to vote in the Commons. A total of 48 per cent say it does not make him unfit to be an MP. Ukip’s popularity in Rochester is not driven by hatred of Brussels: local voters are only marginally in favour of leaving the EU by 41 per cent to 37. The poll also suggests that if he wins, Reckless could hold on to the seat at the General Election. Nearly nine out of ten Ukip voters said they would vote for him again next year. Mr Cameron’s vivid warning that on polling day next year voters may ‘go to bed with Nigel Farage and wake up with Ed Miliband’ appears to have been rejected. A total of 21 per cent Ukip supporters said it made them less likely to vote Ukip; 23 per cent said they were more likely to do so. Most said it would have no effect. However, Tory voters said by a ratio of 39 points to one that it would deter them from backing Farage. Survation chief executive Damian Lyons Lowe said: ‘If this snapshot of opinion in Rochester and Strood reflects the by-election outcome, the Conservatives will be worried. This seat is regarded as 271st in a list of the 650 parliamentary constituencies most likely to produce a Ukip victory. ‘If Mark Reckless is elected despite the Conservatives throwing the kitchen sink at the by-election campaign, other Conservative MPs may conclude it is safer for their political careers to defect to Ukip rather than stand and fight Farage’s insurgency.’ Mr Farage with Arron Banks, Ukip's new £1million donor, who switched to the party during the Conservative conference . Nigel Farage’s new £1 million donor pays a corporation tax rate of just 0.008 per cent on a multi-million pound insurance business, it can be revealed. Arron Banks, a former Tory supporter who switched to Ukip during the Conservative party conference, has paid the Treasury just £9,000 in corporation tax over the past five years from Rock Services Ltd – despite making gross profits of nearly £117 million over the same period. Last night Mr Banks, who is worth £100 million and has a controlling interest in a South African diamond mine, told The Mail on Sunday that the low corporate tax bill was the legitimate result of ‘offsetting administrative expenses against profits’. He said: ‘Stick your offshore tax story where the sun don’t shine’, before adding: ‘Up the revolution!’","Poll shows that Ukip defector Mark Reckless is nine points ahead of Tories .

"Coral reefs are often associated with tropical climates and enjoyed by snorkellers for their multi-coloured beauty. But it would take a brave holidaymaker indeed to brave the one recently discovered by Canadian researchers - it's in the freezing waters of southern Greenland. The reef is comprised of what are called living cold-water corals and while there are several species of coral in Greenland, this is the first time that an actual reef has been found. Vibrant: Cold water coral from the newly discovered reef off the coast of Greenland . The beauty of the depths: This picture of the reef almost cost the research team their camera . The newly discovered living reef is located off Cape Desolation, south of Ivittuut, and lies at a depth of 984 yards (900 metres) in a spot with very strong currents, making it difficult to reach. This also means that so far little is known about the reef itself and what lives on it. The reef was discovered by accident when a Canadian research vessel needed to take some water samples. When the ship sent the measuring instruments down to the depths, they came back up completely smashed. The newly discovered living reef is located off Cape Desolation, south of Ivittuut, and lies at a depth of 984 yards (900 metres) Coral reef in Beqa Lagoon, Pacific Harbor in Fiji. This is the kind of image conjured up when most people think of coral reefs . Fortunately, there were several pieces of broken coral branches on the instrument that showed what was responsible. 'At first the researchers were swearing and cursing at the smashed equipment and were just about to throw the pieces of coral back into the sea, when luckily they realised what they were holding,' says PhD student Helle Jørgensbye, of the Technical University of Denmark. Deep-water coral, also known as cold-water coral, tend to be found in deeper, darker parts of the oceans than tropical coral, ranging from near the surface to beyond 2,187 yards (2,000 metres) where water temperatures may be as cold as 4°C.Like tropical coral, they provide habitat to other species. They were first discovered by fishermen about 250 years ago.The world's largest known deep-water coral complex is the Røst Reef in Norway. It lies between 328 and 437 yards (300 and 400 metres) below the waves and is approximately 25 miles long and 1.9 miles wide. Another Canadian research vessel returned to the site last autumn to try and lower a camera down onto the reef to explore it close up. The coral reef is on the continental shelf itself where it is very steep and where there are strong currents. 'We got some photos eventually, although we almost lost them at the bottom of the ocean as the camera got stuck fast somewhere down in the depths,' said Mr Jørgensbye. 'It’s been known for many years that coral reefs have existed in Norway and Iceland and there is a lot of research on the Norwegian reefs, but not a great deal is known about Greenland. In Norway, the reefs grow up to 32 yards (30 metres) high and several kilometres long. The great Norwegian reefs are over 8,000 years old, which means that they probably started to grow after the ice disappeared after the last ice age. The Greenlandic reef is probably smaller, and we still don’t know how old it is,' he added, expressing the hope that at some point it will be investigated more closely. Coral reefs are important areas for fish because it provides masses of food and lots of hiding places for fish fry. The Greenlandic reef is formed from Lophelia stoney corals. Other species of coral are also found in many parts of the west coast. However, they are all 'stand-alone' corals and do not form reefs.","'Cold-water' coral discovered in Cape Desolation, south of Ivittuut .

"The Pentagon has scrupulously cataloged the number of 'airstrikes' U.S. forces have inflicted on the terrorism army that's running roughshod across Syrian and Iraq, but the official totals have lowballed the actual number of missile and bomb strikes considerably, MailOnline has learned. U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) issues near-daily press releases announcing how many airstrikes have been launched, and updating its total – which stood at 148 on Monday afternoon. A Pentagon insider familiar with logistics and planning in Iraq, however, told MailOnline on Friday that American aerial vehicles, including fighter jets and drones, 'have hit or destroyed well over 500 [targets] now.' 'The problem is that no one outside the [Department of Defense] knows what an airstrike is,' he said. 'Everybody thinks it's a single bomb.' Scroll down for video . An Iraqi soldier stands guard near a destroyed armored vehicle used by ISIS militants in northerern Iraq. US airstrikes have taken out hundreds of targets like this one, even as the Obama administration sends out more modest numbers . Some of the airstrikes over the weekend targeted ISIS positions near the Haditha Dam, but the number of airstrikes doesn't necessarily say much about the number of targets the US hit . These 500-pound GBU-54 bombs being loaded onto a US Navy jet can obliterate the most hard-armored Humvee, and the aircraft can carry four at a time . 'But think of a B-17 [bomber] during World War II. Those planes could carry lots of 500-pound bombs – 15 or 16 of 'em – on a single mission,' he continued. 'Today we strap 11 missiles and bombs to the underside of a single F-18 Hornet jet, fire all of that hardware at ISIS, and we call it a single airstrike.' The source, a career U.S. Army officer, spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to comment publicly about U.S. military operations. He also said a typical Predator drone can carry four Hellfire guided missiles at a time. The Pentagon has been atypically transparent about both its airstrike totals and the nature of the targets it's destroying. At the White House, a National Security Council spokesperson told MailOnline that the Obama administration is 'being very precise about that.' 'No one is lowballing the number of strikes,' the spokesperson said. Still, the 'airstrike' numbers and 'target' numbers rarely line up neatly in military press releases. And that could provide an opportunity for the Obama administration as it strains to meet an anxious public's expectations of tough talk. On Sunday, for instance, CENTCOM announced that the U.S. military had 'conducted four airstrikes Saturday' against the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), which the Obama administration has referred to by its alternate name ISIL. But that same announcement announced that 'the strikes destroyed five ISIL Humvees, one ISIL armed vehicle, an ISIL checkpoint and also damaged an ISIL bunker.' Another strike near Mosul Dam, described in the press release, 'damaged an ISIL Humvee.' Nine targets in all were destroyed or damaged. Similarly, CENTCOM said Friday that 'four airstrikes' had destroyed seven targets – 'an ISIL observation post, one ISIL Humvee, one ISIL armed vehicle, one ISIL truck, and three ISIL mortar positions.' MailOnline's Pentagon source did not discus specific targets or describe what kinds of armaments or ammunition was being used in the Middle East. Similarly, CENTCOM spokesman Major Curtis Kellogg said that 'we aren't going into detail about specific numbers and types of aircraft platforms or the types and numbers of ordinance [sic] used in airstrikes.' In emails on Friday, Kellogg confirmed that the U.S. has hit more targets than the raw number of airstrikes would suggest, calling that conclusion 'accurate.' 'An airstrike may include one or more platforms engaging multiple targets,' he said. Multiple bombs: This American F/A-18F Super Hornet jet comes equipped with 11 total 'hardpoints,' each of which can support a missile or a laser-guided bomb: 2 on the wingtips, 6 under the wings, and 3 under the fuselage . Obama told NBC News anchor Chuck Todd on Sunday's 'Meet the Press' broadcast that 'the next phase' of battling ISIS 'is now to start going on some offense' Why so modest? As White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest brags that Obama is willing 'to go wherever is necessary to strike those who are threatening Americans,' the Pentagon is putting out the most modest numbers available to show the president's level of aggression . As President Obama prepares to deliver a speech Wednesday in which he outlines a long-awaited strategy for attacking ISIS, both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill are calling on him to get tough with the Islamist terror group. The videotaped beheadings of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff have set off a firestorm of criticism in Washington, with voices all across the political spectrum suggesting that the president has waited too long to assume an aggressive posture. 'The president is a failure in this area,' Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch said Monday on the Fox News Channel, 'and I feel sad about it – and we will pay a heavy price in the end because he failed to act.' And in a USA Today op-ed, California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein wrote Sunday that Obama 'must lead an aggressive, international effort to confront and eliminate ISIS, including sustained airstrikes in Iraq and Syria.' 'We either confront ISIS now or we'll have to confront it later – when it will be a much stronger enemy,' she said. Obama himself is fighting a tough game of public perceptions fed by his widely varying statements about how the United States will handle the long-term threat ISIS poses to the American homeland. Last week in Estonia, the president boasted that he aimed to 'degrade and destroy' ISIS. But minutes later he recast his ambitions in a softer light, talking about making the murderous terror group a 'manageable problem.' That performance followed a disastrous moment at the White House when he stated that 'we don't have a strategy yet' to determine whether the U.S. would chase ISIS into Syria in addition to striking it over Iraqi airspace. 'We either confront ISIS now or we'll have to confront it later -- when it will be a much stronger enemy,'California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a fellow Democrat, warned the president in USA Today . But on Sunday in an appearance on the NBC News 'Meet The Press' program, he promised he would soon be 'preparing the country' for an armed confrontation. 'The next phase is now to start going on some offense,' he said, while qualifying his goals in the sense that they don't include 'U.S. ground troops. This is not the equivalent of the Iraq war.' Already, Obama's chief spokesman Josh Earnest is touting his boss's military-offensive bona fides. On Monday in the White House press room, Earnest boasted Obama's 'willingness to go wherever is necessary to strike those who are threatening Americans.' In that environment, two Republican congressional staffers told MailOnline, it may soon be time for the Obama administration to replace its periodic tally of 'airstrikes' with a more meaningful count of ISIS targets the Pentagon has hit. 'Not too long ago, the president didn't want to seem over-eager to pull the trigger,' one House of Representatives senior aide said, 'but now the game has changed. Why not do something to look tougher? If the numbers are there, use them.'","Official total of 'airstrikes' against ISIS terror network in Iraq hit 148 on Monday as Obama prepares to brief the nation Wednesday on his strategy .
But most of those strikes aim at, or destroy, more than one single target .

"Renowned children's author Roald Dahl may have famously written that it took 501 seagulls to help James fly the Giant Peach - but a scientific study has concluded that the actual figure would need to be significantly higher. Calculations by a group of University of Leicester physics students show a total of 2,425,907 birds would be needed to lift the peach - the size of a small house in Dahl's story - into the air. The undergraduates were inspired to use the childhood tale, which has delighted youngsters across the world since it was first published in the 1960s, as the basis for a scientific paper. James and the giant peach saw a young boy traveling in a large peach held by 501 seagulls. However, researchers now say it would have taken 2.5m to lift the huge fruit. The group first calculated the . weight of the peach, using measurements described in the book. By multiplying its density by its . volume, and using Newton's famous second law of motion, they arrived at a . figure of 4,890,579 Newtons - the amount of force it would take to move . the peach. Next, they worked out how much weight . each seagull could lift . They calculated this at just over two Newtons - allowing them to work out how many it would take to lift the peach. In the book, a young boy named James . embarks on a journey across the Atlantic Ocean on a magical peach, . enlisting seagulls to carry it. One . of the students, Emily Jane Watkinson, said: 'Our degree encourages us . to learn and apply real principles of physics to new and imaginative . topics, and as all of us knew the story and I particularly loved it, we . thought it would be a great idea to use it for our paper. 'Earlier in our degree, we studied the physics of aircraft and specifically what it takes to get them into the air. 'We thought it would be fantastic to apply that knowledge to the giant peach.' James And his Giant Peach in flight during the film version of Roald Dahl's classic book . The group first calculated the potential weight of the peach, using measurements based on the size of a small house, as described in the book. By multiplying its density by its volume, and using Newton's famous second law of motion, they arrived at a figure of 4,890,579 Newtons - the amount of force it would take to move the peach. Next, they worked out how much weight each seagull could lift based on its wingspan, the density of air around it and the speed it would travel. Written . in 1961 by Roald Dahl,  James and the Giant Peach tells the story of a . young English orphan boy, Henry Trotter. He enters a gigantic, magical . peach leading to a series of strange adventures with six insects . he meets. Originally titled James and the Giant . Cherry, Dahl changed it to James and the Giant Peach because a peach is . 'prettier, bigger and squishier' than a cherry. According to the book, the stone at the centre of the peach becomes a New York apartment where James lives. It was adapted into a film of the same name in 1996. They calculated this at just over two Newtons - allowing them to work out how many it would take to lift the peach. Emily-Jane added: 'It showed us that 501 seagulls would be nowhere near enough to lift the peach, and that it would take much more - nearly 2.5 million seagulls to do this. 'We've all had a brilliant time working on this project. 'It's been lots of fun, and it's been great using Roald Dahl's story as inspiration. 'It's also helped show us how to write a proper scientific paper.' A still from the Disney version of Roald Dahl's classic book, showing James at sea on his giant seagull powered peach . Course leader Dr Mervyn Roy, a lecturer at the university's department of physics and astronomy, said: 'A lot of the papers we published are on subjects that are amusing, topical, or a bit off-the-wall. Our students are nothing if not creative. 'But, to be a research physicist you need to show some imagination, and this is something that the module allows our students to practice.'

"An air hostess was left paralysed by a rare medical condition after dismissing a symptom of sore feet as being caused by the six-inch high heel shoes she wore on a night out. Gemma Flanagan woke up with pins and needles in her feet after partying in Las Vegas during a stop over, but ignored the pain and worked on the flight home. But days later she was dragging herself along the street when she collapsed outside her home and was soon frozen in her own body - unable to move, speak or even swallow. Symptoms: Gemma Flanagan thought the pain in her feet was caused by her six-inch high heel shoes . Recovery: Miss Flanagan was paralysed and had gruelling physiotherapy to learn to walk again . Jet-setter: The air hostess had been on a stop over in Las Vegas when she first noticed symptoms . Remarkable: Miss Flanagan has been going from strength to strength since returning to Liverpool . Rare: Guillain-Barre Syndrome simulates a nerve cell, causing the body to attack its own nervous system . The 29-year-old was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome, which affects only one in 50,000 people in the UK. She is continuing to make a remarkable recovery, having gone through gruelling physiotherapy to learn how to walk again. Miss Flanagan, originally from Liverpool, said: 'When I woke up after the night out in Vegas I was really achy and had pins and needles in my feet. 'I'm a really girly girl, and love wearing heels so I'm used to getting sore feet after a night out. 'I didn't think anything of it - I even worked on the flight home. I never in a million years thought I'd end up paralysed. It's a miracle that I've come so far.' Miss Flanagan had been back in Britain just a few says when she set off from her house in Surrey, for work at Heathrow Airport. Frozen in her own body: The 29-year-old was unable to move, speak or even swallow . 'Girly girl': Miss Flanagan said she loves wearing heels and is used to getting sore feet after a night out . Rare condition: Miss Flanagan was left unable to walk by the rare condition, Guillain Barre Syndrome . 'I left my house in Stanwell where I . was living at the time and made it onto the street, but I got as far as . crossing the road and I just collapsed,' she said. 'I was so embarrassed because I was . in my full cabin crew uniform and I couldn't get myself up - I had to . literally drag myself across the floor.' Guillain-Barre Syndrome is an autoimmune disease which affects just one in 50,000 people in the UK. Symptoms, including pain, tingling and numbness, begin in the feet and hands and move into the arms and legs. It can also cause muscle weakness, co-ordination problems, paralysis and even death. The exact cause is not known, but most people develop the syndrome after a viral or bacterial infection. It attacks the peripheral nervous system - the network of nerves outside the central nervous system, including the motor nerves, used by the brain to control muscles. Around 20 per cent of people never recover fully from the syndrome. Within two days of noticing the first symptoms, which included a numbing sensation in the arms and legs, Miss Flanagan was admitted to St. Peter's Hospital in Chertsey, Surrey. But . doctors were baffled by her symptoms and it was not until she was given . a lumbar puncture - an injection in the base of her spine - that things . become clear. 'When they did the injection, I was warned it would be painful but I couldn't feel a thing. I think everyone knew there and then that something bad was going on,' she said. Three days after Miss Flanagan returned from Las Vegas she was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Guillain-Barre syndrome simulates a nerve cell, causing the body to attack its own nervous system as it fights the infection and can cause paralysis and even death. Miss Flanagan said: 'To be honest I had no idea what it was - I couldn't even pronounce it. But I wasn't too worried. Doctors told me it was a mild case and I'd be home in three days.' Unfortunately for the 29-year-old, her condition began to deteriorate. She added: 'It was weird. I felt fine, but my body just wasn't working. 'Then my friend came to visit me and she asked me what was wrong with my face. I looked in the mirror and when I tried to smile, my mouth just wouldn't move. 'I was devastated. I suddenly realised how serious it all was.' That night Miss Flanagan . was transferred to the high dependency unit. She said: 'It was scary . because everyone else there was full of tubes and wires but I didn't . feel ill at all.' But again, Miss Flanagan began to deteriorate and after loosing her ability to speak or swallow, was transferred to intensive care. 'When . they moved me to intensive care, I was warned that I might not be able . to breathe for myself, and I'd need a tube fitted to feed me. 'They even mentioned the possibility that I could die. A week before I'd been having the time of my life' 'They even mentioned the possibility that I could die. I just couldn't believe it - a week before I'd been having the time of my life in Vegas.' But miraculously, after ten days in intensive care, Miss Flanagan responded to treatment and her condition stabilised. A month later, she was allowed to move to Aintree Hospital Liverpool, to be nearer her family. Miss Flanagan . said: 'Back in Liverpool I really started to feel better and was told I . could start rehabilitation. I was warned recovery would be a long and . slow process but by this point I could eat and speak again, so I was . starting to feel like myself again.' Miss Flanagan spent five gruelling months of physiotherapy at the Walton Centre in Liverpool, where she had to learn to walk again. 'It was a tough time but every little . thing was a big achievement. I'd get so happy if I could just wiggle my . toes or hold a pen. Inspiration: The air hostess is a Guillain-Barre Support Group volunteer and hopes her story inspires others . 'It . was hard being in rehab, but the staff were amazing. They encouraged me . to do normal things and did stuff like paint my nails for me. 'I couldn't have got through everything without the support of my friends, family and boyfriend' 'They . even helped me get dressed for a date and let my friends come in to do . my hair and tan - it's thanks to them I'm now with my amazing boyfriend . Neil.' Miss Flanagan finally returned home and has since been going from strength to strength. She said 'Leaving rehab was surreal, but it was amazing - it feels like I finally have my life back.' She has even started modelling for Models of Diversity, an agency that campaigns for diversity in models. 'I was browsing the Internet for some customized crutches on a site called Glamsticks, and on their website I came across Models of Diversity. 'I got in touch straight away, and I've just had some test shots done - I can't believe it. 'I just want people to know that just because someone is disabled, or in a wheelchair or on crutches, it doesn't mean they're not like everybody else. 'I couldn't have got through everything without the support of my friends, family and boyfriend, but I hope my story will inspire people, and change how disability is thought of.'

Before and after: 'I am really pleased I have had it done again - the techniques have improved a lot in the four years since I had the first one' Dr Jessen, 36, already had thinning hair before suffering from a debilitating bout of pneumonia last year, resulting in further hair loss. He . explained: 'Most of my hair grew back after the pneumonia but there was . just a bit less. Any serious illness can result in hair loss. The same . thing can happen to women after they give birth.' He had already had an implant operation four years earlier, but realised his hair could do with a second boost and was delighted when surgeon Asim Shahmalak at Manchester's Crown Clinic offered to help. He transplanted 3,000 hairs from the back to the front of Dr Jessen's scalp. Dr Jessen said: 'I hadn't realised that there was an option for a second hair transplant. When . I was told it was possible, I thought it would be good to make my hair . thicker at the front. There were also a few gaps which need filling. 'I am really pleased I have had it done again. The techniques have improved a lot in the four years since I had the first one.' After: Dr Christian Jessen had a hair implant operation four years ago, but his hair began thinning even more after pneumonia so he had another . He added: 'I am very pleased that I had it done - it has been very empowering for me. 'I thought to myself, ""Why am I always telling people how to change things about their bodies that they dislike if I can't do the same thing for myself?"" 'We view cosmetic surgery for men and women so differently. Having a boob job for a woman is seen as such an everyday thing these days, but for a man to have a hair transplant is seen as a far bigger step. 'There are so many men out there who want to have this done but don't dare. I just hope by talking about it openly that I will remove some of the stigma attached to men having cosmetic procedures. 'It's great that other celebrities with transplants like Wayne Rooney and James Nesbitt have gone public as well. 'It may mean that more do not suffer in silence. When a transplant is done well, it can really transform your life.' Hair today: Dr Jessen - pictured left before operation, right after - had 1,800 grafts (3,000 individual hairs) transplanted in a procedure known as Follicular Unit Transportation . Up 30 per cent of male hair transplant patients end up having a second procedure, because while the transplanted hair from the first procedure remains permanent, they can carry on losing their natural hair. Dr Jessen had 1,800 grafts (3,000 individual hairs) transplanted in a procedure known as Follicular Unit Transportation. The operation involved taking a strip of hair from the back of his scalp, then dividing it into individual hairs and planting them like seedlings into his hairline. It will take up to a year for the transplanted hair to fully grow back. Both of Dr Jessen's transplants were carried out by the surgeon Asim Shahmalak who has worked with a number of celebrities including Homes Under The Hammer star Martin Roberts and the model Calum Best. Dr Jessen had his first transplant with Dr Shahmalak in October 2009. He had always had naturally high temples and he disliked the 'curtains' hair style he had at the time with a floppy fringe.

Dr Christian Jessen from Channel 4's Embarrassing Bodies at Dr Asim Shahmalak's Crown Cosma Clinic in Manchester for a hair transplant . Dr Jessen, who works out up to six times a week, explained: 'I am not on TV for how I look. I am on TV because I am doctor, but I guess at first I didn't realise that your appearance is important and all part of the game. 'I did get some pretty hurtful comments. Some people would just say, '""You've got s*** hair,"" or they would write, ""Great body, pity about the hair."" 'After I had my first transplant all those negative comments stopped immediately and no one ever commented on my hair again. 'I have to do a lot of photo shoots for my job and I had never really enjoyed them before. I may give the impression when I am on TV that this all comes very naturally to me, but believe me, it doesn't. 'The new hair really boosted my confidence. I found doing photoshoots much more bearable.' Meet the doctors: Dr Jessen presents Embarrassing Bodies on Channel 4 with Dawn Harper, left, and Pixie McKenna, right . Dr Jessen said the fact that he worked out regularly had created an added pressure over his body image. He said: 'I've slightly dug a hole for myself. I have always worked out and I guess I got known as the 'fit young doctor,' though it was never a label I sought.  There is then this enormous pressure to keep it up. 'Your name crops up on blogs, chat rooms and forums like Twitter. They are not talking about your medical skills or your bedside manner – they just comment on your looks. TV star: Dr Jessen works out up to six times a week . 'After I went public after the first procedure I had so many emails asking me about it and where I had it done. You realise this is a very important issue to a lot of men. 'I guess if they see someone like me making no secret of the fact that I have had it done it might make it okay for them to have it too. 'I'm not urging others to have it done.  My message to men who are unhappy with their hair is to at least inquire. 'And if you do decide to have it done, be very careful about the surgeon you chose.' Dr Jessen said he chose Dr Shahmalak because they had worked together on his Channel 4 medical show Embarrassing Bodies. He said: 'We filmed him on the show after performing a hair transplant. The patient looked fantastic afterwards and I remember thinking, 'Wow that is great.' 'It occurred to me that I could benefit in the same way. 'Dr Shahmalak has a very nice manner and is very calm and I am very pleased with the results he gets.' Dr Shahmalak said he had enjoyed working with Dr Jessen for a second time. He said: 'I was able to fill in the gaps in his temples and transplant some new hair in his mid-scalp.' He said that many patients top up their first hair transplant with a second procedure a few years later. Dr Shahmalak said: 'Many men discover they need a second procedure a few years after their first one because their hair loss continues. 'You tend to find that if men start losing their hair at a relatively young age – say in their 20s – this hair loss tends to drop off in their mid-40s.' Dr Shahmalak said he was thrilled to operate on another doctor. He said: 'All my patients get the same level of care but it is true that there is an added pressure when you are operating on another doctor, particularly one like Christian who is so well informed and well read. 'I love the fact that I am the doctor's doctor. Being recommended by a doctor or treating a doctor is the ultimate compliment.'","Dr Jessen presents Channel 4 medical reality show .

"By . Anna Pursglove . This year, 41-year-old Gwyneth Paltrow let slip a little beauty secret. Her famously flawless complexion is not just the result of good genes and an organic diet but has been given a helping hand by a cosmetic procedure called Thermage. Dubbed ‘the ironing treatment’, Gwynnie says the procedure has taken years off her face and suits her much better than rival wrinkle-busting treatment Botox which the actress claims made her look 'crazy, like Joan Rivers'. Designed to tighten and smooth skin by promoting collagen production in its lower layers, Thermage smooths out wrinkles, tightens saggy jowls and reduces hooding around the eyes. Furthermore the treatment has no down time. Fans say it is the ultimate lunchtime beauty fix. BEFORE:  Anna Pursglove complained she had deeper wrinkles since turning 40 . AFTER: Anna has noticed that her skin is less crepey and more elastic after two sessions of Thermage . I am almost exactly the same age as Gwyneth Paltrow and share her blonde hair and pale skin (although sadly that’s where the similarity ends). I figure if Thermage can take years off Gwynnie then it might work for me too. Since turning 40 I have noticed that the skin of my neck and eyelids has got slacker while the folds running between my nose and the corners of my mouth have deepened. The skin under my chin is also beginning to sag. I would give anything for Gwyneth’s dewy complexion. And so I present myself at the Knightsbridge clinic of Dr Rita Rakus. Trusted by stars including Amanda Holden, Nancy dell'Olio, Lisa Butcher and Karen Brady, Dr Rakus, it is a leading light in the world of ‘non-surgical facial rejuvenation’, in other words she can make you look younger without using a knife. 'The demand for Thermage is massive since Gwyneth talked about it,' she confirms. 'I’ve got people flying in from all over the world for it.' As Dr Rakus prepares the treatment room, she tells me that Amanda Holden (a year older than me yet looking a least a decade younger!) is a fan of Thermage. 'She is part of that generation of women who want to look their best but don’t want that very ""done"" look,' she explains. 'What women tell me time and time again after having Thermage is that people comment on how well they look but never guess that they’ve had any kind of cosmetic procedure.' As Thermage fan Linda Evangelista puts it: 'For me, it’s for enhancement, like hair colour or make-up.' I confess, however, that I am nervous about the treatment. Friends who have undergone the procedure tell me that it is very painful and Gwyneth herself describes it as “a laser” that feels as though 'someone’s smacking your face with a rubber band that has an electric shock in it.' That doesn’t sound good. Dr Rakus starts off by tackling the science bit. Gwyneth, she tells me, is in fact wrong about Thermage being a laser. Gwyneth swears by 'Thermage' and says that Botox makes her look 'crazy' The treatment actually uses radio frequency (RF) energy. When the RF pulse from the hand-held Thermage tip hits the skin, the energy travels into its deepest layers where the plumping collagen is found. The energy actually damages the collagen making it recoil, tighten and then repair. The effect at the surface of the skin is both a tightening and a plumping one. And yes, acknowledges Dr Rakus, early forms of Thermage were quite painful because of the heat produced. It did indeed feel a little like being shocked or burned. However a new tip for the hand-held device through which the RF is delivered (called a ‘Comfort Pulse Technology’ tip) means energy can be delivered very effectively to the lower layers of the skin without any associated discomfort. I lie back in the treatment chair. Before we begin, a grid is drawn on my face (I look a bit like an extra from The Matrix), which allows Dr Rakus to make sure the heat is spread evenly. To begin with, she says, we will use a low setting and once she establishes how sensitive I am to the treatment, she can up the intensity. As the treatment begins, repeated passes are made over each area of my face and with each pass of the hand-held tip I feel heat followed by cold (the cold is from cooling gas built into the treatment head). I can honestly say that Dr Rakus is right - the procedure is almost completely painless (other than a sensitive spot reaching from my jaw line down my neck). In fact I’m so relaxed that as she glides the Thermage device across my face, we begin discussing the many benefits of the treatment. In addition to having no recovery time, Dr Rakus tells me, in some people the treatment produces a tightening effect immediately, which then develops over the following six months. The effects of the procedure can still be seen two and even sometimes three years later particularly if a top up treatment is given at around six months. 'I have been variously told that I look . slimmer, fitter, younger and more rested. However, . none of my friends suspects that I have had cosmetic assistance' She does, however, add that the effectiveness of Thermage very much depends on the condition of the skin in the first place. Heavy smokers or those with excessive sun damage are likely to see less satisfactory results as the tone and elasticity of the skin is so compromised. Moreover, says Dr Rakus, Thermage works as well on the body as on the face. Aged hands, baggy knees, saggy tummies, drooping bottoms and wobbly cellulite can all be improved using the technique. It is also suitable for use on any skin tone whereas some rejuvenating lasers cannot be used on darker skins. So why isn’t everyone having Thermage? After all Botox now seems to be available at virtually every beauty salon and dentist’s surgery. Dr Rakus explains that not only would a Thermage machine be extremely dangerous in non-skilled hands (incorrect use could result in facial burns and scarring) but also the technology itself is very expensive. Consequently a session of Thermage (lasting around an hour depending on the surface area of skin involved) costs £2,990 for the lower face and neck and £3,990 for full face and neck. And yet, says Dr Rakus, her clinic is not simply filled with an endless stream of actresses, TV stars and footballers’ wives. Ordinary women with modest incomes are coming to her in greater and greater numbers seeking facial rejuvenation. 'Yes these treatments are expensive but you’ll get results lasting years . 'Many women will save hard and spend the money that they would have spent on face creams, cosmetics and the like each month on Thermage instead. If you think of it as less than £100 a month then you begin to see where women find the money.' And nine months later (after one top up session at six months) can I see a difference? Well, everyone else certainly can. In fact I got a very satisfactory tightening effect in the days immediately after the treatment but it has been over the last few months that the effects have really started to show with my jaw line and jowls much improved and my skin less crepey and more elastic. I have been variously told that I look slimmer, fitter, younger and more rested. As Dr Rakus promised, however, none of my friends suspects that I have had cosmetic assistance with my newly freshened appearance. None of them has compared me to Gwyneth Paltrow yet but I live in hope.","Gywneth Paltrow uses 'ironing treatment' to stop wrinkles .

Desperate for water, the dog was captured cowering in the footwell on the driver's side. Scroll down for video . Police were forced to smash the windows of this car to free a dog found cowering beneath the wheel without any water on the hottest day of the year . Sgt Richard Berns posted a photograph of the car with its windows smashed on Twitter and wrote: 'This dog was left in this car on the hottest day of the year with no water or ventilation. It has both now.' According to ITV, the car's owner did return and questioned why the windows had been smashed. Officers said the owner was later spoken to and the RSPCA will be carrying out a home visit.

"Their nannying job entails keeping the babies clean, giving them bottles of milk, and keeping them busy so they don't misbehave. So far, so ordinary, but these nannies don't have any ordinary charges; their job is to look after and help raise orphaned baby elephants at Knysna Elephant Park in South Africa. The young women who do this are British volunteers who have given up their time to help provide 24-hour care to the young elephants who have been abandoned by their mothers. Scroll down for video . Abigail Hearn, 24, left, and Lisa Olivier, 28, are British volunteers who look after orphaned baby elephants . Nannies Paige White, 21, left, and Melissa Dora, 25, take baby elephant Fiela for a walk in Knysna, South Africa . They include Abigail Hearn, 24, from . Brighton, Lisa Olivier, 28, from Somerset, Phd student Lisa Howard, 28, from Somerset, Melissa Dora, 25, . from London and 21-year-old Paige White from Bristol. The volunteers work at the elephant park which is home to a semi-captive population of elephants, most of which have either been orphaned or rescued from abusive circumstances. Many of the baby elephants they have to look after are in the first few weeks of their life, and so despite weighing around 13 stone, need 24-hour care to ensure they eat enough and are reassured and happy after being rejected by their mothers. This means the elephant nannies develop a strong bond with their charges. Miss Hearn, a zoology graduate, was supposed to be at the park for six months 'but just never left' and has now been there 18 months. 'Back in England you wouldn't be able to get experience like it,' said the Nottingham University graduate. Elephant nanny Abigail Hearn feeds an orphan elephant alongside to large females in the South African reserve . Stunning backdrop: The main elephant herd in Knysna Elephant Park, South Africa, with staff . 'I get to go out and see the elephants every day and build a relationship with them. It's surreal - but wonderful. 'I couldn't have asked for a better job. When I go home to the UK and see my friends, family and boyfriend, I love telling them my stories.' Miss Hearn added: 'It's not uncommon in the wild for first-time mums to reject their babies but usually the matriarchs and older females will pick up the baby and present it to the mother. 'But in this kind of environment [semi-captive population] it's quite difficult to do that.' One of the jobs when looking after a new-born is making sure it drinks about two litres of mineral-enriched milk formula every two hours to ensure it is healthy. The elephant nannies have to ensure the newborn babies drink two litres of vitamin-enriched milk every two hours . The British volunteers have to give round-the-clock care to the babies, many of whom have been rejected by their mothers . The nannies must also ensure the babies are kept warm with a blanket during cold periods, provide fresh sawdust and a mattress in their sleeping pens, and help teach them about the world. Lisa Olivier said: 'They're such social animals and they learn through social learning so they're always busy, and they always need to be kept occupied. 'That's how they learn about the world and how to live the next 60-70 years.' Volunteers Melissa Dora, 25, from London, and Paige White, 21, from Bristol, take it in three-hour shifts through the night to comfort and reassure their baby elephants. Mrs Olivier, who is also researching for a PHD into elephant behaviour, said: 'Obviously they can't be with their mother at the moment and it's their mother who would comfort them if they woke up and got scared. 'We have to make sure they've got a fighting chance to go back to the herd and be accepted, so we want to make them as strong as possible.' In the wild, baby elephants are often rejected by first-time mothers and helped by others in the herd . Intense relationship: The elephant nannies develop a strong bond with the orphans they look after . Mrs Olivier, who has recently got married to South African elephant manager Theo, 27, said she even worries like the elephant was her own - especially when she makes 'strange noises' during the night. The Exeter University graduate first came to the park to study for her masters in animal behaviour, having previously worked in a clothes shop. She was only supposed to be there 10 weeks but has now been there nearly three years, working under Knysna Elephant Park founders Lisette and Ian Withers, and elephant expert Dr Debbie Young. Devotions: The elephant nannies groom their young charges and work on reintegrating them with the herd . The baby elephants need to be comforted in the same way that their mother would have comforted them . Mr and Mrs Withers founded the park in 1994 in honour of the diminishing herds of the Knysna Forest and to help those rejected by their mothers. Many have come from abusive circumstances, while others were earmarked for culling in overpopulated national parks throughout South Africa. As well as caring for the elephants, Knysna also conducts groundbreaking research into the relationships and dynamics of semi-captive herds. The ambition with the orphan elephants is to get them to the stage where they can integrate naturally as if they were in the wild.

"There are thought to be seven billion people living on our planet and this number is set to reach almost 10 billion by 2050, according to UN figures. This population explosion is largely attributed to better healthcare and farming practices, with some experts arguing that industrialisation in the 18th and 19th centuries was the tipping point that allowed more humans to thrive. However, one social scientist claims the human population explosion has its roots as far back as 2,000 years ago. There are thought to be seven billion people living on our planet in crowded cities (stock image) and this number is set to reach almost 10 billion by 20150, according to UN figures. A social scientists says that roots of the human population explosion lie 2,000 years ago, instead of in the industrial revolution as popularly thought . Aaron Stutz, an associate professor of anthropology at Emory’s Oxford College in Georgia created a new model of demographic and archaeological data to show when humans thrived. In a paper published in the journal PLOS ONE, he claims that political and economic reforms helped to create more stable families, and therefore enabled more people to thrive. ‘The Industrial Revolution and public health improvements were proximate reasons that more people lived longer, Professor Stutz said. ‘If you dig further in the past, however, the data suggest that a critical threshold of political and economic organisation set the stage 1,500 to 2,000 years ago, around the start of the Common Era. ‘The resulting political-economic balance was the tipping point for economies of scale - It created a range of opportunities enabling more people to get resources, form successful families and generate enough capital to transfer to the next generation.’ Professpr Stutz said: 'The Industrial Revolution and public health improvements were  reasons that more people lived longer...however, a critical threshold of political and economic organisation set the stage 1,500 to 2,000 years ago, around the start of the Common Era.' An mock-up of a Victorian cotton factory is pictured . Humans have used up the natural resources the world can supply in a year in less than eight months, campaigners warned last month. The world has now reached 'Earth Overshoot Day', the point in the year when humans have exhausted supplies. This includes natural resources such as land, trees and fish, and means today we have outstripped the planet's annual capacity to absorb waste products such as carbon dioxide. For the rest of the year, the world is in ecological debt, with food stocks and forests being depleted, land degraded and carbon dioxide building up in the atmosphere. The problem is worsening, with the planet sliding into 'ecological debt' earlier and earlier. This means the day on which the world has used up all the natural resources available for the year has shifted from early October in 2000 to August 19 in 2014. Around 86 per cent of the world's population lives in countries where the demands made on nature - the nation's 'ecological footprint' - outstrip what that country's resources can cope with. The Global Footprint Network, which calculates Earth overshoot day, said it would currently take 1.5 Earths to produce the renewable natural resources needed to support human requirements. The network warned that governments that ignore resource limits in decision-making are putting long-term economic security at risk. Population dynamics have been a hot topic since the late 18th century when English scholar Thomas Robert Malthus published his controversial essay claiming that population booms in times of plenty will inevitably be checked by famine and disease. His Malthusian Catastrophe theory was penned just before the global census size reaching one billion in around 1800. Just 120 years afterwards, the human population topped two billion and during the last 50 years it has surged to almost eight billion. While thriving has lead mankind to diversify and achieve incredible feats, some worry that too many of us sharing a limited amount . of resources, will one day lead to a worse standard of life and even . starvation. Professor Stutz describes the population explosion as ‘mind-boggling’. ‘The human population has not behaved like any other animal population. We haven’t stayed in any kind of equilibrium with what we would consider a typical ecological niche,’ he said. Economic historians and demographers have focused on societal changes that occurred during the Industrial Revolution as the explanation for the exponential population growth, but Professor Stutz thinks the reason for the explosion lies far earlier. He found that the potential for the human population to flourish despite environmental degradation, conflict and disease, could be traced to a subtle interaction between competition and organisation. At a certain tipping point, this interaction created opportunities for individuals to gain more control over their lives and prosper - opening the door to economies of scale. He said that the Roman Empire, which spanned 500 years from just before the Common Era to 476 AD, is a good example of passing through this threshold. It is known for its economic and political organisation, literature and advances in architecture and engineering. But for individuals, life was often hard, with labourers often dying young, having produced goods for trading and empire building. Large numbers of young men also had to serve in the military, potentially shortening their life expectancies. Professor Stutz said: ‘The vast majority of people who lived under Roman rule had a life expectancy into their late 20s or early 30s.’ ‘A huge swathe of the population was feeding, quite literally, on the dynamism that was taking place in terms of economic and political development. Despite fighting (illustrated) and many people dying young, Professor Stutz said that the Roman Empire is an example of a period when interaction between competition and organisation created opportunities for individuals to gain more control over their lives and prosper . ‘Their labour increased the potential for providing more democracy and competition on the smaller scale. That, in turn, led to a more complex, intergenerational dynamic, making it possible to better care for offspring and even transfer resources to them.’ The tipping point had been reached, Professor Stutz explained, and the trend continued despite the collapse of the Roman Empire. ‘The increasingly complex and decentralised economic and political entities that were built up around the world from the beginning of the Common Era to 1500 AD created enough opportunities for individuals, states and massive powers like England, France and China to take advantage of the potential for economies of scale,’ he said. His research, examining human population dynamics, could lead to better understanding of how economic and political organisation is affecting modern-day society. Professor Stutz warned: ‘We might wind up being back in a situation where a growing part of the population is basically providing labour to sustain a minority. You could certainly point to the sweat shops in the developing world.’","Scientist from Emory's Oxford College, Georgia, claims the population explosion began 2,000 years ago - long before other estimates .

"Co-op Bank is suffering a customer exodus after a tawdry sex and drugs scandal and revelations about its parlous finances. In a surprise statement to the stockmarket the bank admitted yesterday that there has been an increase in customers ditching their current accounts. The self-proclaimed ‘ethical’ lender acknowledged ‘recent events may have caused some brand and reputational damage’. 'He let the party down': Baroness Boothroyd with Paul Flowers in 1981 . It added that this had contributed to ‘an increase the Bank has seen in the switching out of current accounts.’ The lender could not put a figure on the number of customers that have deserted in recent weeks. However, experts pointed out that there must have been significant desertions for a stock exchange announcement to have been necessary. The statement is the first admission that many of the bank’s previously loyal customers have finally run out of patience. The bank is fighting to salvage its reputation after former chairman Reverend Paul Flowers allegedly organised drug-fuelled orgies with rent boys. Flowers has been bailed after being questioned by police. It comes on the eve of a crucial life or death vote for the 141 year old bank. Disgraced flowers . Thousands of its bondholders have to decide  whether to sanction a rescue package to plug a £1.5 billion black hole in its finances. If a large majority do not approve the deal, the bank could be wound down by the Bank of England. The first deadline in the crucial poll falls at 4.30pm today (Friday) and the final closing date to vote is early next month. John Mann, the Labour MP and member  of the influential Treasury Select Committee said: ‘It’s no surprise whatsoever that the Co-op is losing customers. ‘Many of my constituents are worried about whether their money is safe. The chancellor really needs to be out there providing reassurance.’ Hedge fund investors that want to win control of the bank have already committed themselves to the rescue package but the plan must also win the support of small bondholders. If the scheme fails bondholders stand to lose their investment but people with ordinary savings deposits of up to £85,000 are covered by the Financial Compensation Scheme. The bank is fighting to salvage its reputation after former chairman Reverend Paul Flowers allegedly organised drug-fuelled orgies with rent boys . In its statement to the City the bank said its recent troubles, competition from other banks and the introduction of seven day account switching in September have all contributed to defections by  current account customers. Rival banks have launched multi-million pound advertising campaigns, with Halifax offering £100 cash back to lure new customers. The Co-op’s financial problems mean it has been unable to compete for new customers with expensive advertising campaigns. The bank said it had not seen a similar level of departures by savers. The bank previously portrayed itself as a cut above its High Street rivals, presenting itself as an ‘ethical’ bank. This has proved a powerful lure for many customers fed up of the antics of mainstream lenders.But consumer campaigners said many who turned to the Co-op because of its claims to be ‘ethical’ have lost faith after recent revelations. The rescue package being voted on today (frid) involves the funeral homes-to-supermarkets Co-op group ceding control of the bank to a group of US hedge funds. The Co-op Bank will be floated on the stockmarket, meaning it will be owned by shareholders instead of members. The bank has desperately tried to persuade customers this will not compromise its ethics. But Laura Willoughby, chief executive of consumer campaign group Move Your Money said: ‘There is uncertainty about the future of the Co-op and its future as an ethical bank. 'Customers who went to the Co-op because of its ethical credentials are looking for other places to put their money. Many still don’t want to go to the big five banks. We are seeing strong anecdotal evidence that people are moving their money to building societies such as Nationwide.’","Bank announced more customers are ditching their current accounts .

"These stunning sculptures of heavy beasts have been fashioned from scrap metal. They are the work of artist John Lopez who welds the pieces from abandoned farm machinery. Based in the town of Lemmon, South Dakota, the 43-year-old has created full-size representations of creatures including a horse, buffalo and even a cowboy atop a triceratops. Mr Lopez had a successful career in bronze sculpting, but changed his working techniques after the death of his aunt Effie in a car accident. He moved to his widowed uncle Geno Hunt's ranch and set about making a family cemetery.

"It was close to 17 years ago, within the distance of a well struck goal-kick from the banks of the Suez Canal, that this all began. The date was September 6, 1997 and Spain beat Mexico 3-2 at the FIFA Under 17 World Cup. Playing together competitively for the first time were Iker Casillas and Xavi Hernandez — the Jagger/ Richards of world football. No-one who was lucky enough to hear Keith ’n Mick play for the first time, in the Marquee Club, Oxford Street, London back in July 1962, would have guessed that they’d still be filling stadia in summer 2014. VIDEO Scroll down for highlights of Spain's 2-0 win over El Salvador in final warm-up game . Crossing the great divide: Iker Casillas (left) and Xavi Hernandez are long-standing friends untied by a love of winning . Something similar goes for those who saw the Madrileno keeper and the saturnine Catalan midfielder become team-mates as well as friends in Egypt all those years ago. And while their friendship — which has unified the Spain squad, helping erase factions and frictions — is a key pillar in La Roja’s historic trophy treble, there’s something else about them. Clearly these are two of the great footballers of European history. Talented, technically intelligent — leaders. But they both possess a crucial need to keep on winning. Maybe it’s only the need for the megabucks which a well-run world tour can generate that keeps the Glimmer Twins on the road. But I doubt that it’s as simple as that. They, too, have a need to compete (with each other), a need to show the world that they can still cut it. And that is at the heart of the challenge facing the Spain of  Casillas and Xavi this summer. Side-by-side: Xavi and Casillas are chasing back-to-back World Cup wins . When their critics talk of Spain being ‘over the hill’ or that this might be ‘one tournament too many’ it’s really Xavi they are talking about. Others will be quoted — David Villa, Xabi Alonso, Casillas,  Fernando Torres — but Villa just won La Liga and made it to the Champions League Final, Alonso won the Copa del Rey and played a massive role in helping Real Madrid become European champions, despite being banned for the final when a silly booking in the semi-final trip blotted what had been an outstanding performance in Munich. Casillas, too, had a hand in Real’s cup double. But Xavi is the daddy of the group. Not only 34, but in the creative hot-house which has dug Spain out of so many dodgy situations while teams tried to shut them down or bully them out of games over the last three major tournaments. The way that he and Andres Iniesta link up down the centre of the pitch has accounted for a host of sumptuous tournament goals — either one of them given an extra inch or two of space and they’ll wriggle and fire off a salvo of passes and that’s that. Spain ahead. Game over. Nevertheless, for some years (beginning with Jose Mourinho’s Real Madrid during the Clasico wars of 2011) teams have decided to harass and try to test Xavi’s  athleticism — his will to run. There’s no denying that this all-time great of our sport is now struggling to put in a full offensive and defensive shift. If an opponent, with or without the ball, runs away from him, then it’s less assured that Xavi will be willing or able to track back and help avoid ‘overload’ on the defence. Tempus fugit — time flies — but it always has. Every great footballer has confronted this sudden draining of super powers. A magical journey: Casillas hoists the World Cup aloft four years ago as Spain capped their dominance of the global game . It’s how to cope, how to combat it, how to slow down time’s rusting process which counts.Even back in Euro 2012, Xavi felt the scythe. If not of Father Time himself then of the critics, mostly Spanish it has to be said, who felt his influence had declined. The matches chafed for Xavi, he was irked at being sniped at and still more narked that he felt he wasn’t putting his mark on games. Casillas’s challenges have been many, but not identical. It’s famous that his iron-clad individuality saw him stand up to, and clash with, Mourinho — to the extent that he was (unfairly) dropped. That was the tributary which led to a cascade; his place with Spain might have been in jeopardy given Carlo Ancelotti’s decision to maintain Diego Lopez (not even at this tournament) as Madrid’s No 1. Plenty to ponder: Casillas and Jose Mourinho did not see eye-to-eye . Some Madrid fans demonised him as the anti-Mourinho ring leader — he’s thought about leaving the club. But guys like these two know how to deal with adversity. There they were, if you cared to look, sat side by side on a bench at the side of the training pitch in Washington in midweek. They sat for 15 minutes talking about this and that, mostly that, while the rest of the squad did their thing. Two ‘veteran’ warriors.  Planning the assault to come. And this . is the nub of the thing. Around the world  people are desperate to write . about the end of an era — the football decrepitude which ‘apparently’ is about to engulf Spain. While . sporting obituaries are being written in advance of any actual . fatality, Spain’s ‘vets’ are obsessed by only one thing — not their . legacy, not the €700,000 bonus which allegedly they stand to win. Instead . they are obsessed with repeating the triumph, becoming the first . country to retain this title since Brazil did it in 1962. Part of that . has to do with their characters. Xavi pondered international  retirement . two years ago in Ukraine, before winning the Euros, and told Vicente . del Bosque so. The . manager said to him: ‘Are you crazy? Are you in a depression?’ — and . challenged Xavi to have a tilt at winning the most famous trophy in the . world in the country most  associated with doing just that thing. The . Pentacampeons of Brazil. Alonso, Sergio Ramos, Gerard Pique, Iniesta share that mentality, I know. Earlier this year, Luis Aragones, Spain’s former national coach, died. It was the old bear, El Sabio De  Hortaleza, who knew best how to harness the powers of Casillas and Xavi. It wasn’t him who set them off in Egypt all those years ago but, when he inherited them, he knew that this was an axis of greatness. Two men upon whom he could build a dream era — the captain-keeper and the champion-creator. On their will to win, their friendship, their ability to unify disparate talents, El Sabio constructed a football family — like-minded, similar DNA, a spread of ages. Old friends: Xavi and Casillas take some time out from training to ponder yet another successful World Cup . He had many phrases, and they are repeated. Torres admitted this week: ‘Not a day goes past in this squad where one of his sayings or an anecdote about him isn’t re-told. It’s like he’s still with us.’One became a favourite of the players: ‘El dueño de la pelota es dueño del juego,’ — whoever  dominates the ball, dominates the game. More now than ever that will work for Spain. This climate doesn’t give a premium for those who run around chasing possession. Step forward Xavi, still capable of keeping and using the football with precision and consistency.But it’s the other Aragones phrase which I think might allow Spain to surprise their critics and early  obituary writers. He told his troops: ‘Ganar y ganar y ganar...’ — win, win, win. He made them shed the nicey-nicey stuff, the ‘we are not worthy’ and he made them tremendously hard-nosed. He made this Spain group believe that winning wasn’t something, it was everything. Driving force: Xavi (right) is the heartbeat of this Spain side even at the age of 34 . What many forget is that the phrase had an extension. He used it, famously, in one of those press  conferences which made him extra famous. Thumping his closed fist on the desk in front of him he said that it was all about ‘ganar y ganar y ganar’ but then he added ‘y volver a ganer, y ganar y ganar,’— win, win, win and then go back and win, win, win again. That’s the spirit he encountered in Casillas and Xavi and, 17 years on, that’s what they are here in Brazil to do. Write La Roja off at your peril.","Xavi and Iker Casillas first played competitively together in 1997 as Spain beat Mexico in the Under 17 World Cup .

"It has been claimed that CIA agents on the ground during the deadly attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi twice asked for permission to help Ambassador Chris Stevens and twice were told to stand down. Furthermore sources present during the deadly six-hour assault have said that a desperate last request for military assistance once the CIA themselves came under attack was denied, even though elite counter-terrorism units were only two hours away. And it has been claimed there was full communication between the CIA annex in Benghazi and the U.S. military, casting further doubts on the Obama administration's assertion that there wasn't enough information to deploy forces - deepening the crisis over their handling of the attack on September 11th and its aftermath . Scroll down for video . Revelations: It has been claimed today that CIA operatives at the Benghazi consulate compound repeatedly had their requests for help denied during the deadly assault on September 11 . The lethal assault which led to the death of Ambassador Stevens and three other U.S. citizens began at 9.40 p.m. as the U.S Consulate came under fire from hostile Libyan forces. According to Fox News, ex-Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods, who was part of a small team at the CIA annex about a mile from the consulate, asked his superiors if he could go and assist the embattled diplomatic compound. However, they were told to 'stand down' and according to sources who spoke to the news channel were told to 'stand down' again after asking for a second time to help Ambassador Stevens and his staff. Ignoring these orders, Woods and two others heroically made their way to the consulate which by now was ablaze and began firing on the attackers. Knowledge: It is unclear who denied the requests of the CIA for special forces teams . The quick reaction force which Woods was part of helped an evacuation of the main building and recovered the body of State Department staff member Sean Smith who had died in the initial attack. However, the team from the CIA annex could not locate Ambassador Stevens and returned to their own base at around midnight where they came under attack themselves. Immediately calling for assistance from Sigonella Air base in Italy which is two hours away, it is claimed that two separate special operations teams and air support were told to wait - despite the gun battle raging for four hours. It is not known who denied the request for help for the CIA operatives on the ground at Benghazi. If true these claims will radically change the perception of the field agents who were operating on the ground in Benghazi. Previously criticised for providing inadequate security for the consulate staff, the new information shows intelligence operatives repeatedly tried to assist and in fact were denied their own requests for outside help. Killed: Ambassador Christopher Stevens (left) died following smoke inhalation, while agent Sean Smith (right) died in a . desperate battle . Heroic: Former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty (left) and Tyrone Woods (right) were killed in a mortar attack . Refuting the Defense Secretary Leon Panetta's claim yesterday that there simply wasn't enough information to responsibly deploy forces to Libya at the time of the attack, sources on the ground claim that communication was open throughout the attack. Indeed, one member of the CIA team who was on the roof of the annex was in possession of a laser to guide aerial targets including drones and repeatedly requested backup from a Specter gunship to take out an attacker firing mortars. According to sources familiar with the situation, the operative had visual contact with the Libyan mortar team and in addition was able to pinpoint positions from where the consulate attackers were firing from. Yesterday Leon Panetta claimed that he and General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General Carter Ham, head of the U.S. military's Africa Command, felt they couldn't 'put forces at risk in that situation.' A CIA operatives request for an AC-130H gunship to take down a Libyan mortar position was denied . Inferno: Armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate's exterior . Siege: The compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack, which lasted several hours . 'This happened within a few hours and it was really over before, you know, we had the opportunity to really know what was happening,' said Panetta. Furthermore, Fox News has learned that there were two military surveillance drones above the skies of Benghazi during the attack which would have been able to relay real time visuals of the assault to U.S. officials in the White House situation room and the Pentagon. Tyrone Woods and another former Navy SEAL Glen Doherty were killed by a mortar shell at 4 a.m. Libyan time, over six hours after the attack began and just one hour after relief from an American Quick Reaction Force sent from Tripoli had arrive. This new information comes as President Barack Obama's response to the attacks in Libya has become a contentious issue in the hard-fought U.S. presidential race, with Republican opponents raising questions about his administration's truthfulness and competence. Obama supporters have in turn accused Republicans of making unfounded accusations in an effort to score political points from the death of a U.S. ambassador and the three others killed in the Benghazi attack. Flames, grenades and gunfire: A burnt-out car in front of the U.S. consulate . The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Republican John Boehner, asked in a letter to Obama on Thursday about whether military options and assets were offered 'during and in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attack.' 'Can you explain what options were presented to you or your staff, and why it appears assets were not allowed to be pre-positioned, let alone utilized?' Boehner asked. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told Pentagon reporters that U.S. forces were on a heightened state of alert already because of the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington by al Qaeda. In the aftermath of the attack, Panetta reminded reporters that the Pentagon deployed a Marine fleet anti-terrorist security team to Tripoli and had Navy ships off the coast. 'And we were prepared to respond to any contingency. And certainly had forces in place to do that,' he said. Elite team: As the U.S. consulate in Benghazi . came under a devastating attack last month, a rescue team of elite . soldiers was denied the opportunity to assist the CIA who had come under attack . The administration initially attributed the violence to protests over an anti-Islam film and said it was not premeditated. Obama and other officials have since said the incident was a deliberate terrorist attack. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has attributed the shifting explanation to 'the fog of war.' A State Department email made public this week showed that two hours after the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission compound in Benghazi, the Department's Operations Center advised officials at various U.S. agencies that a militant group called Ansar al-Sharia had claimed credit on Twitter and Facebook for the attacks. U.S. officials, including Clinton, on Wednesday said that such Internet postings did not constitute hard evidence of who was responsible for the attacks. The State Department has set up an independent review board to investigate the background and response to the attacks. The U.S. Senate intelligence committee on Thursday said it will hold hearings in November - after the November 6 presidential election - on security and intelligence issues raised by the September 11 attack in Libya.","Revelations shed new light on the effectiveness of the CIA at Benghazi and the level of support they were given .

"Alan Pardew returned one of his self-labelled ‘death stares’ when Sportsmail dared to suggest this week that his chances of managing England had passed. He did, in fairness, kill the query with a smile – kind of – but his wider point was: ‘Why has my chance gone?’ He very quickly left the room. A parallel with Sam Allardyce was the subtext of the question; English managers once touted for the national job but no longer in the running, at least according to bookmakers’ markets and popular opinion, which has the likes of Gary Neville and Gareth Southgate as the heir apparents – even Nigel Adkins is quoted at shorter odds. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew has his side in sparkling Premier League form with six wins on the spin . Sam Allardyce has surprised many as West Ham make a charge towards the top-flight's top four . Roy Hodgson, of course, is safe until after England cruise through qualifying and flop at Euro 2016. And so the search will begin. Were we, however, to employ the yardsticks of performance and experience in determining the favourites, Pardew and Allardyce would lead the way. The pair meet at Upton Park on Saturday afternoon, Pardew’s Magpies flying high in fifth with Allardyce’s West Ham in their slipstream. They are the two longest-serving Englishmen in the Premier League – Pardew 12 days short of four years, Allardyce just six months behind. In total, their time in the dugout amounts to nearly 40 years. Yet the notion of them one day being employed by the Football Association appears to be dead. Allardyce – with his stock at its highest in 2006 – lost out to Steve McClaren for the England post and has long since been critical of foreign appointments. Argentine striker Mauro Zarate celebrates after scoring for the Hammers away at Everton last weekend . Moussa Sissoko runs towards Pardew after netting a late winner against QPR at St James' Park . Pardew, meanwhile, has muddied his own CV during the course of touchline confrontations with Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini and Hull midfielder David Meyler, not to mention shoving an assistant referee. Does all of that, though, not make their case all the stronger? They have dealt with adversity – a guaranteed circumstance with England – and survived; their longevity is unrivalled. Indeed, in the past 12 months both have been that ‘beleaguered boss’ at which the media takes aim, ultimately riding the storm to emerge in far more cordial climes. Pardew, from the position of comfort which six wins on the spin affords, addressed the issue this week. ‘In the Premier League you come under pressure from time to time,’ he said. ‘You have to be big enough to handle that. Some of it gets personal and you have to deal with that, you might not like it. ‘Sam has more experience of the Premier League than I do. He knows what it takes to win and he’s adaptable. Gary Neville (second left) has more of a chance of landing Roy Hodgson's job than Pardew or Allardyce . Even Reading boss Nigel Adkins is fancied more for the role than the two in-form Englishmen . ‘You have to keep your message consistent and not lose faith in yourself and what you’re doing.’ Are Allardyce and Pardew, then, simply better suited to the club-management environment in which they have thrived for so long? Pardew, it seems, still fancies a shot at England. Don’t forget, he was LMA and Premier League Manager of the Year in 2012 and part of the thinking behind his unprecedented eight-year contract with Newcastle was to inflate any compensation package should the FA come calling. But Team England have moved on. Rather, it is the Nevilles and the Southgates who are the future and a new ‘promote from within’ ethos. Pardew and Allardyce, meanwhile, are very much on the outside. Just don't mention that to their face.","Newcastle and West Ham are flying in the Premier League .

"Britain’s elite Special Forces have been ordered to soften their gruelling entry tests by the Government’s Health and Safety watchdog. Endurance exercises for those hoping to win places in the SAS and SBS have been made easier following a damning report by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) into the deaths of three soldiers who collapsed during a 20-mile march over the Brecon Beacons last year. The move has sparked fury among officers and troops in the tough fighting units, who fear the calibre of soldiers winning places will decline, lives will be put at risk and the regiments’ fearsome reputation will be undermined. Test of endurance: The SAS has been ordered to soften their gruelling entry tests by the Government's Health and Safety watchdog. Above, soldiers take a breather on a 50-mile march over the Brecon Beacons last year . Victims: The changes follow a damning report by the Health and Safety Executive into the deaths of Corporal James Dunsby (right), 31, Trooper Edward Maher (left), 31, and Lance Corporal Craig Roberts, 24, last July . Until now potential recruits would . have to go without food if rations ran low and find streams if they ran . out of water – skills SAS officers say are essential to survival in . combat. Candidates who had to be ‘rescued’ automatically failed. But . new rules, to meet HSE demands, include providing extra rations, giving . troops time to rest on marches, making sure safe drinking water  is . always available and introducing marshals to help stragglers cross the . finishing line. Tragic: The three soldiers, including L/Cpl Roberts (pictured), collapsed during a 20-mile march over the South Wales mountain range . In . the Brecon Beacons, recruits are expected to march up and down the . 2,900ft Pen Y Fan. Instructors use two routes, the steep and . inaccessible ‘Goat Route’ and the easier partly cobbled ‘Granny Route’. Now, . if candidates are struggling on the climb in adverse weather, they will . use the ‘Granny Route’ to avoid any emergency arising. And in the jungle section of the two-venue test, held in Brunei, if several recruits suffer heat exhaustion marches will be shortened or cancelled so they can recover and receive medical treatment. SAS sources say the pass rate has more than doubled since the changes were made in January ahead of the winter selection course. The Ministry of Defence refused to confirm this. The Mail on Sunday has been told that on the winter 2013 course, only 20 candidates out of 250 were successful. Of the 250 who started the winter 2014 course, 46 passed. Last night, an SAS source said: ‘This caused a massive spike in the number of candidates completing the marches inside the time limits and thereby qualifying to serve in Special Forces units. ‘The SAS and SBS cannot afford to accept candidates whose fitness, mental aptitude or military skills are in any doubt. The inspectors have no idea of the risks to soldiers’ lives when they’re in battle should training be compromised. ‘So even though the SAS and SBS have been struggling to fully staff their squadrons in recent years, there is no benefit to having a larger pool of guys as a result of the last course. Question marks will remain over their capability.’ The HSE imposed the changes following the deaths of Corporal James Dunsby, 31, Trooper Edward Maher, 31, and Lance Corporal Craig Roberts, 24, after an endurance march last July. Tough: In the Brecon Beacons (pictured), recruits are expected to march up and down the 2,900ft Pen Y Fan. Instructors use two routes, the steep and inaccessible 'Goat Route' and the partly cobbled 'Granny Route' The soldiers set off at around 6am . carrying heavy packs up and down Pen Y Fan. As the temperature peaked in . the early afternoon at 30C (86F), they ran out of water. L/Cpl Roberts was declared dead on the mountain while Trooper Maher died that evening in hospital. Cpl Dunsby died two weeks later from multiple organ failure. It was the biggest loss of life in the history of SAS selection. Afterwards, HSE inspector Sarah Baldwin-Jones launched an inquiry. In October, she sent a Crown Improvement Notice, a document stating that the selection courses breached the Health and Safety at Work Act. The notice casts blame on Special Forces instructors. Scene: SAS sources say the pass rate has more than doubled since the changes were made in January ahead of the winter course. The Ministry of Defence refused to confirm this. Above, the Brecon Beacons in Wales . The inspector added that as the emergency unfolded, with at least six recruits showing signs of severe heat sickness, these instructors ‘failed to review risk assessments’. Special Forces chiefs were ordered by the HSE to present new risk control measures and to ensure that, in future, sufficient quantities of hot rations and safe drinking water would be available. The HSE confirmed last night that regulators had accepted new risk assessments and safety measures presented by the military. The Ministry of Defence said: ‘We have co-operated fully with the Health and Safety Executive inspectors and are implementing all the recommendations in the Crown Improvement Notice.’ A police inquiry into the deaths is continuing, with more than 100 instructors and soldiers being interviewed.","Gruelling entry tests for UK's elite Special Forces have been made easier .

"Too frightened to talk to strangers, Owen Howkins had become a withdrawn little boy who hated being in public because of his rare genetic disorder. But the eight-year-old has overcome his anxiety with the help of a three-legged dog who has 'changed his life'. The pair have become inseparable after the family pet helped Owen - who suffers from a rare genetic disorder - overcome his nerves around strangers. The eight-year-old has overcome his crippling anxiety with the help of a three-legged-dog who has 'changed his life' Heartwarming: A book has now been written about how the pair have become inseparable . Owen Howkins with dad Will, stepmother Coleen and Haatchi, the dog who has restored his confidence . The true story of Haatchi and Little B is a heartwarming novel about the pair's friendship . And now the youngster has helped pen a book - called Haatchi and Little B - about how the dog has completely transformed his life. Owen told ITV's This Morning: 'He's my best friend in the whole world.' Speaking about the moment he met Haatchi, he said: 'He put his head on my lap and that's how we became best friends forever.' The story of how the pair have become firm friends describes how Owen became 'withdrawn' at school when he realised a rare genetic condition made him different to other boys and girls. It left him scared to talk to people and worried about leaving his home in Basingstoke, Hampshire. But now the little boy has flourished after Haatchi - an Anatolian shepherd dog - has given Owen a new lease of life. Speaking on This Morning on ITV, the confident schoolboy now says his life has transformed because of his pet. He said: 'I used to be scared of strangers and I used to put head (down) like that before Haatchi came. 'But when Haatchi came I wasn't scared. 'He changed how I felt about being in a wheelchair. He's special because he changed my life.' Owen suffers from Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, which means his muscles are always tense. The schoolboy's father, Will Howkins, . adopted the pet from a rescue centre. The pair can be seen walking down . the road together after becoming the best of friends. Will said that when he and Owen’s step-mother, Colleen Drummond, went to get the dog they did not know it would have such a strong impact on their boy, explaining that they wanted Haatchi as a dog for the family. ‘We had no idea that it was going to help Owen,’ he told MailOnline. ‘About three weeks after we brought Haatchi home Owen wanted to take him for a walk in his wheelchair. ‘That day he was still hiding in his wheelchair. But he got more confident when people were complimenting his dog and then he realised that people were looking at Haatchi more than him in his wheelchair.’ Will said that he and Colleen were initially hesitant to go about writing a book but decided to try it after Owen and Haatchi’s victory at Crufts. ‘We spoke to Owen about it and he loved the idea. And that’s how it started,’ Will said. ‘He likes the fact he is now an author and he is thrilled by it. He loves the fact people are able to read about his syndrome and understand it.’ The three-legged dog helped a little boy with a rare condition overcome his fear of outside world . Owen's father adopted Anatolian Shepherd Haatchi, who had lost a leg after being tied to a railway track . Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, which is an inherited disorder, causes muscle stiffness and weakness. There are two types of Schwartz-Jampel syndrome – one which becomes apparent in later childhood, and another which is apparent at birth. The disease, which cannot be relieved by medication or sleep, leaves muscles permanently tense. Other symptoms can include joint deformity, a curved spine and a short stature. Speaking about his decision to bring Haatchi into the family, Will said: ‘It was more he chose us than we chose him. ‘At . the foster home, they brought Haatchi in and he came bounding up to her (Colleen). And it was the first time he had wagged his tail since the . operation. ‘She broke down and had to persuade me to take him – and it didn’t take a huge amount of persuading.’ Haatchi himself had a difficult start . in life, suffering horrific injuries when he was tied to a railway line . and hit by a train. He was found days later, cowering, with a mangled tail and back leg. By the time he was taken to a vet's surgery, nothing could be done to save his leg and tail and both had to be amputated. Haatchi's future looked bleak as the RSPCA and UK German Shepherd rescue centre struggled to find him new home. But he was eventually adopted by father Will and his wife Colleen Drummond who read about the animal's plight on Facebook. Colleen, who has been part of the family . since Owen was three, said: 'As soon as they met, the effect Haatchi had . on Owen was incredible. The dog and boy quickly became inseparable and Owen now loves taking Haatchi to dog shows . The family pet helped Owen - who suffers from a rare genetic disorder - overcome his nerves around strangers . 'Before his arrival, Owen didn't like going out. 'When he first started school, he became more aware of being different, and he became even more withdrawn.' Owen's condition requires regular hospital treatment but the simple joy of being around the 'energetic puppy' makes it easier for him to cope with.","Owen Howkins had become withdrawn and hated being in public because of his rare genetic disorder .

"Alvin Brissett, pictured, claimed that he was gay moments before he due to be deported to Jamaica . A violent father-of-two escaped deportation moments before being put on a plane to Jamaica – by suddenly declaring he was homosexual. Alvin Brissett, 55, was ordered to be sent back to his Jamaican homeland after building up a long criminal record including thefts, drug possession, and assaults. Yet at the last moment, while he was in handcuffs in a van at Gatwick airport, he announced that he was gay and claimed he could not be sent to Jamaica because he could face discrimination there. This claim halted his deportation in its tracks. And even though a hearing subsequently ruled it would have been lawful to send him home, as Home Secretary Theresa May wished, he has now won the right to remain. Two immigration judges have ruled that his human right to a family life is more important than the Government’s wish to protect the public from him. Conservative MP Philip Davies said: ‘This case perfectly shows how the law is an ass. We must be a complete laughing stock.’ Asked about claims that he was not really gay, Brissett told The Sun: ‘I had a right.’ Mrs May spent thousands of pounds of public money to remove Brissett from Britain. Brissett, of Stratford, East London, was 13 when he came to Britain. He has 18 convictions for theft, three for possession of drugs, and four for assault. In 1993 he was jailed for seven years for robbery, and ten years ago he received a 12-month sentence for theft and threatening behaviour. Then, in 2009, after he was jailed for a street attack, the Home Office ordered that he should be sent to Jamaica. Brissett immediately began using human rights laws – and his right to a family life – to contest the deportation, but all his appeals failed. In March 2011, Mrs May signed his deportation order. It was shortly afterwards, as he was on his way to the plane, that he made his gay claim. Police immediately turned round and returned to a police station. A series of further hearings followed, and judges have now ruled he is free to remain. There has been growing concern about the way criminals and failed asylum seekers defeat deportation orders by using the clause of the Human Rights Act guaranteeing a right to a family life. Claims that the deportee will face discrimination or violence in their homeland are also often accepted by courts, despite scepticism by others.

"A UK Independence Party election candidate has been suspended from the party after being caught on camera apparently making a Nazi salute – bringing further scandal to the party ahead of Thursday’s local elections. UKIP leader Nigel Farage admitted the latest revelations about members 'doesn't look very pretty' as he was again forced on to the back foot over the failure to vet people standing in this week's local elections. The latest photo to emerge is of Alex Wood, candidate for Blackmore Vale in Somerset, which was posted on Facebook, along with racist comments. In another picture, part of a series of images, the 22-year-old clenches a knife between his teeth against a backdrop of the Union Flag. UKIP candidate Alex Wood, who is standing in the Somerset County Council elections, is pictured apparently making a Nazi salute. Wood said he was reaching for a camera . Mr Wood, pictured clenching a knife between his teeth in front of a Union Flag, denies being a racist . UKIP said Mr Wood's party membership 'was suspended pending the police investigation' after pictures and comments emerged online. Comments saying that Africans ‘lived in mud huts’ and ‘kill each other’ also appeared under his name on the Facebook page, but he told the Mail last night that he ‘categorically denies’ posting them. He said: ‘My account has been hijacked – by that I mean someone, somehow, has gained access to my Facebook and posted personal pictures of me without me knowing. 'Claims that I am a racist are categorically untrue and all comments of a racist nature on Facebook were not posted by me.’ A string of revelations about UKIP candidates have dogged the party ahead of Thursday's elections. It also emerged that John Sullivan, a UKIP candidate in Gloucestershire, is alleged to have made the homophobic comments on Facebook. He is said to have claimed that regular exercise 'prevents' children from 'becoming' gay. He also suggested the Victorian method of physical exercise 'released tension and thus avoided homosexuality', but it was unclear whether these are Mr Sullivan's views or whether he was just talking about Victorian attitudes to sport and homosexuality. James Carver, UKIP agent for the Forest of Dean and West Gloucestershire, confirmed he will continue to stand for election on Thursday. Mr Wood, the UKIP candidate for Blackmore Vale in Somerset, appeared outside his home near Sherborne today . Mr Wood has insisted the 'Nazi salute' picture was taken out of context, but has been suspended from the party . Mr Farage was again forced to admit the party does not have the resources to check the backgrounds of everyone standing for election on a UKIP ticket. Challenged about the pictures of Mr Wood, Mr Farage said: 'That doesn’t look very pretty, I agree with you, and we have had, out of out 17,000 candidates, a handful that have embarrassed us, most of them because they simply haven’t told us the truth. 'We’re the only party in British politics who actually forbid former members of the British National Party or extreme organisation from even becoming members of UKIP, let alone candidates, and in one or two cases, people haven’t told us the truth, but I’m pleased to say it is only a handful,' he told BBC Radio 4. Mr Farage also courted controversy when he referred to 'coloured people' during an interview to reject claims UKIP supporters are racist. Party aides later stressed he was referring to comments made by former Tory councillor John Cherry, who resigned last week after suggesting inner-city children from a ‘coloured area’ would not be welcome at a proposed new school in the countryside. Pollsters predict UKIP could make major gains in Thursday's elections of between 50 and 100 seats. But the campaign drive has been over-shadowed by revelations about some of the party's candidates. Mr Wood defended the photograph of him raising his left arm, insisting it was in fact a picture of him at a Christmas party reaching for his friend’s camera after she had taken pictures of him ‘trying to eat from a tree’. Party leader Nigel Farage has come under pressure to suspend Mr Wood, pictured together . ‘It sounds stupid, I know,’ he said. ‘But it’s true.’ He added: ‘I do not wish to say anything else as it is being investigated by police.’ Mr Farage last night came under pressure to suspend Mr Wood. UKIP suspended 24-year-old Chris Scotton, a candidate in Leicester, at the weekend after it was revealed he backed online groups with racist views. The release of the image also comes after a series of other humiliating incidents for the party, including a UKIP candidate being investigated by police over allegations of electoral fraud. Northumbria Police said officers were investigating a report of alleged electoral fraud in the Cowpen area of Blyth. Detective Inspector David Brown said . on Sunday: ‘We can confirm that we have received a complaint... We are . in the early stages of the investigation.’ Last week UKIP were also forced to respond to a series of revelations about candidates’ racist pasts. Others are accused of making homophobic comments or saying that vigilantes should kill paedophiles. And on Saturday UKIP MEP Godfrey . Bloom sparked fresh controversy when he repeated his call for company . bosses not to employ women of child-bearing age. Branding maternity rights ‘draconian’, he said: ‘I would say be very, very careful indeed what that young woman has to offer. Ken Clarke, left, said UKIP voters are racists and politicians in the party, led by Nigel Farage, right, are clowns . ‘If I wanted a receptionist or a . dental nurse, I would be thinking very carefully about the age of that . woman because she has to turn up at nine o’clock every morning. This . isn’t rocket science.’ It comes after veteran Tory Cabinet . minister Ken Clarke claimed UKIP voters are racists and said the party's . politicians are clowns. Mr Clarke said UKIP is merely a protest party and those attracted to it are ‘waifs and strays’ who are simply ‘against’ foreigners and immigrants. Recent polls showed that Nigel Farage’s Eurosceptic party has overtaken the Liberal Democrats and is set for its best local election results ever on Thursday, when 35 county councils and unitary authorities in England and one in Wales go to the polls.","Alex Wood, 22, is standing in council elections in Somerset .

"A cosmetic surgery clinic that submitted, to several magazines, advertising photographs featuring 'problem areas' of female patients, was repeatedly told to replace the images with something more 'aesthetically palatable'. MYA Cosmetic Surgery, whose celebrity clients include Imogen Thomas and members of the TOWIE cast, said the adverts were a response to the recently published Cosmetic Surgery Review and a move away from using celebrities. The promotion featured photographs of body areas of 'real women' with real problems, pinching their 'muffin tops', 'jelly bellies', and 'bingo wings', illustrating the problems that MYA report are the most commonly bemoaned treatment areas for their Vaser Liposuction procedure. MYA beauty clinic, who offer minimally-invasive liposuction, were told to replace these adverts with something more aesthetically pleasing . The ads featured a banner asking, 'Can’t shift your…?' above the small, non-offensive pictures, before going on to offer information about the new procedure. Advertisers at several magazines rejected the images, requesting that the body area shots be replaced with the body of a slim, tanned model in a bikini. Michael Tilley, MYA's Marketing .

"The parents of a BBC journalist who is thought to have committed suicide after suffering alleged sexual harassment at work have blamed the corporation for failing to prevent his death. Radio reporter Russell Joslin, 50, whose father is a former chief constable, suffocated despite being on suicide watch at a psychiatric hospital. Close friends and relatives have told the Daily Mail he had been left a ‘shadow of his former self’ after feeling that bosses failed to act on his complaints about a senior woman colleague. Tragic: Russell Joslin, pictured left in 2008 and right, more recently, was being harassed by a female colleague . They said his descent into mental illness began after he allegedly spurned unwanted sexual advances by the woman broadcaster during a night out at a restaurant near his home in affluent Kenilworth, Warwickshire. Mr Joslin’s parents said he was forced to leave her in the restaurant because of her behaviour, after which she sent him a flurry of abusive phone messages which have been played to the Daily Mail and in which she swore and belittled him. Peter Joslin, the retired chief constable of Warwickshire, said that while questions need to be asked at the hospital over how his son was apparently able to take his own life, the BBC should hold an investigation into his treatment. Mr Joslin, 78, added: ‘There is some evidence to support accusations that Russell was being sexually harassed or bullied. ‘I am shocked to discover the apparent attitudes of certain individuals to their employees at the BBC. ‘I believe he was ignored by his bosses, despite outlining his concerns about the particular staff member he claimed had sexually harassed him. ‘He enjoyed his work at the BBC but in recent years the situation had become intolerable for him there.’ St Michael's hospital where Russell Joslin was admitted for help and later found dead . Mr Joslin, who lives with wife Kathy next door to their son’s home, retired in 1998 after 44 years’ service – the longest-serving policeman ever in the UK. He said his son’s alleged ‘sexual harassment’ by the female colleague at BBC Coventry and Warwickshire was the ‘trigger’ which caused his mental illness. There had been ‘plenty of opportunities’ for managers to intervene after he complained, but ‘nothing was done to help him’. Mr Joslin said he felt more should have been done to pick up the problems as his son was clearly quite distressed. Their son was admitted to St Michael’s psychiatric hospital in Warwick on Friday after suffering minor injuries when he walked in to the road and was hit by a bus in an apparent suicide attempt. Mr Joslin senior said the hospital ‘specialises in people who are at high risk of committing suicide and he was checked every 15 minutes.’ 'It's what he would have wanted': Joslin's Father, Peter, 78, a retired chief constable, welcomed the involvement of the Police . He was found choking on Sunday and taken to nearby Warwick Hospital, where he was pronounced dead the following afternoon. His family and his ex-girlfriend, Lucy Poulson, claimed that after propositioning him in the restaurant, the woman – no longer at the station – began targeting him in other ways at work, deliberately cutting him off while he was on air. It is understood that Mr Joslin, a bachelor who covered south Warwickshire for the station, first complained about her to management after she sent him an unpleasant email. He is thought to have approached bosses again early this year to complain about being sidelined at the station, concerned he had been overlooked for news reading and presenting opportunities. Miss Poulson said he then became consumed by worry and stress ‘because he knew that people don’t go very far by speaking out against organisations like the BBC’. He was diagnosed with depression and suffered a breakdown soon afterwards. Miss Poulson, 28, a freelance theatre director, told the Daily Mail that the BBC had paid for him to receive counselling. His GP and the corporation’s own occupational health specialist all advised him not to return to work at the station for the good of his health. But despite this bosses told him he would have to return full time before he could think about transferring to another station. Mr Joslin eventually went back to work three months later, but on a part-time basis. Miss Poulson said she split from Mr Joslin in 2010, after four years together, but the pair remained close. She said that in recent months he had been ‘the happiest I had known him’ and was considering returning to freelance journalism. She said that for years he felt unable to speak out against his tormentor. When he finally did pluck up the courage to speak out, she said the office climate left him fearful for his job and future. Miss Poulson added: ‘Russell told me that this woman treated many people badly at the station, but nothing was done because of her senior status. 'It seemed everybody was scared to tackle her. People need to know that this culture still exists – of allowing certain individuals to be in control, when others don’t seem to matter.’ Russell Joslin recorded the following three messages from his female colleague after he left her in the restaurant. ‘Thanks a lot, you’ve p***** on your chips. I’m trying to get a taxi to Coventry. Thanks for abandoning me. Don’t ever ever ever think of me as your mate again. Do what you have to at the BBC because you are a loser on 27 grand a year. But don’t ever ever encroach on me or my talent.’ ‘Hi, it’s me. I’m in a taxi from Kenilworth to Coventry. Russell, don’t ever count on me as a friend. I’m going home. Please don’t think you can rely on me – you’ve insulted me. You have left me stranded in Kenilworth. You are flaky, you are poor, you are weak. I don’t want anything to do with you except on the radio. Goodbye.’‘Hi, it’s 9.21. I’m back at my car. Don’t ever ever ever presume friendship with me again, all right? Goodbye.’ Neither Warwickshire Police, responsible for policing in Kenilworth, or West Midlands Police, which covers Coventry, could find any record of Mr Joslin reporting the alleged harassment. The woman he accused said there was never a complaint against her and she denied any wrongdoing. She said she was asked by managers to try to help him. She told the Daily Mail: ‘I got a message to say Russell had died. I’m really upset about it and can’t say any more.’ Told of the Joslin family’s allegations that his illness had been triggered by her alleged behaviour, she said: ‘I don’t know what you are talking about’ and put the phone down. Mr Joslin’s colleagues are being offered counselling by the BBC. His funeral is to be held on Wednesday. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Our thoughts and condolences are with Russell Joslin’s family at this sad time. 'This is a difficult time for everyone who knew him. 'The BBC is committed to working constructively with the family to ensure that their concerns are vigorously addressed. It would not be appropriate to comment further until the facts are established.’ An inquest into Mr Joslin’s death was opened yesterday at the Warwickshire Justice Centre in Leamington Spa. Coroner Sean McGovern was told the radio presenter died of ‘asphyxiation’ as a result of a ‘plastic bag in an airway’. Contact the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 if you need help or advice.

"Trout pout: Actress Leslie Ash had a botched lip filler injection by a doctor who used liquid silicone . A shocking report has already linked anti-wrinkle dermal  fillers to permanent blindness in three patients. Now a leading cosmetic surgeon has claimed that there have been at least 30 cases of vision loss – and that the injections have also caused strokes in some patients. ‘These are not one-in-a-million instances,’ claims Dr Julian De Silva, a London-based plastic surgeon who specialises in  facial procedures. Fillers are gel-like substances that are injected under the skin to add volume and give a plump, youthful appearance. Alongside Botox, they represent a third of all non-surgical cosmetic procedures carried out in Britain. The value of the UK cosmetic procedures market was £2.3 billion in 2010, and it is estimated that figure will grow  to £3.6 billion by 2015. Non-surgical procedures account for 75 per cent of the total. Yet because fillers are legally classified as implants rather than drugs, they are not subject to the same regulations, and as such they can legally be injected by anyone – trained or otherwise. The jabs are behind the much derided ‘trout pout’ phenomenon, where the gel is injected into the lips in order to enlarge the pout. However, the outcome can often look cartoonish and unsightly. Depending on the type of gel used, the result – no matter how garish – can be permanent. In 2000, actress Leslie Ash famously suffered the ‘trout pout’ effect after having her lips injected with liquid silicone by a Venezuelan doctor. Yet a poor cosmetic result is just a minor complication compared with the potential risks involved. ‘The problem comes when filler is accidentally injected into an artery,’ explains Dr De Silva. ‘This can lead to necrosis, or death of the skin tissue, and if they’re the arteries that supply oxygen to the back of the eye, this can lead to loss of vision. In a worst-case scenario, filler can even block oxygen supply to the brain, resulting in a stroke.’ Aside from the recent three cases of blindness, there were similar claims in 2012 – one report highlighted 32 cases,  while the second study revealed 12 incidents of spontaneous, permanent vision loss after  filler injections. There have also been at least four reported instances of stroke, in which the blockage in the blood supply leads to tissue death and brain damage. These were the result of filler injections of the patients’ own fat taken from another part of their body, claims Dr De Silva. Danger jab: Dr Julian De Silva, a London-based cosmetic surgeon, claims there has been at least 30 cases of vision loss and that fillers have caused strokes . Due to lack of regulation, under-reporting of complications is common, and manufacturers have no obligation to publish details of problems. ‘Because these side effects are under-reported, many practitioners don’t even know that there’s a risk of them happening, let alone have a plan of action for when they do,’ warns Dr De Silva. In the UK, more than 120 fillers are licensed for use, yet in the United States only 21 can be used. In the UK in 2010, one filler, Novabel, manufactured by Merz Pharmaceuticals, was withdrawn just seven months after being licensed as patients experienced swelling and hard lumps forming beneath the skin. Two years ago, Q-Med, the company behind the popular Restylane fillers, advised that another of its products, Macrolane, originally designed to be used in breast augmentation, should not be used in this way because it could hamper breast cancer diagnosis. Both incidents fuelled fears that UK consumers were being used as guinea pigs. Other doctors have raised concerns about delayed reactions to new-to-the-market fillers that can cause sudden pain and disfiguring swelling months after being injected. Dr Darren McKeown, a cosmetic doctor who has clinics in London’s Harley Street and Glasgow, says: ‘As a trained medical professional, dealing with delayed inflammatory reactions is a challenging medical problem and I have serious concerns that less qualified practitioners might not have the requisite skills to cope, or that many may simply refuse to take responsibility for such a delayed side effect.’ Dr De Silva advises: ‘You should know before your procedure exactly what is going to be injected into your face and what the side effects could be. ‘I suggest using only hyaluronic acid-based fillers as these can be broken down if the patient has a reaction to them, and only having fillers that have been approved in the US because they have a good safety record. ‘And make sure you’re in the hands of a qualified medical professional with knowledge of the anatomy of the face.’","Dr Julian De Silva claims been at least 30 cases of vision loss .

"This dramatic CCTV footage captures the moment a shop worker says he fearlessly disarmed a man who was said to be pointing a gun in his face whilst attempting to rob the store. Hunar Mohammed, 37, says he was working behind the counter at the shop in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire on Saturday night when a man came in and asked for cigarettes and alcohol. As the father placed the items in a bag and worked out how much was owed, the man allegedly withdrew a gun and demanded the money from the till. Dramatic: CCTV captured the moment a man is said to have pulled a gun on a shopkeeper in Hertfordshire . Displaying astonishing calm, Mr Mohammed says he snatched the weapon, which was apparently a replica firearm in the blink of an eye. The shopkeeper, who is from Sulaymaniyah in Kurdistan, said he was not frightened during the episode as most people in his country carry guns for security. He said: 'It's the first time this has ever happened in my life but I wasn't that scared as everyone has guns in my country that they keep for security. 'I've handled a gun before as well. I did what any normal person would do. In this second, my mind said to do this and I did it. Mr Mohammed claims the man came into the store and asked for cigarettes and alcohol . As the shopkeeper turns back to his customer, the man was seen with something in his hands . Mr Mohammed, who has a three-year-old daughter, added: 'He didn't leave with anything and for that I am glad. 'My family have said congratulations to me. My wife was scared  but she is okay now. 'My step-sons couldn't believe it. They asked ""How did you do that so quickly?""' Mr Mohammed's account of the incident has turned the shopkeeper into a local hero. A man apparently pointing a gun at the shopkeeper . Mr Mohammed then apparently snatches an object from the man's hand . With the object now in Mr Mohammed's hand, the other man then appears to leaves the shop .

"Louis van Gaal’s frustrations in the transfer market have reached new heights after his pursuit of Argentina defender Marcos Rojo was stalled by a row between the 24-year-old’s agent and his club Sporting Lisbon. With the Barclays Premier League season due to start when United host Swansea at Old Trafford on Saturday lunchtime, the club have now not signed a player since they spent more than £50million on Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera in the last week of June. It is understood Van Gaal is growing increasingly irritated by United’s failure to land targets and last week saw interest in Belgium defender Thomas Vermaelen come to nothing when the 28-year-old moved from Arsenal to Barcelona.

Now Van Gaal and United chief executive Ed Woodward are facing obstacles as they attempt to sign Rojo after Sporting became embroiled in a bitter public row with the Doyen agency that represents the player. With Doyen owning 75 per cent of the South American, Sporting are understandably keen for any potential buyer to meet a release clause of £24m. United have so far offered £16m but Sporting have accused Doyen of encouraging interest from the English club and of sending an employee to a meeting with them pretending to be an Old Trafford director. United were refusing to comment publicly on the matter but it is understood their interest in the player remains active. Indeed, they have not ruled out movement on the issue over the weekend.

"Fiona Apple has postponed her South American tour so she can take care of her dying 13-year-old pitbull, whom she calls her 'best friend, mother, daughter and the one who taught me how to love'. In an extraordinary four-page letter posted to her website and Facebook page, the singer explained her decision to forgo her 12-date tour, which was due to start in Brazil next week. 'Here's the thing,' she wrote in the scanned letter. 'I have a . dog Janet, and she's been ill for almost two years now, as a tumor has . been idling in her chest, growing ever so slowly. 'I know that she is . coming close to point where she will stop being a dog, and instead, be . part of everything. She'll be in the wind, and in the soil, and the snow, and in me, wherever I go. Best friends: Singer Fiona Apple is pictured walking her dog Janet in 2008. She has now postponed her South American tour to care for the pet, whom she believes is dying . 'I can't come to South America, not now. If I go . away again, I'm afraid she'll die and I won't have the honour of singing . her to sleep, of escorting her out.' The poetic letter explains she found Janet in Echo Park in Los Angeles ten years ago 'with a rope around her neck, and bites all over her ears and face' - a sign she had been used as a fighting dog. But after taking in the four-month-old puppy, Apple realised the dog was in fact a 'pacifist' who went on to provide 'the most consistent relationship of my adult life'. 'We've lived in numerous houses, and jumped a few make shift families, but it's always really been the two of us,' she wrote. 'Please understand': Apple was due to perform 12 dates across South America starting next week . The dog gave her support 'every time I was  heartbroken, or spirit-broken, or just lost' and sat beside her as she wrote and recorded four albums, Apple explained. But recently, Janet has slowed. She suffers from Addison's disease, an adrenal deficiency, and requires regular injections of Cortisol. Two years ago, veterinarians found a tumor in her chest. 'When I got back from the last leg of the US tour, there was a big, big difference. She doesn't even want to go for walks anymore,' she wrote. 'I just can't leave her now, please understand.' She concluded her letter by explaining that, although she often takes 20 minutes to choose which socks to wear, the decision to drop out of the tour was easy. Love letter: Apple posted a letter to her site explaining her decision. Click on the images for enlarged versions . Devotion: The letter explained that she did not want to miss 'the honour' of spending Janet's last few moments alive, after they have spent 13 years together. Click on the images for enlarged versions . 'These are the choices we make, which . define us,' Apple explained. 'I am not the woman who puts her career . ahead of love and friendship. 'I am asking for your blessing. I'll be seeing you.' She was scheduled to perform three concerts in Brazil next week, then travel to Argentina and Mexico, but fans put aside their disappointment to commend Apple for her decision. 'It is clear that the bond you have with Janet is one . that deserves to be treasured,' fan Lauren King wrote on Facebook. 'I commend you for making the right, but . probably most difficult choice. It speaks volumes about your character.' Olga de Oliveira added: 'Dear Fiona, we're so sad reading this, 'cause many of us are waiting for your concert since 1996. But be sure, 99 per cent of your Brazilian fans are with you, wishing you all the best. Your heart is exactly where it should be.' Back on track: Apple, pictured performing in Florida, began touring this year after a five-year hiatus . Apple released her debut album, Tidal, in 1996. She stopped touring in 2007 but returned earlier this year with the release of her fourth album, snappily entitled The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do. In September, the 35-year-old singer was arrested after police found hashish and marijuana on her tour bus at a West Texas border patrol checkpoint. She spent the night in Sierra Blanca and was released the following day after posting $10,000 bail. It's 6pm on Friday, and I'm writing to a few thousand friends I have not met yet. I am writing to ask them to change our plans and meet a little while later. Here's the thing. I have a dog Janet, and she's been ill for almost two years now, as a tumor has been idling in her chest, growing ever so slowly. She's almost 14 years old now. I got her when she was 4 months old. I was 21 then, an adult officially - and she was my child. She is a pitbull, and was found in Echo Park, with a rope around her neck, and bites all over her ears and face. She was the one the dogfighters use to puff up the confidence of the contenders. She's almost 14 and I've never seen her start a fight, or bite, or even growl, so I can understand why they chose her for that awful role. She's a pacifist. Janet has been the most consistent relationship of my adult life, and that is just a fact. We've lived in numerous houses, and jumped a few make shift families, but it's always really been the two of us. She slept in bed with me, her head on the pillow, and she accepted my hysterical, tearful face into her chest, with her paws around me, every time I was heartbroken, or spirit-broken, or just lost, and as years went by, she let me take the role of her child, as I fell asleep, with her chin resting above my head. She was under the piano when I wrote songs, barked any time I tried to record anything, and she was in the studio with me all the time we recorded the last album. The last time I came back from tour, she was spry as ever, and she's used to me being gone for a few weeks every 6 or 7 years. She has Addison's Disease, which makes it dangerous for her to travel since she needs regular injections of Cortisol, because she reacts to stress and to excitement without the physiological tools which keep most of us from literally panicking to death. Despite all of this, she’s effortlessly joyful and playful, and only stopped acting like a puppy about 3 years ago. She's my best friend and my mother and my daughter, my benefactor, and she's the one who taught me what love is. I can't come to South America. Not now. When I got back from the last leg of the US tour, there was a big, big difference. She doesn't even want to go for walks anymore. I know that she's not sad about aging or dying. Animals have a survival instinct, but a sense of mortality and vanity, they do not. That’s why they are so much more present than people. But I know that she is coming close to point where she will stop being a dog, and instead, be part of everything. She’ll be in the wind, and in the soil, and the snow, and in me, wherever I go. I just can't leave her now, please understand. If I go away again, I’m afraid she'll die and I won't have the honor of singing her to sleep, of escorting her out. Sometimes it takes me 20 minutes to pick which socks to wear to bed. But this decision is instant.These are the choices we make, which define us. I will not be the woman who puts her career ahead of love and friendship. I am the woman who stays home and bakes Tilapia for my dearest, oldest friend. And helps her be comfortable, and comforted, and safe, and important. Many of us these days, we dread the death of a loved one. It is the ugly truth of Life, that keeps us feeling terrified and alone. I wish we could also appreciate the time that lies right beside the end of time. I know that I will feel the most overwhelming knowledge of her, and of her life and of my love for her, in the last moments. I need to do my damnedest to be there for that. Because it will be the most beautiful, the most intense, the most enriching experience of life I've ever known. When she dies. So I am staying home, and I am listening to her snore and wheeze, and reveling in the swampiest, most awful breath that ever emanated from an angel. And I am asking for your blessing.I'll be seeing you. Love, Fiona .","Singer wrote four-page letter explaining her decision to fans .

"A stray dog who was seized by the Taliban and saved the lives of two British soldiers in Afghanistan is a contender for a prestigious prize at world famous dog show Crufts. Brin, a four-year-old Afghan Kuchi Tiger Mix mongrel, was close to death weighing only 13 kilos when he was found by the Coldstream Guards wandering around a deserted road in Lashkar Gar, Helmand, Afghanistan, in 2010. Brin instantly stopped the guards and prevented them from walking over a deadly IED bomb hidden in the desert. Brave: Afghan dog Brin being looked after by Captain Mark Townsend in Helmand Province in 2010 . British army officials then adopted the homeless canine and took him on dangerous patrols before he was seized by the Taliban. Remarkably, Brin survived and was re-captured but when his adopted army unit moved out of Helmand, the dog was set to be deserted and killed, as is army procedure. Animal lover Sally Baldwin, 51, raised more than £4,000 just in time to get Brin home after learning of his plight through rescue charity Nowzad. Ms Baldwin, who looks after Brin at her home in Hailsham, East Sussex, said: 'I think the fact that the Taliban didn't kill him is an amazing stroke of luck. Caring: Sally Baldwin with Brin at her home in Hailsham in East Sussex . Soldier dog: British army officials adopted the homeless canine and took him on dangerous patrols before he was seized by the Taliban. He was rescued by Sally Baldwin who now cares for the dog . 'I have no answer to why they saved his life, normally they would have shot him. They must have thought they had something valuable. 'The fact that he is alive and living here in the UK is quite seriously an everyday miracle. 'It beggars belief. The fact he has made it to the centre stage of Crufts is phenomenal - it makes us smile every day. 'He is the voice of animals who have no voice in the theatre of war. Very little thought is given to the suffering of the animals through no fault of their own. Brin being on that centre stage is that voice.' On parade: Brin at an army patrol base in Helmand Province in 2010. Brin is now a finalist in Crufts . Man's best friend: Clever Brin stopped guards and prevented them from walking over a deadly IED bomb . Brin has been nominated to pick up the gong in The Kennel Club Friends For Life' category on March 10 at the NEC arena in Birmingham. A live television audience will decide between five nominated dogs as to who receives the £1,500 cash prize, which goes to the owner's chosen charity. Ms Baldwin, who has owned more than 10 shelter dogs in her life, has been preparing for the ceremony by watching clips online. She said: 'On the day Brin has to go on centre stage with the other dogs and wait for the public vote. He will be fine. Brin was close to death when he was rescued in Helmand. The bright dog now loves his new home in East Sussex and has been nominated for an award in Crufts . 'He is quite heavy at the moment at 31 kilos. He needs to be about 28 kilos, it is a mark of a dog that has been starved that they hold on to the weight. 'My dog was nominated for the award by someone at the Nowzad Charity. There is something about him that seriously touches people. 'Brin was always at the front of the patrol leading the brave lads back to safety through the dangerous areas. He is truly amazing.' Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary, said: 'The dogs nominated for this year's Friends for Life competition help to remind us what it is that makes the relationship between dog and man so very special. 'Each and every one of the finalists has helped to change and save lives, and can teach us all a lesson about loyalty, companionship and bravery.'","Brin was close to death when he was found by British soldiers in Helmand .

"The Church of England is fighting to claim the rights to minerals beneath thousands of homes and farms, it emerged last night. Legal action has already begun, raising fears the Church could try to cash in on the controversial process of fracking. Under a new law, landowners have until October to assert their rights over minerals. The Church still holds rights in several parts of England, including some places where geologists believe energy can be extracted by fracking . Residents across the country have now started receiving letters from the Land Registry, informing them that the Church is seeking to register the mineral rights to the earth beneath their property. Church Commissioners – who manage the Church’s investments – are trying to assert  ownership of 500,000 acres of land, an area roughly the size of Sussex. The claim, which lawyers believe could allow the Church to profit from fracking, is being made under laws dating back to the Norman Conquest. The age-old laws give ‘lords of the manor’ the rights to extract anything of value from the earth underneath property on their estates. The Church still holds these rights in several parts of England. Residents and environmentalists have mounted strong opposition against shale gas drilling near their homes, claiming the process could contaminate water supplies and even trigger earthquakes . These include some places where geologists believe energy can be extracted by fracking – the controversial process of extracting oil and cash by fracturing underground rocks with water and chemicals. Residents and environmentalists have mounted strong opposition against shale gas drilling near their homes, claiming the process could contaminate water supplies and even trigger earthquakes. But the commissioners have started sending legal letters to residents informing them of the Church’s ‘unilateral’ right to benefit from any mines and minerals under their land. One recipient spoke of his concerns that the Church’s claim could be linked to future fracking projects. Dr Richard Lawson, a retired GP who lives in the Mendip Hills in Somerset, said: ‘It’s an ethical question for the Church – will they use their mineral rights to block fracking or to make money out of it?’ And one recipient, whose home in Nottinghamshire is less than five miles from an area with proven oil reserves, said: ‘It’s quite perplexing that you can own your own home but then someone comes along and tells you they own the ground beneath your feet. ‘It’s a bit of a coincidence that this happens when people are talking about fracking.’ However the Church has released a statement insisting that they have ‘no particular plans to mine under any property,’ adding: ‘This is confined to registering what the Commissioners have owned for many years. There is absolutely no link with fracking.’","Under law landowners have until October to assert their rights over minerals .

"What do you get when you cross a Segway and a mobility scooter? The electric RYNO scooter that is apparently impossible to fall off. The one-wheeled, battery-powered scooter can travel at a speed of up to 25mph and can be parked anywhere, free of charge. It was designed by Portland-based RYNO Motors specifically for commuters to help beat the traffic and avoid expensive parking charges. Scroll down for video . The RYNO, pictured, is a one-wheeled, battery-powered scooter that can travel of speeds up to 25mph. Because of its size, the RYNO can be parked anywhere a bike can be parked. It was designed by Portland-based RYNO Motors for commuters to help beat traffic and avoid expensive parking charges . To drive the RYNO, the driver must lean forward to accelerate and backward to decelerate. The RYNO scooter is also fitted with self-balancing technology that means the scooter can automatically right itself if the driver leans too far to the left or right, or too far forwards or backwards . The RYNO works like a Segway - the driver must lean forward to accelerate and backward to decelerate. But unlike a Segway, the RYNO scooter is also fitted with . self-balancing technology that means the scooter will automatically right . itself if the driver leans too far to the left or right, or too far . forwards and backwards. It weighs 57kg and can cope with slopes . of up to 30 per cent gradient. The idea for the scooter came from the daughter of the firm's CEO Chris Hoffmann in 2009. She had seen a one-wheeled motorbike in a game she was playing and asked her Dad to make one for her to ride to school. Hoffman said: 'With a product like RYNO, a rider can slip behind a wall, cut up the alley, around behind the big oak tree, down though the park and emerge at a destination long before anyone driving a car could ever get there. The RYNO scooter weighs 57kg, and can cope with slopes of up to 30 per cent. Its battery can be removed and plugged into electricity sockets to charge. It then takes around 90 minutes to fully charge the device . 'Plus a RYNO can be parked anywhere a bike can be parked, free of charge.' The designers also claim it can be . taken on trains and driven through pedestrianised areas and shops in the . same way mobility scooters can. Its inventors add: 'Or simply ride the RYNO through a lobby and up the elevator to your own apartment.' Although the RYNO reaches speeds of 25mph, it is regulated when being driven in cities and towns to 12.5mph. The RYNO's battery can be removed and . be plugged into electricity sockets to charge. The RYNO is classified in the same group as mobility scooters. This means it can be driven in pedestrianised areas and inside buildings. It is also light enough to be carried onto trains or into houses. Although it has a top speed of 25mph, the RYNO is restricted to 12.5mph when driven in a town or city . The company claims it . takes around 90 minutes to fully charge the device. Hoffman continued: 'See . what happens when you ride through the streets, it’s the same . everywhere, people think they’re watching something out of a video game. 'Even though it takes less than an hour to learn to ride, onlookers think you have the skill of a circus performer.' The RYNO is set to go on sale from August 2013. The company hasn't released full specifications or price details but it is expected to cost around £2,250, according to figures released when the concept was launched in 2010.

"Naturally sculpted: Fillers are used to try and emulate the naturally sculpted features of stars like Angelina Jolie . Injectable skin fillers could be the next cosmetic scandal after PIP breast implants, leading surgeons said yesterday. Plastic surgeons warned of a ‘timebomb’, saying fillers are ‘completely unregulated’, with anyone who has completed a half-day course allowed to inject them into patients. Fillers, a gel-like substance used to smooth wrinkles and plump up cheeks, were once the preserve of the rich and famous. But they are becoming increasingly popular in the mainstream  among women hoping to emulate stars with naturally striking, sculpted features, such as Angelina Jolie. As well as being offered by hairdressers and beauticians for about £250 a time, fillers are also widely available on the internet for self-injection. In the US, where they are regulated, only seven types have been cleared for use – yet more than 150 are offered on the British high street. They are sold legally without safety checks. Nigel Mercer, former president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said there had been an ‘inexorable’ year-on-year rise in demand for skin fillers. In a study of cosmetic surgeons in 2009, one in four reported seeing patients who had received botched jobs. Experts yesterday warned skin fillers could become the next cosmetic disaster after the PIP furore, in which it emerged 47,000 British women were given breast implants filled with non-medical grade silicone. 'Ticking timebomb': Experts warned that fillers should only be injected by a doctor . Mr Mercer said: ‘It is a ticking timebomb. We believe [fillers] should be a prescription-only medicine. ‘We are contacted by patients who have ended up with unsightly lumps under the skin which can only be removed with surgery, people left with scars after one of their arteries was injected and people can even go blind if it is injected too close to the eye.’ He said only doctors, nurses or other trained medical practitioners should be able to dispense them. ‘There are reputable providers, but you see all the emails offering dermal fillers from China and we have no idea what they contain. You can make this stuff using a chemistry set,' he said. Most fillers contain substances found naturally in the body such as collagen or hyaluronic acid, but it is unclear what else is inside, Mr Mercer said. The association yesterday also called for a crackdown on advertising for plastic surgery such as facelifts and tummy tucks, saying they lure children and the vulnerable to go under the knife. In a 12-point plan submitted to the Advertising Standards Authority, it called for a ban on such promotions on billboards, in magazines and online, aimed at under-18s or using celebrities. Association president Fazel Fatah told its annual meeting in London: ‘Some providers take advantage of people who seek surgical treatments for psychological reasons, with unethical and very aggressive marketing and advertising.’","Plastic surgeons have warned of the dangers of 'unregulated' skin fillers .

"From the outside it looks like the grim skeletal remains of a once magical castle, but in fact this deserted Chinese replica of Disneyland never opened its doors. What was meant to be ‘the largest amusement park in Asia’, had construction cut short over a decade ago after funding was withdrawn. And now the ruins of ‘Wonderland’ sit in the middle of a 100-acre corn field, just a 45 minute drive from the centre of Beijing. Decaying ruins: The abandoned  building in the shape of a castle stands uncompleted in a field in what would have been an amusement park called 'Wonderland',on the outskirts of Beijing . Work on the potential tourist haven started in 1998 but was halted due to disagreements over property prices with farmers and the local government. Now the farmers that used to own the land have returned to grow their crops once again, with the decaying building site filling the skyline. Photographer David Gray visited the magical kingdom-turned-ghost park and said: ‘Pulling off the express-way and into the car park, I expected to be stopped by the usual confrontational security guards.

"With body beautiful celebrities . adorning the covers of all our favourite magazines, it is no surprise . that we have become a society obsessed with image. And as celebrities become seemingly more slender with every passing day, more of us than ever are turning to liposuction for a helping hand - and that includes celebrities such as Lizzie Cundy and Binky Felstead, who have publicly endorsed new, less invasive forms of fat removal. Now, according to the latest statistics, liposuction has now become the most popular treatment in the world. In demand: According to the latest statistics, liposuction has become the most popular treatment in the world . Figures released this month from the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (ISAPS) reveal that liposuction was the most heavily requested treatment in the world. And it seems that people are so keen to seek out the best possible treatment that they are prepared to travel to find the newest and most effective methods - with London tipped as the best place to come for fat removal. One London clinic has reported a 35 per cent rise in enquiries for their minimally invasive liposuction technique, driven in part by an increase in overseas visitors travelling to the capital for their treatments. In 2012 The Private Clinic on Harley Street experienced a 34.9 per cent increase in enquiries for VASER liposuction and VASER Hi Def – both forms of minimally invasive liposuction – compared to 2011. Famous fans: Made in Chelsea's Binky Felstead had a lipoglaze treatment to target her hips, where she struggled to shift the excess fat . The Private Clinic’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr Mike Comins, believes the trend will continue into 2013, saying: 'In the last few months alone I have treated a number of patients who have flown in from countries such as Sweden, Denmark, Greece, Italy and the Middle East. 'These patients are willing to travel thousands of miles to London, in the knowledge that they will receive the very latest techniques and technologies, delivered by some of the best practitioners in the industry. 'VASER HI DEF, which involves removing fat from around the underlying musculature and thus producing a more sculpted result, is particularly popular with patients from overseas. Freezing the fat: Former WAG Lizzie Cundy is a big fan of the Lipoglaze treatment which can be done on her lunchbreak . 'The number of experienced practitioners offering VASER Hi Def internationally is, relatively speaking, very low and therefore patients seeking the treatment often have no choice but to travel. 'Of course the fact that treatments . such as this can be delivered by specialist practitioners in London, . makes it even more accessible for these international patients. 'The . internet also means that patients can research clinics and doctors from . all over the world, and are therefore not restricted to the expertise . readily available in their own geographical area.' According . to Dr Comins the type of individual expressing an interest in this form . of specialist liposuction technique has also changed: 'Now I see a far . greater number of men coming in for VASER lipo than ever before. Honed to perfection: 54-year-old Donovan underwent a new type of lipo called VASER so that he could keep up with his 33-year-old girlfriend proving how men are fans too . 'And while some five or so years ago the majority of men I treated were in their thirties, now I’m seeing an increasing number of men in their 50s and 60s who, despite leading active, healthy lifestyles, are unable to maintain the bodies that they had when they were younger. 'For these men, VASER helps to ensure that they can continue to look good later into life and they are willing to travel long distances to be treated.'","Figures from the International Society of Aesthetic .

"Cried rape: Beverley Brandreth, 20, has been jailed for claiming her ex-boyfriend raped her twice and he was arrested on both occasions . A woman who falsely cried rape twice against her ex-boyfriend has been jailed. Beverley Brandreth, 20, claimed that he had raped her while she was pregnant which made her lose a baby, a claim which was found to be untrue. At the time prosecutors advised that no charge should be brought against her. Then she made a second claim last November when she told police that he had dragged her into woods where she was beaten unconscious and raped, and he threatened to kill her if she reported the matter. Her lies were unmasked again when the victim later proved he was in a DVD store with his new girlfriend when Brandreth claimed he attacked her. The man she accused was arrested on both occasions and spent a total of 30 hours in custody, Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court heard. He remained on bail for more than two months over the latest alleged offence before Brandreth, of Sharston, Manchester was arrested herself in January. The defendant made no comment and only admitted not telling the truth when she entered a guilty plea in August to attempting to pervert the course of justice. Sentencing her, Judge Bernard Lever said that ‘mercifully’ the accused man had been able to prove his innocence but he told Brandreth she ‘did not know that at the time you made this outrageous allegation against him’. The sentencing comes after a woman . who cried rape because she regretted having sex with three men at a . drunken orgy has been jailed for two years for her ‘wicked’ lies in . September.

"It was the most treasured craft in Britain's possession when the Nazis declared war, but all of the Mk I Sunderland sea planes were thought to be long-lost after being gunned down in WWII. The nation's only long-haul vessel, the 40 Sunderland flying boats were dispatched over the Atlantic Ocean and Germany to keep advancing submarines at bay. But as the Germans upgraded their equipment over the years, the entire fleet was obliterated by being gunned down into the sea. Exciting: This is what historians believe could be the only intact Mark I Sunderland flying-boat in the world as the others were gunned down in the Battle of the Atlantic . Prime: The craft was treasured by the RAF's commanders and Winston Churchill as the only planes that could fly long-haul. They were used to deter German U-boats . But decades on, in 2000, one of the prized crafts has been found wrapped in coral 65ft below the coast of Wales in what historians are touting as one of the most important discoveries this century. And though it is in bits, the thick coating of mud and barnacles have preserved the Sunderland's structure perfectly. Now, 73 years since it sank in 1940, naval historians are on the cusp of finally piecing the unique vessel back together in a project worth half a million pounds. A . deep sea diver accidentally discovered the wreckage after seeing a lobster-pot had become snagged on something below . the waves 13 years ago. The diver followed the rope down to the seabed and came across the world’s only surviving Mark I Sunderland flying-boat. Experts identified the craft as Sunderland T9044 of No 210 Squadron, RAF. Extraction: A major operation is now under way to lift the components out from the Welsh sea bed. Pictured here is a Sunderland propeller being raised onto shore . Last pilot: Wing Commander Derek Martin OBE, pictured left aged 20 in 1940, was the last pilot to fly this Mark I Sunderland when he was training a young aircrew. Now aged 93, Martin is helping the Pembroke Dock Sunderland Trust to identify different parts. He hopes the discovery will make people remember the work those pilots did . Prized: The first were created in 1937 and by 1948 they were already being used by the RAF. Pictured here is a Sunderland taxiing up the slipway at Pembroke Dock in 1943 . To confirm the identity, they tracked down the bomber's last pilot: 93-year-old Wing Commander Derek Martin OBE. Martin . was aged 20 in 1940, training young aircrews, when he flew the . Sunderland out of Pembroke Dock, in West Wales, the day before it sank. He said: 'I flew it on a routine flight around the dock and then moored it up. 'There was a gale during the night and it must have been holed by some floating debris and down it went. 'In the morning it wasn’t there. Well, it was at the bottom of the sea.' Sunderland flying-boats flew out of . Pembroke Dock during the Battle of the Atlantic - when they were used to . attack German U-boats sinking vital supply ships. Newer models were created over time but for the large part of the war, RAF commanders adapted the Mark I Sunderland, which was feared by enemy crafts . Tarnished: Now in pieces and covered in barnacles, historians are desperate to piece it back together to recreate the 1940s state-of-the-art model . Between 1940 and 1943, Winston . Churchill made it repeatedly clear to his troops that he wanted U-boats . to be a priority, writing: '...the only . thing that ever really frightened me during the war was the U-boat . peril.' More than 6,000 RAF aircrew were killed during the Battle of the Atlantic. More than a year before the first prototype was built, the RAF ordered 21 production examples of the Mark I Sunderland flying-boat. With a deeper hull and turrets on the nose and tail, it was a military version of the Empire crafts used by Imperial Airways. Desperate to roll out the new model, the Air Ministry filed an order in 1937 to strengthen defences. The first was received in Singapore in June 1938. By the start of the war, they had a fleet of 40, which acted as one of the major components of the UK's overseas operations for at least the first few months. In total, 75 were built. Initially, it carried 910kg of bombs, mines and other weaponry. A year into the war, amendments were made to combat Nazi tactics. Two Vickers K machine guns were attached to the wing, a second gun was added to the nose turret, and constant speed propellers and deicing boots were installed. Many were kept at Pembroke Docks (above). Martin, . who now lives in the village of Colnbrook, Berkshire, was an instructor . at a training unit based in Pembroke Dock when he last flew the plane . in 1940. Aircrews would have . to fly up to 600 miles out into the Atlantic to escort convoys and . attack German submarines who were slowly starving the British into . submission. They would be . sent out across the oceans to intercept German U-boats using . co-ordinates picked up by the secret codebreakers at Bletchley Park. Having been brought in to work on the 15-year project, Martin became Patron of the Pembroke Dock Sunderland Trust in 2001 and has helped . identify the parts of the plane dive teams have raised from the seabed. The operation costs thousands of pounds, and it was only this year that the Trust managed to extract the front two turrets of the flying-boat. They hope to have the entire vessel extracted and pieced back together in about a year's time. Martin said: 'Sunderlands were the only long range British aircraft which . could reach the middle of the Atlantic for the first couple of years of . the war. 'We would fly out day and night to patrol around the convoys and protect them. 'If . you were lucky you would sink a submarine. But just by being there you . could force submarines to submerge and not get in a position to torpedo . our ships. 'Ships crews would say once they saw us overhead they felt they were safe, which was very nice. 'Everyone . rightly commemorates the sacrifices of Bomber Command airmen but it’s . almost as if our contribution has been forgotten. 'Hopefully this Sunderland will help tell the story of what the crews of the flying-boats did for the nation.' John Evans, who is project manager Pembroke Dock Sunderland Trust, said: 'We now have the world’s only Mark I Sunderland. 'We have identified it as Sunderland T9044 of No 210 Squadron, RAF, which sank at its moorings in a gale in November 1940. 'There was no crew on board and the aircraft was lost for decades before being re-discovered by divers. 'Despite all the years in the water it is immediately recognisable. 'Much of it is covered in mud and sediment - which has preserved the structure and turned it into a perfect time capsule. 'Two of its massive Pegasus radial engines and propellers have been raised from the wreck and are now being conserved and displayed in our museum.' The Pembroke Dock Sunderland Trust was set up to preserve and protect the plane wreck and have begun raising it from the seabed. Mr Evans, who is running the conservation operation, said: 'Derek has visited a number of times and has been a tremendous support to us. 'He piloted this plane and brings that incredible personal link with him - he would’ve heard the engines roar into life all those years ago. Time capsule: The mud and barnacles covering the structure have preserved it. Experts are now matching the propellers they have lifted up with pictures like this . 'Since the plane was first re-discovered around the millennium our volunteers have spent thousands of hours raising the plane in parts. 'This year we have raised a significant part from the turrets at the front of the aircraft and we intend to raise as much as we can from this unique wartime survivor. 'To raise it all is a massive undertaking but we intend to bring up as much as we can by the 75th anniversary of its sinking in 2015.'","Mark I Sunderland was Britain's only long-haul aircraft at start of WWII and used to deter German U-boats .

"A delegation of German visitors on a visit to their British twin town were left shocked when they were greeted at a village wartime festival by revellers dressed in Nazi SS officer uniforms. Members of the 30-strong party from Hamm were horrified to find the villagers donning swastikas and other Nazi regalia during Haworth’s latest 1940s-style celebration. Some visitors to the event, which takes place each year in the small village near Bradford in West Yorkshire, were seen wearing uniforms of the SS - the Third Reich paramilitary organisation responsible for many of the atrocities against humanity in the Second World War. 'Disgrace': Re-enactors sport SS uniforms during last year's 1940s celebration in Haworth, West Yorkshire. German delegates visiting this year's event were shocked when they came face-to-face with similar outfits . 'Offensive': Other visitors wearing Second World War uniforms at last year's event in Haworth. The reaction by the 30-strong German delegation this year has led organisers to ban the wearing of Nazi outfits at future events . Some were wearing the uniform of the 60th Panzer unit, whose outfits included a sinister death head skull. Haworth parish councillor Barry . Thorne, who was acting as a tour guide for the German visitors from . Bradford’s twin town, called for the 'downright disgraceful' uniforms to . be banned at future events. He . said: 'When they first came along the bottom of the street it was like . the parting of the seas and people were looking and thinking ‘what are . they doing?’ You have got to think that at the very least, they are . idiots. 'One visitor said to me that, if that had happened in Germany, they would have been arrested straight away. 'I . think the German people were all just shocked that it was even allowed. They came because they love Bradford and that is something that they . wanted to see.' Setting: The German party were visiting a 1940s festival in the picturesque hilltop village of Haworth . Shadow cast: The delegation went to the 1940s event while visiting Bradford, which is the twinned with their home city of Hamm (pictured) Big disappointment: The Kurhaus hotel in Hamm. Although it was a 1940s event, the delegates were clearly not expecting to come across any Nazi attire . He said he and parish council . chairman Councillor John Huxley confronted the men dressed as SS . officers at last weekend's event and were told it was 'only a bit of fun'. But Councillor Thorne said those wearing the uniforms could be considered to have broken race laws. He . said: 'They were wearing black uniforms and I asked them to leave, the . chairman of the parish council, John Huxley, asked them to leave, and I . understand the police were not happy either. 'It . is not a bit of fun. It is downright disgraceful and should not be . allowed. I think they were in breach of the law by incitement. 'If anybody had been there who had lost family in the Holocaust, they may have been so angry as to take action. Cultural links: The delegates from Hamm, in Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia, came to Bradford because they loved the city, a Haworth parish councillor said . 'It is against the spirit of what the 40s weekend is about and I think it is certainly anti-semitic. 'It is something that we need to deal with next year. We don’t need anything like that.' Nikki Carroll, one of the 20-strong organising committee for the 1940s festival, said it was 'totally against' the wearing of Nazi uniforms. She said: 'We very much want to respect the people that we lost in the war and would totally discourage anybody wearing the Nazi uniform and swastikas. 'We did ask people who were wearing swastikas if they could possible remove them and ask people to be more respectful but it is difficult because it is up to them what they do or not. 'As a committee, we need to look a bit more into what we can do about it next year.'","30-strong party left horrified after running into villagers donning SS outfits .

"A city in the Philippines has been named the selfie capital of the world today. According to research, Makati City, one of the 16 cities that make up Metro Manilla, produces more self portraits per capita than any other city in the world. Time magazine examined hundreds of thousands of selfies and found the city has 258 self-proclaimed selfie takers per every 100,000 people. The world map of selfies, according to research carried out by Time Magazine . It found Manhattan produces the second highest number of selfies per capita - although a huge percentage will be tourists. Miami is the third selfiest city, followed by Anaheim and Santa Ana, California, and Petaling Jaya, Malaysia. Time ranked 459 cities in terms of selfie takers by looking at Instagram photos that included both the hashtag 'selfie' and the geographic coordinates. The more than 400,000 photos used to make the database were taken between January 28 and February 2 or March 3 to 7. The magazine said each day's data consists of the 24-hour period from midnight to midnight to account for all time zones equally. Time said: 'For every city in the world of at least 250,000 residents, we then counted the number of selfies taken within five miles and divided by the population of that city. The selfie map for Europe, that shows Manchester in the UK has 114 taken per 100,000 people .

'While the metric of 'people who take selfies per capita' is far from a perfect measure, it was far and away the most comprehensive means of comparing the 459 world cities that turned up at least 25 individual users in the database. 'Of course, this measure bakes in more variables than just a penchant for selfies, such as smart phone adoption rates and median income.

"Nearly half of children have reached the age of 11 without using public transport - and most children now have mobile phones . Today's children are so cosseted that nearly half have never set foot on a bus or train, a major study reveals today. The research paints a picture of a gadget-obsessed generation who spend hours in front of screens but enjoy limited freedom. It found 48 per cent had reached the age of 11 without ever travelling on public transport – even with an adult. But more than one in six spent at least three hours a day watching television or DVDs on a computer. For the most heavily addicted, the daily time spent in front of a screen could add up to seven hours. The findings come from the state-funded Millennium Cohort Study, which is tracking 13,000 British children born in 2000, 2001 or 2002. A snapshot taken when the participants were 11 shows the extent to which childhoods have changed in half a generation. Three-quarters now have their own mobile phone and six in ten have a television in their bedroom. Contact with friends is just as likely to be via technology – either mobile phone calls or social networking sites – as it is to be face-to-face. ‘Social media undoubtedly plays a central role in the lives of most of these children,’ the study said. ‘With the evolution of social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, friends have become redefined as not only those they see but virtual friends. ‘Communication with many of them exists solely in a virtual world.’ Despite this, not all children were constantly using social media. The study found 46 per cent of boys and 31 per cent of girls never messaged their friends. Researchers asked parents were how much freedom they gave their children to make journeys on their own around the local area. ‘The survey clearly showed the ever-greater reliance on the family car for all journeys,’ the report said. ‘Very few children had travelled on public transport on their own (four per cent), while a surprisingly high proportion (48 per cent) had never even travelled on public transport with an adult.’ More than one in six spent at least three hours a day watching television or on a computer, a study revealed . Just over half of boys and 44 per cent of girls were allowed to make journeys on their own on foot. Boys were also more likely to be allowed to play unsupervised with their friends. Fifty-one per cent said they did so most weekends compared to 43 per cent of girls. Around a quarter of parents did not allowed their children any unsupervised time with friends. The study also shed light on tensions within the family. Twenty-nine per cent of parents said they had ‘frequent battles’ with their 11-year-old. And around one in ten disciplined their children by sending them to their bedrooms or denying them treats. Previous research has suggested the emergence of a ‘sensible’ generation. The Millennium Cohort Study echoed these findings, saying the behaviour of 11-year-olds ‘was giving little cause for concern’. Seventy-six per cent said they had been bullied by a sibling and 58 per cent reported being picked on by another child. But around half – 52 per cent – rated themselves as being ‘completely happy’.","48% of children reached age of 11 without travelling on public transport .

"As a turkey hunter for the last 24 years, Washington County sheriff's commander Jerry Cusick never thought for a moment he would go from hunter to the hunted while walking the woods of western Wisconsin on Tuesday. In mere seconds he had approximately 50 BBs from a shotgun sprayed into his face, chest and arms, taking out a front tooth and lodging one pellet behind his eye. Mr Cusick, 53, collapsed to the ground covered in blood and cried out to whoever was upon him, but says he heard no reply back. Jerry Cusick was shot in his face, chest and arms while walking a private wooded path on Tuesday . Cusick, 53, said it was a miracle he was able to drive himself to safety and can see out of both eyes . Cusick is covered in bruises and wounds from where a shotgun sprayed him approximately 50 times by accused hunter Anthony Cardarelli, 27 . 'It spun me around, knocked my hat off,' he told the Mohr Pioneer Press on Wednesday. 'I ducked down and saw blood was streaming down. I screamed, ""You shot me! You shot me!"" 'I would liken it to somebody hitting you upside the head with a baseball bat, and you didn't expect it was coming,' he said. Mr Cusick, who has served 28-years with the sheriff's office and also teaches classes on turkey hunting safety, was scouting private land in St. Croix County for an upcoming turkey hunt when hit. He says he doesn't know the shooter, identified as 27-year-old Anthony Cardarelli of White Bear Lake, and isn't sure whether the man was trespassing on the land or firing from off the property. All that confusion is what led him to immediately fear for his life. 'I thought, ""I'm not going to die here. ...I'm getting out of here,'"" he recalled. Mr Cusick got up from the path he was walking on and drove himself to a nearby farm before he was transported to Regions Hospital in St Paul. Miracle survival: Wisconsin sheriff's commander Jerry Cusick, 53, seen on a recent turkey hunting trip to Nebraska received a spray of pellets, also called BBs, across his face, arms and chest . 'There is no information at this point that Cardarelli intended to shoot a person,' St. Croix County Sheriff John Shilts told CBS WCCO. 'However, I have great concern over the fact that Cardarelli did not properly identify his intended target prior to shooting.' The firearm used was originally misreported as a BB gun with the shotgun's pellets commonly referred as both. An investigation is currently underway into the incident which is believed to have been an accident. Mr Cardarelli is said to be an experienced turkey hunter according to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. ‘In talking with him, he has been an avid turkey hunter for years,’ Dave Hausman, a warden supervisor with the department told the Pioneer Press. He’s also being credited for immediately calling 911 after Mr Cusick was injured. Yet his handling of the situation after the fact doesn’t help earn Mr Cusick’s forgiveness for what happened in the moments immediately before. Investigation: Mr Cusick, seen here in 2007, says he was scouting private land for an upcoming turkey hunt when he was aggressively shot on a wooded path . Weapon: The firearm used was a shotgun, a typical one shown, which in a single shot sent the spray of pellets into Mr Cusick as he walked along a path . 'I'm very disappointed in people, especially this shooter,' Mr Cusick said. 'I mean, how could you? ... The fact is, he made a very, very poor choice. It was an unconscionable choice to shoot without identifying what he was shooting at.' Mr Cusick has since been discharged from the hospital badly scarred while still requiring surgery for that one pellet still lodged behind his eye. He calls it a 'miracle' that he not only walked away with his life from can still see out of both eyes. Still, 'I'm going to have to live with 50 pellet scars all over my face and body,' he said. Those injuries and the ordinarily haunting experience won't stop him from hunting turkeys, however, with Mr Cusick’s hunting season permit having started on Wednesday. On Monday he says he also plans to return to work at the sheriff’s department. 'Obviously, I can't go out and fight with anybody, but I can do my administrative work,’ he said. Discharged: Mr Cusick has since been discharged from the hospital while still requiring surgery for one pellet still lodged behind his eye but planning to return to work soon and continue hunting .","Wisconsin sheriff's commander Jerry Cusick was shot in his face, chest and arms while walking a private wooded path on Tuesday .

"A stunned homeowner has filmed himself setting fire to highly flammable water gushing from his bathroom tap. In the clip uploaded to YouTube, Jacob Haughney produces a intensely bright yellow fireball to erupt from a flowing tap by putting a lighter flame to the liquid. Mr Haughney, who works on oil fields near his home in North Dakota, discovered the worrying phenomenon while in the shower. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Spark: Jacob Haughney puts a lighter to his tap water, left, almost instantly igniting a bright yellow flame, right . 'Just found out something out about the tap water we bathe in and that we use to brush our teeth and it's pretty weird,' he said. He added: 'First time I did it there was a huge fireball - took up the entire sink - so that's why I'm a little jumpy going it. I don't want to blow up the bathroom.' Shock: Jacob Haughney, pictured, discovered his tap water is flammable . His video has been viewed more than 237,000 times since being uploaded to YouTube just over a week ago. It has been speculated that the explosive tap water is the result of oil drilling nearby - specifically if it has anything to with hydraulic . fracturing, which is popularly known as 'fracking'. This . is the process by which natural gas is extracted by using water, sand . and toxic chemicals injected at high pressure into oil of methane gas . deposits to fracture the rock above and release the liquid or gas below. Fracking involves releasing natural . gas trapped in shale formations by blasting a mix of water, sand and . chemicals into the rock. It has unlocked reserves that could . supply the U.S. for 100 years, although environmentalists say that . fracking can contaminate water supplies. North Dakota, which is home to just . 700,000 people, is the centre of a fracking boom. It . is now the second largest oil-producing state in America, producing . more than 911,000 barrels a day - largely due to the use of fracking . technology. Flammable: The fireball bursts up the running water and over Jacob Haughney's hand within split seconds . Explosive: A stunned Jacob Haughney realises he has been bathing in and brushing his teeth with this water . Campaigners against fracking have previously documented flammable water. Invented in 1949, hydraulic fracking involves drilling more than 7,000ft down into gas-bearing shale before pumping a mixture of water and sand at high pressure into the shale, causing tiny fractures which allow long-term release of gas. In the US large-scale fracking since 2005 has caused energy prices to plummet, sparked economic recovery and cut greenhouse gas emissions to levels last seen in 1990. However, survey by the Pew Research Center showed the public’s growing anxiety over fracking. Almost half (49 per cent) of those polled in a recent survey opposed the increased use of fracking — up from 38 per cent people in a similar survey in March — while 44 per cent were in favour. The skepticism comes as the industry is making concerted efforts to change the ingredients used in fracking fluids and focusing on recycling the water it consumes. In . 2012, activist Sherry Vargson, from Granville Township, Pennsylvania, . produced a video of her lighing water flowing from her kitchen tap. Vargson . and the 'Gas Drilling Awareness Coalition' claimed the water has become . flammable because of increased methane levels in the surrounding rock . which had been disturbed by the controversial fracking activity. While . Pennsylvania regulators did fine the Chesapeake energy Corp $900,000 . for contaminating the water supplies of 16 homes in Bradford County with . methane, there has been no conclusive evidence that fracking was to . blame. But one commenter on Mr Haughney's video insisted there could be other reasons for the flames. YouTube user shorefisherman said: 'It's completely natural, and is very common here in rural North Dakota where many people have a private well for their water source. 'Many aquifers out here are what we call ""gassy wells"" there's areas underground where natural gasses like methane are trapped in the ground with the water and bubble up the plumbing when you turn a faucet on. 'Been that way long before fracking ever started in this state﻿.'","Jacob Haughney, of North Dakota, saw flames erupting from bathroom tap .

"Pre-op: Paris Green, who was born Peter Laing, has been . moved from Scotland's only women's prison after he allegedly had sex . with fellow inmates . A pre-op transsexual locked up in a women's jail for a savage torture-killing has been moved to a different prison after claims he was having sex with female inmates. Murderer Paris Green, 22, who was previously known as Peter Laing, was allowed to serve his 18-year sentence in Cornton Vale women’s prison, in Stirling, because he says he is transgendered. But today it emerged he has been moved amid suspicions that he was involved in casual-sex relationships with other convicts there. Green was sent to the prison only five . weeks ago after he was found guilty, alongside Kevin McDonagh, 23, and . Dean Smith, 20, of the murder of Robert Shankland in March this year. The . trio had invited Mr Shankland, 45, to a party in Green's flat in the . central Scotland town of Glenrothes. There he was tied up, beaten and . tortured for hours before finally being murdered. Despite . a campaign by Mr Shankland's parents, Mary and Ian Bell, Green was told . he could serve his sentence in a women's prison prior to . taxpayer-funded gender realignment surgery. Now . after his dalliances with fellow convicts at Cornton Vale, he is to be . kept in the women's section of Edinburgh's Saughton jail. Mrs . Bell, 69, said yesterday: 'It doesn't make any difference where he is . to me. He's in the women's bit of the jail and he's still a man. 'There's no point in campaigning because it's not going to get us anywhere. There's not much we can do now.' Mrs Bell added she was not prejudiced against transgender individuals. Mr Shankland's Stepfather 79-year-old Mr Bell, said: 'The law's a farce. It doesn't give society any protection.'

"A Spring Break vacation in Florida ended in tragedy when a 62-year-old father of three fell to his death from a hotel balcony while chaperoning his daughter and her friends. Thomas Saunders, a veteran American Airlines pilot from Southlake, Texas, was pronounced dead at the scene outside Holiday Inn Resort in Panama City Beach Wednesday. Saunders' daughter Rachel Saunders and her four friends were sleeping in their hotel room when the 62-year-old man plummeted from a 12-story terrace. Tragic death: American Airlines captain Thomas Saunders, 62, was killed when he fell from a hotel balcony while chaperoning his daughter's Spring Break trip to Florida . Beach getaway: Saunders' 18-year-old daughter tweeted this image of Holiday Inn Resort in Panama City Beach where the group had been staying since last Sunday . Police do not suspect foul play. According to hotel management, the deadly fall was caused by a medical emergency and was not alcohol- or drug-related, the Star Telegram reported. An autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death. Police were called to the hotel on Front Beach Road at around 9.30am Wednesday after getting reports about a balcony fall. Mr Saunders' lifeless body was discovered on the roof of the atrium. ‘All I could see was the shape of a body under the cloth,’ hotel guest Andrew Rulesh told The News Herald. ‘But it was pretty disturbing.’ Best friends: Rachel Saunders (right) went on vacation with her four friends, with her father (left) and his girlfriend acting as chaperones . Unbreakable bond: A devastated Miss Saunders shared this touching photo of her as a little girl in her father's arms . Struggling to copse: The 18-year-old woman has been tweeting about her loss since her father's deadly fall . Panama City Beach Police Capt. Robert Clarkson said Saunders and his girlfriend were in town to keep an eye on his 18-year-old daughter, Rachel, and her friends. According to his Facebook page, Mr Saunders, a graduate of Purdue University, spent 36 years flying commercial jets for American Airlines. Under Federal Aviation Administration rules, Mr Saunders still had three years to go until reaching the mandatory retirement age of 65. Rachel Saunders, a student at St Teresa's Academy in Kansas City, Missouri, expressed her shock and heartbreak on her Twitter page. 'I can't believe this... It doesn't even feel real,' she tweeted just hours after the tragedy. Cause of death: The management of the Florida hotel said the fall was related to a medical issue rather than alcohol or drugs . Later in the day, she added: 'I didn't know it was possible to feel this heartbroken.' Mr Saunders and the spring breakers arrived in Panama City Beach last Sunday and were supposed to stay for a week. On the first day of their vacation, his daughter posted several enthusiastic messages saying how much she loved the resort town, and she even shared a photo showing the ocean view from her room. Besides Rachel, Mr Saunders is survived by two older daughters and at least two grandchildren. In his free time, Saunders raced autocross cars as part of the Texas Region SCCA solo program. World Racing League posted on their Facebook page Thursday that the 62-year-old was a 12-time SCCA solo national champion. 'Always friendly and outgoing, always available to walk the course with novices or ride along with those looking to shave another 10th of a second, Tommy was one of those racers everyone liked and looked up to ,' the online tribute read.","Thomas Saunders, a father of three from Texas, was pronounced dead at Holiday Inn Resort in Panama City Beach, Florida .

They are being removed at a rate of 75,000 a day to be shipped to buyers who have paid £25 per flower, raising millions for charity. Mr Cummins said none had been stolen. ‘When they were taken out of the moat, people were breaking into the lorries to try to get them,’ he said. ‘I am not happy. ‘It is disrespectful to the people who bought them and made them and to the people they represent.’ Auction site eBay banned sales of the poppies earlier this month when buyers listed them online – at more than double the £25 price – while they were still on display. But as the poppies have been removed from the moat and are beginning to be dispatched to their new owners, thieves have targeted the vans where they are being held.

Mr Cummins said yesterday: ‘When they were taken out of the moat, people were breaking into the lorries to try to get them. ‘They have been trying to do this ever since we put them in. ‘So many people want them but we are not making any more, because I thought it would be disrespectful to the people who died.’ Mr Cummins said that ‘hundreds of thousands of people’ still wanted to purchase a poppy. In remembrance: The artwork, designed by Paul Cummins, was inspired by an unknown soldier from his home town who wrote a poem which begins 'The blood swept lands and seas of red, / Where angels dare to tread' The stunning scene at the Tower of London has attracted millions of visitors and was extended for a further two weeks after a campaign by the Mail. A spokesman for Mr Cummins confirmed last night that none of the poppies had been successfully taken. A Historic Royal Palaces spokeswoman said: ‘All appropriate security measures have been in place throughout the project to ensure the safe delivery of the poppies to their new owners. ‘An attempt was made to break into empty vehicles at a rest stop on their way to London.

"Hot shot: British thriller writer Lee Child in New York . He is one of the world’s biggest-selling thriller writers, with his Jack Reacher novels so successful one is bought every two seconds. Now author Lee Child has admitted he keeps his writing razor-sharp by working while high on cannabis and even claims that it should be made compulsory. ‘I’ve been smoking weed for 44 years, five nights a week,’ the author confessed. ‘I’m the poster boy to prove it doesn’t do you much harm. ‘I have a guy on speed dial in New . York who comes over with a huge range of marijuana. I smoke it in a pipe . because I’ve never been any good at rolling my own joints.’ Child . was brought up in Birmingham and moved to America in 1999 after he . published the first of his Reacher novels, of which he has now sold . 70 million. The latest, Never Go Back, comes out on August 28 and is his 18th. Last year, Tom Cruise starred in the movie Jack Reacher. The books, all revenge-themed, have brought huge material success to this British author with an all-American hero. Reacher, a former soldier, roams the country, uncovering wrongdoing and dispensing rough justice, before drifting off again. His life is so stripped down that he . doesn’t own a change of clothes. Something of an enigma, he has much in . common with his 58-year-old creator who, despite his wealth, leads a . spartan life. The kitchen . cupboards of Child’s Manhattan apartment are bare: no food, no cooking . equipment, because he exists mostly on coffee and marijuana. ‘I am . indifferent to food,’ he said. ‘I have to eat, obviously, but I work . better when I am hungry.’ Child – who is wafer-thin and 6ft 5in – went on: ‘And the weed, well, that’s part of the diet. I was 14 when I smoked my first joint. That was when I had sex for the first time, too. Then I had sex for the second time. With the first girl’s sister. Anti-hero: Child's stories of Jack Reacher are so popular that Tom Cruise played the former soldier in box office hit Jack Reacher last year . ‘It was April 1969. I remember it well. I was in bed with a girl and her sister came in and joined us. It was a fantastic weekend. Not something easily forgotten. Although I’m sure those two girls have long forgotten me.’ By way of explanation, he added: ‘It was the 1960s.’ Child’s own story reads like a rags- to-riches cliche. After 18 years as a presentation director at Granada Television, he was abruptly made redundant in 1995, at 40, after a spell as a union activist. Blacklisted for ‘guerrilla’ union tactics and flat broke, Child wrote his first Reacher novel in long-hand because he couldn’t afford a computer. ‘It wasn’t a hobby,’ he says wryly. ‘Frankly we were in the s***. I had to find a new profession. And fast.’ His debut novel, Killing Floor, was an instant success. Its theme of revenge was doubtless not lost on his former employers. Bestseller: Lee Child's A Wanted Man is one of his Jack Reacher books that have sold 70million . It was, he says, his way of letting Granada know how angry he was. ‘Fiction is always autobiographical. I wanted to break the legs of certain people  at Granada.’ He now spends most of his time in America, where marijuana use is not considered a serious criminal offence. A first infringement entails a fine of about £65, but arrests are rare. Meanwhile, his wife Jane, a New Yorker, has chosen to live 3,500 miles away in Sussex, visiting several times a year. ‘I enjoy being anonymous,’ he  confided. ‘I have sat next to people on aeroplanes who were reading  one of my books but I have never introduced myself. ‘A fellow author once saw a man reading one of his books and asked what he thought of it. The man replied, “It’s s*** but it was the only thing I could get at the airport.” Need I say more?’ And he insists Reacher is the star, not him. ‘When anyone walks into  a bookshop, they ask for the new Reacher, not the new Lee Child.’ He also firmly believes ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’ and doesn’t foresee switching his books to Britain. ‘People have a perception of places,’ he explains. ‘They think London is full of bobbies in pointy black hats. The reality is that it is full of cops in flak jackets with machine guns. ‘The only time I have ever seen a gun fired to try to kill someone was in Manchester. I was driving to work one afternoon when two gangs in a drugs war started shooting over the top of my car. 'I ran a red light and b******d off. I’ve never seen guns used like that in America.’","British thriller writer Lee Child admits he writes while high on cannabis .

"Celebrities, MPs and charities have joined the backlash against the latest Band Aid single, claiming it ‘patronises’ Africa. As the new version of Do They Know It’s Christmas? reached number one in the charts, the furore over its controversial lyrics grew. Lily Allen and Emeli Sande are the latest musicians to criticise the song, which aims to raise millions of pounds to help fight the ebola crisis in West Africa. Some say the lyrics are outdated and perpetuate negative stereotypes of African countries which could harm their world image. Scroll down for video . Lily Allen (left) and Emeli Sande are the latest musicians to criticise the song, which aims to raise millions of pounds to help fight the ebola crisis in West Africa . Miss Sande, who was one of only three black musicians to take part in the new single, praised the sentiment behind the project but said ‘a whole new’ song was needed. The 27-year-old, who has Zambian heritage, said on Twitter both she and Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo ‘made and sang our own edits’, and it was ‘unfortunate’ none made the cut. She added: ‘I apologise if the lyrics of the song have caused offence. I wish the changes had been kept but that is out of my control.’ Lily Allen also said yesterday she refused to take part in the project because she felt there was ‘something smug about it’. She added: ‘I prefer to do my charitable bit by donating actual money and not being lumped in with a bunch of people like that.’ Blur frontman Damon Albarn also appeared to criticise the project, saying ‘really sometimes, giving money creates another problem’. He added: ‘Our perspective and our idea of what helps and our idea [of] what’s wrong and right are not necessarily shared by other cultures.’ Stellar line-up: Band Aid 30 artists have recorded a new version of the song Do They Know It's Christmas? Damon Albarn (left) appeared to criticise the project and Sir Malcolm Bruce MP told BBC Radio 4: ‘Africa isn’t a country' No go: Adele 'ignored' Bob Geldof's pleas to sing on the Band Aid 30 Christmas charity single . Fuse ODG says he pulled out of recording the Band Aid 30 charity single because he feels it's a quick fix to a larger problem. He also criticised some of the lyrics . The single, which features stars including One Direction, U2 frontman Bono and Ellie Goulding, was originally released in 1984 to raise money to fight famine in Ethiopia. Critics said it was inappropriate to use the same song – brought to public attention once more by its original creators, Sir Bob Geldof and Midge Ure – for a different crisis. It has also been pointed out that many of those affected by ebola are Muslim and do not celebrate Christmas. Others complained the song’s revised lyrics, which include the line ‘there’s death in every tear’, paint Africa in a negative light. Sir Malcolm Bruce MP, chairman of the International Development Select Committee and deputy Lib Dem leader, told BBC Radio 4: ‘Africa isn’t a country, it’s a continent with many different countries with many different challenges. Sir Bob Geldof, 63, (pictured with Midge Ure) has called claims the song is patronising a ‘complete load of b*******’ ‘There’s a danger that this kind of appeal is slightly patronising and gives the impression that Africa doesn’t have the capacity to do things for itself.’ Solome Lemma, co-founder of Africans in the Diaspora and the Africa Responds initiative on ebola, told Al Jazeera the original song ‘created misconceptions about Ethiopia in a patronising way’. And Dawit Gebreselassie, 26, a financial analyst from Ethiopia, joked: ‘I would ask, does Geldof know when it’s Christmas time in Ethiopia? ‘Perhaps the fact that we celebrate Christmas a few weeks later on January 7 could have misled him into thinking we don’t know when it is. ‘Reassure him from us that, after his last three reminders, we are well aware and don’t need any more prompting.’ Despite the backlash, the single has sold 312,000 copies since its release last week.

"A lone gunman boarded a school bus, shooting dead its driver, and taking a six-year-old passenger hostage, authorities revealed Tuesday. The shooter, cited by many news sources to be 65-year-old Jimmy Lee Dykes, has barricaded himself in a bunker-like structure in his back yard, and continues to hold the child hostage. The Dothan Eagle reports that Dykes was supposed to appear in court on Wednesday for a bench trial over a menacing charge. A suspect, identified as Jimmy Lee Dykes, 65, allegedly held up a school bus Tuesday in Midland City, Alabama, shooting dead the bus driver and taking a boy hostage . Emergency vehicles flocked around the area as investigators tried to negotiate the hostage situation . Dykes’ neighbor, James Edward Davis Jr told the paper that the man pointed a gun at him and his daughter in December, saying that they had driven into his yard. The Dale County Sheriff confirmed that a man shot the driver in Midland City on Tuesday. Children on the bus said that the man who boarded the bus told most of the students to get off. They then said that the man shot the bus driver several times. The driver later died of his wounds. His identity wasn't immediately released. uthorities say the shooter took the child to an area behind nearby Destiny Church. WSFA reported that bomb squads were called to the scene, though there was no sign of explosive devices. The shooting comes at a time when gun violence in schools is on everyone's mind, nearly two months after the Sandy Hook Elementary School schooting . Residents in the immediate area were also evacuated as a precaution. Midland City police would not comment, and a call to the Dale City Sheriff's office was not answered Tuesday. However, it was reported that members of a SWAT team are communicating with the suspect in his bunker via a PVC pipe. The shooting comes as the nation is on edge about gun violence, especially in schools, after a gunman shot dead 20 students and six staff members at a Connecticut elementary school last month, stoking a national debate on gun control. The sheriff's department said multiple agencies were assisting with the incident and local area schools would be closed on Wednesday.","Gunman, identified as Jimmy Lee Dykes, 65, allegedly shot dead bus driver and took boy, 6, hostage .

"On 9 July this year, the internet will suddenly 'turn off' for thousands of users around the world. Around 350,000 PC users have machines infected with an invisible, undetectable 'Trojan' computer virus called DNSChanger, which sends users of the Web to unintended - and sometimes illegal - sites. When the FBI detected the infection they set up 'surrogate' servers to keep the infected PCs working - but it's costing so much that they intend to 'pull the plug' on 9 July. Around 350,000 PC users have machines infected with an invisible, undetectable 'Trojan' computer virus sending users to unintended and illegal sites . Infected: The Trojan 'DNSChanger' could cause millions - including Fortune 500 companies - to lose their Internet if the FBI shuts down surrogate servers . Court order: The FBI will retire their surrogate servers by March 8 . 'If we just pulled the plug on their criminal infrastructure, the victims were going to be without internet service,' said Tom Grasso, an FBI agent talking to Fox News. According to RT Network, servers function by translating traditional website URLs to their ‘numeric counterpart.’ But computers with the Trojan, which originally emerged in Estonia, will send users to fraudulent websites. And, if the FBI shuts off their emergency servers, millions of people could potentially be without Internet. The temporary servers set up by the FBI were created to allow companies to remove the worm from their infected servers; those affected had 120 days to get rid of the malware. After FBI warnings, the number of PCs infected with the Trojan has plunged - and most are in the hands of private individuals, not companies. Of the 350,000 infected machines worldwide, 85,000 are in the U.S and 20,000 are in the UK. Ticking clock: The FBI's surrogate servers can run until March 8, at which point they will either have to be shut down or run by a court-ordered extension . The malware is especially effective, Gizmodo reports, because it blocks infected users from visiting secure sites that could help them rid of the worm. Law enforcement officials and the computer industry have been working together in a coalition to fight the malware. The group, called the DNSChanger Working Group, will examine possibilities to fixing the problem. If no solution is reached, millions of people could be without the Internet, RT reports.","Machines infected with virus being 'kept alive' by FBI .

"Scientists believe they are a step closer to understanding why we like a gentle touch. A new study claims to have isolated the specific class of sensory cells in the skin that respond to a gentle caress. Social animals, from humans to cats, all seem to enjoy being stroked, but until now the neuronal circuitry underlying the sensation had been a mystery. Feels good: Scientists claim to have finally isolated the class of sensory cells in the skin that respond to a gentle caress, shedding light on why it is that humans and other animals find stroking so pleasurable . The skin is a human being's largest sensory organ, helping to distinguish between a pleasant contact, like a caress, and a negative sensation, like a pinch or a burn. Previous studies have shown that these sensations are carried to the brain by different types of sensory neurons that have nerve endings in the skin. Only a few of those neuron types have been identified, however, and most of those detect painful stimuli. Now biologists at the California Institute of Technology have identified in mice a specific class of skin sensory neurons that reacts to an apparently pleasurable stimulus. 'We've known a lot about the neurons that detect things that make us hurt or feel pain, but we've known much less about the identity of the neurons that make us feel good when they are stimulated,' said lead researcher David Anderson, Seymour Benzer Professor of Biology at Caltech. 'Generally it's a lot easier to study things that are painful because animals have evolved to become much more sensitive to things that hurt or are fearful than to things that feel good. 'Showing a positive influence of something on an animal model is not that easy.' The Caltech team did not set out to explain the pleasure of stroking. They were investigating a type of sensory cell discovered in 2007, the purpose of which had not yet been ascertained. To do this, the researchers bred genetically modified mice with fluorescent molecular markers attached to the neurons which lit up when the particular cells were activated. They also opened a tiny hole along the spine of the GM mice that they could peer through with a high-powered microscope to see when the cells lit up. 'We took advantage of the fact that these sensory neurons are bipolar in the sense that they send one branch into the skin that detects stimuli, and another branch into the spinal cord to relay the message detected in the skin to the brain,' Professor Anderson said. Painstaking: Researchers bred genetically modified mice with fluorescent markers that lit up when the neurons they were investigating were activated, then treated the animals to a range of different stimuli . Through a painstaking process of applying stimuli to one tiny area of the animal's body at a time, they found that these particular neurons lit up only when stroked. But the Caltech team could not be sure if the massage-like stimulus they were giving the mice was pleasurable to the mice in the way it would be to humans. 'As scientists we can't just assume that because something feels good to us, it has to also feel good to an animal,' said the professor. 'So we then had to design an experiment to show that artificially activating just these neurons — without actually stroking the mouse — felt good to the mouse.' To do this the researchers built a maze with left, right, and centre rooms which were different enough that a mouse could distinguish them through smell, sight, and touch. In the left room, the mouse received an injection of a drug that selectively activated the neurons shown to detect massage-like stroking. In the room on the right, the mouse received a control injection of saline. After a few sessions in each outer room, the animal was placed in the centre, with the doors open to see which room it preferred. It clearly favoured the room where the massage-sensitive neurons were activated. The findings: This graph shows the increases in fluorescence as a stroke stimulus was applied to the mice. The vertical yellow bars indicate the periods when the stimulus was applied . Professor Anderson said this was the first time anyone has used this type of conditioned place-preference experiment to show that activating certain neurons in the skin can actually make an animal feel good. He hopes his team's findings and the new methods they developed will allow researchers to trace the circuitry from those neurons up into the brain to ask why and how activating these neurons leads to pleasure. 'We are now most interested in how these neurons communicate to the brain through circuits,' he said. 'In other words, what part of the circuit in the brain is responsible for the good feeling that is apparently produced by activating these neurons? 'It may seem frivolous to be identifying massage neurons in a mouse, but it could be that some good might come out of this down the road.'","Social animals from humans to cats all seem to enjoy being stroked, but until now the neurobiology behind it had been a mystery .
Caltech team genetically modify mice so certain neurons fluoresced when activated then stroked, poked and prodded them .
They found a certain class that activated only in response to strokes and conducted a second experiment to determine it was indeed pleasurable ."
"A banker is suing her former sex discrimination lawyer who she says advised her 'to start crying' the next time she had a meeting with her boss. Hedge fund manager Celia Elizabeth Farnon wants millions in damages from law firm Devonshires because of bad advice she claims was given by her lawyer, Nicola Philp. Ms Farnon says she approached the law firm after her former employers, investment management company Polar Capital LLP, clipped her yearly bonus by 95 per cent from £800,000 to £36,615. 'Bad advice': Sex discrimination lawyer Nicola Philp, left, and former client Celia Farnon outside the High Court in London for the first day of the hearing . She claims that, when she complained to her boss in May 2008, she was suspended. Now she is asking Mr Justice Owen at the High Court in London to award her damages 'in the low millions' against the law firm, claiming they bungled her sex discrimination claim. Richard Leiper representing Ms Farnon put documents before the judge spelling out her discrimination claim. He said: 'Ms Farnon felt she had been paid less than men in a comparable position to her own. 'She also referred to the sex discriminatory environment in which she had been working.' High Court battle: Celia Farnon wants millions from law firm Devonshires who is defending the action . In the witness box, Ms Farnon told the judge that Ms Philp, a partner in Devonshires, 'told (her) to start crying,' next time she met her boss, when she brought her problems to her. Ms Farnon's employers allege she committed 'breaches' by colluding with a competitor. Ms Farnon, who currently lives in Hong Kong, told the judge from the witness box: 'I was told by Miss Philp I was in a very weak position and, as I had a job lined up, there would be no chance of damages for future losses, and that there was basically no room to negotiate. She told me that the claim would be limited to £50,000. 'I trusted her. She had been recommended to me as an expert on sexual discrimination,' she added. Andrew Short QC, for Devonshires, said that 'everything is in dispute' about Ms Farnon's claim, including what was said between her and the lawyers and what level of bonus she could reasonably have expected. Cross-examining Ms Farnon, he alleged that it 'hadn't occurred to her' at the time of the meeting with Ms Philp to claim an £800,000 bonus, and that she had sketched out a much more modest £50-70,000 claim. Mr Short said that Ms Farnon's primary concern when she came to Devonshires had been for them to find her 'leverage' in order to be able to leave her job for another one at short notice, rather than launch a massive sex discrimination claim. 'It only occurred to you after you entered into the compromise agreement with Polar Capital LLP,' he told her. Mr Short also denied Ms Farnon had been told to start crying in her next meeting with then boss, John Mansell, the Chief Operating Officer of Polar LLP. 'You were not told to start crying at the meeting with Mr Mansell. Miss Philp did not advise you to do that,' he said. 'Miss Philp did,' Ms Farnon replied. The hearing, set to last for five days, continues.","Court hears hedge fund manager's annual bonus was slashed from £800,000 to £36,000 sparking complaint .

"A super-fast '4G' mobile network could be available in the UK this year - but the new iPad might not work with the British network. Phone company Everything Everywhere has submitted an application to Ofcom to use its existing 1800MHz 'slice' of mobile spectrum to deliver 4G services in the UK. But it's a slightly different frequency to the U.S. networks the new iPad is built to work on - and it's not clear whether Apple will update its tablet to work with the UK's network. Olaf Swantee, CEO at Everything Everywhere, said earlier this year, ¿Everything Everywhere¿s vision is to launch 4G for Britain as soon as possible.'

Other operators have four weeks to submit their views, Ofcom says. Everything Everywhere is to run trials of the technology in Bristol and Cornwall - and says it is spending £1.4 million a year on researching 4G. The company says that the new iPad may not work with either the 1800HMz network to launch before the end of 2012 - or Britain's upcoming 'real' 4G network. ‘Apple’s published facts on the new iPad . suggest that the its 4G capabilities are fixed to 700MHz and 2.1GHz . spectrum frequencies, which are the ones used in the US and Canada for . 4G connectivity.

"A retired diver has opened his very own Davy Jones-style locker of hundreds of nautical treasures he has salvaged from the seabed. Ray Ives, 77, has spent 40 years amassing a huge trove of historical artifacts that he has found during thousands of deep sea dives off the British coast. His collection includes canon balls, muskets, swords and even the bell from an ocean liner sunk by a German U-boat in the First World War.

For years Mr Ives had stuffed his collection into a tiny shed in the back garden of his home in Plymouth, Devon. But now the fascinating archive has gone on display to the public in a ramshackle museum made from shipping containers. The directors of Yacht Haven Quay in Plymouth set up the makeshift museum for Mr Ives to house his spoils plundered from the seas off Devon and Cornwall. The ecclectic collection has been dubbed ‘Ray's Plaice' and is billed as a 'museum of dive treasures'. The museum also boasts 19th Century bottles, propellers, coins, portholes, ammunition boxes, tools, bayonets and glass bottles.

"The U.S. handed opponents of Colonel Gaddafi over to Libya with only thin 'diplomatic assurances' that they would not be mistreated - and several were subsequently tortured in prison, a human rights group has claimed. The damning report from Human Rights Watch paints a more complete picture of Washington's close cooperation with the regime of Libya's former dictator Muammar Gaddafi in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. The report also says waterboarding at CIA-run prisons was more widespread than has been acknowledged. Allies: The damning report claims the U.S. authorities handed Colonel Gaddafi his enemies 'on a silver platter' New details of brutal treatment by Bush-era interrogators included how terror suspects were not allowed to bathe for periods of up to three months. The 154-page Human Rights Watch report features interviews by the New York-based group with 14 Libyan dissident exiles. They describe systematic abuses while they were held in U.S.-led detention centers in Afghanistan – some for as long as two years – or in U.S.-led interrogations in Pakistan, Morocco, Thailand, Sudan and elsewhere before the Americans handed them over to Libya. ‘Not only did the U.S. deliver (Gaddafi) his enemies on a silver platter, but it seems the CIA tortured many of them first, said Laura Pitter, counterterrorism adviser at Human Rights Watch and author of the report. ‘The scope of the Bush administration abuse appears far broader than previously acknowledged,’ she said. The report comes days after the Justice Department announced it would not bring criminal charges against any CIA personnel over severe interrogation methods used in the detention and rendition program. Investigators said they could not prove any interrogators went beyond guidelines authorized by the Bush administration. Rights activists and some Obama administration officials say even the authorized techniques constituted torture, though the CIA and Bush administration argue they do not. Any new instances of waterboarding, however, would go beyond the three that the CIA has said were authorized. Former President George W. Bush has claimed waterboarding was only used on three senior al Qaeda figures . Former President George W. Bush, his Vice President Dick Cheney and the CIA have said that the method was used on only three senior al-Qaeda suspects at secret CIA black sites in Thailand and Poland – Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, Aby Zubayda and Abd al-Rahman al-Nashiri, all currently being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The technique involves pouring water on a hooded detainee's nose and mouth until he feels he is drowning. The 14 Libyans interviewed by Human Rights Watch were swept up in the American hunt for Islamic militants and al-Qaeda figures around the world after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. They were mostly members of the anti-Gaddafi Libyan Islamic Fighting Group who fled in the 1980s and 1990s to Pakistan, Afghanistan and African countries. The group ran training camps in Afghanistan at the same time al-Qaeda was based there but it largely shunned Osama bin Laden and his campaign against the United States, focusing instead on fighting Gadhafi. Ironically, the U.S. turned around and helped the Libyan opposition overthrow Gaddafi in 2011. Now several of the 14 former detainees hold positions in the new Libyan government. The accounts of new uses of simulated drowning came from two former detainees, Mohammed al-Shoroeiya and Khaled al-Sharif, who also described a gamut of abuses they went through. The two were seized in Pakistan in April 2003 and taken to U.S.-run prisons in Afghanistan, where al-Shoroeiya was held for 16 months and al-Sharif for two years before they were handed over to Libya. In Afghanistan, they were shackled in cells for months in variety of positions, often naked in almost total darkness with music blaring continuously, left to defecate and urinate on themselves. For example, al-Sharif spent three weeks seated on the ground in his cell with his ankles and wrists chained to a ring in the wall, forcing him to keep his arms and legs elevated. He said he was taken out of his shackles once a day for a half-hour to eat. Guantanamo Bay: A US Army MP holds down the head of a detainee so he is not identified . For the first three months, they were not allowed to bathe. ‘We looked like monsters,’ al-Shoroeiya said. Al-Shoroeiya described being locked naked for a day and a half in a tall, narrow, half-meter-wide (1 1/2-foot-wide) chamber with his hands chained above his head, with no food as Western music blasted loudly from speakers next to his ears the entire time. At another point, he was stuffed into a 1 meter by 1 meter (3 foot by 3 foot) box resembling a footlocker and kept there for more than an hour as interrogators prodded him with long, thin objects through holes in the side of the box. Both he and Sharif said they were repeatedly taken to a room where they were slammed against a wooden wall and punched in the abdomen. Al-Shoroeiya said one female American interrogator told him, ‘Now you are under the custody of the United States of America. In this place there will be no human rights. Since September 11, we have forgotten about something called human rights,’ according to the report. Al-Shoroeiya described being waterboarded, though he did not use the term. He said he was put in a hood and strapped upside down on a wooden board. Freezing water was poured over his nose and mouth until he felt he was suffocating. During several half-hour interrogation sessions, they would waterboard him multiple times, asking him questions in between while a doctor monitored his body temperature. ‘They wouldn't stop until they got some sort of answer from me,’ he told HRW. Al-Sharif described a similar technique. Instead of being strapped to a board, he was put on a plastic sheet with guards holding up the edges, while freezing water was poured over him, including onto his hooded face directly over his mouth and nose. ‘I felt as if I were suffocating,’ he told HRW. ‘I spent three months getting interrogated heavily ... and they gave me a different kind of torture every day. Sometimes they used water, sometimes not.’ President Barack Obama has called a halt to waterboarding in American facilities . Asked about the new accounts, CIA spokeswoman Jennifer Youngblood said the agency ‘has been on the record that there are three substantiated cases’ of the use of waterboarding. She said she could not comment on the specific allegations but noted the Justice Department's decision not to prosecute after it ‘exhaustively reviewed the treatment of more than 100 detainees in the post-9/11 period – including allegations involving unauthorized interrogation techniques.’ The Obama administration has ordered a halt to waterboarding and many of the severe techniques authorized by its predecessors. Others of the 14 former detainees in the Human Rights Watch described similar conditions as al-Shoroeiya and al-Sharif, particularly three held in the same U.S.-led prisons in Afghanistan. One of them, Majid Mokhtar Sasy al-Maghrebi, said he nearly went insane in isolation after months being shackled naked in dark, freezing cells with music blaring, pounding his head against the wall and screaming, ‘I want to die, why don't you just kill me?’ Another, detained in Mauretania, said that during interrogations by a foreigner he believed was American, his wife was brought to the detention center; his captors showed him his wife through a peephole and threatened to rape her if he did not cooperate. Human Rights Watch said the U.S. failed in its post-9/11 campaign to distinguish between Islamists targeting the United States and those who ‘may simply have been engaged in armed opposition against their own repressive regimes. ‘This failure risked aligning the United States with brutal dictators,’ the report said. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair had a public rapprochement with Colonel Gaddafi in 2004 . Eight of those interviewed were handed over to Libya in 2004 – the same year then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair made a public rapprochement with Gaddafi and Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell signed a major exploration deal off the Libyan coast, the HRW report noted. The remaining six were transferred to Libya over the two following years. All were jailed by Gaddafi's regime, most of them freed only after his fall. Most said they were not physically tortured – perhaps a result of Gaddafi's attempts to mend fences with the West – but were kept in solitary confinement for long periods. Several, however, told HRW they were beaten and tortured, including being given electrical shocks. The report also calls into question Libyan claims that one figure handed over by the Americans, Ibn el-Sheikh al-Libi, committed suicide in a Libyan prison. Al-Libi was held in U.S. secret prisons for years after 2001 and gave information under torture by the Egyptians that the Bush administration used to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq but was later discredited. After his handover, Libyan authorities said he hanged himself in his cell. But HRW researchers said they were shown photos of his body that showed signs of torture. Messages to Libya from the CIA and British intelligence among the Tripoli Documents published by HRW indicated the United States and Britain were eager to help Libya obtain several senior LIFG figures, including its co-founders, Abdel-Hakim Belhaj and Sami al-Saadi. Belhaj and his then-pregnant wife were detained by Malaysia with the help of British intelligence and then handed over to the CIA in Thailand, where he told HRW he was stripped and beaten. They were then taken to Libya, where Belhaj was imprisoned. After Belhaj arrived in Libya, a message believed to be from the then-head of counterterrorism at British intelligence congratulates the Libyan intelligence chief. Britain's help ‘was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built,’ he wrote.","Human Rights Watch report challenges George W.

"Determined: Software engineer Fran Bunce, 28, has sold all of her possessions in order to raise the deposit to buy a house . A young mother has finally raised enough money to buy her first home - after selling everything she owns. Software engineer Fran Bunce was desperate to get on the property ladder but was unable to scrape together a deposit. So the 28-year-old decided to sell everything she owned to raise the  £5,000 she needed. Items sold by the mother-of-one included a motorbike, sofa, bed, mirrors, fridge-freezer, light fittings, dining room table, cushions and dishwasher. She even parted with her clothes, jewellery and vast collection of shoes - while her nine-year-old daughter Summer, nine, sold her toys and games. Miss Bunce used websites Gumtree and eBay, newspaper classified ads and car boot sales to flog all her worldly goods. Miss Bunce, of Bath, Somerset, said she was delighted to buy the house - but is now living in an 'empty shell' after selling everything. She said: 'It came to that time when I needed to buy my own house, I’ve always wanted to own a home, I want to provide a bit of stability. 'But I realised I couldn’t really afford it unless I sold my own stuff for a deposit. I’m one of those people that once I set my mind to it I will do whatever it takes to get there. 'If I have to sacrifice those things then I will. I sold everything I owned, from my motorbike, sofa, clothes and shoes. I even sold creams and oils I haven’t used. 'I have sold whatever there is you can sell, you wouldn’t believe it. I had friends messaging me asking if I was selling my whole life. 'I’m over the moon to have finally done it, but I’ve been left in a bit of an empty shell now. I’ve got a mattress on the floor and my daughter’s got her bed and that’s about it.' Miss Bunce decided to sell her possessions in January this year after she worked out she could halve her monthly outgoings if she bought a house. She currently pays £900-a-month in rent, with bills on top, and calculated that mortgage payments would be much less. She sold many of her items to complete strangers and managed to negotiate prices with fellow tenants for white goods like her fridge-freezer and dishwasher. Miss Bunce also parted with many of her prized possessions, including precious jewellery and ornaments, and sold most of her vast collection of shoes. She sold each of her 30 pairs for £10, and raised £300 towards her total. Miss Bunce even retrained as a beautician so she could work evenings and weekends. She . said: 'The way I see it is I pay £900 a month on rent with bills on top . and if I move into a house my mortgage would be half of that. 'At . the moment things are really tight because we are paying and saving, . when we move into our new house we will have so much more money. Money-making: Miss Bunce was desperate to get on the property ladder but was unable to scrape together a deposit. This toy cot is one of the items that she sold . Sale: The mum-of-one began selling off her possessions - including a motorbike, sofa, bed, mirrors, fridge-freezer, light fittings, dining room table, cushions and dishwasher.

'I . sold my clothes, stuff I don’t wear any more. For years I haven’t . changed size so I sold what I didn’t wear. I got quite a lot for them . and I’m still selling some. 'Same with my shoes. I was just hoarding stuff I didn’t really need. 'The . only downside is that I didn’t get half as much as what they were worth . but you just want to make sure you can get what you can.' Miss Bunce is now living in an 'empty shell' after selling everything, including this red jacket and the cabinet . Cashing in: This pair of towels were even sold by Miss Bunce . Letting go: Miss Bunce, 28, is pictured with all of the shoes which she sold . Miss Bunce recently queued up with her mother for 20 hours at a store in Bath, during a recent sale, to buy some new furniture. She managed to buy a bed, worth £750, for just £200, and a sofa, worth £1,000, for a mere £500. Miss Bunce . added: 'I have managed to still save money, I sold my sofa for £700 and . bought another one for £500, I’ve got £200 in my pocket still. 'I have sold everything, but I’ve worked it all out, I know what will fit where and what I needed to get rid of.' Miss Bunce hopes to be living in the new home within a month.

"Women keen to increase their bust size but who despair at the £5,000 cost of a surgery may have an alternative solution. One company is offering a non-invasive breast enlargement treatment for a tenth of the cost - and it boasts impressive results. The pain-free treatment - delivered via a machine called the Wonderlift - claims to leave clients with a bust size of up to two times larger. The machine is a suction pump device which claims to improve the elasticity of skin tissue and shape and firm the breast. Scroll down for video . A woman tests out the device on This Morning saying 'it's quite comfortable. It just feels like suction really' The machine promises to firm, lift and tone - and comes in at £50 per treatment . During treatment, the suction is followed by vibration . massage to stimulate the breast regrowth, low frequency current to . stimulate the blood and lymph . circulation and prevent hyperplasia of mammary glands (abnormal cell development), and finally . low-level light therapy intended to assist with skin elasticity, smoothness, rejuvenation, . and spot and freckle removal. Wonderlift's founder Sajida Rashid says: 'The way we work is consumer led. I ask my clients what they're looking for and we deliver it. ‘After 12 week course, plus six follow up treatments, results should last up to two years.’ Appearing on ITV's This Morning, a young woman named Nicole tried out the breast enlarger. She said: 'It's quite comfortable. It just feels like suction really. 'I wanted to try this treatment because I’ve been for surgery consultations but I’m cautious of going under knife. 'I’ve had three treatments so far and think my breasts look fuller and feel firmer,' she said. Though Ruth and Phillip said they 'haven’t spotted major difference'. Journalist Stephen Handisides, who for the last 11 years has been known for his work around cosmetic surgery, dentistry and beauty, said on This Morning: 'I think it’s a good treatment, but after the first treatment people should see some results, though it is important to follow up and have two to three treatments within the first week. Nicole: 'I've had three treatments so far and think my breasts look fuller and feel firmer' 'You do have to have the time to go and have these treatments.' Ms Rashid has just sold machines to salons and clinics in London, nationwide and even Duba where practitioners are being trained to use them. She has priced the treatment at £50, but a course of 12 is recommended, which she offers to clients for £500. The same machine, she says, can perform a bottom lift and enhancement via the same technologies it uses to firm and enlarge breasts. 'It can reduce cellulite and lift the glutes up.' Although her background is not in the . beauty industry, Rashid's passion for the industry led to her opening . Glow Beauty salon in Leeds in 2008 - a decision she says she has never . regreted. Muscle re-education is the process of lengthening or shortening muscles. The . procedure sends a current to lift and re-educate muscles. The current . stimulates Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), a nucleotide that can . accumulate in the muscles themselves. The beautician later expanded her reach and won an award for one of her innovative treatments. 'I partnered with HLCC USA as an Exclusive UK distributor in 2011 and won Most Innovative Treatment And Service 2012 for HLCC UK by MyfaceMybody, then my salon was awarded Best Beauty Salon in Leeds 2012-2013. 'I came across non-surgical breast enhancing last year in the USA when the PIP implants had much media coverage and decided that I would like to launch this within the UK and worldwide. 'The treatment has been around for . long time, it's similar to cupping - but with the added benefits of . following therapies for maximum results.' Vacuum suction is used to manipulate fat tissue, which is mainly what breasts are made up of. The intense suction will also assist with pectoral muscle contraction which is what provides the breast area with shape. When a muscle lengthens or shortens, the skin lifts and firms. Vacuum suction also helps to increase blood circulation thus eliminating toxins through the lymph. The machine also employs so-called micro current therapy which promises to stimulate regeneration of nerves and soft tissue. Benefits of the micro current according to Rashid include improved muscle tone, muscle re-education, lifting, improved blood circulation, aided lymphatic drainage and increased collagen and elastin production.

"If you fall into the national . average - a curvy size 16 - and want your fashion with a capital 'F', . it's likely that you will find it difficult to buy stylish items in your . size. But with sales of plus size clothing topping £4.2 billion in 2012, up 40 per cent since 2007, the plus size clothing industry has never been in bigger demand. And one hosiery brand hoping to cash in is Cette who aim to revolutionise tights for plus size ladies everywhere. For the larger lady: Cette Madison Plus Size Tights, which cater for up to size 34, use a first of its kind Lycra Xceptionelle- a Lycra technology so new that it's still awaiting its Patent . Cette maintain that the 47 per cent of women in the UK who measure in at size 14 and above are not being catered for. So they have created Cette Madison Plus Size Tights, which cater for up to size 34 and use a first of its kind Lycra . Xceptionelle - a Lycra technology so new that it's still awaiting its patent. 'Gone are the days . of pinching waistbands and unflattering designs,' say Cette. 'Using the unique Lycra . Xceptionelle yarn and smart design features, we've managed to . transform the humble plus size tights and elevated them into hosiery . heroes.' Revolutionary: The 20 denier tights use a brand new technology that aims to be comfortable and reduce chafing . The 20 denier tights have been tailor made to offer the correct compression to the right . part of the leg with a special reinforced inner thigh area made in a . high denier yarn. The new design aims to eliminate painful chafing that many women on the go suffer with.

'INVISTA designed Lycra Xceptionelle hosiery thinking about this consumer and developed its patent pending invention through a combination of an engineered garment construction and the use of Lycra fibre technology that accommodates for the differing body shapes of larger women. In demand: MyTights.com who sell the new hosiery saw a 41 per cent increase in like-for-like for Plus Size products and say the new Cette tights pre-orders are sky high .

"The New Jersey heart doctor who blew nearly $150,000 at a pricey Manhattan strip club - and then refused to pay his bill after claiming he was drugged by club employees - spent a good chunk of the money on tipping the dancers, including five strippers he reportedly took into a private room at one time. 'He had five girls at a time. This guy is insatiable. I can’t even count to five,' a source from the swanky jiggle-joint told the New York Daily News. Dr. Zyad . Kivarkis Younan, a cardiologist at Robert Wood Johnson University . Hospital in New Jersey, has claimed that he did not authorize $135,303 . worth of charges to his American Express card at Scores New York . because, he claims, he was 'drugged' by an employee of the club and was . incapable of approving the charges. 'Drugged': Dr. Zyad Younan, pictured, said he was drugged by employees at Scores New York and did not authorize over $135,000 charged to his credit card . The famed strip club has since filed a lawsuit against the doctor in Manhattan Supreme Court. According . to the lawsuit, Scores claims Younan 'contested the charges alleging . that he was drugged by plaintiff’s employees and thus did not authorize . the charges and/or he was not at plaintiff’s place of business on the . aforesaid dates.' The club, however, says it has Younan on video at the club four times over a 10-day period in November. 'He seemed to be very happy. He was a big tipper. He must have been happy. He came back three times,' the source continued. 'We aim to please but we need to be paid for it.' The . source went on to say that the club made sure that Younan had the money . to pay his bill before issuing him tens of thousands of dollars on . 'Diamond Dollars,' in-house money that can be used to tip the dancers. Despite Younan's claims that he wasn't at the club on the nights the charges were made to his credit card, the club says it has him on video at the club on each of the nights his card was charged, and that 'he spent most of his money on girls.' The lawsuit alleges Younan 'voluntarily came to plaintiff’s place of business and requested that plaintiff provide him with food, beverages and services.' Plaintiff: Scores New York has filed a lawsuit against Younan for the money, and says he came 'voluntarily' to the club . Club . manager Stephen Hyman told the paper that it's not unusual for a person . to run up a big bill at Scores. He says, however, that it is unusual . when someone doesn't pay. 'We get a lot of very wealthy people here. You can run up a bill,' he said. Just . to get in the door at Scores will cost you $20. Bottles of champagne . can sometimes cost more than $1,000. A meal at the club, the paper . reports, will easily run you $250, and guests are allowed to leave tips . for the dancers on their credit cards. 'We charge reasonable — for us — prices for liquor. We don’t cater to beer drinkers,' Hyman said. As for Younan's claim that he was incapacitated when he was at the club, Hyman says, 'he was coherent until he saw the bill - or his wife saw the bill.' Younan is not married. Scores representative Steven Sabbeth told the NY Post 'This happens every once in a while, people get out of control with their credit cards, and then they wake up the next morning and realize what they’ve done.' 'They knew it the night before, but I guess it didn’t bother them because they were enjoying themselves.'","Dr. Zyad Younan, a New Jersey cardiologist, says he was drugged by employees at Scores New York .

"GM giant Monsanto is effectively pulling out of Europe after years of delays in trying to secure  approval for ‘Frankenstein food’ crops. The US-based company is dropping all of its requests to launch insect and pesticide-resistant forms of corn, sugar beet and soya beans. Campaigners said Monsanto had simply realised that the vast majority of people in Europe would not eat the foods. Opposition: Protesters stage a sit-in . against GM foods last year. Monsanto is dropping all of its requests to . launch insect and pesticide-resistant forms of corn, sugar beet and soya . beans because of public suspicion . The decision will be a blow to Britain’s fledgling GM industry which has been championed by ministers in recent weeks. So far, biotech firms have been deterred from growing GM crops in Europe by the tightest controls in the world. But the Environment Secretary, Science Minister and chief scientist have all publicly given the crops their blessing. Only last month, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said Brussels was putting British jobs at risk by dragging its feet over GM crops. He also made the extraordinary claim that millions of children in the developing world are ‘dying or going blind’ because the controversial technique has not been more widely adopted. However, the public remains deeply suspicious of GM foods. A survey by the Food Standards Agency last year found two in three believe food from animals given a GM diet should be labelled as such. And a British Science Association study showed public support for so-called ‘Frankenstein foods’ declining from 46 per cent in 2002 to only 27 per cent now. Biohazard: The public remains deeply suspicious . of GM foods, with only just over a quarter indicating they support them . despite efforts by Government claims that not using them will put . British jobs at risk . Campaign groups have raised concerns over ministers’ secret meetings with GM lobby groups – details of which emerged following freedom of information requests. EU member states have long been split on GM, leading to delays in the licensing of new strains. Only a handful of applications have been approved and the seven being withdrawn by Monsanto have been lodged for a cumulative total of 50 years. Its European arm will now focus on conventional crops and weed killer. Other GM companies, such as Bayer CropScience, Syngenta and BASF have also scaled back or dropped efforts to get crops accepted in Europe. Earlier this year German firm BASF abandoned plans for blight-resistant potatoes. Peter Melchett, the Soil Association’s policy director, said: ‘The fact is that there is no commercial market for GM food in Europe, and therefore no commercial reason for farmers to grow GM crops.’ Campaign group GM Freeze welcomed Monsanto’s announcement but pointed out the firm’s GM crops will still be used in animal feed and biofuels. Most meat, milk and eggs sold in British supermarkets come from animals that at some point have been given GM feed imported from the Americas. The decision will not affect Monsanto’s existing European GM crop, an insect-resistant maize. MON 810 is Europe’s only genetically-modified plant cultivated commercially and is grown for animal feed in Spain. Globally, more than 12 per cent of the world’s arable crops are devoted to GM crops. David Cameron is concerned Europe risks being ‘left behind’ after Monsanto’s decision. His official spokesman said: ‘While the rest of the world is reaping the benefits of new technologies, Europe risks being left behind. We cannot afford to let that happen.’","Only a quarter of Britons support the introduction of GM crops .
But the Government has thrown its weight behind their use ."
"Action: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith . Feckless welfare claimants who spend their benefits on drugs and alcohol will be handed smart cards so they can only spend state handouts on food and essentials. Plans being drawn up by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith will see the 120,000 problem families targeted with Oyster-style cards which can only be used in certain shops. That will mean those who waste their welfare money would only get the cash if it is used for certain items in chosen shops. Items that could be bought include food, clothes and household essentials. Mr Duncan Smith has ordered civil servants to draw up a scheme modelled on welfare reforms in Australia, where welfare credit cards have already been used with success. The first welfare recipients to get the cards are expected to be drug addicts and alcoholics, or those who are problem gamblers, in order to ensure that taxpayers’ money is not used to fuel addiction and dependency. That could pave the way for payment cards to be used more widely. Mr Duncan Smith’s aides say he is also keen to use the restricted payouts to help turn around the problem families who are blamed for the epidemic of antisocial behaviour in Britain today. A report published by Louise Casey, the tsar for troubled families, found that the families who cause the most problems are distinguished by drug and alcohol problems. The plans would require a change in the law since it is currently illegal for ministers to decree what benefits cash is spent on. But Mr Duncan Smith believes the proposals would achieve the double benefit of getting better value for taxpayers’ money and help turn round the lives of people who use welfare handouts to fuel their addictive lifestyles. He revealed his intentions at a fringe meeting at the Tory conference this week. Getting tough: Benefit claimants who spend their handouts on alcohol and drugs face a crackdown. (Posed by models) ‘I am looking at the moment at ways . in which we could ensure that money we give [benefit claimants] to . support their lives is not used to support a certain lifestyle,’ he . said. Asked about Australian use of smart . cards, he added: ‘I am certainly looking at it - I am going through that . in some detail. With the use of cards, we are looking at that to see if . we can do something. There . would be some legislative issues that we would have to go through about . allowing us to say “you cannot spend your money exactly where you like . it”.’ Prevention: The cards should stop claimants spending their benefits on alcohol . The plans will be controversial since . defenders of maintaining handouts will accuse the government of . attempting social engineering. But . civil servants are now studying papers on the experience in Australia, . where the scheme has just been rolled out nationwide after being . pioneered in Queensland and the Northern Territories. The Basics cards, as they are called, can only be used to purchase 'priority' items such as food, housing, clothing, education and health care. The government puts the money electronically on the card once a fortnight, when people receive their benefit payments. Between 50 per cent and 70 per cent of income is 'quarantined' for essential needs depending on the individual’s circumstances. The rest is available as cash. Mr Duncan Smith believes the scheme is better than food stamps, which are issued in some American states since those can be swapped for drugs. A senior official at the Department of Work and Pensions said: ‘Food tokens don’t work because they can be traded on the black market. Credit cards would not be for everyone claiming benefits but they could be used for extreme cases where people are not good at managing their lives like drug users or those with children living in poverty where money needs to be spent on food and clothes not drugs and alcohol. ‘Iain has asked the civil servants to look into this quickly.’","Feckless welfare claimants will be given Oyster-style cards which only work in certain shops to buy household and food essentials .

"Eight men were brutally caned in front of about 1,000 people inside a mosque compound in Indonesia after breaking strict Sharia laws on gambling.

Using a thin bamboo-like rattan cane, he then whipped them over their backs five times each. Scroll down for video . The eight men were caned in front of about 1,000 people after breaking strict Sharia laws on gambling . The men were each whipped five times on the back with a rattan cane - similar to bamboo - in a mosque compound in Aceh province, Indonesia . The punishment was dealt by a masked man wearing brown robes, who stepped forward after a state prosecutor read out the men's crimes . The mosque was filled with people as the punishment followed Friday morning prayers. Men can be seen filming and taking photos of the incident on smartphones as the victims tense up and grimace from the pain. The public caning followed nine arrests for gambling in July. The police seized a total of about £80 cash from the men. One of the men could not be caned because of his health but will face his punishment once he has recovered, state prosecutor Nurhalma, who uses a single name, said. He said each of the convicts should be whipped eight times but their punishments were reduced. Illiza Saaduddin Djamal, the mayor of Banda Aceh, said it was the seventh public caning of people who broke Sharia law since it was enforced in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh, 12 years ago. Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, has a policy of secularism but allows Aceh to follow a version of the Islamic law which forbids gambling.

"The number of people diagnosed with dementia has soared by 62 per cent in the last seven years, new figures show. An ageing population, improved diagnosis and better awareness could all be reasons why, experts said today. Today's statistics show that in 2013/14 there were 344,000 people in England who had received a diagnosis of dementia. An ageing population and better awareness could all be reasons for the increase (file picture) This is up from 213,000 in 2006/7, according to the figures, from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). Symptoms of the condition include memory loss,  changes in mood or behaviour, changes in personality and misplacing things. 'We are all aware of the challenges facing our ageing population and these figures will be vital for those planning and monitoring the effectiveness of dementia treatments and services,' said HSCIC chairman Kingsley Manning. George . McNamara, head of policy and public affairs at the Alzheimer’s Society . charity, said: “More people with dementia may now be known by their GP . and registered as having the condition, but the stark reality is that . hundreds of thousands still face the life-altering diagnosis of dementia . alone, without any support or information.' He added that over half of people living with dementia . still do not have a diagnosis and with an ageing population, diagnosing the condition must remain a priority. 'While it is one of the most feared conditions for those over 55, everyone has . a right to know they are living with dementia and deserves the chance . to access available treatments and support,' he added. Experts warned that more than half of people in England living with dementia still do not have a diagnosis. Image shows scans of a brain affected by Alzheimer's disease - the most common form of dementia . Hilary . Evans, director of external affairs at the charity Alzheimer's Research . UK, said the new statistics provided some idea of the scale of the challenge in England. 'While this report does not set out to investigate the reasons . for the rising figures, it's likely that recent moves to improve . dementia diagnosis rates, along with an ageing population, will have . contributed to this increase,' she said. Earlier this month a global report said the rate of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias is falling in the United States and some other rich countries. However, the epidemic is still growing simply because more people are living to an old age. An American over age 60 today has a 44 percent lower chance of developing dementia than a similar-aged person did roughly 30 years ago, the longest study of these trends in the U.S. concluded.","In 2013/14 there were 344,000 people in England who had been diagnosed .

"A mysterious discovery has been made inside the wall of a seaside house - the lid of an Egyptian coffin thought to date back 3,000 years. Auctioneer Stephen Drake was assessing the contents of a property after the death of its owner when he found the cobweb-covered relic. It was standing upright in the cavity of an outside wall, complete with painted face and faded hieroglyphics. Who are you? The lid (pictured) was discovered standing upright inside the cavity of an outside wall, complete with painted face and faded hieroglyphics. How it came to be inside the house remains a mystery . Mr Drake consulted historians at Cambridge University who said the six-foot-long sarcophagus cover appeared to date from 700BC. But how it came to reside inside the modest address which was being renovated in Bradwell-on-Sea, Essex remains a mystery. Mr Drake, 55, said: 'It really was quite bizarre. I'd been asked to look at the house by relatives of the previous owner, who'd died. Out of place: There is no sign of the mummy or the rest of the coffin and no information about how it came to reside in Bradwell-on-Sea (mapped) Mr Drake (pictured) said: 'When I stuck my head through I was surprised to see the coffin lid leaning up against a wall in the corner, covered in dust and cobwebs... It was just like a scene from an Indiana Jones movie' 'When I got there the renovation work was fully under way, and a large hole had been smashed in one of the outside walls. The lid is due to go to auction on September 13 with a current estimate of £1,000 to £2,000 . 'When I stuck my head through and looked inside, I was surprised to see the coffin lid leaning up against a wall in the corner, covered in dust and cobwebs. 'There was a painted face on it and some hieroglyphics. 'It was just like a scene from an Indiana Jones movie.' Mr Drake said the new owners of the house had no idea what the coffin lid was, but imagined it had been part of a collection of ancient items. He added: 'I believe the previous owner may have collected old artefacts. There were other very old items in the house.' If the coffin lid is indeed from 700 BC, that places it within the 25th dynasty in Egypt, when Pharoah Shebitku was on the throne. Shebitku, also known as Shabatka, was the third king of the 25th dynasty and ruled from 707 BC to 690 BC. He was the nephew and successor of Shabaka. and a son of Piye, the founder of this dynasty. Shebitku's throne name was Djedkare, meaning 'Enduring is the Soul'. There is no sign of the mummy or the rest of the coffin and no information about how it came to reside in England. The lid is due to go under the hammer on September 13 with a current estimate of £1,000 to £2,000. The history of mummification has recently been called into question after a study revealed that Egyptians were mummifying their dead 1,500 years earlier than previously thought. Traces of complex embalming agents were found in linen used to wrap bodies that were placed in tombs in one of the earliest recorded ancient Egyptian cemeteries. The formula used to treat the cloth predates the earliest scientific evidence of embalming in the area of northern Egypt by more than a millennium. Experts identified a pine resin, an aromatic plant extract, a plant gum, a natural petroleum source and a plant oil or animal fat in the funerary wrappings in unopened tombs at Mostagedda, in the region of Upper Egypt. The embalming agents that were found make up a similar recipe to those used at the zenith of Pharaonic mummification around 3,000 years later. The textile sample is held in the British museum and was collected in the 1930s, according to the study published in Plos One. Academics say that the 11-year study, which also involved Macquarie University in Australia, rewrites our understanding of the ancient civilisation. Traditional theories on ancient Egyptian mummification suggest that in prehistory - the Late Neolithic and Predynastic periods between around 4,500 and 3,100 BC - bodies dried naturally through the action of the hot, dry desert sand. If the coffin lid is indeed from 700 BC, that places it within the Egyptian 25th dynasty, when Pharoah Shebitku (sculpture pictured) was on the throne. Shebitku, also known as Shabatka, was the third king of the 25th dynasty and ruled from 707 BC to 690 BC. Modern lifestyles are often blamed for causing blocked arteries but our long-dead ancestors suffered from the same unhealthy symptoms, claim scientists. The remarkably preserved mummies from five ancient cultures – including Egyptians living 3,000 years ago – bear the unmistakeable hallmarks of heart disease. CT scans of hundreds of bodies found atherosclerosis, the narrowing of the arteries due to build-up of fatty deposits, which is the underlying disease process that causes heart attack and strokes. forebears suffered repeated infections, parasites and the ill-effects of breathing in smoke from cooking fires. But the triggers must have been very different from those afflicting us in modern times, it is claimed. Instead of a high fat diet, cigarette smoking and obesity being to blame, it is more likely our forebears suffered repeated infections, parasites and the ill-effects of breathing in smoke from cooking fires.","Auctioneer Stephen Drake was checking out the contents of the property after the death of the owner when he found the cobweb-covered relic .

"These heartbreaking images show the carcasses of 11 elephants discarded in a Kenyan wildlife reserve after poachers killed them for their ivory tusks. The distressing photos highlight how poaching is still rife across the Tsavo Conservation Area which is one of Kenya's oldest strongholds for elephants. The aerial images were taken in January by members of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT) who patrol the area daily to try and protect the habitat and the animals living there. Distressing: This heartbreaking image shows four of the 11 elephants hunted down and killed by poachers in the Tsavo Conservation Area in Kenya in January 2013 . Hunted: A carcass of an elephant killed by poachers in a Kenyan wildlife reserve. Poaching is still rife across the region . Reserve: Elephant herds are pictured making their way through dense vegetation in Nairobi National Park . Tsavo National Park is home to Kenya's largest population of elephants which now number some 12,000. The population was decimated by poachers during the 1970's and 1980's but their numbers have been steadily increasingly following the introduction of the DSWT's elephant Reintegration Centre. The pioneering project offers orphaned elephants a second chance at life in the wild once they have graduated from the DSWT's infant elephant orphanage in Nairobi National Park. In Tsavo, orphaned elephants aged three and older mix with wild herds, learning how to become wild elephants and independent of the Keepers that accompany them. But the DSWT says the region is now once again 'under increasing threat from the global appetite for ivory.' Second chance: Elephant orphans with their keepers from the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust who look after them until they are old enough to mix with the wild herds . Back on the rise: The Tsavo Conservation Area is home to Kenya's largest population of elephants with 12,000 now living in the region . Poachers are still targeting elephants in the reserve, using spears and poisoned arrows to kill their targets in a bid to avoid detection by the authorities. The DSWT runs daily patrols in the air and on the ground to keep the poachers out of the park. Rob Brandford, Director of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, said: 'Tsavo is a magical place, but one that needs our continued protection to prevent itselephants and wildlife being decimated by poachers and human greed. Our teams work tirelessly in the air and the ground to keep this stronghold safeforever for elephants.' DSWT's Aerial Surveillance Unit patrols the area, roughly the size of Wales, every day. They are on the look out for elephant poachers but also charcoal logging and illegal livestock grazing. On patrol: David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has daily aerial patrols over the region which look out for poachers . Grazing: David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust also patrols the area for illegal livestock grazing on Tsavo land (pictured) Mr Brandford continued: 'From tyre tracks indicating human activity to shooting blinds and platforms, well-armed Somali poachers to those poachers armed with silent poisoned arrows and spears, all pose a threat to the elephants that live here. 'Many poachers enter the Park to spend several days in the bush cooking fires along with cooking utensils, which if the pilots are lucky will reflect the sun's light toward the aircraft.' In addition to DSWT's eyes in the sky, the DSWT also has eight Anti-Poaching Teams patrolling the area on the ground, and last year the Teams arrested over 400 poachers. Mr Brandford continued: 'On the ground, it is akin to a war. Poachers are armed and many rangers have died, demonstrating just how much the wildlife is under threat and needs our help.'

"The world’s longest-running experiment has just had a 'breakthrough', after its ninth droplet of tar slowly gave in to gravity. The droplet was captured by the University of Queensland’s live webcam, although the blob hasn’t yet entirely separated from its parent chunk of tar. The experiment is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's longest-running laboratory experiment and was designed to show how seemingly solid objects can in fact be liquid. Rivetting: At room temperature pitch (pictured inside a glass funnel container) feels solid and can be shattered with a blow from a hammer, yet it is in fact fluid. The ninth drip can be tentatively hanging before it dropped in this image . The first Professor of Physics at the university, Professor Thomas Parnell, began the experiment in 1927 to explain that everyday materials can exhibit strange properties. The experiment is listed in the Guinness . Book of World Records as the world's longest-running laboratory . experiment and was designed to show how seemingly solid objects can in . fact be liquid. At room temperature pitch feels solid and can be shattered with a blow from a hammer. Yet  it  is in fact fluid. This can be seen by the incredibly slow drips that have formed in the pitch experiment. Scientists estimate that pitch is about 100 billion times more viscous than water. The experiment demonstrates the fluidity and high viscosity of pitch, a derivative of tar once used for waterproofing boats. At room temperature, pitch feels solid and can be shattered with a blow from a hammer, yet it is in fact fluid. Professor Parnell heated a sample of pitch and poured it into a glass funnel with a sealed stem. It was then left for the three years, so that the pitch could settle, and finally, in 1930, the sealed stem was cut. Since then, the pitch has slowly dripped out of the funnel - so slowly that now, 84 years later, the ninth drop is only just fully formed. The eighth drip that fell in 2000 and the ninth drop both took around 13 years to fall. Touchdown! Here the drip of pitch can be seen making contact with the eight drop at the bottom of a beaker. The eighth drip that fell in 2000 and the ninth drop both took around 13 years to fall . The experiment was set up as a demonstration and is not kept under special laboratory conditions  - it is currently stored in a display cabinet in the foyer of mathematics and physics department. Because of this, the rate of pitch flow changes with seasonal variations in temperature. Nonetheless, scientists have estimated that the viscosity of pitch is around 20 billion times more viscous than water. 1927                                  Hot pitch poured .

Sadly this latest glimpse of physics in action comes too late for a former caretaker, who watched over the experiment for more than 50 years and died last year. Professor John Mainstone, missed observing the drops fall on three occasions – by a day in 1977, by just five minutes in 1988, and in 2000 when a webcam that was recording it missed the crucial moment when the drop fell during a 20-minute power outage. The next step is to monitor how long it takes the ninth drop to separate from the pitch above it.

"Countless cyclists have been injured - or even killed - after falling victim to a driver's blind spot, but a new  light could help put an end to this. Laserlight projects an icon onto the road, helping to ensure that drivers are aware of an approaching cyclist, even if they cannot see them. The green image is beamed between 16 and 19ft (five and six metres) in front of a cyclist, signalling that a driver should not turn across their path. Scroll down for video . Early warning: Laserlight projects an image of a cyclist onto the road (pictured) , helping to ensure that drivers are aware of an approaching cyclist even if they cannot immediately see them . According to the maker's website, the 'classic blind spot scenario' is the number one danger to cyclists. London-based Blaze claim that just under 80 per cent of cycle accidents occur when a bicycle is travelling straight and a vehicle manoeuvres into them. According to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (Rospa), 19,438 British cyclists were involved in accidents last year - and of those 109 died. Rospa says that the most dangerous hours for cyclists are between 3pm and 6pm as well as 8am and 9am on weekdays. However, cycling accidents in the dark are more likely to be fatal. Around 75 per cent of fatal or serious cyclist accidents occur in urban areas and 75 per cent happen at, or near, a road junction . The rechargable Laserlight, they say, works to provide a bigger 'footprint' on the road for the cyclist. The Laserlight also works as a normal white LED front light - throwing out more than 300 lumens in its brightest mode.

Watch out: London-based Blaze claim that just under 80 per cent of cycle accidents occur when the bicycle is travelling straight ahead and a vehicle manoeuvres into them . Works as both a traditional 300 lumen bike light and a warning laser light . Cost: £125; $200; €125 . Outer casing: Aluminium . Power: Charges using USB cable . Weight: 6.4oz (182g) Waterproof up to 3ft (1m) deep . Run time: Up to 13 hours with and laser both flashing . The signature laser image is projected by a separate diode inside the light and can be switched on and off independently. Its makers explained that the icon is green because the human eye is most receptive to light on that wavelength. It also takes relatively little energy to generate green light, resulting in the Laserlight’s impressive run times - 13 hours with light and laser both flashing. The bicycle projection is visible in daylight, but is designed for use in low light when a cyclist would usually use their lights. In the UK, this makes up approximately 50 per cent of commuting hours. It is available to buy, costing £125 in the UK, $200 in the U.S. and €125 across the rest of Europe.

"Sir Alex Ferguson enjoyed a glittering reign as Manchester United manager, but not all of his signings were successful at Old Trafford. As £20m winger Nani returns home to Sporting Lisbon after falling out of favour at United, we look back at some of Ferguson's worst signings during his Old Trafford reign. Homecoming: Nani was mobbed when arriving in Lisbon as he returns to Sporting on a season-long loan . Massimo Taibi . He cost £4.5m in 1999 and played only the four times. Dubbed the Blind Venetian by the tabloid press, Taibi returned to Italy within six months. His blooper against Southampton, as the ball squirmed under his body, ensures his name will never be forgotten. Blooper: Massimo Taibi is remembered for his howler against Southampton . Mark Bosnich . Signed from Aston Villa to replace Peter Schmeichel but beset by injury problems and inconsistency. In his book last year, Ferguson described Bosnich as a 'terrible professional'. 'We played down at Wimbledon and Bosnich was tucking into everything: sandwiches, soups, steaks. He was going through the menu. We arrived back in Manchester, and Mark was on mobile phone to a Chinese restaurant to order a takeaway. Is there no end to you? I just couldn't make an impact on him.' Replaced as United's first-choice keeper by Fabien Barthez. Damning: Mark Bosnich was described as a 'terrible professional' by Sir Alex Ferguson . William Prunier . Looked like Jaap Stam but played nothing like him. Horror show against Spurs in a 4-1 defeat sealed his fate. In his autobiography, Ferfuson recounted a conversation with Patrice Evra. 'William Prunier was another one I was mocked for. Even Patrice Evra, in that high-pitched way, said to me one day: 'Boss, did you have William Prunier?' Ryan Giggs' face dropped as he waited for the response. 'Aye, we had him on trial once,' I snapped. 'On trial?' Evra squeaked back. 'A two-game trial?' 'Yes, and it was a disaster.' Ferguson admitted. Neil Whitworth . A centre-half signed in the early days by Ferguson in a £45,000 deal from Wigan. Played only once in four years for the club in a 1-1 draw at Southampton in March 1991. Eric Djemba-Djemba . So bad they named him twice, Djemba-Djemba was signed to add steel to the United midfield but departed after 18 months. He is, however, an FA Cup winner after being part of the United side that lifted the trophy in 2004. Good quiz question, that. What has Djemba-Djemba won that Edwin van der Sar, Wayne Rooney and Rio Ferdinand have not? Misfit: Eric Djemba-Djemba helped Manchester United win the FA Cup in 2004 but was soon out of the club . Juan Sebastian Veron . The £28.1m signing who was billed as a superstar. Could never quite get to grips with the physicality of the English game and despite some magical moments in the Champions League, he underwhelmed. United did, however, reclaim £15m when he was sold to Chelsea two seasons after his arrival. Costly: Juan Sebastian Veron never justified the large transfer fee Manchester United payed for him . Kleberson . A Brazilian World Cup winner in 2002, United spent £6m to bring Kleberson to Old Trafford from Atletico Paranaense one year later, seeing off competition from Leeds United. Ferguson said at the time: 'One of the reasons we sold Veron was because we knew we were getting Kleberson - that shows how highly we regard his talent.' He was the first Brazilian to sign for United. Now we'll get onto the second one... Big stage: Kleberson won the World Cup with Brazil in 2002 before moving to Old Trafford . Anderson . Signed from Porto in a deal worth in excess of £19m, Anderson had previously been tracked by Chelsea and Real Madrid. His first season was a success as United won the Champions League in 2008 but he failed to kick on, suffering injury problems and a visible lack of fitness. He was voted best player at the Under 17 World Championships in 2005 but is now surplus to requirements at Manchester United and will be sold if United can find a buyer. Surplus: Anderson failed to kick on at Manchester United after his big-money move from Porto . Liam Miller . Signed on a free transfer from Celtic in 2004. In Ireland, they referred to him as 'the future of Irish football' or the 'next Roy Keane.' Scored only twice - in League Cup ties against Barnet and Crewe - and ended up at Sunderland under Keane, where he fared better but was eventually transfer-listed. Keane said: 'If you are driving to work don't get in the car with Liam Miller because he has more car crashes than anyone I know. It's nothing to do with him as a player or as a lad. If he is late once or twice, even three or four times, maybe well and good, but when it is five, six or seven times then you have to draw the line.' High hopes: Liam Miller was described as 'the future of Irish football' and the 'next Roy Keane' Bebe . The most bizarre of Ferguson's signings, brought in to the club on the recommendation of Carlos Quieroz despite the manager never having watched him either live or on television. The £7m winger did not start a Premier League game in his four-year spell with the club, exiting this summer to Benfica. Blind faith: Ferguson never watched Bebe play but still spent £7m to bring him to Manchester United . Ralph Milne . At an LMA dinner in 2009, Ferguson admitted Milne, who scored only three goals in his first season at the club, was his worst signing: 'I only paid £170,000 but I still get condemned for it.' The forward exited United in 1991 and joined Sing Tao, the now defunct Hong Kong club. David Bellion . A £1.5m gamble from Sunderland in 2003. Had raw pace and a decent finisher but some way short of the required quality. Scored eight goals in two seasons before being moved on. Dry: David Bellion scored eight goals in two seasons at Old Trafford before being sold . Dong Fangzhou . The first Chinese player to play for United arrived in 2004 but could not play until 2006 due to work permit issues. Appeared once in the League Cup in a 2-0 defeat at home by Coventry and also came on a substitute in one game in the Champions League. His contract was terminated in 2008. He did not score any goals but he may well have sold some shirts. Now starring for Hebei Zhongji. Absence: Dong Fangzhou didn't feature for United for his first two years due to work permit problems . Wilfried Zaha . Fergie's final signing has endured a miserable time at Old Trafford and is still to start a Premier League game. David Moyes felt that Zaha's work on the training ground was short of the required standard and he was loaned to Cardiff in January, where he struggled once more. He was part of the group that toured the USA but was not in the United squad that faced Swansea last weekend and could leave the club in the next fortnight. Underwhelming: Wilfried Zaha arrived from Crystal Palace with a big reputation but hasn't broke through . Diego Forlan . The Uruguayan forward signed from Independiente in 2002 but took 27 matches to score his first goal. He went on to score 17 in 95 appearances and is most famously remembered for scoring twice in a victory at Liverpool. 'He came from Uruguay, and made the Scousers cry,' went the ditty. Since leaving, he proved himself as a brilliant goalscorer with Villarreal and Atletico Madrid. Wait: Diego Forlan took 27 matches to score his first goal for Manchester United .

The release of the images unsubtly coincides with the impending visit to South Korea by U.S. President Barack Obama, who lands in Seoul tomorrow. Ladies man: An undated picture released on Thursday shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-un surrounded by soldiers at a women's artillery unit in North Korea's southeastern province of Kangwon . The undated photographs show the young dictator surrounded by women in uniform, all battling to get a chance to touch their ‘dear leader’ while crocodile tears flood their eyes. He is also seen observing a firing drill at the women’s artillery unit in south-eastern Kangwon. The pictures were released by North Korean newspaper of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, Rodong Sinmun, on Thursday. Scenes of hysterical women surrounding Kim Jong-un are often seen in western media, as they form part of the ‘official image’ portrayed in handouts by the North Korean government. A majority of images sent out by Rodong Sinmun are of a jolly-looking Kim Jong-un visiting military units and factories or inspecting his vanity projects such as a ski-slope and a summer camp for ‘high-achieving children’.

Barack Obama is due in Seoul on Friday, where he is expected to discuss ways to deal with North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. And State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki admitted they were closing watching Pyongyang and the Korean pennisula. She said: 'We have certainly seen the press reports ... regarding possible increased activity in North Korea's nuclear test site. 'We continue to urge North Korea to refrain from actions that threaten regional peace and security and to comply with its international obligations and commitments.'

"Plea: After fleeing the Swazi king, Tintswalo Ngobeni seeks asylum in the UK . A young woman is seeking  asylum in Britain after she spurned the advances of the polyamorous King Mswati III of Swaziland and refused to join his harem of 13 wives. Tintswalo Ngobeni, 22, fled to England from the southern African nation as a teenager after she caught the attention of the millionaire monarch, a notoriously oppressive ruler known for his lavish lifestyle. As part of Swazi custom, King Mswati III, 45, is permitted to choose a new bride every year. Miss Ngobeni, who now lives in Birmingham, was just 15 when the King made his advances after seeing her at the palace of his fourth wife, LaNgangaza. She said she was ‘terrified’ when she learned of his marriage intentions. She added: ‘He started calling me at boarding school. He would ask me if I wanted to be a part of the royal family. I had to keep quiet about my fears but I knew I didn’t want to get married to him and have a life devoted to the king. 'His wives are kept in their palace, surrounded by bodyguards, and they can’t really go anywhere unless the king says so. The only thing they do is go to America once a year, as the king gives them a shopping allowance.' Miss Ngobeni was forced to abandon a comfortable lifestyle in a private boarding school as her aunt, who was her chief guardian, arranged the escape to England to join her mother, who moved to Birmingham five years earlier, fleeing an abusive husband. Scroll down for video . Culture: The Reed Dance ceremony, pictured, is known as Umhlanga and sees thousands of Swaziland's 'prettiest virgins' dance topless for King Mswati III, every August, hoping to be his next wife. Fears: Miss Ngobeni believes she could be arrested or even killed if she has to return to Swaziland . ‘I didn’t have a choice,’ she said. ‘Nobody has ever turned down the king or dares to disobey him, so I just disappeared.’ Since . her arrival in England, Miss Ngobeni has become a vocal opponent of the . oppressive Swazi regime, where political opposition parties are banned . and activists routinely arrested or assaulted. Amorous: As part of Swazi custom, King Mswati II, 45, is permitted to choose a new bride every year . However, Miss Ngobeni’s high-profile activities, including weekly protests outside the Swazi embassy in London with activist group Swazi Vigil, have caught the attention of the authorities in her home country and she now believes she is in more danger than ever. She said: ‘Recently I had news that people had been sent from Swaziland to come and get me, which really scares me. If I went back, I would be arrested or much worse as there are people there who are tortured, beaten up or killed for being politically active.’ Miss Ngobeni now lives in fear of having to return to Swaziland, after her first plea for political asylum in England in 2007 was denied in 2011. Last month, she was arrested and taken to an immigration detention centre after 18 months of reporting weekly to the authorities. However, after pressure from the TUC and the office of Roger Godsiff, Labour MP for Birmingham, Miss Ngobeni was released and has now been granted an appeal by the Home Office. Mr Godsiff said yesterday: ‘We were very pleased solicitors were successful in achieving a judicial review into Miss Ngobeni’s case.’ The father of 27 children, King Mswati III was a guest at the William and Kate wedding as well as the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations last summer. The king’s sixth wife escaped from the royal harem last year, citing years of ‘emotional and physical abuse’ by her husband. A spokesman from the Home Office refused to comment.","Tintswalo Ngobeni, 22, fled to England from Africa as a teenager .

"A mysterious object launched by Russian military is being followed by Western space agencies over fears it could be part of a Kremlin project to kill satellites. Object 2014-28E, which was tracked over Guatemala on Monday night by N2YO, has been making unusual movements according to amateur observers. The Financial Times reported that it has been moving towards other Russian space objects and is now being monitored by Norad - the U.S. Military's space defense command. Scroll down for video . Mysterious objects: Object 2014-28E, which was tracked over Guatemala on Monday night by observers N2YO, has been making unusual movements according to amateur astronomers . The object had originally been classed as space debris, propelled into orbit as part of a Russian rocket launch in May to add three Rodnik communications satellites to an existing military constellation. There are theories that it could be a civilian project used to pick up 'space junk' or could be a method of fixing broken orbiters. However Russia did not declare the launch, prompting concerns it could be part of another objective. Some believe that with the deterioration of West-Moscow relations and the revived interest in space weaponry, this could make strategic sense. The anti-satellite program launched under Stalin - known as Istrebitel Sputnikov - was closed down in 1989. Patricia Lewis, research director at think-tank Chatham House, told the FT: 'It could have a number of functions, some civilian and some military. One possibility is for some kind of grabber bar. 'Another would be kinetic pellets which shoot out at another satellite. Or possibly there could be a satellite-to-satellite cyber attack or jamming.' However she added that: 'It would be odd if space were to remain the one area that [militaries] don’t get their hands on.' Space race: Russia became the first nation to launch a satellite into oribit, with Sputnik 1 in 1957 . Russia became the first nation to put a satellite into orbit with the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957. But the United States first put a man on the moon in 1969 and Russia has not yet done so. In 2007, two of Sputnik's heirs, Voyagers 1 and 2, are headed towards the edge of the Solar System after 30 years in space. Six years later, they announced that they would be sending an unmanned probe to the Moon by 2015. The craft, called Luna-Glob, or Moon-Globe, will be carried by the first rocket to blast off from a new facility that Russia is building in its far eastern Amur region. The claims come the same week that Philae attempted to land on the surface of a comet. Rosetta's craft captivated the world when it touched down, but went into hibernation mode late on Friday when its primary battery ran out of power. Earlier this month, the International Space Station had to fly higher as to avoid Chinese space junk floating in orbit. Russia has a number of satellites in the solar system, and has over ambitious space projects in the pipeline - including sending an unmanned probe to the Moon by 2015 .","The mysterious object was tracked over Guatemala on Monday night .

"German archaeologists and filmmakers have begun a massive expedition to explore the hauntingly beautiful sunken caves of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, once considered by the Mayans as the gateways to their underworld. The description seems only appropriate given the hundreds of human remains that line the floors of these underwater labyrinths. In the Stone Age, these caves, which were dry at the time, were used as burial sites. Later, the Mayans worshiped them and believed that they would lead them to the ‘Place of Fear.’ Today, these caves are the subject of a new 3-D film titled ‘The Cages of the Dead,’ which is set to hit theaters in the summer of 2013. But already, photos from the one-of-kind voyage give us a preview of the unsettling wonders held in these subterranean caverns. Spectacular: German archaeologists and filmmakers are exploring the hauntingly beautiful underwater caves along Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula with the hope of finding historical artifacts. One of Kind: Already, the crew has found some a treasure trove of items, including 10,000-year-old human remains. Never Before Seen: These remains date back to the Stone Age when these caves were used as burial grounds and have never been filmed before. The Mayans lived in this region of Mexico from around 3,000 B.C. to 900 A.D, and they believed that these caverns led to their mystical underworld known as Xibalba, or the 'Place of Fear.' Written about in their ancient scrolls, Xibalba was a complicated place. It was to be both feared, filled with monstrous beings, but also revered, as it was home to the beloved dead. To honor those who had fallen, the Mayans constructed temples throughout tunnels like these. In the end, it was believed that those who could make it through the dreaded Xibalba would rise 'triumphantly like the sun.' But getting these shots is no simple task for director Norbert Vander and his team. They require transporting incredibly expensive 3-D cameras, along with hundreds of pounds of equipment, through the sweltering jungles before then lowering them deep into the jagged rocks of the caves below. The crew must then dive as deep as 300 feet to access the hundreds of miles of meandering tunnels with little less than a lantern to cut through the absolute darkness. ‘If, under these circumstances, you calculate your air supply incorrectly, get lost or panic, you're as good as dead,’ Uli Kunuz, a team member, told ABC News. But all of this is worth in the end, as their ultimate goal is to document for the first time ever some of the historical treasures kept deep underground. Already, they have discovered some of the oldest human remains to be found in the Americas - the 10,000-year-old bones of a boy. They also found a fire pit from roughly 8,500 years ago kept in astoundingly good condition. The water helps to preserve much of these items that otherwise would have disintegrated years ago. Team leader Florian Huber said, ‘It looked as if there had been a fire there just the day before yesterday.’ The crew has also discovered ancient ceramics . and jewelry left by the Mayans, as well as the remains from long-extinct . animals, including the giant ground sloth and the mastodon. In the end, they hope . to discover more artifacts that can perhaps shed light on the origins of species on the continent.‘Perhaps . the cenotes contain the answer to the questions of when the first . humans reached the Americas and how the continent was settled,’ Huber . said. To make this incredibly journey possible, the crew have relied on a combination of will and the best modern technology has to offer. Because the crews are diving so deep underwater, compressed . air alone would not work. Instead, divers must rely on Trimix, a combination of . oxygen, nitrogen and helium to survive. Rocky Straights: Crew members dive as deep as 300 feet to access the hundreds of miles of meandering tunnels with little less than a lantern to cut through the absolute darkness. As far as capturing their astonishing . discoveries, the crew uses high-tech camera cases that are light and small enough to capture these incredible moments on film. In the past, to transport 3-D cameras underwater, filmmakers used to have to keep their machinery in underwater cases that were almost as tall as a man and weighed hundreds of pounds. Carrying it was difficult enough, let alone having to move it through narrow passageways of underwater caves. The film's producers say the costs are more than enough to be able to . Ultimately, Huber believes that the documentary will allow viewers to catch a glimpse of this magic place and that the 3-D will let them feel as if they were actually there. And while he understands that exposing these treasures may mean jeopardizing their safety, he hopes that it it will in turn lead to their preservation. 'Of course, this sort of film can increase the temptation,' Huber says. 'But it can also promote respect for this world and the . willingness to protect it.'","German filmmakers are exploring caves in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula to document the one-of-kind wonders held there .

"They're creatures of the sea that always look happy. But for these Beluga whales their lives are far from it. Every year in Nilmoguba, a small village on the north of Russia, near the Polar Circle, hundreds are rounded up to begin a sad journey into captivity from which only half survive. Sad journey: This Beluga whale named Petrovich will have new home in Moscow . A team of specialists are issued with licenses to catch the Beulgas there and then train them for a life entertaining humans. It takes around six months and - if they live - they will then be transferred to a circus or aquapark somewhere else in Russia where they are expected to perform. The whale pictured here, named Petrovich, was caught in the autumn and since then has become accustomed to people and feeding in captivity. Soon he will have new home in Moscow. Petrovich is 12 years old and surprised his trainers by adapting very easily. But, as each whale has its own character, not all do. A captured Beluga in Nilmoguba, a small village on the north of Russia, near the Polar Circle . This whale was caught at sea, it has since been trained by specialists not to be afraid of humans .

If they do not adapt, because of stressful experience or because of lack of food, they die very . quickly. The beluga whale is a small, toothed whale that is white as an adult. The Beluga's body is stout and has a small, blunt head with a small beak, tiny eyes, thick layers of blubber, and a rounded melon. They have one blowhole. Beluga means 'white one' in Russian. This whale was caught at sea, it has since been trained by specialists not to be afraid of humans . Beluga means 'white one' in Russian and the whales turn white when they are adults . It takes around six months for the whales to be trained and - if they survive - they will then be transferred to live in circus or aquapark where they are expected to perform . It is estimated that there are about 40,000 to 80,000 of them world-wide. The whales are often also known as 'sea canaries' because of their songs and chatter, which can even be heard above the water. Belugas mostly eat fish, squid, crustaceans and octopi and have 34 teeth designed not for chewing, but for grabbing and tearing prey. In the wild these beautiful animals have few natural enemies. Only rare meetings with a killer whale or a polar bear puts them in danger. But in captivity, it is different.

"As a society, we've become used to May to September relationships - just look at Madonna and her latest backing dancer; Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones and their 25-year age gap. No one bats an eyelid any more. But one 'exteme toy boy' does raise a few eyebrows when he steps out with his lover - because baby-faced Kyle Jones, 31, is in a relationship with a 91-year-old great-grandmother. Kyle, from Augusta, Georgia, dates numerous pensioners at the same time and even takes them home to meet his 50-year-old mother. For the last five years he has been in a 'casual' relationship with 91-year-old Marjorie McCool. Scroll down for video . Kyle Jones, 31, says he has never dated a woman his own age, shares a tender kiss with Marjorie McCool, 91 at a local park . Kyle, who says says that he always been attracted to older women, has even taken girlfriend Marjorie McCool, 91 (L) home to meet his mother Ceceila Jones (R) And despite the 60-year age gap, the pair have an active sex life and can't keep their hands off each other. Kyle said: 'Everyone's brain is wired differently, some guys prefer blondes, some brunettes, some like other guys - I like old ladies.' The call centre worker was just 18 when he first acted on his attraction for older women and began a sexual relationship with a 50-year-old. Now Kyle uses dating websites to find women as well as chatting them up in his daily life. He said: 'Most of the time, the average age I go for is between 60 and 80. 'Whenever I'm trying to speak to an older woman, the first reaction I get is 'you're way too young'. 'I find persistence is good so I tell them it'll be fun.' Although officially single, Kyle regularly sees up to five women at a time and takes them on dates - and even home to meet his mother. As well as Marjorie, 91, (left) Kyle is currently dating, Anna Reimol, 67, (right) and another three older women . Despite a 60 year age gap, the couple say they have an excellent and active sex life . In 2009 he met great-grandmother Marge - short for Marjorie - in the bookstore where she was working and asked for her number. Marge, who had been single for 37 years since splitting with the father of her six children, agreed to go on a date. She said: 'In the beginning I got jealous of his other women but he keeps coming back to me and tells me I'm the best. 'The physical side of our relationship is wonderful. I amaze myself, he amazes me. There's nothing better. Kyle mother Ceceila, (R) says she has realised that her sons preference for older women like Marjorie (L) is more than a phase . 'I wear sexy outfits to bed. I try to keep my bra on though because I don't have much left. 'My family consists mostly of boys, and they don't really care - what I do is my business. 'Their ages are 71, 63, 61, 52 and 50. 'When people see us out together they probably think that he's my son, or maybe even a grandson. I have grandsons older.' And while many of the women he dates can't believe such a young man would find them attractive, Kyle is adamant he does. He said: 'Often, the things women are so self-conscious about is what I'm into. I like the neck lines and wrinkles. 'Women worry about their boobs sagging but I think the natural hang looks great. I'm really not a fan of plastic surgery. 'I don't like to say gray, I'm a fan of platinum hair. I prefer it natural.' However, due to his girlfriends' advancing years, most of his relationships face a limited future. He said: 'Perhaps I would like to meet the right person and settle down, but I know they would die before me.' Kyle's preference for the elderly has drawn criticism from those who see him as opportunistic. He said: 'The most common criticism I hear is 'you're after money' or 'you're after inheritance'. 'Or people think these women must be buying me things. 'But it's not true at all - I do this because I like it and they like it too. I've dated women from various ends of the financial spectrum, but it's never about what they have.' Kyle's mother, Ceceila Jones Clark, 50, initially thought it was a phase her son was going through. She said: 'I think a lot of children have crushes on their teachers, so it didn't strike me as strange. 'I really wasn't sure if that was something that he was going to stay with or if it was just a cougar phase some young men go through. 'However, later when I saw the kind of women he was spending time with I knew it wasn't a phase.'","Kyle had first sexual experience with a 50-year-old aged 18 .

"A Texas breast cancer doctor has been convicted of aggravated assault after she poisoned her lover by lacing his coffee with a chemical found in antifreeze. A Houston jury found Dr Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo guilty of spiking her physician boyfriend Dr George Blumenschein's drink with ethylene glycol. Prosecutors told the court that she was a devious and diabolical person who became obsessed with her colleague following an affair that turned into a 'fatal attraction'. The 43-year-old researcher who worked at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center could face life in prison with the punishment stage of the trial beginning as soon as the verdict was read out. A Houston jury convicted Dr Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo (left) of aggravated assault after she poisoned her lover Dr George Blumenschein (right) with ethylene glycol . The 43-year-old researcher who worked at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer wiped away a tear in court on Wednesday after her defense attorney Derek Hollingsworth made his closing argument . Jurors heard that the relationship between the pair had deteriorated after Blumenschein spurned her in favor of his 10-year live in girlfriend Evette Toney. They  were involved in a casual sexual relationship, but maintained to some that it was strictly professional. Witnesses testified that Gonzalez-Angulo had access to ethylene glycol at the hospital where she and Blumenschein worked. Dr Blumenschein admitted himself to the hospital on January 27, 2013 complaining that he did not feel right, and doctors soon discovered he was suffering kidney failure. Earlier that day he drank two cups of coffee prepared for him by Dr Gonzalez-Angulo, which authorities now believe may have been laced with ethylene glycol, a chemical commonly found in automotive antifreeze. He is now six to eight times more likely to die a premature death. Dr Gonzalez-Angulo was picked up and charged with aggravated assault five months later. She was apparently upset that Dr. Blumenshein and Dr Toney were back together and trying to have a baby. Witnesses testified that Gonzalez-Angulo had access to ethylene glycol at the hospital where she and Blumenschein worked . Prosecutors told jurors that an affair between Gonzalez-Angulo and Blumenschein turned into a 'fatal attraction' after he spurned her in favor of his 10-year live in girlfriend Evette Toney (pictured) She gave an emotional testimony after she revealed to the court that she still loved her long-term partner, despite discovering that he was having an affair. She said he had always denied it . Blumenschein survived the poisoning but told jurors he now only has 40 percent of his kidney function. Gonzalez-Angulo's attorneys argued that other people, including Toney, might have been responsible for the poisoning, an allegation that Toney has denied. However, during testimonies earlier this week, Toney told jurors that she did not poison Blumenschein and that despite the affair she still loves him. She said they are still together and are working on their relationship. 'It's a work in progress,' she said. Toney testified that shortly after Blumenschein was hospitalized following his poisoning, he told her that he believed Gonzalez-Angulo had poisoned him. Blumenschein survived the poisoning but told jurors he now only has 40 percent of his kidney function . But Toney said he told her to not tell anybody of his suspicions because he feared Gonzalez-Angulo might hurt him again or hurt her. 'At one point, George said, 'Evette, do not poke the dragon,' Toney said. Toney testified she helped Blumenschein record telephone conversations he had with Gonzalez-Angulo as part of efforts to try and gather evidence against her. Gonzalez-Angulo did not make a confession on the phone calls, but prosecutors have said they show the obsessive feelings she had toward Blumenschein. While Gonzalez-Angulo's attorneys questioned Toney, they suggested that Toney had been upset Blumenschein would not marry her.

We are never far from a foodie treat: tender tagines; spongy coconut macaroons and streetside mechoui lamb, cooked in an underground pit and served with a sprinkling of salty cumin. But we prepare the best meal in the kitchens of our plush riad, the Dar les Cigognes. Under the watchful eyes of Keri and Fouiza - one of the riad’s rotund dadas (cooks traditionally employed by wealthy Moroccan families) - we go to work ‘fluffing’ piping hot couscous. Later, Fouiza demonstrates how to prepare delicate samosa-like briouats with sweet and savoury fillings like spiced beef and rice with raisins, and a splash of orange blossom oil. ‘Not good,’ she tuts, like MasterChef judge Monica Galetti, at my attempt. High society, fine food: Nick enjoyed dinner on the rooftop of the Dar les Cigognes riad . Fouiza was taught to cook at the age of five by her grandmother. ‘My recipes have been passed down generations. They are all up here,’ she says, tapping her head.

"Two holidaymakers got the shock of their lives while taking a dip in Florida this week. People high up in a penthouse at the Silver Beach Towers in Destin, near Fort Walton Beach, spotted a shark approaching the couple. But despite screams and calls from the balcony for them to 'get out of the water', the pair did not hear. Video of the terrifying incident surfaced online this week. Terrifying: These two swimmers in Destin, Florida, came dangerously close to a shark earlier this week, which they did not realize was circling near them . Closer: The couple, who are in that is a little deeper than their knees, did not hear shouts of warning from people on the shore . Run: It is only after after the shark - believed to be a hammerhead - breaks the water that the pair run for it . Safe: It is believed the shark was hunting a stingray . According to the people recording, the shark is a hammerhead. Luckily for the swimmers, it appears to be hunting a nearby stingray. However the shark comes extremely close to the pair without them noticing. It is only when the suspected hammerhead causes a store in the water that the two realize what is happening right next to them. Much to the relief of the people filming, the couple then quickly run from the water, which is only knee-deep. Back out to sea: The shark moves to deeper water, appearing to have the stingray in its mouth . The shark then heads back out into the deep, appearing to have caught the stringray. Hammerheads can grow up to 20 feet long and of the 11 different species, only three have been known to attack humans, according to The New York Daily News.","Incident occurred earlier this week in Destin, near Fort Walton Beach .

Mr Wands, a keen surfer from Perth, Scotland, emigrated eight months ago to become a driller with a Norwegian oil company and pursue his love of surfing. He described the Wednesday morning encounter as 'the most frightening thing ever.' The surfer had just completed three to four waves when he spotted the tiger shark but did not know it was one of 13 feeding on the carcass of a dolphin. The shark circled Mr Wands and went under his board. He saw its head and tail and was 'petrified.' Man-eater: The tiger shark is the world's second most dangerous after the great white (library image) 'It . was a heart-stopping moment and was the meanest, nastiest, most . frightening thing ever,' Mr Wands said during interviews with Australian . television and radio. The tiger shark was within arm's reach . of him and at one point seemed to be coming straight for him so Mr Wands . got off his board and used it to try and defend himself. 'I saw it turn and it came straight for me, in a dead straight line, . undeviating, and it genuinely felt like a true final approach, as it . were. It definitely felt super-threatening and it wasn't changing its course . 'I . speared the board into the water to try and deter it. That seemed to . work but it came back again so I used the board again and it moved away. 'I was totally scared and definitely thought I would be coming out of the water with one appendage fewer.' Feeding frenzy: Tiger sharks patrol Trigg Beach and get just a few feet from the beach . Beneath the surface: A tiger shark lurks close to the shore off the coast of Western Australia . Mr Wands continued: 'I genuinely . think this thing was looking for a limb, if not more than that. If it . had struck blood my gut feeling is that might have encouraged the other . sharks to get involved as well, and then there might be a different . story today. 'Luckily . enough a wave happened to pitch up at the most convenient moment ever . and I just belly-flopped onto it and just ran it in on my front. This . was definitely a threat, I was utterly convinced.' He admitted the incident has put him off his hobby, and added: 'Next time, I may not be so lucky.' Mr Wands was brought up in Perth in Scotland with twin brother Christopher and sister Olivia. He took up surfing when he was eight while on regular summer holidays with his family in Caithness and has enjoyed the sport around the world, including Hawaii, Fiji and New Zealand. He . worked in the oil industry in Aberdeen but emigrated to Australia eight . months ago. His father Andrew, from Canisbay, yesterday spoke of his . relief that his son had escaped unscathed. Alert: A tiger shark fin cuts through the water at Trigg Beach, which was closed after the attack on Mr Wands . Raising the alarm: Officers have been patrolling beaches in the area to keep people out of the water . His son had contacted him to explain what had happened and assure him he was none the worse for his terrifying encounter. He said: 'I was a little bit surprised but just relieved he was okay. It must have been a scary experience.' Photographers have been capturing the feeding frenzy at Trigg Beach, where tiger sharks have been lurking just a few feet away from the shore.

"Jailed: Martin Counsell's home-made IED bombs and detonators were found in two garages he rented in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire . A 'crank' who triggered a terrorist alert when he made explosives to scare off burglars has been jailed today. Six hundred people had to be evacuated when Martin Counsell’s homemade IED bombs and detonators were found in two garages he rented in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. Counsell, 52, had alarmed neighbours by uploading a video showing an explosion in a residential . street, in the film is seen describing it as his 'application for joining Al Qaeda'. The Electrical engineer had told Gloucester Crown Court  the explosives were the cheapest way he could find . of making burglar deterrents at a time when he was £10,000 in debt and . could not afford an alarm. His IEDs were discovered because he had tried to make himself a fake MI6 identity card and he was interrogated for six days by anti-terrorist police after . his arrest. He had created the mini bombs with TATP (tri-acetone tri-peroxide), the same substance that was used in the London Tube bombings of July 7 2005, said prosecutor Lisa Hennessy. Jailing Counsell, who once ran his own burglar alarm company, Judge Jamie Tabor QC told him he was satisfied he had no connection with terrorism or political organisations. The judge said he also accepted that Counsell, an alcoholic with cirrhosis of the liver, was lonely and depressed after his wife left him and his business collapsed in 2010. 'As you became more isolated from society you became what the Victorians described as a crank. You had an obsessive fear of burglars,' said the judge. 'I am quite satisfied you gave a truthful account when you said you created these explosives to deter burglars. 'I am also satisfied you created them with the intention of scaring rather than injuring. ' The judge said he also believed Counsell’s explanation for trying to make himself an MI6 card - that he thought it would help him get treatment from a psychotherapist more quickly. 'But these were small quantities of volatile, sensitive and very dangerous material,' he said. Scroll down for video . 'Irresponsible': A clip from the video uploaded to YouTube called 'Home made bomb in Cheltenham' However, Judge Tabor said he did not accept . Counsell’s claim that the explosives were the cheapest way he could find . of making burglar deterrents. He said: 'You . chose to make explosives because you were bored and you were fascinated . by the whole process and I suspect regarded it as something of a . challenge. 'Your actions particularly in the present climate disturbed and frightened residents. 'Your . actions undermined their confidence causing them in some cases to be . really frightened and anxious and some remain so even to this day, as . witnessed by the fact that 200 people attended a public meeting arranged . by the police. That gives you some idea of the scale of fear you . caused. 'The thought of you, an alcoholic, working in your grubby garage creating dangerous explosives is very disturbing indeed.' Counsell had pleaded guilty to a charge that between September 1, 2011 and May 12, 2012 he had made TATP 'in circumstances to give rise to suspicion that he was not making it for a lawful object.' Mrs Hennessy had told the court 'When . Gloucestershire constabulary received a tip off from the Metropolitan . Police that a man in Gloucestershire was seeking to create a fake . identity card for MI6 they had little idea what they were to find. 'The man in question, Mr Counsell, had been buying various items on eBay that indicated he might be making explosive devices. 'Not only that, but he was definitely not an MI6 employee. When police searched Counsell's house on May 11 this year they found various items including a quantity of detonators. 'Hoax': A clip from the video showing an apparent explosion in a residential street . Mrs Henessy added: 'His internet . browsing history showed numerous searches dating from August 2011 on how . to make small bombs and and where to buy the ingredients. 'The police also discovered he had access to two garages in Buttermere close in Cheltenham. 'In . the first to be searched were four fully functional imporoved explosive . devices which were tested in controlled explosions and which exploded . with no difficulty. 'The . debris contained a substance called TATP which Counsell had mananged to . manufacture. This is a very sensitive high explosive which can be . detonated by static, spark, flame, impact or friction. It is not used . commercially because its storage qualities are poor and it is too . sensitive for safe use. 'It is worth noting that this compound was used in the London tube bombings on 7 July 2005. 'Also at the garage was a selection of chemicals and various detonators , presumably for use in making further IEDs. 'There was also what appeared to be a home made rocket launcher but which Mr Couonsell described as a potato gun.' Another detonator was found in the other garage nearby, she said. Counsell was interviewed for several . days by Counter Terrorist officers at Willenhall police syation and told . them he had made about ten of the devices and had tested five of them . in his back garden, said Mrs Hennessy. 'He said he had done this in order to . create booby traps for burglars after being frightened that someone had . got into his house when his dogs started barking in the night. 'The . police have no record of any report of bugrlary at his address. There . was also no security at the house - as Mr Counsell himself put it, the . back door was totally insecure, the house had no insurance because he . could not afford to pay for it and the front door was also inadequately . secured. A fence panel in the back garden was also missing. Blast: The man can be seen sprawling on the pavement after the package was supposedly detonated . 'There . was an alarm box on the house but it was not connected even though . Counsell had previously had his own alarm company. He said it was . because he had not got around to it because he was so depressed.' He . insisted that none of the devices would have caused injury - just a . loud bang which would have been enough to frighten any burglar away.' Counsell also told police that he wanted the MI6 card to help him get an appointment with a psychothersapist. And he said his alcoholic cirrhosis meant he had only a couple of years to live. The area around the garages had to be evacuated in a radius of 200 metres and six hundred people, including residents of a care home, had to get out of their homes, she added. The incident had caused such great concern that police held a public meeting to explain the situation to residents. 'There has been heightened tension between the local communities and efforts are continuing to bring this back to normal levels,' added Mrs Hennessy. She said the devices could cause the loss of one or more fingers if they went off in someone’s hand. They would cause superficial injujries if they exploded very close to a person. Lloyd Jenkins, defending, pointed out that Counsell is a man of previous good character but now ‘lonely after a catalogue of personal problems.’ The six days of intense interrogation he had received as a suspected terrorist had ‘turned his world upside down,’ Mr Jenkins said.

"The vast majority of Manchester United fans want David de Gea to sign a new contract rather than see him used in any swap deal for Gareth Bale, according to a new poll. De Gea put in another top-class performance on Saturday in United's 2-0 win at QPR. The Spaniard, who has 18 months left on his contract, has been linked with Real Madrid and reports over the weekend suggested the goalkeeper could be used in an exchange that would see Bale move to Old Trafford. Spanish goalkeeper David de Gea has been in imperious form for Manchester United this season . United supporters do not want De Gea to be part of a swap deal with Gareth Bale . The Manchester United Supporters' Trust have challenged Ed Woodward (pictured) to offer De Gea a new deal . The Manchester United Supporters' Trust (MUST) asked United fans what their preference would be in a poll on their Facebook page. MUST asked: 'If you had a straight choice to either keep David de Gea or sell him as part of a player exchange deal for Gareth Bale with Real Madrid, what would you choose to do?' Twelve hours after posing the question, MUST said 'over 99 per cent' of the 600-plus fans who responded said they would prefer to keep De Gea. 'With this in mind it signals the challenge (executive vice-chairman) Ed Woodward and (owners) the Glazers have to get Manchester United's most popular player signed up on a new contract, before Real Madrid attempt to prise him away,' a MUST spokesman said.","Of over 600 Manchester United fans polled, 99% want David de Gea to stay .

"Dolphins may have been swimming the Earth’s oceans for six million years longer than previously thought, suggests a new study. They are the most diverse family of living marine mammals and include species such as the bottlenose dolphin and the killer whale. However, their early evolution and fossil record has been steeped in mystery due to lack of good specimens. Scroll down for 3D animation of the skull . A new study has revealed that modern dolphins, like the bottlenose dolphin pictured here, have ancient ancestors that span back up to 13 million years. This is six million years further back than the first dolphins were thought to be alive . Now a new study, published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, has re-described the oldest species of dolphin with a new name: Eodelphis kabatensis. Bottlenose . dolphins typically live in pods of 10 to 30 members, but group size varies . from single individuals up to more than 1,000. Their diets consists mainly of fish, which they hunt together or individually. Dolphins . search for prey primarily using echolocation, which is similar to . sonar. They emit clicking sounds and listen for the return echos to . determine the location and shape of potential prey and other interesting . items. Research on bottlenose dolphins has examined mimicry, use of artificial language, object categorization, and self-recognition. They can use tools - known as sponging - and pass cultural knowledge down generations. Although the partial skull was previously described in the 1970s, researchers behind the new paper say the scientific community largely overlooked it. And the new re-description has important implications for the evolutionary history of dolphins. The skull of Eodelphis kabatensis was originally collected from a small tributary of the Oshirarika River on the island of Hakkaido, Japan. Researchers working on the specimen have narrowed its age to the late Miocene period, 13 to 8.5 million years ago, making it the earliest true dolphin species described. Lead author of the new study said lead author Mizuki Murakami said: 'The early evolution of true dolphins is still covered in mystery. 'Eodelphis kabatensis informs us about the morphology of early dolphins.' This is a computer-generated 3D CT image of the single fragment of the . skull that was found. Eodelphis is an important link in the evolutionary . history of dolphins that provides correlation between the fossil record . and molecular-based studies (credit: Mizuki Murakami) The discovery was made by studying a skull of an ancient species of dolphin now known as Eodelphis kabatensis, which was collected from a small tributary of the Oshirarika River in Hakkaido, Japan. Pictured is the skull recreated around the holotype, the sole 'piece' of the dolphin scientists have . Eodelphis is an important link in the evolutionary history of dolphins. Prior to the latest study, there was inconsistency between the fossil record of the dolphins and molecular-based studies. The oldest true dolphin fossils found were less than six million years old, while molecular studies suggested they originated and started to diversify between nine and 12 million years ago. Jonathan Geisler, a marine mammal paleontologist at the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine, said: 'Eodelphis kabatensis, being discovered from sediments that were deposited eight to 13 million years ago, has largely resolved this discrepancy and provides the best glimpse yet of what the skull of the first dolphins may have looked like.' In addition to its importance as the earliest true dolphin, the new study also incorporates the most comprehensive analysis of the relationships within the Delphinoidea, the group that encompasses toothed whales. By including Eodelphis in the analysis, the researchers were able to get a much clearer picture of the evolution of the toothed whales. And Dr Geisler said the presence of Eodelphis in the Pacific Ocean during the late Miocene has implications for the geographic history of dolphins. He said that while more specimens need to be discovered, the study suggests that dolphins might have had their origins in the Pacific.","Studies of a skull fragment have revealed it to be from an ancient dolphin .

"These extraordinary pictures show a South African seal devouring a blue shark - one of five that it attacked and ate for dinner. The rare event took place off the coast of Cape Point and was witnessed and photographed by a group of shocked divers. The seal ate only the stomach and liver of its prey before moving on to its next victim. Carnage: A Cape fur seal grabs a blue shark in its jaws as it dines on five of the deep sea predators . 'It was terrible to watch,' said South African photographer Chris Fallows, who owns a  shark diving company. He had been taking a group on an expedition when they found the sharks, which were all around three or four feet long (1.1 to 1.4 metres). 'Suddenly a large Cape fur seal arrived and proceeded to catch and kill its first, then second shark,' he said. It ate a further two in quick succession, before another shark drew its attention an hour later and it pounced once more. 'This was too much for us,' said Mr Fallows. 'We moved about three miles away. We certainly did not want to attract . any more sharks to this seal.' Stopping for a bite: Seals compete for food with fishermen, and this one is big enough to beat its toothy target . The photographer said it was the second time he has seen a seal attacking and killing a blue shark, but he has never heard anyone else describe the event. Fur seals have sharp eyesight, keen hearing and can grow to nine feet (3m) long, weighing up to 700lb (315kg). It can live for up to 30 years, either gathering in small groups or swimming alone. Many fur seal populations have not rebounded from extensive hunting - and now have to cope with overfishing, which can limit their prey. The African fur seal lives around the southern and southwestern coast of Africa, while the Australian sub-species lives in Bass Strait, off Victoria in south-east Australia and off Tasmania. An African fur seal’s diet is thought to be 70 per cent fish, 20 per cent squid and 2 per cent crab, although it will eat many other things it finds, including crustaceans, cephalopods and sometimes birds. African fur seals can dive as deep as 204m and for as long as 7.5 minutes. He suspects the seal only ate the . stomach because it would have contained fish or squid, which form seal’s preferred diet, and the liver would have been a good source of energy. 'I guess it . just ate the parts that gave it the most use,' he said. The pictures come on the same day as images of a fur seal chewing on a Maori octopus, known locally as 'The Kraken', off the coast of Australia. Photographer Phil Davison captured the rare sighting in Rye pier on the Mornington Peninsula, while out with a group of open-water scuba divers. Callan Duck, a senior research scientist at the University of St Andrews' Sea Mammal Research Unit, said: 'It's usually the other way around. There is a lot of footage of great whites eating seals, particularly pups who stray into their paths. 'Seal normally eat fish, and the usual diet for a Cape fur seal would be one of two species of hake.' One of these species has great commercial value so the seal is in competition with fishermen when it comes to catching them. Mr Duck added: 'It may be that there are not many photos of this happening, but that doesn't mean sharks cannot be part of a seal's normal diet. 'Cape fur seal can weigh up to 700lbs (300 kilos). It's a question of size. If you are smaller than me, I will eat you.' The sharks are likely to have been males, which are smaller than the females at around 6ft long and just 60 to 120lbs. Mr Fallows added: 'If karma does . indeed exist, the seal had better watch out if it returns during the . great whites’ winter hunting season.'","Seals usually feed on fish, squid and crab, but will eat what they can find .

The appearance gave Obama ample opportunity to plug her Let's Move! initiative, which aims to end childhood obesity through exercise and healthy eating. Inspired, Poehler's character decides to take the new position with the National Park Service and move to the Windy City. But in a last minute twist, it's revealed that she convinced her new bosses to move the national headquarters to Pawnee so she can stay in her beloved hometown. Obama was just one cameo in an episode packed with surprise guest appearances from stars like Ginuwine, who performed at the Pawnee/Eagleton Unity Concert as a favor for cousin Donna. Thanks to Obama's advice, Poehler's character took a new job but managed to stay in her beloved hometown of Pawnee . He dedicated his 1996 hit 'Pony' to the town's deceased mascot, pony Little Sebastian. Also performing were The Decemberists and 90s alt-rockers Letters to Cleo. Mad Men star Jon Hamm even stopped by as an inept employee Poehler fires three years after taking the new job, now married to Ben, triplets at her side. While fans have said the packed show felt more like a series finale than the end to a season, Parks and Recreation will return for at least one more year.","Obama encourages Leslie Knope to take job at National Park Service in Chicago .

"A sham wedding couple used crib sheets to memorise facts about each other before tying the knot in a bogus ceremony set up by a fixer, a court heard. Moroccan Zakaria Azzouzi married Petra Tatalova, from Slovakia, in an attempt to stay in Britain after his visa expired. The fraud went undetected for eight months - until police raided the house of the fixer who had arranged the fake marriage and found the notes used by the couple to learn their lines. The crib sheet reminded them that the bride's star sign is scorpio, the groom's favourite food is couscous and they supposedly met in a coffee shop. Happy couple? Petra Tatalova and Zakaria Azzouzi entered into a sham marriage to help him stay in Britain . Jailed: Azzouzi has been given a 21-month prison sentence while Tatalova was jailed for 12 months . Student Azzouzi, 24, was yesterday . jailed for 21 months for his part in the scam, while Tatalova, 32, an . events manager, was sentenced to 12 months in prison. The 'couple' wed at Barnet registry . office in north London in March 2011, because Azzouzi needed to marry an . EU citizen to avoid being deported from the UK when his visa expired. They claimed that had met in a coffee shop on Oxford Street in June 2010 and had been living together for six months before the wedding. But in fact, they were introduced by 'fixer' Mourad Nabil, 43, who was described by a judge at St Albans Crown Court as having a 'Svengali-like malign influence' over the bride. When police raided Nabil's home in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire they discovered notes helping Azzouzi and Tatalova learn facts about each other in order to convince officials that their marriage was genuine. At the bottom of the crib sheet, Nabil had written: 'That is about it honey.. try memorising these information sweety,, just in case.. you know me I am always thourough.. [sic]'. Crib sheet: The pair were discovered when police found this sheet telling them facts about each other . Nabil, 43, who was earlier convicted of an £18,500 benefit fraud, was sentenced to two years in prison. Laura . Blackband, prosecuting, told the couple that the three defendants went . to the registry office a month before the wedding to answer questions . about their relationship, with Nabil claiming to act as their . interpreter. However, . when the crib sheets were discovered later that year it became clear . that the wedding was in fact 'a sham, bogus marriage', she continued. 'Mr . Azzouzi's mother organised with Mr Nabil that he would secure a fake . marriage so he could stay here as the husband of an EU national,' Ms . Blackband said. 'It was an entire put-up job planned for Mr Azzouzi to . stay in this country when his visa ran out in May 2011.' She said that Tatalova, who first came to Britain in 2000, had previously been in a relationship with Nabil. When . he was questioned by police, Nabil said he had been 'intimate' with the . bride but said that she had introduced Azzouzi to him as her boyfriend, . adding that he did not get on with the groom. 'He . accepted they were an odd couple,' Ms Blackband said. 'Mr Azzouzi was . eight years younger and a Muslim from Morocco, and she was a Christian . from Slovakia. 'He said it was a genuine marriage and that he had assisted with the preparations because Mr Azzouzi had a terrible memory.' Scam: Mourad Nabil, left, set up the fake wedding for Azzouzi, centre, and Tatalova, right . Tatalova told the police she met Azzouzi in Cafe Nero or Costa Coffee and that he had proposed to her on her birthday, sending her a card with the words 'Will you marry me?' written inside. She also said it was a genuine marriage, but said he had 'upped and gone' and she did not know where he was. Azzouzi had been arrested in Manchester for an unrelated offence around the time of the raid on Nabil's house - he originally stuck to the story, but once he was shown the crib sheet he confessed it was a sham marriage. Tatalova, Azzouzi and and Nabil all pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to breach immigration laws by arranging a bogus marriage, but were convicted by a jury. An earlier trial began in December 2012, but was stopped when Azzouzi's mother was denied a visa to enter Britain and testify as a defence witness. Azzouzi is set to be deported to Morocco immediately owing to the time he has already spent in jail and on an electronic tag. Tatalova's lawyer said yesterday: 'It is a sad and desperate case for her. There was no gain in financial terms. The only explanation is that it was a misguided attempt by Miss Tatalova to assist. She paid the wedding expenses. 'She is ashamed to be here and is ashamed by the finding of the jury. She has always worked and never claimed benefit.' Judge Stephen Gullick said: 'The sole purpose of the sham marriage was to allow Azzouzi to remain in the UK through his marriage to an EU national. This was a family-organised wedding orchestrated by Nabil.' He told Tatalova: 'Why you became involved only you know. You have put all you have achieved in complete jeopardy by agreeing to go through this sham marriage. ' Paul Whitehead, from the Home Office's Criminal and Financial Investigations Team, said:  'Our discovery of the crib sheet was crucial to the investigation, blowing a hole in any claims to credibility that the defendants may have had.

"Ed Woodward, executive vice-chairman of Manchester United, became the highest-paid club administrator in English football during his difficult first year at Old Trafford. United accounts for the year ending June 2014 lodged at Companies House reveal Woodward, who took over from David Gill in July 2013, was paid a whopping £2.521million. Woodward was top of the Premier League chief executive rich list despite struggling in the transfer window at the start of former manager David Moyes’s time in charge and facing considerable criticism for the way Moyes’s departure after 10 months was handled. The only other Premier League club official definitely paid more than £2m is Arsenal’s Ivan Gazidis, who received £2.19m. Manchester City’s Ferran Soriano is likely to be a £2m-a-year chief but City’s accounts are less transparent.

BT Sport are confident they will sign Gary Lineker to present Champions League football next season irrespective of whether BBC lose Premier League highlights to ITV in the upcoming auction. Sportsmail revealed this month that Lineker was being chased by BT Sport but it was thought any deal depended on the fate of Match of the Day. However, BT are hopeful they will land Lineker even if it means a renegotiation of the contract that gives BBC exclusivity on him in the domestic TV market until 2016. Broadcast magazine also said Lineker was in ‘serious discussions with BT’ but a BT spokeswoman said talk around Lineker was ‘speculation’.

The shortlist for the vacant FA chief executive’s position is understood to contain a strong female candidate. This follows headhunters Odgers checking with the FA that they were happy to have both male and female contenders go forward to next month’s interview stage. The quandary for the FA is how long they are prepared to wait for their preferred choice, although sources say that would be as long as necessary if there is a stand-out candidate. That could point to the combative Debbie Jevans, chief executive of England Rugby 2015, being on the list. She would not be available until after the World Cup in November.

Chelsea, whose proposed £25million-a-year shirt sponsorship with Turkish Airlines has been delayed for some months, discovered at the Football Writers’ Association tribute evening to Didier Drogba what they could be missing out on. The airline, whose seven-figure personal backing of Drogba goes straight to his charity foundation, contributed to the evening by holding a draw - with mocked-up boarding passes on each seat - for two return flights to anywhere in the world. Alas, Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck did not have the winning ticket. The Sports PR Company, who represent Drogba, have split with Tour de France winner Chris Froome, whose feisty wife Michelle wants to handle her husband’s media activities. The cycling press had been at odds with the company, who insisted on copy approval for Froome interviews.

"Nearly 900,000 people who are either fit for work or capable of preparing for it have been claiming out-of-work benefits for three out of the last four years, according to figures released today. A  further 117,000 are still under assessment. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith says that more than four out of ten work-related benefits are claimed by the long-term unemployed. His new report, released today, will fuel controversy about welfare spending at a time when the Tories are imposing restrictions on what people can claim in state handouts. Welfare spending: More than four out of ten work-related benefits are claimed by the long-term unemployed, according to a report due to be published today . It will reinforce Mr Duncan Smith’s claims that longterm worklessness is major contributor to social breakdown and poverty. Ministers have come under fire from Labour for capping total benefits at £26,000 a year per household and forcing those on Incapacity Benefit and its replacement Employment Support Allowance to undergo health tests to assess their readiness for work. The report says: ‘On 31st March 2012, . there were 2.3 million claims for benefits that indicate a capacity for . work or work-related activity. ‘One million of those were from people who had been claiming one or more of the main working-age benefits for at least three out of the preceding four years.’ Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the figures showed that bringing in charities and private firms to help families with little history of work and to assess people for their fitness to work was the right move . According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, social security spending will rise from £180billion this year to nearly £198billion in 2017/18. The report, published to mark the first anniversary of the Government’s social justice strategy, also lays bare shocking figures about family breakdown. Five disabled people have lost their High Court challenge over the Government’s decision to abolish a scheme that helps them live independently. Their lawyers asked Mr Justice Blake, sitting in London, to declare 'unlawful' the consultation process that led to the proposed axing of the £320m Independent Living Fund (ILF). Bur the judge dismissed the application, insisting the consultation process had been lawful. The five are among 19,000 people who currently receive money from the ILF, which the Government plans to scrap in 2015. The average payout is £300 a week per recipient. The money enables them to employ personal assistants to help them with their personal needs and, they say, to 'go out and have a full life'. Two out of three children aged 12 to 16 in low-income households are no longer living with both their birth parents. By contrast, more than six out of ten children in middle to high income households are living with their parents, while just 39 per cent are not. The figures highlight the scale of entrenched social breakdown that has taken hold across Britain over the last decade, particularly in households living on benefits. In total, around a third of all children are not living with both birth parents. The report said that of the 2.3 million benefit claimants capable of some work-related activity, around one million had been 'stuck' on a working-age benefit for at least three of the past four years. 'Nothing illustrates more clearly than these statistics that we must continue focusing our efforts on families and communities where worklessness has become a way of life,' the report said. 'By reforming the benefits system we will transform the way people think about work, incentivising them to take the step into employment, knowing they will be better off compared to remaining on benefits.' The report concludes: ‘Children growing up in low income households are twice as likely not to be living with both birth parents as children in middle to high income households.’ The study – Social Justice: Transforming Lives – also says that thousands of parents who fear family breakdown have used couples counselling. The DWP says local authorities have already turned around the lives of 1,675 troubled families. The report also looks at the gap in educational attainment between rich and poor pupils. In 2011-2012, 16.8 per cent fewer pupils on free school meals achieved good grades than those who were better off. The social justice strategy set out a series of targets to tackle the root causes of disadvantage, including family stability, worklessness and drug and alcohol addiction. The clampdown on out-of-work benefits is part of a raft of changes the government is introducing to curb steep rises in the UK's benefits bill . More than half of the 56,000 families affected by the benefits cap have four or more children, according to estimates by the Department for Work and Pensions . Mr Duncan Smith said the new figures showed that bringing in charities and private firms to help families with little history of work and to assess people for their fitness to work was the right move. He added: ‘This approach starts with the family, the foundation of our society. Prioritising children’s formative years, we are taking action to prevent social problems from arising in the first place, supporting the strong relationships which we know offer children the best start in life. ‘We are prioritising children’s formative years and supporting strong, stable family relationships which we know offer children the best start in life.’ Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne said the findings should be a 'wake-up call' to ministers. He added: 'This new report is a damning verdict on this Government's disastrous economic policies and Iain Duncan Smith's abject failure to get a grip of unemployment. His own figures in his own report have proved this Government is useless. 'In the three years since the election, unemployment hasn't gone down, its gone up and the welfare bill with it. Across Britain, long term unemployment has spiralled as the work programme has proved worse than doing nothing and universal credit is hit by delay after delay. We need to get these people off benefits and into jobs. We cannot stand by and watch another generation dumped on the scrap-heap like the 1980s. We must act and act now to get people into work.' TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: 'It’s tragic to see the Work and Pensions Secretary once again peddling myths about benefits in order to provide cover for more austerity and his own failure to tackle rising unemployment. 'The fact is that the majority of the million benefit claimants that he believes are ‘fit to work’ have either been declared not-yet fit-to-work by his own department, or are lone parents with children below school age, who will struggle to find work given the high cost of childcare. 'The Work and Pensions Secretary should spend less time wasting taxpayers’ money on bogus benefits propaganda and more time getting to grips with the real issue of rising unemployment, particularly the one million young people currently struggling for work.' An earlier version of this article said that one million people claiming out-of-work b enefits are 'fit' to work'.  This was based on statistics provided by the Department of Work and Pensions at the time but has now been updated.","4 out of 10 work-related benefits claimed by long-term unemployed .

"Shi'te Muslim Iran is so alarmed by Sunni insurgent gains in Iraq that it may be willing to cooperate with Washington in helping Baghdad fight back, a senior Iranian official told Reuters today. The idea is being discussed internally among the Islamic Republic's leadership, the senior Iranian official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official had no word on whether the idea had been raised with any other party. Officials say Iran will send its neighbor advisers and weaponry, although probably not troops, to help its ally and Iraq's Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki check what Tehran sees as a profound threat to regional stability, officials and analysts say. Scroll down for video . Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, pictured here on Monday in Turkey with Turkish President Abdulah Gul, promised 'constructive engagement' with the world when he was elected.

Islamist militants have captured swathes of territory including the country's second biggest city Mosul. Tehran is open to the possibility of working with the United States to support Baghdad, the senior official said. 'We can work with Americans to end the insurgency in the Middle East,' the official said, referring to events in Iraq. 'We are very influential in Iraq, Syria and many other countries.' For many years, Iran has been aggrieved by what it sees as U.S. efforts to marginalize it. Tehran wants to be recognized as a significant player in regional security.

Trail of destruction: Militants of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant damage a patrol car of Iraq army in the city of Mosul . Relations between Iran and Washington have improved modestly since the 2013 election of President Hassan Rouhani, who promised 'constructive engagement' with the world. And while Tehran and the United States pursue talks to resolve the Islamic state's decade-old nuclear standoff with the West, they also acknowledge some common threats, including the rise of al Qaeda-style militancy across the Middle East. On Thursday, President Barack Obama said the United States was not ruling out air strikes to help Baghdad fight the insurgents, in what would be the first U.S. armed intervention in Iraq since the end of the U.S.-led war. Rouhani on Thursday strongly condemned what he called violent acts by insurgent groups in the Middle East. 'Today, in our region, unfortunately, we are witnessing violence, killing, terror and displacement,"" Rouhani said. 'Iran will not tolerate the terror and violence ... we will fight against terrorism, factionalism and violence.'

"A dramatic rise in killer attacks by dolphins on porpoises is baffling scientists in one of Britain's main breeding seas. The calm waters of Cardigan Bay in Wales have been turned red in recent weeks by bottlenose dolphins killing smaller porpoises during deadly clashes. Marine scientists are struggling to understand why the rare attacks have been on the rise - with three out of the four attacks proving fatal. A dramatic rise in killer attacks by dolphins on porpoises (shown) is baffling scientists in one of Britain's main breeding seas. The calm waters of Cardigan Bay have been turned red in recent weeks by bottlenose dolphins killing smaller porpoises during deadly clashes . The harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), which has been the subject of the dolphin attacks, is one of six species of porpoise. It is one of the smallest marine mammals and typically stays close to the coast or in river estuaries. The creature gets its name from Medieval Latin poropiscus, which means pig fish. Harbour porpoises have been known to dive 720 feet (220 metres) and can hold their breath for up to five minutes. Up . until 2008, scientists were baffled about why quite large numbers of . the small marine mammals were found dead - and the U.S. navy was even . blamed for scores of dead porpoises in Virginia. But . then tell-tale teeth marks were identified and examinations of the . harbour porpoises' bodies revealed broken ribs, imploding lungs and . internal bleeding, from prolonged dolphin attacks, The Telegraph reported. Most cases of the attacks have been documented along the east coast of Scotland and off the coast of Virginia. Researchers at the Cardigan Bay Marine Wildlife Centre (CBMWC) said they have always known dolphins attack porpoises, but that the frequency of recent attacks is alarming. Volunteers at CBMWC, in Ceredigion, West Wales, rescued a porpoise stranded on the beach in May after being chased by dolphins. Last month researchers witnessed three dolphins killing a porpoise - with another fatal attack a week later. Then last week three dolphins spent 20 minutes brutally attacking a porpoise close to the centre's research vessel. The bottlenose dolphins repeatedly pounced on the porpoise, forcing it underwater then throwing it in the air close to the boat. 'One of the dolphins in particular was attacking the porpoise while the others joined in from time to time,' said researcher Milly Metcalfe. 'Although we were close by, they took no notice of us, intent on the attack.' The crew pulled the porpoise's battered body on board their research vessel and found blood coming from its mouth - suggesting it may have had punctured lungs or other internal injuries. Cardigan Bay is home to Europe's largest resident population of dolphins - who share the sheltered waters with smaller harbour porpoises. Marine scientists are struggling to understand why the rare attacks have been on the rise. Researchers at the Cardigan Bay Marine Wildlife Centre said they have always known dolphins attack porpoises but the frequency of recent attacks is alarming. Pictured here shows a dolphin attacking a small porpoise . Last month researchers witnessed three dolphins killing a porpoise - with another fatal attack a week later. Then last week three dolphins spent 20 minutes brutally attacking a porpoise close to the centre's research vessel. The Bottlenose dolphins repeatedly pounced on the porpoise. Pictured is another dolphin attack . Scientist Sarah Perry said she had been left baffled by the recent spate of deadly attacks. 'One possibility is that they see the porpoises as competitors for food, especially if there's a shortage of prey in the area,' she said. 'Although porpoises normally go for smaller prey, dolphins will eat anything. 'However there's been no other indication recently of any shortage.' Another theory is that a low number of females is prompting the attacks by males. Male dolphins have been known to kill young dolphins in order to mate with the calf's mother. Porpoises are similar in size to a dolphin calf. The centre said it is unclear which dolphins have been responsible for the attacks. Ms Perry added: 'One animal we're familiar with, Nick, a female, was seen in the area when we rescued the porpoise last month, and she was also seen nearby in last week's attack. 'Our records show that she's been seen before with the animals we think were responsible for the attack, so it may even be that she's teaching the others.' Science officer Sarah Perry said she had been left baffled by the recent spate of deadly attacks. 'One possibility is that they see the porpoises as competitors for food, especially if there's a shortage of prey in the area,' she said. Another theory is that low numbers of females is prompting the attacks by males .","Dramatic rise in fatal dolphin attacks on porpoises has left scientists puzzled .
The attacks have been occurring at Cardigan Bay in Wales for weeks .
Three out of four of the brutal attacks on the porpoises have been fatal .
One explanation could be a shortage of prey in the area, with porpoises being seen as competitors to the dolphins .
A low number of females could also be making males more violent ."
"Saved: The eight-month old female harbor seal, known as Pup 49, had to have a flipper amputated to save her life . She may have one less flipper - but this young seal has plenty to smile about after her life was saved by vets following a brutal attack. The eight-month-old, known as Pup 49, was found badly injured on a Massachusetts beach following a fight with another seal. Her horrific injuries included deep cuts all over her body which became seriously infected. She is now getting used to her new life with one less rear flipper at the Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut after vets were forced to remove one to stop the infection spreading through her body. The plucky pup's strength has nearly returned but she is still coming to terms with the amputation - occasionally swimming to the platform's edge and trying to haul herself from the water, ABC news reports. Workers at the aquarium have even installed a special ramp to help the pup get out of her pool. But things could have turned out very differently for the inquisitive creature, after she was left on the brink of death following a battle with an older seal off the New England coast. She was found stranded and emaciated in Plymouth  Massachusetts last July. The seal, which was named Pup 49 after the ID number she was given when rescued, was also struggling to breath properly due to the impact of her wounds and infection. The decision to amputate her flipper was made after vets found the infection had spread to her bones - putting her life in danger. Scroll down for video: .

"Christians may have to sacrifice their jobs if they want to express their religion at work, government lawyers declared yesterday. They urged human rights judges in Strasbourg to reject a landmark case brought by four Christians who said they suffered faith-based discrimination. The state lawyers insisted workers . are not entitled to wear a crucifix at work against the wishes of their . employers – and if that is incompatible with their faith they ‘are free . to resign’. Scroll down for video . Britain's Nadia Eweida waits for the beginning of the hearing on her case with three other British nationals at the European Human Rights Court in Strasbourg yesterday . The hard line contrasts starkly with . David Cameron telling the Commons in July that the right to wear the . cross at work was ‘an absolutely vital freedom’. He even pledged to change the law to ‘make clear that people can wear religious symbols at work.’ Last night the Government’s handling of the case was attacked by Christians for its ‘astonishing double standards’. Government lawyers said the wearing . of the crucifix was not a ‘scriptural requirement’ of Christianity, so . employers had no obligation to recognise it. Nadia Eweida sits besides Bishop Athanasios Canepa, as she waits for the beginning of the hearing .

Former Islington registrar Lilian Ladele, left, who was sacked after declining to conduct civil partnerships, and Shirley Chaplin, a nurse of 30 years who was told that she could no longer wear her cross to work, were also involved in yesterday's case in Strasbourg .

Nadia Eweida, Shirley Chaplin, Lilian Ladele and Gary McFarlane (pictured clockwise) who launched a landmark case on religious freedom at the European Court of Human Rights yesterday . The case comes at a time when senior . Christian leaders, including the archbishops of the Church of England . and the Pope, have complained that Christianity is being pushed out of . public life in Britain. Paul Diamond, for Mrs Chaplin and Mr . McFarlane, said: ‘These are real people, real lives, real damage . suffered. There is no knowing where this will end as society moves in a . secular direction. The situation in the UK is now critical.’ But James Eadie QC, acting for the . Government, told the judges that none of the four Christians had . suffered any form of discrimination. ‘There is a difference between the . professional sphere where your religious beliefs conflict with other . interests and the private sphere,’ he said. ‘Everyone has the right to express . their beliefs, including the right to display religious symbols, but not . an absolute right or a right without limits. That does not mean that in . their professional sphere anyone can manifest their religious belief in . any way they choose.’ He said that under European human rights rules, . people were allowed to practise their religion in a ‘generally . recognised form’. However, they could not ask to express their religion . in ways which were not a ‘scriptural requirement’. Prime Minister David Cameron told the House of Commons earlier this year that the right to wear the cross at work was 'an absolutely vital freedom' He said: ‘Employees are free to . resign if they find their employment incompatible with their religious . beliefs’, adding: ‘They can obtain alternative employment in which they . can reflect their religion as they wish.’ In the case of Miss Eweida, 61, from Twickenham, south-west London, . wearing a cross was ‘a personal expression of faith and not a response . to a scriptural command’. Mrs Chaplin, 57, he added, had been . told not to wear her cross because of new health and safety rules at . Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital. Of registrar Miss Ladele, Mr Eadie . said Islington believed same-sex couples should have equal access to . services and ‘this is a legitimate, even a weighty, aim for a public . authority’. For Miss Eweida, James Dingemans said . that BA allowed Muslims to wear hijabs, Sikhs to wear turbans and . bracelets, and Jews to wear skull caps. Last night Andrea Minichiello .

"Despite months of complaints from users about how alike Twitter and Facebook are becoming, the blogging site is powering on with its changes. Under its latest redesign, users can now highlight, or 'pin', tweets to the top of their profile, add larger profile pictures and customise their header images. Twitter has also added filters to control what kind of tweets appear, including tweets with photos and tweets with replies. Scroll down for video . As part of its latest redesign, Twitter users can now pin tweets to the top of their profile, add larger profile pictures, and customise their header images. Tweets that have received the most retweets or interactions now appear larger on a person's profile. Michelle Obama's Twitter account pictured features the new look . Some users have had a number of these features - namely the new header and profile image - for a while, during Twitter's testing phase, while others will not be familiar with them. ‘Moment by moment, your Twitter profile shows the world who you are,’ explained Twitter designer David Bellona in a blog post. ‘Starting today, it will be even easier (and, we think, more fun) to express yourself through a new and improved web profile.’ The new look lets users add a larger profile picture, customise their header image, and highlight their best tweets - all features similar to those found on Facebook. Tweets that have received the most retweets, interactions or favourites now appear larger on a person’s profile, making popular content easier to find. New users will see the updated profile design straight away and it will be rolled out to current users 'in the coming weeks'. Notable tweeters to already have the new look, in addition to Michelle Obama, include Channing Tatum, pictured, and John Legend . The new design follows a number of changes. In March, for example, Twitter posted a blog announcing a new range of photo options. Users can now add up to four pictures in each tweet. The firm also added the ability to tag up to ten friends in a photo, without using up any of the tweets 140 characters . Users can also now pin tweets to the top of their profile, that act in a similar way to Facebook status updates, to show ‘followers what you’re all about’. Facebook has a similar 'Highlight' feature that members use to promote certain posts, or make photo posts larger, for example. Finally, Twitter has introduced Filtered Tweets meaning users can choose which timeline to view when checking out people’s profiles. Earlier this year, Twitter rolled out the new design to select users and it was criticised for closely resembling how Facebook profiles look. Images are larger, while text-based tweets are made smaller, and where appropriate, cards are positioned in columns similar to Facebook's Highlights profile design, pictured . During testing of this redesign, the photos and videos box on the old left-hand panel was removed and a new category tab was created on individual profiles to showcase this content. These now appear to have been a precursor to the latest filters, pictured . Filters include tweets, tweets with photos or videos, and tweets with replies. The redesign was officially revealed on the Today show in the U.S, by Carson Daly. New users will see the updated profile design straight away, and it will be rolled out to current users ‘in the coming weeks.’ As . well as the Today show’s account, notable other tweeters to get the new . look including Channing Tatum, Michelle Obama and John Legend. These changes are the latest in a long line of tweaks gradually being rolled out to the site. Twitter is still unique in the way it shows posts in chronological reverse order and its character limit. The imitation goes both ways, too - in June last year, Facebook added a Twitter-style hashtag tool to its site. Earlier this year, Twitter rolled out the new design to select users and it was criticised for closely resembling how Facebook profiles look. The . most noticeable change was the size of the cover photo. Twitter added . the feature initially during a redesign in September 2012, five months . after Facebook included it as part of its Timeline rejig. Twitter . cover photos now appear full-width along the top of the screen, and the . profile picture that used to sit in the centre of this cover image was . moved to the left-hand side. In . line with this change, a user's bio that traditionally appeared inside . the cover photo has also been moved to below the profile picture.

"A virus that has killed nearly 800 dolphins has now shown up in four whales, which washed ashore off the East Coast of America. Government marine experts are working to determine whether the virus - cetacean morbillivirus - was responsible for the deaths. If proven, the development would be of major concern to the global whale population, judging by the amount of dolphins the virus continues to kill. Three humpback whales - which are listed as an endangered species - and one pygmy sperm whale have stranded since July 1. They were found on shores between Massachusetts and Georgia, according to the Washington Post. Troubling: Three humpback whales - like this one - and one pygmy sperm whale have washed ashore infected with crustacean morbillivirus, a virus responsilbe for the death of close to 800 dolphins. Experts are now trying to determine whether the virus was the cause of death for the whales . Just this year, there have been 14 whale strandings, which is double the six-year average of seven. This whale was found near Ocean Shores, Washington, on June 13, 2013 . East Coast: The four infected whales washed ashore on the East Coast of the United States between Massachusetts and Georgia . There have been 14 humpback strandings - when dead or dying animals wash ashore - along the East Coast this year, which is double the six-year average of seven. However only four of the whales have been proven carriers of morbillivirus. While morbillivirus is known to infect whales, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have never reported a death from it. The dolphin epidemic, however, continues to move at an unprecedented rate. Between July 1 and Sunday, 782 have been confirmed dead. That already surpasses the last major morbillivirus outbreak in 1987, when 740 were confirmed dead. Third of the day: Virginia Aquarium Stranding Response Team members Liz Schell (left) and Krystal Rodrique (right) record their third deceased dolphin in Ocean View Beach in Norfolk, Virginia on Aug. 1, 2013 . Sarah Rose from the Virginia Aquarium Stranding Response Team  prepares for a necropsy on a dolphin that died from morbillivirus . The virus causes death by suppressing the dolphin's immune system, leaving them vulnerable to infections such as pneumonia. Despite a similarity to the measles virus, it poses no threat to humans. Sadly officials have said there is nothing they can do to protect dolphins in the wild. Another round of dolphins have recently washed ashore in Florida, as they migrate south to warmer weather. However they have not been included in the virus tally because proper tests have not been conducted. Danielle Monaghan, a staffer at the Marine Mammal Stranding Center in Brigantine, New Jersey, photographs a dead dolphin that washed ashore on Aug. 21, 2013, in Spring Lake. This dolphin was the 63rd to die on New Jersey's shores since July . Teri Rowles, director of the marine mammal heath and stranding response program for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's fisheries service, said it is too early to say whether whales are able to be infected. 'There are too many unknowns right now,' she told the Washington Post. 'We would be concerned if indeed there is an outbreak of this virus in humpback whales causing clinical disease and mortality.'","A strand of the morbillivirus - which causes measles in humans - is responsible for wiping out 782 since July, with the number expected to rise .

"These pictures show the latest abuse suffered by a group of helpless seals on a San Diego beach. They show three men approaching and harassing the mammals as they try to rest at the 'Children's Pool' in La Jolla - in two separate incidents. This comes after the city's mayor made the beach off-limits at night following an earlier attack on the seals by two young women who were seen kicking and punching them. The incidents, captured on a webcam, suggest the creatures suffer regular abuse from humans. Scroll down for video: . Incident: A man harasses a seal resting at the Children's Pool in La Jolla, California. The incident, captured on webcam, follows an earlier attack on the mammals by two women . Video:  Two men are seen harassing seals in a separate incident captured on film. The beach is closed to the public at night . The attacks have been captured on round-the-clock 'Seal Cam' was set up at the Children's Pool in La Jolla to capture the dozens of seals on film. But . rather than just attracting nature enthusiasts it also attracted the . police after the vicious attack on the mammals by two young women . was caught on film. The women were filmed sitting on the . seals, pulling their flippers and kicking them during the incident on . January 24 before the animals rush into the water to escape the abuse. One of the pair takes photographs as the other continues to hurt the animals. Activists say rather than a rare . event - the abuse of seals is commonplace. Though no similar evidence . exists of violence, videos captured by the Save La Jolla Seals group . show families closely approaching and scaring the animals, children kicking sand at the creatures and divers them and causing visible distress. Shocking: The footage of the two abusers horrified the La Jolla community and has caused a night time ban on people accessing the Children's Pool area . Many La Jolla locals are unhappy about restricted access to certain parts of the beach by Mayor Bob Filner . Abuse of the seals appears to have become a common feature at the beach. Seal Cam observer Sarah Wan . wrote: 'We had our first pup born today and it was something special. This evening mother took it for a short swim. Earlier today the pup tried to figure out what a sea gull was. Unfortunately, this afternoon someone threw sand into the pups eyes. Really terrible.' Nasty verbal altercations have taken . place near the spot between the seal activists who want people barred from . going on the beach and those that support mixed use. Mayor Bob . Filner introduced new rules banning people from going onto the beach between . sunset and sunrise until the end of the pupping season in May. 'I felt it was important to take this step after evidence of individuals . seen on video tape, harassing, taunting and causing stress to the seals . at the Children’s Pool in La Jolla,' he said in a statement. 'The behavior was shocking, . reprehensible and certainly not a reflection of how most citizens in our . fine city believe animals should be treated.' A rope is currently up at the beach to stop visitors getting too . close during the birthing season and a park ranger and police patrols . have also been introduced to ensure visitors respect the animals. However, many closely approach the creatures regardless to get holiday snaps and . many divers swim onto the beach alarming seals and causing them to rush . into the water. Pupping season: A Harbor Whale mother is seen attending to her new born at the Children's Pool, La Jolla. Various cases of disruption of the animals have been reported . Resting: Harbor seals are supposed to be protected on the beach, but many people ignore the rope and signs . Disruptive: There is an ongoing debate in the local area over whether the beach can be used by both humans and seals . The two rival camps have long been at war over the beach with many . saying activists put off visitors who just want to respectfully observe . the animals at a beach originally designated for children's use. However, the shocking abuse in January appears to have bolstered support for measures to further support the . animals. Larry Wan of the Western Alliance for Nature which oversees the web-cam told MailOnline: 'I think the beach closure is absolutely necessary and a step in the right direction. 'We are very thankful to Mayor Filner who appreciates the seals and wants to provide meaningful protection for them.  Unfortunately, the incident seen of the two women harassing the seals is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the harassment of seals on this beach.' Bryan Pease, a . lawyer who represents the Animal Protection and Rescue League, told KPBS . San Diego:  'It's great that the new mayor is being proactive and at . least . closing the seal rookery at night, when the seals are without any . protection, and the rope is not really visible.' 'This is important for public safety and for protection of the resting marine mammals during their pupping season.' There have been no arrests following the case in January. Marine mammals, including seals, . whales, dolphins, sea otters and other animals, are all protected under . the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), which makes it illegal to . harass, feed, hunt, capture, collect or kill any marine mammal or part . of a marine mammal, according to the Marine Mammal Center. According . to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, harbor seals . live in temperate coastal areas, including both the west and east coasts . of the United States. The mammals ‘haul out’ of the water to rest, . regulate their temperatures, interact with each other and to give birth. Mayor Filner used an emergency order to enforce the night time closure which was put in place from Tuesday.","Three men filmed harassing seals at the 'Children's Pool' in La Jolla .

"Russia today hinted that Vladimir Putin would grant political asylum to whistleblower Edward Snowden who leaked the American government's monitoring of phone records and the web. 'We will take action based on what actually happens. If we receive such a request, it will be considered,' said the Russian president's official spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Former CIA undercover operative Snowden's whereabouts are unknown since he checked out of a hotel in Hong Kong on Monday. Refuge: Russia today hinted that Vladimir Putin would grant political asylum to whistleblower Edward Snowden who leaked the American government's monitoring of phone records and the web . One Russian report stressed that the country has a consulate in Hong Kong where Snowden could make an asylum request. The Russian angle contrasts with its total refusal to act on Western hints that it could help solve the Syrian crisis by granting asylum to its long-time ally President Bashar al-Assad and his family. Snowden, 29, is a technology expert working for a private firm subcontracted to  the US National Security Agency. Refusal: The Russian angle contrasts with its total refusal to act on Western hints that it could help solve the Syrian crisis by granting asylum to President Bashar al-Assad . Last week he told the Guardian . newspaper of a mammoth surveillance operation run by the NSA on . telephone and Internet records around the world. In the US he has been branded a . traitor and there is pressure for his extradition from Hong Kong. However, he has triggered a debate in many countries on whether state . snooping goes too far. Russian MP Robert Schlegel urged the Kremlin to look at a the possibility of granting political asylum to Snowden. 'It would be a good idea,' he said. Putin is due to see US president Barack Obama at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland next week. Snowden has said he wants to seek asylum in Iceland. Iceland's interior minister, Hanna Birna Kristjánsdóttir, has the final say on whether the whistleblower would receive asylum in the country but a spokesman for her denied to The Guardian that the ministry had received any requests from Mr Snowden. 'At the moment we have received no inquiry or application from Mr Snowden, and we cannot therefore speculate on whether any such application would be granted,' Johannes Tomasson said. The country of 320,000 people has served as the home base for the fundraising efforts of anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks and earlier earned a reputation as a safe haven by taking in American fugitive former chess champion Bobby Fischer in 2005. Mr Snowden's case already echoes that of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange who took refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London last summer after Swedish authorities issued an international warrant for his arrest amid allegations of sexual assault. He has been hiding there ever since. Iceland's government of newly-elected conservative Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson, may not be so generous this time around. While still untested, it is widely seen as closer to Washington than past administrations and less keen to foster the island country's cyber-haven image. But Icelandic lawmaker Birgitta Jónsdóttir and International Modern Media Institute executive director Smari McCarthy released a statement on Sunday vowing to do all they could to help protect Mr Snowden, if he was able to make it to the shores of the tiny Nordic country. 'Whereas IMMI is based in Iceland, and has worked on protections of privacy, furtherance of government transparency, and the protection of whistleblowers, we feel it is our duty to offer to assist and advise Mr. Snowden to the greatest of our ability,' their statement reads, according to Forbes.com. Checked out: Today an employee at the 5* Mira Hotel in the neighborhood of Tsim Sha Tsui, said a guest by the name of Edward Snowden had checked out of the hotel this morning . Caution: Snowden also revealed that he covered his head with a blanket when he communicates to muffle his voice . Holed up: Speaking from his hotel room, Snowden admitted he had only left his room three times since he arrived on May 20 . The pair added that they were already . working on detailing the legal protocols required to apply for asylum . and said they were seeking a meeting with the newly appointed interior . minister Mrs Kristjánsdóttir as soon as possible to discuss whether an . application for asylum, if made, can be processed as a priority. In the Guardian interview, Mr Snowden suggested Iceland was his number one option. He said his 'predisposition is to . seek asylum in a country with shared values, The nation that most . encompasses this is Iceland. They stood up for people over internet . freedom.' McCarthy told The Guardian that they . have been following the story 'with morbid fascination' and Mr Snowden's . mention of Iceland was their 'cue to take action.' 'We are working on the basis that if he were to arrive in Iceland we would have a plan in place and ready to go,' he said. Mr Snowden needs to make his way to . Icelandic soil or show up at one of its embassies in order to claim . asylum. But if he managed that, he would have the Icelandic people's . support, McCarthy said. The government would have to weigh up . enraging its major trading partner in its decision to claim or reject . asylum to Mr Snowden. 'However, it would be rather . embarrassing for the States if it cut ties with this small nation . because it had complied with its human rights duties,' McCarthy said. He would be free to live in Iceland . while immigration authorities decide his case, which could take more . than a year, according to Helga Vala Helgadottir, a lawyer specializing . in asylum cases. Iceland has an extradition treaty . with the United States, but it is unclear whether it would cover any . crimes that Snowden might be charged with. Meanwhile, Ecuador is another . possible ally. The country's embassy in London is currently harboring . WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Edward . Snowden's whereabouts were not immediately known on Tuesday, although . he was believed to be staying somewhere in the Chinese autonomous region . that has a well-established, Western-style legal system inherited from . its status as a former British colony. Empty and on the market: Edward Snowden's former home in Waipahu, Hawaii, which he fled last month for Hong Kong so he could leak details about the U.S. government's secret surveillance programs . Secrets: A neighbour said today that the garage at the home had boxes stacked floor to ceiling when Snowden was planning his escape . Snowden checked out of Hong Kong's Mira Hotel on Monday and has not been seen in public in the territory. No charges have been brought and no warrant has been issued for the arrest of Snowden. He arrived in Hong Kong on May 20 and as a U.S. citizen is legally permitted to remain for 90 days. He . can also apply for asylum through the United Nations or attempt to fly . to another country which, unlike Hong Kong, does not have an extradition . agreement with the United States. Even . if an extradition request is brought by the U.S., Snowden could contest . it on grounds of political persecution in a process that could drag on . for years. In addition, . Hong Kong's high court in a ruling on a case concerning three African . asylum-seekers ordered authorities to devise a unified standard for . assessing asylum applications. The ruling effectively puts applications . on hold until the new system is in place. Jen . Psaki, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, refused to say . Monday whether the U.S. had made an extradition request or might do so . in the future. 'Necessary': The top intelligence official, James R Clapper, said the NSA's intelligence measures, carried out at sites like this one in Maryland, were 'used to keep Americans safe' Under the . terms of its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997, Hong Kong . maintained its independent legal system, a boisterous media, and strong . civil society that would likely object boisterously to any attempt to . railroad Snowden through the legal system. And though a semi-autonomous part of China, it ultimately answers to Beijing, which is often at odds with Washington. Greenwald . said he wasn't clear about exactly how Snowden made the decision to . come to Hong Kong, but said simply evading the U.S. authorities wasn't . the only factor he considered. 'It's very difficult for me to . assess that choice because it was a very personal mix of factors that he . took into account when deciding where he wanted to go, so if his only . goal had been how can I best evade arrest, there probably would have . been other better places for him to go,' said Greewald. Greenwald said The Guardian plans to publish further stories based on information provided by Snowden. Row: A security guard stands outside the US consulate in Hong Kong today, where inside officials will be trying to extradite Snowden back to the United States . The . U.S. and Hong Kong routinely cooperate on requests to transfer . criminals; in one high-profile case, Hong Kong extradited three al-Qaeda . suspects to the U.S. in 2003. The . U.S. is also one of the largest investors in Hong Kong, a major . business center for East Asia, and at least one local politician said . she thought it best if Snowden simply left. 'Maybe he doesn't know we signed so many treaties. The . two parties have agreed to all of them. So he'd better leave Hong . Kong,' said Regina Ip, a member of Hong Kong's legislative council and . former secretary for security, was quoted as telling the Takung Pao . newspaper. While Beijing at times stands up to Washington, it may not want to for Snowden. Beijing . has often criticized foreign governments for harboring critics of its . Communist government. China also is seeking U.S. cooperation on . retrieving corrupt Chinese officials who have fled to America, often . with sizeable assets. Cyberhacking . and cyberespionage have emerged as the newest friction in relations . that presidents Barack Obama and Xi Jinping pledged over the weekend to . improve. Still, the extradition agreement gives Hong Kong ways to say no. The U.S. and Hong Kong concluded . the treaty with Beijing's blessing on the eve of the territory's hand . back from Britain to China in 1997. Provisions allow one side to refuse a . request if it's deemed to be politically motivated or if the suspect is . unlikely to receive a fair trial. Beijing . may also have a veto. The agreement allows Beijing to refuse to . extradite a Chinese national for reasons of national security. A study by the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1997 suggests . Beijing may have wider discretion to prohibit any extradition, not just . of Chinese nationals, on national security grounds.","Edward Snowden, a former CIA technical assistant fled to Hong Kong .

"The woman whose shocked face amid the carnage of the Boston Marathon bombings became a symbol of the terror on Monday has been revealed as a triathlete whose sister lost a leg in the tragedy after they went to the race to cheer on their mother. Nicole Gross, 31, had her left leg broken in two places, suffered a fractured right ankle and a severed Achilles’ tendon.

'She remembers it all and just wishes that she didn’t,' her mother Carol Downing, 59, told the newspaper. She sits dazed and battered, missing one shoe, and surrounded by pools of blood and horrifically injured race watchers.

Yesterday it emerged that scientists testing the lasers on Nasa rover Curiosity have discovered rocks with startling similarities to a matter found on Earth. Researchers expected the substance to contain the same minerals as rocks found elsewhere on the Red Planet, but instead learned it was chemically more akin to an unusual type found on Earth. The make-up of the rock is similar to one found on oceanic islands like Hawaii and St. Helena, as well as in continental rift zones like the Rio Grande, which extends from Colorado to Chihuahua, Mexico. Target: This image shows where the Curiosity rover aimed two instruments to study a rock known as Jake Matijevic . Referring to rock formed from molten material, Curiosity scientist Ralf Gellert, from the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, said: 'It was a bit of a surprise, what we found with this rock. 'It's igneous. But it seems to be a new kind of rock type that we encountered on Mars.' Curiosity arrived on Mars two months ago to learn if the most Earth-like planet in the solar system was suitable for microbial life. Exploring another world: Pictures taken by Curiosity's camera shows fine sand taken from the surface of Mars . Nasa named the rock after the late . engineer Jacob Matijevic, who was the surface operations systems chief . engineer for Mars Science Laboratory and the project's Curiosity rover. He passed away on August 20, at age . 64 and was a leading engineer for all of the previous NASA Mars rovers: . Sojourner, Spirit and Opportunity . Last month, Curiosity's laser was used . to zap the football-sized rock and the rover analysed the pulverised . material, as well as tiny pits left behind, to determine its chemical . composition. Scientists . found the rock lacks magnesium and iron - elements found in igneous rock . examined by previous Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity. The rock, named after a Jet Propulsion . Laboratory rover engineer, Jake Matijevic, who died shortly after . Curiosity's landing, was also rich in feldspar-like minerals, which . provided clues about the rock's history. Geologist . Edward Stolper, from the California Institute of Technology in . Pasadena, compared the make-up of the rock to how hard apple cider was . partially frozen in big barrels during the winter in colonial times. He . said: 'The way in which this type of rock forms ... is like how . applejack liquor was made. You'd crystallise out ice and you'd make more . and more and more concentrated apple-flavored liquor.' Magma . inside a planet can undergo a similar process, he added, saying it . takes very particular conditions on Earth to produce this type of magma. Stolper . said: 'You melt the interior and it comes to the surface and, just like . the applejack, when you cool it, it crystallizes.' Meanwhile, . the rover has moved on to testing and cleaning of its soil scoop. Eventually, scientists want to funnel soil samples to Curiosity's . onboard laboratory for more extensive chemical analysis. The . rover is part way to its first science target, an area known as . Glenelg, which has three different types of rock intersecting. The . car-sized Curiosity rover landed inside a giant impact basin called .

"The Pope entered Scotland’s independence debate yesterday, saying he would be worried by a vote to split up the UK. Pope Francis said the break-up of countries such as the former Yugoslavia that had been forced together was justified because its people were so diverse. But asked about breakaway regions such as Scotland and Catalonia in states where people had long been united, he said the case for independence was ‘not so clear’. Pope Francis and the US President Barack Obama has both spoken out against Scottish independence, in a blow for Alex Salmond . In remarks that may resonate with . Scotland’s Catholics, he said: ‘All division  worries me. There will be . cases that are just, but the secession of a nation without a history of . enforced unity must be taken very carefully and analysed case by case.’ He is the latest high-profile figure to question Scottish independence ahead of the referendum in less than three months. Barack . Obama dealt a blow to the nationalist cause last week by urging . Scotland not to leave the UK, while Hillary Clinton, who is tipped to . replace him as US president in 2016, told BBC’s Newsnight on Thursday: . ‘I would hate to have you lose Scotland.’ Harry Potter author JK Rowling donated £1million to the Better Together campaign against independence this week.

"An unusually high number of dolphins have been found washed up on East Coast beaches this summer. From New Jersey to Virginia, more than 120 bottle-nosed dolphins have been found dead or dying on beaches since June. The bodies are sent to the University of Pennsylvania Veterinary School for necropsy, or animal autopsy, but so far the answer to what's causing the deaths has eluded experts. Mysterious: Virginia Aquarium Stranding Response Team members carry a deceased male dolphin on a metal stretcher from Ocean View Beach in Norfolk August 1, 2013 - their third dolphin retrieval of the day . High toll: Danielle Monaghan, Field Stranding Technician, examines a dolphin that washed ashore in Margate Thursday morning, at the Marine Mammal Stranding Center in Brigantine, New Jersey . The number of dolphins brought in for testing - an average of two a day - is hindering experts from getting closer to an answer, said  Bob Schoelkopf, founding director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center. 'Every year we have dolphin deaths,' Schoelkopf told Philly.com. 'We won't speculate on a cause until the lab results come back.' A similar large number of dolphin deaths in New Jersey occurred in 1987. In that case, the cause of death was due to morbillivirus, an illness similar to human measles. Since July 9, 21 dead dolphins have been discovered on beaches in Ocean, Cape May, Monmouth and Atlantic Counties in New Jersey. Migration: Dolphins washing up on the beach is a common sight during this time of year as they migrate, but not in the numbers we are seeing . In New Jersey, 21 dead dolphins have been found so far this year, compared to a yearly average of 12. In Delaware, 10 dolphins have died since June, compared to a typical seasonal toll of five. In Maryland, where there is usually one death each season, four dead dolphins have been discovered. What’s causing the deaths isn’t yet certain. The number of dolphins brought in for testing - an average of two per day - has delayed the center from getting closer to an answer, according to Schoelkopf. So far, necropsy reports for four dolphins in New Jersey show pneumonia as the cause of death, but Schoelkopf says more dolphins need to be tested to draw any conclusions. The Pennsylvania Veterinary School’s reports haven’t come back yet because they the testing center is shorthanded with so many dolphin corpses coming in for testing. Swimming against the tide: Marine Mammal Stranding Center co-director Bob Schoelkopf (pictured) says the team examining the dead dolphins is working around the clock . Epidemic: In July, nearly four dozen dead dolphins were found in Virginia, up from the typical six or seven usually picked up in July by the Virginia Aquarium Stranding Response Team (pictured) 'My guys are actually working their days off as well as their regular scheduled days,' Schoelkopf told CBS. 'Not only are we feeding and caring for the seals here and the sea turtle, but we have to go and run up and down the coast picking up these dead animals.' 'It's absolutely alarming,' Susan Barco, research coordinator at the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center Foundation, told Reuters. 'This is really frightening because these animals are sentinels of ocean health. Strandings have been much more common in the past few decades and we think it's an indication of the health of our ecosystem,' she said.","21 dead dolphins have washed up in New Jersey since June up from the usual 12 .

"Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic company ignored repeated safety warnings before Friday’s fatal explosion, it was claimed last night. One leading rocket expert said the entrepreneur’s ambitious space project had been playing ‘Russian roulette’ with the pilots’ lives because one of the test flights was sure to end in disaster. The company’s chief executive, George Whitesides, denied claims that one of the project’s own engineers had warned as recently as Thursday that the spacecraft was too dangerous to fly – but had been overruled by an executive who said the deadline was too pressing. Scroll down for video . Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) stand beside the debris of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo in the Mojave Desert after it exploded and crashed during a test flight over California . Sequence of events: These images show the Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo rocket separating from the carrier aircraft, left, prior to it disintegrating in the air, right, during a test flight on Friday . Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson rejected that there were specific warnings last week about the planned flight, and said the company takes safety issues very seriously. ""When you have any incidents you get a lot of self-proclaimed experts coming out, a lot of whom know nothing about what they talk about,"" Sir Richard told BBC TV. ""If any of our rocket engineers warned something wasn't safe to go we wouldn't go. I've spent 30 years running three airlines without incident,"" he said. ""We take safety very, very carefully. Nobody said anything to worry any of the team about going."" Yesterday US government investigators started combing through the five-mile long wreckage of Virgin's SpaceShipTwo in the Mojave desert in California. The Virgin Galactic spacecraft had been scheduled to begin passenger flights as early as next spring after eight years of delays caused by technical problems. But even Sir Richard has had to admit that its fate is now uncertain after the rocket blew up during a test flight, killing one pilot, Michael Alsbury, and seriously injuring another. Crash investigators say it may take a year to discover what caused the disaster. Crisis: Sir Richard Branson has had to admit the fate of his space tourism venture is now uncertain . The National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the probe into the crash, said investigators found that the spaceship's 'feathering' system - which lifts and rotates the tail to create drag - was activated before the craft reached the appropriate speed. The fuel tanks were found intact and had not blown up, they said. Aerospace experts are already speculating that, whatever the cause, the tragedy may permanently halt the race to take high-paying tourists into space. Virgin insisted there had been no cancellations from the hundreds of would-be passengers who are ready to pay as much as £150,000 for a 15-minute trip into sub-orbital weightlessness. But US lawyers said the nascent space tourism industry could now expect far greater scrutiny from aerospace regulators, particularly on the issue of passenger safety. With the US space agency Nasa having lost 3 per cent of astronauts in fatal accidents, sceptics wonder whether a commercial passenger company could ever operate on such a high level of risk. Questions about the cause of the crash are already focusing on the fuel propulsion system which was used to blast the rocket after it detached from its carrier plane. Virgin Galactic has been using a combination of liquid nitrous oxide and plastic fuel. But experts have warned for years about the instability of nitrous oxide, so-called laughing gas, which is also used by dentists. Carolynne Campbell, a UK-based rocket engineer and lead expert for the International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety (IAASS), said that if used in a rocket engine, nitrous oxide can ‘go bang in a very unpredictable way’. She said yesterday that her repeated warnings to various Virgin Galactic chiefs about the dangers of rocket propulsion were ignored. Although the Virgin Galactic website has been describing nitrous oxide as ‘benign’ and ‘stable’ as recently as six months ago, experts note that it contributed to the 2007 explosion at the company’s spaceport in which three engineers were killed. Miss Campbell said: ‘They knew that three people were killed by this stuff and yet they persisted in presenting it as safe, stable and benign.’ She said Sir Richard’s company should ‘give up’ and ‘go away and do something they might be good at like selling mobile phones – they should stay out of the space business’. She added: ‘This explosion is not a surprise. It was Russian roulette which flight blew up.’ Tommaso Sgobba, executive director of the IAASS and former safety chief at the European Space Agency, said: ‘I have been saying for some years now that this was an accident waiting to happen.’ Branon, right, with, from left, Burt Rutan, Mike Alsbury and Mark Forger: Mr Alsbury died in Friday's crash . Wreck: Virgin Galactic has been using a combination of liquid nitrous oxide and plastic fuel. But experts have warned for years about the instability of nitrous oxide, so-called laughing gas, which is also used by dentists . Geoff Daly, a British rocket scientist, said nitrous oxide was ‘very poorly understood in large quantities’. SpaceShipTwo was believed to have carried up to 12,000lb of it. Some critics have suggested that the space project has seen Sir Richard confusing his two public endeavours, one as a buccaneering adventurer who relishes personal risk and the other as a canny business entrepreneur who makes millions by undercutting rivals in fields such as mobile phones and air travel. Virgin Galactic chief executive Mr Whitesides has rejected accusations that the company had been taking too many risks. He said the criticism from experts amounted to a difference of professional opinion rather than valid warnings. He insists they had paid ‘a lot of attention to the several hundred engineers that we have on staff’ as well as other expert consultants they had consulted. Sir Richard has promised a full investigation into what went wrong and admitted his company ‘fell short’.","Virgin spacecraft used volatile mixture of nitrous oxide and plastic fuel .

"A Massachusetts couple had the best intentions when they rescued a baby seal over the weekend, but their act of kindness could result in a $5,000 fine. Weymouth residents Mark Hodgdon and fiancee Mary Johansson were scuba diving at a Marshfield beach when they came upon a baby seal covered in bite marks. They brought the seal ashore and called a volunteer from the New England Aquarium, who refused to touch the seal and promptly returned it to the ocean. Now, the couple may face a hefty fine for violating the Marine Mammals Protection Act. Sealed with a kiss: Mark Hodgdon appears to receive a kiss on the nose from the grateful pup . Rescued: The seal pup has wounds all along its side, possibly from an encounter with a shark . Hodgdon and Johansson were in the water at about 1:30pm when they encountered the little seal, which they say was having difficulty keeping its head above water to take a breath. 'As I got a little bit closer, he just swam closer to me and jumped right up on my shoulder,' Hodgdon told Fox 25. Hodgdon noted that the seal had bite marks all along the side of its body, which he believes came from a shark attack. 'You could just tell his whole body was in the shark. It had to have been,' he said. Distress: Hodgson says he was only trying to help the baby seal, which looked like it had been in a tussle with a shark . Disillusioned: Mary Johansson says she hasn't stopped thinking about the little seal pup she and her fiance rescued on the weekend that was released back into the sea by a marine volunteer . Johansson recorded Hodgdon lifting the two-foot seal onto a raft, at which point the seal pup appears to bestow a kiss on Hodgdon's nose. He brought the seal to shore and called marine officials, but when the volunteer arrived, Hodgdon claims they didn't want to help. The couple say the volunteer didn't seem to think the seal was in trouble, and asked them how the couple knew the seal was injured. 'He turned around and asked me, ""How do you know he's really hurt, did you take an X-ray?""' Mark told Fox 25. The couple was horrified when the volunteer released the seal back into the ocean. 'They're supposed to be there to help these little animals and they did nothing, nothing,' said Johansson. 'It breaks my heart.' Help wanted: The couple say the seal was in dire need of help and that he probably drowned after being released into the water after Hodgdon's rescue . Unresolved: The couple frequent this Marshfield beach but they're unlikely to ever see the little seal pup again . A spokesman for the New England Aquarium said, 'We try to not intervene with animals that don't require rescue. This particular seal pup is right on that line in terms of doing that, but the trained staff that we had sent down there made a decision that he didn't merit that intervention.' 'I think he probably drowned,' Johansson said. 'He's been on my mind every minute since Sunday.' Touching marine mammals, including seals, is a violation of the Federal Marine Mammal Protection Act, and now the couple could face a $5,000 fine. They are in good company, with members of the Kennedy family also facing the penalty for recently helping an endangered turtle in the waters off Nantucket. 'This is a wild creature, asking you to help it out,' Hodgdon told Fox 25. 'Why wouldn't you do it?' The New England Aquarium said that while the couple's intentions were good, the best course of action would have been to call the U.S. Coast Guard and stay near the creature in the water until help arrived.","Scuba diving couple came across a seal they say was injured and struggling to breathe .

"While humans have been using sonar since the 1940s, marine mammals have been hunting prey with it for tens of millions of years. Now a new fossil study suggests an ancient whale used sound beams to find food 28 million years ago. The new whale species, called Cotylocara macei, was found to have air pockets in its skull that had similarities to those used by modern day porpoises and dolphins to send out focused sound beams. The skull of the 28-million-year-old Cotylocara macei. Its anatomy and density variation indicate that this early toothed whale used echolocation to find its prey . The discovery places the evolution of the technique, called echolocation, to around 32 million years ago . That was relatively soon after whales, around 35 million years ago, split into two major cetacean groups - toothed whales that were active hunters and toothless baleen whales that were filter feeders, straining food like krill from the ocean. Jonathan Geisler, an anatomy professor at New York Institute of Technology who led the research published in the journal Nature, called echolocation 'an amazing trait.' 'It's a sonar-like system which allows them basically to navigate and find food, particularly in waters where there's little light, either at great depth or in very turbulent waters with a lot of mud, like estuaries or around marshes,' he added. An artistic reconstruction of the 28 million-year-old Cotylocara macei as it patrolled the shallows near present-day Charleston . Whales that use echolocation produce very high-frequency vocalisations through a soft-tissue nasal passage located between the blowhole and skull. Other mammals, including people, produce sounds using the voice box, or larynx, inside the neck. When . air is pushed through the whale's nasal passage, it produces extremely . high frequency clicks, squeaks and squeals that then echo off objects in . the water, enabling the whale to get a high-resolution audio image of . its surroundings. Cotylocara, whose fossilised remains include a 22-inch skull, neck vertebrae and ribs, was about 10 to 11 feet long and probably swam in a shallow ocean environment, feeding on fish and squid. The fossils were unearthed near Summerville, South Carolina, outside Charleston, said College of Charleston geology professor James Carew, another of the researchers. While Cotylocara looked superficially like some smaller modern-day toothed whales, it was not closely related to them. 'This is a member of an extinct family that split off very early from other echolocating whales, dolphins and porpoises,' Professor Geisler added. 'They went extinct 25 million or 26 million years ago and they don't have any living relatives.' Whales that use echolocation produce very high-frequency vocalisations through a soft-tissue nasal passage located between the blowhole and skull. Other mammals, including people, produce sounds using the voice box, or larynx, inside the neck. When air is pushed through the whale's nasal passage, it produces extremely high frequency clicks, squeaks and squeals that then echo off objects in the water, enabling the whale to get a high-resolution audio image of its surroundings. 'They can ""see"" the fish and then they know to swim in that direction to catch it,' Professir Geisler said. Nearly a decade ago, scientists unearthed a complete toothed whale skull, along with a few neck vertebrae and some ribs in a fossil-rich region near Charleston . The sound-producing mechanism is complex, with big muscles, air pockets and bodies of fat - all in a small facial area. The sound is too high frequency for human ears to hear. Modern-day whales that use echolocation possess a melon, or a fat-filled organ in the head, that focuses the sound wave. Professor Geisler said he suspects that Cotylocara already had this organ. The whale's genus name, Cotylocara, means 'cavity head' in recognition of a very deep pocket atop its skull thought to be associated with an air sinus used in echolocation. Whales are not the only animals that use echolocation. Bats, which also first appeared more than 50 million years ago, use it while flying to pinpoint insects and other prey. The first whales appeared more than 50 million years ago, arising from wolf-size land dwellers. Whales gradually became better suited to sea life and grew larger - one called Basilosaurus that lived about 40 million years ago was at least 56 feet long. Echolocation was a later adaptation. Toothed whales, dolphins, and porpoises produce their high-frequency vocalisations through a constricted area in the nasal passages below the blowhole .","28 million-year-old fossil was of a species of whale called Cotylocara macei .

"With the school holidays underway, the merest hint of sunshine could see millions of families flocking to the coast. But beachgoers should exercise caution, the hottest July in six years has a sting in its tail - an ‘explosion’ in jellyfish sightings. The tentacled creatures thrive in warmer waters, and global numbers having been rising steadily, with large fluthers- collective noun for jellyfish- now gathering around our shores. Worst affected parts of the country include beaches in Devon and Cornwall, and the north-west coast, according to the Marine Conservation Society (MCS). Scroll down for video . Beware: Swarms of jellyfish have arrived in our waters due to the recent heatwave and are gathering around our shores . Sightings include Lion’s Mane jellyfish, which possesses one of the most painful stings in British waters. The species, which can grow several feet wide and is the largest in the world, gets its name from the mass of vivid yellow-orange tentacles trailing down from its body. They have been spotted frequently between the north Wales and Blackpool coast. Experts warn people to ‘look but not touch’ if they should come across them on the beach, and stay out of the water altogether. Those unfortunate enough to be stung can be left with painful red welts and blisters, and can even trigger a heart attack. Holidaymakers are also being told to watch out for blue jellyfish, with numbers ‘absolutely exploding’ across south-west in recent weeks, as thousands float near the shore. It has a mild sting, not dissimilar to that of a nettle, but can trigger anaphylactic shock in those who are allergic. 'Look but don't touch': Swimmers and sunbathers are advised to keep their distance from jellyfish and to stay out of the water altogether . So far this year, only one deadly Portuguese Man of War has been sighted, in Cornwall. The MCS’s biodiversity programme manager Dr Peter Richardson said: ‘The scarcity of jellyfish reports before June was unusual and could well be linked to the exceptionally cold spring. ‘However, as our waters warmed, sightings of jellyfish increased drastically. Certainly on the north-west coast - Liverpool bay up to Blackpool - and the north coast of Wales, there have a raft of sightings Lion’s Mane jelly fish. For visitors to the British seaside, apart from the Portuguese Man of War, it is the one that has the most powerful sting. Rare: There has only been one sighting of the deadly Portuguese man-of-war jellyfish in Cornwall . ‘They can be quite nasty and are definitely ones to avoid, although we are not aware of any fatalities. But some people report it is like being struck by an electric shock, while others can go into anaphylactic shock. ‘There has also been plentiful reports of compass and blue jellyfish in the South West. Although their sting is mild, families should still be on the lookout.’ Dr Melanie Austen is Head of Science at Plymouth Marine Laboratory, said: ‘There is definitely greater awareness of jellyfish numbers and probably an increase in recent years, although it is hard to make a comparison without historical records. ‘We think the rise is a result of warming waters due to climate change, which means there is more food around for the jellyfish. ‘And overfishing may have also played a role, with a lack of larger fish that eat them and help keep numbers down.’ The MCS is urging people to report their sightings of jellyfish by filling a form on their website, as the species act as a barometer of the seas. The UK survey follows a mass invasion of thousands of miles of the Mediterranean coastline by millions of jellyfish in June, to the annoyance of sun-seeking tourists who have flown there this summer.","Worst affected parts of the country are beaches in Devon, Cornwall and north-west coast .

"House prices recorded their strongest monthly jump in three years in March as market conditions continue to blossom, property analyst Hometrack said today. The 0.3 per cent rise was driven by a boost to London house prices, with concerns over the crisis in Cyprus and the eurozone likely to send more cash flowing into the English capital in the coming months, the study said. The national increase in house prices this month marks the highest growth seen since March 2010. Prices soared by 0.7 per cent month-on-month in London, showing the strongest uplift since February 2010. Nationally house prices increased by 0.3 per cent - the biggest jump Britain has seen for three years . Three-fifths of London postcodes saw prices increase in March and London properties now spend just under five weeks on the market before they are snapped up - the shortest average time period seen since October 2007. London has enjoyed strong demand from wealthy overseas buyers who see the capital as a ‘safe haven’ from the troubles of the eurozone. Richard Donnell, director of research at Hometrack, said that the latest crisis in Cyprus ‘will only serve to further boost the flow of international funds into the capital’. Across the rest of England and Wales, prices rose in a fifth of postcodes - the highest share in three years. The report is the latest in a string of studies which have pointed to Government efforts to unblock the housing market having an impact. Lenders and estate agents have been reporting uplifts in activity, mortgage availability has increased sharply and loan rates have been slashed since the Government launched its Funding for Lending scheme (FLS). House prices are likely to be bolstered further by a multibillion-pound scheme called Help to Buy, which was announced in last week’s Budget and will help more people get on the property ladder or get up it with a five per cent deposit. However, the Government has been warned that the scheme must not create a ‘housing bubble’ and push up house prices to an extent which could eventually lead to a crisis. Three-fifths of London postcodes saw prices increase in March and London properties now spend just under five weeks on the market . The Hometrack study said that the North East was the only region across England and Wales to see house prices fall month-on-month, recording a 0.1 per cent slide. Prices were flat in the East Midlands and the North West. They increased by 0.1 per cent in the South West, Wales, the West Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside and rose by 0.2 per cent in East Anglia and the South East. Mr Donnell said that a lack of homes on the market has also been key to supporting house prices, at a time of year when demand traditionally rises. He said: ‘Looking ahead, the continuation of the FLS together with Budget initiatives aimed at supporting lending and demand for new housing, will only serve to support pricing levels. ‘The general improvement in market sentiment on the back of rising prices will be welcomed across the housing industry. ‘However, while scarcity of homes, support for lending and new housing will all act as a support to pricing levels, the problems of affordability and deposit levels still remain serious impediments to a full blown housing market recovery.’ The research regularly asks estate agents and surveyors about achievable selling prices.","Property prices in Britain rose by 0.3 per cent and by 0.7 per cent in London .

"A rare albino dolphin has been captured by Japanese fishermen and could be sold for up to £300,000 to be displayed in captivity. The fishermen killed 11 other dolphins in a shallow cove in Taiji, Wakayama, central Japan, according to members of the Sea Shepherd conservationist group. They then transferred the albino into a small holding pen where it is being trained to eat dead fish and adapt to human interaction. Scroll down for video . A rare albino dolphin has been captured by Japanese fishermen and could be sold for up to $500,000 to be displayed in captivity . Campaigners are trying to stop the controversial annual hunt of the dolphins in the town, as well as the sale of the mammals to aquariums. 'It is horribly sad to see another albino dolphin taken by the killers here in Taiji,' said Karen Hagen, a leader of campaign group 'Cove Guardians'. 'These rare, beautiful, and unique animals will spend the rest of their days confined to small tanks, where they will live out their shortened lives performing tricks for food,' she said. The controversial hunt takes place annually between September and March in Taiji, Japan. Most dolphins are killed for their meat, while some are sold live to aquariums around the world. Campaigners are trying to stop the controversial annual hunt of the dolphins in the town, as well as the sale of the mammals to aquariums . Most dolphins are killed for their meat, while some are sold live to aquariums around the world . It was the subject of Oscar-winning documentary The Cove which thrust the small town into the global spotlight in 2010. 'This brutal hunt is carnage carried out in the name of profit, not culture,' said Melissa Sehgal, a Sea Shepherd campaign coordinator. 'These dolphins do not belong to Japan; they belong to the ocean.' The group says that 15 pods of dolphins have been slaughtered in the cove since this year's hunting season began, with more than 170 dolphins killed. Over four days in mid-January, Taiji fishermen selected 52 dolphins for sale into captivity, slaughtered 41 for meat, and then drove the surviving pod members back out to sea, according to Sea Shepherd. Despite the use of tarps and other screening strategies, Sea Shepherd and some news organisations obtained photographs and video of the hunt, which helped fuel global response. Local people defend the hunt which is a long-held tradition, saying it is no different from slaughtering any other animal for meat.","Fishermen killed 11 other dolphins in a shallow cove in Taiji, central Japan .

"This is the moment a pod of killer whales lured dolphins into a bay and savagely attacked them as tourists looked on in horror. Ferry passengers were taking photos and videos of the elegant creatures skirting at pace over the waves in Canada's Nanaimo Departure Bay. Little did they know, this was the start of a rare and deadly fight for survival. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Race: The elegant creatures looked playful as they skirted across Nanaimo's Departure Bay on Monday . Attack: Tourists thought they were watching dolphins at play before the whales launched into a dramatic attack . Dozens of dolphins raced to safety with eight or nine orcas on their tail. The reality of the scene became clear as the Biggs whales - known for feeding on other mammals - isolated a group and surrounded them. For a moment, there was silence. Then blood-soaked water was splashed into the air metres away from families on the boat and on land, helpless to intervene. The whales leaped and dived, thrashed and biting. Finally, after minutes of relentless attacking, the whales ate two of the dolphins before darting off, leaving the others to flounder. Behind the pod of dolphins, these orcas are seen bobbing through the water silently at high speed .

Biggs killer whales are renowned for moving silently, except for when attacking their prey. They are notoriously dramatic predators, ramming themselves into the target to send it hurling into the air, or drowning it by repeatedly pushing it under water. Experts warn Monday's attack could become more common as both the dolphin and whale populations in the area increase.

Dr Lance Barrett-Lennard told the TV station the number of harbour seals, white-sided dolphins, and Biggs killer whales have soared in the last 20 years. But, he added, the attack is a necessary balancing of mammals in the area, which has not happened enough in recent times. He said: 'The fact that this area has recaptured some of its original dynamism in terms of marine mammals, that's a good thing.'","Nine Biggs whales - famed for eating mammals - chase dozens of dolphins .
