"If you've ever struggled to find a restroom or been appalled at the state of public facilities, a new app could come to the rescue. Called Airpnp, it allows people to rent out their restroom for between $3-$5 per visit. Owners wanting to list their facilities must post pictures, and even specify the type of toilet paper they have - with some offering a range to choose from. The app offer restrooms around the world, and is extremely popular in Europe . The app started life at the New Orleans Mardi Gras - but has now expanded globally. The founders said the site was inspired by their tribulations when . attending New Orleans's Mardi Gras festival and being unable to find a . bathroom. 'This problem is often solved by using what is known as a 'rogue pee',' they explain. 'If caught the person faces a weekend in Orleans Parish Prison. 'Yet this stiff penalty doesn’t stop thousands upon thousands of 'rogue pees' -  and this clearly demonstrates the demand for a legal alternative.' One New York listing offers the chance to pet a dog while using the facilities . The firm's advertising positions it as an alternative to festival toilets . Around 400 bathrooms have signed up for the service, from Korea to Colombia - and still has many in New Orleans. 'Clean bathroom in our uptown home,' reads one. 'Toilet paper and hand soap provided, of course. Large mirror for checking yourself out.' Another advert offers a 'porcelain paradise' just off the main parade route in New Orleans, for $3 per visit.The advert reads: 'Imagine, you, gazing at passing floats. Now imagine you gazing at more floats just a few minutes later. 'Because that's all it will take for you to unleash your bowels in our frequently cleaned porcelain paradise.' One user in Union Square in New York even offers to let visitors pet her dog while using the facilities - although one commenter claims the animal relieved itself on them. 'Small dog is in-house,' the ad reads. 'Visitors can play with her if they like while friend is in the stall.' Another ad in south Korea admits 'It's not spacious to dance, but enough to pee.' 'You can recharge your phone while you are peeing.'","System set up for Mardi Gras in New Orleans .

"After more than a month spent living without teeth, 16-year-old cancer survivor Alex Hunter finally has something to smile about. The Delano, California, teen had all his teeth removed in early July due to chemotherapy side effects. When the family's medical insurance refused to foot the bill to fit Alex with dentures, the Hunters took to the Internet, launching a fundraiser to collect the $11,000 needed to pay for the dental procedure. Say 'cheese'! Alex Hunter, 16, a cancer survivor from California, is showing off his new dentures, which his family were able to pay for thanks to a fundraising campaign . This morning, the boy's wish for a new set of teeth finally became a reality. Speaking . exclusively to MailOnline Friday evening, Alex's mother, Lizbeth . Hunter, revealed that her son was overjoyed to have his new dentures. ‘He . was a little more excited than he thought he would be,’ Ms Hunter told . MailOnline in a phone interview. ‘It was an emotional moment for all of . us, but definitely a good one.’ Alex’s . mother said the procedure took more than an hour since the teen, who . has beat two rare cancers, suffers from some issues with his jaw bone. When all the dental work was complete, Alex was thrilled at the results and proclaimed his dentures 'perfect.' ‘He just smiled really big. He just had nothing but joy,’ his mother said. It . will take a few more days for Alex to adjust to the new teeth before he . is able to talk and eat normally, but Lizbeth Hunter said her brave son . is taking everything in stride. Open wide: Alex is pictured Friday in the office of a Los Angeles dentist getting fitted with his new dentures . Happy customer: The 16-year-old is giving the thumbs up after seeing his new self in the mirror . Pearly whites: Alex's mother said her son proclaimed his new teeth 'perfect' She . revealed that for his first meal after the long-awaited dental . appointment the teen chose Wendy’s, but because he is not entirely . comfortable yet wearing the dentures, he was forced to take them out to . eat. Thank you to everyone: Alex pictured in July with a sign thanking all the Good Samaritans who donated money towards his expensive dental procedure . Lizbeth Hunter also said that the dentist who performed the procedure and his staff were very pleased with the results and marvelled at how naturally Alex’s dentures looked on him. ‘To me they don’t look natural because I’m not used to seeing him with teeth,’ Lizbeth said with a laugh. As for Alex, Mrs Hunter said, ‘He loves them.’ On the eve of the dental procedure, Alex told his friends at school that he was planning to go to Los Angeles to be fitted with a set of dentures – news that came as a shock to them. ‘They didn’t realize he had no teeth!’ Mrs Hunter told MailOnline. In an interview with MailOnline last month, Lizbeth Hunter said Alex was 'blown away' by the reaction from around the world as cash for his dentures poured in from those touched by his story published by MailOnline. In less than a day, the family raised the $11,000 for the procedure - and then some! Declined treatment by his insurance company, Alex took to his gofundme page to express his heartfelt gratitude, 'from friends, to family, to my community and everyone else that has been beyond generous to help me in meeting and surpassing my goal. Thank you!' In . less than 48 hours, Alex has seen donations of more than $17,000 flood . into his gofundme page to help him and his initial goal of $11,000 was reached in less than . 20 hours. Addressing the Good Samartinas’ largesse, Ms Hunter said her son was surprised and ‘very very grateful.’ ‘He had no idea so many people would actually care,’ she said Friday after the dental appointment. Fighter: Alex Hunter, 16, has had all of his teeth removed after battling cancer twice -and his insurance company declined to cover his dentures because it is not a medical issue . Strong bond: Alex, far left, pictured with his family after his dental appointment . One anonymous donor pledged $5,000 and Lizbeth said that she was extremely touched by the gesture. 'I am praying God blesses you as much as you have blessed Alex,' said Lizbeth to MailOnline in July. The remaining money left over from the fundraising campaign will remain in an account to help Alex with any more medical expenses he will need. Lizbeth Hunter said her son still suffers from side effects related to one of his ailments. Later this year, the high school junior will undergo a scan to make sure his thyroid cancer has not made a comeback. Alex, from Delano, California, made the tough decision to get his 19 remaining teeth in July after years of radiation left the roots fragile and the teeth too loose to use. While his insurance - which is provided by the state because of his mother's job working for Bakersfield - covered part of the procedure to remove the teeth, it refused to cover the dentures, his family said - prompting their internet fundraising. 'They say it's not a medical issue but they know they took out the teeth because of a medical issue,' his grandmother, Roberta Hunter, told MailOnline earlier this summer about the insurance company's stance. 'It feels like the insurance is just bailing out on him.' Now the teenager, who loves to sing and one day hopes to be a high school counselor, will be able to eat and speak normally - and finally smile. 'Even when he smiled, he didn’t show any teeth,' his mother recalled. On the mend: Alex was first diganosed with cancer when he was four and overcame it, before being diagnosed again when he was 13. His family is now hopeful that he is cancer-free for the second time . Alex's family, who have never asked for anything throughout Alex's 11 years of treatments launched their gofundme page, Alex Hunter's Medical Fund, last month in the hope of raising the money. Inspiration: Despite his health struggles, Alex is a top student who dreams of becoming a counselor . Alex was just four when he was first diagnosed with a rare type of cancer, Embryonal Parameningeal Rhabdomyosarcoma, after a mass started growing in his cheek. He underwent aggressive chemotherapy and stayed in hospital for months as he battled the side effects of the radiation. He lost vision in his left eye and feeling on the left side of his face. He was also left with a thin frame, loose teeth and thyroid gland issues, but in July 2003, doctors said he was cancer-free. Then in November 2011, when he was 13, he was back to hospital to undergo surgery on an enlarged thyroid gland - and doctors learned he had Hurthle Cell Carcinoma, a rare thyroid cancer. On the gofundme page, his family explained that the cancer is believed to be an effect of treatment from his first battle with cancer. But now, nearly three years on from his second diagnosis, and his family said he is free from cancer again. One final scan in October will confirm that he's been cured. In the meantime, Alex is impressing his family with his commitment as a student and a friend. Relatives told KERO that he once put together a yearbook for a friend, including photos and signatures from staff and students, after the teen could not afford to buy one from the school. Alex is also taking advanced placement classes and has been singing with the choir for two years. He is already thinking about college, where he wants to major in psychology and sociology. 'He's just so positive,' his grandmother said. 'He sings, he's really active in school - but kids do stare at him. I can't wait for him to get his teeth but right now all we can do is take it one day at a time.'","Alex Hunter, 16, smiled for the first time Friday morning after being fitted with a new set of teeth .

"Excessive? A new report claims that Osama bin Laden was shot more than a hundred times by Navy SEALs in the 2011 raid . Special operations sources have claimed that the terror leader was shot more than one hundred times in the fatal 2011 raid. A new report from a website known within the intelligence and armed services community claims that the sheer number of times that Osama bin Laden was shot is the reason why the government has never released photos of his dead body. Citing two confidential sources, The Special Operations Forces Situation Report tells how 'operator after operator took turns dumping magazines-worth of ammunition into Bin Laden’s body'. The site goes on to argue that while the Navy SEALs may have felt it was 'morally, legally, and ethically appropriate to shoot the body a few times to ensure that he is really dead and no longer a threat,' that does not justify the extent of this damage. 'What happened on the Bin Laden raid is beyond excessive.  The level of excess shown was not about making sure that Bin Laden was no longer a threat.  The excess was pure self-indulgence,' author Jack Murphy writes. At the time of the assassination, President Obama and his administration argued that they were justified in never releasing the photos of the dead body or the burial at sea because they could be used as propaganda for al Qaeda. The new theories, however, suggest that they are just trying to avoid retribution for allegedly being excessive. Scroll down for video . Hollywood interpretation: Zero Dark Thirty imagined the events leading to Bin Laden's capture . Mission: The Al Qaeda leader was killed at this . compound in Abbottabad by U.S. Special Forces and new reports suggest that the excessive force that was used may be why his death photos have not been released . Photos that have been released: Images of bin Laden, like these which are being used as evidence in the ongoing trial against his son-in-law, have prompted debate among military veterans and good government groups . Details about the classified mission were unearthed in SEAL Team Six member Mark Bissonnette's book which differ from the SOFREP account, but Murphy writes that Bissonnette's version 'is perhaps the most measured and polite description that one could give'. In his book, Bissonnette does not put a firm number on the amount of bullets used but it sounds far less excessive than the latest reports. 'In his death throes, he was still twitching and convulsing. Another assaulter and I trained our lasers on his chest and fired several rounds,' Bissonnette wrote in No Easy Day which was published in September 2012. 'The bullets tore into him, slamming his body into the floor until he was motionless.' Incorrect depiction: The latest information suggests the raid of the Bin Laden compound went down very differently to the events since fictionalized in Hollywood in films like Zero Dark Thirty, pictured . His version: Mark Bissonnette, who was a member of SEAL Team Six who was at the raid described them using far fewer bullets to kill the elderly terror leader . Tension: The raid of bin Laden's Abottabad . compound was watched by President Obama and his closest advisers in the . Situation Room of the White House . Murphy argues that the number of bullets used is less of a issue pertaining specifically to this particular case but grows problematic if it represents a changing attitude within the Navy SEALs. 'Gone unchecked, these actions get worse over time,' the Army Special Operations veteran writes. 'The real issue is not that Bin Laden was turned into Swiss cheese, but rather that this type of behavior has become a Standard Operating Procedure in this unit.'","Special Ops sources have claimed that the Navy SEAL team unloaded multiple magazines full of ammunition into the dead terror leader's corpse .
Some think the alleged excessive treatment is the reason why the Obama administration has not released the 'death photos' of the al Qaeda leader .

"Lydon said that he is not an enemy of Baroness Thatcher now that she is dead . Former Sex Pistol John Lydon says those now celebrating Margaret Thatcher's death are 'loathsome'. Lydon, famously known as Johnny Rotten when he was the singer in Punk icons The Sex Pistols back in the 1970s as Maggie was rising to power, added: 'I'm not going to dance on her grave.' He said: 'I was her enemy in her life but I will not be her enemy in her death.' He also denied being a mysogynist and a Nazi following a controversial appearance this week on Aussie TV show, The Project. During the interview he told presenter Carrie Bickmore: 'Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Now listen, when a man is talking do not interrupt.' He also gave a wave during the interview, which has been misinterpreted by some in the Aussie media as a Nazi salute. John spoke about Baroness Thatcher's death when he arrived at Sydney's domestic airport on Wednesday from Brisbane ahead of his band Public Image Limited's performance in the city that night. The Sex Pistols (from left) Steve Jones, Sid Vicious, Johnny Rotten (John Lydon) and Paul Cook, rose to fame as the former prime minister rose in power . The 57-year-old said: 'I'm not happy about the boo boo parties. 'When . someone dies, give them respect. Enemy or not. I can't be listening to . folk who do that. 'What kind of politics are they offering me? You dance . on another person's grave? That's loathsome.' The singer said he would not be dancing on Margaret Thatcher's grave . But as to whether he would be watching an TV coverage of Baroness Thatcher's funeral, he said: 'I might have something better to do.' He added: 'Her politics were really dreadful and derisive and caused a great many issues for me when I was young, for all of us trying to go through that. 'But that don't mean I am gonna dance on her grave, as they say. I'm not that kind of person. 'I was her enemy in her life but I will not be her enemy in her death. I am not a coward.' He added: 'My entire life, socially, was all around the Maggie era. 'That was the great challenge as a Sex Pistol was how to deal with Margaret Thatcher. 'I think we did rather good.' He also denied she was having a Diana-style funeral. 'She's not. It's a Conservative send off. Do you think they'll be parading me through the streets of London? 'I'm more likely to be dragged along from the back of a wagon.'","John Lydon says he will not be former prime minister's 'enemy in death'

"A Saudi cleric has sparked outrage by declaring that baby girls must wear the burka. Sheikh Abdullah Daoud, who said all female newborns should wear the veil, insisted the burkas would help to protect the infants against the threat of sexual attacks. His comments, made in an interview with an Islamic television station that has surfaced online, have been widely condemned as 'disturbing' and harmful to the religion. Shocking: Saudi cleric Sheikh Abdullah Daoud has provoked outrage by suggesting that babies should wear burkas to protect them against the threat of sexual attacks . In the interview broadcast on al-Majd TV last year, Sheikh Daoud cited instances of babies being sexually molested in Saudi Arabia, and quoted unnamed medical and security sources, a report on Al Arabiya News said. After the footage suddenly spread across the internet this week, commentators called for the cleric to be held accountable for his unregulated fatwa, which they said was damaging to Islam. Islamic law holds that women should wear the veil after they reach puberty. Sheikh Mohammed al-Jzlana, a former . judge at the Saudi Board of Grievances, told the news channel that . Sheikh Daoud's remarks had made the faith look bad. He . urged people to ignore unofficial religious edicts, which he said were . administered under special regulations set by Saudi authorities, which . also appoints those entitled to issue them.

Most of the victims appear to have been killed by gunshost wounds to the head. In . one image the bodies of five women are seen slumped together on the . floor of bathroom. In another the bodies of eight women are seen lying . in a pool of blood in what appears to be a living room. MailOnline has decided not to publish these images. A message scrawled on a wall inside one of the apartments read: 'This is the fate of any prostitution.' While . no group has yet claimed responsibility for the murders, locals believe . the killings were carried out by Shiite militants opposed to . prostitution. The gunmen, who are believed to be Shia militants, reportedly burst into two of these apartments murdering everbody inside . Police arrived at the building to find blood streaming down the stairs.

A . police officer speaking on condition of anonymity said: 'When we walked . up the stairs, we saw a couple of women's bodies and blood streaming . down the stairs. 'We . entered a flat and found bodies everywhere, some lying on the sofa, . some on the ground, and one woman who apparently had tried to hide in a . cupboard in the kitchen shot to death there.'

Shiite . militias have become more active on the streets of Baghdad since Sunni . militants led by jihadist fighters took over large swathes of eastern . and northern Iraq a month ago. Gunmen in Baghdad have executed at least 29 people including 20 women in an apparent raid on a brothel . While nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack, it is thought Shiite militants are behind it . Sunni ISIS fighters have seized most of the country's north, including all of its borders with Syria, in an attempt to set up a single Islamic state across country lines.

Violence is at its highest level in Iraq in recent years according to the UN, with 2,417 people killed in June, the majority of them civilians, the highest number since 2007. The latest attacks in Baghdad mirror executions carried out by Shiite militias in May 2013 in the same district, when gunmen attacked brothels and alcohol shops. Seven women and five men were killed on that occasion after gunmen burst into a brothel, while 12 shopkeepers died after militants restrained a nearby police officer before shooting them.

"In what could be considered the ultimate in wearable technology, a biohacker has inserted a computer under his skin. The biometric sensor is fitted into German-based Tim Cannon’s forearm - between his skin and tissue - and tracks changes in his body’s temperature. This sensor can connect wirelessly to any Android device, produce readouts of the temperature changes and send Cannon a text message if he’s suffering from a fever, for example. Scroll down for video . German-based biohacker Tim Cannon fitted the biometric sensor, pictured, under the skin on his forearm. It connects by Bluetooth to an Android tablet. The sensor tracks changes in his body's temperature. If the temperature reaches a certain level, a text message is sent warning him of a fever . To insert the device, an incision was made on Cannon's forearm above an existing tattoo.

Circadia is protected inside a protective case and has a battery that can be charged wirelessly. Cannon created the sensor, called Circadia 1.0, using a Bluetooth connector, computer chip, and fitted it with LED lights. These LEDs act as ‘status lights’ that can be used to light up a tattoo on Cannon’s arm, under which the sensor is fitted. The first version of the sensor reads temperature changes but, in theory, later versions could be used to track other vital signs and body changes. Circadia is protected inside a protective case and has a battery that can be charged wirelessly. ‘The human body is really failing in almost every way,’ Cannon told Motherboard, VICE’s science and technology channel. ‘I want to live to be thousands of years old, I don't want to die and I don't know why anybody would. ‘[The idea behind the sensor] is very fun.

"Dead but not gone: Government officials were quick to distance the project from the city's most famous former resident, insisting it is simply a drive to boost tourism to the region .

"Detained and cuffed: Charles Belk sits on the street with his legs crossed while two officers guard him after his arrest for a crime he did not commit on Friday . A film and television producer preparing to attend an Emmy's pre-party on Friday says he was wrongly held for six hours by officers of the Beverly Hills police force who said he 'fit the description' of a black bank robber. Harvard graduate Charles Belk, 51, posted a photograph to Facebook of himself handcuffed and sitting on a curb with two officers standing over him after he was pulled over as he left a restaurant to top up a parking meter. The award-winning executive says he was swarmed on Wilshire Boulevard by officers and not told why he had been arrested and was denied a phone call before being released just before midnight when police admitted they had made a mistake. A furious Belk was booked on $100,000 bail and says he was treated with contempt by the arresting officers who only let him go when they reviewed the video and realized that the bank robbery suspect bore no resemblance to him according to KTLA. The photograph of Belk sitting indignantly on the curb, legs crossed while officers of the Beverly Hills Police Department stand guard over him has been shared almost 30,000 times on the social network. Belk, who has worked with the NAACP to produce their Image Awards and on An Evening of Stars tributes to music legends Chaka Khan and Lionel Richie, took to Facebook to express his deep disappointment and concern over his arrest. Scroll down for video . Television: Charles Belk with actor and producer Catfish Jean (left) and actor Hari Williams (center). The Harvard educated producer was arrested and booked on a $100,000 bond on Friday . 'I get that the Beverly Hills Police Department didn’t know that I was a well educated American citizen that had received a B.S. in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California, an MBA from Indiana University … and an executive leadership certificate from Harvard Business School,' wrote Belk on Facebook. 'Hey, I was ‘tall,’ ‘bald,’ a ‘male’ and ‘black,’ so I fit the description.' Describing the distressing moment he was pulled over, Belk said 'It's one of those things that you heard about, but never think it would happen to you.' Belk, who was the Deputy Director of Olympic Village Operations for the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games was pulled over at around 5.20pm. 'Within minutes, I was surrounded by 6 police cars, handcuffed very tightly, fully searched for weapons, and placed back on the curb,' wrote the angry television producer. 'Within an hour, I was transported to the Beverly Hills Police Headquarters, photographed, finger printed and put under a $100,000 bail and accused of armed bank robbery and accessory to robbery of a Citibank.' The arrest of Belk is just the latest controversial and unfortunate incident in recent weeks that has occurred between police and African American men, including the choke-hold death of Eric Garner in New York City and the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Emmys: Charles Belk poses with an Emmy award last week. The producer was working at pre-Emmy parties last week when he was arrested . Worryingly, Belk said that his arrest could have turned out drastically different and alluded to the current climate of tension that exists between law enforcement and African Americans. 'The sad thing is, prior to my freedom being taken from me for an easily proven crime I did not commit, I was walking back to my car, by myself, because I needed to check my parking meter, so that I wouldn’t get a ticket and break the law,' wrote Belk. 'In fact, if it wasn’t for a text message that I was responding to, I would have actually been running up LaCienega Blvd when the first Beverly Hills Police Officer approached me. Running!' After Belk's release, the Beverly Hills Police Department attempted to clarify their treatment of Belk, who should have attended a pre-Emmy's party instead of a freezing cold jail cell on Friday evening. A statement issued on Monday claimed that officers were investigating an armed robbery at a nearby Citibank and arrested Belk beause 'he matched the physical characteristics of the second suspect and was in the area of the bank shortly after the robbery.' A witness to the robbery allegedly identified Belk as the thieves accomplice, leading to his detention. Arrest: Chalres Belk posted his detention certificate to Facebook in the aftermath of his false arrest for a bank robbery in Beverly Hills on Friday . Thanking . his lawyer for eventually securing his release, Belk thanked them saying . 'I am certain that I would still be locked up in the custody of the . Beverly Hills Police Department. 'Based . on comments made by a Beverly Hills Police Officer during my booking, . and an FBI Special Agent, it appeared that they had tried and convicted . me.' Belk said he understood officers doing their job. However, what galled him was the fact that no one had checked the video. 'Why, . at 11:59pm (approximately 6 hours later), was the video footage . reviewed only after my request to the Lead Detective for the Beverly . Hills Police Department and an FBI Agent to do so, and, after being . directly accused by another FBI Special Agent of '…going in and out of . the bank several times complaining about the ATM Machine to cause a . distraction…' thereby aiding in the armed robbery attempt of a bank that . I never heard of, or ever been to; and within 10 minutes……10 MINUTES . (sic), my lawyer was told that I was being release because it was clear . that it was not me,' wrote Belk. The Beverly Hills Police Department said that they have apologized to Belk. 'The . Beverly Hills Police Department regrets the inconvenience to Mr. Belk, . but was under obligation to thoroughly verify that he was not the . suspect before releasing him,' the statement from the police read. However, . referring to the continuing troubles nationwide, Belk said that the . 'time has come for a change in the way OUR (sic) law enforcement . officers 'serve and protect' us.","Harvard graduate Charles Belk, 51, pulled over on curb in Beverly Hills on Friday .

"A group of Neanderthals killed and ate their fellow ancient humans, including young children, scientists have found. Using modern forensics techniques, including DNA analysis, the researchers found that 12 Neanderthals, all from the same family, had been eaten by their peers. In research presented to the Royal Society in London, biologist Carles Lalueza-Fox, said that the bones of the victims had been cracked open to extract the marrow, while the skulls were opened so brains and tongues could be eaten. Butchered: Scientists have found that a family of Neanderthals were killed and eaten by their fellow ancient humans (file picture) Remains, discovered at the El Sidrón cave system, near Asturias, in north western Spain, included the bones of three female and three male adults, three teenage boys and three children aged between two and nine-years-old. 'All had been butchered,' Mr Lalueza-Fox told the Royal Society on Thursday, according to the Sunday Times. 'It must have been a big feast. We think Neanderthal groups were . about 10-12 strong so this may have been a complete family group, . although someone may have got away.' Discovery: The Neanderthal remains were discovered accidentally at El Sidron in northern Spain in 1994 . Researchers had considered whether the cannibalised neanderthals had been killed by modern humans, although this was ruled out when dating techniques revealed that the remains pre-dated homo-sapiens in Spain by thousands of years. By analysing the stone tools used by the killers the scientists found that they had probably come from a few miles away, leading them to conclude that the culprits were probably neanderthals from a neighbouring group. Revealed: Scientists used the most recent scientific advances, including DNA sequencing, to find out details such as the hair colour of the Neanderthals. Pictured is a model of a Neanderthal man . 'I would guess they were killed in . winter when food was short. There is no evidence of any fire so they . were eaten raw immediately and every bit of meat was consumed. They even . cut around the mandibles of the jaw to extract the tongues,' said Mr . Lalueza-Fox. He said that as Neanderthals lived in smaller groups this may have made them liable to eat each other when no other food sources could be found, rather than modern humans who lived in larger groups and worked together in tougher times. The remains were accidentally discovered by cave explorers in 1994, with systematic excavations starting in 2000. In total 13 individuals have been retrieved in a painstaking operation designed to prevent contamination of the remains with modern human DNA. Due to the cold temperatures in the cave, which is 60ft underground, and its remote location, the neanderthals DNA was preserved for centuries, and had not come into contact with the DNA of other neanderthals, animals, or humans.  . The bones were found mixed up with gravel and mud in a small cave gallery, some 700ft from the entrance. Mr Lalueza-Fox, of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona, said he believed the victims had been slaughtered in a rock shelter situated above where the remains were found, their flesh stripped from the bones, which were then dumped. He said that a powerful storm had then washed the bones, stone tools and sediments down a gap in the rock and into the cave where they were eventually discovered. Mr Lalueza-Fox was able to use the most recent scientific advances, including DNA sequencing, to see reconstruct the Neanderthals' genes, leading to information being uncovered about their hair colour and blood group.","Scientists used modern forensic techniques to analyse ancient remains .

"Gay couples exchanged vows in early morning ceremonies in several New Jersey communities on Monday as the state began recognizing their marriages, becoming the 14th state to do so. Last week the New Jersey Supreme Court refused Governor Chris Christie's request that same-sex marriages be put on hold until a state appeal against the decision is decided. The Christie administration said on Friday it would appeal the decision but today he ordered his team to drop the appeal. In a statement on Monday, the administration said that Christie strongly disagrees with the Court for overruling 'the constitutional process of the elected branches or a vote of the people'. Scroll down for video .

But it added that 'the Governor will . do his constitutional duty and ensure his Administration enforces the . law as dictated by the New Jersey Supreme Court'. Mayors . in New Jersey cities including Newark and Jersey City opened their city . halls at 12:01am Monday morning, the official start-date of the court . order, to marry eager couples. The hastily planned first weddings to . legally unite long-time couples were planned for a state Senator's grand . home in Elizabeth, the boardwalk in Asbury Park and government . buildings in small towns and big cities. In . the arts community of Lambertville, Mayor David DelVecchio led the . ceremony to marry Beth Asaro and Joanne Schailey. He also presided when . they joined in a civil union the minute they became recognized in the . state in February 2007. Soon after they cut the cake, DelVecchio handed Asaro a pink marriage license. The couple, both wearing suits, hosted a reception attended by friends, family and several politicians. The song 'In the Mood' played. Backing down: The state's highest court had unanimously denied Governor Chris Christie's request to put gay marriage on hold while the state's appeal was heard. On Monday he dropped the appeal . Asaro, a member of the city council . in Lambertville, said they wanted to get married at the first moment, in . part, to promote the gay-friendliness of their community north of . Trenton. 'This shows to the world that Lambertville is open for business,' DelVecchio said. The . weddings came amid a flurry of legal activity after the U.S. Supreme . Court ruled in June that the federal government should recognize gay . marriages and confer couples with the same benefits that it does for . heterosexual married couples, including joint tax filings, the right to . live together in government-funded nursing homes and Social Security . survivor benefits. A . state judge last month agreed with advocates who said that by allowing . civil unions but not marriage, New Jersey was keeping gay couples in the . state from legal equality. The . administration of Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican and possible 2016 . presidential candidate, had appealed both the ruling and Monday's . implementation date to the state Supreme Court.

And on Friday, less than 60 hours before the weddings were to begin, the state's top court refused to delay them while it sorts out the overall case. The court said the state is not likely to prevail. Many of the people who have long fought for the right for gay couples to marry had been bracing for a delay, even while they were optimistic the state's top court would ultimately force New Jersey to recognize same-sex marriage. Despite the many happy unions that have been made in the wee hours of Monday morning, many couples have to wait for 72 hours after obtaining their marriage licenses according to New Jersey law, unless they can find a judge to waive the waiting period. Others have been held up by authorities unsure whether they had permission to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

Some towns began taking applications for same-sex marriage licenses on Thursday and continued even after the state government told them not to until there was clarity from the courts.

"In May 2009 euphoria swept through Spain as FC Barcelona won the UEFA Champions League. Following this event, reports predicted the win would spark a baby boom in Spain and now scientists have confirmed that the number of births in February 2010 did indeed rise, by 16 per cent. There was also an 11 per cent increase seen in births in March 2010, which the scientists claim may have still been a knock-on effect of the win. Spanish researchers analysed birth data at maternity centres in Catalonia from before and after FC Barcelona won the title in May, 2009. It found a 16% increase in February 2010, nine months after the event, compared to births in February in previous and later years (marked by grey squares) Initial reports in Spain claimed the birth rate following the Champions League win had spiked by 45 per cent, which has now been disproved. Following, the 1965 blackout in the northeast United States, the New York Times published four consecutive articles reporting a 30 per cent increase in the birth rates of five hospitals in Manhattan. However, in 1970, research found that there had actually been a 20 to 25 per cent decline in births rather than an increase. Following World War II, reports claim that between 1946 and 1964 the number of annual births exceeded two per 100 women - which worked at approximately 2 per cent of the global population at that time. The children born during this time have been dubbed 'The Iniesta Generation', named after Andres Iniesta who scored the winning goal. The initial 45 per cent claims were considered to be so high, scientists at the Althaia clinical center in the Catalan region of Bages wanted to confirm this. The researchers began by analysing birth data between 2007 and 2012 at two maternity centres  in Manresa, capital of Bages. As well as being home to the clinic, Bages was also the birthplace of Josep Guardiola who was the Barcelona manager at the time of the Champions League win. The researchers found that births in this Catalan region rose by 16 per cent in February 2010 and 11 per cent in March, compared to previous and later years. However, other sporting wins did not generate such a boom. The researchers actually saw a drop . in birth rate towards the end of 2010, despite the fact Barcelona also . won the Supercopa de Espana in August 2009 and Spain won the World Cup in December . 2009. The children born during this time have been dubbed The Iniesta Generation, named after Barcelona player Andres Iniesta, pictured, who scored the winning goal against Chelsea. Initial reports in Spain claimed the birth rate following this win had spiked by 45 per cent, which has now been disproved . This may have been caused by the economic crisis in the country at the same time, claim the authors. ‘In summary, our results may have several different interpretations,’ said the researchers in their paper 'Barcelona baby boom: does sporting success affect birth rate?' ‘One is that human emotions on a large scale can profoundly affect demographic swings in populations, that national or regional events can reduce the weight of reason and increase the weight of passion. ‘Validation of our results could contribute to a better understanding of human behaviour, improve healthcare planning, and even aid government policy makers in stimulating or reducing birth rates. ‘Ideally, to bridge the gap between observational and trial data, it would help greatly if Iniesta were willing to replicate his intervention—although the cost of such a study could be prohibitive, not to mention harmful to the reference group (Chelsea).’ Aside from the baby boom in February, comparative birth rates declined in the second half of 2012. This was despite the fact Spain also won the World Cup in December 2009. The researchers claimed this may have been due to the economic crisis in the country .","In May 2009, FC Barcelona won the UEFA Champions League .

"Prominent Tory MP Zac Goldsmith last night threatened to quit ‘immediately’ if the party softens its opposition to expansion at Heathrow Airport. David Cameron is set to order an independent commission into the future of Britain’s airports in a bid to end Tory infighting over the issue and secure a wider political consensus. Downing Street yesterday indicated that it would include ‘all the options’ for expanding airport capacity in the South East, including a new runway at Heathrow. Runway row: Zac Goldsmith,  left, a former adviser to David Cameron, has threatened to quit the Tory party over plans to build a third runway at Heathrow . A spokesman insisted the Government would stick to its pledge not to build a third runway at Heathrow during this Parliament. But some ministers, including Chancellor George Osborne, are pressing for the pledge to be dropped at the 2015 election. Mr Goldsmith, a former adviser on the environment to David Cameron, said he would quit immediately if this happens, triggering a by-election in his Richmond Park constituency in London, which lies under the Heathrow flight path. ‘I promised before the election that if the Conservatives perform a U-turn on Heathrow, I would trigger an immediate by-election so that local voters can have their say,’ he said. ‘Clearly, I would honour that commitment.’ Full up: Heathrow airport has less space to expand than rival European hubs . No way: The runway plans have sparked protest by environmentalists . Transport Secretary Justine Greening has also said it would be ‘difficult’ for her to continue in Cabinet if the party went back on its pledge on Heathrow. Number 10 yesterday confirmed that BAA, Heathrow’s operator, will be allowed to press its case for a third runway in the forthcoming review, prompting speculation about an impending U-turn. Mr Goldsmith warned any ‘ambiguity’ about the party’s intentions would wreck its hope in a huge swathe of constituencies near Heathrow. ‘I think if we enter the next election with a manifesto which does not rule out expansion of Heathrow I think the Conservative Party will be very badly defeated in areas beneath the flight path,’ he said.",MP's Richmond Park constituency lies under flight path .

"Orphans who lost their parents when a garment factory complex collapsed in Bangladesh vented their grief and anger at leading Western retailers today on the six-month anniversary of the disaster. Relatives of the 1,135 people who lost their lives when the Rana Plaza complex collapsed on April 24 also said they had still to receive any compensation for their loss as they rallied at the site of the tragedy. 'We lost our parents for your work: Walmart, Carrefour, Benetton ...,' read a banner held by a group of orphans, listing some of the retailers whose clothing was made at Rana Plaza before it collapsed. Grieving: Bangladeshi garment workers and orphans of those killed in the Dhaka factory collapse hold banners and pictures of the victims during a protest on the six-month anniversary of the disaster . Furious: A wheelchair-bound factory worker who was injured in the collapse demands compensation . Anger: Relatives of the 1,135 people who lost their lives when the Rana Plaza complex collapsed on April 24 also said they had still to receive any compensation for their loss . Delays: Although some retailers have promised to pay into a compensation fund, activists complained that money was not reaching those in need . Although some retailers have promised to pay into a compensation fund, activists complained that money was not reaching those in need. 'If you talk about legal compensation, none of the 3,629 workers working in the Rana Plaza at the time of the disaster has been paid a single cent,' said Roy Ramesh, Bangladesh head of the IndustriALL global union, which is negotiating with retailers for compensation. 'The government donated some money from its charity fund and British retailer Primark paid 30,000 taka ($375) to each of the victims,' he said, adding factory owners and the rest of the 28 retailers who were making clothing at the Rana Plaza factories have paid nothing. Rezaul Karim, 32, was one of the injured workers who joined the protest in front of the Rana Plaza ruins, demanding more money to treat his broken spinal cord and a monthly pension to maintain a decent life. Distraught: Relatives of Bangladeshi garment workers killed in the Rana Plaza garment factory building collapse react while gathering for the demonstration in Savar on the outskirts of Dhaka . Tragedy: A child stands with his father, a worker who survived the collapse. A charity found that nearly two-thirds of survivors and families of those who died had not received any legal benefits from their employers . 'Since the collapse, I've got only the . 30,000 taka ($375) given by Primark. I am now reduced to begging,' he . said, clutching the hand of his eight-year-old son. 'The government has paid for some of my treatment but more treatment is needed and it'll cost a huge amount. 'My . son cannot go to school and there are days we don't have enough food,' he said, adding he now depends on charity from relatives and neighbours. A . report by British charity ActionAid published on the anniversary also . highlighted a failure by the authorities and the retailers to compensate . the Rana Plaza victims and their families. The . charity surveyed 2,297 people - nearly two thirds of survivors and . families of those who died - and found that 94 per cent reported they . have not received any legal benefits from their employers since April, . including sick pay or compensation. Half measures: The Bangladesh government has paid some funds to 777 people - around a third of the victims and their family members - but no long-term compensation package has been agreed, a charity said . Struggling to cope: Primark, which is owned by Associated British Foods, has offered to pay long-term compensation to the victims of the disaster or their families . The Bangladesh government has paid some funds to 777 people - around a third of the victims and their family members - but no long-term compensation package has been agreed, it said. Primark, which is owned by Associated British Foods, has offered to pay long-term compensation to the victims of the disaster or their families. Some 550 workers at the New Wave Bottoms supplier, which was making clothes for Primark, will a be given a third payment, believed to be three months wages, while the long-term compensation is finalised. The minimum wage in the country is £24 a month and Primark said this offer would 'alleviate immediate hardship'. As part of the longer term deal workers will get medical and vulnerability assessments by experts at Dhaka University, independent doctors, unions and non-governmental organisations. Disaster zone: Some 1,129 workers were killed and about 2,500 injured six months ago when the blaze tore through the Rana Plaza building in Dhaka in April . Calls for change: Campaigners have been pressing the Bangladeshi government to increase the minimum wage and improve working conditions in the country's garment industry in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster . Primark will begin paying compensation early next year. 'The company calls on other brands sourcing from Rana Plaza to now contribute a fair share of this tranche of aid,' a spokesman said. Last month, IndustriALL called a meeting of some of the world's largest retailers in Geneva to discuss a £47.2m compensation fund for the workers injured in the disaster and the families of those who died. Only nine brands using clothes from the factory turned up. Primark, which is headquartered in Dublin and trades under the Penneys banner in Ireland, had a supplier on the eighth floor of the building. It was one of 28 brands being supplied from the factory. Other companies are said to be considering whether to follow the proposal. Primark said it was pressing ahead with its compensation scheme because of the time it is taking to reach agreement. It also committed to paying another three months wages to all workers or their families if the other 27 brands which used the Rana Plaza refuse to support their compensation scheme. Primark also sent food aid to 1,300 families within a week of the building collapse.

"Nidal Hasan collected nearly $300,000 of his military salary while awaiting trial for the 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas, but his victims will not see any of it. Hasan's attorney said nearly all of the money has been given to charity — likely making it impossible for his victims to get any of it. But civil attorney, John Galligan, wouldn't disclose any information about the charities or proof that donations had been made. Seeking compensation: Alonzo Lunsford describes one of his wounds from the 2009 Fort Hood shooting rampage, at his home in Lillington, N.C. He is suing the government . An Army spokesman said the military can't get back the money because Hasan, like any other service member charged with a crime, continued to receive his military salary until he was convicted last month. 'The great bulk of his income has been donated to charity,' said Galligan, who also once represented Hasan in the criminal case. 'There's really virtually no money in any bank that I'm aware of. There's really no property holdings.' The money would likely only be a fraction of what Hasan's victims and their relatives still need. Some have struggled to find jobs or pay medical bills since Hasan killed 13 people and wounded more than 30 others when he opened fire inside a crowded building on the Texas military base on Nov. 5, 2009. Payments: Nidal Hasan (pictured) collected nearly $300,000 in his military salary while awaiting trial for the 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas . But his salary carries symbolic value. 'It's not about the amount. It's about principle,' said retired Staff Sgt. Alonzo Lunsford, who was shot seven times by Hasan and testified at his trial. 'During this time the man was incarcerated, he was still drawing full military pay, full military benefits. That money was spent on him, and we were denied — still — certain benefits.' Lunsford wants Hasan's salary to go into a scholarship fund for victims' children. He also is among the victims suing the government, in a lawsuit that also names Hasan, in an effort to get the shooting characterized as a terrorist attack rather than workplace violence. The designation would make them eligible for more benefits and recognition that they say they deserve. Victim: Retired U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Shawn Manning still carries two bullets in his body from the attack . But whether they can get any money from Hasan is unlikely, according to the military, Galligan and a lawyer for the victims. Along with a lack of bank accounts tied to Hasan, FBI agents found little more than a table, a folding chair and a prayer mat in his apartment after the shooting. Given his rank as major, Hasan collected more than $7,000 a month in salary, according to the Army. That salary was subject to federal taxes, but Texas doesn't collect a state income tax. His paychecks were revoked 14 days after he was sentenced to death last month, per Army regulations. But his case had dragged out for nearly four years, in part because he was forbidden to plead guilty to charges after prosecutors refused to take the death penalty off the table. Hasan's expenses after the attack were limited, according to Galligan. Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates (right) speaks with police Sgt. Kimberly Munley at a hospital in Fort Hood, Texas, after the attack in November, 2009, left her wounded . About $10,000 was spent to hire a medical specialist to assess Hasan's life expectancy. Hasan was paralyzed from the waist down after being shot in the back by a Fort Hood police officer during the rampage. Hasan represented himself at his trial, and although he told the judge the shootings were necessary to protect Islamic and Taliban leaders from U.S. troops overseas, he presented no evidence or witnesses. The American-born Muslim had government-funded defense lawyers to help him, and Galligan said he has worked for Hasan mostly for free. Wounded soldiers arrive for the start of the memorial service that President Obama and Michelle Obama attended for the thirteen victims of the shooting rampage in November 2010 . Army spokesman Lt. Col. S. Justin Platt said the military can't get back the money Hasan was paid while behind bars. Hasan's sentence included a dismissal from the Army and a forfeiture of all pay and allowances. Galligan said Hasan's paychecks were not deposited in a bank, but he declined to say how Hasan handled them. He refused to hint at the type of charities Hasan allegedly helped. Reed Rubinstein, an attorney helping victims sue the government, said he was exploring ways to get any money or assets he could out of Hasan. But he acknowledged that those efforts might not succeed. 'We have no way of knowing what he did with that money,' Rubinstein said. 'It's quite possible and likely that the money is long gone.'","Victim Alonzo Lunsford wants Hasan's salary to go into a scholarship fund for victims' children - but it's been given to charity instead .

"Ram Singh Chauhan, 58, is the proud owner of the world's longest moustache - at an astonishing 14 feet long. Chauhan, who hails from the city of Jaipur in Rajasthan state, India, says his whiskers are his 'most prized possession'. He has spent an incredible 32 years cultivating the tash - which he spends two hours a day grooming. Scroll down for video . Record breaker: Ram Singh Chauhan displays his moustache at his house in Jaipur, India . He boasts the world's longest moustache - measuring over 14ft. It requires an extensive beauty regime to maintain its lustre . Chauhan, whose facial fur has even landed him a part in the James Bond movie 'Octopussy', said: 'Growing a moustache is like taking care of a baby - you really need to nurture it. 'It has taken me a long, long time to get it to 14 feet. It's not been an easy task.' Chauhan started growing his moustache during his late teens. 'I haven't used a shaving blade on my moustache, or trimmed them since 1970,' he said. 'The moustache is the symbol of pride and respect. In ancient India, a moustache meant everything. 'It is priceless. It's a man thing.' Ram Singh Chauhan with his wife Asha. She has spoken of her pride at his magnificent moustache . It begins: The couple pictured during their marriage in Jaipur. She admits she has asked him to shave it off in the past . Chauhan, whose feat has been recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records, is still cultivating his tash, but its growth has slowed drastically in recent years. But despite a number of contenders to his title, no others have come close to the mark. He said: 'When I first started to grow my moustache, I did not intend to break any record. Moustaches have been a part of Rajasthani and Indian culture for centuries. This is an age-old tradition. 'We are Rajputs. It's a common practice to sport a moustache in our clan. My father also sported a flowing one. Now my son has also started growing his.' However, Chauhan's moustache has seen him travel the world showing it off - including trips to Italy and Germany. Celebrity: His locks have seen him become a celebrity in his home town, making trips out difficult for the 58-year-old . Closer to home, he was the brand ambassador for the Rajasthan tourism department for over 30 years. A major part of his job was to show off his flowing moustache at tourist destinations. Chauhan said: 'Whenever I go out to the market or anywhere else, I become the centre of attention. People look at me in complete awe. They ask me all sorts of questions.' A few years ago, Chauhan was also invited to the famed German Beard and Moustache Club. 'They gave me lot of respect. They loved my moustache. Many said they had never seen something like this before,' boasts Chauhan. Maintenance: He has to massage his moustache using coconut, olive or almond oil every day . 'I have even done a show on the India-Pakistan border. It was like reuniting both sides.' Chauhan has also been cast in Hollywood movies and half a dozen Bollywood films. He says taking care of his long flowing moustache is a tedious task, spending hours each week grooming his beloved whiskers. He said: 'Once I get up in the morning, the first thing I do is to massage my moustache using coconut, olive or almond oil. 'I do not use a shampoo or soap, just herbals. Then, I comb them and neatly roll them up. This is the daily routine. 'Once a week, I do other treatments too. But all of them are natural methods. I never use commercial products.' The moustache has been recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records . Chauhan's wife, Asha, is happy that her husband has hogged the limelight all this time. Their children, two daughters and a son, are also proud of their father. Asha said: 'When we got married, he had a small moustache. But then he started growing it longer and longer. But it is nice - I have grown fond of it. 'The whole family is happy. He has done us so proud. I had never imagined that he would grow such a long moustache. The family is recognised only by this. 'We used to have fights, and I often told him to shave his moustache off. But those were just outbursts. I never meant it.' Ram Singh has spent 32 years cultivating the whiskers. Now his son (not pictured) is also cultivating his own moustache . Spiritual: Ram Singh Chauhan seen performing yoga in the morning . Chauhan says he wishes the younger generations would carry on India's historic love affair with the moustache. He said: 'This is the time of the clean-shaven youngsters, everywhere you look young people are without moustaches. 'It is nice to grow a moustache. It is the symbol of manhood. I would want to see every youngster grow a moustache.' He also adds that he wants an Indian to break his record. 'Records are meant to be broken. If at all my record for longest moustache is broken, I would want and an Indian to break it,' he remarks.","Ram Singh Chauhan has record-breaking 14ft moustache .

"A little girl with Down's syndrome has learnt to walk, talk and even dance - all through copying her big sister. Two-year-old Ellie Harrington, from Ely, Cambridgeshire, has started walking early in order to keep up with four-year-old sister Evie. Their parents, Lisa Moden, 42 and Mark Harrington, 43, say it's the desire to be like her sister that has helped Ellie to develop so quickly. Ellie Harrington, 2, has learnt to walk, talk and even dance through copying her four-year-old sister Evie . The pair play together 24/7 and love dressing up as princesses, their mother said. 'Evie's relationship with Ellie is very special, very close' It is known that children with Down's syndrome are visual learners, so being able to copy Evie has helped Ellie's development . Ms Moden said: 'I believe the main reason Ellie began walking early was because she desperately wanted to keep up with Evie. 'Ellie's muscle tone was very good, so she had a good head start with being able to follow her sister. 'Children with Down's syndrome are visual learners, so its great for Ellie to have a 24/7 playmate. 'The girls are inseparable, if Evie put on a princess dress on from her fancy dress box then Ellie will copy. 'They just love playing with each other, they are a little double act. 'Evie told me that when she grows up she wants to live with Ellie forever. It melted my heart.' Children with Down's syndrome   usually learn and progress more slowly than most other children, although the level of learning disability will be different for each child. It is known that children with Down's syndrome are visual learners, and so copying a sibling can help their development. Ms Moden says she couldn't be happier with the progress Ellie is making at such a young age. She said: 'Evie is constantly talking to her little sister so it's no surprise that at just two-years-old she's already pronouncing certain words. Their mother, Lisa Moden, said: 'I believe the main reason Ellie began walking early was because she desperately wanted to keep up with Evie . Their mother added: 'Evie adores her little sister and it's a relief to see them both learning new things together' Down's syndrome is a genetic condition that causes some level of learning disability and a characteristic range of physical features. Most babies with Down's syndrome are diagnosed shortly after birth and are likely to have reduced muscle tone, eyes that slant upwards, a low birth weight, a small nose and mouth and short fingers. They also have some degree of learning disability but this varies widely between children. Some children with Down's syndrome also have associated health problems such as heart disorders, digestive problems, hearing and visual impairments, thyroid dysfunction and blood disorders. It is one of the most common genetic causes of learning disability and around 750 babies are born with the condition each year in the UK. It is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 in the baby's cells. Currently, no one knows what causes the presence of the extra chromosome but Down's syndrome is more common in children born to older mothers. For example, if a woman has a baby when she is 25 there is a one in 1,250 chance of her baby having Down's syndrome, but if a 45-year-old woman has a baby, there is a one in 30 chance of it having Down's syndrome. Source: NHS Choices . 'Children with Down's syndrome generally experience some intellectual and physical delays but so far Ellie has been developing really well. 'Evie adores her little sister and it's such a relief to see them both learning new things together. 'If Evie starts dancing then her little sister will join in too, it's so funny to watch them together. 'They do get themselves into mischief though, I often find them both on the table or windowsills.' She was first told that Ellie could have Down's Syndrome when she was pregnant, after a blood test came back abnormal. She said: 'I was devastated with there being a one in five chance of her having the condition, but 80 per cent chance everything would be OK, so we just hoped for the best. 'I gave birth to Ellie at home and I knew as soon as I looked at her that she had it. 'I was horrified, I didn't know what to do, I couldn't see past her Down's syndrome. 'It makes me feel awful thinking back to all of those raw emotions but I was completely shocked.' Two weeks after being born, Ellie was officially diagnosed. But instead of dwelling on the condition, Ms Moden's family rallied round to support her through it. Lisa said: 'It didn't take long for me to see past the diagnosis, Ellie's didn't seem to have poor muscle tone, she was lucky with very good health and went from strength to strength. 'Evie loved her little sister from the moment she saw her, she was no different in her eyes. 'It's refreshing to see and it's nice to think she'll always have a friend looking out for her when she starts school.' As they girls have grown older, they spend more and more time together. Ms Moden said: 'The girls love playing together 24/7. Their parents say  Ellie learned to walk early because she wanted to keep up with her big sister . 'If they aren't climbing up our furniture they are playing hide and seek. 'Both of them love dressing up as princesses too, they have a lovely fancy dress box which they're always playing in. 'We've only told Evie that her sister is 'special' the same as any sibling, but that she need may need extra help learning things but with the pace Ellie picks things up she's barely behind.' Ellie now goes to nursery two days a week where she enjoys playing with new friends. Ms Moden said: 'I was so terrified when I realised Ellie has Down's Syndrome but she is amazing. 'I wouldn't change her for the world, I'm so proud of both my girls.' The family have been supported by Small Steps - a support group for children with Down's syndrome. Alison Watson, Founder of the group, said: 'When my Freya, now six, was born with Down's syndrome, I set up Small Steps as I felt it was important to have a support network for parents such as myself. 'Lisa bought Ellie and Evie to Small Steps to learn sign language, play, explore and have fun among people who understand and can support any worries or concerns having a child with Down's Syndrome can bring. 'Evie's relationship with Ellie is very special, very close. 'Ellie learns so much from Evie and children with Down syndrome are generally very visual learners. 'We want people to know that having DS is certainly not the end of the world. 'It's all about taking Small Steps, and enjoying every one of them.'

"Nasa has revealed a huge new gully on the Martian surface - and says it formed in just three years. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter snapped the area in 2010 and 2013 - and today revealed the before and after images that show the gully appearing. They say it was probably formed by carbon-dioxide frost. Drag the slider bar below to see the before and after pictures . Since its arrival in orbit in 2006, MRO . and its High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) telescope . have been mapping the martian surface. It completed its primary science phase in 2008 and continues investigations of Mars' surface, subsurface and atmosphere. The orbiter sports a dish antenna 10 feet in diameter and uses it to pour data Earthward at up to 6 megabits per second. It has a number of instruments including three cameras - one of which is HiRise, a spectrometer for identifying minerals, a ground-penetrating radar and an atmosphere sounder. Gully or ravine landforms are common on Mars, particularly in the southern highlands,' Nasa said. 'This pair of images shows that material flowing down from an alcove at the head of a gully broke out of an older route and eroded a new channel.' The dates of the images are more than a full Martian year apart, so the observations did not pin down the Martian season of the activity at this site. Before-and-after HiRISE pairs of similar activity at other sites demonstrate that this type of activity generally occurs in winter, at temperatures so cold that carbon dioxide, rather than water, is likely to play the key role, the team believe. The area is home to several large gullies and channels . MRO has observed other Martian features that do seem associated with liquid water — dark streaks known as recurring slope lineae, for instance. Since its arrival in orbit in 2006, MRO . and its High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) telescope . have been mapping the martian surface. The . HiRISE team released preliminary, black-and-white images in March of . that year, and have since collected hundreds more.

"The inventor of the World Wide Web has spoken in support of whistleblower Edward Snowden and said he should be protected. Sir Tim Berners-Lee said that the former US intelligence contractor and others like him play an essential role in exposing abuses of power, and should not be punished. The computer scientist also claimed that checks and balances in the US and around the world had failed, and that even with reforms, the system was unlikely to get better. Scroll down for video . Sir Tim Berners-Lee has spoken in support of whistleblower Edward Snowden . Sir Tim made his comments to the BBC after Channel Four broadcast Mr Snowden's alternative Christmas message yesterday. The internet founder said: 'When checks and balances break down, all society can rely on are the whistleblowers.' He added: 'And because they have been performing this important function of saving society when it is in its most desperate state, therefore we need, I think, to have a form of international recognition for whistleblowers.' Recorded in Russia, Edward Snowden delivered Channel 4's 'Alternative Christmas Message' this Christmas . And Sir Tim added that whistleblowers would be particularly important in the future saying that some leaks 'really help and not hurt humanity.' He said: 'I don't think an automatic Nobel prize is necessarily part of that, but some way of generating an amnesty.' He added: 'We must assume that those systems in the future will break down too.' In his Christmas message Mr Snowden, who revealed details of electronic . surveillance by American and British spy services, warned of the dangers . posed by a loss of privacy. Video Source Channel 4 . Christmas message: Edward Snowden speaks during an interview in Hong Kong . In a . two-minute video recorded in Moscow, where Snowden has been granted . temporary asylum, he spoke of concerns over surveillance in an age of . huge technological advancement. 'We . have sensors in our pockets that track us everywhere we go. Think about . what this means for the privacy of the average person,' he said. 'A child born today . will grow up with no conception of privacy at all,' said Snowden. 'They'll never know what it means to have a private moment to . themselves, an unrecorded, unanalysed thought. And that's a problem . because privacy matters, privacy is what allows us to determine who we . are and who we want to be.' The . 'Alternative Christmas Message', broadcast annually on . Channel 4 television since 1993, mimics the format of the yearly address . to the nation by Queen Elizabeth. Previous . participants have included then President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . in 2008 and popular cartoon characters Marge and Lisa Simpson in 2004. Snowden warned of dangers to democracy in the first video released of the fugitive since arriving in Russia . On . Tuesday, Snowden - who disclosed thousands of confidential documents - . said in an interview published in the Washington Post that he had . achieved what he set out to do. 'For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission's already accomplished,' he said. Snowden left his NSA post in Hawaii in May and went public with his first revelations from Hong Kong a few weeks later. In . June, he left for Russia and stayed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport . for nearly six weeks until the Kremlin granted him temporary one-year . asylum. The United States has revoked his passport and demanded he be sent home to face charges for stealing secrets. President Barak Obama: Last week a White House-appointed panel proposed curbs on NSA surveillance . Earlier . this month there were signs of thawing attitudes when Richard Ledgett - . a top NSA official who leads a taskforce at the agency responding to . the leaks - left open the option for Snowden to return to the United . States in an amnesty. 'It's worth having a conversation about,' he told CBS. 'I would need assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured and my bar for those assurances would be very high,' Ledgett said. Senior officials in the Obama administration remain opposed to such a move. Last week a White House-appointed panel proposed curbs on some key NSA surveillance operations, recommending limits on a programme to collect records of billions of telephone calls, and new tests before Washington spies on foreign leaders. 'The conversation occurring today will determine the amount of trust we can place both in the technology that surrounds us and the government that regulates it,' Snowden said in the Christmas address. 'Together we can find a better balance, end mass surveillance and remind the government that if it really wants to know how we feel, asking is always cheaper than spying.' The former director of the CIA has spoken out over calls to grant clemency to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Robert James Woolsey weighed into the argument saying that the former contractor, who is currently hiding in Moscow, should be 'hanged by the neck until dead.' Former CIA director Robert James Woolsey has said that Edward Snowden should be 'hanged by the neck until dead' It is thought that Mr Woolsey's comments reflect the current thinking in Washington. However, last week a White House-appointed committee recommended key reforms which would curb NSA surveillance operations. But disclosing the classified information, Mr Snowden committed crimes, but many feel that he should be allowed to return to the US.","Sir Tim Berners-Lee said that whistleblowers are essential for society .

"The policeman who shot dead a black teenager in St Louis has revealed he is under 24-hour guard and 'can't go out' at this 'stressful time' in his first comments since the killing. Darren Wilson text messaged a close friend to say that he can't leave protective custody because he would be immediately recognized - making him and his young child a target. In his messages Wilson, 28, also thanked for the support of his friends which he said was 'really keeping me going'. He had texted Jake Shepard, his friend of 14 years, who showed the messages to MailOnline because he wanted the public to get a more accurate picture of the friend he described as always having 'pure intentions'. Scroll down for video . Aftermath: A friend of officer Darren Wilson, above, told MailOnline that Wilson was in hiding with his young child because the 'whole nation' is behind Michael Brown's family and Darren 'doesn't get that' support . Aftermath: A friend of officer Darren Wilson, above, told MailOnline that 'it sucks' that his and that of the unarmed black teenager he shot, Michael Brown, 'are now over' Friday, August 15 . (After Shepard does CNN interview) Wilson: 'Thanks buddy I wasn’t expecting that . Shepard: 'No problem buddy, you deserve it' Wilson: 'It means a lot thank you' .... Monday, August 18: . Wilson: 'The support is really keeping me going during this stressful time. Just stay safe. I appreciate all you have done' Later... Wilson: 'I can't go out' Shepard, 28, said he felt that there were two sides to this story and that he wanted to re-balance the coverage of the death of Michael Brown, 18. Brown's killing has sparked nine nights of riots and protest in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. Shepard told MailOnline he thinks Wilson did the right thing according to his training. But he believes that the police in general should have better training to use non-lethal force before opening fire. He said: 'It's sad for Mike Brown and his family. Darren could have just Tasered him and Mike would have spent six months in jail or something and maybe got his act together after that. 'Darren could have gone on with his life too but now both of their lives are over. It sucks. 'I'm sure Mike's family is having a hard time but at least they have the support of the whole nation behind them, openly. Darren doesn't get that'. Shepard's comments came as people have begun to come out in support of Wilson, who lives in a quiet middle class suburb of St Louis in a ranch style house. A rally took place on Sunday in downtown St Louis where around 100 people - many of them cops - held up posters in support and cheered as drivers honked their horns. Two Facebook pages have been set up to back him with a total of 35,000 likes. The first text that Wilson sent to Shepard was on Friday after he spoke to CNN in a brief interview. It read: 'Thanks buddy I wasn't expecting that'. Shepard replied: 'No problem buddy, you deserve it.' Wilson replied: 'It means a lot thank you.' Support: Shepard provided MailOnline with this photograph of him playing hockey, which he did with Wilson, said Wilson 'doesn't deserve' to be remembered negatively for life as a killer cop . The two then texted over the weekend and Darren explained that he cannot go out in public and that anyone wanting to reach him should leave their messages with the Ferguson police department. On Monday Wilson texted: 'The support is really keeping me going during this stressful time. Just stay safe. I appreciate all you have done'. In another message he told Shepard that due to all the attention: 'I can’t go out'. Shepard told MailOnline: 'People are very suspicious of law enforcement as it is and something like this happens you will always be remembered as the cop who murdered Mike Brown, regardless of what happens at trial or if he's ever charged or fired. 'Obviously he's not going to be able to be a cop over there (in Ferguson) any more. 'He’s going to have to resign but there's always going to be a negative connotation to his name, and it sucks. He doesn't deserve that. 'He's had pure intentions with everything I've ever seen him try and do. When we played hockey he wasn't the guy out there trying to fight people, he didn't care about stuff like that. 'He just wanted to play and have fun with his friends'. Asked if he knew where Wilson is now, Shepard said: 'I know he’s safe because I have a friend in law enforcement who said he has been put under protection and guard 24 hours a day.' 'I feel like he's still around (St Louis)'. Needless: Shepard, who believes police should be trained better to use non-lethal force, said: 'It's sad for Mike Brown and his family. Darren could have just Tasered him and Mike would have spent six months in jail or something and maybe got his act together after that' Shepard said that he first met Wilson in 2000 when they were in the same year at St Charles West High School and that they played hockey together. After that Wilson attended Saint Charles Community College between 2004 and 2005 where he studied criminology and criminal justice, the institution’s president Dr Ron Chesbrough told MailOnline. Wilson went back to the same college in 2011 and completed a criminology course - by then he was a policeman. Describing his friend, Shepard said: 'He’s pretty shy, we had hockey practice three or four nights a week so you get to know people. 'He's the type of guy who never had anything bad to say about anyone. Through all of this people are always asking me questions about what he's like and I realized that when you're talking to him he's never talking about himself, he's always asking about you and what's going on with you. 'He’s happy to be around his friends, he goes with the flow, he's laid back….he's just a normal guy'. After Wilson was named as the officer involved in the shooting, Shepard was one of the first to come to his defense and wrote on Facebook that he 'has the biggest heart'. Shepard said that Wilson 'had a rough life' because his mother died when he was 16 and his biological father lives in another state, meaning that he never really had parents for much of his youth. Troubled: Shepard said that Wilson's mother died when he was 16 and his biological father lives out of state - but added that Wilson (pictured in his 2002 yearbook) never liked to talk about his hardships . Whenever he asked Wilson about it he did not like to talk about the past, Shepard said. Another of Wilson's friends spoke out earlier in the week. A woman calling herself 'Josie' called radio program The Dana Show last Friday to say he had told her Brown had 'bum-rushed' him prior to the shooting. ‘Josie', who would only give her first name but said she was friends with the cop's girlfriend, had her account corroborated by a source who said it matched what Wilson told investigators, CNN reported on Monday. According to the St Louis Post-Dispatch more than a dozen witnesses have backed up Officer Wilson's report of what happened on August 9. Meanwhile, Wilson’s father, John Wilson, 60, - who lives in Texas - has been nervously watching the Ferguson furor play out on national TV news and talk shows. 'It goes without saying that I love my son very much,' Mr Wilson told MailOnline as he stood on the wooden deck outside his single-story prefab home on a remote country lane, east of Houston. Mr Wilson said that he has spoken to his son since the shooting but he was reluctant to reveal what father and son spoke about or how Darren is handling the tense situation he is in. 'The police have chosen not to make any comment about my son, other than to release his name,' added Mr Wilson. 'And Darren himself has not made a statement. So until they do come out and say something, I am not going to talk about it either.'","Jake Shepard, a friend of 14 years, showed MailOnline texts from Wilson .

"A bizarre green flurry of lights off the coast of Bangkok left an astronaut baffled after he took a picture of it this week. Astronaut Reid Wiseman posted the image yesterday tweeting: 'Bangkok is a bright city. The green lights outside the city? No idea.' The Baltimore native, who is on board the International Space Station, took the image from more than 200 miles (320km) above the planet and the green glow was clearly visible. A green flurry of lights off the coast of Bangkok left an astronaut baffled after he took a picture of it this week . Theories ranged from aliens to nuclear waste and bioluminescent algae - but Nasa claims there is a far more 'fishy' explanation. It is thought the lights - the location of which would place them in the sea in the Gulf of Thailand - were in fact created by fishing boats. The offshore illumination comes from enormous arrays of bright green LED lights used to attract squid and other sea life to the surface. According to an October 2013 article on Nasa's Earth Observatory site by Michael Carlowicz: 'Fishermen from South America and Southeastern Asia light up the ocean with powerful lamps that attract the plankton and fish species that the squid feed on. Astronaut Reid Wiseman took the image from 200 miles (320km) above the planet and posted it on Twitter . The offshore illumination comes from arrays of green LED lights used to attract squid  to the sea surface . Short-finned squid live 260ft to 1,970ft (80m to 600m) below the surface feeding on shrimp, crabs, and fish. Lights causes their food to be attracted to the surface of the ocean . This, in turn, attracts the squid to the surface where they are easier for fishermen to catch with jigging lines. Scientists first noted such night-lighting of the seas in the late 1970s and early 1980s, while compiling the first maps of Earth at night. 'The squid follow their prey toward the surface, where they are easier for fishermen to catch with jigging lines. 'Squid boats can carry more than a hundred of these lamps, generating as much as 300 kilowatts of light per boat.' Scientists first noted such night-lighting of the seas in the late 1970s and early 1980s, while compiling the first maps of Earth at night. 'These lights help reveal the full range, patterns, and night-to-night variability of these fishing activities in striking detail,' said Dr Steve Miller, a Colorado State University scientist who works with VIIRS night time imagery. 'It's just another example of how much information exists in night lights measurements and how unique they are for coupling human activity with the natural environment in a way that conventional visible imagery cannot do .

"NSA spies have intercepted computer deliveries, exploited hardware vulnerabilities, and even hijacked Microsoft's internal reporting system all in the name of stealing data from some of their toughest targets. These latest revelations to emerge about the undercover work of the National Security Agency focus on the work carried out by an elite team of hackers known as Tailored Access Operations (TAO). Citing internal NSA documents, German magazine Der Spiegel said on Sunday that TAO's mission is ‘Getting the ungettable,’ and quoted an unnamed intelligence official as saying that TAO had gathered ‘some of the most significant intelligence our country has ever seen.’ The investigation followed earlier reports of the NSA (headquarters pictured) spying on Apple products, which suggested a 'backdoor' in iOS could provide hackers with valuable information. Apple said at the time that it had never worked with the NSA to deliberately weaken its products . Der Spiegel said TAO has a catalog of high-tech gadgets for particularly hard-to-crack cases, including computer monitor cables specially modified to record what is being typed across the screen, USB sticks secretly fitted with radio transmitters to broadcast stolen data over the airwaves, and fake base stations intended to intercept mobile phone signals on the go. The NSA doesn't just rely on James Bond-style spy gear, the magazine said. Some of the attacks described by Der Spiegel exploit weaknesses in the architecture of the internet to deliver malicious software to specific computers. Others take advantage of weaknesses in hardware or software distributed by some of the world's leading information technology companies, including Cisco Systems and China's Huawei Technologies, the magazine reported. Der Spiegel cited a 2008 mail order catalog-style list of vulnerabilities that NSA spies could exploit from companies such as Western Digital or Dell. Protestors hold up placards featuring a picture of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden and with the world Asylum on it during a march against the spying methods of the US in Hamburg, northern Germany on Sunday . The magazine said that suggested the agency was ‘compromising the technology and products of American companies.’ Old-fashioned methods get a mention too. Der Spiegel said that if the NSA tracked a target ordering a new computer or other electronic accessories, TAO could tap its allies in the FBI and the CIA, intercept the hardware in transit, and take it to a secret workshop where it could be discretely fitted with espionage software before being sent on its way. Intercepting computer equipment in such a way is among the NSA's ‘most productive operations,’ and has helped harvest intelligence from around the world, one document cited by Der Spiegel stated. One of the most striking reported revelations concerned the NSA's alleged ability to spy on Microsoft's crash reports, familiar to many users of the Windows operating system as the dialogue box which pops up when a game freezes or a Word document dies. Protestors hold up placards featuring a picture of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden during a march against the spying methods of the US in Hamburg, northern Germany on Sunday . The reporting system is intended to help Microsoft engineers improve their products and fix bugs, but Der Spiegel said the NSA was also sifting through the reports to help spies break into machines running Windows. One NSA document cited by the magazine appeared to poke fun at Microsoft's expense, replacing the software giant's standard error report message with the words: ‘This information may be intercepted by a foreign sigint (signals intelligence) system to gather detailed information and better exploit your machine.’ Microsoft did not immediately return a call seeking comment, but the company is one of several U.S. firms that have demanded more transparency from the NSA - and worked to bolster their security - in the wake of the revelations of former intelligence worker Edward Snowden, whose disclosures have ignited an international debate over privacy and surveillance. Der Spiegel did not explicitly say where its cache NSA documents had come from, although the magazine has previously published a series of stories based on documents leaked by Snowden, and one of Snowden's key contacts - American documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras - was listed among the article's six authors. No one was immediately available at Der Spiegel to clarify whether Snowden was the source for the latest story.","The latest NSA revelations focus on the undercover work of an elite team of hackers known as Tailored Access Operations .

"Mike Dixon, 46, from Reading, suffered a massive stroke soon after boarding a nine-hour night flight from the US and was unable to move or tell anyone . A man who had a massive stroke on a plane has told how it left him stuck in his seat for nine hours, unable to alert anyone to what had happened. Mike Dixon, 46, from Reading, was only given help and first aid after the plane landed and cabin crew spotted him still in his seat after everyone else had got off. The Microsoft employee, who couldn't speak or move as a result of the stroke, was then rushed by ambulance to hospital, where he spent 16 days before being allowed home. Mr Dixon, whose wife Moira and son were at home in Berkshire, was flying home alone to London from a business conference in Las Vegas when he was taken ill. Before boarding the Virgin Atlantic flight, he suffered a mini-stroke at his hotel, but did not realise this and boarded the plane home assuming he was just unwell. The father of one said: 'I didn't realise it was a stroke, I thought I'd slept funnily.  I assumed I could sleep it off and I'd be fine in the morning.' He said that after the mini-stroke, also known as a TIA (transient ischaemic attack), he felt as though he was drunk. 'I was unstable and banging into things,' he said.  'I don't know how I got through security at the airport - I think they thought I was drunk.' He then boarded the night flight and settled into his middle seat in a bank of three. 'The middle seat, when you're 6ft 4in, is bad enough, and I just lost all feeling.' Once there, he suffered a second, massive, stroke, which left him unable to tell anyone or even move for the entire flight. He said: 'I'm not sure exactly when it happened but it was pretty soon after I sat down.  My arm was twitching, so I sat on it, and then it just went numb.' Shock: Mr Dixon's wife Moira, 46, rushed to hospital to be told her husband had had a massive stroke . With the lights dimmed, Mr Dixon went unnoticed, even after the plane landed at Gatwick and passengers disembarked.  The man sitting next to Mr Dixon climbed over him to get out. He said: 'He asked me to move and obviously I couldn't, so he just climbed over.  Everything after that is a blur.' Cabin crew spotted Mr Dixon still in his seat in the otherwise empty plane, and came to his aid. He said: 'I think I knew then I would be looked after - the ambulance came onto the forecourt to get me off the plane. Mr Dixon said no-one suspected he had had a stroke because no-one expects someone in their 40s to have one . 'At the hospital my wife was told I'd suffered a stroke.' He added: 'I couldn't say many words, but there was a Scottish lady on my ward and I kept shouting 'Freedom' at her from the film Braveheart. 'I could sing, too - the nurse would sing Old Macdonald and I would make the pig noises.' After being allowed home, it took several months for Mr Dixon to be able to use his right hand, and six months for him to be able to hold a proper conversation. He said: 'My movement came back relatively quickly, but from my fingers to my elbow is still a bit sketchy. 'When I was in hospital I was given a coffee and because I couldn’t control my hand I squashed the cup. It just wasn’t working properly. 'It’s getting better every day and I look like a normal person apart from my right hand. 'The stroke has ruined me with numbers. I can’t do anything consecutively. I can’t do seasons or months - things that should be easy to do.' Eighteen months on from the stroke, Mr Dixon, who praised Virgin staff for reacting quickly once they realised what had happened, and even calling him days later to check how he was, said he's not surprised he went unnoticed during the night flight. He said: 'Nobody looks at you and thinks it’s going to be a stroke. If I was 10 or 20 years older then they might have thought about a stroke, but not at my age.' Mr Dixon, pictured at home with his dog Brodie, says Virgin staff were efficient when they realised he was ill . Strokes can be revealed with an MRI of the brain (file image, above) but there are other, more obvious, symptoms . Mike Dixon suffered, as many stroke patients do, a TIA, or early-warning mini-stroke before having a second, massive stroke. The Stroke Association says that one in 10 people who suffer a TIA go on to have a full-blown stroke within a week if they remain untreated. A TIA is a sign that part of the brain isn't getting enough blood. Each year more than 46,000 people have their first TIA. Doctors say people should remember the FAST test to help them diagnose if they or someone else has had a stroke or mini-stroke. F is for face - has the face fallen on one side?  Can they smile? A is for arms - can they raise both arms and keep them there? S is for speech - is their speech slurred? T is for time - it is time to call an ambulance if one of the above applies. Peggy Johns, a Stroke Association coordinator who supported Mr Dixon, said: 'Mike’s story highlights the fact that when someone has a stroke, often they cannot communicate. 'That’s why it’s so important to be aware of the symptoms of stroke, use the FAST test, and seek urgent medical . attention if you suspect a stroke. 'Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the UK and the emotional effects can be just as devastating as the physical. 'A stroke can happen out of the blue . and be very frightening. But with the right help and support many people . can build a life after stroke.'","Mike Dixon, 46, had a massive stroke soon after boarding a night flight .

"A bogus bride was caught out because she 'flinched' when her phoney husband-to-be touched her knee in a register office. Emilia Ginova, 22, was jailed today for posing as a blushing bride ready to walk up the aisle with her groom. But a court heard Ginova had only first seen Nigerian student Louis Esene on the day of the service - and was being paid £3,000 to take part in the sham marriage. Emilia Ginova (left), 22, was jailed today for posing as a blushing bride ready to walk up the aisle with her groom Louis Esene (right) in Pontypridd, South Wales . She was caught out by an eagle-eyed registrar who spotted her shocked reaction when Esene, 28, reached out to touch her leg. Registration officer Donna Davies said: 'The groom tried to touch the bride’s knee but she looked very uncomfortable. 'She flinched and there was no interaction at all. I knew it was a scam.' The marriage was stopped - and the pair were both arrested at the register office in Pontypridd, South Wales. It was later revealed that Esene wanted to stay in Britain because his visa had run out. The court was told a friend recruited Ginova - who is a Slovakian-born Roma - and was four months pregnant by another man at the time of the wedding. Esene and Ginova pleaded guilty to conspiracy to facilitate a breach of immigration law. Pontypridd: The couple tried to get married in the Welsh town but an eagle-eyed registrar stopped them . Prosecutor Rachel Knight said: 'The registrar was suspicious of Esene and Ginova when they had notified their intent to wed as they could not communicate with each other. 'She did not find it convincing in any way. 'It was part and parcel of a plan to circumvent immigration rules, which would allow him to work, access to the NHS, social security and housing benefit.' Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard the bogus bride and groom met first on November 22 last year - and spent the morning shopping for rings and a wedding dress. But the court heard Esene lost his temper when Ginova failed to 'learn her lines properly' - and threatened he could put 'anyone in a dress'. Both were jailed - Ginova, of Chatham, for 18 months and Esene, of Pontypridd, for 21 months.Esene will be deported to Nigeria at the end of his sentence . Judge Richard Twomlow said: 'It strikes at the integrity of the importance of marriage.'","Emilia Ginova jailed for posing as bride .

"Making the world’s thinnest material in a blender, simulating tsunamis and creating a cloak to render a person entirely invisible sound like ideas straight out of a sci-fi film. But scientists will today reveal their progress in turning these dreams into a reality. Europe’s top researchers will address an audience of 2,000 at the Ted Conference in Brussels, Belgium, to present the fruits of their ‘high-risk, high-gain’ labours, which have received millions of euros in funding from the European Research Council. The event will be live streamed at 13:15 GMT. One scientist will show how the world's stongest material, graphene (an atomic-scale model is pictured), can be made in a kitchen blender at the TED Conference in Brussels, Belgium today . Last week, scientists announced that they had discovered a new property of graphene – the world’s thinnest and strongest material - that could trigger an electric car revolution . But in order to make use of the discovery, experts must first discover how to make industrial quantities of the 'wonder material', which could be used for everything from flexible touchscreens to condoms. Today, Professor Jonathan Coleman, of Trinity College, Dublin, will reveal how graphene can be made in a kitchen blender. Together with his team, he has found a way to produce incredibly thin sheets of graphene, a nanometre thick, by using powdered graphite, which is found in pencil lead. To do this, he mixes the powder at high speed with an ‘exfoliating liquid’ to produce thin ‘monolayer flakes’. Professor Ulf Leonhardt, of Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, has been working for 15 years on making Harry Potter’s invisibility cloak a reality by using optics. A still is shown from the film . Dr Tiziana Rossetto, an expert in earthquake engineering at University College London, has created a tsunami simulator after seeing the chaos caused by the tsunami that devastated Sri Lanka in 2004. Her tsunami generator at the Wallingford hydraulic research station in Oxfordshire is 230 ft (70 metres) long and 13 ft (four metres wide) and produces long wavelengths linked to tsunamis. It contains a plethora of instruments to enable scientists to examine the way tsunami waves hit coastal defence structures and buildings, mirroring what happens in real life. It could be used to inspire new building designs which could survive the natural disasters . While the team has produced grams of the material so far, Professor Coleman said the method could be scaled up to produce tonnes of perfect graphene sheets. They are working on using the technique to create ‘industrially important’ materials too. Invisibility cloaks will also be discussed at the event. Professor Ulf Leonhardt, of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, has been working for 15 years on making Harry Potter’s invisibility cloak a reality using optics. He explained: ‘I work on connections between optics and quantum optics with ideas from general relativity – on the geometry of light. ‘Applications include experimental analogues of the event horizon, invisibility cloaking, and perfect imaging.’ Today, he will explain how he is pushing the laws of optics, which govern how light is bent and pass through lenses, to its limits, in a bid to develop an optical cloaking device. Invisibility cloaks could one day have obvious applications, such as hiding spies and military vehicles, but the professor told The Independent that his research could also shed light on the mysteries of dark energy, which is a repulsive force that physicists know very little about. He said: ‘Ideas that may seem outrageous can be pursued. If they are right they should be taken seriously, however peculiar they may seem. The significant thing is what they teach us.’ Dr Tiziana Rossetto has created a tsunami simulator after seeing the chaos caused by the tsunami that devastated Sri Lanka in 2004. This image shows a woman walking through the remains of her home . While Professor Leonhardt will explain how his work could unravel mysteries of the universe, Dr Tiziana Rossetto, an expert in earthquake engineering at University College London, will detail how she is working to save lives on Earth. She set about creating a tsunami simulator after seeing the chaos caused by the tsunami that devastated Sri Lanka in 2004. Many experts doubted it could be done because there is a shortage of data about rare tsunamis  and the waves are so long they are incredibly difficult to model. But she persevered to develop a lab-based model that will be used to change how buildings can be designed to survive tsunamis. Her generator at the Wallingford hydraulic research station in Oxfordshire is 230 ft (70 metres) long and 13 ft (four metres wide) and produces long wavelengths linked to tsunamis. It contains a plethora of instruments to enable scientists to examine the way tsunami waves hit coastal defence structures and buildings, mirroring what happens in real life. Ocean scientist Dr Laura Robinson is studying the ocean and its deep sea corals to predict how it may change in the future in the face of global warming. Stock image of a coral reef shown . She said the tool ‘allows us to contribute to a revolution in how we design buildings. It combines engineering with seismology, structural dynamics and even the social sciences.’ Her aim is to ‘save lives, and in doing so build a safer world for our children’. Ocean scientist Dr Laura Robinson of the University of Bristol, is studying the ocean and its deep sea corals to predict how it may change in the future in the face of global warming and will also explain her research at the event this afternoon. Her team has examined coral skeletons and sediments to analyse abrupt climate changes in the Atlantic over the past 30,000 years, collecting data to show how deep-sea ecosystems are affected by changes in the ocean such as the concentration of carbon dioxide and water circulation. ‘It is only through looking at the history of the earth's climate that we can predict what might happen in the future,’ she said. She hopes to discover the conditions required for cold-water deep-sea corals to survive in the central Atlantic in order to work out a way to protect species that are vulnerable to changes in ocean chemistry, using cutting-edge geochemical techniques. Scientists have discovered a surprising new property of graphene – the world’s thinnest and strongest material – that could accelerate the development of electric cars and other green technologies. Researchers have found that the newly discovered type of carbon graphite, which is found in pencil lead, allows positively charged hydrogen atoms or protons to pass through it. Their discovery could increase the efficiency of fuel cells for cars, because the cells generate electricity from hydrogen. The researchers, led by Nobel Prize winner Sir Andre Geim of Manchester University, who discovered graphene, said their finding raises the possibility that, in future, graphene membranes could be used to ‘sieve’ hydrogen gas from the atmosphere to generate electricity. This is because the one-atom thick material acts like a filter to allow protons to pass through it, while blocking the passage of other atoms. At just one atom thick, graphene is the thinnest material on Earth and is also 200 times stronger than steel. It was first isolated in 2004 by Sir Andre and his fellow researchers, who received a Nobel Prize in 2010 for their work. The material is impermeable to all gases and liquids, giving it the potential for a range of uses such as corrosion-proof coatings, packaging and even super-thin condoms.","Some of Europe’s top researchers will address an audience of 2,000 at the Ted Conference in Brussels, Belgium to explain their 'high-risk' research .

"Trying on a firefighter's helmet, allowing a young boy to hug his leg during a mass and phoning up his followers for a chat are just a few of the ways Pope Francis has attracted headlines in the last few months. And after years of negative press, the Catholic Church is basking in the 'Francis Effect' which has been credited with a 20 per cent rise in congregations in Britain, and similar boosts around the world. But who is the PR guru working quietly behind the scenes to help push Pope Francis forward and leading the Church out of one of its darkest spells following a slew of recent scandals? His name is Greg Burke and he is a senior media advisor to the Vatican. Drive: Greg Burke, the advisor for the communication of the Vatican Secretariat of State is the man behind the Vatican's PR machine . The Vatican, stung by communications blunders and mired in a leaks scandal, hired the American journalist in June 2012 from Fox News to help improve its relations with the media. Mr Burke, 53, a native of St Louis, Missouri, had been working for Fox for 10 years. Before that he worked for Time magazine in Rome for 10 years. He worked as a stringer for news agency Reuters in Rome early in his career and has also written several books, one about an Italian soccer team. In his previous jobs, he covered the illness and death of Pope John Paul II, the election of Pope Benedict XVI, the pedophile scandal, the VatiLeaks saga, and the crackdown on American nuns, reported The Daily Beast. Media savvy: One of the more amusing tweets Mr Burke wrote on his Twitter page . Modern age: Mr Burke regularly tweets and is credited with encouraging the Pope to join Twitter . 'A scandal is a scandal, and I’ve . reported on them all,' he says. 'It all had to be told, as much as . things are true, it’s good they’ve come out.' He grew up in a Catholic family with five brothers and sisters. He became a member of the controversial Catholic group Opus Dei when he was 18 and is a 'numerary' in the movement, a celibate layman. His papal politics may have developed since his earlier days when shortly before Pope Benedict was selected he reasoned that he was not in the running, reported Vice. 'He’s considered too conservative,' Mr Burke explained, noting that the former pope was called 'the ‘Panzer Cardinal’ because he took so many hits for the pope. Burke's role - a revolution in the . Vatican's communications structure - is similar to that of . communications advisers in the White House. He . reports directly to the Vatican's deputy secretary of state, Archbishop . Angelo Becciu, the third-ranking person in the Vatican hierarchy. This . week Pope Francis I took the time after his weekly Papal audience in . St. Peter's Square to bless a severely disfigured man. The Pope has . attracted headlines in the last few months . Trying on a firefighter's helmet, allowing a young boy to hug his leg during a mass and phoning up his followers are just a few of the ways Pope Francis has attracted headlines in the last few months . Seen it all before: The teenage pilgrims show Pope Francis their technology - but it appears he is well in tune with modern life . Although he can now be credited with helping to build Pope Francis's popular image, it seems Mr Burke was not initially keen when he was first called about the position when he was dining out for his father's 90th birthday. 'I told them no twice but the more I thought about it the more it seemed like the right thing to do. I can't imagine a more exciting challenge for me at this time,' Mr Burke told Reuters. He accepted the role at a troubling time for the Catholic Church - the Vatican had been bedeviled by communications blunders ever since Pope Benedict XVI's 2005 election, and was dealing with a scandal over Vatican documents that were leaked to Italian journalists. Mr Burke is the only person in the Vatican's communications structure with vast print and television experience from outside the sometimes insular world of Catholic media. 'I've had a lot of diverse media experience that I hope I can put to use for the Church that I love,' Mr Burke said at the time. When Mr Burke was appointed  Fr John Wauck, a professor at the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross in Rome told the Catholic Herald: . 'He’s a lay person, from the professional world, who understands how . theologians think and shares their faith… he’s well respected and . genuinely liked by the journalists in Rome.' 'He’s . an English-language media professional who knows Italy — the language, . the culture, the mindset — and the Vatican inside out. This is important because many of the Vatican’s difficulties with . the media stem from things getting lost in translation. Greg can help . prevent that.' Mr Burke has also guided the Vatican through the modern digital age - the Pope Benedict started tweeting a few months after he joined . Mr Burke is known for his American sense of humour. 'I actually thought I’d leave Fox [to] go work for a football club,' he told an auditorium full of reporters this year, reported Vice. 'Ended up in the Vatican. No free tickets to football matches – but really good seats at Christmas and Easter.' Mr Burke is on Twitter where he often posts humorous photos and tweets. One of them included a photo of popstar Jennifer Lopez in Italy alongside the caption: 'Was @JLo on a shopping spree for rosaries in Rome?' Another post shows a photo of a convertible red Ferarri alongside the caption: 'Parked just outside #Vatican, but safe to say it's not a new car for #PopeFrancis.' Mr Burke has also guided the Vatican through the modern digital age - the pope started tweeting a few months after he joined. At the time Mr Burke said the Twitter handle @Pontifex is appropriate for a number of reasons. 'The handle is a good one. It means ""pope"" and it also means ""bridge builder"",' he said. 'The Pope wants to reach out to everyone. Shrewd: The Vatican, stung by communications blunders and mired in a leaks scandal, hired the American journalist in June 2012 from Fox News to help improve its relations with the media . 'We are going to get a spiritual message. The Pope is not going to be walking around with a Blackberry or an iPad and no one is going to be putting words into the Pope's mouth. 'He will tweet what he wants to tweet,' Mr Burke said. Pope John Paul II's longtime spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, was also a member of Opus Dei. Last year Mr Burke said he didn't know what, if any, role his membership in Opus Dei played in getting his role. Opus is greatly in favor in the Vatican these days, particularly as other new religious movements such as the Legion of Christ have lost credibility with their own problems. 'I'm an old-fashioned Midwestern Catholic whose mother went to Mass every day,' Burke said last year. 'Am I being hired because I'm in Opus Dei?' he asked. 'It might come into play.' Founded in 1928, Opus Dei is part of the Catholic Church and has 500 members across Britain. The stated mission of the organisation - which means 'God's Work' - is to spread the Christian message and help people embrace Catholicism in their everyday work. But it has attracted controversy over its practices including self-flagellation and radical teachings that homosexual sex is a sin. Critics have also accused the organisation of brainwashing and being run like a cult. The ultra-conservative Catholic group became famous worldwide after its sinister portrayal in the bestselling novel and blockbuster, The Da Vinci Code. The film, starring Tom Hanks, is based on the Dan Brown novel which described Opus Dei as a murderous, power-hungry sect.","Greg Burke, 53, is a senior media advisor to the Vatican .

"Arsenal secured three crucial points in the Barclays Premier League with a 1-0 win over West Bromwich Albion on Saturday. Arsene Wenger will be glad to relieve the pressure mounting on him with the win, courtesy of a Santi Cazorla inch-perfect cross and a thumping header by Danny Welbeck. Here, Sportsmail's Kieran Gill rates each player after the first Premier League match of the day. WEST BROM . Ben Foster - 5.5 . Saw the good and bad of Foster. Did fantastic to deny Welbeck in the first half, but wasn't convincing at times. Had a scare while needlessly trying to skin Giroud. Got away with a couple of mistakes. Andre Wisdom - 5 . Tangle with Welbeck in the box saw Arsenal  appeal for a penalty. Did well at times in sticky situations, but Wisdom lost Cazorla during his decisive game-winning run. Joleon Lescott - 6 . Coped well when asked to at the back and was solid. Arsenal pressure eventually paid off. Lescott occasionally tried to help with set pieces up front, too. The good and bad of Ben Foster came out on Saturday as the West Brom goalkeeper had his ups and downs . Craig Dawson - 6 . Tasked with marking Giroud for the majority and did okay at the back with Lescott as his partner. Put a shift in. Largely helped West Brom remain in the tie until Welbeck's goal on the hour. Sebastien Pocognoli - 6 . Tried to help in attack down the left and work rate was impressive. Well and truly beaten in the air by Welbeck for his goal, though. Craig Gardner - 5 . A few misplaced passes here and there. Arsenal kept possession well in the middle. Had the one and only shot on target for Albion - and his tame effort drew ironic cheers from the home crowd. Sebastien Pocognoli is well and truly beaten in the air by Arsenal's Danny Welbeck for the opening goal . Youssuf Mulumbu - 4.5 . Needless dangerous play on the edge of his box while surrounded by Arsenal players, which almost led to the opening goal. Could have given away a penalty against Sanchez, too. Chris Brunt - 5 . Regularly found space down the left side but could not do a whole lot with it. Passing in opposition half left a lot to be desired. Gunners dominated the midfield. Graham Dorrans - 5 . An average performance from Dorrans. Saw a lot of the ball but needs to show more strength to cope in midfield. Chris Brunt of West Brom (right) regularly found space down the left but could not do a whole lot with it . Stephane Sessegnon - 6.5 . Looked a menace at times while in a rare attack for West Brom, but to little avail. End product missing. Unlucky to be substituted with Albion chasing the equaliser - crowd boos  justified. Saido Berahino - 7 . Kept quiet to begin with. Desperately unlucky to be flagged offside for a one-on-one chance, when he was in fact on. His powerful header that struck the crossbar almost brought about the equaliser. West Brom's Saido Berahino provided Albion's main goal threat against Arsenal at the Hawthorns . SUBSTITUTES . Victor Anichebe (on for Mulumbu 65') - 5 . Strong and powerful as Albion searched for a late goal. Couldn't find a shot. Cristian Gamboa (on for Pocognoli 75') - 5.5 . Georgios Samaras (on for Sessegnon 76') - 5 . ARSENAL . Damian Martinez - 6 . Untested throughout the entire first half. Made one save in his first Premier League start for Arsenal. Clean sheet but helped by the crossbar. Simple enough. Calum Chambers - 6.5 . Saw plenty of the ball and held the fort well in defence. Made more clearances than the rest of Arsenal's back four combined. Got himself forward, too. Per Mertesacker - 7 . Rock at the back. Won almost every header in his vicinity. Had a chance to score in the second half after a fumble by Foster but dragged his shot wide with plenty of bodies in the way. Per Mertesacker was a rock at the back for Arsenal as they kept a clean sheet against West Brom . Laurent Koscielny - 7 . Greatly missed. Excellent in defence on his return and made a big difference for Wenger. He and Mertesacker looked an ideal partnership. Nacho Monreal - 4 . Injured while trying to beat a man in defence for no apparent reason. Unwise decision. Substituted after 23 minutes as a result. Mathieu Flamini - 6.5 . A workhorse as per and well disciplined. Not the biggest impact but his passing was flawless. Laurent Koscielny has been greatly missed by Arsenal and looked excellent at the back for the Gunners . Aaron Ramsey - 5.5 . Got himself about well with a nifty trick here and there. Still looks a shadow of himself from last season, though. Four shots off target and selfish at times. Danny Welbeck - 8 . Started on the right but moved central. Could have given Arsenal the lead in the first half with a brilliantly-timed run. Did not fluff his lines with his thumping header in the second half. Alexis Sanchez - 6 . Fair few chances in the first half, though the majority were tame. Forever busy closing down the Albion defence. Managed just one shot on target however. Danny Welbeck (left) did not fluff his lines with his close-range header to give Arsenal the lead . Santi Cazorla - 9 . Made the goal that won Arsenal the match with a superb run down the left and inch-perfect cross. Had his fair share of chances from distance in the first half, but blocks and Foster denied him. Olivier Giroud - 6.5 . Decent enough first start. Stuck to his role well, allowing those around to play off him in the centre. Worked hard and unlucky to miss target from a tight angle after dispossessing  goalkeeper Foster. Santi Cazorla (left) proved the main man for Arsenal on Saturday and was instrumental in the victory . SUBSTITUTES . Kieran Gibbs (on for Monreal 23') - 6.5 . Wasn't expecting to be asked to contribute so early but joined the game well and tracked Pocognoli and Brunt on the left. Pace to burn. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (on for Giroud '78) - 6 .","Arsenal beat West Bromwich Albion 1-0 in the Premier League match .

"Apple has been accused of kowtowing to the Chinese government after it pulled a program from its China App store which allowed users to bypass the country's strict internet controls. The communist government of the People's Rebublic has passed laws which restricts internet browsing from IP addresses within its country, a project which has become known as 'the great firewall of China'. But developers from all over the world have tried to liberate China's online public by creating tools which allow users inside the country to bypass 'the wall' and see content they would be able to in the outside world. Kowtowing: Apple removed the OpenDoor app from its China App store after pressure from the state . Banned: The app was used by Chinese anti censorship protestors, above, who wanted to access websites which were banned by the government . One tool, a free app called Open Door, could be used by Chinese people to randomise their IP to keep their browsing information private and prevent them form being directed to censored content. It was being sold on Apple's Chinese version of the App Store until July this year, when it was pulled by the Californian computer giant who said that it contained 'illegal content'. Despite this, a version of the app is still available in the rest of the world. The developers of Open Door, who are small team of designers, say that the app was being downloaded around 2,000 times a day before it was pulled by Apple. They received no notification from App Store bosses that their product was set to be removed and were only made aware of its deletion when users from China got in touch to ask where it was. When they contacted Apple, the tech giant confirmed that the app had been banned because it contained content which was illegal in China, and that developers have to abide by laws in the country they wish to sell their software. The designers now say that they will not challenge the decision for fear that their other products will be banned globally. Speaking to CNN, a developer, who asked not to be named, said: 'Unfortunately, we're not aware of any app . developer ever (who was successful) in challenging Apple's decision. 'In fact, . we won't be surprised if Apple decides to pull our app from all app . stores and/or terminates our account in retaliation.' The . incident has sparked widespread criticism of Apple, who have been . accused of pandering to the authoritarian Chinese regime with Chinese . Open Door users accusing the company of 'surrendering to evil.' Big business: Apple have been accused of protecting its business interests in China by banning the app . Apple's stance on China is in stark contrast to that of its Silicon Valley rival Google. The search engine was once accused of cooperating with China's policy of censorship after it was revealed that a Google China search for 'Tienanmen Square', showed no sign of the famous defiant photograph of a protestor standing in front of a Chinese armoured tank. But Google has since changed its policy and has been at pains to make the search experience for Chinese browsers as liberal as possible. They even launched a tool which would tell Chinese users when they were searching for a term which was banned by the government. But after more clashes with the country's communist regime, the feature was banned at the start of this year.","Open Door app allows users to see content which is censored in China .

"Palaces, yachts, white gold watches and a £47,000 toilet on his plane are just a few of the . presidential perks Vladimir Putin enjoys, according to a damning new report. In 2008 the reinstalled Russian President  famously compared his life in office to a 'galley slave' during a press conference. But now a lavish list of luxuries at his disposal have been revealed by Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister turned Putin critic. Nemtsov estimated that the maintenance of Putin's . residences, jets and cars alone costs £1.6 billion a year. Life of luxury: Palaces, yachts, white gold watches, and a $75,000 toilet on his plane are just a few of the presidential perks  Vladmir Putin enjoys, according to a new report . The 32 page document listed 58 planes . and helicopters and 20 homes with opulent fittings worthy of the tsars, . not to mention 11 watches which alone are worth several times Putin's . annual salary. Published . under the ironic title 'The Life of a Galley Slave', it denounced the . lavish spending as an affront to millions of Russians living in dire . poverty. Among the 32-page report, eye-catching details included: . 20 palace and villas: with opulent fittings worthy of the tsars . 15 helicopters . 43 aircraft available include: an Airbus, two Dassault Falcon executive jets and an Ilyushin Il-96 airliner that features an $11 million cabin fitted out by jewelers -and that toilet which, the report says, cost close to £47,000 . 53.7-metre yacht: with a designer interior, a spa pool, waterfall and wine cellar . 11 luxury watches . Five-decked yacht:  with a jacuzzi, barbecue, a maple wood colonnade and a huge bathroom faced in marble . 'One of the most serious reasons . prompting V. Putin to hold on to power is the atmosphere of wealth and . luxury to which he has become accustomed,' wrote the authors. 'One of the most serious reasons . prompting V. Putin to hold on to power is the atmosphere of wealth and . luxury to which he has become accustomed,' wrote the authors. 'In a country where more than 20 million people barely make ends meet, . the luxurious life of the president is a blatant and cynical challenge . to society. We absolutely cannot put up with this.' The Kremlin . fleet of luxury yachts may draw comparisons to the lifestyles of . Russia's high-profile business tycoons, the 'oligarchs'. One 53.7-metre yacht with a designer interior, a spa pool, waterfall and wine cellar is relegated to second best, it said. 'The real diamond of the Kremlin . flotilla,' the authors judged, is a five-decked yacht with a jacuzzi, . barbecue, a maple wood colonnade and a huge bathroom faced in marble. The authors also identified from . photographs a total of 11 luxury timepieces on the wrist of the head of . state and calculated their total value at some £400,000, while noting . Putin had declared an annual income less than £700,000. The text was accompanied by . photographs of luxurious homes, jets, helicopters, cars and watches, . complete with footnotes citing Russian media as sources for many of the . items. Nine new residences had been added to the list available to the . president since Putin first became head of state in 2000, it said. Homes he could retreat to across the . country, ranged from seaside palaces to a ski lodge, and boasted . everything from saunas and billiard rooms to a 'presidential church'. While not addressing Putin's personal . wealth directly - the president once dismissed talk of him being a . billionaire as 'snot' from the noses of Western reporters and smeared on . paper - it challenged his self-portrayal as 'your humble servant' to . paint him as a callous, Nero-like figure ignoring the corruption and . poverty that has hobbled the economy and blighted lives. Lavish lifestyle: Putin has a pick of 20 palaces to spend time in - on the island in Lake Valdai there is a cinema, two restaurants and a bowling alley . Opulent time-keeping: The 32 page document, left, listed 11 watches which alone are worth several times Putin's annual salary . It juxtaposed Putin's latest declared . annual income and his account of . owning only three old cars with a description of some of the 700 . automobiles at the disposal of the presidential administration. The president has long denied rumors . that he has built up a vast personal fortune. The report did not address . that but it illustrated in 32 pages how the former KGB spy has expanded . the trappings of office since he rose to power in 2000. Despite . a wave of massive protests this winter that followed Russia's . fraud-tainted parliamentary and presidential votes, Putin remains . popular among average Russians, largely thanks to government-controlled . television networks that critics compare to Soviet propaganda. High-flyer: The report listed 58 aircraft that Putin had access to, including a $75,000 toilet . Eye-watering: The president's Ilyushin-96 airliner was reported to have cost $18m to be fitted out by jewellers and have a toilet that costs $75,000 . The Kremlin, which has long portrayed . the 59-year-old president as a man of simple tastes with a liking for . popular sports and active outdoor pastimes, did not immediately comment. Intended . to foster faint stirrings of opposition to Putin's recent re-election . for a further six years, the report may struggle for attention. In . a mark of the reluctance of Russians to challenge the Kremlin, Nemtsov . said he had struggled to find a printer willing to produce the booklet. And after publication, it was largely ignored by the country's major media outlets. Many . ordinary Russians seemed indifferent to opponents who reveled in . eye-catching details, such as the $75,000 toilet on a presidential jet. High maintenance: Nemtsov estimated that the maintenance of Putin's residences, jets and cars alone costs £1.6 billion a year . Tales of extravagance in the . leadership, though familiar to Russians throughout their history from . tsars to commissars, come at a potentially awkward time for Putin after . the biggest protests of his 12-year rule, mostly from middle-class urban . liberals who are now trying to fire up indignation more widely. 'I hope that after this report the . numbers of people believing that Putin and his allies are swindlers and . thieves will approach 70 percent,' Nemtsov said, using the labels for . the ruling elite which have become a slogan for the opposition. 'After that, I think we will be able to free the country of them,' he said at an event to launch the pamphlet. Though . Putin may have little leisure time Putin to enjoy the assets at his . disposal, and he can point to fellow world leaders enjoying special . transport and country retreats - such as the U.S. president's Air Force . One and Camp David - the report was scathing of the expense lavished on . Kremlin facilities. Speaking out: Opposition leader Boris Nemtsov (left) speaks as he presents the report in Moscow . Nemtsov, . a deputy prime minister in the 1990s, has become one of Putin's . fiercest critics and was among the leaders of a series of protests in . the past nine months. But . the president remains popular for bringing order after the chaos that . followed the collapse of communism in 1991, even if a recent opinion . survey found a majority would prefer a new leader come 2018. But the responses of the likes of . Moscow pensioner Yelena Nikitichna suggested it might be an uphill . battle to turn any dismay over Putin's perks into a boost for the . protest movement. 'It's obviously too much, way beyond . what is needed to do the job,' she said. 'But of course that is no . surprise to me. I've lived here for 70 years. It's always been like . that.' Among the young, too, many did not share Nemtsov's anger: . 'Russian authorities and leaders have . always been famous for their rather luxurious ways. This is a . historical pattern and he is not the first to live a fairly luxurious . life,' said Yelena Malmova, a first-year university student in the . capital. 'Personally, I don't care,' she said. 'For me, how well he does his job is most important.' Putin's press service was not immediately available for comment but his spokesman had earlier words on the report. 'All of this is government property and Putin uses it all legally as an elected president,' Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the RBK daily yesterday after parts of the report had appeared online.","He has access to 20 palaces and villas, a fleet of 58 aircraft and 4 yachts .

"A kitten cheated death after passers-by heard it meowing inside a battered black suitcase floating on a river. The blue-grey tabby was soaking wet, shivering and distressed but otherwise unharmed. He was taken to the passer-by's home until the RSPCA arrived to collect him. Lucky to be alive: Kitten found soaking wet and shivering in suitcase floating in river . The inside of the case was described as filthy and full of excrement . The 16-week-old kitten was found in Whitworth, Lancashire. The inside of the suitcase was described as filthy and full of excrement. RSPCA inspector Beth Clements said: 'How anyone could want to zip up such a gorgeous little thing in a case and throw him into the water like this is beyond me. 'It must have been a terrifying ordeal and he only survived by the skin of his teeth.' She added: 'But the kitten was lucky on two counts. 'Firstly, that the suitcase floated along the river. If it had sunk he would have died straight away. 'Secondly, that someone happened to pass that heard him meow and so able to save him and ring us for rescue. 'As it was the little thing has made a full recovery and should be ready for a happy new home very soon.' Survivor: RSPCA says kitten will recover from incident and will be ready for re-homing soon . It is thought the case was thrown into the river at 6.30am last Friday after reports from other passers-by. The woman seen throwing the kitten in is described as being in her mid-30s with light hair and heavy build. The kitten has been seen by a vet who said he was fit and healthy and so is being cared for in private boarding. As long as no one comes forward to claim him, he will be ready for re-homing after a week.

"Madonna has been accused of 'betraying' the family of her adopted daughter Mercy - as they issued a desperate plea to be allowed to see her. The grandparents of Mercy James have accused the star of cutting them out of her life and failing to meet a promise to keep her close to her roots. They also attacked 'white foreigners'  for taking children away from Africa. Saxon Maunde, grandfather of Mercy James who was adopted by Madonna in 2009, told MailOnline: 'Nobody has told me a thing about Mercy being in the country or about her welfare since she left us. 'She has my blood flowing in her veins. It is preposterous that I am not made aware of anything regarding her development.' The 69-year-old, who ekes out a living selling pots from a roadside stall, added that Madonna had, 'broken my heart and hearts of my family members,' saying that, 'she has shown no humanity at all towards us.' 'Betrayal': The grandparents of Mercy James, pictured in the straw hat with Madonna on her visit to Malawi yesterday, have accused the star of reneging on a promise to let them see her . Regrets: Saxon Maunde, Mercy James' grandfather, told MailOnline he bitterly regrets agreeing to allow Madonna to adopt his granddaughter . Thriving: Mercy James, pictured yesterday on her visit to Malawi, was adopted in 2009 by Madonna after a High Court agreed that the star did not need to be resident in Malawi for 18months prior to becoming a parent, but her family are upset that they have not seen her since . Bitter: Mercy's 69-year-old grandfather, who ekes out a living selling pots from a roadside stall, told MailOnline that the first time he heard Mercy James was in the country was via MailOnline and in newspaper reports . Saxon Maunde originally backed Madonna's bid to adopt his granddaughter because he believed she would get a good education, and convinced his reluctant ex-wife to agree the adoption papers. But today, as Madonna visits Malawi with Mercy James, he said he bitterly regrets his decision and accused Madonna of kidnapping a child of Africa. He said: 'White foreigners who decide to take our children away from Africa have no understanding of our culture. 'They don't realise that in our African families each one has a responsibility to the others. If a half-brother or half-sister does well, they share their fortunes with all of the others. 'A child like my granddaughter Mercy, if she succeeds in her career, she is expected to share that success with all of us. That is how our extended family system works.' Because of that system, he believed Mercy was being given the chance of a lifetime to travel to America for her schooling and would then return to help her family in Africa. 'I worked for a household years ago where a foreign lady took one of the children to be educated and brought up abroad, and that child came back as a doctor and improved the lives of every member of the family. That is what persuaded me to let Mercy go. 'Now I see that all she meant was that she would bring her here on holiday, stay in an expensive lodge for foreigners, and cut us – her real blood family – out of her life. That cannot be the right way to do things. No foreigner has the right to interfere in our culture like this.' His thoughts were echoed by his ex-wife Lucy Chekechiwa, also 69, who fears she may never see her granddaughter again. 'I am now old and sickly,' she said. 'I don't want to die before seeing my daughter.' Chekechiwa and Maunde's teenage daughter died days after Mercy's birth and so the family placed her at the orphanage because they could not take care of her. A tearful Chekechiwa said: 'We planned to take her back when she reached the age of six when she could eat solid food. But we were told a rich lady wanted to adopt her. We resisted at first but government officials convinced us this was good for Chifundo's future. We never thought we will not see our daughter again. Maunde says he now bitterly regrets signing the papers that allowed the 56-year-old pop star to adopt Mercy, whose teenage mother Mwandida, died days after giving birth. 'By putting a distance between Mercy and me and members of my family, she is being extremely unfair. Madonna, pictured with children Mercy James and David Banda yesterday, both nine, who she adopted from the African nation, has already helped to fund 10 schools in the country and her charitable efforts are not yet finished . Visiting Malawi: Madonna brought Mercy James to Gumulira village, about 80 km (50 miles) from the Malawian capital Lilongwe in April 2010 but Mercy did not see her family then . 'Please let us see our daughter': Saxon Maunde, Mercy James' grandfather, pictured over the weekend, just wants to see his granddaughter . Poverty: The grandfather of Mercy James, Saxon Maunde, pictured this weekend, ekes out a living selling pots but is not looking for any handout from Madonna, he says he simply wants to see Mercy . Anger: David Banda, Madonna's first adopted child, saw his father on a visit to the orphanage where he used to live during the visit to Malawi last week . 'We are extremely poor, but we do not need her money,' he added. 'A simple acknowledgement that we exist, that we are humans with feelings and that we do not wish to be disconnected from our child will be enough. 'What has happened to our family should be a lesson to anyone who may be approached by Madonna with promises to make lives of children better.' His guilt is compounded because it was he who convinced his reluctant family to let Mercy go. His now estranged wife, Lucy, fought to keep Mercy as a court battle raged over her fate four years ago. Lucy said: 'I didn't want her to go but as a family we had to sit down and reach an agreement and we agreed that Mercy should go. 'The men insisted that Mercy be adopted and I won't resist anymore. I still love Mercy. She is my dearest.' Now Maunde says he made a mistake when he facilitated Madonna's adoption of Mercy some four years ago. He has never accepted money from Madonna and is not looking for any - he says he simply wants to see his daughter. 'We did not donate our child to Madonna. We let Madonna have our child because we were told she is a philanthropist who would help give her a good education. 'What is the point of us wanting Mercy to get a good education and a good life if in the end she does not help her relatives?' With her adopted children Mercy James and David Banda, also nine, the Material girl has been visiting the east African nation to see the efforts of her charity Raising Malawi, first hand. Her 14-year-old son Rocco Ritchie also joined them on visits to schools and hospitals in the country where she funds a number of orphanages, including Home of Hope in the western border district of Mchinji where she adopted David, and Kondanani Children's Home in the southern tea-growing district of Thyolo. On Friday the pop legend met with Malawian President Peter Mutharika at the country's State House and later announced her plans to build 300 schools across Malawi. She also found time for David to visit his father Yohande, who farms tomatoes and maize in the central border district of Mchinji. Looking to adopt again? Madonna, centre, poses for a  picture yesterday with children in Kasungu, about 150 kilometers north of the Malawian capital Lilongwe . Charity work: Madonna poses for a  picture with children in Kasungu yesterday, about 150 kilometers north of the Malawian capital Lilongwe, where she has been working since 2006 with her non profit organization, Raising Malawi . Forgiven: Madonna had her 'VVIP' status restored by Malawi after being called 'arrogant' by the country's president in April last year. Yesterday she played with  her daughter Mercy as the girl's family issued a plea to see her . 'You have grown so big,' Banda senior told his son as they bonded over a game of football. Banda, who has since remarried and has another son, brought his son some gifts, including groundnuts and onions, in keeping with Malawian custom. But the news of this visit has only added to the heartbreak for Mercy's grandmother. 'Why do they always take the other child (David) to his people and not Chifundo to us,' Chekechiwa asked, using her Malawian name which translates to Mercy. 'What's the difference? Is it because the other one is a boy why my daughter is a girl?' She added that she fought to keep Mercy as a court battle raged over her fate five years ago. After protracted legal wrangling Madonna was allowed to keep Mercy, who she spotted during a visit to an orphanage with her then husband Guy Ritchie in 2006. Mercy's uncle, Peter Baneti - who also signed off Mercy's adoption papers in 2009 - said he was not sure whether or not he regretted signing off the papers. He said: 'I met Madonna in court and she assured me she would be bringing back my niece every other two years. Was she lying to me? This was in court. 'Government officials are my witness for they were translating our conversation.' Baneti, a tobacco farmer, said he doesn't know how to explain the situation to the family. He said: 'They are all looking to me for answers because I am the one who signed the papers. What should I be telling them?' Baneti also said that Mercy has a lot of cousins who want to see her - but are confused by her new life of luxury. He said: 'We tell them they have a cousin who is living oversees with a famous rich woman. They wonder why this famous rich woman should allow them to live in abject poverty while their cousin is living big. 'This is not good for Mercy herself. What will she think when she discovers her people are wallowing in poverty?' A representative for Madonna had not responded to requests for comment by the time of publication.","Mercy James' grandparents say they are desperate to see their little girl .

"Southampton and England striker Rickie Lambert appears a step closer to completing a move to Liverpool after undergoing a medical on Merseyside. The Anfield club are understood to have agreed a £4million deal for the 32-year-old, who was once on their books as an academy player. Liverpool are thought to be keen to complete a deal before Lambert heads to England's pre-World Cup training camp in the United States on Sunday. Lambert told Sky Sports News: 'The medical went well but as you know I can't say anything. 'I'll speak properly about it, hopefully, very shortly. 'It's been a crazy football year to be honest, the way it's carrying on.' Lambert arrived at Manchester airport after completing his medical with Liverpool . Flying high: Lambert spoke to sky sports News at Manchester airport after completing his medical . Dream move: Lambert struggled to hide his excitement at the prospect of joining Liverpool again . On his way: Rickie Lambert (left, next to Adam Lallana) has arrived at Liverpool for his medical . Smoke and mirrors: Liverpool were very protective of their prospective new signing on Saturday morning . On arrival: The club's doctor Zaf Iqbal was pictured leaving Liverpool Spire Hospital after the medical checks . Hotshot: Lambert has been Southampton's talisman since they won promotion to the Premier League in 2012 . The initial £4m fee will rise according to the appearances he makes, while the club were keen to keep his whereabouts under wraps. He arrived at Liverpool Spire Hospital at around nine o'clock on Saturday morning; after the medical, a club car reversed right up to the entrance before bundling the striker into the back. Lambert was then taken to the club's training ground at Melwood ahead of a flight back down to Southampton later in the afternoon. The 32-year-old, who began his career at Liverpool’s academy, will be the first major arrival in what is expected to be a busy summer for the club. He could even be followed by two of his team-mates from Southampton, as Liverpool are still negotiating for £25m-rated Adam Lallana and have also targeted Dejan Lovren to bolster their defence. A boyhood Liverpool fan, Lambert finally looks set to earn his big move after a career largely spent in the lower leagues. He wasn't deemed strong enough by Steve McMahon at Blackpool as a youngster before moves to Macclesfield, Stockport, Rochdale and Bristol Rovers. Alan Pardew then spent £1million to take the target man to St Mary's in 2009. Rodgers wanted the deal done before Roy Hodgson takes his side away to Brazil for the start of the World Cup. Lambert scored 16 goals for club and country last season and will provide the Premier League title chasers with a different option up front to supplement Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge.

"Up to 600,000 would-be migrants are in position to set sail from North Africa, in an onslaught on Europe’s coastline, the Italian government has warned. Italy, with its southernmost province just 80 miles from Libya, is the gateway for thousands of clandestine migrants washing up on Europe’s shores, since the Arab Spring left swathes of Northern Africa in chaos. More than 40,000 made the crossing last year, many on overcrowded and dangerous wooden boats. Investigators estimate that 20 per cent ultimately end up in Britain. Migration: A boat with African migrants  spotted by the Navy at sea near Lampedusa, Italy, in February this year, where hundreds of thousands are set to follow this summer . Italy’s Home Secretary Angelino Alfano said: ‘According to our information between 300,000 and 600,000 people are on the other side of the Mediterranean on the North African coastline, waiting to cross sooner or later.’ Speaking at a conference on immigration in Palermo he said that Italy would 'fight' the rising tide. ‘The frontiers of the Mediterranean are European and we must all protect them,’ he added. In the first three months of this year 11,000 have landed in Italy, a seven-fold increase on last year, with the season for crossings about to begin as the weather improves. The boom, he said, was as a result of the instability of the regimes in Sub-Saharan Africa and the growing strength of criminal organisations and traffickers. Italy is the gateway for thousands of clandestine migrants washing up on Europe¿s shores, seen here are a group of north-African asylum-seekers rescued by the coast guard in 2013 . Risky journey: More than 40,000 immigrants made the crossing into Italy last year, many on overcrowded and dangerous wooden boats (stock image) At present clandestine migrants landing in the EU are obliged to remain in the country where they first seek asylum. But southern Mediterranean counties have complained that just six or seven EU members including Greece and Malta bear the brunt of ‘boat people’ washing up on their shores. Italy planned to use its presidency of the EU starting this year to have the rules modified so that migrants can proceed to northern Europe, Mr Alfano said. Last year following the tragic shipwreck off the island of Lampedusa, that claimed more than 300 lives, European ministers were asked to pitch in to lend ships and aircraft to EU border agency Frontex to help stem the tide of migrants.","Several hundred thousand migrants set to enter Europe, Italy warns .

"A high school valedictorian and two of her female friends have gone on trial for allegedly forcing girls as young as 13 into prostitution after luring them on the promise of friendship. The defendants - two 16-year-olds and a 17-year-old - allegedly used social media to invite their victims to a social housing complex in Ottawa, before stripping, robbing and photographing them. They then allegedly drugged the girls and made them perform sex acts on johns before taking the money they made. If the girls would not comply, they were allegedly beaten. Seven victims aged between 13 and 17 have come forward, explaining to police that they met their alleged attackers through social networking sites, including Facebook, or community projects. Accused: Two of the three teenage girls who allegedly ran a prostitution ring from an Ottawa apartment . The alleged attacks have stunned Ottawa community - not only for the heinous nature of the crimes inflicted on their peers, but because the girls were promising students and the 'go to' babysitters. They were arrested last June - when they were just 15 and 16 - and their trial began this week, with all girls pleading not guilty to 74 charges. The trial is expected to last four weeks. The defendants allegedly led the prostitution ring between April and June last year, the Ottawa Citizen reported. The victims believed they were going to the apartment to socialise with the girls - but when they arrived they were told they were going to be escorts. Police said victims reported that they were made to drink alcohol or smoke marijuana before forced into high heels and made to have sex against their will. Two of the victims said they were raped. Scene: Seven teenage girls said they were lured to this housing complex on the promise of friendship . Horror: The girls, aged 13 to 17, said they were stripped, robbed and photographed nude . The defendants allegedly made one fifteen-year-old girl pose nude and beat her so badly that her injuries were still visible in police photographs taken weeks later. One 17-year-old victim said she arrived at the home and was forced to pose nude before being picked up by a john who made her wear a pink bathing suit before raping her, prosecutors said. She was paid $180 but the girls took the money from her. They allegedly said she had not earned enough and she was sent to meet another man - who put her in a cab when she started crying. Another girl who was just 13 was left at the apartment by her mother, who thought her daughter was having a sleepover with the girls. But the young girl returned home the next day in high heel boots and a trench coat and said she had been made to pose for nude photographs, prosecutors said. Courthouse: The girls are now on trial in Ottawa on a total of 74 charges and could be sentenced as adults . She was allegedly taken to a man's apartment, but he refused to have sexual contact with her when he realized she was there against her will. Another girl said she was attacked by one of the girls when she said she wanted to leave. 'She's on my time,' one of the defendants allegedly said. 'She goes home when I’m ready to go home.' Police allegedly found nude photographs of that girl on the defendant's cell phone. Investigators also allegedly found victims' clothing at the apartment and numbers for 'tricks' in the cell phone. At the apartment, the bedroom was covered with messages in marker, such as 'sex is like chocolate' and 'money over everything $', the Citizen reported. Victims: (File picture) The girls told police they were beaten if they did not comply with the demands . One of the alleged attackers also called herself the 'female bill gates' on Twitter. 'Ain't no problem like a hoe problem,' she tweeted. 'I've got hoe problemssss.' The charges against the girls include human trafficking, abduction, forcible confinement, robbery, sexual assault, assault, and printing and publishing child pornography. Prosecutors want the girls to be sentenced as adults if they are found guilty. This could see them behind bars for up to 14 years. A juvenile sentence would be just three years. The two younger girls remain in jail while the oldest is out on bail.","Two 16-year-old girls and one 17-year-old are on trial for running prostitution ring in Ottawa, Canada between April and June last year .

"Shortage: The price of olive oil has soared by 30 per cent since last month following a poor harvest over the summer which has led to production shortfalls . The price of olive oil has soared by a third in just one month after poor harvests in Europe caused by the hot summer decimated production, according to a new report. Drastic shortfalls in production have led to a leading supplier of olive oil describing this year as 'the most difficult I have ever seen' after the price of oil rose by 30 per cent. The latest research shows that prices of extra virgin Italian and Spanish oil have been rising throughout the year, but new data from commodity analysts Mintec revealed a 30 per cent month-on-month surge in recent weeks. Trade magazine The Grocer said the situation was not getting any better. Italy is currently the largest exporter of olive oil while Spain is the largest producer. The latest report suggests that the key problem with this year's crops was the above-average dry and warm weather throughout the Mediterranean olive growing belt in May and June. This affected the olive trees during the blooming period when moisture is vital to ensure olive growth and the eventual oil yield. However, the problem was compounded in Spain as trees were already under stress as a result of record output of production last year. In addition, trees in Italy continue to suffer from an olive fruit fly that lays its eggs in the olive and feeds on the fruit. The olive fruit fly or Bactrocera oleae, lays its egg in a hollow in the olive and when hatched the larvae tunnels its way out gnawing at the flesh destroying the fruit. Only those larger farms with technical prowess to treat their trees with pesticides manage to reduce their losses. Walter Zanre, managing director of Filippo Berio – one of the leading brands of olive oil - told The Grocer: 'Poor crops in Italy and Spain combined with the virtual absence of carryover stock in the Mediterranean make this the most difficult year I have ever seen for olive oil.' Mintec said that Spain's 2014/15 production is forecast to be down 50 per cent year-on-year at 875,000 tonnes while Italian olive oil production is expected to be down 35 per cent year-on-year to 302,000 tonnes. Early estimates of global production are down 19 per cent year-on-year and, despite last year's record-breaking production, demand is forecast to outstrip supply in 2014/15. New data from analysts Mintec shows how the price of Spanish olive oil (indicated in red) and Italian olive oil (shown in green) has risen since 2013. The price of Italian oil has now risen beyond the five euro per kg mark . Bad crop: Trees in Italy continue to suffer from an olive fruit fly that lays its eggs in the olive and feeds on the fruit. When hatched, the larvae tunnels its way out, gnawing at the flesh ultimately destroying the fruit . Loraine Hudson, an analyst at Mintec, said there had been some resistance to the hikes by buyers. She told The Grocer: 'Producers are refraining from buying at present. 'A drop in demand could cause prices to fall, however it is expected they will remain high due to poor crop production and quality.' Last month, it emerged that the price of olive oil was expected to soar beyond £2. Silvio Bandinelli, of the Tuscan Olive Growers Coop, said: ‘The new oil will cost 2-3 euro more per litre compared to last year, or an average of 10 euro a litre.'","Spain's production of olive oil forecast to be down 50% to 875,000 tonnes .

"Justin Bieber's monkey is at the centre of an animal welfare row after it emerged it was taken from its mother when it was only nine or 10 weeks old. Austrian vet Kurt Grabenwoeger said it was 'monstrous' that the pop star had brought Capuchin Mally with him on a flight from Los Angeles to Germany when it should still be bonding with its mother. And Bieber, due to perform at a concert in Hamburg this evening, was also criticised for not bothering to contact the quarantine centre where the animal is now being held to check on its welfare. Scroll down for video . Monkey business: Justin Bieber with pet Mally before it was taken away by customs at Munich Airport . Mr Grabenwoeger said: 'These monkeys not only need to be with their mothers for at least a year - but they should also be surrounded by their family group. 'They are living creatures - not celebrity accessories like a handbag. Imagine a human baby sent off on a world tour at 10 weeks - would anyone allow that?' Mr Grabenwoeger's warnings were echoed by the head of the animal quarantine station in Germany where Justin Bieber's baby monkey Mally is quarantined who said that he seemed nervous and confused at being in a cell - and had refused to eat at first. Infant: According to vets at the German quarantine centre where it is . being held, Justin Bieber's pet monkey was taken from its mother when it . was only nine or ten weeks old . Behavioural problems: The baby monkey refuses to eat unless it is given . a cuddly toy which vets believe acts as as a kind of surrogate parent . Bieber, currently in Hamburg for a concert on his global Believe tour, was given the animal for his 19th birthday . In an interview with Central European . News Munich animal shelter boss Karl Heinz Joachim, 64, said: 'I can . confirm that the monkey is 14 weeks old and was apparently taken away . from its mother when it was between nine and 10 weeks old. 'This is much too early. 'It's . obvious that those who were looking after it should have known - we . could not get him to eat until we gave him the cuddly toy he was still . clinging to when he was delivered to us and you can see in photographs . of Bieber that the only way they manage to keep it under control was by . using the cuddly toy. You can see pictures of him with two blonde girls and the cuddly toy. This obviously acts as a kind of surrogate parent, and as long as he can hold onto the toy he feels more secure and then started eating okay. Justin Bieber's pet monkey Mally is held by keeper Konrad Dressler at the Munich-Riem animal shelter in Munich . Justin Bieber's pet monkey Mally sits in the quarantine station at the Munich-Riem animal shelter in Munich after being seized at the city's airport . Quarantined: Justin Bieber had arrived in Munich without the necessary documents for the animal . 'But he is clearly traumatised are being taken away from his family group.' He . added that as well as being separated from the mother it should be . illegal to keep any of the monkeys in isolation from others of the same . species - and added that in his opinion nobody who possessed a Capuchin . monkey should have fewer than five others for their mental well-being. In addition when interviewed on Tuesday . morning he added that the future of the 14 week-old-male baby Capuchin . monkey was unsure not only because of its psychological well-being but . also because until now nobody from Bieber's management team or indeed . the star himself had been in touch to enquire how it was doing. Idol: Pop star Bieber performs at the  02 Arena in London last month . Vet and animal expert Grabenwoeger . confirmed that at 14 weeks it is still classified as a baby and won't be . an adult until it reaches the age of around eight. In . captivity they typically live until the age of around 45, and early . experiences with its mother and others in the family group help the baby . monkeys to learn correct behaviour and sets them up for a stable . development. Bieber flew . into the airport in Munich with the monkey on board his private jet . without any of the necessary paperwork and it was confiscated by customs . officials on Thursday. A spokesman said that the monkey had . been quarantined because it did not have the necessary paperwork . specifying that it was free of diseases including rabies. In addition there was no paperwork to prove the origins of the monkey - which is a protected species and needs to travel with certification that it was born in captivity and legally acquired and not for example as a result of being smuggled from its South American homeland. Karl Heinz Joachim added that the way the monkey had been treated up until now being taken through a noisy airport and onto a jet that would have probably have left it terrified had shocked him. He added: 'It happened and we are where we are now. What matters is what is best for the monkey in the future. I don't know what the laws are in America but I am surprised it was allowed to separate the mother and baby so young.' A spokesman for the Munich customs office Thomas Meister confirmed that the monkey had been handed over to the quarantine station and that so far the necessary paperwork had not been provided so that they can authorise the monkey be released. But he said there was no question that Bieber face prosecution as it was purely a question of the fact the missing paperwork meant that the monkey was a potential health risk and that as long as this would be provided in theory the monkey should be handed back to the star. Karl Heinz Joachim added that as long as the cuddly toy was present the monkey was managing: 'The monkey seems to particularly like sweet things. 'Mainly that means apples, raisins and milk pudding. It is obvious it is used to human company. It keeps calling a lot for company - without its cuddly toy it won't eat at all.' A spokesman for the pop star said: 'Justin and his team have been very concerned about the monkey’s condition and are hoping everything is resolved soon.'","Male Capuchin monkey 'Mally' is being held in quarantine in Germany .

"Raza Laskar, 32, admitted a string of sex offences against young boys and possessing indecent images . A paediatrician has admitted a string of sex offences against young boys including sexual activity with a child and possessing more than a million indecent images. Raza Laskar, 32, of Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, is charged with 31 offences committed against 12 boys after he was caught by police with a cache of vile child pornography. Detectives raided his home after 1,600 files suspected to contain indecent photographs of children were made available on a file sharing site between Christmas Day last year and January 27. Investigators from Greater Manchester Police linked the IP address to Laskar's home and a search was carried out on May 2, where officers seized a number of computers and data storage devices. The force's high tech crime unit and an external firm, commissioned to carry out the work because of the large amount of data, found 1.2million images and videos. During a search of the various gadgets they discovered chat logs and videos of Laskar engaging in sexual acts with a child, recorded in a hotel room he had booked. Officers were able to identify other child victims Laskar groomed and incited to engage in sexual activity - some of them were based in the UK while others lived in foreign countries. Before his arrest Laskar had worked in hospitals across Greater Manchester. Detective Inspector Theresa Carter of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Raja Laskar is a person who lived two very different lives. 'Like Jekyll and Hyde, he is vastly different in moral character depending on the situation, going from caring for and treating children to deliberately targeting, grooming and abusing them. 'He has admitted a vast number of appalling child sexual abuse offences and the size and the scale of this operation obviously came as a shock to the investigation team when you consider his background allied with the scale of his offending. 'His profession will obviously be an aggravating factor and one that many people will be extremely concerned about. 'While I can stress that we found no evidence that he committed any offence during the course of his employment, it will be of absolutely no comfort to the boys and the families of the boys he targeted online. He admitted the charges at Manchester Crown Court today and is due to be sentenced in January next year . 'The one thing I would like to highlight on the back of this is internet security and awareness. 'It is so important, in this digital age where even young school children have the internet in the palm of their hand that they know about the dark side of the web. 'There are dangers lurking if the right precautions are not taken and I would encourage parents to talk to their children and discuss what websites they are visiting, who they are talking to and what to do if approached by someone who asks them to engage in sexual activity.' Laskar appeared at Manchester Crown Court today and admitted the charges, which include six counts of causing or inciting child pornography, one count of taking indecent photographs and eight counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. Among the charges are five counts of voyeurism and three counts of sexual activity with a child. He will be sentenced on January 9 next year.","Raza Laskar, 32, is charged with 31 offences committed against 12 boys .

"Liverpool striker Luis Suarez would find it 'very difficult to say no' to Real Madrid if they made a move for him this summer, according to his lawyer. The 27-year-old Uruguayan tried to force through a transfer to Arsenal last summer before enjoying a prolific season with Liverpool, winning the Premier League's golden boot and the European golden shoe after scoring 31 goals. Suarez was also voted the PFA Player's Player of the Season and the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year for 2013-14.

Loved: Suarez's lawyer also says he knows he is 'adored' by the Kop so it would need to be a 'huge offer' Liverpool came agonisingly close to winning the title last season, eventually finishing second to Manchester City, and Suarez claimed earlier this month that he wanted to stay at Anfield. But his lawyer, Alejandro Balbi, has revealed that the striker would find it hard to resist a move to Spain's capital to join up with Carlo Ancelotti's side, who won a record 10th Champions League last season. Balbi told Cadena SER: 'A year ago he was very likely to leave Liverpool (for Arsenal). 'Now I think it is very difficult because he is an idol, although clubs can offer a lot of money. 'If there is such a big offer from Real Madrid, it would be very difficult to say no. Luis Suarez has always had a predisposition for Spain.'

"Asian actress Somi Guha, 36, is taking legal action against the BBC over alleged racism by Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson . An actress is suing the BBC for up to £1million after Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson allegedly made a racist remark during the series finale of the show. Indian-born Somi Guha, 36, has instructed lawyers after Clarkson used the word 'slope' - a derogatory term for people of Asian descent - in the Top Gear Burma special. Ms Guha claims that broadcasting Clarkson's comment amounts to unlawful discrimination by a public body. Her lawyers, Equal Justice, claim her action could cost . the BBC £1 million in punitive damages under equality laws unless it . apologises and takes the hit motoring show off the air. They say she is one of a group of people who were offended by the term - and so sought legal advice from the firm, who previously worked on racism allegations surrounding reality show Celebrity Big Brother. A BBC spokeswoman for Top Gear said the Corporation had no comment on Miss Guha's action. Clarkson used his Twitter account today to respond to the allegation, and said: 'I'm not a racist. I am currently sitting in a bar with a man who lives quite near Wales.' In the series finale, the three hosts - Richard Hammond, James May and Jeremy Clarkson - are tasked with building a bridge over the River Kwai in Thailand. After completion, Clarkson, 53, said: 'That is a proud moment, but there's a slope on it', as a man walked towards him on a makeshift bridge. Co-presenter Richard Hammond, 44, replied: 'You're right, it's definitely higher on that side.' Scroll down for video . In this scene in the show, Jeremy Clarkson said: 'That is a proud moment, but there's a slope on it.' The phrase 'slope' is a derogatory term for someone of Asian decent . At the time, some viewers were left . outraged by the 'slope' reference, described by Twitter users as 'not . big, not clever, not funny' and 'a gag too far'. Miss . Guha, of Tower Hamlets, east London, starred in 2006 sci-fi movie . Children of Men and has also appeared in hit ITV show The Bill. In . her formal written complaint to the BBC, she says: 'Casual racism in . the media by established BBC stalwarts is constantly brushed aside. 'Discrimination within the industry is accepted. Racial profiling of roles is accepted and expected. 'I find it offensive that Jeremy Clarkson refers to people of different races in pejorative terms. The three hosts during the Burma special. Equal Justice, the lawyers representing the actress, say the suit could cost the BBC up to £1million . 'What is that saying to children who watch him? - that it's OK to bully and make racist comments . 'Jeremy Clarkson has made derogatory comments about Mexicans. Now he bullies an Asian person. It has to stop.' The next step for Miss Guha would be to apply to a county court under the Equality Act. Equal Justice, a firm specialising in discrimination cases, is demanding that the BBC investigates Clarkson's comment. In . a letter to BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten on Miss Guha's behalf, it . writes of Clarkson: 'He and the show must be censured to ensure that . another race or nation is not targeted. Clarkson is not unfamiliar with controversy. During a press conference in Australia in 2009, Clarkson branded then Prime Minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot' Equal Justice previously worked on racism allegations surrounding the late Jade Goody, pictured, Danielle Lloyd, and singer Jo O'Meara when they appeared on a series of Celebrity Big Brother . 'It . was the BBC's failure to effectively sanction him about the racism . against Mexican people that allows him to have the confidence to now . attack people of Asian descent. He believes himself to be unaccountable. 'It is clear gross misconduct on his part and would be in any modern British workplace. 'Please . process this complaint as a matter of urgency and give due . consideration to not recommissioning Top Gear for another series until . these matters are addressed.' Equal Justice's Lawrence Davies said today: 'The BBC refuses to tackle serial offender Jeremy Clarkson. 'The BBC defends his behaviour as British humour but it is offensive, casual racism being used to boost ratings. It is shameful and makes the BBC appear to be institutionally racist.' Mr Davies previously worked on racism allegations surrounding Celebrity Big Brother - which at that time was shown on Channel 4. The controversy centred on comments made  late Jade Goody, glamour model Danielle Lloyd, and singer Jo O'Meara, which were directed towards Indian actress Shilpa Shetty. Equal Justice previously represented Mexican student Iris de la Torre when she accused Clarkson and Hammond of bigoted comments about her countrymen. Hammond branded Mexicans 'lazy, feckless and flatulent' while Clarkson claimed its ambassador to the UK would not complain because he would be snoring in front of his embassy TV. In 2008, the show was rapped by the . BBC Trust for showing Clarkson and fellow presenter James May sipping . gin and tonic at the wheel during a stunt. During . a press conference in Australia in February 2009, Clarkson branded then . Prime Minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot' Earlier . this year, Clarkson was forced to apologise for posting a picture of . himself asleep on a plane, with a sign with the words 'gay c**t' written . on it, and an arrow pointed at himself. In 2011, Hammond was discussing a . Mexican sports car and suggested that vehicles reflect the national . characteristics of the country they are from. He . said: 'Mexican cars are just going to be lazy, feckless, flatulent, . leaning against a fence asleep looking at a cactus with a blanket with a . hole in the middle on as a coat.' The . Mexican ambassador Eduardo Medina-Mora Icaza did make a formal . complaint to the BBC and called on the presenters to make a public . apology for stirring 'bigoted feelings against the Mexican people'.

"The head of Energy UK has claimed the Big Six energy firms do not make large profits – despite the £3.7billion they raked in last year. Angela Knight, chief executive of the body that represents the energy giants, made the claim as details emerged of the widespread tax avoidance employed legally by energy firms. It was also revealed that companies are making an estimated £36million a year in interest on the credit built up by customers paying via direct debit. Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK, has said power companies' profits are not that large, as details of legal tax avoidance start to emerge . Politicians including former prime  minister Sir John Major and Labour leader Ed Miliband are clamouring to rein in the energy firms. But Miss Knight, a former Tory MP, said: ‘They might be politically popular, but price freezes have never worked and never will work,’ she said. ‘Windfall taxes have taken place in the past where there have been windfall profits. The profits here of four or five pence in the pound aren’t particularly big.’ But her claims were immediately  dismissed by Caroline Flint, Labour’s energy spokesman, who said: ‘Last year the Big Six energy companies made over £3.7billion in profits, so the idea that these companies aren’t making any money is completely and utterly ridiculous. 'The public know they’re being ripped off and they’re not going to be fooled by lobbyists working for the energy giants.’ While the Big Six – British Gas, SSE, nPower, E.On, EDF and Scottish Power – make profits of around 4 or 5 per cent from supplying energy to households and businesses, they make an average of 22 per cent from generating electricity, sourcing and storing gas, and transporting energy. Big firms are also believed to be stockpiling as much as £2billion in credit from those who pre-pay via direct debit. While firms make around 5 or 6 per cent profit supplying energy into homes, they make nearer 22 per cent for generating power . Energy Minister Greg Barker promised to ‘come down like a ton of bricks’ on energy providers accumulating cash from householders’ direct debits. A whistleblower at British Gas told The Observer that the energy giant boosts its own profits by using  millions of pounds of credit built up by former customers. The provider has taken £20million from customers with outstanding credit over the past year. Despite huge profits, firms can legally reduce tax bills by exploiting loopholes that  allow their owners to lend them money via the Channel Islands Stock Exchange. It emerged that Scotia Gas, UK Power Networks and Electricity Northwest avoided paying a total of £140million in tax by racking up interest on debt to their owners. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said on yesterday’s Andrew Marr Show on BBC1 that he was ‘livid’ about tax avoidance, adding: ‘Everybody needs to pay their fair share.’ More than three million older people are worried about staying warm indoors this winter – with six million anxious about rising fuel bills, says Age UK. But the charity said many are unaware of the potentially fatal consequences of living in poorly heated housing.","Angela Knight has said that energy profits 'aren’t particularly big'

"Rio Ferdinand will not appeal his three-game ban for using the word ‘sket’ - slang for a promiscuous female - on Twitter. The QPR defender was handed the punishment by the FA last week, who found him guilty of misconduct for abusing another user on the social media platform on September 1. Ferdinand insists he used the term as a joke and has now received the written reasons for the ban from the FA. Rio Ferdinand has been given a three-game suspension by the FA and will not appeal his ban . Ferdinand was charged with misconduct for this tweet, made on September 1, for using the slang term 'sket' Ferdinand is active on social media, with 5.9million followers on his Twitter page and over 14,500 tweets . However, despite being unhappy that just one language expert was used to decide his fate, Ferdinand has decided that appealing would be a waste of time and money. He feels that appeals are rarely successful and it would cost him in the region of £30,000. That means Ferdinand’s punishment of a three-game ban, £25,000 fine and order to attend an education programme stands. Although Ferdinand accepts that his response on social media to a tweet about his performances in a QPR shirt was inappropriate, other players have escaped FA scrutiny for similar offences. Ferdinand tweeted his anger at the FA'S punishment on Friday . Joey Barton took to Twitter to support his team-mate Ferdinand, describing his ban as 'an absolute disgrace' Harry Redknapp criticised Ferdinand's ban and believes footballers would be better off without Twitter . Such is the former England defender’s anger, that he is considering withdrawing his support from future FA initiatives, as revealed by Sportsmail last week. The 35-year-old slammed the FA's punishment as 'ludicrous' on Twitter last week. He wrote: 'Is humour even allowed....I'm baffled! Ludicrous.... & I don't mean the rapper'. He was immediately backed up by his team-mate Barton, who wrote: 'Surely a person has the right to be offensive? Especially if someone offends you? Shambolic that @rioferdy5 misses 3 games and loses £25k.' Barton then went on to question the FA's rules about what is and isn't offensive. Barton didn't hold back on Twitter, sarcastically questioning whether he could expect a ban from the FA . Ferdinand’s manager Harry Redknapp also criticised the ban, which was at the same level as a red card for a two-footed tackle. Redknapp said: ‘The same as a two-footed challenge? No. If someone slags him off and he goes back and slags them off. It doesn’t equate. I genuinely don’t know what goes on on Twitter. It would save all the hassle if no-one was on Twitter.’ Ferdinand also received support from Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker, who tweeted: 'Must say I think the @rioferdy5 3 game ban is ridiculously harsh. A little warning would have sufficed, surely.'","QPR defender insists he used term as a joke but believes any appeal would be a waste of time and money .

"North Korea stepped its war rhetoric today by threatening to go beyond carrying out a promised third nuclear test in response to what it believes are 'hostile' sanctions imposed after a December rocket launch. The North frequently employs fiery rhetoric aimed at South Korea and the United States and in 2010 was blamed for sinking a South Korean naval vessel. It also shelled a South Korean island in the same year, killing civilians. It did not spell out the actions it would take. The North is not capable of staging a military strike on the United States, although South Korea is in range of its artillery and missiles and it can hit Japan with its missiles. Tensions: A researcher looks at radiation detection monitors at the Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety in North Korea as the secretive state threatened to carry out measures 'stronger than a nuclear test' Threat to world peace? A man walks past a display illustrating the damage a 1MT class nuclear weapon would cause if detonated in Seoul, at the War Memorial Museum of Korea in Seoul on February 5 . 'On a war footing': South Korean and U.S. troops began naval drills on Monday in a show of force partly directed at North Korea amid signs that Pyongyang will soon carry out a threat to conduct its third atomic test . 'The DPRK (Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, or North Korea) has drawn a final conclusion that it will have to take a measure stronger than a nuclear test to cope with the hostile forces nuclear war moves that have become ever more undisguised,' the North's KCNA state news agency said. The United States and South Korea are staging military drills that North Korea says are a rehearsal for an invasion, something both Washington and Seoul deny. The North successfully launched a long-range rocket in December in violation of U.N. resolutions that banned it from developing missile or nuclear technology after nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009. The North says that it has the sovereign right to launch rockets for peaceful purposes. Its widely trailed third nuclear test was announced in response to the sanctions agreed in January, although satellite imagery indicates that the isolated and impoverished state has been readying its nuclear test site for more than a year. Defiant: North Korea successfully launched this long-range rocket in December in violation of UN resolutions that banned it from developing missile or nuclear technology after atomic tests in 2006 and 2009 . Undeterred: North Korea leader Kim Jong Un has announced that it will carry out more rocket launches and a nuclear test after it was censured by the UN Security Council over the launch of the rocket in December . While most experts believe the North will stage a test, the timing is not known. It could come around February 16, the anniversary of former leader Kim Jong-il's birth. Another unknown is what the North will use as fissile material. In the past it has used its diminishing supply of plutonium stocks, but is believed to have enriched weapons-grade uranium that would give it a second path to a nuclear bomb. U.S. nuclear expert Siegfried Hecker, who visited a North Korean nuclear facility in 2010 believes the North could stage two explosions, one using plutonium to as to perfect its capacity to design a warhead small enough to be mounted on a missile, and a second using highly enriched uranium. 'Such (dual) tests have some technical limitations and are more challenging to conduct, but they have the huge advantage of not incurring additional political cost - in other words, they can get two for the price of one,' Hecker wrote in the February 4 issue of Foreign Policy magazine. Pyongyang's two tests so far have been puny. The yield of the 2006 test is estimated at somewhat less than 1 kiloton (1,000 tons of TNT equivalent) and the second some 2-7 kilotons, compared with say 20 kilotons for a Nagasaki type bomb, Hecker wrote. Provocative: North Korea has also posted a video on YouTube showing a . simulated attack on the U.S. which includes this scene of a city . resembling New York in flames and in ruins . Wiped out: The city disappears in a huge explosion similar to a nuclear detonation . North Korea has in the past used the . leverage gained from its nuclear and rocket tests to try to restart . six-party talks aimed at securing international recognition and aid for . the country whose only major diplomatic backer is China. There . are few signs that the United States is willing to talk after the North . rebuffed a food aid deal in March 2012 when it launched a long-range . rocket after promising not to. The threat of 'stronger' measures came after North Korea posted a chilling video depicting a U.S. city engulfed in flames after an apparent missile attack. The footage, uploaded on YouTube by the North's official website, Uriminzokkiri, shows a city -- shrouded in the U.S. flag -- under attack, with its skyscrapers, including what appears to be the Empire State Building, either on fire or in ruins. South Korea in turn released its own footage today of its successful satellite launch last week which was intended to strengthen its position as a technological powerhouse. The prepares to swear in new President Park Geun-hye on February 25. Park had . pledged talks and aid if the North gives up its nuclear ambitions. Meanwhile, South Korea's U.N. ambassador Kim Sook said there are 'very busy activities' taking place at North . Korea's nuclear test site 'and everybody's watching.' Kim . told a press conference that in the event of a nuclear test, he expects . the U.N. Security Council to respond with 'firm and strong measures.' New frontiers: South Korea has released video of a satellite being released into orbit after it was successfully launched last week . Exploring new territory: The country's Satellite Technology Research Centre said first contact was made at 3.27.12am on Thursday, January 31 . North Korea announced last month that it would conduct a nuclear test to protest Security Council sanctions toughened after a satellite launch in December that the U.S. and others say was a disguised test of banned missile technology. The council ordered North Korea in the sanctions resolution to refrain from a nuclear test or face 'significant action.' South Korea joined the Security Council in January and holds the rotating presidency this month. Kim said he was speaking as South Korea's ambassador, not as the council president. He said that during negotiations on the latest sanctions resolution all 15 council members - including North Korean ally China - were unified. 'They are very firm and resolute and I would expect very firm and strong measures to be taken in terms of format as well as in substance once they go ahead with such provocation' as a nuclear test, Kim said.

"A mother-of-four was crushed to death after diving in front of a runaway van as she tried to protect her three children while they walked home from school. Shabana Ahmed, 46, is said to have shielded three of her daughters and taken the force of the collision outside the Madina Academy in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, at 3.30pm on Friday. She was pronounced dead at the scene and her 10-year-old daughter Kiran also suffered serious injuries in the accident, while Mariam, five, was hurt and sister Maria, eight, escaped uninjured. Tragedy: Shabana Ahmed, 46, is said to have shielded three of her daughters and taken the force of the collision outside the Madina Academy (left, in church) in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, at 3.30pm last Friday . Scene: It is believed the handbrake failed and the van - said to be owned by an electrician - rolled 30 yards backwards down the hill, hitting Mrs Ahmed and her children near the Chipbox fish and chip shop (left) Mrs Ahmed, who also has a daughter in her 20s, was hit by a Ford Transit Connect van which was believed to have been parked for some time on a steep road outside the academy facing uphill. It is believed the handbrake failed and the van - said to be owned by an electrician - rolled 30 yards backwards down the hill, hitting Mrs Ahmed and her children near the Chipbox fish and chip shop. Witnesses said Mrs Ahmed only saw the van at the last second and appeared to shield her girls, taking the full force of the blow herself. She lived only a short distance away with her husband. It is thought she had just collected her children from Eastborough Junior Infant and Nursery School and was going home to make tea. A local worker called it a ‘terrible tragedy and a freak accident’. Flowers: Tributes were left to Mrs Ahmed, who was described as a 'bubbly, friendly lady who loved her kids' Remembered: This note left at the scene in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, described a 'sad and tragic loss' The unnamed man said: ‘You couldn't re-create what happened if you tried. Shabana was a bubbly, friendly lady who loved her kids. We are all in shock and even grown men were in tears.’ The sound of the impact brought neighbours and passers-by running to help. Two builders working on the house next to Mrs Ahmed’s sprinted down the road and an off-duty nurse gave first aid. Paramedics and doctors were called to the scene but Mrs Ahmed had suffered fatal internal injuries. The local worker said: ‘Shabana was just . rushing back from school to cook the builders next door some tea. That's the kind of person she was. She wouldn't have heard the van . coming but saw it at the last second and shielded her kids. She probably . saved their lives.’ Location: Paramedics and doctors were called to the scene but Mrs Ahmed had suffered fatal internal injuries . It's believed the builders pulled the . van away. The man said: ‘I don't know where they got the strength from. The little girl who wasn't injured clung onto one of the builders for . two hours. It was awful.’ 'She was really popular around here and I really feel for her husband. I have told him whatever he needs there are people round here to help. It's such a tragedy' Chris Cain, 32, neighbour . Flowers and cards were placed at the spot where she died. One read: ‘I will never forget you. You are always in my heart.’ Another said: ‘Life is so cruel and yesterday you were taken so unfairly.’ Neighbour, father-of-one Chris Cain, 32, who lives with partner Lyndsey, 27, said: ‘They were always such a happy family and Shabana was a really generous person. She would always bring food round. ‘She was really popular around here and I really feel for her husband. I have told him whatever he needs there are people round here to help.

'If the school community is in favour of it then I've got no problem if it's done properly,' Dr Donnelly told shocked host Justin Smith on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Co-chair of the government's school curriculum review, Dr Kevin Donnelly, said he would back corporal punishment if the school community was behind it . A senior researcher at the Australian Catholic University with nearly two decades of teaching experience behind him, Dr Donnelly is co-chair to the national curriculum review. He appeared on the show to respond to a Fairfax report which stated the number of students being suspended and expelled from public schools has skyrocketed in the past year. However when Mr Smith posed a question about the most effective form of punishment past or present, and made it clear he was not alluding to physical punishment such as the strap saying 'You'd never advocate bringing that back surely?', Dr Donnelly paused and chuckled before he started his answer with a hesitant 'Well...'. He referenced his own experiences at school, recalling a teacher who would most likely lose his job in this day and age, but described his punishment methods as very effective. He told of his own school experience and described the method as very effective in an interview with 2UE . Although Dr Donnelly followed up the comment saying the time has passed for corporal punishment, he reinforced his point saying if the school community is behind the idea then he would take no issue with it. He contrasted the idea with 'time out' zones which he claimed are ineffective, as they give students an easy way to get out of class and away from their schoolwork. This is not the first time Dr Donnelly has been in the spotlight for controversial comments. Dr Donnelly and Kenneth Wiltshire will hand their report to the Abbott government at the end of July . He has previously expressed his concern with gay, lesbian or transgender individuals teaching sex education in schools, and in 2011 wrote an article claiming 'Multiculturalism is based on the mistaken belief that all cultures are of equal worth'. Kenneth Wiltshire is the other co-chair of the review, and the pair were appointed by education minister Christopher Pyne in January of this year. They will hand down their final report to the Abbott Government at the end of July. Liberal Democrat David Leyonhjelm is open to the concept. 'Schools should be free to manage their own affairs,' he told reporters in Canberra on Wednesday.'I don't like the fact that there's a big government bureaucracy telling them how to run their business.' Senator Leyonhjelm believes the government should set the rules for minimum outcomes, oversee national academic testing but then step back and let schools get on with the job. Labor frontbencher Tony Burke is worried about where Mr Donnelly is heading with his review.'If it's a hint of where the review's going then we have an education proposal on the way that's looking backwards rather than forwards,' he said. The Greens want Mr Donnelly sacked from the curriculum review panel, saying his views belong to another century. 'The cane or the belt should not be brought back into our classrooms,' Greens senator Penny Wright said. Independent senator Nick Xenophon believes Mr Donnelly should confine his remarks to those areas where he was best qualified, such as literacy and numeracy skills. 'He should leave corporal punishment alone,' he said. The use of corporal punishment in schools was phased out by some states from the 1980s. An Australian Institute of Family Studies research paper found corporal punishment sometimes resulted in anti-social behaviour and poor academic achievement.","Dr Kevin Donnelly told 2UE radio he would support corporal punishment in schools .

"Channel 4 News has apologised after airing a clip of Robin Williams in the film Good Morning Vietnam saying 'Get a rope and hang me' in its coverage of the actor's death. The programme broadcast a report about the 63-year-old'd death last night after he was found dead yesterday at his California home.

Channel 4 News apologised for using a clip from the film in a report where his character says: 'Get a rope and hang me' The Channel 4 report included a clip from the 1987 film where Williams played an unorthodox DJ on US Armed Services Radio in Vietnam. But the use of the quote was widely criticised on Twitter. Voiceover artist Trish Bertram said: 'Slightly unfortunate choice of Robin William's Good Morning Vietnam clip by Channel 4 News for their closing tribute.' While @Sophie 1983 tweeted: 'Did @Channel4News really use a clip from #GoodMorningVietnam where Robin Williams says ""why don't they just get a rope and hang me"" ?!?!?!?'

A spokesman said: 'We'd like to apologise for including what was an inappropriate line from Good Morning Vietnam in our play-out from tonight's programme. 'There was no offence intended in what was meant to be a heartfelt tribute to Robin Williams.' It comes after Channel Seven in Australia came under fire for broadcasting a Family Guy episode featuring jokes about Robin Williams hours after it was revealed the actor had been found dead. Digital channel 7Mate broadcast the ‘Big Man on Hippocampus’ episode some 14 hours after news broke that the Good Will Hunting actor had died, Mumbrella reported.

Another Family Guy episode titled 'Viewer Mail #2' was also broadcast by the BBC which featured Williams - and suicide - just as news broke about his death. But a BBC spokesman said: 'This was a repeat that we have shown a couple of times before, so who could have planned that?' ‘It was scheduled more than two weeks ago so it is just an uncanny coincidence. Some of our people who work here noticed that the death of Robin Williams was announced just as this episode ended. ‘It was due to be repeated on Friday but we will not be showing it now.’ Viewer Mail #2 is from season ten of the popular comedy, which looks at the life of an American family and is regularly shown on BBC Three.

"A small town in North Yorkshire, England, has gained notoriety in Asia after Taiwanese pop star, Jay Chou, held his wedding at Selby's 1,000-year-old abbey. For his marriage to model Hannah Quinlivan, the star opted for Selby Abbey for the ceremony and the nearby home of Castle Howard for the reception. Though he may be relatively unknown in Britain, Chou is one of the biggest stars that Taiwan has ever produced, even being nicknamed the 'New King of Asian Pop.' Selby in North Yorkshire has gained considerably notoriety in Asia following Jay Chou's wedding . The Taiwanese popstar married his girlfriend earlier this month at the 1,000-year-old Selby Abbey . Since announcing his marriage last week, both venues have already been visited by hundreds of fans, inspiring tour operators to add the locations to their itineraries. In fact, Castle Howard is now translating its wedding brochure to respond to enquiries from Asia. 'We have also seen an increase in enquiries from Chinese outbound-tour operators, so hope to see an increase in groups visiting us over the summer and during our Christmas opening,' Hannah Cooke, a spokeswoman for Castle Howard, said. The couple's luxurious reception was held at the nearby Castle Howard, a 4,050-hectare estate . Following news of their wedding venue hitting the media, the abbey and castle have seen many tourists . The 36-year-old singer, actor and director, unsurprisingly, chose a regal theme for his grand fairytale affair. His 21-year-old bride, whose Chinese name is Wu Yi-Chen, wore a white Tudor-inspired gown and a diamond-encrusted tiara worth over £1.25 million. Weddings at the 4,050-hectare estate start at £8,000 with a rental of the main house coming in at about £15,000. At Castle Howard, the team have also experienced an increase in enquiries about it as a wedding venue . Most of the fans who have visited over the past week are Asian visitors already studying overseas in Britain, according to the abbey's vicar. Unlike York, Selby Abbey had not previously received many visitors from Asia, but this is expected to change following the recent festivities. Chou, who is often credited with reviving the Mandarin music scene, is known for his blend of traditional Chinese instrument sounds and hip hop and R&B. Chou and his bride, Hannah Quinlivan, opted for an appropriately royal theme for their fairytale day . Recently, he also directed and starred in 2007's Secret and acted as Kato in The Green Hornet, alongside Seth Rogen. Chou's wedding also comes on the heels of the UK trialling easing up on visa application requirements for Chinese citizens. Destination weddings are also growing in popularity among mainland Chinese couples, the South China Morning Post reports.","North Yorkshire gains international notoriety after Jay Chou's wedding .

"Internet service providers  did not raise the alarm about extreme messages posted by one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby in the six months before his death, it has been revealed. The companies - who have come under intense pressure to do more to help police and the security services - failed to inform authorities about material posted by Michael Adebolajo before the attack he carried out with Michael Adebowale. It meant MI5 missed internet messages that could have alerted them to the threat posed by the murderers. Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right) were sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Lee Rigby. In the months before the attack, Adebolajo had been posting extremist material on social media . A long-awaited report by Parliament’s intelligence watchdog is expected to say Adebolajo was posting extremist material on social media sites in the months leading up to the attack. The messages would have been sufficiently serious to justify the security services – who had had Adebolajo on their radar for eight years – putting him under more detailed surveillance. But officers found out about them only after the sickening murder of the 25-year-old soldier outside Woolwich Barracks in May last year. The Intelligence and Security Committee report is also expected to highlight a failed attempt by MI5 to recruit Adebolajo as a source – but, crucially, it will say that officials could not have prevented the attack on the day. The findings, due to be made public by the end of this month, come at a time of heightened concern about use of the internet and social media by would-be terrorists. Earlier this month, the head of GCHQ accused firms such as Twitter and Facebook of turning into ‘the command and control networks of choice’ for terrorists. Fusilier Lee Rigby was killed in Woolwich after crossing the road near his barracks . Robert Hannigan said some US-based tech firms were in denial about the misuse of their services by fanatics who could use them to facilitate mass murder. The ISC report is expected to say that Adebolajo had been known to MI5 for eight years. He was a regular member of a small group of fanatics closely linked to the extremist preacher Anjem Choudary. He was also pictured in violent scenes during a protest outside the Old Bailey in 2006 and spent three months in prison in 2008 for assault. The key incident came when he was stopped in Kenya where he had been caught trying to join the al-Shabaab terrorist group. He appeared in court in Kenya but was not charged and returned home. His then-lawyer claimed he was freed on the recommendation of the British High Commission and avoided a formal deportation. Adebolajo told the Old Bailey there was ‘more to the story’. The report is expected to say the security services tried to recruit him as an informant but he rejected their approaches. Officials argue that trying to recruit terror suspects and extremists is a vital part of MI5’s work and that not every attempt will succeed. They also point out that, with several thousand Islamists on MI5’s radar, they are forced to prioritise on the basis of available intelligence. In a speech last year, director general Andrew Parker said it was impossible to stop all terrorist attacks. The evidence against Adebolajo would have been enough for security services to justify more surveillance. The murder of Lee Rigby shocked the nation. A little boy places flowers near the site of his death in May 2013 . He added: ‘Knowing of an individual does not equate to knowing everything about them. ‘Being on our radar does not necessarily mean being under our microscope. The reality of intelligence work is that we only focus the most intense intrusive attention on a small number of cases at any one time.’ Adebolajo, 29, was sentenced to a whole-life term earlier this year. Adebowale, 23, was jailed for a minimum of 45 years. It was the first successful terrorist attack on British soil since the July 7 suicide bombings on the London transport system.","Internet service providers did not raise alarm over extremist posts .

"In a sickening video posted on YouTube, soldiers from the Syrian-based group Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) were seen holding up the decapitated head of a soldier they believed was a supporter of President Bashar al-Assad. But, after the footage was made public, the victim was recognised by an extremist as a fellow rebel fighter who had been wounded during a battle. The militants have now asked . for forgiveness. Sickening: Soldiers then held the severed head up in front of a crowd in Aleppo . Error: Mohammed Fares, left, who was mistakenly decapitated by Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham militants . After an investigation the soldier was identified as Mohammed Fares, a commander of Ahrar al-Sham, a group who fight alongside the ISIS. The Syrian Observatory of Human Rights said ISIS fighters misunderstood comments Mr Fares made about the founding fathers of Shia Islam, Imams Ali and Hussein, according to The Daily Telegraph. It is thought Mr Fares was injured while fighting pro-Assad forces for the control of military site Base 80 near Aleppo, before he was mistakenly executed. The militant group tried to explain their error by referring to a story in which the prophet Mohammed said Allah would forgive a man who killed a believer by mistake. An ISIS spokesman, Oma al-Qahtani, confirmed Mr fares had been injured in fighting and had been captured by soldiers who believed he was fighting against them. He has now said an investigation into the death would be carried out by the appropriate authorities. The huge mistake has highlighted chaos within the rebel ranks in Syria, which Assad has taken advantage of in recent weeks during a push by his forces south-east of Aleppo.

Honesty: MPs will learn the difference between right and wrong in seminars modelled on those given to lawyers . Lord Bew, the chairman of the . committee on standards in public life, said the seminars would raise . ‘the awareness of practical ethical issues among MPs’. Lessons . on how to accept gifts and contact with outside lobbyists would raise . the ‘ethical sensitivity of members of parliament’, according to Lord . Bew. ‘People are thrust into situations they don’t expect and they are . not necessarily equipped to know how to behave,’ he said. ‘There . are sometimes simple cases of corruption, but a lot of what is going on . now is a little bit more complicated to work out what is right and what . is wrong.’ Change: New chairman of the standards watchdog Lord Bew said gut instinct is not enough any more .

"Disney has unveiled electronic wristbands that store . information and allow its theme parks to track visitors. Magic Bands, as they are playfully called, completely do . away with paper tickets, room keys and even credit cards through the use of . microchips. They also transmit personal information to sensor-wearing . mascots, log visitor buying habits and even tailor rides to the people on them, . according to the Broward-Palm Beach New Times. It's magic!: Just wave the wristbands at sensors deployed around theme parks and you're let onto rides, can pay for food and even enter your hotel room . The waterproof rubber wristbands use RF . technology – a low frequency radio transmission currently used for things like . transit cards and some tap to pay technologies. RF technology only works at close distances. MagicBands replace theme park entry tickets and FastPasses, hotel . room keys and credit cards. They send names and birthdates to mascots – leading to them possibly . greeting children by name. ‘Hi, Bobby! Happy Birthday!’ As the New Times put it. People waiting on line for certain rides will have . entertainment and information fed to them on video screens based on observed . spending and park migration habits. The theme park manages the monitoring of guests using the MyMagic+ . ‘vacation management system,’ according to the New Times. The danger within: The wristbands use RFID technology, which techies posting to Disney forums worry can be cracked by even a cell phone . Happy birthday!: The data on the wristbands can also be used to tell mascots park visitors' names and birthdays, allowing them to provide personalized greetings . A consumer version of the platform is made available to . vacationers to manage the information added to the wristbands including park . passes, dining credits and even PhotoPasses. Information is input using an app available in either of the . popular mobile app markets. The MagicBands are currently in a limited beta testing . phase, according to Disney, but are expected to be made available to all theme . park guests. Despite growing outrage over NSA spying and the increasing . lack of privacy on Facebook and other social media sites, vacationers can’t . wait to slap them on, according to comments on a well-read review of the . bracelets. The review posted to Disney fan site MouseChat suggests the . only major problem with the bands, which can be adorned with charms depicting a . multitude of popular Disney characters, is their functionality. No mention of privacy issues is made anywhere in the write-up. They also track you: Park officials can also use the wristbands to track movements and chart spending habits . Tech buffs posting to one of many Disney theme park-related . forums expressed concerns that cell phones could access and possibly clone the . information stored on the bands. Much of the criticism was leveled at Disney’s choice of ‘easily . readable’ RF technology over the more secure Near Field Communications (NFC) standard. Purchases made using the bands would require the use of a . PIN code, but only if they exceed $50, according to a previous New York Times . report. The MagicBands review noted that it was nearly impossible to . get those PIN codes to work. A Disney spokesperson also told the Times that no personal . information will be stored on the wristbands.

"Uncontrollable: The Internet Watch Foundation warned that once an explicit image is posted online it can be impossible to fully remove . Tens of thousands of explicit self-portraits taken by teenagers are ending up on websites viewed by paedophiles. The naked or sexual pictures are often taken by girls at the request of boys in their classes and sent by mobile phone, in a practice known as ‘sexting’. But unbeknown to the girls, these photographs may end up being passed around the school and even shared on social networking sites such as Facebook – then stolen and published on websites used by paedophiles. An earlier investigation found boys and girls as young as 13 are routinely swapping naked self-portraits. Now watchdog the Internet Watch Foundation has warned that many of these pictures are ending up online. Susie Hargreaves, chief executive of the charity, said ‘self-generated’ pictures of children are now a major source of images used on websites viewed by paedophiles. In a search lasting just 40 hours, one of her analysts found 12,224  self-generated images of teenagers on 70 paedophilic websites. Given the speed of the investigation, the true number of stolen pictures is likely to be far higher. At a fringe event at the Conservative Party conference, Miss Hargreaves said she would like to see children taught about the dangers of sexting at school, so they understand that they might never be able to remove every copy of a picture or video that ends up online. ‘From our perspective, the younger people know about the risks, the better for us,’ she said, adding: ‘Take the issue of sexting – we don’t like the word, but we did a small piece of research last year. ‘One analyst spent 40 hours – that’s all, 40 hours – and every time they came across a self-generated image which had been stolen and put on a paedophilic website, they counted it. In 40 hours they found 12,200 self-generated images. ‘These are images one teenager had taken of themselves or another teenager shared, which had probably gone around the school and somewhere along the process had been stolen, uploaded and that’s it.’ Miss Hargreaves also warned that older teenagers could themselves be in contravention of child abuse laws if they send or receive naked pictures – because the law says any such pictures of children under 18 can constitute abuse. She said: ‘One of the things that older young people are not aware is that if you’re 16 or 17 you might think you are over the age of consent, but if you take an image it’s still child sexual abuse because it’s an image of someone under 18. There are so many risks they’re not aware of.’ Children told the IWF that sexting is now considered ‘mundane and mainstream’. One . girl said she was asked for naked pictures ‘at least two or three times . a week’. Another said: ‘One explicit image I took … is coming up on the . first page of [search engines], which could jeopardise any future . career I have or if any family or friends come across it.’ Emma McClarkin, a Tory MEP for the . East Midlands, said: ‘If your daughter allows one picture of herself to . get shared by a friend to a friend who then lets it go on, that picture . can get stolen on so many multiple sites that it’s impossible to ever . get it off.’ Danger: A third of people who sent 'sexts' said they went to people they had met only online, while 15 per cent had sent images to total strangers (posed by model) NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said: ‘These images are illegal, as they effectively constitute indecent images of children, and it’s now becoming clear that adult sex offenders are getting hold of them. ‘We urge all parents to discuss the risks with their children.’ The Daily Mail has been campaigning for an automatic block on online porn to protect children. Over-18s would be able to see adult images only if they ‘opt-in’ after going through stringent age verification.","Internet Watch Foundation warned how many explicit images are uploaded .

"Occupy Wall Street protesters have begun to squabble over money with some demanding a reported $500,000 the movement has in its bank be shared more equally. And with the cold weather beginning to take a firm grip on New York City, doubts have been raised as to whether the anti-corporation demonstration can make it through the winter. It has also emerged that Zuccotti Park, the focus of the protest since it begun on September 17, is providing an alluring home for vagrants, at the same time as those within the movement cautioned against spreading the demonstration too thinly. The beat goes on: Paxton Gearity, age four from Ossining, New York joins demonstrators with Occupy Wall Street continue their protest at Zuccotti Park in New York today . Protesters of all ages: Malka, age 5, joined demonstrations today . If you need some, take some: Protesters are falling out over the allotment of nearly $500,000 worth of donations . Ironic? News of a fallout over money seems to run in contrast with the anti-corporation ethos of the Occupy Wall Street movement . Bedding down: The increasingly cold winter weather is also a cause for concern for protesters, who are not allowed to erect tents . Yet given Occupy Wall Street's (OWS) anti-establishment ethos, the main worry for the hundreds camped out in New York's financial district will be the battle over money. Donations are pouring in, but gripes over how that money is spent is threatening to split the protesters apart. A Finance Committee has been set up to deal with cashflow, and assign it to working collectives with the movement so essential items can be bought. But those denied funds are getting angry. For example, a set of drums was vandalised one night last week, however the Finance Committee has refused a request for $8,000 to replace them. 'F**k Finance. I hope Mayor Bloomberg gets an injunction and demands to see the movement’s books,' Bryan Smith, a 45-year-old protester who joined OWS from Los Angeles three weeks ago told the New York Post. 'We need to know how much money we really have and where it’s going.' Mr Smith, who works in TV production, is a member of the Comfort Working Group, which is charged with finding out what basic necessities campers need, such as thermal underwear, and then raising money by asking for donations on the street, the New York Post reported. Working groups: A number of groups have been set up with defined purposes, but some are getting annoyed at requests for money being turned down . Tents please: A petition is underway to push for tents to be allowed at Zuccotti Park, but Mayor Bloomberg is resistant to relaxing the laws. Tarpaulin sheets must make do instead . Advice: On-site nurses are telling people to stay wrapped up and dry, words which this little pooch has heeded . 'The other day, I took in $2,000. I kept $650 for my group, and gave the rest to Finance, he told the paper. 'Then I went to them with a request - so many people need things, and they should not be going without basic comfort items - and I was told to fill out paperwork. Paperwork! Are they the government now? 'We need winter gear, shoes, socks. I could spend $10,000 alone for backpacks people need. We raise all this money. Where is it?' One rainy night last week, someone stabbed holes in many of the protesters' drums with a knife, Elijah Moses told the New York Post. The 19-year-old, a founder of the Pulse Working Group, asked for $8,000 to replace the drums, and build a small shed to lock them up. 'They said no - they turned us down. I’m really frustrated,' he told the paper. Haven for the homeless: There are reports of vagrants moving to Zuccotti park in New York because of community feel and free food . Pete Dutro, 36, a Brooklyn tattoo artist studying a master's in finance and sits on the Finance Committee, said big purchases can't get the green light straight away. 'We don’t have the power for that. They have to go to the General Assembly. If it's approved, we pay out that amount and make sure everything is accounted for,' he told the New york Post. The funding fight emerged as a number of protesters voiced concerns over the coming freezing temperatures - as tents are forbidden. At night, the several hundred people who sleep on site in the financial district currently huddle together using plastic tarps, sleeping bags and emergency blankets. But the worst is yet to come. 'So far, we have been extremely blessed,' Cynthia Villarreal, who has slept at Zuccotti for 18 days, told AFP. Zuccotti Park has so far experienced only a handful of rainy days, while at night, temperatures are still above freezing. However New York winters often see temperatures drop below 14F (-10C) and some are beginning to worry. 'The cold affects us already,' Maria Fehlig, a volunteer nurse at the protesters' makeshift infirmary, told AFP. Soaked: Rainy nights have so far been few, but Russell Brand got caught in a shower last Wednesday, and weather is expected to worsen . She described how there had been several cases of hypothermia and respiratory problems. An online petition is asking New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to allow protesters to erect tents on the plaza, though it has not yet been sent. Its chances of success seem slim, though, with Mr Bloomberg saying earlier this week: 'The Constitution doesn't protect tents, it protects speech and assembly.' But Ms Fehlig, who has been teaching protesters basic methods for battling the cold, insisted that they formed 'a determined group that plans to stay until it changes.' She is informing demonstrators to stay dry, wear hats, layers of clothing and good pairs of socks and gloves, AFP reported. Meanwhile the New York Daily News has reported a growing number of homeless people are flocking to the site, as it provides a safe, community environment, along with free food. 'I think this is a better situation to be involved with,' 49-year-old Matthew Maloney, who was released from prison last month and spent time in a Staten Island shelter, told the New York Daily News. 'I am around a good cause and around positive people, rather than in that other environment,' Maloney, who has drifted in and out of the state prison system for more than three decades for a variety of crimes, including robbery and possession of stolen property, told the paper. Bronx couple Yvette Vigo and Orlando Nieves told the Daily News they were forced into a shelter a year ago when they could no longer afford rent. 'I feel safer out here than I did in a shelter,' Ms Vigo, 45, said. 'It's a big area with a lot of kind people.'

"The husband of a mother-of-two, who was been killed when she was apparently electrocuted by a faulty $4.99 charger, has spoken out about his heartbreak. The woman who died in her North Gosford home at 4pm on April 23 has been identified as Sheryl Aldeguer, 28, a nurse who moved to Australia from the Philippines for work. It is believed she was talking on her phone while it was plugged into the charger. Luigi Aldeguer told The Daily Telegraph his wife was speaking to a friend who was in Dubai when the incident happened. Authorities have issued a warning to consumers about knock-off USB-style chargers and are investigating distributors of the USB chargers after the woman's death. Scroll down for video . Sheryl Aldeguer, 28, was killed in April through a faulty phone charger. She is pictured here with husband Luigi . Mr Aldeguer has remembered his wife as considerate and was dedicated to her beliefs. 'She was the best mum and equally the best wife one could have,' he told The Daily Telegraph. 'Very sacrificial and the most understanding person in the world.' Mrs Aldeguer had just become an Australian citizen and was about to start work at Gosford Hospital. She hoped her husband and two young children would join her in the country soon, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Mrs Aldeguer was talking on her phone, which was plugged into a charger, when she died. The charger, which did not meet Australian safety regulations, had inadequate shielding causing 240 volts to 'arc' and pass from the charger through the phone into her body. It is believed that Mrs Aldeguer died instantly and her body, which had burns to the chest and ears, was found the following day by friends and her landlord. People have taken to Facebook to express condolences to Mr Aldeguer who lives in California. 'With all our love and our tears of sadness at losing her mixed with tears of happiness at having known her,' wrote Luis Chato Maneru the day after Mrs Aleguer died. Ella Aldeguer Favis wrote: 'Hold on to the two beautiful gifts Sheryl Aldeguer gave you. Living proof of the love and commitment you shared. Haven't stopped praying for you Luigi Aldeguer.' It is believed that the voltage arced and passed through the charger into Mrs Aldeguer's body while she was talking on the phone . Mrs Aldeguer had just become an Australian citizen and was a few days away from starting a job as a nurse at Gosford Hospital . Police closed down a stall in Campsie in Sydney's southwest last week after a friend of Mrs Aldeguer told police that the faulty charger had been bought there. Police seized a large amount of stock, including phone chargers, power boards and travel adaptors, which were found not to meet Australian safety requirements. NSW Fair Trading Commisioner Rod Stowe said the rip-off, cheap chargers seized by the commission were low quality plastic that could melt and did not have insulation on pins or approval marks. The accessory stall in Campsie faces fines of up to $87,500 and/or two years' imprisonment and Mr Stowe said it was very likely the commission would pursue prosecution. This is the only know fatality to date that seems to be connected to the devices, but Mr Stowe said the public needed to be informed immediately to avoid further deaths. 'It's a wake-up call to people who buy cheap electronic products without realising potential hazards,' said NSW Fair Trading Commissioner Rod Stowe. 'If the deal's too good to be true, it usually is and it can prove fatal.' Fair Trading Electrical Product Safety Expert Lynelle Collins said it had been five years since a similar death caused by a faulty electronic device but there was a serious risk of further deaths. 'Particularly with the Internet, people can buy stuff directly from overseas wholesalers that may not meet Australian safety standards,' she said. A large quantity of knock-off USB style chargers have been seized from a stall in Campsie after a woman was found dead with burns on her ears and chest in an apparent electrocution . The fatality is the first known death that seems to be linked to the knock-off charger devices, which do not meet Australian safety standards . Police initially suspected Mrs Aldeguer was killed by her laptop, which she was also using at the time of her death. As well as talking on the phone, Mrs Aldeguer was wearing headphones, which were plugged into her laptop. The laptop was also plugged into a charger. It is believed the voltage completed its circuit by travelling from the faulty charger into the phone, into her body, then through her headphones into her laptop and then through the computer charger back into the wall. Ms Collins said that even without the laptop the incident could have proved fatal. Police in the Brisbane Waters Local Area command are investigating the woman's death and did not want to release more information about the death. Consumers who have already bought non-approved USB-style chargers for phones or tablets are advised to bend the pins on the chargers and throw them away immediately. People are also warned not to use devices while they are charging or plugged in. Anyone with more information about the dodgy chargers should contact Fair Trading on 13 32 20. Police are warning consumers to bend the pins and throw away any rip-off USB-style charger they might have .","Sheryl Aldeguer, 28, was found dead in her home in Gosford .

"A devastated couple are begging to have their daughter's life ended because they can no longer bear to see her suffering from an incurable and painful cancer. Zhao Zihan, from north-western China's Shaanxi Province, was diagnosed two years ago with retinoblastoma . This is a rapidly developing cancer that forms in the retina of the eye. Last year, she had her left eyeball removed in an operation, but the cancer cells continued to spread and a massive, malignant tumour began growing on her cheek. Heartbroken parents Zhao Lipeng, 27 and his wife Lili, 25, are searching for a hospital that will let their daughter Zhao Zihan, four, die in peace. She was diagnosed with a terminal eye cancer two years ago . Zhao Zihan had surgery to remove a tumour from her left eyeball last year, but the cancer continued to spread. Now she has a large, malignant growth on her cheek (pictured) which leaves her in agony . Zhao Zihan as a baby. Her parents have taken her to numerous  hospitals  to see different specialists but, despite sugery, her cancer is incurable. 'We can't bear to see her like this any more,' her father said . Despite numerous consultations, hospital visits and painful medical treatment including removing her eye, doctors said her cancer was incurable. Now her parents say they can no longer bear to see her in pain. Her father Zhao Lipeng, 27, told QNews: 'We hope to find a hospital that will admit our child and help lessen her pain so that she can leave this world peacefully,' he said. 'We can't bear to see her like this any more. 'She is suffering all the time. We have taken her to every hospital and every specialist that we could, and everyone has told us it incurable. 'There is no hope.' They have taken their daughter to hospitals including Beijing's Tongren Hospital, which specialises in ophthalmology. Retinoblastoma - cancer of the retina - is a rare type of eye cancer which usually affects children younger than five. The disease causes the retina cells to grow quickly and out-of-control. While treating it usually involves laser treatment, freezing the tumour or heat therapy,. Larger tumours can require chemotherapy, or surgery to remove the eye. Some of the symptoms include: . * A white eye or white reflection which can be seen in a photograph . * A squint . * A red sore or swollen eye . * A change in colour to the iris . * Deterioration in vision . It was there that doctors confirmed her condition was incurable and would be terminal. Retinoblastoma – cancer of the retina – causes the cells of the retina to grow rapidly and out of control. It is the most common reason for eye tumours found in children, and the number of cases seen in Asia has grown since 1987. If the cancer has spread beyond the eye, as in Zhao Zihan's case, it has the potential to spread around the body and is difficult to treat. Survival is dependent on early diagnosis - and for Zhao Zihan, the diagnosis came too late. Her father says although it will break his heart to see her die, he cannot watch his daughter suffer any longer. Euthanasia is illegal under current Chinese law, although recent surveys have shown a majority of people have a tolerant attitude towards the practice, the Shanghaiist reports. 'We want her to leave this life peacefully, not in agony,' her mother said. Zhao Zihan, with her mother, is left in pain by the huge tumour on her cheek. Her parents say they hope to find a hospital that will admit her and help lessen her pain so that she can die peacefully .","Zhao Zihan, 4, was diagnosed with retinoblastoma two years ago .

"Confirmation: The human remains found under a car park in Leicester are expected to be confirmed as belonging to Richard III . A skeleton thought to be Richard III, discovered underneath a car park in Leicester, was found after a women had a hunch that he was buried there. Screenwriter Philippa Langley said she felt a chill on a hot summer's day as she walked through the area where it was thought he was buried. The remarkable discovery of the remains, entailing a curved spine back and wounded skull, was made last September. The skeleton is expected to be confirmed as that of Richard III - one of England's most controversial kings. Miss Langley was strolling across the car park used by Leicester social services while researching a play about the king when she felt a chill in August 2009. According to The Sunday Times, she said: 'It was a hot summer and I had goosebumps so badly and I was freezing cold. I walked past a particular spot and absolutely knew I was walking on his grave. 'I am a rational human being but the feeling I got was the same feeling I have had before when a truth is given to me.' Miss Langley initially funded . the excavation of what is now a Leicester City Council car park because she was '99 per cent certain' that the remains were those of Richard. Since then scientists have been conducting a range of tests to establish whether the remains do indeed belong to the Plantagenet King. Researchers from Leicester University will hold a press conference on Monday morning where they will present the findings of their investigation. The scientists will present the results of carbon-dating tests and a DNA investigation, pairing the skeleton's genetic material with that of Michael Ibsen. Scroll down for video . Felt a chill: Screenwriter Philippa Langley said she 'absolutely knew' Richard III was buried in a car park in Leicester when she felt goosebumps on a hot summer's day . Mr Ibsen, a London-based furniture-maker, is a direct descendant of the medieval king's sister, Anne of York. Reports suggest that the scientists will also confirm the body was not buried within a coffin or shroud. Richard . III died during the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, becoming the last . English king to die on the battlefield, and is thought to have been . crudely buried by his successor Henry VII. The body in the car park has an arrow in its back, matching details of his death in the battle. The skeleton's scoliosis – severe curvature of the spine – ties in with the . famous description by Shakespeare and others of the monarch as a . hunchback. Findings: This image shows the dig in progress. Scientists have conducted carbon-dating on the remains, as well as DNA testing . Discovery: The human remains were uncovered in September in what is now the car park of Leicester City Council's social services department, pictured . However, those working on the project previously said these details were not enough to prove that the skeleton was Richard. Miss Langley is working on a documentary charting the excavation for Channel 4 titled Richard III: . The King in the Car Park, which has been made alongside the university . academics and will be screened on Monday night following the press . conference. Previous reports suggested that . academics withheld evidence during press conferences to . generate publicity for the documentary, much to the annoyance of some . involved in the project. Final resting place: The remains found here (circled) were discovered after screenwriter Philippa Langley felt a chill on a hot summer's day as she walked through the car park. She said she 'absolutely knew' that he was buried there . War wounds: Karen Ladniuk from the Richard III society at the excavation site where the body was found with an arrow in its back, matching details of Richard's death in the battle . Langley, who is a member of the Richard III Society, said a play that she began . researching three years ago has been turned into a script for television . and film. She told the Sunday Times the scripts are now 'getting serious interest from Los Angeles and in the UK'. The new evidence will also include tartar analysis from the skeleton's teeth. Once it is confirmed that the body is . Richard III, it is believed the remains will be buried inside Leicester . Cathedral - more than 500 years after he was killed in battle. The . decision, made by the Ministry of Justice, came after a row between MPs . as to where Richard should . be laid to rest. Some said he should be given a state burial in Westminster Abbey because he was a reigning monarch. Others said the remains should be buried in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, the centre of the Plantagenet monarch’s kingdom. But in a parliamentary answer, the Government settled for Leicester Cathedral, a stone’s throw from the car park. Jon Ashworth, Labour MP for Leicester . South, said at the time: ‘This is really good news.

"Banned: David Duckworth cannot keep dogs for 10 years after performing DIY surgery on his lurcher . An unemployed dog owner performed DIY surgery on his own pet without using any anaesthetic - and then bragged about the cruel act on Facebook. David Duckworth, 23, gave his pet lurcher Tess penicillin - believing it was a painkiller - before giving her 15 stitches in her chest. He claimed on Facebook that she had been 'good as gold', but shocked people who saw the post complained to the RSPCA. Duckworth has been banned from keeping dogs for 10 years. The sentence, handed out by magistrates at Burnley Crown Court, was originally two years, but was increased when he appealed. When inspectors told him that penicillin is an antibiotic and not a painkiller, he responded that they were the same thing, adding: 'You take them for headaches'. Tess had cut her chest on barbed wire, and the court also heard how Duckworth did not take another of his dogs - a tan lurcher named Cleo - to the vets when she suffered a wound on her leg. He had again treated the dog, which was found in a house in Blackburn, by himself. The court rejected Duckworth's claims that Tess was not his dog, and that he had been looking after her for a friend who he would not name. He called the dog 'my lass' in his Facebook post. He also claimed that the penicillin was not his, that he did not inject it, and that the photos were 'just bragging', the Lancashire Telegraph reports. 'I was just being stupid. People on Facebook were telling me it was mental,' he said. Duckworth, from Eton Close in Padiham, Lancashire, said he used Cleo and another dog, named Honey, for catching rats and rabbits. Warning - graphic content below . Cruel: Duckworth gave one dog, Tess, 15 stitches in her chest, and left another, Cleo, with a wound on her leg . He had posted pictures on Facebook of the dogs beside dead deer and foxes, suggesting that he illegally used them for hunting. Duckworth claimed that these dead animals were roadkill. Judge Beverley Lunt said the bench was satisfied Tess was Duckworth's dog, and that he had treated her himself to conceal how she had suffered her injury. 'Plainly, the reason he wouldn't take it to the vet was because questions would be asked about how the dog had received such a significant injury on barbed wire,' she said. Duckworth admitted to performing DIY surgery on Tess and failing to take reasonable steps to protect Cleo from pain, suffering and disease. Wounded: Judge Beverley Lunt said Duckworth showed a disregard for the welfare of his animals . Magistrates fined him £110, with £100 costs and £20 victim surcharge, ordered that Cleo be removed from his care and banned him from keeping dogs for two years. He appealed, but had the ban increased to 10 years, with Judge Lunt saying he had shown disregard for his pets' welfare and that animals needed to be protected from him. 'Any reasonable dog owner who had its welfare at heart would have taken it to a vet and any vet would have prescribed pain medication. We are satisfied it's more his luck than judgement that the wound did not become infected,' she added. Cleo has been in kennels since she was taken from Duckworth in November, and could now be given a new home by the RSPCA. Nicholas Clarke, who works for the charity, told of how inspectors went to Duckworth's house on November 17 last year after receiving reports that he had been seen stitching up a dog. He told them that he had performed surgery on his pets a number of times, adding: 'I'm more qualified than most vets.' A separate visit on November 29 found Duckworth not to be home, but did discover Cleo with a four centimetre long gash on her right hind leg. She was taken into RSPCA care and treated by a vet. Sobia Ahmed, the defence lawyer, told the court her client said Cleo had run into a fence post, and he cleaned, sealed and dressed her wound, but did admit he should have taken her to the vets.","Unemployed David Duckworth, 23,  banned from keeping dogs for 10 years .

"Tony Blair says he believes regime change in Iran and Syria is essential for global security . Tony Blair has said that he believes regime change in Iran is necessary and there needs to be military intervention if it acquires nuclear weapons capability. While Al Qaeda poses a significant threat to people across the world he believes the bigger evil is Iran which 'support groups that are engaged with terrorism and the forces of reaction'. Speaking ahead of the tenth anniversary of 9/11 the Prime Minister said that for the sake of international security, President Ahmadinejad must be ousted from power. 'If Iran were to acquire nuclear weapons . capability it would destabilise the region very, very badly. 'If . they were to do that - even now in Iraq they're still interfering where . they can and as much as they can. I think regime change in Tehran would . immediately make me significantly more optimistic about the whole of . the region,' he told The Times. Mr Blair, who is now peace envoy for the Middle East, blames Iran for the lengths of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts - wars that he led the UK into alongside America. In January, Blair told the Chilcot inquiry that force might be necessary to deal with the treat from Iran and he still stands by that view. 'Yes. The threat Iran poses to the stability of the region is immense,' he said. Answering criticisms that people in Iraq and Afghanistan, although oppressed, had stability he said that before terrorism is defeated dictatorships have to be toppled. The former PM believes that Iranian President Ahmadinejad (left) and Syria's President Bashar Assad have to let go of power for there to be global security . Blair was in Brighton preparing to give a speech to the Trade Union Congress when the planes flew into the Twin Towers in New York . Turning to the situation in Syria and the Arab Spring he said that the revolutions had shown that there is a thirst for democracy and freedom. He said that President Bashar Assad has shown he cannot take Syria through the process of change and must give up power and is unable to invoke reforms. Mr Blair stopped short of suggesting Libya-style military intervention in the country but implored the international community to 'do everything it can now to hasten that'. He said: 'His position is untenable. I was saying even two or three months ago, if he genuinely showed that he was prepared to lead a process of reform, then I would give him the chance to make the evolution work.' However, he adds that it will be difficult for Assad to start making political reform towards democracy as he knows that at the end of the process he would not be elected as president. Blair in Brighton where he heard about the attacks. He went straight back to London and he said he knew straightaway that the attacks would change the politics of global security . If Tony Blair's mission against terrorism was not started by the events of 9/11, then it was at least heightened. He was in Brighton preparing to give a speech to the Trade Union Congress when the planes flew into the Twin Towers in New York. He went straight back to London and he said he knew from the beginning that it would change the politics of global security. Now he admits that the task was even bigger than he initially believed it to be in the days after the attacks against the U.S. but continues to believe that the battle can be won through his 'hearts and minds' mantra. He concludes by saying 'I believe we will win [global freedom and democracy] but it's going to take time.","The former PM says the Arab Spring shows there is a thirst for democracy and freedom .

Tiquie the Brazilian Tapir loving her pampering sessions at Taronga Zoo this week. Tapirs are typically shy in the wild but Zoo keepers say Tiquie soaks up the attention, often smiling and closing her eyes during her daily massages . But Tiquie is no stranger to being primped and preened. Although Tapirs are normally solitary, elusive creatures in the wild, keeper Nat Dunn says Tiquie loves the interaction of her daily grooming sessions. 'She’ll close her eyes and tilt her head back when we’re rubbing the oil onto her skin and often roll onto her back for a tummy tickle,” said Dunn. “We also brush her hair and skin to bring out its natural oils and because of her relaxed nature; we’re able to perform a hands-on health check of her feet, ears, eyes and body.' Keepers at Taronga Zoo brush Tiquie's wiry mane everyday to keep it healthy . Tapirs have survived for millions of years but their future in the wild is under threat due to extensive hunting,  logging and clearing of their jungle and forest habitats for agriculture.

"Usually when a player is deemed surplus to requirements by a manager, he is allowed to leave for a more humble sum than might have been imagined. Think Eric Cantona’s £1.5million fee to Manchester United after falling out with Howard Wilkinson at Leeds, the £10m price Sunderland paid Manchester City for misfit Adam Johnson, or the cost to Liverpool of £12m for Chelsea’s Daniel Sturridge, who is now worth at least twice as much. Record buy: Romelu Lukaku completed his £28m move to Everton from Chelsea . But Jose . Mourinho bucks that trend. The Chelsea boss is somehow able to extract . huge sums for players he does not even want. Since he returned to . Stamford Bridge, five players he thought unworthy of keeping have been . offloaded for quite remarkable figures totalling £141m. Kevin De Bruyne started just two Premier League games for Chelsea following a £6.7m move from Genk, but was sold in January to Wolfsburg for a staggering £18m. Manchester United broke their transfer record to sign Juan Mata that same month for £37m. He had only started 11 league games under Mourinho, one Champions League tie and two matches in the Capital One Cup. Unwanted: Both Lukaku and Ba were deemed surplus to requirements at Chelsea . Demba Ba moved to Besiktas for £8m this summer – a profit of £1m from the fee paid to Newcastle – despite being 29 years old and with only 23 starts in all competitions in 18 months. In June Paris Saint-Germain handed over an astonishing £50m for David Luiz, a player Mourinho had reservations about from day one and was behind John Terry and Gary Cahill in the pecking order for centre-backs. It is a world-record fee for a defender. And now Everton have set a new transfer record fee in capturing Romelu Lukaku for £28m. Fresh start: Demba Ba moved to Turkish club Basiktas for £8m this summer . Across the five deals Chelsea made a total profit in the region of £60m. A phenomenal amount even for Chelsea - because Financial Fair Play rules should begin to bite and the fact these were players no longer desired. Quite how the club, and Mourinho as its architect, have been able to pull it all off is a question many of the game’s executives would like to know. Case by case, each transfer fee has its merits for the buying club for different reasons, and Chelsea have clearly been able to push the right buttons to get the most money possible. Special Juan: Spanish midfielder Juan Mata moved to Manchester United in January . De Bruyne is a young, dynamic attacker who can flourish in the technical Bundesliga and become a flag-bearer for Wolfsburg, where he has scored three goals in 16 games since January. For Werder Bremen the previous season he was marvellous, scoring 10 goals in 33 games. A player the stature of Mata was needed by United at a time of deep crisis, with David Moyes clinging on to his job and Ed Woodward needing to prove his ability in the transfer market. Mourinho no longer saw them as rivals so sanctioned a move but still ensured maximum value. Moving on: Kevin De Bruyne left Chelsea after making a handful of starts before moving to Wolfsburg . Time to go: De Bruyne and Mata both left Chelsea during January last season . Besiktas have wanted a pivotal striker for some time and in Ba have a player who is guaranteed to get goals in the Turkish top-flight. He still had two years on his deal at Stamford Bridge hence the inflated sum. PSG, meanwhile, are in thrall to glamour and superstar signings. For all Luiz’s defensive frailities he is an excellent ball player, passer, and shot-maker, and carries the allure of Samba style. His gargantuan price still makes the eyes pop, though. Stepping up: Daniel Sturridge has progressed since leaving Chelsea for Liverpool in January 2013 . Lukaku is a proven scorer in the Premier League and fits with Roberto Martinez’ s designs at Everton. By paying such a price the club have also elevated themselves to a higher plane, a persuasive argument in convincing their best players to continue – such as Ross Barkley – and bringing better ones in. But Mourinho, the Happy One, will be beaming the most. At a stroke he has overhauled his squad and still has cash to spare. Paris match: David Luiz swapped Chelsea for PSG for £50m this summer .

"A new documentary about the deadly Trans World Airline Flight 800 featuring interviews with former investigators claims that the official explanation given for the ill-fated flight is wrong. The flight crashed off the coast of Long Island in 1996, killing all 230 people on board in what is the third-deadliest aviation accident in U.S. history. The official explanation given by the . National Transportation Safety Board was that the . crash was caused by a gas tank explosion, but the documentary gives 'solid proof' there was an external detonation, its co-producer said. Many eye-witnesses claimed they had seen a streak of fire heading towards the plane before it crashed. Theories have suggested it was a missile strike from a terrorist or U.S. Navy . vessel, and that the incident was subject to a government . cover-up. Scroll down for video . The remains of the TWA Flight 800 from New York to Paris that exploded off Long Island, New York, reassembled from recovered wreckage . But now the producers of TWA FLIGHT 800, which premieres on July 17, the anniversary of the crash, on cable network EPIX, said they have more than just eye-witness statements to call on. 'Of course, everyone knows about the eyewitness statements, but we also have corroborating information from the radar data, and the radar data shows a(n) asymmetric explosion coming out of that plane - something that didn't happen in the official theory,' Tom Stalcup told CNN's New Day. He said many witnesses said that there was an external force and 'there's no evidence' of the explosion in the center wing tank. He added that none of the witnesses had been allowed to testify. The producers have now submitted a petition signed by former investigators calling for the NTSB  to reopen its investigation, based on the new evidence, Stalcup told CNN. Among the whistle-blowers who worked on the investigation are Hank Hughes, a senior accident investigator, Bob Young, a TWA investigator, and Jim Speer, an accident investigator for the Airline Pilots Association. Investigators who worked on the plane following the crash and co-producer Tom Stalcup, said there was no evidence that the explosion came from the wing tank . Firetrap: Images from the documentary show damaged seats on the plane, aboard which 230 people died . 'We weren’t allowed to talk about the TWA 800 investigation when we were inside,' Young said. 'We had to retire first. That took a while. 'What [witnesses] told us doesn’t fit the mechanical failure scenario that was presented to the public at the end of our investigation.' 'The very next day [after the crash], the FBI came to speak to me and said, ""you did not see that, you saw nothing"",' one investigator said. The documentary features interviews . with these key members of the original investigation team, who now claim . that their investigation was systematically undermined. 'This . team of investigators who actually handled the wreckage and victims' bodies, prove that the officially proposed fuel-air explosion did not . cause the crash,' said the film's producers. 'They also provide radar and forensic . evidence proving that one or more ordinance explosions outside the . aircraft caused the crash.' The whistleblower team claim that at . the time they were placed under a gag order by the NTSB, which they . charged falsified the official conclusion of the cause of the crash, . reports Fox News. However, the statement said they did not speculate about the source or sources of any ordinance explosions. The deadly crash occurred just 12 minutes after take-off from JFK International Airport on the flight bound for Paris, France. Skeptic: Jim Speer, an accident investigator for the Airline Pilots Association who appears in the documentary, inspects damage after the crash. Right, part of the plane's wing is seen in the water off New York . Officials have dismissed allegations of a cover-up, saying evidence strongly points to their conclusion . More than 600 people gave eye-witness . accounts after seeing the plane crash and the majority described seeing a . ‘rising streak of light’ moments before the crash' which many believed . was a missile hitting the plane. Many witnesses to the accident had . seen a 'streak of light' that was usually described as ascending, moving . to a point where a large fireball appeared, with several witnesses . reporting that the fireball split in two as it descended toward the . water. There was intense public interest in . these witness reports and much speculation that the reported streak of . light was a missile that had struck TWA 800, causing the airplane to . explode. These witness accounts were a major reason for the initiation . and duration of the FBI's criminal investigation. 'Revelations': The documentary, TWA FLIGHT 800, premieres on July 17 at 8PM ET on cable network EPIX . An image shows the reconstructed section of the plane. Although 90 per cent of the aircraft was recovered, only the section around the central fuel tank was reconstructed . Approximately 80 FBI agents conducted . interviews with potential witnesses daily. They conducted a 16-month . investigation and concluded that there was no evidence to indicate that . any criminal act occurred. The NTSB told CNN that it was aware of the documentary and that the producers intend to file a petition to reopen the investigation. 'As required by NTSB regulation, a petition for reconsideration of board findings ... must be based on the discovery of NEW evidence or on a showing that the board's findings are erroneous,' NTSB spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said in a statement.

"A woman was rushed to hospital and hundreds of people were quarantined today after she showed symptoms of Ebola virus infection in a jobcentre in Germany. As many as 600 visitors and staff at the employment office building in Berlin were also stopped from leaving for several hours as emergency services sealed off part of the street. The mass-circulation daily Bild said the woman had fainted, that she hailed from Nigeria and that she said later that she had recently been in contact with people infected with Ebola.

Several people who had been with the woman were taken to hospital for testing . Several people who had been with the woman inside the building in the north-eastern district of Prenzlauer Berg were later taken to hospital for testing. Berlin fire department spokesman Rolf Erbe said that because the patient came from 'an area affected by a highly contagious disease, we took these precautions.' He said the testing in the city's Charite hospital would take some time. 'The patient was isolated inside the ambulance, the staff took the appropriate protective measures. An emergency medic, the public health officer, arrived and the necessary precautions were taken,' he added. Precautions: An ambulance carries a suspected Ebola virus carrier  to Charite hospital . Plague: Job seekers and jobcentre employees wait for permission from police to leave the building after it was put on lockdown by emergency services scared that they might have been infected with Ebola virus .

A spokesman for the city's health authority said emergency services were called after the woman collapsed. All 600 people quarantined within the centre were in the suspected victim's vicinity before she collapsed. West Africa's Ebola epidemic, which has hit four nations since it broke out in Guinea early this year, is by far the deadliest since the virus was discovered four decades ago in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. The World Health Organization said today the Ebola virus had killed 84 people in just three days, bringing the global death toll to 1,229, while confirmed, probable and suspect infections rose to 2,240. The outbreak is not yet under control, the UN health agency said, although there have been no confirmed cases of the disease spreading beyond the region at its centre. Prepared: Infectious disease specialist Florian Steiner, leftm and quarantine office leader Thomas Klotzkowski disinfect themselves during a demonstration at Berlin's Charite hospital last week . A spokesman said: 'As recent experience shows, progress is fragile, with a real risk that the outbreak could experience another flare-up. 'A case in a previously unaffected area was reported last week, indicating continuing spread to new areas.' European countries have been taking precautions against a possible spread, with Berlin's Charite hospital, where the woman showing symptoms was taken today, last week holding a photocall for the media to publicise its readiness.","Woman arrived at the jobcentre with a high fever, then collapsed .

"Barack Obama has insisted he deserves another term in the White House and today revealed he's learned a lot about how to be president since he took office four years ago. The U.S. President told NBC that he does ‘deserve a second term - but we’re not done’ and added that one of the toughest parts of the job is seeing his wife dragged into the political realm. He will 'keep on plodding away’ and said many Americans are only frustrated with his performance because he hasn’t been able to ‘force Congress to implement every aspect of what I said in 2008’. Scroll down for video . Exhausted: President Barack Obama, appearing in a television interview for NBC on Sunday, insisted that he does 'deserve a second term' and will continue to 'keep plodding' to get Congress to act on his ideas . President Obama was asked by NBC’s . Today show host Matt Lauer about how he felt when Michelle Obama told . CBS last month that she has been inaccurately portrayed as an ‘angry . black woman’. He said his wife is a great First . Lady, Americans have a good impression of her and she is ready for . another four years in the White House - despite initial reservations . about coming to Washington. President Obama also bemoaned his . trouble getting Congress to act on his ideas. ‘Our founders designed a . system that makes it more difficult to bring about change than I would . like,’ he said. ‘What I'm going to just keep on doing . is plodding away, very persistent. And you know what? One of the things . about being president is you get better as time goes on,’ President . Obama told NBC. Early days: Mr Obama was optimistic about making good on his promise to build bi-partisanship in Washington in a 2009 interview, shot just ten days into his presidency . He admitted he still struggles as a . father with his family being brought into politics, saying it ‘isn’t . always very pleasant’ and ‘weighs on me’. ‘I could not be prouder of . her,’ he said of Mrs Obama. 'What I'm going to just keep on doing is plodding away, very persistent. And you know what? One of the things about being president is you get better as time goes on' President Barack Obama . Mr Lauer brought up President . Obama’s 2009 pre-Super Bowl interview, when he had said: ‘If I don’t . have this done in three years, it’s going to be a one-term proposition.’ He responded that was in part because . the economic recovery looked bleak in 2009, saying: ‘When you and I sat . down (in 2009), we were losing 750,000 jobs a month. Now we’re creating . 250,000.’ President Obama added that the economy . has added 3.7million jobs in the last 23 months, and the most . manufacturing jobs since the early 1990s.

'Our founders designed a system that makes it more difficult to bring about change than I would like' President Barack Obama . In a turn of good news for President . Obama, the unemployment rate fell to 8.3 per cent in January, its lowest . since February 2009. That has been debate fodder for the GOP . presidential candidates. Republican frontrunner Mitt Romney . accused the president of not including the underemployed and those who . have stopped looking for work in his victory speech following the Nevada . caucuses. ‘The real unemployment rate is over 15 . per cent, Mr President,’ Mr Romney said. ‘America has also had enough . of your kind help.’ President Obama said the economic . recovery process is lengthy and delicate. ‘The key right now is to make . sure we don’t start turning in a new direction that could throw that . progress off,’ he said.

"Hundreds of protesters in Libya have launched an attack on the jihadist militia responsible for killing the U.S. ambassador last week. The pro-American backlash on Friday night saw the Ansar al-Sharia Brigade driven out of its base in the city of Benghazi, where Chris Stevens and three other U.S. officials were murdered in an attack on the local consulate. The unprecedented movement suggests that ordinary Libyans are rising up against Al Qaeda fighters who seek to hijack the democratic reforms of the Arab Spring. Scroll down for video . Raid: Protesters have driven out the Ansar al-Sharia militia from its headquarters in Benghazi . Backlash: The raid suggests ordinary Libyans are turning against Islamists seeking to exploit the Arab Spring . Liberation: A demonstrator celebrates while standing on top of the militia's old headquarters . Ansar al-Sharia militants initially fired in the air to disperse the crowd, but eventually abandoned the site with their weapons and vehicles after it was overrun by waves of protesters shouting 'No to militias.' 'I don't want to see armed men wearing Afghani-style clothes stopping me in the street to give me orders, I only want to see people in uniform,' said Omar Mohammed, a college student who took part in the takeover of the site. No deaths were reported in the incident, which came after tens of thousands marched in Benghazi against armed militias. One vehicle was also burned at the compound. For many Libyans, the September 11 consulate attack was the last straw in one of the biggest problems Libya has faced since the death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi last year - the multiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are stronger than the regular armed forces and police. The militias, a legacy of the rag-tag popular forces that fought Gaddafi's regime, call themselves protectors of Libya's revolution, providing security where police cannot. But many say they act like gangs, detaining and intimidating rivals and carrying out killings. Victory: Civilians watch on as much of the base in central Benghazi goes up in smoke on Friday night . Celebration: Demonstrators cheer after storming the headquarters of the Ansar al-Sharia . Carnage: Although no deaths were reported, several vehicles appeared to be burned out . Militias made up of Islamic radicals like Ansar al-Sharia are notorious for attacks on Muslims who do not follow their hardline ideology. Officials and witnesses say fighters from Ansar al-Sharia led the attack on the U.S. consulate. After taking over the Ansar compound, protesters then drove to attack the Benghazi headquarters of another Islamist militia, Rafallah Sahati. The militiamen opened fire on the protesters, who were largely unarmed. At least 20 were wounded, and there were unconfirmed reports of three protesters being killed. Earlier in the day, some 30,000 people filled a broad boulevard as they marched along a lake in central Benghazi to the gates of the headquarters of Ansar al-Sharia. Support: On a march through Benghazi, many expressed sympathy with U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens . Dissent: Mr Stevens, who died in a raid on the U.S. consulate last Tuesday, was popular in Libya . Mourning: Mr Stevens, pictured with Hillary Clinton, was an experienced diplomat . 'No, no, to militias,' the crowd chanted. They carried banners and signs demanding that militias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security. 'Benghazi is in a trap,' signs read. 'Where is the army, where is the police?' Other signs mourned the killing of Mr Stevens, reading, 'The ambassador was Libya's friend' and 'Libya lost a friend'. Military helicopters and fighter jets flew overhead, and police mingled in the crowd, buoyed by the support of the protesters. The march was the biggest seen in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city and home to 1million people, since the fall of Gaddafi in August 2011. The public backlash comes in part in frustration with the interim government, which has been unable to rein in the armed factions. Many say that officials' attempts to co-opt fighters by paying them have only fueled the growth of militias without bringing them under state control or integrating them into the regular forces.","Ansar al-Sharia thrown out of Benghazi compound by protesters and army .

"A plasterer was hailed a hero today for punching and detaining a hoodie after catching him red-handed stealing lead from the church next to his home. Catholic Jon-Paul Fawcett, 28, was watching Euro 2012 when he spotted yob Neil Langley stealing lead from the church window pane, balancing on a vase taken from a nearby grave. He was so disgusted that he stormed up to him saying: 'What do you think you are playing at, nicking from a church?' Hero: Catholic plasterer Jon-Paul Fawcett, 28, . was watching Euro 2012 when he spotted yob Neil Langley stealing lead . from the church opposite his home and stormed over to confront him . When Langley, 30, lashed out Mr Fawcett, thumped him in self defence, fearing he was armed with a chisel, then carried out a citizen's arrest grabbing him by the arms then pinning him to the ground while police were called to the scene. During the scuffle, Mr Fawcett's mobile phone accidentally rang his father who overheard the commotion and was so upset he had a heart attack. He has since recovered. Today, as Langley began 12 weeks jail for theft, Mr Fawcett, who has a close connection to St Paul's Church in Nelson, Lancashire and recently became a godparent there, was commended for his bravery. Yob: Neil Langley has been jailed for 12 weeks for theft after being caught red-handed by Mr Fawcett . 'It was just instinct and I would do . it again in a flash if I had to,' said Mr Fawcett who lives in a street . to the adjacent to the church. 'I didn’t really consider that I might . have got hurt but it was my duty to do something and protect my . community. 'I was brought up . a Catholic and my two kids are Catholic and it’s despicable. Only three . weeks ago I was in that church fulfilling my role as a godfather at a . Christening. It’s a lovely church both inside and out that is about 200 . years old. 'It was insulting . that he could do something like this. Thefts like this are not fair on . the elderly people who live around here either. They have moved here for . a quiet, peaceful life and something like this happens. 'That guy was scum and he effectively made my dad have a heart attack. ‘The . amount of jobs which we get called out to where a property is leaking . because of a metal theft or a shop which has had lead taken is . unbelievable. 'They are . low-life's. And to steal from a church, they should be put in the . gutter, I’m glad he’s gone to prison. He had absolutely no shame doing . this in broad daylight.' Burnley . magistrates court was told Mr Fawcett had been watching a Euro 2012 . football match TV when he looked up at half-time and spotted Langley . stripping lead flashing at 8.30pm on June 13 this year. He went outside and shouted at . Langley to stop only for the yob to deny stealing and to falsely claim . he was putting the window pane back. Mr . Fawcett added: 'I could see somebody wearing a black hooded jacket . messing about and he even taken a vase from someone’s grave to stand on . so he could get to the lead. Theft: Langley tried to deny stealing lead from the window pane falsely claiming he was putting it back . Furious: Langley targeted St Paul's Church in Nelson, Lancashire and Mr Fawcett said stealing from a church is the 'lowest of the low'. Many people turned out to watch the commotion when the surprise arrest was made . 'I . was furious. I thought it was disgusting what he had been doing. He was . coming towards me with his arms waving. I thought he was going to take a . swing for me so I just punched him. 'Then . he tried to turn around to make a run for it so I gripped him and made a . citizen’s arrest. I grabbed the back of his hands and grabbed hold of . his belt which snapped and it cut all my hand. I knew I had to get him. 'Then . I got his arm and put it up his back so he couldn’t move and held on to . him. There was a lot of commotion and a bit of a scuffle but nothing . serious. I did what I had to do to restrain him. 'I . go to the gym so I’m quite strong and I knew I was stronger than him. He was saying ‘can we just talk’ but I thought ‘no what you are doing is . wrong’. It’s the lowest of the low stealing from a church and he is . scum. Community spirit: Jon-Paul Fawcett with Rev Fr Philip Knowles outside the 200-year-old St Paul's Church. Rev Knowles said it's nice to know that there are people who are looking out for the community . 'Meanwhile elderly people had come out of their houses to see what was going on and they were all watching. I shouted for them to call the police. 'I had his arm up behind his back and I walked him over to where they were stood. He kept pleading with me to ask if we could talk but I wasn’t having any of it. 'Unbeknown to me, my phone was in my pocket and had called my dad. He had picked it up and he’d heard the commotion and started to panic. He thought I was in trouble at first. Shortly afterwards he suffered a heart attack and had to hospital. 'When the police arrived they knew who he was instantly and addressed him using first name terms. 'My phone started ringing and it was my mum telling me how proud she was because they’d heard everything on the phone. 'She kept saying, ‘I’m so proud of you’, but then she said my dad was having a funny turn and then my sister called to say he’d been taken to hospital in an ambulance.' Catholic: Jon-Paul has a close connection to the church and was pictured at a christening service (at the back in a light grey suit and black shirt) just three weeks ago . In court Mrs Alex Mann prosecuting said: 'The church warden says that lead was missing and other pieces of lead were loose. It will cost a substantial amount of money to fix.' In mitigation for the former drug addict, defence lawyer Ben Leech said: 'He has very little recollection of what happened. 'He had been in a pub and had got himself in some trouble either inside or outside of it and tried to escape by going into the churchyard. He believed his drink may have been spiked.' After the case Rev Fr Philip Knowles of St Paul’s Church said: 'It is very sad that people feel that they have to fund whatever they have to fund by doing something like this through criminal activity. 'It’s sad and I feel for them that they end up doing something like this. 'The church is 200 years old and there has been a church on this site for the last 800 years. Lead thefts is something that all churches have been suffering from. Obviously the broken pane of glass will have to be replaced at a cost. 'People like Jon-Paul who just happened to see what was going on felt compelled to do something. It is nice to know that there are people like him who are looking out for the community and it shows good community spirit.'","Jon-Paul Fawcett thumped the yob in self-defence and then grabbed his arms and pinned him to the ground .

"The population in Britain is rising more steeply than anywhere else in Europe, according to official estimates yesterday. Numbers rose by almost 420,000 in a year, driven by the highest birth rate since 1972. The figure, which covers the 12 months to the middle of 2012 is more than the population increases in Germany, Belgium, Holland and Sweden combined. Scroll down for video . Increase: Since 1992 the UK population has risen by 6.1million, a rise of 11 per cent . The Office for National Statistics says around four in ten of the additional people are immigrants. Six out of ten are the result of rising birth rates, which brought a 40-year high in the number of babies born last year – 254,400 more births than deaths. But a major cause of the baby boom is immigration. More than a quarter of all newborns have mothers who were born abroad. The total number of people living in the UK at the end of last June was 63,705,000. The rate of population increase last year held steady despite Coalition attempts to reduce immigration, the ONS said. Its report said the 419,900 increase in population for 2011-12 was ‘about average’ for the past decade. Annual population growth first hit the 400,000 mark in 2005, following the opening of Britain’s borders and labour market to Poles and other Eastern Europeans in 2004. The increase in the number of people living in the UK was higher than any other country in the European Union . If the increasing numbers continue unchecked, the population will hit the landmark 70million point in the early months of 2027. The figure is a level at which many commentators believe housing, transport, utilities, education and the NHS will be severely stretched. Yesterday’s estimates mean that by the middle of 2012 Home Secretary Theresa May’s efforts to reduce net immigration – the amount by which migrants push up the population each year – to 1990s levels had yet to have an impact on the total number of people in the country. The figure is currently 165,000. Divide: London and the south saw bigger increases in population between mid-2011 and mid-2012 . UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: ‘These figures show the continuing failure of the Government to get a grip on immigration into this country. The results of this increase in population can be felt in communities up and down the country as public services struggle to cope with the increase in demand.’ He added: ‘At the same time we face cuts to frontline services and send billions of pounds abroad in foreign aid. And this is before Romanian and Bulgarian citizens have full access to the UK come January next year.’ The British population increase was almost a third higher than the rise in the next fastest-growing EU country, France. During the same period the French population rose by just over 319,000. Numbers in Germany went up by 166,000, in Belgium by 91,000, in Sweden by 70,000 and in Holland by 62,000. All have been magnets for immigration in recent years. But Britain’s population is expected to outstrip those of France and Germany over the  coming decades, becoming the most populous country in Europe by 2050. Numbers here have gone up by more than half a million since the last national census, taken in March 2011. Since 2001 the population increase has been 4.6 million, the ONS said. London saw the greatest rise in 2011-12, at more than 100,000. The rapid change came despite 51,000 people leaving the capital, mainly for homes in the suburban towns of southern and eastern England. Paul Vickers of the ONS said: ‘A quarter of the UK population increase happened in London. Together, London, the South East and East of England accounted  for over half the growth.’ The population pyramid shows how many people of each age there were, including the large numbers of so-called baby boomers and the low birth rate a decade ago . One in three migrants arriving in Britain went to London. International net migration – the number of immigrants minus the number of emigrants – was 69,000. Simon Ross, of pressure group Population Matters, said: ‘Our growing population is the root of many of our most pressing problems, including a lack of housing, pressure on services and development threats to our countryside and green spaces. ‘These, together with consequent infrastructure investments and transport issues are increasing costs for everyone. ‘Measures by the Government to limit net migration are to be welcomed. However, the Government should also promote the benefits  to individuals and society of smaller families.’","New figures show there were 63.7million in the UK in mid-2012 .

"Technology: Sussex Police wants to equip bobbies with tablet computers like iPads so they can work on the move . A police force which is cutting 500 front-line jobs to save money is issuing officers with iPad-style tablets so they can do their paperwork on the move.

For example, if the force gave the . £999 Blackberry PlayBook Tablet to all its 3,200 officers the bill could . be greater than £3million. A report written in the name of chief . constable Martin Richards says 'Sussex Police will be at the forefront . of technology with the tablet as an operating platform. 'This technology has a potential to . create a truly mobile solution for police officers at a lower cost when . compared with laptops and PDAs.' Sussex Police HQ in Lewes: The force will trial the tablets in the Lewes area and hope to role out the technology to the rest of the force later on . The report adds that officers will be 'able to complete crime reports and witness statements on the move'. A force spokeswoman said that officers . would be able to go online 'for legitimate purposes' only, adding that . there were 'policies and procedures in place to monitor for any improper . use'. The force’s neighbourhood policing . scrutiny committee is expected to approve the start of a trial of . between ten and 50 of the tablets when it meets this week. The trial, which will be carried out . by teams in the Lewes district, will run for three months and could then . be expanded to other areas of the force. The force has refused to reveal . the brands and models of the devices that would be considered but said . that the trial will cost £25,000. A spokeswoman said the majority of . this was for the design, development and setting up the trial but the . public could not be given any more details for reasons of 'commercial . confidentiality'. Chief Insp Jason Tingley, the force’s . district commander for Lewes, said 'Response officers have seen the . mobile tablets and are very keen to start using them as soon as they . can. 'This is an exciting development and . the pilot at the end of this month will test the usability of the . devices and we hope will provide a new and more agile way of working.' It's not the first time Sussex Police have been in the press. The force has come under fire for its decision to recruit five spin doctors while slashing frontline officers. In March the force claimed they were advertising for new . posts to maintain their ‘popular website’, ‘teach officers to use . Twitter’ and sell the idea of cuts to its workforce. And, its communications manager hit the headlines earlier this year when she was caught using her official Twitter account to Tweet pictures of cakes in the office.","The bill for Sussex Police could run into millions of pounds .
It comes as the force is cutting 500 jobs to save £50million from its budget ."
"Sarah Palin could be set to lose both her marriage and her political career after the release of the  explosive biography on the Tea Party darling. The National Enquirer claims that friends close to the politician and her husband Todd say he is 'fed up' with the constant scandals that . have plagued their marriage ever since she ran for vice president and is ready to file for a divorce. As well as kissing goodbye to her . marriage, it has also been alleged that her advisers have told her to . kiss goodbye to the White House fearing a bid would be 'political . suicide'. In The Rogue: Searching for the Real Sarah Palin, the 47-year-old is accused of having a night of passion with a basketball star, snorting cocaine and having an affair with her husband's business partner - all allegations which are thought to have shattered Palin's White House dream.

A source close to the former vice . presidential candidate said: 'Sarah Palin has been destroyed by Joe . McGinniss' no-holds-barred biography. It exposed all her lies, cover-ups . and secrets. 'As a result she has been told by her . advisers that it would be political suicide to announce a White House . candidacy. The press and her opponents would have a field day digging . into the dirty details of her background.' Brother: Chuck 'Chuckie' Heath Jr told friends that Todd and Sarah 'didn't have a marriage' The bombshell book is said to have . put the final nail in the coffin of her marriage, after Sarah's brother . Chuckie was quoted saying his sister and Todd's marriage was over. A friend told the National Enquirer: . 'The final straw was McGinniss quoting Sarah's brother Chuckie telling a . friend they don't have a marriage. 'Todd felt as if he was stabbed in . the back by his own brother-in-law after 23 years of being married to . the guy's sister, and having five kids together.' It was revealed last week that former . basketball player Glen Rice had a one-time fling with the Alaska . governor when she was a news anchor for her local station and he was a . junior at the University of Michigan. The source told the Enquirer that . Todd feels like he's been made a laughing stock as the hook up had . become a joke on late night TV and was all over the internet. He was also said to be 'fuming' over . the biography's confirmation that his wife had an affair with his . business partner Brad Hanson and that Todd dissolved their snowmobile . dealership after learning of it. Though both parties denied it at the . time it came to light in October 2008, Palin's ex brother-in-law Mike . Wooten allegedly confirmed it saying: 'Todd and Sarah were headed for . divorce, but Sarah got pregnant soon after, so they decided to stay . together.' The new book also claims that Palin snortedcocaine off a 55-gallon oil drum and separately smoked marijuana in secret liaisons . with one of her college professors. The book's author Joe McGinniss moved in next door to the Palins in Alaska to dig dirt . for his salacious biography. In . response, Todd Palin slammed the author as a 'stalker' who has a . 'creepy obsession' with his wife after details of what was in the book . were first leaked. He said: 'This is a man who has been relentlessly stalking my family to the point of moving in right next door to us to harass us and spy on us to satisfy his creepy obsession with my wife. His book is full of disgusting lies, innuendo, and smears. Even The New York Times called this book ""dated, petty,"" and that it ""chases caustic, unsubstantiated gossip"". Mrs Palin, meanwhile, has been careful to avoid commenting. Styled: Palin in her more familiar look. A new book alleges she has taken cocaine in the past and had a six-month affair with a former business partner of her husband Todd . Separation?: Todd Palin, seen here with his wife outside their house in Wasilla, Alaska, is said to be filing for a divorce .

She allegedly had a tryst with . basketball star Glen Rice in her younger sister Molly's University of . Alaska dorm room, while she was dating Todd and just nine months before . the couple were married. Mrs Palin got pregnant with Todd and they eloped in August 1988. Their son Track, the oldest of five, was born eight months later in April 1989. A . friend said Mrs Palin spent the night with the basketball star but . could not confirm whether they had sex, according to the National . Enquirer. 'I remember Sarah feeling pretty good that she'd been with a black basketball star,' a source told the magazine. The athlete is said to have confirmed the night of passion in Mr McGinniss's book. Mr Rice went on to have a huge career playing basketball in the NBA and was a three-timer All-Star. Heat: The book alleges that Palin had a one night stand with basketball star Glen Rice . The . explosive book goes on to quote those who knew the family growing up, . claiming Mrs Palin was a 'bad mum' who would lock herself in her room . for hours on end asking not to be disturbed while her children cooked . themselves dinner. Sarah Palin was plucked from obscurity to be the Republican vice presidential candidate in 2008. The 'pitbull in lipstick' sparked a media storm after accepting the nomination, despite questions over her experience. But she wowed the U.S. after a . barn-storming speech in September 2008 in which she attacked critics for . calling her 'small town'. Six months: Palin is said to have had an affair with Brad Hanson, one of her husband's colleagues . A former mayor of Wasilla before she . became governor of Alaska, Palin stepped down after the Republican . defeat in the presidential election. The . mother-of-five has remained tight-lipped on whether she would stand . next year, but said she would likely make an announcement at the end of . this month. She has been overshadowed in recent months by Tea Party candidates including Michelle Bachmann. The . Republican, who has now associated herself with the Tea Party movement . in the U.S., has been dogged by scandal since being selected as Senator . John McCain's running mate in 2007. There have also been frequent rumours that she is set to divorce her husband Todd, which have always been denied. And she has faced accusations by the . father of her daughter's child, Levi Johnston, that she wanted to keep . Bristol's pregnancy a secret and adopt the child herself. Palin has yet to declare whether she intends to run for election in next year's presidential race.

"A former host at a popular Christian radio station  has pleaded guilty in a child pornography investigation. John Balyo told a federal judge last week that he photographed sex acts with a 12-year-old boy at a Kalamazoo County motel in April after paying him then handcuffing the child to a bed. He pleaded guilty to sexual exploitation and possessing child pornography. Balyo, of Battle Creek, Michigan, said he knew it was wrong. Former Christian radio DJ John Balyo, 35, (pictured with an unidentified child), was charged with having sex with a minor. He pleaded guilty in court last week where he told the judge that he knew he was wrong . The boy's family were in court for the plea hearing in Grand Rapids and wept as details of sexual assault were heard, Freep.com reported. Balyo told the court: 'I did take images of a child and they were sexually explicit involving bondage and nudity. I performed sex acts as described. I knew it was wrong.' The 35-year-old was a host at Christian radio station WCSG in Grand Rapids until his arrest in June at a Christian music festival in northern Michigan. His arrest was related to state charges of criminal sexual conduct. Balyo faces a mandatory minimum of 15 years in federal prison, but he could be sentenced to the rest of his life behind bars. Balyo admitted in June that he had a rented storage unit where he kept a 'bondage kit' of handcuffs, chains and duct tape, a federal spokesman confirmed to MailOnline. It is claimed that Balyo paid a man to arrange a sex session with a minor for him. He was arrested in June while at the Big Ticket Christian music festival in Gaylord, Michigan. Handcuffs and other items were found in a suitcase after police searched a storage unit in Plainfield Township. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokesman told MailOnline in June that while being interviewed Balyo indicated that he had a storage unit and gave officers permission to search the space. A padlock, rubber gloves and children's socks were also discovered, MLive reported. Balyo also had piles of articles about missing children and children's obituaries, it was reported, along with an erotic photography magazine. The accused was denied bail after being charged with first- and second-degree criminal sexual conduct. He is now facing the rest of his life in prison. Balyo is married and has a stepson, according to the Christian Post. Balyo got married in April, the same month that he committed the sex crime. The DJ allegedly paid resident Ronald Moser, 41, to have sex with a young boy through a website he ran. Authorities who raided Moser's property on June 5 found him at a home with a boy. Balyo, (pictured in his June mugshot), who got married in April, admitted to sexually assaulting a 12-year-old boy in the same month . Under his plea agreement, Balyo will testify against Moser. According to mlive.com, in a photo album allegedly posted online by Moser, there were ten images of a young boy lying face down on a bed. His hands and feet were bound and he was wearing only underwear, which had been rolled up to show his buttocks, according to a federal agent. The albums had titles such as 'very cute boy,' and 'sexy boys', police said. The FBI said Moser put images online and planned to trade in child porn. It is alleged that Moser ran a website providing sex with underage boys for money. The investigation into the alleged pedophiles has involved multiple agencies as part of a larger 'Operation Predator'. Balyo was fired from his job at WCSG and the station publicly asked for prayers for the former host, his family and alleged victims. The 35-year-old had been at the radio station for eight years. In a statement at the time of Balyo's arrest, WCSG said: 'We sincerely grieve over these recent events, in particular the tragic impact on victims and their parents. The trafficking and exploitation of minors is absolutely deplorable. 'The WCSG family is deeply aching and know you may be hurting as well.' A spokesman added: 'We know that no one, absolutely no one, is immune from falling into the darkness of sin. And yet, we have hope. Those who truly follow and live for Jesus Christ know He alone has the power to restore broken lives and broken trust.' Balyo will be sentenced in November.","John Balyo told a federal judge on Tuesday that he photographed sex acts with a 12-year-old boy at a Kalamazoo County hotel .

"Sam Allardyce appears to have fallen into line with the West Ham board over the future of Ravel Morrison - if the midfielder works hard enough. The 21-year-old looked to be set for a season on the fringes of the Hammers' first-team with Allardyce unconvinced by the attitude of the former Manchester United youngster. But co-chairman David Sullivan publicly disagreed with Allardyce, insisting the club were keen to tie Morrison down to a long-term contract. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Morrison score two outrageous goals in England training . Another chance? It seems Ravel Morrison could be back in the fold this season for West Ham . ‘Sam has said Ravel is not part of his plans but we do - as a board - see him as part of our plans,’ Sullivan said last week. ‘I think he (Allardyce) said in a press conference, if I read it correctly, he's not part of his plans for this season. I think he said that in New Zealand but we don't agree with that. We would like to sit down and give him a longer contract. ‘We do see him as part of the long-term future of the club but we have to agree it with the manager because there's no point signing a player he's not going to play.’ Talent: Morrison showcased his prestigious talent last season before falling out of favor with boss Sam Allardyce . Having broken into the first-team at the start of last season, Morrison's star seemed to be on the rise as he endeared himself to West Ham fans after scoring a memorable goal in a 3-0 win at rivals Tottenham. But his form waned following a niggling groin injury, which has now been treated with a minor operation, and he ended the season on loan at QPR with his future at Upton Park in question. But now Allardyce, who saw Enner Valencia become his fifth summer signing after being granted a work permit on Tuesday, has backed the England Under-21 international to come good again. Change of heart? Allardyce (centre) has questioned Morrison's attitude in the past but seems to have changed his mind . ‘We thought we'd brought Ravel to the forefront of his abilities this time last season,’ he told talkSPORT. ‘He had a fantastic pre-season and started the season very well. That drifted away a bit and he ended up at QPR, helping them get promoted. ‘If he gets back to knuckling down, and getting used to the discipline side of the game, then his talents are outstanding.’","Midfielder broke into the team last season but lost form and had surgery .

"Crushing pressures, powerful winds and acidic clouds have meant that any probes ever sent to Venus have only ever lasted a few hours. Now Nasa is proposing a windsurfing rover that it claims could to take on Venus' severe environment by sailing across its surface. The rover, dubbed the Zephyr, is designed to work at extremely low powers while carrying electronics that can function at a temperature of 450°C. The rover, dubbed the Zephyr, is being proposed by Geoffrey Landis of the Glenn Research Center. It is designed to work at extremely low powers and only has two moving parts . It is being . designed by Geoffrey Landis of the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland as . part of Nasa’s Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) programme. Venus is often labelled as Earth's twin due to its similar size, gravity and ‘terrestrial’ composition, which is largely made up of silicate rocks or metals. In reality, however, Venus is thought to be one of the most hostile environments in the solar system. The planet is cloaked in a thick layer of highly reflective clouds of sulphuric acid. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets in our solar system, consisting mostly of carbon dioxide. The tri-wheeled Venus Landsailing Rover-rising some seven meters or 22 feet above the Venus terrain- will be mostly stationary.analysing the ground, and every now and then will rove across Venus to a new spot . The crushing atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is 92 times that of Earth's. ‘Compared to Mars, Venus has been a comparatively unexplored planet,’ said Dr Landis, detailing his progress during the 2013 NIAC Spring Symposium, held last March in Chicago. ‘But Venus is phenomenally difficult to explore,’ he added. Dr Landis claims the ideal vehicle to do so would need to be able to rove across the surface using the ambient resources of the planet. ‘One approach is just live with the high temperatures by using high-temperature devices,’ said Mr Landis. Venus’ environment is comparable to inside of a revved up jet engine, and Glenn technologists have pioneered sensors that can work in these conditions. Venus and its corrosive atmosphere is thought to be one of the most hostile environments in the solar system. The planet is cloaked in a thick layer of highly reflective clouds of sulphuric acid . Venus is a dim world of intense heat and volcanic activity. Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus' thick, toxic atmosphere traps heat. The scorched world has temperatures hot enough to melt lead. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets in our solar system, consisting mostly of carbon dioxide. The crushing atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is 92 times that of Earth's. According to the team, their electronics can function even at the sweltering Venus temperature of 450°C. Venus’ winds are a little over 2mph, but provide significant force. ‘A sail rover would be extraordinary for Venus. The sail has only two moving parts-just to set the sail and set the steering position-and that doesn't require a lot of power. ‘There's no power required to actually drive,’ said Mr Landis. The tri-wheeled Venus Landsailing Rover-rising some seven meters or 22 feet above the Venus terrain-won't be a speedster scooting across the planet, Landis said. Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus' thick, toxic atmosphere traps heat. The scorched world has temperatures hot enough to melt lead . It will be a vehicle that mostly sits in one place, analysing the ground, and every now and then will rove across Venus to a new spot. ‘Most of Venus is remarkably flat,’ he added. ‘It is as flat and rocky as a parking lot.’ The rover is designed to drive equally well forward or backward. This allows the vehicle to back off of obstructions. Mr Landis and his colleagues on the NIAC-funded study envisage 12 square meters of solar cell-laden sail-tooling across Venus for about a month, chalking up 15 minutes of sailing per day. ‘The fundamental elements of a rover for Venus are not beyond the bounds of physics,’ said Mr Landis. ‘We could survive the furnace of Venus if we can come up with an innovative concept for a rover that can move on extremely low power levels,’ he said.","The rover, dubbed the Zephyr, is designed to work at extremely low powers .

"Boys really are more competitive than girls... but only if they come from rich families, say researchers. A study of 15-year-olds found there was a gender gap in the risks they were prepared to take to make more money in a series of maths tests. The Norwegian youngsters were able to earn one krone if they answered a simple question correctly or three  kroner if they gambled on the harder option. Boys are from Mars... The study found that among well-off participants, boys were much more aggressive than girls. Professor Bertil Tungodden said that both biology and culture impact the results . Of the boys, 51 per cent chose the competitive alternative, compared with 31 per cent of the girls. But when the researchers, from the Norwegian School of Economics in Bergen, asked participants about their family circumstances, it became clear class was an important factor. The scientists found that boys from poor families were on the same level as girls from a similar background. But among the well-off participants boys were much more aggressive. Professor Bertil Tungodden, of the Norwegian School of Economics, . Bergen, believes if biology is the decisive factor it has consequences . for politics. He said: 'Our point is if the difference in . competitiveness is a result of women being discriminated or oppressed it . lends legitimacy to politics which aims to balance this difference. 'However, . if our finds primarily reflect basic biological differences the . challenge becomes how to relate to this. 'Of course it is never only the . one or the other. We believe both culture and biology are at play here.' A similar American study from 2007 found 73 per cent of the men were competitive, against just 35 per cent of the women. Cultural impact: According to Professor Tungodden the studies indicate a lack of competitiveness may be a reason why women do not become top leaders . Earlier research among the Maasai tribe in Tanzania, a very patriarchal group, found the men were most competitive whereas women wear the trousers in the matriarchal Khasi people of India. They were even slightly more competitive than the Maasai men. Prof Tungodden said: 'Based on these finds it has been argued competitiveness is culturally determined. 'While it is one thing to look at cultures which are extreme in terms of gender differences, what may be found in the most gender equal society in the world? 'If measures towards gender equality works in regard to competitiveness the gender differences ought to be smaller in countries such as Norway.' But that is not the case. According to Prof Tungodden there are dramatic gender differences among the top executives in Norway, with just ten to fifteen per cent women. He said: 'The studies indicate a lack of competitiveness may be a reason why women do not become top leaders. 'This does not necessarily mean they ought to compete more. Perhaps we need to think differently about the way we recruit top leaders. The most competitive candidate is not necessarily the best leader.'","Boys from poorer families on the same level as girls from similar background .

"The lawyer for the neighbourhood watch captain charged with killing Trayvon Martin in February has waived his right to a quick trial while he prepares his defence. Attorney Mark O’Mara, who is representing George Zimmerman, filed the motion in a Florida court today, saying that he needs more time to ready his case. Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of Martin, 17, a Miami teen who was returning from a store when he was shot by Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida. Awaiting trial: George Zimmerman has been charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin . Lawyer: Mark O'Mara, who is representing Zimmerman, filed a motion in a Florida court today, saying that he needs more time to prepare his case . Zimmerman claimed he was acting in self-defence after he was 'sucker-punched' by Martin. Meanwhile, O'Mara said that some of the money raised by Zimmerman’s legal defence fund website is paying for the 28-year-old’s security and living expenses while he stays in hiding before the trial. O'Mara said that just under $50,000 of the more than $200,000 raised by the now-defunct web page is being used for his security and setting up his living arrangements in hiding. Confrontation: Zimmerman, pictured left in his mugshot, was charged with the second-degree murder in the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin (right) in Sanford, Florida, on February 26 . Defence: George Zimmerman has set up this website to raise funds for his legal costs and living expenses. It was later shut down, but not before it collected more than $200,000 . The other $150,000 raised by the website has been turned over to an independent administrator to manage. The Orlando Sentinel reported that Judge Kenneth Lester planned Zimmerman's next hearing for August 8. Zimmerman was released from jail last month after paying 10 per cent of a $150,000 bail. His current whereabouts are being kept secret for his safety and he is very likely outside of Florida. Court: Judge Kenneth Lester has planned Zimmerman's next hearing for August 8 . He worked at a mortgage risk-management company at the time of the shooting and his wife Shellie is in nursing school. Bail is not unheard of in second-degree . murder cases, and legal experts had predicted it would be granted for . Zimmerman because of his ties to the community, because he turned . himself in after he was charged last week, and because he has never been . convicted of a serious crime. Zimmerman told cops that he spotted . Martin while on patrol in his neighbourhood, which had been plagued by . burglaries in vandalism in recent months, and called 911 to report a . suspicious . person. 'This guy looks like he is up to no . good. He is on drugs or something,' Zimmerman told the dispatcher from . his sport utility vehicle. Sprung: George Zimmerman is now in hiding after his release from jail in Seminole County, Florida, after he posted bail . He added that the teen had his hand in his waistband and was walking around looking at homes. 'These a*******. They always get away,' Zimmerman was heard saying on the 911 call. But . Trayvon was not armed. He was returning from a convenience store with . an iced tea for himself and a bag of skittles for his little brother.

"They are the trademark of celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and Justin Bieber. Now, a rising tide of people are going under the knife desperate to enhance their image, driven by a desire to take a better selfie. From rhinoplasty to eyelid lifts, plastic surgeons say they have seen a surge in patients keen to improve their image. And the driving force? Selfies and the pressure people feel to improve their profile on social media sites. Scroll down for video . A rise in the popularity of taking a selfie is fuelling demand for plastic surgery, experts have said. This selfie, taken by comedian Ellen DeGeneres at this year's Oscars, became the most retweeted in history . Reality star Kim Kardashian (pictured) was accused by her mother Kris Jenner of being 'obsessed' for taking 1,200 selfies on a family trip to Thailand earlier this year . A poll by the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery found one in three surgeons have seen a rise in requests for procedures as a result of patients being more aware of their image on social media. The 2,700 respondents noted a 10 per cent rise in nose jobs, rhinoplasty, in 2013 compared to 2012. And in that time they said they have seen a seven per cent jump in hair transplants and a six per cent jump in eyelid surgery. Dr Sam Rizk, a Manhattan-based plastic surgeon, said: 'There has been a 25 per cent increase over the past year-and-a-half to two years. 'That is very significant. They come in with their iPhones and show me pictures. Selfies are just getting to be so crazy.' Dental hygienist Jennifer Reynolds has always been self-conscious about her looks. She never indulged in selfies and felt uncomfortable being tagged in photographs posted on social media. The 34-year-old from Costa Rica who lives in New York, opted for plastic surgery on her nose. Since her operation she said she now feels ready for social media. 'I definitely feel more comfortable right now with my looks,' she said. 'If I need to take a selfie, without a doubt, I would have no problem.' She is just one of a growing number of people who have turned to plastic surgeons to enhance their image. But Dr Rizk, who specialises in rhinoplasty, said not everyone who requests surgery needs it because a selfie produces a distorted image that does not represent how a person really looks. 'We all will have something wrong with us on a selfie image,' he said. 'I refuse a significant proportion of patients with selfies because I believe it is not a real image of what they actually look like in person.' Some patients get upset when Dr Rizk tells them surgery is not . necessary, and he knows they will simply go to another surgeon.

'You want to enhance your features, perfect your features . but not necessarily change your features into something they are . not,' he said. Dan Ackerman, senior editor with CNET which tests and . reviews products, said the Internet is full of tips and advice . on selfies.

Triana Lavey, 38, now makes a living helping other people make the most of their image on social media. In a bid to take better selfies, and 'look like a supermodel', she had a chin implant, nose job and cheek-defining fat grafts. But now she has turned her attention to helping others build online followings - and the larger their social media reach, the more companies pay to feature in the selfies they post. Clients of the company she works for, uFluencer, can earn between £60,000 and £120,000 a month by including big-name brands in their selfies. The people she works with include young singers who have huge YouTube followings among teens such as That's Heart, Brandon Berg, Becca Lamin and ItsJudyTime, who are all listed on the company's website. The 'Ufluencers', as the company cites them on its website, also include Alphacat, who has 3.5m followers, and ItsJudyTime and Sam Pottorff, who have both amassed over 3m followers. Triana, from Los Angeles in California, USA,believes the ideal pose is for the picture to look fun and organic with their personality resonating through the image - all while looking interested in the product they are paid to promote. Though Triana underwent surgery to look good in her own selfies she doesn't believe other people have to do the same - they just need to feel confident in front of the camera. She said: 'We're living in an exciting time - the future is now with regards to social media and I couldn't be happier to be a part of it. 'Advertisers and brands are learning very quickly that eyes are turning away from traditional media and are looking towards digital entertainment. 'Our clients are enjoying the shift by making a business out of their social media presence. 'uFluencer clients are commanding rates in the tens of thousands for a strategically posted selfie with the advertiser's hashtag on it. 'With the massive following they have acquired, advertisers look to them as the tastemakers of their generation and are willing to pay top dollar for a coveted mention of their product in a video or a single post on Instagram.'

"There are some animals you just wouldn't want to interrupt eating - and crocodiles are very high up on that list. But one daring wildlife photographer decided to rick becoming dessert as he snapped pictured of more than 20 crocodiles feasting on a bloated hippo carcass.

They circled the waters taking it in turns to rip flesh from the hippo with the biggest crocodiles - measuring up to 5m long - being first in the pecking order. Mr Nadler said: 'There is usually admiration and appreciation for the prowess and strength of most predators but crocs are different. 'They evoke a feeling of revulsion and a sense of horror at the thought of how they would kill you; drowning in turpid water grasped in their jaws while they spin to rip chunks of flesh off your body.

"The 17-year pause in global warming . is likely to last into the 2030s and the Arctic sea ice has already . started to recover, according to new research. A . paper in the peer-reviewed journal Climate Dynamics – by Professor . Judith Curry of the Georgia Institute of Technology and Dr Marcia Wyatt – . amounts to a stunning challenge to climate science orthodoxy. Not . only does it explain the unexpected pause, it suggests that the . scientific majority – whose views are represented by the UN . Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) – have underestimated . the role of natural cycles and exaggerated that of greenhouse gases. Pause: How the Earth's average temperature defied scientists' predictions by remaining almost the same . The research comes amid . mounting evidence that the computer models on which the IPCC based the . gloomy forecasts of a rapidly warming planet in its latest report, . published in September, are diverging widely from reality. The . graph shown above, based on a version published by Dr Ed Hawkins of . Reading University on his blog, Climate Lab Book, reveals that actual . temperatures are now below the predictions made by almost all the 138 . models on which the IPCC relies. The . pause means there has been no statistically significant increase in . world average surface temperatures since the beginning of 1997, despite . the models’ projection of a steeply rising trend. According . to Dr Hawkins, the divergence is now so great that the world’s climate . is cooler than what the models collectively predicted with ‘five to 95 . per cent certainty’. Curry . and Wyatt say they have identified a climatic ‘stadium wave’ – the . phenomenon known in Britain as a Mexican wave,  in which the crowd at a . stadium stand and sit so that a wave seems to circle the audience. Recovery: A new study suggests global warming is at a halt and Arctic seas are starting to recover . In similar fashion, a . number of cycles in the temperature of air and oceans, and the level of . Arctic ice, take place across the Northern hemisphere over decades. Curry and Wyatt say there is evidence of this going back at least 300 . years. According to Curry and Wyatt, the theory may explain both the warming pause and why the computer models did not forecast it. It . also means that a large proportion of the warming that did occur in the . years before the pause was due not to greenhouse gas emissions, but to . the same cyclical wave. ‘The . stadium wave signal predicts that the current pause in global warming . could extend into the 2030s,’ said Wyatt. This is in sharp contrast with . the IPCC’s report, which predicts warming of between 0.3 and 0.7C by . 2035. Wyatt added: . ‘The stadium wave forecasts that sea ice will recover from its recent . minimum.’ The record low seen in 2012, followed by the large increase in . 2013, is consistent with the theory, she said. Even IPCC report co-authors such as Dr Hawkins admit some of the models are ‘too hot’. He . said: ‘The upper end of the latest climate model projections is . inconsistent’ with observed temperatures, though he added even the lower . predictions could have ‘negative impacts’ if true. But if the pause lasted another ten years, and there were no large volcanic eruptions, ‘then global surface temperatures would be outside the IPCC’s indicative likely range’. Professor Curry went much further. ‘The growing divergence between climate model simulations and observations raises the  prospect that climate models are inadequate in fundamental ways,’ she said. If the pause continued, this would suggest that the models were not ‘fit for purpose’.","Study says warmer temperatures are largely due to natural 300-year cycles .

"An angelic new picture has been released of Nehemiah Griego, the 15-year-old pastor's son who allegedly gunned down his parents and three younger siblings in Albuquerque, New Mexico on Saturday. Wearing a smart suit and pulling a slight smile for the camera, the undated photograph has been released amid claims Griego was a military obsessed loner who enjoyed playing violent video games like Modern Warfare and Grand Theft Auto. 'The suspect was involved heavily in games, violent games- and was quite excited as he got the opportunity to discuss them with our investigators,' sheriff Dan Houston said at a Tuesday press conference about the shooting. Scroll down for video . This undated photo provided by  shows Nehemiah Griego who is charged with killing five family members, including his father, mother, and three youngest siblings in Albuquerque, New Mexico on Saturday . Local residents of the teenager described a lonesome boy who was always wearing camouflage fatigues and admited to police he had been plagued by suicidal and homicidal thoughts. Neighbours said they would often see Griego by himself and he appears on an online dating site called, www.meetone.com wearing military garb. His profile states, 'I'm a fun-loving guy who likes to make peope happy; I might be shy but I'll open up once you get to know me.' Investigators revealed that 15-year-old Nehemiah Griego said that he killed his relatives because 'he was frustrated with his mother.' The boy told police that he was feeling homicidal and suicidal at the time of the early morning attack on Saturday and he initially planned to drive to a local Walmart and kill more people. He also reportedly considered killing the parents of his 12-year-old girlfriend, though no further details about the confession, and they are continuing to piece together the timeline of events. Sheriff's department spokesman Aaron Williamson told MailOnline that they are still unsure of what the boy was doing between the hours of 5am- when he reportedly killed his father- to 8pm on Saturday when he drove to their local Calvary Church and told one of the churchgoers. That person then called the police. Mr Williamson said that the investigation is still ongoing but there are no active searches for any other suspects. Filling in the gaps: Sheriff Dan Houston (right) and Lt. Sid Covington (left) said that the teen has been 'very unemotional' throughout his questioning and is currently being held in the local juvenile detention center . He confirmed that all of the weapons- both the .22-calibre rifle and AR-15 military assault rifle that were used to kill the relatives, and the two additional shotguns that Nehemiah had on him when he drove to the church- were all legally owned by his father, former pastor Gregory Griegos. Once taken into custody sometime after 9.15pm on Saturday, Nehemiah told police the gruesome story of how he killed his mother with a .22-caliber rifle because he was 'annoyed with' his mother, and then went on to shoot dead his three younger siblings before taking an AR-15 assault rifle and waiting for hours until his father arrived home so that he could kill him too. Nehemiah Griego is in police custody and the formal statement of probable cause tells how, after reciting several false versions of events, he eventually admitted to killing five of his family members. Lieutenant Sid Covington described Nehemiah as having a 'very stern demeanor, very unemotional' throughout the interrogation. Religious: The boy's father, a former pastor, was thought to be working at a local mission at the time that his wife and three children were killed, and only returned home at around 5am when his son then allegedly shot him . The 15-year-old said that at just after midnight on Saturday he walked into his parent's bedroom where his mother and younger brother were sleeping and took the rifle from his parent's closet. He then shot his mother Sara in the head, and when his 9-year-old brother Zephania awoke and said that he did not believe that she was dead, the police report states that Nehemiah 'picked up his mother's head to show his brother her bloody face.' When Zephania began to cry, Nehemiah shot him dead too before proceeding into the room where his 5-year-old sister Jael and 2-year-old sister Angelina were sleeping. 'Nehemiah stated he lost his sense of . conscience and went to the bedroom his two younger sisters share. Nehemiah stated when he entered he noticed that his sisters were crying . and he shot both of them in the head,' the police report says. Suspected shooter: Nehemiah Griego, 15, was said to regularly wear military camouflage gear around the neighborhood . 'Quiet': Nehemiah was not registered with the school district so he was thought to be home schooled . Mr Williamson said that the working theory is that Mr Griego, 51, worked at one of the local missions, which potentially explains why he was not at home when his son allegedly started firing at around midnight. After allegedly killing his siblings and his mother, he then went back to his parent's closet and grabbed the AR-15 military-style assault rifle that they kept there and then went to wait fro his dad in the downstairs bathroom. When his father arrived at around 5am on Saturday, he waited until his dad had walked past the bathroom so that he was able to shoot him multiple times with the assault rifle. Nehemiah admitted to police that at the time of the shooting he was having homicidal and suicidal thoughts. In a chilling note, he added that there would have been more deaths, telling police that 'after killing five of his family members he reloaded the weapons so that he could drive to a populated area to murder more people.' He said that he expected that he would be killed in a firefight that would likely ensue when he tried to kill others. The timeline of events from that point on appears a little less defined as he admitted to texting a picture of his dead mother to his girlfriend. Tragedy: One of the victims of the shooting was identified as Gregory Griego, pictured center, a former pastor at the Calvary Albuquerque church . Killing: Five people were shot to death at the home in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in the Saturday night shooting . In an earlier story, he told police that he had come home to find his family had been killed, and that he drove to the church with rifles in the trunk of the van in order to protect himself from the potential attacker. In that story, he told his girlfriend about the deaths, and then her grandmother then reported it to the authorities. Nehemiah was arrested after the shooting at his family's Albuquerque home where police found the bodies and they have charged him with two counts of murder, and three counts of child abuse . resulting in death, according to the station. Each of the victims were shot multiple . times, and police found a number of weapons in the house. Nehemiah is believed to be the seventh of Pastor Griego's ten children and because he has no existing records with the county school board, they believe he was home schooled. A neighbor told local news station KRQE that Nehemiah quiet but courteous. Location: The bodies were found at a home on Long Lane Southwest in South Valley, New Mexico . 'He seemed to be a normal kid just walking up and down the road,' said neighbor Jerry Crites. 'He seemed to be a very good kid, he was fairly quiet not real rowdy that we could tell.' One of the only places that Nehemiah . left a trail is online where he lied about his age to make a dating . profile on a site called MeetOne. 'Well I'm a fun loving guy who like . [sic] to make people happy I might be shy but I'll open up once you get . to know me,' he wrote on the site. He wrote that he was 18-years-old, most likely to comply with the site's terms and conditions, and posted a photo of himself in his favorite camouflage fatigues. Family murder: The shooting took place inside the Griego home, and Nehemiah waited there for hours after killing his mother and siblings until his father arrived home from work . House of guns: The boy allegedly used his father's .22 rifle and an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle to shoot his family . Crime scene: Authorities investigate the death of Pastor Gregory Griego and family members at his home on Sunday morning . 'There's no other way to say it, except . that we have a horrific crime scene down there that we are working on,' Sheriff Dan Houston said on Sunday. 'Right . now we're to the meticulous points of processing the scene and . collecting physical evidence, and this is a vast scene with a lot of . physical evidence,' sheriff's department spokesman Sid Covington said. Though little is known about Nehemiah, his father was a recognizable figure in the community and previously served as the pastor at Calvary Albuquerque Church. After spending six years working at the Calvary Chapel in Montebllo, California, Mr Griego moved to New Mexico. Since moving to Albuquerque, he has worked in a number of different outreach capacities for the Christian church, including leading the prison outreach program and leading the group Veterans for Christ.

"Monkeys and apes use loud calls and gestures to make their feelings known but until now, the exact meaning for individual movements has remained a mystery. Now, researchers believe they have translated the key gestures used in the chimp community and deciphered their intentions, for the first time. From 4,351 gestures, experts were able to identify 66 that are used for 19 specific message meanings – including showing a foot to tell a child they can climb on their back, to nibbling a leaf to signal intent to mate. Scroll down for 'dictionary' and video . Researchers from Scotland have translated the key gestures used by chimps. From 4,351 gestures, experts were able to identify 66 that were used for 19 specific message meanings, including hugging the air to ask for an embrace (stock image pictured), and slapping objects together to ask another chimp to follow them . The researchers were able to narrow down these 66 gestures to 36 that are used intentionally to achieve 15 purposes, other than in play. The translations were made by Dr Catherine Hobaiter and her colleagues at St Andrews University in Scotland. Observations were made on chimpanzees within the Sonso community in the Budongo region of the rainforest, in Uganda. During three field periods between October 2007 and August 2009, Dr Hobaiter used focal behaviour sampling and filmed all recorded cases of gestural communication using a Sony Handycam. Other gestures include stomping their feet to ask another chimp to stop what they are doing, and slapping objects together to ask another to follow them. Of the 19 meanings, 17 encouraged interactions to start, such as  ‘groom me’, or to develop, such as ‘move closer,’ and ‘change play’. Recordings taken from 2007 to 2009 in Uganda found that nibbling on a leaf (stock image pictured) signals intent that a chimp is ready to mate . Some of the gestures were found to have more than one meaning, and only 10 of the 66 gestures were used for only a single meaning, and of these, seven were recorded on three or fewer occasions. ‘We can finally say for the first time that another animal communication has meaning; not just information and not just complicated communication, but meaningful communication,’ Dr Hobaiter told BBC News. ‘[Recent] findings about great ape . gestures spurred interest in a potential common ancestral origin with . components of human language. ‘Of . particular interest, given the relevance to language origins, is the . question of what chimpanzees intend their gestures to mean; . surprisingly, the matter of what the intentional signals are used to . achieve has been largely neglected. ‘Here we present the first systematic study of meaning in chimpanzee gestural communication.’ The research is published in the journal Current Biology. In . a separate study, primatologists Emilie Genty and Klaus Zuberbühler . from Switzerland’s University of Neuchâtel wanted to translate a . specific gesture used by bonobos. They discovered that the gesture, which . involves stretching an arm towards another bonobo, sweeping it inwards, . then finishing with a wrist-twirl that turns a downward-facing palm . upwards, is used to initiate sex. The researchers were able to narrow down these 66 gestures to 36 that are used intentionally to achieve 15 purposes, other than in play. For example, when a mother shows their chimp the bottom of their foot (stock image pictured), it tells the child they are allowed to climb on their parent's back . In a separate study, primatologists from Switzerland's University of Neuchâtel wanted to translate a specific gesture used by bonobos. Stretching an arm towards another bonobo, sweeping it inwards, then finishing with a wrist-twirl that turns a downward-facing palm upwards (pictured) is used to initiate sex . Over 222 hours of observation time, the researchers collected a total of 471 video clips from two social groups of bonobos at a sanctuary near Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. They spotted 1,080 sexual solicitations, initiated by 18 males and 17 females. As well as identifying what the gesture means, they also discovered the technique needed to increase the chances of success. When the gestures resulted in sex, the initiator approached from a distance of around 3ft (1 metre) with their back in a concave position. Success also depended on how many other bonobos were present, and if any others were seen as competition. Over 222 hours of observation time, the researchers collected a total of 471 video clips from two social groups of bonobos in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. They spotted 1,080 sexual solicitations, initiated by 18 males and 17 females. This flow chart shows the success to failure rate . ‘Human children use gestures to communicate before they produce their first words, and their earliest gestures are deictic and typically emerge around 10 months of age,' explained the researchers. ‘Iconic gestures therefore seem to be cognitively more demanding than deictic gestures or other conventionalized signals. ‘In great apes, there is good evidence that language-trained individuals are capable of acquiring and understanding both deictic and iconic signals, but this is far less clear in their natural communication. ‘Although we cannot claim with confidence that the beckoning gesture is produced with an understanding of its iconic nature, our findings are relevant in that they provide evidence that great apes can naturally use spatial reference as part of a communicative intention, with recipients responding to such signals appropriately. ‘The ability to produce gestures that depict some spatial features of a desired action was therefore probably already present in the common ancestor of humans and apes.’","Researchers from Scotland studied chimps in Budongo Forest in Uganda .

"A newborn baby pulled from the rubble after an airstrike in Syria destroyed the home she was in is alive and well. Rateb Malis was only 27 days old when a bomb blew up a relative's house in the Duma neighbourhood north-east of Damascus last week. Today, his father, also called Rateb, was pictured with the child and his sister Maria, who was also rescued from under rubble. Survivor: Abu Rateb Malis holds his 27-day-old baby son Rateb Malis, as his daughters (right) pose at a relative's home in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus . The baby was rescued from rubble on January 7 after what activists said was an airstrike by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . The tiny baby wrapped in a blanket is freed from the remains of its home after an air strike carried out by forces loyal to the Syrian leader. He was among the children, their faces covered in thick dust mixed with their own tears, were hauled from the wreckage following the latest bomb attack on Damascus, in which a number of civilians were killed. Witnesses said they had seen military helicopters dropping devastating 'barrel bombs' on residential areas in the Douma district of the city. Men formed a human chain to remove the children from the rubble, as the terrified youngsters cried out in fear, many of them barefoot, their clothes blackened and torn in the blast. Rescue: A man carries baby Rateb, wrapped in a blanket, from the wreckage of his home after what activists say was an airstrike by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad . Innocent: The tiny infant, dressed in a blue baby-grow appeared to have survived the air strike unharmed . Saved: Rateb is lifted high above the heads of rescuers as other children are also carried to safety . Other rescue workers carried the youngsters high above their heads as they desperately tried to carry them to safety. The strike, which activists say was carried out by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, came as the first batch of the most dangerous chemicals in Syria's arsenal were removed from the country after the leader bowed to pressure to hand them over. The chemicals were loaded onto a Danish ship and taken out of the country last week under tight security, an important milestone in the international operation to rid President Assad of the weapons by the middle of the year. The operation at Syria's port of Latakia took place against the backdrop of a widening civil war and escalating infighting between a chaotic mix of Syrian rebel brigades and an Al Qaeda linked militant group, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Terror: Men held an injured boy, whose dust-coated face is streaked with his own tears . Horror: A man desperately tries to take the child to safety . The chemicals were supposed to have been removed from Syria by December 31, but poor security, bad weather and other factors meant the deadline was missed by a week. The raw materials - precursor chemicals for poison gas - were moved to the government-held port of Latakia from two sites in Syria and loaded onto the Danish cargo ship, which then set sail, said Sigrid Kaag, the Dutch diplomat coordinating the joint mission by the UN and Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Security for the highly toxic cargo is being provided by warships from Russia, China, Denmark and Norway. The chemicals will eventually be transferred to a U.S. ship, the Cape Ray, which has been fitted with special machinery. Once aboard the American vessel, the materials will be placed in a titanium reactor that uses heated water and other chemicals to render the weapons inert.

"Devastated residents have been forced to flea their burning homes in Ukraine following mortar attacks in scenes reminiscent of the Eastern Front during the Second World War. Suburban buildings were engulfed in flames and shell craters dotted the ground as strategic positions along the border with Russia were targeted. The image of devastation in Lugansk is a sign of the escalation in military tensions between Kiev and the Kremlin following the end of a 10-day ceasefire. But the pictures, which strongly resemble the trail of destruction left by Hitler's forces in the Soviet Union 70 years ago, are also a worrying sign of how the conflict could develop.

Devastation: Victims stand outside a burning house in the village of Nikolayevka in Lugansk in the aftermath of a mortar attack which left a Ukrainian border guard dead . Trail of destruction: A woman fleas her home in Russia after being set alight by Hitler's forces in 1943 . Ukraine's border guards service says a serviceman was killed and eight were wounded when a post on the border with Russia came under heavy mortar attack. In a statement, the service says the attack took place before dawn Wednesday at the Novoazovsk post in the southeastern part of the Donetsk region. Donetsk is one of two eastern regions where Ukrainian forces are fighting pro-Russia separatists. A 10-day unilateral cease-fire by the Ukrainian side expired late Monday after separatists rejected calls to lay down their weapons. Border posts have become key positions, as Ukraine claims the rebels are receiving support and reinforcements from Russia. It is similar to the strategy used by the Germans in 1941 during Operation Barbossa, the offensive which began a three-year military campaign on the Eastern Front. Homes in the region, which was part of the USSR at the time, were attacked first from the air by the Luftwaffe and then by ground troops. Pictures taken at the time show swathes of villages covered in flames. This week, Ukraine says it retook control of one border post from rebels. The guards service said Wednesday the insurgents had mined the post with explosives. In the wake of the new attacks, foreign ministers from Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France have also agreed on series of steps for a resumption of the cease-fire.

Today, Ukraine is continuing its 'massive artillery and air offensive' against rebels in Donetsk and Lugansk regions amid unconfirmed claims of heavy casualties among insurgents. But separatists have already claimed to have shot down a Sukhoi Su-27 over Luganskaya village in Lugansk region. Yesterday, fighting resumed in the country after Kiev President Petro Poroshenko refused to extend a shaky ten-day ceasefire in the conflict with rebels, vowing: 'We will attack'. At the same time, Putin claimed he could not dictate to the . pro-Moscow insurgents to lay down their arms, with his spokesman . declaring: 'Russia's influence on the militia should not be . overestimated.' Shortly after Poroshenko ended the ceasefire, a five-hour gunbattle erupted in eastern Ukraine's largest city, resulting in the Interior Ministry headquarters falling to pro-Russia separatists. The cease-fire had given European leaders 10 days to search for a peaceful settlement, and its end raised the prospect that fighting could flare with new intensity in a conflict that has already killed more than 400 people since April. In Donetsk, the capital of Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland, streets were deserted and gunfire filled the air yesterday as rebels besieged the Interior Ministry building. The rebels eventually captured the compound, leaving the body of a undercover police officer on the street outside.

Reaction: The man is told 'someone will call the police if you carry on doing that to someone', before a passer-by says to the woman: 'You don't have to put up with that honey, he's not worth it' The experiment is then conducted with the same actors - but this time, the woman is the aggressor, attacking him and saying: ‘Don't try to walk away - listen to me when I'm talking to you.’ However, instead of reacting with shock, nobody watching even attempts to help the man. They actually seem rather entertained by the incident, stopping to stare and laughing about it. The videos were filmed with three hidden cameras on May 16 for the ManKind Initiative, a charity based in Taunton, Somerset, which aims to provide support for male victims of domestic abuse. The clip was made just days after multi-millionaire rap mogul Jay Z was punched and kicked by his wife Beyoncé’s sister Solange Knowles during a violent confrontation in a lift in New York.

The charity claims 38 per cent of domestic abuse victims are male. About 7.1 per cent of women and 4.4 per cent of men were estimated to have experienced domestic abuse in the last year. It said statistics have also revealed that more married men and cohabitating men suffered from partner abuse in 2012/13 than married women and cohabitating women.","Video filmed with hidden cameras shows male actor attacking 'girlfriend'

"In a rare outreach to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, President Barack Obama has written a letter about the fight against Islamic State militants - a development that sparked uproar in some congressional circles. The US and Iran are each engaged in military efforts to degrade the Islamic State group, essentially putting the longtime foes on the same side in the campaign against the extremists. However, the Obama administration has repeatedly insisted that it is not coordinating and will not coordinate its military actions with Iran, though officials from both countries have discussed the matter more broadly. Secret communique: President Barack Obama (left) has written a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (right) about the fight against Islamic State militants . In reaction to the secret missive from the commander-in-chief, a senior congressional source told Fox News that it could damage America’s fledgling relationship with Sunni-led states in the region. ‘This f***s up everything,’ the source put in bluntly, adding that the president should have informed Congress about his diplomatic efforts. Obama's letter to Iran's powerful religious leader comes against the backdrop of the looming November 24 deadline in nuclear negotiations between the US and Iran, as well as five other world powers. While Obama has previously sent three letters to Khamenei, any communication between the two men has been extremely rare. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported that Obama had sent the letter, said it described a shared interest between the US and Iran in fighting Islamic State militants and stressed that any cooperation on that would be largely contingent on Iran agreeing to the nuclear deal. However, while not confirming nor denying the existence of the letter, administration officials said there were still no plans to cooperate or coordinate with Iran against the militants. ‘The United States will not cooperate militarily with Iran in that effort,’ White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. ‘We won't share intelligence with them.’ Diplomatic sources separately confirmed the existence of the letter to The Associated Press. They did so on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss Obama's outreach. Obama authorized a US-led air campaign against Islamic State fighters in Iraq in August and expanded the mission the following month to neighboring Syria. The US is taking action alongside several other nations, including a handful of regional partners. Iran is not part of the US coalition, but it has also been fighting the Islamic State group on the ground. Obama's letter reportedly described a shared interest between the US and Iran in fighting Islamic State militants. Pictured above is an ISIS fighter in the countryside of the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobani in October . Pen pal: Obama has previously sent three letters to Khamenei, pictured here in September lying in bed at a hospital in Teheran recovering from prostate surgery . However, Iran's interests in pursuing the Islamic State's defeat differ from those of the Obama administration. Iran is a staunch supporter of Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is a target of the militants and opposed by the US . Two chief critics of Obama's foreign policy, GOP Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, called it ‘outrageous’ that Obama would seek to enlist Iran in its fight against IS given Iran's support for Assad and Shia extremists throughout the region. ‘The consequences of this ill-conceived bargain would destroy the Syrians' last, best chance to live in freedom from the brutal Assad regime,’ the two senators said in a joint statement. House Speaker John Boehner, asked in a separate briefing about the reported letter, said he did not trust Iran's leaders and did not think they should be brought into the fight against Islamic State. US officials have not ruled out the possibility that a nuclear accord with Iran could open the door to discussions on other issues, but they have sought to keep the delicate negotiations focused solely on Tehran's disputed nuclear program. The US and its negotiating partners say Iran is pursuing a bomb, while Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. The prospects for a final agreement remain uncertain, with Obama saying on Wednesday that the ability to secure a deal is an ‘open question.’ Stern critics: GOP Sens. John McCain of Arizona (left) and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina (right) called it ‘outrageous’ that Obama would seek to enlist Iran in its fight against IS . The technical details of the talks have been closely guarded by the negotiating partners — the US, Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and Iran. The broad parameters of a potential agreement include Iran cutting back on its number of centrifuges enriching uranium and redesigning a planned heavy water reactor so it doesn't produce plutonium. Both materials can be used in nuclear warheads. In exchange, the US in particular would have to roll back some of the financial, trade and oil sanctions that significantly cut off Iran from global markets. The US and Iran broke off diplomatic relations in 1979 after the Islamic revolution and the storming of the US Embassy in Tehran, where 52 Americans were held hostage for more than a year. However, the relationship began to thaw after Obama took office, particularly following the election last year of a more moderate-sounding Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani. US and Iranian officials held a series of secret meetings last year that ultimately paved the way for the resumption of international nuclear negotiations. Obama and Rouhani also held a historic phone call last fall, the first direct communication between their nation's leaders since the Islamic revolution. However, the two men have not spoken since and skipped the opportunity to meet face-to-face while attending UN General Assembly meetings in New York in September. Despite Rouhani's standing as president, US officials believe Khamenei, the powerful supreme leader, has the ultimate say in whether Iran reaches a nuclear deal with world powers.","The president reportedly wrote the letter to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in October .

"Levi Strauss CEO Chip Bergh has revealed that he hasn't washed his favorite pair of jeans for a year. The 56-year-old arrived at Fortune magazine’s Brainstorm Green conference on Monday in California wearing the dark denim pants, which he admitted were 'yet to see a washing machine.' He continued telling the crowd of business leaders gathered: 'I know that sounds totally disgusting, I know it does . . . [But] I have yet to get a skin disease or anything else.' Scroll down for video . Saving water: Levi's CEO Chip Bergh (left) revealed that he hadn't washed his jeans for a year at Fortune's business conference on Monday - the magazine's magazine editor, Andy Sewer (right) looked a little disgusted . Asked how often people should be washing their jeans, Mr Bergh replied 'not very often.' He added that 'real denim aficionados' never put their threads near soap and water. Instead he recommends simply dabbing stains with a sponge or using a toothbrush for more stubborn marks. Andy Sewer, . Fortune's managing editor who interviewed Mr Bergh, looked a little . disgusted at his revelation, although he admitted the tight-fitting . pants looked 'pretty good.' Spreading the word: The 56-year-old told the crowd of business leaders gathered: 'I know that sounds totally disgusting. I know it does . . . [But] I have yet to get a skin disease or anything else' Steeped in history: Mr Bergh became the CEO of Levi Strauss in 2011 - the company celebrated the 141st birthday of its 501 jeans this week and is now striving to create more sustainable products . Tags on Levi Strauss jeans urge customers to wash less and use only cold water. Mr Bergh isn't the only one ditching the wash cycle. Last year, Tommy Hilfiger also revealed that he 'never' washes his jeans - his favorite brand being Levi Strauss over his own eponymous label. The 63-year-old told a TMZ reporter: 'I never wash my Levi's. They'll fall apart. I love them broken in.' And TV anchor Anderson Cooper told how he wears the same jeans every day, washing them on average only four times a year. He admitted that he also had an unconventional method of cleaning his jeans: wearing them in the shower. 'So the times I've washed my jeans, maybe twice in six months . . . I've worn them and walked into my shower with them and put some soap on them and then air dried them.' Levi Strauss celebrated the 141st birthday of its 501 jeans on Tuesday. The California-based company is now striving to create denim products that last longer and require less washing in a bid to promote sustainability. In 2011, Levis Strauss introduced a stone-washed denim brand smoothed with rocks but no water, its cleaning instructions urging customers to wash their jeans rarely, if at all, and put them in the freezer instead. Freeze cleaning doesn’t remove dirt or dust, and certainly does not remove stains, but it does kill the germs that cause jeans to smell. Levis advises customers to put jeans in a plastic, zip-lock bag and put them in the freezer for 24 hours. And according to a student-professor team that tested a pair of jeans at the University of Alberta, wearing raw denim jeans for 15 months without washing them does not pose any health risks. Josh Le, 20, bought a pair of Nudie Jeans in 2009 and wore them nearly every day, even sleeping in them for a month and spilled food on them (wiped off with a paper towel). But when Mr Le and assistant human ecology professor Rachel McQueen swabbed the inside of the jeans and tested them for bacteria 15 months later, they found levels to be normal. Mr Le then washed the jeans, wore them for 13 days, and re-tested them. The bacteria levels were nearly identical.",Chip Bergh arrived at Fortune magazine's Brainstorm Green conference on Monday wearing the unwashed dark denim pants .
"UNEMPLOYMENT in the crisis-torn single currency bloc has reached a record high of nearly 19.5million, figures showed yesterday. Statistics agency Eurostat said the number out of work in the eurozone rose by 996,000 in the 12 months to the end of September. The jobless rate hit an all-time high of 12.5 per cent in Italy while more than half of Greeks and Spaniards under the age of 25 who want work cannot find a job. Unemployed: People waiting in line at a government employment office in Madrid. The number of unemployed in the 17-nation eurozone reached a record high in September as the bloc's nascent recovery failed to generate jobs, official data revealed today . Though the unemployment rate remained steady at 12.2 percent, the previous month was revised up from 12 percent. A sharp and unexpected drop in inflation also cast doubts over the recovery of the eurozone, which just emerged from recession, and put pressure on the European Central Bank to act. Doubts: A sharp and unexpected drop in inflation also cast doubts over the recovery of the eurozone . The euro dropped from above $1.3700 to about $1.3640 in midday trading. The ECB has already cut its key interest rate to a record low to spur lending. But banks, companies and households are still too afraid to lend or borrow money. The ECB may be pushed into action eventually if the inflation rate keeps dropping. Eurostat said the annual inflation rate fell to 0.7 percent in October from 1.1 percent a month earlier, marking its lowest level in about four years. The ECB is tasked with keeping inflation close to, but below 2 percent. 'Latest developments reinforce our view that the ECB will end up cutting interest rates from 0.5 percent to 0.25 percent sooner or later,' said IHS Global Insight's analyst Howard Archer, adding the ECB might take such action as early as in December. While other analysts think a rate decrease is unlikely in coming months - not least because of resistance from powerful ECB players such as Germany's central bank - the ECB still has other means at its disposal. It can, among other things, provide more cheap loans to banks to improve their finances and encourage them to lend. It already issued such loans three times, helping stabilize the financial system, and ECB President Mario Draghi hinted several times in recent months that the central bank might consider issuing another round. A particularly gloomy stat was youth unemployment - it rose to 24.1 percent from 24 percent in August. It was lowest in Germany and Austria, with 7.7 percent and 8.7 percent, and highest in Europe's southern economies, which have been hit hard by the debt crisis and government austerity measures.

Protests: People with physical disabilities participate in a protest against cuts to their pensions and medical treatment as part of anti-austerity measures in Athens this morning . Changes: S&P Dow Jones Indices, said that Greece no longer classifies as a developed market, reported Greek Reporter . They were around 57 percent in Greece and 56 percent in Spain. The overall unemployment rate showed similar disparities. Germany and Austria had low rates of 5 percent. By contrast, joblessness was 26.6 percent in Spain. In Greece, where the latest figures available were for July - it stood at 27.6 percent. The unemployment rate for the wider 28-nation European Union remained unchanged in September at 11 percent. S&P Dow Jones Indices, said that Greece no longer classifies as a developed market, reported Greek Reporter. The . general consensus among participants is that emerging market status is a . more appropriate classification due to the reasons including failing a . minimum credit ratings criteria, and dramatic and consistent reduction . in market size over the past few years.

Hit back: Angela Merkel's conservatives today rejected U.S. criticism of Germany's dependence on exports but her likely future coalition partner agreed Europe's bulwark economy must do more to spur domestic demand . The United States has long called for countries like China and Germany with trade surpluses to do more to spur imports but the Obama administration's reprimand in a semi-annual report to Congress on Wednesday stood out for its stark language. Both Merkel's conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats, who are in talks to form a coalition government after a September election, retorted that Germany would continue to strive to be competitive globally. 'We have always been a strong export country and we are proud of that,' said Ilse Aigner, the conservatives' lead negotiator in coalition talks for economic issues. The U.S. criticism comes at a tricky juncture in relations between Washington and Berlin. German envoys met the White House national security adviser in Washington on Wednesday after reports the United States monitored Merkel's cellphone. Germany argues that it has more than halved its trade surplus within the euro zone as a share of GDP since 2007. Trade is expected to subtract rather than contribute to economic growth this year, with imports outpacing exports, while domestic demand, albeit still weak, will drive growth.","Number of unemployed in eurozone reached a record high in September .

"Former first lady Jackie Kennedy is said to have made the tapes within months of JFK's assassination . Jackie Onassis believed that Lyndon B Johnson and a cabal of Texas tycoons were involved in the assassination of her husband John F Kennedy, ‘explosive’ recordings are set to reveal. The secret tapes will show that the former first lady felt that her husband’s successor was at the heart of the plot to murder him. She became convinced that the then vice president, along with businessmen in the South, had orchestrated the Dallas shooting, with gunman Lee Harvey Oswald – long claimed to have been a lone assassin – merely part of a much larger conspiracy. Texas-born Mr Johnson, who served as the state’s governor and senator, completed Mr Kennedy’s term and went on to be elected president in his own right. The tapes were recorded with leading historian Arthur Schlesinger Jnr within months of the assassination on November 22, 1963, and had been sealed in a vault at the Kennedy Library in Boston. The then Mrs Kennedy, who went on to marry Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis, had ordered that they should not be released until  50 years after her death, with some reports suggesting she feared that her revelations might make her family targets for revenge. She died 17 years ago from cancer aged 64 and now her daughter, Caroline Kennedy, has agreed to release the recordings early.

House intern, with his wife even claiming that she found knickers in . their bedroom. And they go on to reveal that she too . had affairs – one with Hollywood star William Holden and another with . Fiat founder Gianni Agnelli – as a result of the president’s . indiscretions. It has also been claimed that, in the weeks before Mr . Kennedy’s assassination, the couple had turned a corner in their . relationship and were planning to have more children. Historian Edward Klein, who has . written several books on the Kennedy clan, said: ‘Jackie regarded the . pretty young things in the White House as superficial flings for Jack. She did retaliate by having her own affairs. ‘There was a period during which she was delighted to be able to annoy her husband with her own illicit romances.’ It is believed that Caroline, 53, . agreed to the early release of the tapes in exchange for ABC dropping . its £10million drama series about the family. The Kennedys, starring Tom Cruise’s . wife Katie Holmes as Jackie, critically charted the family’s political . and personal trials and tribulations since the 1930s.

"A guest at Silvio Berlusconi’s ‘bunga bunga’ parties has told an Italian court of her ‘shock and embarrassment’ at the former leader’s actions. Melania Tumini, 26, described an evening at Berlusconi’s villa in August 2010 as ‘a gathering of whores’, adding: ‘The girls were allowing themselves to be touched by the prime minister. ‘Some of the women were dressed in nurses’ outfits while others were in police uniforms. Accused: Nicole Minetti looks on during a break of a trial in Milan's court, where she is standing trial accused of recruiting women for Berlusconi's parties . 'I kept saying I had  to go to the bathroom or go outside and smoke a cigarette. I was shocked and embarrassed by the scenes I saw.’ Miss Tumini’s former friend Nicole Minetti is accused of recruiting women for the parties, while Berlusconi himself is accused of paying for sex with a belly-dancer when she was just 17. Berlusconi, 74, is said to have invited dozens of models and TV wannabes to his home where they stripped off and performed erotic pole dances for him and two of his sidekicks. The women were paid with cash, jewellery and cars with those who chose to stay the night being paid even more, according to earlier witnesses. Allegations: Nicole Minetti, left, denies the allegations, while Berlusconi, right, also refutes accusations of paying for sex with a belly-dancer when she was just 17 .

When she was asked by prosecutors if the parties were ‘burlesque’ as Berlusconi had described them last month Miss Tumini said: ’No' before confirming a telephone transcript in which she had told friends: ’The parties were like a gathering of whores.’ Miss Minetti is accused of recruiting women for Berlusconi’s parties along with two others, showbuisness agent Lele Mora, 55, and TV news anchorman Emilio Fede, 80. Claims: Dancer Karima El Mahroug of Morocco, who was allegedly paid by Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi for sex . Miss Tumini also added that when she left the party at Berlusconi’s villa at Arore near Milan, he had given her a CD of his latest album of love songs and four 500 Euro banknotes. In a separate and ongoing trial Berlusconi is accused of paying for sex with a minor, belly dancer Karima El Mahroug, who was just 17 at the time of the parties. In Italy the age of consent is 14 but paying a woman below the age of 18 for sex is seen as underage prostiution and punishable by up to three years in jail. Both deny any wrong doing and Berlusconi has insisted the parties were simply elegant dinners where there was ‘eating, talking and dancing’. Both trials have been adjourned until later this month.

"A 'miracle' transplant patient died after junior doctors failed to spot she was suffering organ rejection, her family have claimed. Hannah Pudsey, 24, received media attention in 2001 after a six month wait for a new heart - at the time, the longest wait any British child in need of an organ had been forced to endure. Her story inspired thousands of people to become potential organ donors but Ms Pudsey died on February 1 last year, after she was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis that was hiding another problem with her heart. Hannah Pudsey, pictured during her engagement photoshoot, died in February last year, just a month before her wedding. Doctors diagnosed her with diabetic ketoacidosis, but this was hiding another problem with her heart . An inquest heard that a trainee registrar at Hull Royal Infirmary failed to read a letter from Ms Pudsey's GP detailing her complex medical history and therefore did not to treat her as a priority patient. Hannah, who was five months away from marrying her boyfriend Kevin Preston, could have been sent to a High Dependency Unit, but instead, the inquest in Hull heard she was left for hours between blood tests. In a statement read out at the inquest, Hannah’s mother, Ros Pudsey said: 'Hannah was seen by a junior doctor in the morning and transferred at 12.30pm to a diabetes ward. 'She was not seen by anyone senior on that ward until 4pm. By that time her condition had deteriorated. I was concerned that the care she was given was not sufficient. Her mother explains that she called for a doctor at 6pm when her daughter 'screamed out for oxygen' before collapsing. Ms Pudsey received media attention in 2001 (pictured then, aged 12) after a six month wait before she received a new heart. At the time it was the longest wait any child in Britain with a heart defect had experienced . Ros Pudsey said: 'If Hull Royal Infirmary had acted earlier on in the day, maybe Hannah would have survived. We feel she could have survived that day.' Ms Pudsey, who was given just six months to live when she was 13 after being born with two holes in her heart, was given a new lease of life thanks to her heart transplant, which allowed her to go to school, pass her driving test, get a job and meet her fiance. She developed type 1 diabetes in 2008, believed to be as a result of drugs she took to minimise the risk of organ rejection. Ms Pudsey, of Driffield, East Yorkshire, had visited her GP on the morning she died complaining of severe nausea, which she had been suffering from for several days. Her GP called for an ambulance and Hannah was taken to the A&E department with suspected gastroenteritis. Ms Pudsey, pictured with fiance Kevin Preston, developed type 1 diabetes in 2008, believed to be as a result of the anti-rejection drugs she took. She visited her GP on the morning she died, complaining of severe nausea . Trainee registrar Dr Kanchan Manchegowda was given details of Ms Pudsey’s medical history but told the hearing she failed to read the notes. Hospital staff believed Ms Pudsey was suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis, caused by a lack of insulin and she was transferred to ward 10, while staff investigated possible causes. When asked by Coroner Professor Paul Marks if Dr Manchegowda would have acted on Ms Pudsey as a matter of urgency, if she had read the letter, she replied 'Maybe, yes.' Dr Manchegowda continued: 'I didn’t get a chance to look at the information, as I was also dealing with another patient who was also suffering from a cardiac arrest. I was unaware that Hannah had been moved from the A&E department to Ward 10. Ms Pudsey, pictured at her 21st birthday with boyfriend Mr Preston, called for an ambulance and was taken to A&E with suspected gastroenteritis. Trainee registrar Dr Kanchan Manchegowda was given details of Ms Pudsey¿s medical history but told a hearing she failed to read the notes . 'Hannah did not complain about any heart problems to me. She was initially responding to treatment and heading in the right direction.' Dr Jane Patmore, a consultant physician at Hull Royal Infirmary, raised her concerns over her staff’s actions. 'The first decision we made was the wrong one. When staff diagnosed the diabetic ketoacidosis, it was, at best, only part of the issue,' Dr Patmore said. 'If Hannah’s admittance to hospital was purely down to the ketoacidosis, then Ward 10 would have been correct. 'However, my concern is that we set off down a different pathway before we could identify any other issues. Had we identified these, such as the cardiac rejection, we would have taken a different path, and that maybe would have been the High Dependency Unit.' Staff at Hull Royal Infirmary Hospital (pictured) believed Ms Pudsey was suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis, caused by a lack of insulin. From the examinations conducted in A&E, and by the registrar, doctors found no evidence of heart failure . Dr Patmore said a clinician with her own level of expertise and experience may have identified both causes of Miss Pudsey’s illness. But when asked by the coroner if a consultant cardiologist should have been alerted straight away, Dr Patmore replied: 'Retrospect is a wonderful thing. It’s clear from the examinations conducted in A&E and by the registrar that they found no evidence of heart failure. On that basis, I would not have jumped to the consultant cardiologist'. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a dangerous complication of diabetes caused by a lack of insulin in the body. It occurs when the body is unable to use blood sugar (glucose) because there isn't enough insulin. Instead, it breaks down fat as an alternative source of fuel. This causes a build-up of a by-product called ketones. Symptoms include passing large amounts of urine, feeling very thirsty, vomiting and abdominal pain. If the condition is diagnosed very early, it may be possible to relieve the symptoms with an insulin injection. Those with advanced diabetic ketoacidosis must be admitted to hospital where they will be given a combination of insulin and fluids. High levels of ketones in the blood disrupt normal working of many parts of the body. The more ketones in the blood, the more ill a person with diabetic ketoacidosis will become. Left untreated, diabetic ketoacidosis can cause potentially fatal complications, such as severe dehydration, coma and swelling of the brain. Source: NHS Choices . Dr Patmore made clear the treatment would have been similar had Miss Pudsey been transferred to the High Dependency Unit. She said the cause of death should be recorded as metabolic acidosis, which occurs when the body produces too much acid or when the kidneys are not removing enough acid, along with heart rejection. Despite a written apology from Phil Morley, chief executive of Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, for 'unacceptable mistakes and errors', the coroner concluded there were no 'missed opportunities'. Recording a verdict of natural causes, he gave the cause of death as metabolic acidosis and cardiac rejection. 'Admittance to the High Dependency Unit and a discussion with a cardiologist may have made a difference to the outcome, but we are unable to say for definite,' Professor Marks said. 'Thus I am persuaded that there have been no missed opportunities which may have changed the outcome. 'I am satisfied that the trust initiated the appropriate measures and that there is no ongoing failure in the system. Hannah was a much loved woman who wanted to live a normal life and had succeeded in that.' Ros, who lives with husband, Hannah’s father David, said after the case: 'In view of Phil Morley’s previous statements to say that he was sorry for the unacceptable mistakes that they made, I do feel we have some closure and we need to move on in our lives and start to try and rebuild it. 'I don’t feel that she was given the best quality care. 'I was very proud of Hannah. She was absolutely fantastic and she fought for what she believed in. She supported transplantation. 'It isn’t a cure, but she believed that everyone deserved a chance and she just wanted to live her life every day to the full.'","Hannah Pudsey received attention in 2001 after a six month wait for a heart .

"German detectives have arrested a man suspected of spying for the United States in what could prove the 'biggest scandal involving a German-American double agent since the Second World War'. The 31-year-old German citizen was being questioned today on suspicion of snooping on Germany's parliamentary inquiry into the NSA affair. According to one German newspaper, he was first arrested amid suspicions he tried to make contact with Russian intelligence, only to confess he was in fact spying for the Americans. Scroll down for video . Double agent: German authorities would not go into any details as to the identity of the man except that he worked for the BND intelligence service, Germany's equivalent to MI6 (pictured: radomes that contain radar antennas stand at an operating facility of the BND, for whom the suspect works) 'The matter is serious, that is very clear,' a German government spokesman told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. German authorities would not go into any details as to the identity of the man except that he worked for the BND intelligence service, Germany's equivalent to MI6. However, German media launched into a fever of speculation today as to who he was and what he was allegedly doing. Bild reported that the suspected mole was a double agent for the Americans for two years and passed them 218 secret documents in exchange for €25,000, including at least three documents related to the Bundestag NSA enquiry.

"The woolly jumper brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'parrot fashion'. But Charlie isn't merely trying to stand out from the flock. He was given the outfit to help him recover after he was starved for so long that he resorted to plucking his own feathers and eating them. Still he liked the bespoke jumper so much that new owner Rebecca Blagg knitted him four more in different colours. Wrapped up warm: Fashionista Charlie in one of his five bespoke jumpers . And like a true fashionista, the green Eclectus parrot throws a tantrum if he is forced to change - stamping his feet, flapping his wings and squawking. ‘He goes mad. He gets very, very agitated,’ she said. ‘The first summer after we had him it was red hot and I thought he was going to melt with his woolly on. I took it off and he started to go bonkers. I put it back on and he just calmed down straight away! ‘He went in a real grump, so after a while we just gave up trying. It’s like his comfort blanket.’ Mrs Blagg, 47, who is an area co-ordinator for the Safe Haven parrot rescue centre, took Charlie into her home after hearing about his poor health when rescued. A peck on the cheek: Charlie with his owner Rebecca Blagg who created his wardrobe of jumpers . His condition was so weak that he couldn’t sit on his perch without falling off. At first, she waited for his feathers to grow back, but decided in the meantime to knit him five woollen cardigans - one blue, green, white and yellow - to keep him warm. Mrs Blagg, who lives in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, said his favourite cardigan is the yellow one. She added: ‘I am quite tough but when I saw him I burst into tears. It was so sad. The worse abuse case I’ve seen. ‘He had plucked himself. He had been eating his feathers to survive. He was at death’s door. I just wanted to give him a chance. ‘He was extremely shut down. He was very depressed. He wouldn’t move or do anything, he just sat there. ‘We had to feed him with a spoon because he couldn’t eat on his own and he couldn’t even perch because he was too weak. He just fell off. He was black and blue from falling off with his previous owner.’ Mrs Blagg finds homes for parrots across the country and currently has 16 in her home and 100 in the garden.","Charlie was given a woolly sweater to help him keep warm .

"From the forest elephants of Africa, to India’s tigers and even our own great white sharks, wildlife is losing the battle for survival all over the world. Human activity has been blamed for the plummet in numbers, as the United States reports dwindling populations of bumblebees and polar bears - and one of the world's biggest decreases in sealife. Our ever-growing need for land and resources, coupled with hunting and poaching, has halved the number of wild animals in world in just 40 years, according to a shocking report. The Living Planet Report by WWF and the Zoological Society of London has found that wildlife populations around the globe have declined by 52 per cent on average since 1970. The authors compiled data on 10,380 animal populations, including 3,038 different species, as an index to judge how global wildlife is faring as a whole. In the US, fish have decreased by 83 per cent between 1970 and 2010 - the second largest drop after Latin America which lost 86 per cent in the same period. American amphibians have also struggled in the modern world, with an overall decline of 73 per cent recorded, while the total number of reptiles dropped by 48 per cent nationwide. The great white shark is one of the United States' worst-affected species, having lost around 50 per cent of its population in just 20 years, largely due to oil spills in the ocean. Endangered: The population of great white sharks has decreased by around 50 per cent in just 20 years due to a number of factors including oil spills in the ocean . Worldwide problem: The common sight of monarch butterflies could soon be a distant memory as the population has plummeted almost 90 per cent in just 20 years . Little brown bats continue to plummet in numbers due to white-nose syndrome, which has killed seven million since 2006. In some states, the population has decreased by 99 per cent. The syndrome infects the bat's body causing its organs to go cold and its heart to slow. Experts are still struggling to determine the cause. The number of rusty-patched bumblebees - crucial pollinators - haven disappeared from 87 per cent of their territory in the past 25 years, and monarch butterflies are down 90 per cent in the same period. The global picture is worst for freshwater creatures such as amphibians, river fish and mammals, with average population declines of 76 per cent between 1970 and 2010, says the latest data available. Land-dwelling animals declined by 39 per cent over the same period and sea creatures fell 39 per cent, the report found. The authors said the main threats to wildlife are loss or damage to their habitat and exploitation through hunting and fishing. Closer to home: Animals are dying out across the United States too, including the mountain yellow-legged frog, which has been threatened by farming on its habitat . Crucial: The rusty-patched bumblebee is a key pollinator in the ecosystem but it has disappeared from 87% of its territories due to disease and pesticides . They also warned that humans are using resources faster than the planet can provide, cutting down forests too quickly, overfishing and pumping out pollution faster than the world can cope with it. Around 3.9 planets-worth of land and resources would be needed to sustain the typical American lifestyle as it is today for an extended period of time. Kuwaitis had the biggest ecological footprint, meaning they consume and waste more resources per head than any other nation, the report said, followed by Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. America came eighth in the list, behind Denmark, Belgium, Trinidad and Tobago, and Singapore. Professor Ken Norris, director of science at Zoological Society of London (ZSL), said: ‘The scale of biodiversity loss and damage to the very ecosystems that are essential to our existence is alarming. This damage is not inevitable, but a consequence of the way we choose to live.’ David Nussbaum, chief executive of WWF-UK, said: ‘The scale of destruction highlighted in this report should be a wake-up call to us all. We all have an interest, and a responsibility, to act to ensure we protect what we all value: a healthy future for both people and nature.’ Under the sea: The threat to our wildlife is not just limited to land animals - the short-nosed common dolphin and leatherback turtle are also dying out . Mr Nussbaum said consumers could reduce their impact on wildlife by choosing products which were sustainable, for example fish with the Marine Stewardship Council and timber with the Forest Stewardship Council certifications. He said that they could also look at reducing their meat and dairy consumption. Professor Jonathan Baillie, director of conservation programmes at ZSL, said people should think about everything they do, from recycling to putting pressure on political and industry leaders, and getting their children outside to reconnect with nature.","Mankind's need for land and resources, combined with hunting and poaching, are causing our wild animals to die out .

Many also claim to have changed their partner more often than they had changed some appliances - nearly a third had a fridge, toaster or washing machine that had outlasted several relationships. The research into people’s use of technology in the home was conducted by Hotpoint as part of their study into the nation’s Home IQ. 'As technology evolves so do our appliances and as a result the way we live day to day changes too,' said a Hotpoint spokesman. 'The list of life-changing products shows the way our routines, social time and quality of life is altered by the things we surround ourselves with and certain purchases have us wondering how we ever lived without them. 'The results showed that, despite being such a crucial part of our daily lives, many of us have several appliances that are currently broken or not fully functioning. 'This means our homes are performing far below the level they could be both in terms of being more eco-friendly and less costly to run.' Broadband was deemed the biggest life changer, beating the original introduction of the internet and its original dial-up format, which came in second on the list of things people said changed their lives forever. Others said the switch to HDTV was a clear-cut choice, while the ability to print things off at home and drive with the aid of satnav was also praised. The addition of hair straighteners to their beauty repertoire was important for women, while the first upgrade from a regular mobile to an iPhone was deemed an important moment by all. The research also showed the impact of domestic appliances on modern British life and found the average home has three major appliances that are currently broken or only partly functioning. Many also claimed to have changed their partner more often than they had changed some appliances - nearly a third had a fridge, toaster or washing machine that had outlasted several relationships.

The addition of hair straighteners (stock image shown) to their beauty repertoire was important for women, while the first upgrade from a regular mobile to an iPhone was deemed an important moment by all. The research also showed the impact of domestic appliances on modern British life . Interestingly, a fifth of Britons care more about how their home appliances look than what they can do and just three in ten felt they had any appliances that could be deemed the ‘latest’ smart technology. Dishwashers, washing machines and printers were the items people were most likely to say were on the blink but had yet to upgrade. And the different spending priorities of Britons emerged as a clear factor in the results - a fifth of those surveyed had changed their car in the last year. But when it came to appliances, just 16 per cent could say they felt their home was ‘up to date’. When scoring their homes on how their appliances and items performed compared to the available options, the average Brit scored six out of ten. Piero Pracchi, Marketing Director for Hotpoint added: 'Keeping our homes performing efficiently not only saves us money in the long run but it can also enhance our lifestyles by utilising the latest advances in technology.' Hotpoint has also teamed up with BBC F1 presenter Suzi Perry, previously a co-host of Channel 5's The Gadget Show, to help make people’s homes 'smarter' and more efficient. Speaking about the campaign she said: 'If we embraced innovation in our appliances as we do our smartphones and televisions, we would not only expand what we can do within the home but save precious time and money in the process.'

"If you were described as average-looking, you probably wouldn't see it as a compliment. But perhaps you would be happy if you looked like any of these computer-generated depictions of the 'average woman'. With flawless skin, youthful faces and bright eyes - these average faces of women from around the world are nothing short of beautiful. The face of the average woman from a variety of countries including England, China and Central Africa has been deduced by scientists . Hundreds of images of women's faces were laid on top of each other before a computer programme created the average around a focal point of their eyes . They were created from hundreds of pictures of women from all over the world. Using a face-averaging tool hosted online by experimental psychologists at University of Glasgow, women from 41 different nationalities and ethnicities were used for the experiment. The tool is a modern version of the technique . that anthropologist Sir Francis Galton pioneered in the late 19th century, multiple images were carefully laid over one another using a computer technology. Using the eyes of the women as a focus, it then worked out the average look of each woman from every region but analysing their faces. The method - called 'composite portraiture' - and was first used in the 1880s by Sir Francis Galton. The . social scientist and cousin of Charles Darwin first created the image . of the average face by superimposing multiple portraits of . individuals. Some have been critical of the average images, saying - as the results all appear to be around 20 years old - they do not reflect any age range within a country . Those behind the project say that the method averages the shape of the features before blending the images together - hence why there are no blemishes or imperfections . The technique has been used ever since, particularly in the study of 'attractiveness' - which studies people's perception of beauty. However, the results have attracted some controversy - with many saying the results do not reflect reality especially as the 'common' faces are all beautiful. While many agree that it does make sense the women are all pretty - because averages rule out blemishes - many are perplexed that the women all seem to be in her early twenties -  not the average age of any nationality. Those behind the project say that many of the criticisms are explained by the process. Instead . of having a lot of blurry images with undefined features, they say the . method averages the shape of the features before blending the images . together. Some anomalies can be explained by how . the pictures were compiled. The prevalence of mousy hair is a result of . blondeness being easily 'diluted'. Other results also suggest that the study has a few imperfections. The . average South African, for example, should not be pale-skinned as only . 9.2 per cent of the population define themselves as white. The project was inspired by South African photographer Mike Mike's project called The Face of Tomorrow and used techniques developed by social scientist Francis Galton . The project was inspired by the work of South African photographer Mike Mike - who created a web project several years ago called The Face of Tomorrow. The project saw the photographer compile a collection of people's faces from various cities for a final project while he was studying at Goldsmith's University in London. He said: 'Sitting on the underground train, I was intrigued by the sheer diversity of the place – Somalis, Indians, Americans, Zimbabweans, Scandinavians and a hundred other nationalities vying for their place in the metropolis.

"A US actor has pleaded guilty to stealing $7,000 of jewelry and electronics from a friend's apartment. Parker Bagley, 23, who is best known for playing the original Jason DeLaurentis in teen drama Pretty Little Liars, was charged in January after stealing two iPads, a BlackBerry, an iPod, three necklaces and a bracelet from the apartment in Murray Hill, Manhattan. The actor had been told he could stay overnight in the apartment in East 34th Street in October. But when his female friend later returned to her apartment, Bagley was gone along with several thousand dollars worth of jewelry and electrical goods. Pretty Little Liars actor Parker Bagley, left, pictured outside Manhattan Criminal Court, right, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor petit larceny for taking $7,000 of jewelry and electrical goods from a friend's apartment . He initially confessed to taking the goods but then later denied them, blaming another acquaintance, according to the New York Post. But his guilty plea to misdemeanor petit larceny at Manhattan Criminal Court saved him from a felony record on the original top charge of grand larceny. He paid $3,400 in restitution money with the balance due in June. Bagley joked with the media on leaving court, reportedly telling photographers: 'I'm just glad they didn't find the bodies, that would have been bad.' The actor played Jason in the ABC mystery drama Pretty Little Liarswhen it first aired in 2010. But he was replaced by actor Drew Van Acker after just two episodes. The series has gone from strength to strength without him and was recently commissioned for a fifth series. Bagley has also had roles in the 2010 remake of horror classic A Nightmare on Elm Street and police fantasy drama Grimm. He told reporters outside the court that he is currently concentrating on trying to forge a career in music.","Parker Bagley pleaded guilty to misdemeanor petit larceny .

"United Airlines revealed flight numbers for two out of three planes Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan reportedly traveled on during his trip to the United States. The airline said  it believed Duncan took Flight 951 from Brussels Airport to Washington Dulles International Airport, then Flight 822 to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in a Wednesday statement. 'While the CDC states it is unnecessary for it or the airline to contact others who were on the patient’s flights, United is providing information about the flights United believes the patient took, based on information provided by the CDC,' the airline said. 'We are ensuring our employees have this information and suggest that any customers who have concerns contact the experts at the CDC for further information.' A third flight number has yet to be released, though Duncan was likely on Brussels Airlines Flight 1247 before boarding the United planes, CBS DFW reported. Scroll down for videos . Thomas Eric Duncan reportedly flew from Liberia to Brussels and then into Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport - with a connection in between . Unfriendly skies: Thomas Eric Duncan was able to board a plane to the U.S. and land in Dallas after having come in close contact with at least one person who died of Ebola . Wencke Lemmes, a spokesperson for Brussels Airlines, told MailOnline 'We cannot confirm whether the person in question has been travelling with us or not. Belgian law actually prohibits us to communicate any name of a passenger to external parties nor can we confirm the presence of a person on board of one of our flights - only the authorities are allowed to do so. 'What counts for Brussels Airlines is that independently on whether the person traveled with us or not, CDC states that the person showed no illness symptoms before nor during his travel, hence, there has at no time been a risk of contamination. A person is only contagious if he/she shows illness symptoms. 'In addition, Brussels Airlines has at no time been asked by CDC to inform its guests or staff of its Monrovia flights about the presence of an Ebola patient. The security and safety of our guests and staff remains at all times our first priority and as such we keep monitoring the situation in the three countries hit by Ebola very closely and keep the measures taken in close cooperation with the authorities and medical experts in place.'

Conservative news blog Gotnews.com published an email from someone claiming to work for United Airlines, which allegedly revealed Duncan's full flight itinerary - including a trip back to West Africa approximately two weeks from now - and alleged that Duncan was a Brussels Airlines Flight 1247 passenger. The tipster wrote 'I work in reservations for United Airlines. That's all I'm willing to say about my identity.' 'His return flight was scheduled to depart Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) on Oct. 19,' the alleged email said. 'The return flight was scheduled for DFW-IAD-BRU-FNA (FNA is Lungi Intl Airport in Freetown, Sierra Leone). United Airlines did not immediately return a request for comment on the allegedly employee-leaked itinerary and if Duncan in fact planned a return trip. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not immediately return a request for comment regarding Duncan's reported flights into the United States. U.S. officials had previously refused to provide details of Duncan's itinerary, claiming none of his fellow passengers were at risk because he was not showing symptoms at that time. From Washington Dulles International Airport (pictured), Duncan made his way to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, United Airlines believes . The CDC (pictured) is working with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to identify potential victims and warn other travelers of the health threat . The New York Times reported that Duncan helped care for a woman who later died of the disease just days before his journey. Had a customs official asked him about his contact with Ebola patients, he could have been flagged as being at high risk for infection. Public health officials say the chances of an outbreak in the United States are low. The United States has sanitation and medical care that far exceeds that found in the affected West African nations, which are among the poorest in the world. Currently, patients are checked for fever - the first sign of a possible infection - before they are allowed to board flights leaving West African nations. However, once travelers gets past examiners in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea, there are few barriers to them moving across the world. U.S. Customs and Border Protection says the agency's examiners at airports and other ports of entry are trained to spot and identify people potentially infected with Ebola before they enter the country. It's a long way to Texas: Thomas Duncan flew from Liberia to Belgium to Washington, D.C., before finally arriving in Dallas on September 20 . However, a spokeswoman could provide no information about how the agency was changing its rules to prevent more Ebola infected fliers from coming into the U.S. Airlines for America, the industry trade group, on Wednesday U.S. airlines are in regular contact with the Centers for Disease Control and other government agencies about helping to prevent the spread of Ebola. 'A4A members that fly to affected countries remain in steady contact with government agencies and health officials, and have procedures in place to monitor and quickly respond to potential health concerns,' spokeswoman Victoria Day said. Stocks in major U.S. air carriers fell as much as nearly . 4 percent on Wednesday over fears that the spread of the worst . known Ebola outbreak beyond West Africa would make more . customers fearful of traveling. 'People are nervous about (the first case of Ebola detected . in the United States) and what it means,' said Michael Derchin, . an analyst at CRT Capital Group LLC. Still, Derchin said that the market had overreacted. 'I would be surprised if there's any impact on travel,' he . said. JetBlue Airways and American Airlines said . they were closely following guidelines from the U.S. Centers for . Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

"Those who fear 3D-printed plastic guns take note: a Tennessee man has demonstrated that a deadly firearm can also be made completely out of items available from airport retail stores. Web developer Evan Booth of Greensboro, North Carolina moonlights as a 'security expert' and can make projectile weapons with things like hairdryers and Axe body spray--all of which you can get after you make it through security. While he has an airport crossbow, blowgun, and spiked club, it's Booth's hand-built gun--which he calls his BLUNDERBUSiness Class--that seems most worrisome. Scroll down for video demo . Scary: Evan Booth of Greensboro hosts a website where he demonstrates how to make, among other things, a gun (pictured) out of items available for purchase in airport terminals past the security checkpoint . ‘I think people have kind of been suspecting that the type of things I’ve built are possible,’ Booth tells Fast Company. ‘I just don’t think anyone’s ever taken the time to do it.’ Booth, who attended East Tennessee State University and earned a degree in digital media, says he embarked on the startling project after airports began to introduce body scanners. ‘It just seemed so invasive, really expensive,’ he said. ‘And if you’re going to go through all that trouble getting into the terminal, why is all this stuff available in the terminal?’ To Booth, whose speaking engagements include hacker conferences across America and abroad, that stuff equaled a disturbing possibility. Ingenious: Booth says he got the idea to when he realized he could buy lithium batteries, which cause a hot chemical reaction when combined with water. 'If I wanted to build something very potent, I would probably go toward lithium,' he says . Aromatic: The lithium and water create enough heat to blow up a 1oz can of Axe body spray . So he began tinkering with the range of seemingly innocuous items available in airport shops that line the terminals on the wrong side of security. And he found that not only was he able to create a gun, but he could also make a range of potentially deadly weapons, all of which he demonstrates on his website Terminal Cornucopia. ‘If we're trying stop a terrorist threat at the airport,’ says Booth. ‘It's already too late.’ KERPOW! The can of Axe body spray explodes in a cloud of fire . Serious business: Using a handful of change as the projectile, the gun Booth dubs a BLUNDERBUSiness Class blows a hole larger than a quarter in a drywall target . Moonlighting: Evan Booth works with computers by day but calls himself a 'security researcher' by night, which is when he tinkers with his airport weapons at his home in North Carolina . The idea for his BLUNDERBUSiness gun came . to him after he realized airports sell lithium batteries. When mixed . with water, that lithium can create enough heat to turn a can of Axe . body spray into aromatic ammunition. Combine it with a hollowed out hair dryer, some gossip magazines and other sundries and you’ve got yourself a gun. ‘Right now if I wanted to build something very potent, I would probably go toward lithium,’ says Booth. His YouTube demonstrations show his DIY gun propelling a handful of pocket change powerfully enough to blow a quart-sized hole though Sheetrock. In an effort to win some research . funds—and shield himself from unfriendly investigators—Booth notified . the FBI, CIA, and other agencies of his activities prior to posting them . on the internet. ‘It would have been awesome if I’d had access to, like, a cockpit door,’ he says.

"For more than two centuries it has been respected around the world as a sign of Britain’s greatness. Now the Union Jack, the nation’s proudest symbol, is poised to get a history-making new look – minus the Scottish saltire. Secret Government papers propose ditching the cross of St Andrew, a white X on a blue background, that makes up a third of the current design if Scotland votes for independence, the Daily Mail can reveal today. Banishing the blue: How the new Union Jack will look, according to secret Government documents . Iconic: The flag that has been famous for more than 200 years . That would leave a modified Union Jack comprising only the red cross of St George – representing England and Wales – and the red saltire of Ireland’s St Patrick. The dramatic change to our national flag – the first since 1801, when St Patrick’s cross was added – was accidentally revealed in confidential papers carried by a Government adviser in Downing Street. Briefing notes seen as he stepped from a ministerial car show a detailed design for the new flag and appear to list strategies for introducing it post-referendum. The Daily Mail can confirm that the Scot-free flag is already in production at Britain’s longest-established producer. Undercover pictures taken inside Flagmakers of Chesham, Buckinghamshire, show a red and white design exactly as described on the Downing Street papers. Flagged up: An aide accidentally shows papers detailing the plan as he steps out of a car . Manufacture is going ahead despite the fact that no vote will be held on Scottish independence until September 18, and no decision has been made in Scotland yet on whether to keep the Union Jack or use only the Scottish saltire. Machine-room workers at Flagmakers are believed to have produced hundreds of Scot-free versions and are confident they can meet demand if necessary. Changing the flag would need both political and royal approval. It is understood the Downing Street strategy maps out a timeline to include liaising with Buckingham Palace. The race to get everything completed inside six months began after experts at the Flag Institute, an advisory charity, released a set of possible designs for a post-independence flag six weeks ago. A survey last year found nearly 65 per cent would be in favour of the change in the event of a Yes vote. But the haste with which the Government is anticipating ditching the saltire is bound to cause outrage among No vote supporters. Yesterday UK-OK organisers in Scotland told the Mail they would ‘fight to the end’ to save the Union Jack and resist any moves to make Scotland a saltire-only zone. Campaigner Avril McTickle explained: ‘There is no constitutional need to change the flag, and no justification whatsoever for Downing Street to hatch a policy in secret to do so. No one removed the cross of St Patrick from the flag when the Irish Free State was created in 1922. Why take the saltire off now?’","Symbol has represented Britain for two centuries and is respected globally .

"A new dating app, LUXY,  allows singles to weed out poor and unattractive matches. Like Tinder, users can swipe through potential dates anonymously, and will only be matched with suitors who find them mutually attractive. However, on LUXY, the average male user earns over $200,000 a year, and those who are 'unable to keep up financially' are immediately removed from the app. Scroll down for video . Only for the rich: On LUXY, the average male user earns over $200,000 a year, and those who are 'unable to keep up financially' are immediately removed from the app . 'With the rise of high-speed digital dating, it's about time somebody introduced a filter to weed out low-income prospects by neighborhood,' says the app's mysterious CEO, who will only name himself as Tim T. He claims that everyone would secretly love to date someone both attractive and wealthy, and that his app is merely helping to facilitate those types of matches. LUXY says its members include CEOs, professional athletes, doctors, lawyers, investors, entrepreneurs, beauty queens, fitness models and even Hollywood celebrities. Signing up for the app is similar to Tinder and other modern dating service. Users are first prompted to log in via Facebook so that the app can analyze their connections. Once logged in, you're asked to select from a list of hobbies. Unlike a normal dating site, the list of hobbies caters exclusively to the well off. Gourmet dining, horseback riding, racquetball, golf and boating all qualify as acceptable hobbies, whereas more modest pastimes such as thrifting or going for a bike ride are strictly off limits. Wealth quiz: Signing up for the app is similar to Tinder. Users  log in via Facebook so that the app can analyze their connections. Once logged in, you're asked to select from a list of hobbies and favorite brands . After indicating the appropriate interests, users are to identify their favorite brands. As with hobbies, it's important to select 'high class' interests. Among the list of acceptable brands are Louis Vuitton, Mercedes, Gucci, Bentley and Cartier. Users who enjoy washing down their Big Mac with a cool can of Pabst Blue Ribbon after a long cruise in their VW Bug are sadly unwelcome on LUXY. Finally, users are asked to state their income. The app defaults to $350,000 a year, however users are free to disclose assets over $1million. While the company says it's currently working on building safeguards against not-so-wealthy-users, at the moment they rely on a self-correcting system. A quick swipe through potential LUXY suitors yields an investment banker who attended Princeton and enjoys rolex watches, a motorcycle collector who enjoys boating and earns nearly half a million per year, and a young fashion-crazed millionaire from Glasgow. Show-offs: The wealthy users are also encouraged to share 'moments' from their luxurious lifestyles to prove that they're not just low-income posers . The wealthy users are also encouraged to share 'moments' from their luxurious lifestyles to prove that they're not  low-income posers. You can cross-post these moments to Facebook and Twitter, where the photo will appear with the hashtag #luxurymoments. Many moments consist of glamourous selfies and snapshots from exotic locales. One user uploaded an image of herself in a white Bentley captioned, 'On our way to the Ivy!' while another boasted a large Yves Saint Laurent box with the message, 'Gorgeous new pumps from YSL! I <3 <3 <3 them!!'. A male user in Florida got straight to the point and uploaded an image of himself with fists full of $100 bills. 'Casino flow' he noted. Currently the app only has around 3,000 members, however it's growing quickly as wealthy users are encouraged to invite their rich friends. And if those friends happen to fall into lower income brackets?

But when you're a millionaire American gambler buying the world's most expensive bottle of champagne it's just a case of using up small change. Gambler Don Johnson, 49, broke the world record at a London nightclub for the most expensive bottle of bubbly ever bought during a night that saw him spend £170,000 ($271,000) on drinks. Careful, don't spill it: Businessman and gambler Don Johnson spray revellers with £120,000 champagne bought from the One For One nightclub in Park Lane, London, over the weekend . Best bubbly in town: Mr Johnson enjoys the taste of wealth as revelers help to lift the impressive bottle which broke the record for the previous most expensive champagne at £15,000 . Mr Johnson paid a whopping £120,000 . ($191,000) for the extravagantly decorated 45kg bottle holding 30 litres of . bubbly over the weekend. The businessman made the purchase while chalking up a £168,118 bill during a trip to Park Lane's swanky One For One nightclub. The star, who was in town visiting rock star pal Bon Jovi, started the night with a relatively cheap bottle of Dom Perignon Luminous Magnum 2002 for £750. This was followed by a bottle of Grey Goose Magnum at £420. Ouch! A till receipt from the club shows how Mr Johnson racked up almost £170,000 . After four complimentary bottles of soda water and four cans of red bull for £5, Mr Johnson splashed out with a £25,000 Armand De Brignac Methuselah. But then the atmosphere, and perhaps the previous drink, appears to have brought out the big spender in Mr Johnson . He heard the nightclub had recently commissioned the biggest bottle of champagne ever made, the Armand De Brignac Midas, and he ordered the bank-breaking bubbly. Taking to the stage, Johnson grabbed a microphone and popped the cork. He then sprayed the room with champagne and glugged from the bottle. The generous gambler then offered swigs of the classy drink to thrilled revellers. However, according to a friend, themillionaire - known as The Champagne King - doesn’t even like the taste of the French sparkling wine. A single litre of the alcohol is worth £4,000 and would fill eight champagne flutes, each worth £500. The previous record for most expensive bottle of champagne was held by the Armand De Brignac (Ace of Spades) Nebuchadnezzar, a 15 litre bottle. The champagne was bought by an anonymous customer at One for One for £80,000. Johnson, who has become notorious for his partying lifestyle, is set to host Pamela Anderson's Birthday Party in Las Vegas this summer. Earlier this year Mr Johnson beat the Tropicana Casino and Resort in Bensalem, Pennsylvania,  for $5.8 million at blackjack. The win was part of a spectacular roll that also saw him beat Caesars Atlantic City for more than $4.2 million and the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa for $5 million. It was the first time a casino has lost money in blackjack over a sustained period since gambling in the city was legalised in 1978. Rich: Mr Johnson, who has changed his champagne-drenched shirt, poses next to the bottle with revellers . Plush: The One for One nightclub in Park Lane, Mayfair, attracts a number of wealthy guests . The incredible wins are just a tiny proportion windfalls he has had throughout his career. Nik Krasniqi, floor manager at the £950-a-year members club, said: 'Everyone was gathered round his table and he was on the microphone singing Bon Jovi songs, screaming ''I love London''. Winemakers Armand de Brignac released the 'Midas' in January. It is a 30-litre vessel equivalent to 40 regular-sized 750ml bottles and weighing 100 pounds. The bottle’s name, Midas, comes from King Midas, remembered in Greek mythology for the ability to turn whatever he touched to gold. Two grown men are typically needed to carry it. Champagne bottles of this size were banned for 75 years beginning around the turn of the 20th century, until glassmaking techniques made bottles safe from explosion due to the pressure of a large volume of Champagne in a single vessel. Armand de Brignac is the luxury Champagne from the award-winning Champagne Cattier chateau of Chigny-les-Roses, France. Instantly identifiable by the dramatic Ace of Spades insignias on its bottle, Armand de Brignac boasts three prestige cuvées - Brut Gold, Rosé and Blanc de Blancs. Ranked the number one Champagne in the world in a blind-tasting of over 1,000 brands, Armand de Brignac exemplifies unmatched winemaking expertise and a true passion for the art of Champagne. 'He was hugging the bottle and everyone . in the club was going wild. When he left, the ceiling, the floor and . everyone in the club was covered in champagne. 'His goal is to be the biggest spender ever in nightclubs all over the world. He is in Vegas and he wanted to do it in London. 'He likes to party very, very hard. He had the microphone and was screaming ''Don Mother F*****g Johnson'' over and over.' Johnson’s lifestyle manager, Sophie Raibin from Raibin Productions, said along with champagne, the millionaire loves to shower people with his generosity. She said: 'The last time Don was in London he spent more than £100,000 in a week. 'This time he did it in one night. 'He has spent millions of pounds on champagne in his life, he gives away and just wants people to have fun. 'He doesn’t like to drink champagne, although he had quite a lot to drink last night. He’s not acquired the taste, he prefers to drink vodka. 'His favourite thing is the microphone, he is known for it and he loves it. He is very good at getting a crowd going. You’ve got to see it to believe it.' Sophie said the enormous bottle proved difficult to get into after the cork snapped twice. Sophie said: 'In the end we had to get some pliers to get it out. 'It took a while but when it opened it went everywhere – every single person in the room was sprayed. The crowd went ballistic I’ve never seen anything like it.'","'Midas' bottles of bubble needs two people to carry it .

Amie Scull, a buying assistant for stationery at John Lewis, said that sales of items such as photo corners, which hold pictures in place, were increasing, as making scrapbooks returned to favour. She said: 'This may be in part due to people wanting a return to displaying and enjoying photos, rather than just leaving them on digital cameras and computers. 'Craft in general has been back in vogue for a while, with people revisiting the joy of the manual hobbies of their childhoods. 'Of course, new social media platforms like Pinterest could also have had a positive effect, kickstarting the trend by reminding people how useful collating images and inspirational pieces into one place can be.'","Retailers say younger generation have become interested in scrapbooks .

"Footage of an Australian man who features in a chilling video condoning the beheadings of ISIS fighters  will be investigated 'very closely' by the Australian Government. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Australia's 'intelligence, police and security' will view the video, which shows combat medic and self-described 'true blue Aussie' Abu Ousama defending ISIS beheadings to protect the 'innocent Muslims of this country.' Ms Bishop condemned the messages and has vowed to investigate in order to safeguard Australians from 'murderous cults.' Scroll down for video . Speaking in a thick Australian accent Abu Ousama says he condones the beheadings by terror group ISIS . Ousama is living among rebel fighters and working as a medic for Jund al-Aqsa, a group affiliated with ISIS . Ms Bishop said it was 'unthinkable' that anyone would be defending beheadings for religious or territorial messages, the ABC reported. 'These are murderous cults and they are using Islam to cover up for their violent behaviour. They are using religion as an excuse for what is simply murder, Ms Bishop said. Speaking in a thick Australian accent Mr Ousama said he is missing home comforts like Coco Pops and says 'home is home, everybody is going to love their country'. He says there is no difference between a missile killing 15 people and one man getting his throat cut . Australian jihadist Ousama spoke candidly to a British photojournalist about his experience in Syria . Julie Bishop has vowed to investigate the video . Ousama is living among rebel fighters for Jund al-Aqsa and is one of the 100 Australians who have crossed over into Syria since the conflict began. Since the airing of the footage Tony Abbott's office has referred the footage to Australian intelligence agencies, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. He took part in the interview broadcast on 7News by British photojournalist Tam Hussain who lived with the 1000 strong Islamic battalion group that is independent of ISIS but supports their ideology. Ousama, who didn't say where he was from in Australia, told 7News: 'You have these beheadings and some people might call them barbaric, some people might have these names for them but what is the difference between a missile that hits into a house which kills 15 kids compared to a man dying getting cut by his throat.' He says the brutality of ISIS is a necessary part of establishing an Islamic State. 'ISIS have taken this role of protecting the innocent Muslims of this country, of this land. 'So, they have to do what they need to do to make their state. Tam Hussain spoke to Abu Ousama when he was living in a city north of Hama . 'If they're blackmailing America or anybody saying don't shoot a missile which is going to kill 50 or 60 people for one bloke how can we even say that's equivalent to it being a wrong?' When Ousama is not fighting he works as a medic in a local hospital and he wants the Australian public to know that he would not pose a risk if he returned home. 'There is no hatred between me and Australia. Actually home is home, everybody is going to love their country,' he said. British photojournalist Tam Hussain spent weeks living and interviewing the Islamic terror group . Hussain was treated like a member of the group in northern Syria for his time spent with the group . Ousama says that ISIS have taken on its role to protect 'innocent Muslims' ISIS fighters now have strongholds in Iraq and Syria . Islamic State terrorists have raised the black flag of Jihad in Kobane, Kurdish forces have been trying to resist this for weeks . The young Aussie also reveals that there are no home comforts living in Syria and he has to pay 500 Syrian for a box of Coco Pops. 'Just because you miss home you feel like some Coco Pops,' he told 7News. Despite his positive memories about Australia he does not rule out fighting against troops who might invade. 'If they are going to come in with their aeroplanes and shoot missiles and kill innocents etc etc then how can anybody, you're forced to. 'I hope that Allah accepts the good we've done and blesses us with his reward if the highest paradise. This is the best. What more could you want, you know? 'I'm sad to see Australia taking that step to come into a place it doesn't need to be because it will cause a reaction, it will cause people to hate it,' he told 7News. Ousama says the brutal beheading of James Foley was 'necessary' for ISIS to develop the Islamic State .

"President Barack Obama has thrown his acting IRS commissioner overboard, making Steven Miller the highest-ranking political casualty thus far in a series of scandals that have swept his administration in recent weeks. In a hastily called press conference in the East Room of the White House, Obama told reporters that he had asked Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew to find out who was responsible for a program that targeted tea party groups and other conservative organizations for a special level of intrusive questioning after they applied for tax-exempt charitable statuses. 'Lew took the first step by requesting and accepting the resignation of the acting director of the IRS,' Obama said. 'It’s important,' he added, 'to institute new leadership that can help restore confidence going forward.' But in an email to IRS employees, Miller claimed he would only be leaving next month because his assignment would be over. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Steven Miller is shown in a CBS report.

'This has been an incredibly difficult time for the IRS . given the events of the past few days, and there is a strong and . immediate need to restore public trust in the nation’s tax agency.' The IRS, the president conceded, 'improperly screened conservative groups.' He referred to a report released Tuesday by the IRS's Inspector General. 'The misconduct that it uncovered is inexcusable,' Obama exclaimed. 'It's inexcusable and Americans are right to be angry about it, and I am angry about it.' 'It should not matter what political stripe you're from,' Obama said. 'The IRS has to operate with absolute integrity.' President Barack Obama said he would implement the recommendations of the IG report, but insisted that acting IRS Commissioner Steven MIller would be stepping down.

Promising to adopt the recommendations of the Inspector General's report, Obama pledged to 'put in place new safeguards to make sure this kind of behavior can't ever happen again.' 'We will work with Congress as it performs its oversight role,' he added, saying the White House would march 'hand in hand with Congress to get this thing fixed.' Tax laws, he insisted, must be 'enforced in a fair and impartial way.' Miller's farewell letter cited 'a strong and immediate need to restore public trust in the nation’s tax agency.'

"A widow locked in a 10-year legal battle with a Texas hospital to have her husband's heart returned says the organ she was given could be from an animal. When Linda Carswell's husband, Jerry, died unexpectedly after being treated for kidney stones in 2004, his heart was removed and kept without the family's permission. The remains were finally released by St Joseph Medical Center but when Mrs Carswell had them tested independently the results were disturbing. Questions: Linda Carswell has filed a petition to ask why the organ the hospital claims is heart tissue from her husband, Jerry, was found to have no human DNA when she had it tested by an independent laboratory . Grief: Linda, pictured with husband Jerry, wanted his heart returned so she could fully lay her husband to rest . When scientists at NMS Labs, a forensic laboratory in Pennsylvania, examined the heart they could find no trace of human DNA. According to a biologist, the missing human DNA could be a result of how the heart had been preserved, or a 'real possibility that the heart submitted was not human'. The lab analysis also questioned what the tissue had been preserved in, stating it 'didn't smell like formaldehyde'. The shocking results mean Mrs Carswell is still unable to fully lay her husband to rest. She told ProPublica she feared burying the unknown organ tissue could 'desecrate the grave'. Mrs Carswell told Mail Online: 'The hospitals and their pathologists continuously have represented to the courts and to us that it was Jerry's heart, that it was properly preserved, and that DNA testing would confirm it was his heart.' Memories: Linda and Jerry Carswell at their son Jordan's wedding. Mr Carswell died in hospital in 2004 . Shocked: Linda Carswell, pictured with Jerry and their granddaughter, says she was horrified to learn that no human DNA could be found in the heart tissue . She added that after the long legal battle following her husband's death, the family thought nothing could surprise them. 'Now we are more than surprised - we are shocked and horrified,' she said. adding: 'As much as we would like to put this behind us, now we find it necessary to go back to court.' The family's attorney, Neil McCabe, said they had approached the court to ask for depositions of relevant representatives of the hospitals and pathologists, to get answers about why the materials that they claimed was Mr Carswell's heart were found to be devoid of human DNA. 'Whether or not our inquiries will lead to further legal action must await the court's decision on our request for depositions and what those depositions reveal,' he told Mail Online. Unexpected: Jerry Carswell was being treated for kidney stones when he unexpectedly died at Christus St Catherine Hospital in Texas . Autopsy: When the retired teacher's body was examined at St Joseph Medical Center, part of the heart was removed and kept . For the family, the results mean they . are still lacking closure in the unexpected death of Mr Carswell, who . died shortly after being given drugs on the day he was due to leave . Christus St Catherine Hospital in Katy, Texas. The retired teacher had been admitted to hospital for kidney stone treatment. His . widow successfully sued the hospital for $2 million for fraud over an . independent autopsy she had requested to see if the drugs had played a . role in her husband's death. The autopsy didn't determine a cause for death and did not include the drugs test the family had requested. The hospital was cleared of causing the father-of-two's death by negligence. A . court of appeals upheld the lawsuit verdict, but the hospital is asking . for the case to be heard again. It declined to comment on the DNA . testing of the heart. Two years after her husband's death, Mrs Carswell also discovered that the St Joseph medical center that carried out the autopsy had kept part of her husband's heart. The hospital argued that it needed the tissue for possible evidence in the legal battle, but finally an appeals court ordered that it be returned to the family. Erin Lunceford, an attorney for the medical center, told ProPublica she didn't know why the heart had no human DNA. Closure: The ongoing legal battle and DNA test results have been hard for Linda, who is mourning the loss of Jerry, who died in 2004 . She said the hospital was now under new ownership and the heart was only under the current owner's possession. Mrs Carswell, who has filed a petition to be able to question the hospital about the DNA results, said the analysis 'really hurts me'. 'I felt it was right to get Jerry’s heart returned to us, to our family, so we could bury the heart and get it out of their hands,' she said.

This is one of numerous fences that have been erected by the wealthy 'haves' of the Michigan suburb of Grosse Pointe Park to 'prevent 'have-nots' from Detroit from driving into the city. The brick barrier, reading 'Road Ends', represents a significant divide between the two cities, which despite their proximity, differ greatly in terms of average salary, crime rates and general desirability.

Above, the Grosse Point Park home of Art Van Furniture Corporation president, Gary Van Elslander . No entry: Five roads that should connect Detroit with the rich suburb Grosse Pointe Park are cut off, including Kercheval Avenue, where Grosse Pointe Park authorities recently built a traffic barrier . In Detroit, the median household income is just $26,955 - with many of the poorest residents taking home much less - compared to a  higher $101,094 in Grosse Pointe Park, according to the LA Times. Similarly, the Motor City last year declared the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history, while its neighbor's quaint shops, beer gardens and antiques stores are thriving with residents. And in relation to crime rate, Detroit's Precinct 4 takes an average of 30 minutes to respond to an incident, while Grosse Pointe Park police typically arrive in just 3.4. This is perhaps unsurprising considering that Detroit, once the industrial capital of the nation, was voted the most dangerous city in the country in 2012, for the fourth year in a row. The city, left ravaged by dwindling blue-collar jobs, the decline of the auto industry and rising unemployment, was found by Forbes to have a violent crime rate of 2,137 per 100,000 residents. It has lost more than 200,000 residents in the last decade - and 1.3million since the 1950s - as citizens have fled the blighted city for better-off suburbs with lower crime and better education. Worlds apart: The barriers (including these yellow ones) represent a significant divide between the two cities, which despite their proximity, differ greatly in terms of average salary, crime rates and general desirability .

Leafy: Grosse Point Park's (pictured) quaint shops, beer gardens and antiques stores are thriving with locals . But Forbes pointed out that even with the population drop, there were 344 murders in 2011, compared with 395 in 2001. There are also racial discrepancies between Detroit and Grosse Pointe Park, with around 85 per cent of the former's residents being white, compared to 82 per cent of Detroit's locals being black. Earlier this year, the 'haves' of Grosse Pointe Park erected a fence on Kercheval Road, one of the few streets via which drivers can access Detroit. Officials claimed it was set up for a farmers' market, but the move sparked anger among Detroit residents. And last winter, the suburb  allegedly deliberately plowed snow to form another barrier. 'There's so much tension between the suburbs and the city in Wayne County,' Kevin Boyle, a Detroit native, told the newspaper.

The suburbs are terrified by the thought that they'd be caught up in Detroit's problem.' The tension is such that at the five Grosse Pointe municipalities, dubbed 'the Pointes', residents must show an ID to enter public parks. But despite the suburb's pristine exterior, it is also undergoing financial problems, with budget cuts and decreasing house prices forcing some to cross back over the border. It has also been reported that newly-elected Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan has now signed a deal with Grosse Pointe Park that could help ease the tensions. Michigan suburb: The tension between the two cities is such that at the five Grosse Pointe (pictured) municipalities, dubbed 'the Pointes', residents must show an ID to enter public parks . In accordance with the deal, Detroit will tear down some of the dilapidated houses around the border, while Grosse Pointe Park will remove the 'haves/have-nots' fences in return, it is said. In the booming post-Second World War era, Detroit was America's fifth-largest city, boasting an enormous population of 1,850,000 in 1950. It was given its Motor City name by General Motors Co, Chrysler and Ford Motor Co, but in the 1970s and 80s, the auto industry suffered setbacks that impacted heavily on Detroit. Many Americans feel the city's road back from ruin will require a dedicated joint effort between the state government and citizens.","Grosse Point Park has allegedly erected fences to keep out Detroit locals .

"Addiction: Danny Bowman, 19, became so obsessed with seeking perfection he took an overdose at his Newcastle home . When Danny Bowman was at school, he was so desperate to attract girls, he spent 10 hours a day taking more than 200 selfies trying to find the perfect image. But his addiction, which began at the age of 15, caused him to drop out of school and lose almost two stone in weight. He did not leave his house in Newcastle upon Tyne for six months, and when he failed to take the flawless shot, he tried to kill himself by taking an overdose. His mother, Penny, managed to save him, but he was forced to seek help after his addiction had spiralled out of control. The 19-year-old believed to be Britain's first selfie addict, has now had therapy to treat his technology addiction, OCD and Body dysmorphic disorder – an excessive anxiety about personal appearance. He has not taken a picture of himself in seven months, and has realised that achieving perfection is impossible.

Facebook, he said people would write negative comments, with one saying . his nose was too big while another mocked his complexity. He told ITV's Daybreak: 'Perfection is impossible. I just kept taking them and taking them. 'I wanted to have one that was completely flawless. It was ten hours a day, 200 selfies. 'I think this kind of thing can happen to anyone, for me it manifested itself in selfies; it could be something different for someone else. 'This would not have happened if it was not in the media age. The programme's psychiatrist Dr. Linda Papadopoulos said that modern day pressures are getting to some younger people. He joined Dr. Linda Papadopoulos who said that the online culture was putting pressure on some teenagers . The teenager from Newcastle took his first selfie at the age of 15, and it soon spiralled into an obsession . Danny appeared on Daybreak to talk about body dysmorphic disorder and met presenter Phillip Schofield . She said: 'You add on to that this cultural need to almost release press releases for ourselves. 'It's like people saying ""look at my life"" and ""look how exciting my life is"".' The selfie craze has grown in past . five years, with stars, ­politicians and even Pope Francis posting . getting involved in the sensation. But . one psychologist at a clinic where Danny was treated said the addiction . with taking selfies has now become a mental illness. Now . determined to raise awareness of the anxiety disorder, Danny is working . with Fixers – a national charity helping young people ‘to ‘fix’ the . issues that matter to them. He said their help has kept him alive and called on others to seek help before they end up in hospital. Danny spoke to Daybreak's Dr Ranj about his experiences of the disorder, which distorted his view of himself . Many people feel unhappy about the way they look at some point in their life, but for some, it can become a mental illness with long-lasting effects. The condition causes sufferers to spend a lot of time worrying about their appearance and have a distorted view of how they look. They may be convinced a scar has developed into a major flaw that everyone is starring at. All ages can be affected, but it usually begins in adolescence and does not necessarily mean the person is vain. The condition can lead to the person becoming depressed and may, in cases like Danny's, lead to thoughts of suicide.","Danny Bowman, 19, spent 10 hours a day trying to take a flawless image .

"A Muslim man who had a sudden brain aneurysm that left him in a coma has converted to Christianity following a near-miraculous recovery. Karim Shamsi-Basha was in a coma for a month in 1992 but when he woke up, he began a 20-year journey that lead to him becoming a Christian. His neurosurgeon told him he had seen very few people in his condition go on to make a full recovery and suggested that Mr Shamsi-Basha find out why he survived. Scroll down for video . Syrian-born Mr Shamsi-Basha (left) wrote a book called Paul and Me, (right) which talks about the 20-year journey that lead to him becoming a Christian, following the brain aneurysm that put him in a coma . Syrian-born Mr Shamsi-Basha wrote a book about his journey, called PAUL AND ME, which includes chapters about Paul - one of the Bible's best known figures - whose conversion to Christianity took place in the city of Damascus. The author and photojournalist grew up in a closely-knit Muslim family in Syria who were tolerant of all faiths, with a best friend who was a Christian, but he did not seriously consider changing religion before his illness. Mr Shamsi-Basha told the Christian Post that he practiced Islam as a teenager. 'I prayed five times a day. I walked to the mosque before sunrise. I fasted the month of Ramadan,' he said. When he was 18 he left the country, ran by the first Assad regime, to study at the University of Tennessee in the U.S. before working as a photojournalist at a local newspaper in Birmingham Alabama, getting married and fathering a son. It was in 1992 when he was covering a fire at Independent Presbyterian . Church for his local newspaper, that Mr Shamsi-Basha collapsed in its car park where he suffered a brain . aneurism that could have left him paralysed, The Marietta Daily journal reported. Watch the full interview here. After months of therapy, Mr Shamsi-Basha made a full recovery which he describes as 'miraculous'. On the road to recovery, Mr Shamsi-Basha, who now lives in Nashville, Tennessee, began to read the Bible and was baptised in 1996, but he said it took the end of his first marriage, the death of his father and homelessness, until he fully believed in Jesus. Mr Shamsi-Basha told the religious publication that God takes 'credit for my conversion. It was the grace of God that saved me.'

"A massive moth measuring a foot from wing tip to wing tip has been found in Lancashire. The Giant Atlas Moth is normally seen in south-east Asia, particularly in Malaysia. However, one was found by the Blackmore family in Ramsbottom - more than 6,000 miles away. Mark Lightowler of Animal World with the foot-wide moth which turned up in a Lancashire back garden - and has already bred. Atlas moths are considered the largest moths in the world. Females are larger and heavier than males. They survive for a week after emerging as a moth. In India, Atlas moths are cultivated for their silk. Atlas moths are said to be named after either the Titan of Greek mythology, or their map-like wing patterns. In Hong Kong the Cantonese name translates as 'snake's head moth', referring to their forewing, which some say resembles a snake's head. It has now taken up residence at Animal World in Bolton and has laid eggs - which have hatched into caterpillars. Centre manager Mark Lightowler said: ""The moth was found in the back yard of a house in Ramsbottom. 'It must have escaped from a private collection. 'The family contacted Animal World and I could not believe they had found a Giant Atlas Moth in their backyard. 'It doesn't happen. 'It is just amazing and for it to have laid eggs, I am staggered.' The moth was brought to Animal World in a large container on the advice of Mr Lightowler in mid-August and two weeks ago the caterpillars hatched and now measure five inches. They can all be seen at the centre's butterfly house. Mr Lightowler added: 'Often when people see Giant Atlas Moth they don't believe they are real because of their size. 'This moth would just not be able to survive in the wild and for it to have survived is amazing.' The Giant Atlas moth is well known for its massive size. Here Sir David Attenborough, holds one at a London museum.","Animal usually found in Malaysia .

"One of the most valuable paintings found in a hoard of art looted by the Nazis – a Matisse valued at up to £60million – is due to be handed to the ex-wife of Dominique Strauss Kahn. Sitting Woman, found among more than 1,400 artworks in a recluse’s Munich flat, is thought to have belonged to Miss Sinclair’s maternal grandfather, the late French art dealer Paul Rosenberg. The news marks a change in the fortunes of Miss Sinclair, 65, who helped pay for her ex-husband’s defence when the womanising International Monetary Fund chief was accused of being a rapist. They divorced in March. Remarkable: A painting from Henry Matisse called Sitzende Frau (Sitting Woman) - one of the previously unknown works found at Gurlitt's flat - is projected on a screen during a news conference in Augsburg. Anne Sinclair is laying claim to it . Mr Rosenberg, whose clients included . Matisse and Picasso, fled Paris during the Second World War, leaving . many works to the Germans. Chris Marinello, of the group Art Recovery International, said he was confident Miss Sinclair would be given the Matisse. The 1,400 paintings were found last . year at the home of Cornelius Gurlitt, 80. His father Hildebrand had . been employed by the Nazis to sell art said to be ‘degenerate’. Many . were bought for a pittance from fleeing Jewish collectors. In a phone call to MailOnline Mr Marinello revealed that he met with the Rosenberg family on Thursday and has drafted a letter for the German authorities claiming ownership of the Matisse. He said: 'We're hoping that they will accept our offer of a meeting in Munich.' The painting, he explained, was confiscated from Paul Rosenberg's gallery in Paris. He then fled to New York and upon his return to Paris after the Second World War could not find the artwork. He was Matisse's art dealer and so received the Sitting Woman directly from the artist himself, Mr Marinello added. It was on display in Paris, but it's not likely that many members of the public ever set eyes on it. Meanwhile, phones in the cramped London offices of the Art Loss Register have been ringing off the hook since German prosecutors announced what the register's chairman, Julian Radcliffe, calls ‘the biggest cache of illegally stored art since the end of the war.’ ‘People who are registered with us have been ringing to say, `You're on the case, aren't you?’' Radcliffe said Wednesday. Relationship: Anne Sinclair (right) divorced Dominique Strauss-Kahn (left) the former director of the IMF, in March 2013 . The flurry of activity follows the discovery in Germany of more than 1,400 artworks - some by modern masters such as Marc Chagall, Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso - stacked in the Munich apartment of an elderly man. For families whose treasures were stolen by Germany's Nazi regime, the discovery has raised hopes - but also stirred frustration. Citing an ongoing tax probe into the apartment's resident, German authorities have not revealed many details about the vast majority of the paintings, drawings, engravings, woodcuts and prints they have found. At a news conference Tuesday, officials described only a fraction of the spectacular find, including - tantalizingly - previously unknown paintings by Matisse, Chagall and German artist Otto Dix. That has sparked a clamor for information from art hunters, museums and the lawyers of those seeking to recover looted art. The Munich apartment where officials discovered the hidden Gurlitt paintings . A reproduction of a painting by Italian . painter Canaletto presented during the news conference on Tuesday that . could be worth £10million . Treasure trove: An allegorical scene . painting by Marc Chagall worth an estimated £15million had never been . seen by the art world before emerging from Gurlitt's collection . The Munich trove was found in early 2012 at the home of a man whom German officials didn't name but who has been identified in media reports as 80-year-old Cornelius Gurlitt. His father, Hildebrand Gurlitt, was an art dealer who acted for the Nazis in the 1930s to sell art considered ‘degenerate’ by the regime - including Impressionist and modern masterpieces - outside of Germany in return for cash. Some of the works were seized from museums, while others were stolen or bought for a pittance from Jewish collectors who were forced to sell. Gerhard Finckh, director of the Von der Heydt-Museum in Wuppertal, western Germany, called for an inventory of the Gurlitt trove to be published online quickly so museums can find out whether their stolen works are among them. Collector: Hildebrandt Gurlitt amassed more than 1,500 masterpieces and ordered them to be destroyed in 1945 . ‘If our works are among the discovered art, we will do everything to get them back,’ said Finckh, whose museum lost pieces by Dix, Paul Klee, Vassily Kandinsky and many others. Jewish groups also have called for the works to be made public immediately. Spokesman Steffen Seibert said Wednesday that Chancellor Angela Merkel's government favored releasing information about works that ‘may have been confiscated from people persecuted by the Nazis.’ But he gave no details or timeframe for that to happen. That leaves people seeking the return of artworks with no quick path to restitution. Imke Gielen, a Berlin lawyer specializing in restitution claims, said prospective claimants should approach the Bavarian prosecutors with queries about specific works. She said it was vital to prove ownership of the artwork until Jan. 30, 1933, the day the Nazis seized power. Any art lost after that is presumed to have been sold under pressure or seized, boosting the chances of restitution. Others will turn to the Art Loss Register, which maintains a database of several hundred thousand works of stolen or missing art. The organization's team of art sleuths, historians and legal experts was busy on Wednesday trying to match works on its database with the items found in Germany. Radcliffe says it has already found one match - not the Matisse - but won't say what artwork it is. Although there has been criticism of the Germans' delay in announcing the find, art law expert Coco Soodek was sympathetic. She said the trove is so large that it takes time to catalog the works - and ‘it might take a decade’ to reunite them with their owners. German officials say they have done preliminary work on only 500 pieces so far. ‘It's like a giant game of `Concentration,’' said Soodek, head of the art law team at Bryan Cave LLP. ‘They will designate the ones that we know to exist and match those up with documentation of stolen art. Those are the easy ones. You match up the ones you can get to first, and then you start a big detective search.’","The painting is one of many belonging to the late Parisian art dealer Paul Rosenberg that the Nazis stole .

"Her striking features have graced countless top fashion magazines and Europe’s great catwalks. Yet despite also being voted Scotland’s Most Stylish Woman recently, Amanda Hendrick has divided opinion over whether her supermodel looks are always picture perfect. In fact, images of the 21-year-old sporting a skimpy bikini have been banned from an online clothing retailer’s catalogue after advertising watchdogs ruled Miss Hendrick looked too thin. The Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) says the pictures on the website of Drop Dead Clothing were 'socially irresponsible' and told it to remove them. 'Too thin': Images of model Amanda Hendrick sporting this skimpy bikini have been banned from an online clothing retailer's catalogue by advertising watchdogs . The ASA acted after receiving a complaint which claimed the model 'looked anorexic' in one image of her wearing a watermelon-motif bikini and another where she sports cut-off denim shorts on the Sheffield-based company’s site. The ban comes just weeks after Miss Hendrick, of Airdrie, Lanarkshire, won the title of Scotland’s Most Stylish Woman at the Scottish Style Awards in Glasgow. Last night, Drop Dead Clothing, which is owned by the family of Miss Hendrick’s rock musician ex-boyfriend Oli Sykes, confirmed it had removed the offending pictures from its site. However, the company defended the model insisting that she does not have an eating disorder and had modelled successfully for the firm for three years. Oli’s mother, Carol Sykes, who also works for the firm, which has a shop in London, said the pictures were 'representative of young people' and pointed out that the costume Miss Hendrick is pictured wearing was a size 8. She said: 'Amanda certainly is slim, I’m not disputing that. 'She was my son’s former girlfriend and has been a family friend for three years and had modelled for us for three years. We have never had any complaints. 'I know her, she’s not anorexic or unhealthy and eats a very good diet. She’s just a naturally thin person. Ruling: The ASA acted after receiving a complaint claiming the model (left) 'looked anorexic' in the campaign . Miss Hendrick, pictured second from right at the 2010 Scottish Fashion Awards, was recently voted Scotland's most stylish woman at the Scotland Style Awards . 'Do I think people should aspire to be like her? Yes, because she is a beautiful person and jets around the world earning £600-plus a day. She’s got a successful career and no mental health problems. 'Do I think removing a picture of Amanda will stop people being mentally ill? No, I don’t, but I accept the decision and so does Amanda.' The spat is the first black mark on an otherwise flawless career, which saw Miss Hendrick plucked from obscurity as a gawky 15-year-old by a talent spotter at Glasgow’s Central Station. The former Airdrie Academy pupil was quickly snapped up by top modelling agency Storm, which launched Kate Moss’s career, after she was runner-up in the Nivea Model Search 2004 competition. Since then, she has gone on to feature on the cover of Vogue and Elle fashion magazines, modelled for Christian Dior in the Italian fashion capital Milan, and completed a photo-shoot for Glamour magazine, wearing Cartier and Valentino. She has also appeared at London and Paris Fashion Weeks and will be the face of Topshop’s Christmas campaign. Shooting star: The spat is the first black mark on an otherwise flawless career, which saw Miss Hendrick plucked from obscurity as a gawky 15-year-old by a talent spotter at Glasgow's Central Station . According to her online profile, she is 5ft 10ins with a 24-inch waist - 10in smaller than the average British woman and just an inch bigger than that of Victoria Beckham, who has sparked health fears because her 23-inch waist is the size of a typical seven-year-old child’s. The ASA’s ruling said: 'The ASA considered the model was very slim. We also noted that in the bikini and denim shorts images, hollows in her thighs were noticeable and she had prominent thigh bones. 'We considered that in combination with the stretched out pose and heavy eye make-up, the model looked underweight in the pictures. 'While we considered the bikini and denim short images might not cause widespread or serious offence, we concluded they were socially irresponsible.' Early in her career, the raven-haired beauty reflected on how her life had changed so dramatically from being teased by classmates about her height to becoming one of Europe's most sought-after models. She said: 'I was a goth at school and didn't really hang around with all the popular kids. 'They used to shout things at me and called me ugly but I didn't let it bother me. I still find it hard to believe that people think that I can now be a model. 'I think it shows you can just be yourself and have an individual look. Everyone doesn't have to be the same. I just hope I can continue to be successful because modelling has given me the chance to travel and experience new places and I want to continue to do that.' Miss Hendrick is currently represented by London-based Select Model Management and Glasgow’s Colours agency. Both declined to comment.","Amanda Hendrick, 21, recently voted Scotland's Most Stylish Woman ."
"A brave teenager pulled a police officer from a burning squad car - after the sound of the crash interrupted him watching Cops. Joe Chambers had been catching up on the show at his home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, when he heard a bang and rushed outside to find the officer trapped and the car going up in flames. The 17-year-old, who volunteers for his local fire service, reached inside through the window and hauled the dazed policeman out, according to New York Daily News. Scroll down for video . Joe Chambers, 17, pictured with Officer Mark Kimsey, who he rescued from his burning police car on Saturday . The teenager has been dubbed a hero after he stepped in and pulled the unconscious officer from the car . Officer Mark Kimsey, 30, had been responding to a priority call at about 5.30pm on Saturday when a black pickup truck crashed into the side of his vehicle and dented it shut. He had managed to radio the accident to control but the force of the crash had left him unable to move as he slipped in and out of consciousness. The high school senior pulled him out - along with neighbour  Dante Johnson - with seconds to spare as the flames engulfed the seat where Officer Kimsey had been sitting. Within four minutes flames had spread to the whole vehicle. He told NBC: 'I saw that it was a cop car. Right then I just started sprinting and did what I had to do.' 'On three, we just yanked. We basically ripped him out of the car,' Mr Chambers told Daily News. 'He was just mumbling in pain. He couldn't feel his legs. He was so in shock, he couldn't move.' A firefighter douses the flames of a police car after a pickup truck went into the side of it and left officer stuck . Meanwhile, other bystanders rushed to help the unconscious driver of the pickup truck to safety. Both drivers were taken to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania for treatment where they remain in a stable condition. Police said that Officer Kimsey suffered trauma to his head when the airbag was deployed and burns to his legs while the 52-year-old pickup driver also had head injuries. Mr Chambers also sustained minor scrapes and was taken to a nearby children's hospital before later visiting Officer Kimsey at his bedside, where they posed for a picture. The teenager has since been hailed a hero by the police force. John Stanford, a Philadelphia Police spokesman, wrote on Twitter: 'A uniform doesn't make a hero, courage and bravery does. A few young men saved a Philly police officer and citizen.' Joe Chambers had been watching an episode of hit US TV series 'Cops' which follows police on their duties . While the Leedom Fire Company, where he volunteered for three years, wrote on Facebook: 'Leedom fireman Joe Chambers assisted with removing a Philadelphia police officer from his car moments before it caught on fire tonight. 'Strong work brother! We are all very proud of you! We would like to send our best wishes for a speedy recovery along to the police officer and the passenger of the other vehicle.' Mr Chambers now plans to join the Marines or Army when he graduates from high school, but would like to become a police officer or firefighter, he told the Daily News.","Joe Chambers, 17, was watching show at home in Philadelphia on Saturday .

"Extra British troops are to be sent to Iraq to help in the battle against ISIS extremists, the government announced today. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the UK was 'stepping up' its military presence after a 'small specialist' team was sent to instruct Peshmerga in the northern city of Erbil last month. UK forces will offer further training to Iraqi soldiers and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Mr Fallon said during a visit to Iraq today. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon announced UK forces will offer further training to Iraqi soldiers and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters . The government stressed that combat troops were not being deployed to take on ISIS across large parts of Syria and Iraq. During his first visit to Iraq, Mr Fallon told the BBC: 'We are going to be stepping up our training effort. I can't give you precise numbers. I'm here to evaluate training needs and there are areas of expertise, particularly in counter-IED, roadside car bombs, where we can help from our experience in Afghanistan. 'So we will be putting in more training people to help at the training centres across the country, not just in the Kurdish areas.' Mr Fallon, who visited British army trainers teaching Peshmerga fighters how to use heavy machine guns given by the UK, insisted the Government remains clear that no combat troops will be deployed to Iraq. Under the expansion of the training mission, UK troops will teach Kurds infantry skills such as sharp-shooting and first aid, and more equipment will be provided. The UK will also send advisory personnel to Iraqi headquarters. Pressure has been growing to provide more assistance to new Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi as his country's forces struggle to reclaim territory in the north and west. The UK troops will teach Kurdish fighters skills such as sharp-shooting and first aid, and more equipment will be provided . Mr Fallon held talks in Baghdad with the premier as well as Iraqi security advisers before flying north to Erbil to met the President of the Kurdistan regional government Masoud Barzani and prime minister Nechirvan Barzani. He added: 'The need is now. It's a very immediate challenge from Isil. As they start to push Isil back out of the villages and towns that Isil have gone into they are going to need this kind of assistance with roadside bombs, particularly to counter the terror tactics that Isil have been using. 'So, we are looking very urgently now how we can get more training help to them in the next few weeks.' Asked about concerns of mission creep, he replied: 'This is a very limited mission. The Prime Minister's made it very, very clear we are not going to recommit combat troops to Iraq. We've been there, we've done that. 'What we are going to do is to help the new government of Iraq and its own army take the fight to Isil through the aircraft we have deployed in the sky, through intelligence gathering, and through specialist training.' British troops were part of the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 that overthrew Saddam Hussein, and later took responsibility for Basra and the south of the country. The last combat troops with Operation Telic, as it was called, left in April 2009, with a small number staying on to train Iraqi forces until 2011. RAF Tornado fighter-bombers have been taking part in US-led bombing raids on IS. But Prime Minister David Cameron has dismissed the prospect of sending in ground troops to fight the Islamist group, which controls swathes of Iraq and neighbouring Syria.","UK forces offer training to Iraqi soldiers and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters .

"A 49-year-old woman stands accused of brutally abusing her 7-year-old granddaughter while dressed up as her alter ego - a witch called 'Nelda'. Geneva Robinson of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma was arrested Tuesday on child abuse charges after taking her unnamed granddaughter to the hospital, saying she 'could not control' the girl anymore. Doctors reported that the girl was malnourished, and had bruises, burns and cuts all over her body. The girl told a Department of Human Services worker that her grandmother regularly dressed up as a witch wearing a green mask, hat and robe, to abuse her. The face of evil: Geneva Robinson of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma stands accused of physically abusing her 7-year-old granddaughter while dressing up as her alter ego - a witch named 'Nelda' She says Robinson would take her to the garage and make her sleep there on a pair on pants because 'she was in trouble'. Robinson allegedly used a dog leash to hang the girl from the garage ceiling by the armpits, telling her 'the creatures in the attic were going to come get her'. The report also says Robinson burned her and hit her with an orange and black whip, and threatened to cut her with a knife. When police searched Robinson's house, where she lives with three other children, authorities found the dog leashes and whip in the garage and the witch costume in the woman's bedroom. One of the boys who lives at the residence told police that Robinson once cut his finger with a pair of scissors and threatened to sever it as punishment for cutting the hair off a doll. Another child who lives there said Robinson picked on the 7-year-old, making her eat different food and sometimes alone in the garage. All four children who live with Robinson have been placed in the protection of DHS. Police have not said what relation the other three children had to Robinson. An adult who also lives in the home, and wished not to be named, allegedly told police that Robinson also abused him as Nelda, and that she kicked him in the genitals on a regular basis. But a man named Joshua, who refused to give his last name, told KFOR that he doesn't believe the allegations at all. 'It’s not true at all,' Joshua said, adding that the children who live there are troubled. 'She’s never dressed up as a witch to punish any of the kids.' Neighbors agreed: 'It’s just something I don’t believe because I’ve seen the kids and they look fine, they look happy,' said Heidi Campbell. Robinson was arrested on a charge of child abuse on Tuesday and booked in the Oklahoma County jail where she was held Wednesday in lieu of $10,000 bail.","Geneva Robinson was arrested Tuesday after her 7-year-old granddaughter complained about being abused by the 49-year-old woman .

"Long wait: Justin Welby said setting up credit unions to compete with controversial lenders such as Wonga will take 'major skills and much time' The Church of England’s rival to payday loan companies will not be ready to do business for more than ten years, the Archbishop of Canterbury admitted yesterday. Justin Welby said setting up credit unions to compete with controversial lenders such as Wonga will take ‘major skills and much time’. His admission amounts to a second climbdown since he promised to ‘compete Wonga out of existence’. His criticism of the company last month was rapidly followed by the disclosure that the Church’s pension fund had invested money in one of Wonga’s financial backers. The Archbishop said the responses to Lambeth Palace following his remarks on payday lenders had been ‘overwhelmingly positive’. However, he added: ‘Talk is cheap – and my job involves a lot of it – but the challenge is in delivery. 'The result of the interest in how the Church plans to support credit unions is that there is now, quite rightly, pressure to deliver. And it feels quite scary. 'Putting together the partnerships and logistics to have a good product, piloting it and learning from the results, and then turning it into something effective: This needs major skills and much time – at least a decade, in fact.’ The Archbishop made the admission in a blog published by Lambeth Palace while he was away on a brief visit to Guatemala. Waging war: Archbishop Welby opened his attack on Wonga (advert pictured) in an interview in which he said he had told the firm's chief that the Church of England would try to 'compete you out of existence' ‘I often admire politicians for putting themselves in a place which demands they turn words into reality. It is easy for me to criticise people from the sidelines; they are the ones trying to make things happen,’ he wrote. Archbishop Welby opened his attack on Wonga in an interview in which he declared: ‘I’ve met the head of Wonga and we had a good conversation and I said to him bluntly, “We’re not in the business of trying to legislate you out of existence, we’re trying to compete you out of existence”.’ He suggested that 16,000 churches could form the basis of a network of non-profit lending organisations.","Setting up credit unions to compete will take 'major skills and much time'

"Amie Miller died aged 15 of encephalitis, a disease which causes swelling of the brain . The parents of a schoolgirl who died after a catalogue of errors at a failing hospital told how they were forced to endure ‘five years of torture’ as they battled to find out the truth behind the tragedy. Amie Miller, 15, died of a brain injury just days after she was admitted to hospital with agonising headaches. Doctors failed to carry out basic neurological checks which might have saved her life. But nobody from the hospital would even meet the family – even though the mother worked at the hospital – to discuss their concerns for more than a year. They then had to fight for four more years to get an inquest. Yesterday, that inquest jury found medics at Basildon Hospital in Essex missed a string of opportunities to save Amie’s life in 2008. In a damning narrative verdict, they said staff had failed to take even the most basic steps – such as checking whether she could open her eyes, or examining the size of her pupils – which might have alerted them to her injury. Doctors also administered the wrong treatments – which may have made her condition worse. After the inquest, Amie’s stepfather Mbarek Aitmarri said the past five years had been torture. He said the hospital – which is under special measures and is one of 14 singled out for having high death rates – had ‘evaded’ responsibility for her death and had failed to respond to 81 allegations of negligence they had lodged. Mr Aitmarri, a pharmacy technician, said: ‘From the moment Amie died we faced constant evasion and were passed from one person to another. This has tortured us for the last five years.’ Amie's step-father Mbarek says his other children have struggled to cope and won't go to the doctor . Amie's step-dad Mbarek has said that he would never take another of his children to the hospital and would advise other parents to consider all their options first . He added: 'They knew what had gone wrong from day one and they didn't implement changes because it was not in their interests. 'You have incompetent staff and management that, I believe, are more focused on collecting a pay cheque than caring for people and that is a recipe for disaster. 'I'm not saying that everyone in the hospital is a rouge but it is the system that fails. The culture, the intimidation, and the lack of value for life.' Despite being singled out for its . abnormally high death rates, Basildon Hospital’s procedures ‘had not . changed’, Mr Aitmarri said. ‘For us there’s no doubt that systematic failings caused Amie’s death,’ he added. ‘Our daughter has been treated as collateral damage. I ask . myself every day whether, if I had taken her to another hospital, she . would still be alive.’ Speaking about the continued problems at the hospital, Mr Aitmarri said: 'There is no way I would take any of my other children there. 'They don't want to go to the doctor anymore. We now dread taking them to any hospital let alone Basildon. 'It is not for me to tell other people what to do with their children if they are sick but going to a hospital with such high profile problems, I would think twice and consider other options.' Amie was admitted to Basildon Hospital in Essex after suffering headaches, vomiting and fitting . His wife Sonia, Amie’s mother, added: ‘It took until 2009 for the . hospital to arrange a meeting and the doctors were very vague. We were . just passed backwards and forwards.’ Amie, a promising pupil who had dreamed of becoming a paediatrician, had . had severe headaches for seven days and had started vomiting and having . fits. She was taken to Basildon’s A&E department on November 16, . 2008. Dr Michel Sun Wai told the inquest he did not carry out basic tests on . November 17, because a colleague told him Amie’s condition had improved. 'A number of changes have since been . introduced in the treatment of children and adults with neurological . illness, including the introduction of more regular observations.' She died on November 19 of encephalitis, which causes swelling of the brain and is normally triggered by infection. The doctor said: ‘With hindsight the neurological observations should . have been done. But the handover to me was that the patient was waking . up and was getting better.’ The inquest at Chelmsford Coroners’ Court found a string of other . errors. Staff misinterpreted the results of a CT scan and failed to . carry out a MRI scan, despite one being recommended. In addition, a lumbar puncture, in which fluid is taken from the spine, may have exacerbated her condition. Amie was also given Propofol, a sedative only meant for adults, which . could have masked warning signs of brain damage. It is the drug linked . to the death of pop star Michael Jackson. Amie’s mother works as a pharmaceutical technician at Basildon Hospital, . and her husband admitted ‘it has been hard for her to work there’. Amie was kept on an adult ward at the hospital because of a shortage of beds at London's paediatric intensive care units . She paid tribute to her daughter, a pupil at Grays Convent High School . in Thurrock, saying: ‘She would be 20 if she were still alive. She . wanted to be a paediatrician and we are sure she would be at university . now. We miss her every day.’ The family said they would pursue regulatory, disciplinary and criminal action against the hospital. Mr Aitmarri said the tragedy had been hard on his other children as some of them had become introverted while others cried constantly. Despite this hardship he said the family would now work with solicitors to pursue regulatory, disciplinary and criminal action against the hospital. 'To stop here is just not fair to Amie and not just to any of her family' he said. 'Our legal claim is going to hopefully highlight the failures and those responsible for taking our daughter from us.' Tim Spring of Moore Blatch, who was the family's legal representative, said: 'Whilst we welcome today's conclusions by the jury and the specific criticisms made - we remain concerned. 'The length of time taken to establish and document a plan to prevent a re-occurrence of this type of incident was unacceptable in our view.' Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust . apologised for the blunders. A spokesman added: ‘A number of changes . have since been introduced in the treatment of neurological illness.’ The jury returned a narrative verdict.","Amie Miller was admitted to Basildon Hospital in Essex after she'd been vomiting and fitting .

"The Arctic front sweeping across the United States has got so cold that Hell has literally frozen over. As winter storm Hercules swept across the north of the country, the small town of Hell in Michigan saw temperatures plunge to -13C, with a wind chill of -33C. The sub-zero polar air caused snow several feet deep to freeze over - cutting off the 200 residents of Hell. Shops in the town have been forced to close up while snowed in neighbors helped each other stay warm. Scroll down for video . As winter storm Hercules swept across the north of the country, the small town of Hell in Michigan saw temperatures plunge to -13C, with a wind chill of -33C . Temperatures were so cold Tuesday that Hell literally froze over - that is, a small town in Michigan, pictured . Everything has shutdown in the ominously-named town of just over 200 people, and they all looked to help their neighbors . Map of the U.S. on Tuesday shows wind chill temperatures throughout the lower 48 states; wind chill advisories and warnings are in effect for 32 states from Montana to southern Florida . Bloomberg news Derek Wallbank revealed the town's plight, tweeting: 'Fun fact: it's currently -13 in Hell, MI, with a wind chill of -33. It has literally frozen over', while the story was also carried by Click on Detroit. But the town of Hell is not thought to take its name from the fiery pit of eternal torment and there are two different theories for the origins of the town's name. The first is that a pair of German travelers stepped out of a stagecoach one sunny afternoon in the 1830s, and one said to the other, 'So schön hell!' meaning 'So beautifully bright!'. Their comments were overheard by some locals and the name stuck. Another possible theory is that soon after Michigan gained statehood, George Reeves was asked what he thought the town he helped settle should be called and replied, 'I don't care, you can name it Hell for all I care'. In a rare turn of events, Hell, Norway, is warmer than its U.S. namesake. Temperatures were expected to reach as high as 5C on Wednesday, but will again drop below zero over the coming days. Its average January temperatures are between -4C and 3C. Meanwhile Lake Michigan was actually found to be steaming because of the freezing air. The storm has wreaked havoc across the U.S. after temperatures in the Midwest and East were colder than much of Antarctica on Tuesday. The big chill started in the Midwest over the weekend, and by yesterday it covered about half of the country. Changing places: Hell in Michigan was even colder than its namesake in Norway .

Across the south, temperatures dropped to record lows. Birmingham, Alabama, dipped to a low of -14C ( 7F), breaking the record of -11.7C (11F) set in 1970. So far 21 people have already died from the freezing conditions, including seven in Illinois, and six in Indiana. At least five people died after collapsing while shovelling snow, while several victims were identified as homeless people who either refused shelter or did not make it to a warm haven soon enough to save themselves from the bitter temperatures. Around 1,200 flights were cancelled from Chicago's two airports yesterday while more than 500 passengers were stranded overnight on three Chicago-bound trains that were stopped by blowing and drifting snow in Illinois. Food ran low, but the heat stayed on. Meanwhile many schools remained closed in Washington D.C. and Atlanta. In New York City, Central Park was 5F on Tuesday - the coldest January 7 since 1896. But the worst of the weather should be over in the next day or two. Warmer weather - at least, near or above freezing - is forecast for much of the stricken part of the country.

"If you ever need inspiration to hide the chocolate tin then Lorraine Fisher and her daughter Fay are it. The chocoholic duo  managed to lose eight stone combined after ditching their beloved treat. Lorraine, 45, and Fay, 19, from Lichfield, West Midlands, would munch on their favourite chocolate bars throughout the day, even skipping meals in favour of the snack. Then and now: Lorraine and Fay Fisher have managed to lose eight stone between them, right, by cutting out their favourite chocolate snacks . What a difference a year makes: Over the course of 15 months Fay lost more than five stone . Needs a new wardrobe: At her biggest Fay was a size 26 and felt unhappy about her body . Fay said: 'I used to eat at least four bars of chocolate a day - as well as chocolate on toast for breakfast and a chocolate pudding in the evening. But I hated how much weight I'd put on, I was a size 26 and couldn't look at myself in the mirror.' As a result of her sweet tooth, Fay weighed 18st 2lbs and said her size made her feel low in confidence. She said: 'People would call me fat and obese, and stare at me in the street. I couldn't fit in a pair of jeans, the only things I could ever wear was leggings.' It was an embarrassing incident abroad that was the last straw for Fay. She said: 'I was going on holiday with my friends to Greece and I couldn't fit the plane seat belt around me. I had to be given an extension and it was just mortifying. 'The holiday was horrible because I felt so awful - walking around in the heat made me so hot, and lying on the beach made me feel so uncomfortable. 'I realised I finally needed to sort my weight out, that's when I told Mum I was going to join Weight Watchers.' At the time, Lorraine was 16st 2lbs and had been advised by her doctors to lose weight. Thanks to her daughter's decision to diet, the mother-of-three decide the time was right for her to also finally try and beat the bulge. She explained: 'The doctors had referred me to a weight loss management programme, but apart from half a stone here and there I wasn't very successful. 'But when Fay told me she wanted me to go with her (to Weight Watchers) I thought it was the perfect opportunity. Before I was eating massive portions - I'd pile my food up into a mountain on my plate. I wouldn't eat anything at lunch, instead I'd just munch on chocolate and junk food throughout the day.' Bad habits: Before embarking on their diet Fay and Lorraine would snack on chocolate bars every single day, even having chocolate for breakfast . Transformed: Lorraine was told by her doctor that she needed to lose weight (left) but she struggled to get herself motivated before Fay decided to do it with her . Simmed down:  Fay proudly shows off her weightloss certificate  and new figure . The pair went to their first Weight Watchers meet just 15 months ago and haven't looked back. Fay, a student, has lost 5st 10lb, dropping to 12st 12lbs, while Lorraine has lost 2st 13lbs and is now 13st 5lbs. The pair said they couldn't have done it with each other's support. Lorraine revealed: 'It's been an amazing experience to have with my daughter. Fay has kept me going and her weight loss has been an inspiration to me. 'If it wasn't for her I'd have given up months ago. I feel so much better now and I go to the gym between four and five times a week.' Fay added: 'I couldn't have done it without my mum's support. We've been there for each other from the beginning and it's even brought us closer.' Fay and Lorraine managed to loose eight stone between them. Now they have a much healthier diet which includes a lot less chocolate! Breakfast . Four pieces of chocolate spread on Toast . Snack . Chocolate bar and pringles . Lunch . Sandwiches with lots of egg mayo . Snack . Chocolate bar . Dinner . Whatever Lorraine cooked - sometimes big portions of chicken and potato, with a warm chocolate pudding for dessert . Breakfast .

"Children born to older dads run a higher risk of having autism, psychiatric disorders and performing badly at school, researchers have warned. They found children conceived when fathers were 45 and older were on average three and a half times more likely to have autistic problems compared with the offspring of men in their early 20s. The risk was even higher at 24-fold for bipolar disorder and 13-fold higher for ADHD, says a report in JAMA Psychiatry journal. Children born to older dads, such as Simon Cowell, 54, run a higher risk of having autism, psychiatric disorders and performing badly at school, researchers have warned . Researchers warned that advancing paternal age posed a risk of ‘numerous public health and societal problems’. They said men should be advised about the potential problems in order to help their personal decision-making when it came to having fathering children at older ages. Among well-known older dads are Simon Cowell, 54, whose son was born earlier this month, and comedian Frank Skinner whose first child was born in 2012 when he was 55. Mounting research suggests the older age of parents might be partly responsible for growing numbers of children with autism. Autism is an umbrella term for a range of developmental disorders that have a lifelong effect on someone’s ability to interact socially and communicate. In the UK, around one in 100 adults is thought to be affected by autism, mostly men, caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Children born to fathers who are over 45 are three and a half times more likely to have autism. Frank Skinner was 55 when his first child was born . Experts think the link with paternal age could be explained by genetic errors creeping into sperm production as men get older, which build up over time. In the latest study, researchers studied people born in Sweden from 1973 to 2001 and estimated the risk of psychiatric problems such as autism, bipolar disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and academic trouble. The study used several models to establish estimates of risk depending on the father’s age, including comparisons of siblings, cousins and first-born cousins. It concluded there was a 3.5 fold higher risk of autism among children of fathers aged 45 and over, compared with dads aged 20 to 24 years old. Those born to older fathers had a 13-fold extra risk of ADHD, 24-fold higher risk of bipolar disorder, and double the risk of suicide attempts and substance abuse. There was also a higher risk of academic problems such as failing a grade and low attainment. Researcher Brian D’Onofrio, of Indiana University, Indiana, U.S., said: ‘Advancing paternal age is associated with an increased risk of psychiatric and academic morbidity, with the magnitude to risks being as large, or larger, than previous estimates.’ Dr D’Onofrio added: ‘We were shocked by the findings. ‘The specific associations with paternal age were much, much larger than in previous studies. In fact, we found that advancing paternal age was associated with greater risk for several problems, such as ADHD, suicide attempts and substance use problems, whereas traditional research designs suggested advancing paternal age may have diminished the rate at which these problems occur.’ Previous studies have shown that fathers aged 50 and older are more than twice as likely to have a child diagnosed with autism than younger fathers, while some research suggests older mothers may also be more at risk.","Those conceived to fathers over 45 are 3.5 times more likely to have autism .

"A baby died from catastrophic head injuries when his mother lost her grip and he fell on to an airport baggage carousel, witnesses revealed last night. Her screams rang out across the arrivals hall at Alicante airport bringing police rushing to the scene. The 32-year-old American tourist had just arrived in Spain from Gatwick with her Canadian husband and their two children. The baby was just five months old. Scroll down for video . The luggage belt where the child was tragically killed in Alicante airport. The mother is believed to have climbed on to the conveyer belt . Airport staff said the woman, who was also travelling with an older child, clambered onto the unmoving luggage belt . The parents were reportedly questioned about the tragic incident, and are being offered counselling . One theory under investigation is that . she climbed on to the belt to grab a pushchair which had become stuck in . the stationary chute. When it began to move, she apparently lost her balance and dropped the baby carrier, according to Spanish newspaper Informacion. Airport staff said the accident happened in seconds, giving the mother no time to react. An . airport worker added: ‘The youngster ended up trapped in a 10cm hole . where two belts converge. The boy appeared to have suffered from a . fractured skull.’ Other . witnesses said the mother was standing beside the carousel holding her . son and lost her grip as she leaned down to grab the pram. A . female easyJet worker said: ‘We heard the baby was in a carrier, but it . tipped over and his head became trapped in a gap while it was moving. It is so sad.’ The family are . believed to have travelled to the resort town of Denia, 60 miles from . the airport and are staying at the hotel where they were due to be . holidaying. The British Red . Cross has sent a psychologist and social worker to support them. An . airport spokesman said: ‘A woman was travelling with her baby and her . child on Wednesday when there was an accident. The mother's horrified cries brought airport personnel including police and security to the scene . A five-month-old baby has died after an horrific accident on a baggage collection belt at Alicante-Elche Airport (pictured) The baby boy was placed on the conveyer belt at Alicante airport (pictured) when it was activated and he was killed . ‘It all happened very quickly. The staff and the doctor went immediately to assist the baby but they could not help.’ The . spokesman dismissed police claims that the carousel had been stationary . when the ‘baby carrier’s weight activated the belt’, setting it in . motion. ‘It wouldn’t start automatically from something being placed on . it,’ she added. Spanish police said the  parents had been questioned and officers were investigating. Yesterday, . airport managers visited the scene to photograph the baggage belt, . which was meant specifically for larger items such as bicycles, . pushchairs and surfboards. A . 46-year-old woman from Essex, who had been waiting beside the carousel . when the accident happened, said: ‘It doesn’t look dangerous because it . is flat. I just can’t imagine how it happened.’ But . airport staff later said the woman, who was travelling with an older . child as well, clambered onto the luggage belt, after the pushchair got . stuck in a chute. As she couldn't reach it, she placed her foot on an 'automatic mechanism' which set the belt in motion. The mother’s horrified screams brought airport personnel, including police and security, to the scene. Medical . staff attempted to revive him but he had visible injuries to the head, . and appeared to have suffered a cranial fracture, Informacion reported. He was declared dead at the scene, in the baggage hall of Alicante- Elche airport. The baby was pronounced dead by the airport’s on-call . doctor. 'The youngster ended up trapped in a 10cm hole where two belts converge,' it said. 'The boy appeared to have suffered from a fractured skull.' There were reports that the family had to . wait until a judge arrived before the baby could be moved, in . accordance with Spanish law. Alicante Airport management company Aena said the baby was on the belt that delivers outsize luggage when the accident happened . Paramedics rushed to save the child's life at the airport but he was declared dead at the scene . The unnamed family had flown from London with budget airline easyJet. The . woman’s husband, who had been previously reported as travelling separately from his family, was reportedly with his children and partner in the baggage hall when the incident happened. After . disembarking from the plane shortly before midnight on Wednesday, the . mother and her two children entered the terminal and arrived at the . baggage reclaim area. Spanish police said the dead baby's parents have been questioned. A . spokesman for Guardia Civil in Alicante said: 'I can confirm the death . of a five month old baby at the airport. We are investigating the . causes. 'As part of the investigation the mother and father have been questioned.' A spokesman for the Forensic Anatomy Service in Alicante confirmed that a post-mortem had taken place. He said: 'The results of the tests will not be available for at least two weeks, and not until they are passed to the courts, who will review the case.' The family were said to be travelling to the nearby resort town of Denia and are staying at the hotel where they were . due to be holidaying as they deal with the aftermath of the tragedy. Civil Guard and National Police spokesmen confirmed that the mother is American and the father is Canadian, CNN reported. The Guardia Civil were the first to respond to the accident at the airport but she was declared dead at the scene . One airport worker said the baby boy was crushed by the conveyer belt after it was activated . Police sources said the boy's American mother had flown into Alicante-Elche Airport from Gatwick with the little boy and his older brother . Officials could not confirm the exact circumstances of the death. Passengers at Alicante airport appeared unaware of the tragedy as they stood next to the luggage belt to collect their pushchairs and . suitcases. A group of British men sat on the edge of the belt as . they waited for golf clubs, while a group of teenagers collected their . musical instruments. An emergency stop button was visible on both sides of the . belt, while a sign warned there was a 'risk of entrapment' and showed a picture . of a hand reaching out towards cogs. The Guardia Civil said it was investigating the incident, but said it was treating the matter as an accident. The family had just arrived for a holiday in the Spanish resort when the tragedy happened . A . spokesman said: ‘We are still in the early stages of the investigation . and looking at CCTV footage, but it seems that it was an accident. ‘The mother left the baby on the conveyor belt, which can be activated by detecting weight or by an airport employee. ‘It seems that the baby carrier’s weight activated the belt and the child was trapped in the rollers in the drop zone.’ A spokesman at the American embassy in Madrid said: 'The U.S. Embassy in Madrid is aware of the tragic death of a U.S. citizen child in Alicante and is providing appropriate consular assistance. 'Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment.' The Canadian Embassy in Madrid would not comment. Alicante . airport is the sixth busiest in Spain based on passenger numbers. It is . the main airport for the province, which is a popular summer holiday . destination for thousands of Britons, many of whom own homes in the . region. The weather there is . still sunny and warm, with temperatures nearing 30C (86F) this week, . making it an attractive destination as a cold spell grips northern . Europe. Last month, a two-year-old girl on holiday in the area fell into a swimming pool and drowned as her mother slept in a hammock nearby. Police . said Isabella May Crump was staying at a relative’s villa on the coast . with her parents, grandparents and four-year-old brother when the . tragedy happened. Her mother, Deborah Ridgway, 26, woke up to see her daughter’s body floating in the water.","Mother 'dropped baby when she climbed on to conveyer belt'

"The Duke and Duchess will attend a basketball game during a three-day visit to New York next month, Kensington Palace has revealed. The sporty couple will take courtside seats at a game set to take place on the second day of their three-day visit which will take in both the Big Apple and Washington DC. Both will be based in New York during the three-day trip, although Prince William will also spend part of the trip in Washington D.C where he will attend an anti-poaching conference. Heading to the Big Apple: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will visit New York next month . First visit: Neither the Duke nor Duchess have ever visited New York or Washington D.C before . The Duchess of Cambridge, meanwhile, will spend the entire visit in New York and is to visit a child development centre and host a lunch at the British Consulate while her husband is away. Contrary to earlier reports, Prince George won't be joining his parents on the trip and will remain in London with nanny, Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo. The visit is the couple's first to the US since 2011, when they travelled to Los Angeles, a few months after their wedding. This time, their visit will be confined to the East Coast - completely new territory for both as neither have previously visited it before, in any capacity. William and Kate will arrive on the evening of the 7th December and will spend their first night in the US at a private dinner on behalf of the American Friends of the Royal Foundation. The Foundation was set up by Princes Harry and William in 2009 and officially launched in 2011 as the main vehicle for their philanthropic activities, including the Invictus Games. In addition to promoting the welfare of current and former members of the Armed Forces, the Foundation also works with young people and is committed to supporting conservation efforts. Los Angeles: The couple's first US visit in 2011 was to California where they met Mayor Villaraigosa . Glamorous: They also hobnobbed with celebrities, among them singer and actress Jennifer Lopez . Not coming: The couple will travel to the US without Prince George who will remain in London . It is the latter that forms the basis for much of the schedule, with the Duke of Cambridge spending his first full day in the US at an anti-corruption conference at the World Bank in Washington D.C. Once there, the Duke is expected to call for a zero tolerance approach to the trade in endangered animal parts on behalf of United For Wildlife, a conservation organisation of which he is president. He will also attend a reception in New York for the Tusk Trust on the same day, before rejoining the Duchess of Cambridge to watch a basketball game. The following day, both the Duke and Duchess will visit an inner city youth organisation, focused on social support and learning for poorer children - another key focus for the Royal Foundation. Also on the agenda is an event celebrating the British creative talent boasted by New York's media and creative industries. Support: The couple attended the BAFTA Brits to Watch event during their 2011 visit to Los Angeles . On their way: The Duchess will spend the whole of the three-day visit in New York . Brits abroad: Anna Wintour and Piers Morgan are among the British media contingent working in the U.S . New York has long been a destination of choice for talented British journalists, among them Vogue's Anna Wintour and MailOnline Editor-at-Large (US), Piers Morgan, who lives in LA but spends much of his time in New York. Prince William, who like Prince Charles has long been fascinated with technology, will attend an event hosted by a New York-headquartered technology company, which will bring together entrepreneurs from both the UK and the US. The final engagement of the visit will be the University of St. Andrews 600th Anniversary Dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. St Andrews was the Scottish university where the Duke and Duchess first met in 2002 after enrolling on the same History of Art degree course. Since leaving the University, the Duchess in particular has become a regular attendee of alumni events, the majority in London. The New York event is along similar lines and will support scholarships and bursaries for students from underprivileged backgrounds, as well as new student sports facilities.","The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will visit New York and Washington .

"The Met Office has admitted that global warming has stalled. Officials say that by 2017, temperatures will not have risen significantly for nearly 20 years. They concede that previous forecasts were inaccurate – and have come under fire for attempting to ‘bury bad news’ by publishing the revised data on Christmas Eve. Rise: The earlier Met Office predictions show a much sharper rise in projected global temperatures through to 2016... Fall: But the new computer model predicts temperatures will stay relatively flat . Now a press release, published . yesterday, has confirmed that over the next five years temperatures will . be 0.43 degrees above the 1971-2000 average, instead of the previously . forecast 0.54 degrees – a 20 per cent reduction. This rise would be only slightly . higher than the 0.4-degree rise recorded in  1998, an increase which is . itself attributed by forecasters to an exceptional weather phenomenon. With all but 0.03 degrees of the . increase having occurred by 1998, the revision means that no further . significant increases to the planet’s temperature are expected over the . next few years. The figures have been seized on by . sceptics of man-made climate change, who claim that global warming has . flatlined despite a large rise in greenhouse emissions in recent . decades. Dr David Whitehouse, science adviser . to the Global Warming Policy Foundation, said: ‘That the global . temperature standstill could continue to at least  2017 would mean a . 20-year period of  no statistically significant change in global . temperatures. ‘Such a period of no increase will . pose fundamental problems for climate models. If the latest Met Office . prediction is correct, then it will prove to be a lesson in humility.’ Crack: Pieces of ice breaking away from a glacier in Patagonia, southern Argentina. Phenomena like this is believed by many to be caused by global warming . However, Dr Richard Allan of the . University of Reading said: ‘Global warming is not “at a standstill” but . does seem to have slowed down since 2000, in comparison to the rapid . warming of the world since the 1970s. ‘In fact, consistent with rising greenhouse gases, heat is continuing to build up beneath the ocean surface.’ He was backed by Bob Ward of the London School of Economics, who said it would be wrong to interpret that warming had stopped. However, he also condemned the Met Office for releasing data without an explanation of its full meaning. ‘It’s true to say this isn’t the Met Office’s finest hour,’ he said. ‘The sceptics have simply exploited . that fact. I think on this particular occasion the Met Office has fallen . short of the standards one would expect of them.’ Labour MP Graham Stringer said the Met Office’s short-term forecasts had improved, but their climate change analysis was ‘poor’. He said: ‘By putting out the . information on Christmas Eve they were just burying bad news – that they . have got their climate change forecast wrong. ‘For a science-based organisation, they should be more up front, both about their successes and failures.’ The Met Office said the updated . five-year predictions were a result of a new modelling system, which . takes into account changes in ocean surface temperatures, and was . released as soon as practically possible. Evidence: Temperatures will not rise as rapidly as feared, according to Met Office figures .

"A professor plans to send the first smell text message via a device he has dubbed the 'oPhone' A professor plans to send the first smell text message via a device he has dubbed the ‘oPhone’. David Edwards will send the scent through an app on his iPhone to a colleague in Paris. The oPhone will then decode the message and create the smell using different scents it has built inside of it. Professor Edwards, of Harvard’s school of engineering, believes that one day we could be sending smell messages as frequently as we do texts or pictures. He believes it is the world’s ‘natural Tweet’ as it takes just a few seconds to get it. If the test is a success he wants to have scent-tagged images available via Facebook and Twitter with oPhone-fitted hotspots around the world that can produce the odours. Professor Edwards will use an iPhone app called oSnap to compose his scent which has 32 unique smells that can be combined for a total of 300,000 possibilities. If he wants to create a pizza smell, for example, he would use scents like cheese, tomato and onion. The message will be received by Christophe Laudamiel, a perfumer and fragrance chemist at Le Laboratoire, a contemporary art and design centre in Paris. He will press his nose to one of the two small turrets of the oPhone, which looks like an old fashioned video game joystick. Professor Edwards said: ‘Scent is the world’s natural tweet, because it takes just a few seconds to get a scent. David Edwards will send the scent through an app on his iPhone to a colleague in Paris. The oPhone (pictured) will then decode the message and create the smell using different scents it has built inside of it . ‘The notion of people saying, “I miss you in New York,” by sending a scent is really interesting and powerful. Or imagine taking a scent selfie and posting it on Facebook.’ Professor Edwards said he plans to launch a crowdsourcing campaign to fund his company Vapor Communications so it can manufacture oPhones on a large scale. They will be available for pre-sale and will be produced in early 2015 for $149, or around £100. Professor Edwards said that he hoped it would be used in bakeries and coffee shops where smell is important. He said: ‘In the near term, we’ll go where there are obvious business applications - places where the quality of aroma is associated with the quality of the product or experience’. Technology has tried for decades to work out a way to send smell messages to the public. Newspapers have long used ‘scratch n sniff’ for perfume adverts and gimmicky giveaways. In the 1950s ‘Smell-o-Vision’ was introduced to cinemas which released an odour as a film played so that the audience could smell what was going on. For many people a hearty fried breakfast including a couple of rashers of bacon is a desirable way to start the day. But . as cooked breakfast or a bacon sandwich isn’t the healthiest option, a . new iPhone app and device that wafts the appealing smell of the cured . meat could prove to be a more sensible option. The alarm clock app wakes a person up with the sound of sizzling bacon, while a connected scent device emits a bacon perfume. The ‘wake up and smell the bacon’ app has been developed by Oscar Mayer – a manufacturer of bacon and other meats in the U.S. While the iPhone app is readily available and free to download, the accompanying device is not for sale, but a limited were devloped by the company as part of a competition that ran in April.

"Whether it's working up the nerve to ask your boss for a pay rise or finally plucking up the courage to ask the handsome guy from the gym for a date, there's no shortage of situations where a little extra courage wouldn't hurt. But, while many overcome their nerves, studies have shown that women are more likely to succumb to a lack of confidence - with disastrous results for their career and love life. Now, a new blog aims to help women face down their fears by encouraging them to submit photos revealing what they would do if they weren't afraid. This woman thinks she's worth more than she's paid but is afraid to ask for a rise . One poster would learn to ignore negativity while another would be brave and pitch that book . Called What Would You Do If You Weren't Afraid, the blog is hosted on Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In website and was inspired by a speech she made at Barnard University. 'The inspiration for the project came . from a speech Sheryl gave to the graduating class at Barnard a few years . go that ended with the question 'What would you do if you . weren't afraid?', says LeanIn.Org editor, Jessica Bennett. 'As graduation rolled around this year, we wanted to find a way to play . off that question to encourage women to pursue their ambitions -- but . this is clearly a message that women (and many men) of any age can . relate to.' Among the women who have already submitted photos is Rani, 15, from West Lafayette in Indianapolis who writes: 'I would LEAD without worrying what people think + prefacing my ideas with ""maybe"" or ""I don’t know, but…""' The blog is hosted on the website of Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg (pictured) Jennifer Evers from Chicago would take more control of her own life and stop going with the flow . Another, Jennifer Evers, 43, from Chicago, writes: 'I’ve taken the first step and created a career and business for myself that I can fit my life in to, instead of trying to fit my life in to someone else’s idea of what a career for me should be. 'Now I need to take the next step and fully take ownership of everything… professional and personal.' Sandberg herself has also submitted a photo and a pledge that reads: 'I would write a book about women.' 'We wanted to make the point that women . often hold themselves back by fear of the unknown: fear of failure, fear . of speaking up, fear of being judged,' added Jessica. 'Part of leaning in is about . overcoming our fears to pursue our ambitions -- whatever those may be. So why not put our fears out there? 'Why not talk about them? Hold them . up on a sign? We hope this blog will inspire women to ask themselves, . 'What would I do if I weren't afraid?' And then to go and do it.'

"A Syrian mother of seven was so determined to . help fight against Bashar Al Assad that she divorced her husband to lead a 40-strong women’s brigade. Khowleh, . the name she adopted after the uprising began, started the brigade in February 2012 and the women fought on the frontlines with guns. But the 35-year-old has now been forced to abandon the Khowleh bint Al Azwar brigade and lives as a refugee in Irbid, Jordan, 20 kilometres from the Syrian border. Warrior queen: Khowleh was so determined to help in the uprising that she turned her back on her life and started the Khowleh bint Al Azwar brigade, pictured . When the uprising began Khowleh did not support it and dismissed news of unarmed protesters being shot dead in the streets, reports The National. But her stance changed a month later after when she attended a funeral of a doctor who was shot dead while treating wounded civilians. 'I saw the body in a coffin and from that moment I was with the revolution, I started taking part in protests that day,' she said. She was so incensed that she joined demonstrations to help the revolution. Soldiers loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad cheer while raising their weapons in Aleppo . Battle: A Free Syrian Army fighter aims his weapon through a hole in a wall in Aleppo's Salaheddine neighbourhood . But her new found politics did not please her husband, who she had married when she was 15 and lived with in Hirak, Khowleh. When he demanded that she pick him or the cause, she choose her brigade and the couple divorced. Khowleh used her gender to her advantage when helping to free local men as women were targeted less on visits to military bases and checkpoints - she helped free 15 men. Aid: Two Syrian women carry their children as other women stand in line waiting to collect aid from relief agencies helping refugees . Torn apart: Children walk past damage that was caused by shelling from forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in Duma . Although she was arrested on one venture and held for several days, Khowleh was not deterred. In early 2012 Khowleh began to smuggle weapons through checkpoints - she had lost faith in the power of peaceful protest as the bloodshed had increased. Along with 40 other women she started a brigade -  the Khowleh bint Al Azwar, named after a female Arab warrior from the 7th century. 'We were taught how to use rifles at school as part of our military youth training,” she said. 'We knew how to fire a Kalashnikov and had been instructed in how to properly throw hand grenades, so it wasn’t difficult for us.' Flee: Syrian families leave the besieged town in eastern Ghouta, which is controlled by opposition fighters, in Damascus countryside . Members of the Internal Security Forces ride on their vehicle in front of a poster of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad and his father, former Syrian President Hafez al-Assad . The women fought alongside all male-brigades, but they disbanded after thousands of people fled and members became fewer. Khowleh left the country late last year because she had no-one to look after her children. They now live in a refugee camp, although she longs to return to the brigade. She says she finds life in the camp harder than fighting on the front lines in Syria. She is keen to return to Syria when the bloodshed ends, but is wary of what the new nation could like like. This morning the leader of one of Syria's most prominent rebel units died of wounds sustained during a strike by government forces last week, his group said, dealing another blow to fighters reeling from a series of recent battlefield losses. The death of Abdul-Qadir Saleh, founder of the Tawhid Brigade, followed advances by President Bashar Assad's troops against rebels on two key fronts: the capture of a string of opposition-held suburbs south of Damascus and the taking of two towns and a military base outside the northern city of Aleppo. An ongoing offensive meanwhile is driving hundreds of refugees into neighboring Lebanon, as government forces seek to dislodge rebels from a mountainous area that stretches north of the Syrian capital. A total of 6,000 have crossed to a Lebanese border town over the last three days, the U.N. says. Meanwhile Syria's ambassador to Russia said insufficient funding and unspecified actions by militants fighting to oust President Bashar al-Assad are hindering the government's compliance with a deal to abandon chemical weapons, the Interfax news agency reported on Monday. 'The main obstacles to Syria fulfilling its commitments (are) the lack of provision of the funding necessary to fulfill this task,' Ambassador Riad Haddad was quoted as saying. 'On top of that, armed groups are creating hindrances to satisfying the agreement's conditions.'","Khowleh is a mother of seven and left her husband to take part in uprising .

"Buddy of the bees: Environment Secretary Liz Truss urges Brits to stop mowing their lawns . It  is a chore many could do without. And now we have Government backing not to bother mowing the lawn – because it will help bees. Environment Secretary Liz Truss will today sanction a nation of messier lawns for the benefit of our dwindling bee population. Making her first major speech since she was given the cabinet position in the summer, the Conservative politician will say that bees benefit from the wildflowers allowed to grow free. ‘People can help pollinators in their garden at home or the local park or school space,’ she will tell an audience at the Policy Exchange think tank. ‘Oxeye daisies, lavender, primroses, cyclamen, they are just a few of the common flowers that are bee-friendly. ‘I have to confess that not mowing your lawn so often is one piece of advice that I have no problem following.’ The number of wild bees in Britain are thought to have halved in the last 25 years, and other pollinating insects such as butterflies and moths are also struggling. Miss Truss will highlight insects’ role in agriculture, where they play a vital role in pollinating crops. She will say: ‘Without those insects, not only would our parks, gardens and countryside be much more drab places, our food could well become less varied and some of it more expensive.’ The loss of the nectar insects feed on is partly to blame for their decline, with 97 per cent of our meadows and their carpets of wildflowers having disappeared since the 1930s. The new National Pollinator Strategy, published today, encourages farmers to cultivate strips of land for wildflowers. And schools, businesses and local authorities are asked to plant nectar-rich plants on their land. But householders are also asked to do their bit, by allowing a patch of land to grow wild, selecting bee-friendly plants, or simply allowing part of their lawn to grow go un-mown. Experts advise that lawns not be cut after September to protect bumble bee nests in the grass. It also allows caterpillars nesting in the ground to survive until spring. By not mowing  lawns and allowing wildflowers to grow, Britain can help the dwindling bee population . Those who have space could even allow parts of their lawn to grow wild year-round, the strategy says. A recent project conducted by at two sites owned by Thames Water found that cutting the grass less often and instead sowing wild flower seed boosted bee numbers by 37 per cent. Miss Truss will also call for a new debate over the environment, which until now been a polarised ‘slanging match’ between ‘hippies and gas-guzzlers’. Defending the Coalition’s environmental record, she will insist that she and her colleagues are still committed to their pledge to be the ‘greenest government ever’. She will say: ‘To achieve that, the debate has to get beyond experts and special interest groups, beyond targets and summits, beyond the polarised slanging match we so often hear: you’re an alarmist or a denier, a hippy or a gas-guzzler. ‘The reality is different. We are making environmental and economic progress. They are not just compatible - they depend on each other.’ Bee a friend: Bees play a vital role in pollinating crops, but the number of wild insects is thought to have halved in the last 25 years . She will also call for a new approach to the environment, with fewer restrictions and greater enjoyment. ‘Ever since can remember, the environment has been presented as something worthy. ‘It’s been all about behaving yourself: sort out your rubbish or else; feel guilty about buying more stuff; take fewer flights. ‘It’s all been about having less but it can – and should – be about having more. ‘A clean, beautiful, healthy natural environment is about more jobs and greater prosperity, contributing to our long-term economic plan, our wellbeing and our future security.’ Green groups last night praised the minister’s rhetoric, but said she needs to match it with action. Andrew Pendleton, head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth, said: ‘This action plan is an important step towards safeguarding Britain’s bees and other pollinators - but unless it properly tackles the impact of pesticides and helps all farmers to develop bee-friendly practices its effectiveness will be significantly undermined. ‘Tens of thousands of people have backed Friends of the Earth’s Bee Cause campaign for a national action plan. They will expect a robust strategy capable of saving our bees. ‘Bees are crucial pollinators for our farms, gardens and countryside – failure to protect them from every threat they face will have a costly impact on us all.'","Environment Secretary Liz Truss urges Britain to stop mowing lawns .

"Freak accident: Ian McKeever died after he was struck by lightning on a climbing expedition on Mount Kilimanjaro . A well-known Irish climber has been killed in a freak tragedy while scaling Africa's highest mountain. Ian McKeever, 42, was struck by lightning as he led a group up Mount Kilimanjaro, one of many expeditions the experienced adventurer has organised on the Tanzanian peak. Others in the group also hit by the lightning storm needed medical treatment for minor burns and shock, but their injuries were not thought to be life-threatening. The latest expedition left Ireland for Tanzania on December 28 and began their ascent the day before New Year’s Eve. In online updates, Mr McKeever wrote that there was torrential rain but spirits remained high among the hikers. In his final post he said: ‘We pray for dryer weather tomorrow - the big day. It's the Lava Tower.’ The Lava Tower is a landmark on the climb. Taoiseach Enda Kenny led tributes to the climber. He said: ‘I had come to know him over recent years and I admired him not only for his own achievements and charity work but also for his work with young people in challenging them to achieve their full potential.’ Mr Kenny recalled getting text updates from Mr McKeever when he led an expedition of students from schools in the Taoiseach's native Castlebar to Kilimanjaro's 5,895metre-high summit. He added: ‘He was extremely passionate about what he did and driven in his belief that everybody can achieve their potential during their lifetime. ‘Ian said to me once that there was no place he would rather be than in the mountains. ‘I would like to extend my sympathies to his fiancee Anna and his family, friends and fellow adventurers.’ A lecturer and broadcaster from Lough Dan in Co Wicklow, Mr McKeever regularly mentored hikers, including many Irish schoolchildren, through his Kilimanjaro Achievers organisation. Experienced: Mr McKeever had led previous expeditions and was known for many feats including scaling Mount Everest (pictured) He was known for many feats, including scaling Mount Everest. In 2008, the adventurer helped his then ten-year-old godson Sean McSharry become the youngest person in Europe to reach the top of Kilimanjaro. Mr McKeever is the former record holder for completing the seven highest peaks in the world. In 2009, he was part of a team that attempted to row the South Atlantic Ocean in under 30 days, but the boat lost its rudder and they were forced to postpone the attempt. More recently he had been attempting, along with African climbing guide friend Samuel Kinsonga, to break the record for the fastest ascent of Kilimanjaro, as part of their anti-racism Black and White Makes Sense Campaign. He was the author of two books Give Me Shelter and Give Me Heroes and was working on a third book Give Me 28 Days. On his Facebook page, a statement read: ‘It is with deep regret, that we, Ian's family, fiancee Anna and friends, advise of his sudden death on Kilimanjaro, today, doing what he loved best.’ Mr McKeever is pictured with a friend  on the Summit of Elbrus, at 18,481ft,  one of seven highest mountains in each continent the climber conquered in a record 156 days . Tributes referred to him as an inspiration. His fiancee Anna was with him during the ill-fated climb. Arrangements are currently being made to make Mr McKeever's remains available to his family, some of whom are travelling to Tanzania. The Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed it was helping. A spokesman said: ‘We are providing consular assistance.’ Mountaineer Pat Falvey, who described the death as a complete and utter freak accident, said his friend was an inspiration to young people and a dreamer, who pushed himself to achieve very difficult goals. He said: ‘When I heard it last night I just couldn't believe that it happened where it has. Mr McKeever had led many expeditions to the 5,895metre-high summit of Mount Kilimanjaro (pictured) ‘We've all lost friends in the high mountains, but to feel that he was doing what he was doing, helping and mentoring others to achieve goals, and in such a simple way, to be taken out of it,’ he said. Adi Roche, of Chernobyl Children International, said Mr McKeever would always be one of her heroes and paid tribute to his enthusiasm, wisdom, humour, vibrancy and vision. ‘He had unstoppable energy and had such a 'can do' philosophy in life,’ she said. ‘He never saw a dark side to anything and met every challenge with sheer determination. ‘Ian was a once-off model and after they created him they threw away the mould.’","Ian McKeever was on one of many climbing expeditions he had organised .

"Samuel L. Jackson has blasted Barack Obama for 'promoting mediocrity' in the United States by 'dumbing down' the way he speaks to ordinary Americans. In an expletive-filled tirade about - of all things - grammar, Jackson told the President to 'be f*****g presidential.' The Holywood legend, who publicly backed Obama in 2008 and 2012, questioned why the Harvard-educated former law professor chooses to drop the letter 'g' from the end of his words. In an astonishing rant, Jackson, 64, said that the President was trying too hard to 'relate' to normal people instead of being true to who he really is. Scroll down for video .

Jackson's attack has been described by some as 'ironic' after the Pulp Fiction star agreed to appear in a video called 'Wake the f**k up. Vote for Obama' during the last election.

Jackson, himself a university graduate, having studied acting at Morehouse College, Atlanta, said he gets annoyed when high profile figures try to talk in 'street language' to appear more down-to-Earth. He continued his rant by saying educated men like the president who actively try to speak less correctly encourage mediocrity. He said: 'The other day I’m watching this white guy talking to black people on TV, and all of a sudden he’s saying stuff like “Pump your brakes” and “I got you,” these new politically cool terms that kind of came out of hip-hop and blackness.

"Syrian intelligence agencies are running torture centres across the country where detainees are beaten with batons and cables, burned with acid, sexually assaulted, and their fingernails torn out, a report released today has said. Human Rights Watch identified 27 detention centres that it says intelligence agencies have been using since President Bashar al-Assad's government began a crackdown in March 2011 on pro-democracy protesters trying to oust him. The New York-based rights group found that . tens of thousands of people had been detained across Syria. It conducted more than 200 interviews with people who said they were tortured. Scroll down for video . Torture: This graphic shows one of the methods used by Syrian intelligence agencies to torture detainees. With Dulab the victim is forced to bend at the waist and stick his head, neck, legs and sometimes arms into the inside of a car tire . Awful: Some of those being held in the torture centres would be beaten with objects including cables, whips, sticks, batons and pipes . Painful: Shabeh is another torture method which was used on detainees. It involved hanging the victim from the ceiling by the wrists . This included a 31-year-old man who was detained in the Idlib area in June and made to undress. He told the group: 'They started squeezing my fingers with pliers. They put staples in my fingers, chest and ears. I was only allowed to take them out if I spoke. The staples in the ears were the most painful.' 'They used two wires hooked up to a car battery to give me electric shocks. They used electric stun-guns on my genitals twice. I thought I would never see my family again. They tortured me like this three times over three days,' he said. The report was released as it emerged Syrian President Bashar Assad claims he regrets the shooting down of a Turkish jet by his forces last month. Inhumane: This map shows the various locations and descriptions by some of those who claimed they were tortured by Syrian intelligence agencies . Turkish newspaper The . Cumhuriyet quoted Mr Assad as saying: 'I say 100%, I wish we did not shoot it down.' The Human Rights Watch report found that tens of thousands of people had been detained by the Department of Military Intelligence, the Political Security Directorate, the General Intelligence Directorate, and the Air Force Intelligence Directorate. The reports documented by the group match those of a former Syrian intelligence officer who told how he was routinely ordered to torture prisoners. Speaking to CNN, the former officer, who later fled to Turkey with his family, said: 'Whatever we wanted the prisoner to say, he would say.  We took their fingernails out with pliers and we made them eat them. We . made them suck their own blood off the floor.' Unbearable: Basat al-reeh involves tying the victim down to a flat board with the head suspended in the air so the victim cannot defend himself . Abuse: Electrocution was also used on those being held in the 27 torture centres . Harsh: Falaqa involves beating the detainee with sticks, batons, or whips on the soles of the feet . Horrific: Human Rights Watch has identified 27 detention centres that it says intelligence agencies have been using since President Bashar al-Assad's government began a crackdown on pro-democracy protesters . Human Rights Watch documented more than 20 torture methods that 'clearly point to a state policy of torture and ill-treatment and therefore constitute a crime against humanity.' The group called for the U.N. Security Council to refer the issue of Syria to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and to adopt targeted sanctions against officials carrying out abuse. 'The reach and inhumanity of this network of torture centers are truly horrific,' Ole Solvang, emergencies researcher at Human Rights Watch said.

"Mystery has surrounded the death of Yuri Gagarin, the first man to journey into space . Yuri Gagarin made history in 1961 when, aged just 27, he became the first man to journey into space. His single Earth orbit on April 12 lasted 108 minutes and was one of the Soviet Union's most enduring Cold War victories. Seven years later, the Russian cosmonaut was killed in a crash during a training flight - an event that has been shrouded in mystery ever since. Among the conspiracy theories were that he was murdered on the orders of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev for an unspecified offence or disloyalty to the party; Gagarin had committed suicide; or that the plane had actually hit a UFO. Kremlin archives declassified in early 2011 concluded that his MiG jet had swerved to avoid a weather balloon, causing the plane to go into a tailspin and hit the ground, killing him instantly. But after 40 years of secrecy,  the real cause of Gagarin's death can be revealed, courtesy of fellow cosmonaut Aleksey Leonov. Leonov, who was the first man to make a spacewalk, in 1965, had been part of an official committee set up to investigate the accident. More importantly, he had been there on that fateful day in March. And now, following the release of a . newly declassified report - which Leonov has been allowed to make public - . the 79-year-old can finally reveal the actual chain of events; something . he has wanted to do for 20 years. Seen here in 1963 are Yuri Gagarin (centre) with Soviet Communist Party First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev. Five years later, the Russian cosmonaut died in a crash during a training flight . Aleksey Leonov, who was the first man to make a . spacewalk, in 1965 (pictured), had been part of an official committee set up to . investigate the accident. More importantly, he had been there on that . fateful day in March when Gagarin's MiG went into a tailspin after apparently hitting a weather balloon, and crashed to the ground . 'That [original] conclusion is believable to a civilian, not to a professional - but in fact, everything went down differently,' Leonov told Russia Today. He explained that an unauthorised SU-15 fighter jet was flying dangerously close to Gagarin’s aircraft. Leonov said: 'In this case, the pilot didn’t follow the book, descending to an altitude of 450 metres. 'I know this because I was there; I heard the sound and talked to witnesses. 'While afterburning, the aircraft reduced its echelon [plane formation] at a distance of 10-15 metres in the clouds, passing close to Gagarin, turning his plane and thus sending it into a tailspin – a deep spiral, to be precise – at a speed of 750 kilometres per hour,' he told the Russian website. Leonov was well-placed to give such testimony. He had overseen parachute jump training at Chkavlovsky airfield, northeast of Moscow - from where Gagarin had set out. At this point in his career, Gagarin was Deputy Training Director of the Cosmonaut Training Centre and was starting out as a fighter pilot again (as he had been in 1960). After being allowed to make public his remarks after a newly declassified report was released, Leonov revealed that an unauthorised SU-15 fighter jet (file picture, above) was flying dangerously close to Gagarin's aircraft. It was this that caused his plane to go into a spin and crash . Above, a statue of Gagarin outside the British Council's headquarters in central London . Major Yuri Gagarin at a reception at Earls Court for the Soviet Trade Exhibition . Due to bad weather, Leonov had been awaiting official confirmation that exercises would be cancelled that day, March 27. He then heard a supersonic sound followed by an explosion seconds later. Reports of the calamity, near the village of Novoselovo, soon filtered back to the base. Leonov formed part of the State Commission investigating the accident - and after finally gaining access to it, he discovered a litany of distorted facts. Even though his comments had his name attached, they had been written by someone else. 'Marked here was a sonic spike, a blast, followed by one-and-a-half or two seconds of supersonic noise... So, when I looked at the copy, I suddenly noticed that it stated this noise interval to be 15 to 20 seconds long instead of the two seconds that I had reported. 'That suggested that the two jets must have been no less than 50km apart,' he told RT. Leonov knew that Gagarin's jet had plunged for 55 seconds at a speed of 750km, and made his own calculations. 'We used a computer to figure out a trajectory that would relate to this interval of 55 seconds. And it turned out to be a deep spiral. Now, a jet can sink into a deep spiral if a larger, heavier aircraft passes by too close and flips it over with its backwash. 'And that is exactly what happened to Gagarin. That trajectory was the only one that corresponded with all our input parameters.' However, there remains one further question - who was the other pilot? The man responsible for the death of Gagarin is still alive, aged 80, and in poor health. But as part of the deal of him going public, Leonov has been sworn to secrecy, and has promised never to reveal his identity. Yuri Gagarin as a student at Saratov Industrial College in 1955 . The 19 candidates selected for the Vostok-1 flight were all test pilots, unafraid of speed, and slight enough in build to fit into the tiny 2m-wide (6ft) capsule. The Soviet-era charm of Gagarin's humble roots may have favored him over others, including his backup Gherman Titov. Born in the village of Klushino, some 150km (95 miles) west of Moscow, Gagarin's father was a carpenter and his mother a milkmaid. The family was forced to live in a tiny mud hut when the village was burned down during the German occupation in World War Two. 'Yura (Gagarin) was a very quick learner. He assimilated everything new. His mind was stellar,' veteran Soviet space journalist Vladimir Gubarev said. Gagarin sung Soviet hymns during the last checks, strapped atop the 30m-high (98 ft) rocket that would blast him into space from the long-secret Baikonur cosmodrome on the Kazakh steppe. 'Poyekhali! (Let's go!),' he cried, in a phrase that has become synonymous with Gagarin in Russia. 'The most emotional moment was when we heard he was walking and waving; his arms and legs were whole. 'We understood in one sigh that our five to six years of hard work had paid off and we had achieved something huge,' veteran cosmonaut Georgy Grechko said. The United States responded 10 months later, when John Glenn made the first U.S. orbital flight.

"Human trafficking gangs are getting away with millions of pounds in profits because the police have no incentive to freeze their assets, Home Secretary Theresa May is warned today. MPs warn new laws to tackle modern-day slavery do not enough to hit gangmasters 'where it hurts' by confiscating cash immediately. They urge Mrs May to follow the example of US gangster Al Capone who was 'brought down in the 1930s through his finances'. Home Secretary Theresa May says the Modern Slavery Bill will ensure those involved in the 'disgusting trade' will be arrested, prosecuted and jailed . The Modern Slavery Bill gets its third reading in the Commons today, with the government boasting that it will ensure those involved in the 'disgusting trade' will be arrested, prosecuted and jailed. But amendments to the bill tabled by a cross-party group of MPs warn it fails to target the root of the trade in vulnerable people, by seizing profits made by traffickers. They argue that profits generated by trafficking gangs can run to million pounds a week in single towns, but police fail to follow the money. A major obstacle is said to be rules which mean most of the money which is recouped is taken by the Home Office, leaving police forces with little incentive to prioritise the funding. Tory MP Stephen Barclay, who has backed changes to the law with Labour MP Frank Field, said: 'For too long, illegal gangmasters have been getting away with keeping their massive profits even on the rare occasion they get caught'. In an article for MailOnline he added: 'The police need the ability to freeze the assets of illegal traffickers within the first 24 hours. 'At present it takes many months and by then offenders have dissipating their assets before they can be confiscated. 'A further change needed to the Bill is for assets that are recovered to be returned - after compensating victims - to the investigating Police force and the Gangmaster’sLicensing Authority (GLA) rather than the Home Office.' Critics warn not enough is done to seize the assets and cash of those involved in trafficking, because police forces are not incentivised to do so . He adds: 'The Home Secretary is to be commended for delivering the Anti Modern Slavery Bill. Yet only if it tackles organised crime through more effective financial controls will it deliver the operational change that is required.' Under the Bill, the maximum sentence for the most serious offenders is increased from 14 years to life imprisonment. Those who have a previous conviction for a serious sexual or violent offence face an automatic life sentence. Ministers say it will also ensure that perpetrators convicted of slavery or trafficking 'face the toughest asset confiscation regime'. Launching the bill in June, Mrs May said: 'Modern slavery is an appalling crime that has no place in today’s society. 'It is an affront not just to the dignity and humanity of the people crushed by it but to every one of us. 'This Bill presents an historic opportunity to get legislation on the statute books specifically targeting the scourge of modern slavery.' Tory MP Stephen Barclay warned the legislation fails to 'follow the money' of gangmasters . The gangster Al Capone was brought down in the 1930s through his finances, but modern police forces are slow to follow suit when fighting today's organised criminals. The Modern Slavery Bill Third Reading before Parliament today is the perfect opportunity to change the law so that those exploiting vulnerable workers can be targeted through their finances. For too long, illegal gangmasters have been getting away with keeping their massive profits even on the rare occasion they get caught. These profits can run to several million pounds a week in one rural town alone in my farming constituency, according to local Police sources. The crux of the problem is the speed at which assets are frozen before crooks and their advisors can move them, and the lack of financial incentives for enforcement agencies investigating complex financial arrangements. First, the police need the ability to freeze the assets of illegal traffickers within the first 24 hours. At present it takes many months and by then offenders have dissipating their assets before they can be confiscated. This requires the Bill to lower the evidential burden, so that it can be presumed assets have been obtained illegally through trafficking in certain scenarios. Yet making it quicker and easier to freeze the assets of traffickers is not enough if the incentivises for law enforcement to investigate are not in place. A further change needed to the Bill is for assets that are recovered to be returned - after compensating victims - to the investigating Police force and the Gangmaster’sLicensing Authority (GLA) rather than the Home Office. At present there is little incentive for a Chief Constable under resource pressure to appoint additional financial investigators, if it takes years to recover the money and this is then largely swallowed up by the Home Office. The role of supposedly respectable financial advisors to illegal traffickers also needs to be addressed in the Bill. Criminal accounts by their nature are profitable. Too many financial firms hide behind the simple process of filing a suspicious activity report before continuing to trade - and taking their commission. So a higher duty of care is needed for financial institutions when arrests are made but prior to a restrain order being granted. Clearer disclosure requirements are also needed for financial institutions regarding patterns of client activity in known trafficking hot spots - such as a trafficker who has ownership of workers bank cards and makes multiple withdrawals from the same cash point using the same pin but with a multitude of different cards. Likewise rogue gangmasters are able to make multiple payments into a single bank account which should trigger action by the bank. The way that gangmaster’s pay their workers also needs to change so there is a clearer audit trail - as has recently been introduced for the scrap metal industry. At the moment, a farmer may pay a gangmaster for work in cash, in the form of say 15 brown envelopes with £150 in them each for each of the workers. However, instead of this going to each worker the exploiter will cross off £20 for accommodation, £30 for travel after they are given the envelope so that what the workers are ending up with is only a fraction of what the farmer thinks he is paying. By workers being paid either through electronic transfer or by cheque the power is removed from the hands of the Gangmaster and means not only should the worker receive their proper wage, but there is a documented trail of payments for the police to investigate if irregularities are suspected. If a rogue gangmaster then wanted to take these wages, they would have to take their workers to a bank or cash point, and take the money directly off them, at which point the police would have a strong case to prosecute them for theft. The Home Secretary is to be commended for delivering the Anti Modern Slavery Bill. Yet only if it tackles organised crime through more effective financial controls will it deliver the operational change that is required. According to the GLA, those trafficked to the UK for labour exploitation exceeded those for sexual exploitation for the first time last year. It is time to follow the money.","Call for police forces to keep cash and assets taken from gangmasters .

"It may seem hard to believe that such an unusual looking animal has remained hidden for so long. But scientists have only just discovered a new species of elephant shrew – or round-eared sengi - in the remote deserts of south western Africa. While it is the smallest known member of the 19 sengis in the order Macroscelidea, the small creature is in fact genetically more closely related to an elephant than a true shrew. Cute: Scientists have discovered a new species of elephant shrew - or round-eared sengi (pictured) - in the remote deserts of south western Africa . The Etendeka round-eared sengi, or Macroscelides micus, was found in a remote part of the Namid Desert in south western Africa. It is the smallest of all elephant shrews or sengis. The animal is the third new species of sengi to be discovered in a decade. It has rust-coloured fur, a large, hairless gland on the underside of its tail and lacks dark skin pigment. Genetic analysis showed important differences between this specimen and close relatives. Sengis are restricted to Africa and despite their small size, are more closely related to elephants, manatees (known as sea cows) and aardvarks than they are to true shrews. The Etendeka round-eared sengi, or Macroscelides micus, was discovered by scientists from the California Academy of Sciences. It is the third new species of elephant shrew to be found in the wild in the past decade. The diminutive animal is smaller than other sengi and has rust-coloured fur, a large, hairless gland on the underside of its tail and lacks dark skin pigment, according to the study published in the Journal of Mammalogy. Its unusual appearance attracted the attention of experts Jack Dumbacher and Galen Rathbun, who noted it looked different from any museum specimens they had encountered. Elusive: The Etendeka round-eared sengi, or Macroscelides micus (pictured) was discovered by scientists from the California Academy of Sciences. It is the third new species of sengi to be found in the wild in the past decade . Mapped: Found in a remote area of Namibia, on the inland edge of the Namib Desert (mapped) at the base of the Etendeka Plateau, scientists believe this new species went undescribed for so long because of the challenges of doing scientific research in such an isolated area . Genetic analysis showed important differences between this specimen and close relatives. Together with experts from the National Museum of Namibia and the Republic of Namibia Ministry of Environment and Tourism, they scoured museums for similar animals and conducted more genetic tests, before confirming that they had found a new species. ‘The differences between this and all other known species are very subtle,’ said Dr Dumbacher. ‘Genetically, Macroscelides micus is very different from other members of the genus and it’s exciting to think that there are still areas of the world where even the mammal fauna is unknown and waiting to be explored.’ Elephant shrews are restricted to Africa and despite their small size, are more closely related to elephants, manatees (known as sea cows) and aardvarks than they are to true shrews.

Found in a remote area of Namibia, on the inland edge of the Namib Desert at the base of the Etendeka Plateau, scientists believe this new species went undescribed for so long because of the challenges of doing scientific research in such an isolated area. Yet it is precisely this isolation and the unique environmental conditions in the region that have given rise to this and other endemic animals. ‘With only about a dozen new species of mammal discovered in the wild each year, it is amazing that the Academy has been involved in describing three new sengis in the last decade,’ said Dr Rathbun Research Associate. ‘There are new and exciting insights into biodiversity awaiting discovery, even in a group as familiar as mammals.’","Scientists from the California Academy of Sciences discovered Macroscelides micus in the remote deserts of Namibia, south western Africa .

"The San Diego woman wounded in the terror attack on a shopping mall in Kenya lost two of her friends her father revealed as the first chilling pictures of the heavily armed Al Shabaab extremists who carried out the attack was unearthed today by Kenyan journalists. Pictured staggering away from Saturday's initial onslaught on Nairobi's Westgate mall covered in blood and gripping her iPhone, Elaine Dang, 26, has used social media and interviews with local Californian media to convey her relief and thanks to the Kenyan people. Despite her grief, Dang, who is an online restaurant guide manager in the Kenyan capital, said, 'I am recovering. Thank you for all the love and support—in Kenya and overseas. Terrorism knows no religion.' Scroll down for video . Rescued: Elaine Dang is helped out of the Westgate Shopping Centre where gunmen went on a shooting spree, in Nairobi on September 21, 2013. The gunmen stormed the shopping mall in Nairobi on Saturday . Speaking briefly to San Diego's CBS 8 from her hospital bed, Dang, who was spending the afternoon with co-workers at the mall when approximately 15 Al-Qaeda-affiliated gunmen opened fire, said that, 'I'm okay, I'm very grateful to be alive.' However, her father Steven said today that two of his daughter's friends perished in the hail of bullets unleashed on unsuspecting shoppers at the upmarket mall. Having required surgery on wounds to her chest, arms and legs following the terror outrage that has killed at least 62 people and injured over 170 more, including five Americans, Dang added that, 'I'm also very grateful or the Kenyan people, everyone was so helpful and supportive.' Dang works for Eat Out Kenya and a photograph that she posted to Twitter yesterday shows her in her hosptial room in Nairobi along with the message, 'Proof that I am Ok - hanging out with some of my best friends in Nairobi'. Using her Instagram account, Dang offered up heart-felt messages of thanks to her friends and family following her survival from the terror outrage, which according to Kenyan sources, could have been perpetrated by up to 15 terrorists, including three possible American citizens.

Hurt: Elaine Dang is taken away from the Westgate Mall (left) and posts a picture on social media of her wounds in the hours after . Chilling: This image shows two heavily armed gunmen prowling the Westgate mall in Nairobi and was tweeted by Mohammed Ali, Chief Investigations Editor at KTN . 'I am overwhelmed by all of the love and support from friends, family and professors!' wrote Dang. 'I will be OK, but please send your thoughts to so many injured, still held hostage. This incident has shown me people are amazing and in moments of true chaos - the impossible can happen.' Having seen her photographed as one of dozens of stunned and shocked survivors outside the mall following the shooting, Dang's father spoke to media outside his home to update them on his daughter's progress. Steven Dang told 10News he believes his daughter Elaine Dang suffered injuries to her chest, arm and leg. 'The chest … something metal came in her chest and then the arm and the leg,' he said. Restaurant Manager: Elaine Dang had moved to Nairobi in 2012 to work for Eat Out Kenya and is pictured here enjoying her life in the East African country . Life Changing: Elaine Dang surrounded by children in Africa - the restaurant manager was with friends in the Westgate mall before the attack . Dang, 26, graduated from Torrey Pines High School. According to a LinkedIn profile in her name, she went on to UC Berkeley and then taught underperforming kids through Teach for America. Asked what his emotions were when he first heard of his daughter being at the attack he said, 'I cried and then I'm afraid....Scary, but I'm happy right now...she do OK.' This comes as Mohammed Ali, Chief Investigations Editor at KTN, tweeted a picture of people that may be the attackers. It is CCTV footage of two men, carrying guns. They are not in army fatigues. If indeed it is the terrorists, it is one of the first images of the deadly attack and carries haunting echoes of the terror attack carried out in Mumbai in 2008, which left over 160 dead and injured more than 600 people. Steven Dang told 10News he believes his daughter Elaine Dang suffered injuries to her chest, arm and leg . Yearbook and Message to Media: Elaine Dang is pictured (left) in her yearbook picture and (right) a message left for the press on her family home in San Diego . Kenya’s Chief of Defence Forces, General Julius Karangi, said fighters from several countries had participated in the attack, but would not specify which ones. ‘We have an idea who they are, their nationality and even the number,’ he said, adding that the militants were ‘clearly a multinational collection from all over the world’. ‘We have also have an idea that this is not a local event,’ he said. ‘We are fighting global terrorism here and we have sufficient [intelligence] to suggest that.’ Smoke rises from the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi following a string of explosions during the third day of a stand-off between Kenyan security forces and gunmen inside the building .

At least three of the terrorists were killed, he added, after Kenyan forces moved into the five-story complex, which was filled with some 1,200 people when it was stormed by three heavily armed groups on Saturday. Kenyans were last night bracing themselves for further terror attacks after it was claimed dozens more militants from the organization had bribed their way into the country.

"A mother had her spine broken in four places, and was left with six cracked teeth and a hole in her retina after being attacked by her jealous ex-boyfriend because she went on a night out. Lindsey Pringle, 35, who suffers from osteoporosis meaning she has weak bones, had to spend 12 days in hospital after the savage beating by Curtis Storey, 21, in August last year. Miss Pringle told how she had broken up with Storey the day before the attack because of his controlling behaviour, but when he saw her in a Newcastle nightclub he ordered her to go home saying he would smash up her flat if she didn’t agree. Lindsey Pringle, 35 (left and right), was left with a hole in her retina, six broken teeth, and had her back fractured in four places after being attacked by her jealous ex-boyfriend Curtis Storey, 21 (left) Miss Pringle described how she broke up with Storey over his controlling behaviour, but when he saw her on a night out the day afterwards he ordered her to go home and then beat her unconscious . Once the pair were alone he attacked Miss Pringle, who stands only 5ft 2in and weighs just six stone, in her bathroom. He punched her twice in the face, knocking her unconscious, which caused her to fall backwards into her bath, hitting her back and causing four fractures. At the time of the assault Storey was already serving a community order for stabbing Miss Pringle in the neck with a key, a later hearing at Newcastle Crown Court was told. Storey, who has a previous conviction for harassing another partner, was jailed for two and a half years after the attack in August last year . Lindsey, who has an autistic son, Vincent, 13, said: 'I told him I didn't want to be with him. I parked my car around the corner so he didn't know if I was in or not. ‘Somebody told him we were in a bar and he said to me “get out or I will drag you out”. ‘He was shouting and screaming in my face saying “who said you could go out”. ‘I said, “I'm not with you, it's got nothing to do with you”. I went to the toilet so I could use my phone and he burst in and grabbed it off me. He looked at me and said “where is your car?” ‘When I told him it was at my friend's he smashed me in the side of the face so hard I could feel my eye swell. 'He smashed me in the side of the face and broke three teeth. He hit me again and broke another three teeth on the other side. I blacked out and I woke up on my back in the bath. 'He used to say ""I'll kill you"" all the time but I thought he was going to on that night. 'I was in so much pain but the adrenalin got me up. My face was killing me, my eye was black and he put a hole in my retina. 'I spat out bits of teeth in the sink. My back was in so much pain but we went down stairs together but he locked the front door. He was shouting he was going to kill me and I ran to the back door.' She found Storey had locked her in the house and she was forced to escape via the back door to a neighbour’s house, who called the police and took her to hospital. Lindsey added: ‘He knew I suffered from bad bones yet he still attacked me anyway. ‘He had put a hole in my retina when he punched me. The doctor said I was never going to get my sight back. I was devastated.’ Miss Pringle, a mother-of-one who suffers from osteoporosis meaning she has weak bones, had to spend weeks in hospital after the attack (left), and six months on still walks with a crutch (right) When Lindsey first met Storey through a friend she fell for his charm. But six weeks into their relationship he became jealous and possessive. Lindsey, who had previously been in a 16-year relationship, said: ‘When I first met him he was really nice. He was only the second man I had ever been with. Miss Pringle, whose son Vincent, 13, is autistic, only had one relationship before Storey, and says she may now never trust a man again . ‘But after about six weeks he started telling me what to do and what to wear. ‘I wasn't allowed to go to his mother's house without him being there and I wasn't allowed any boys as a friend on Facebook.’ Before long Storey started to snap for no reason and would cheat on Lindsey behind her back. She said: ‘He would accuse me of cheating on him and he would kick off for the slightest thing like if I didn't give him £10. He would snap and lock me in the house. ‘He would say “I am only doing it because you are so lovely and I don't want to lose you'."" He once dragged her from the house by her hair, smashed her car window, and during one row bit her on the face and nose. Storey even stabbed her in the neck with her car key when she tried to break up with him. Lindsey stayed with him because she was afraid he was going to smash up her house or her car. After the attack  Storey was arrested, and was yesterday jailed for two and a half years. Meanwhile, six months on from the attack, Miss Pringle still walks with a crutch, sees black shadows in one eye and is keeping her fingers crossed her back heals correctly. She added: 'I loved Curtis and I think he loved me too much but he showed it in the wrong way. 'I never wanted this to happen or for him to get jail but if I was looking at it from someone else's point of view, he should have got five or six years behind bars.' Lindsey, who also suffers from Crohn's disease, joint hypermobility syndrome and arthritis, added: 'I have permanent damage to my eye, I have nerve damage in my face and the tops of my gums. Miss Pringle said she started dating Storey after meeting him through a friend, but he soon became controlling, hitting her, smashing her car window, and once biting her on the face during a fight . 'My back is healing but because I have osteoporosis they don't know if my back will fully get better, I just hope it will. I'm still on strong painkillers and walk with one crutch.' Storey, of Walker, Newcastle, who admitted causing grievous bodily harm on August 24, was also made the subject of a lifelong restraining against Miss Pringle. The court also heard he has a previous conviction for harassment of another partner. Lindsey added: 'I don't know if I will ever have another boyfriend again. I want to live my life how I want and not have to explain to someone what I can and can't do.'","Lindsey Pringle, 35, began dating Curtis Storey, 21, through a friend .

"Most of us have stayed in the kind of hotel room we'd like to run a J cloth around before we touch anything. Whether its a film of grease over everything, hairs in the bath or even cockroaches - some hotel staff really need to get their pinnies out. And now, a new study from hotel booking website Hotel.info has dished the dirt on the world's cleanest - and more importantly its filthiest cities for an overnight stay. Six million customers were surveyed and the cities were scored out of ten, for their cleanliness. Scroll down for video . How clean is your hotel room? A new study from hotel booking website Hotel.info has dished the dirt on the world's cleanest - and more importantly its filthiest - cities for an overnight stay . Guests beware: Rio de Janeiro has been voted the city with the dirtiest hotels . The hoteliers in Tokyo come out very well in comparison with other large cities in an international survey. Guests in Warsaw could also eat their food from the floor. Brazil however scored an own goal: the World Cup was an excellent opportunity for the hotels in Brazil to improve their image. However the whole uproar about the World Cup seems to have left little time or energy for a 'clean-up'. In comparison with the previous football-free year the scores for cleanliness and hygiene were considerably lower in Rio (7.29) and in Sao Paulo (7.69). Runner up (but not one to boast about): London came in second place for dirtiest hotels . Sleep soundly: Tokyo was voted as the city with the cleanest hotel rooms worldwide . A glance at the online customer evaluations of European hotels can also help to prevent unpleasant surprises such as in Paris (7.63). In the UK, Sheffield came top with 8.15 points, while hoteliers in Liverpool (8.12) and Bristol (8.10) came in second and third place on the cleanliness scale. In Birmingham (7.42) the hotel guests were less satisfied. Even though the hotels there have somewhat improved in comparison with the previous year (7.38) the city is still at the bottom of the list. The capital city with only 7.52 points does not cover itself in glory: both in national and international comparisons there is room for improvement. 1. Tokyo, Japan: 8.93 . 2.

So what should you do if you find yourself in a grotty room? According to Ralf Priemer from Hotel.info: 'Should the room occupant actually find lipstick on the pillow or dirty mirrors in the bathroom and only risk using the shower with their shoes on, then the first step is to speak with the hotel staff or the local representative of their tour operator. The traveller should remain polite but firm and request that the shortcomings be corrected immediately or that they be permitted to move to another room. 'Most importantly the complaint should be made at once and to the relevant person. If the inadequacies cannot be corrected locally and the dispute cannot be resolved the complaint should be made in writing and accompanied with photographs.' 1. Birmingham 7.42 . 2. London 7.52 . 3.

"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency asked its employees in Denver this year to stop leaving a dangerous pollutant – human feces – in office hallways, according to a report that circulated on Wednesday. Managers in the EPA's Region 8 office in Denver, Colorado . emailed their entire staff to plead a cease-and-desist case for whoever had been pooping and fleeing. Government . Executive reported that EPA Deputy Regional Administrator Howard Cantor addressed 'several incidents' in the office building at 1595 Wynkoop Street in Denver. Employees, he wrote, had been clogging toilets with . paper towels. And there was 'an individual placing feces in the hallway' outside a restroom. Dirty job: Someone at the EPA had to pick up human feces that an employee left in the hallway of the agency's Denver office building . The EPA's Region 8 office at 1595 Wynkoop Street in downtown Denver, Colorado is near a popular pedestrian mall, but the EPA considers the unauthorized pooping to be an inside job . It's unclear whether EPA regulations leave room for the 'If you gotta go, you gotta go' rule, but the government green group shouldn't have problems cleaning up its mess. Last summer the agency awarded an $80,000 contract to TDA Research, Inc. 'to develop technologies to protect public health and the environment following potential accidents or intentional attacks involving chemical and biological agents.' The technology, the agency reported, 'involves applying an impermeable polymer material to create a barrier on contaminated wastes removed from response sites following chemical or biological incidents, including building materials, furniture, insulation, and other materials.' 'The successful encapsulation of chemicals and biological agents would protect responders and the general public from exposure and expedite the safe removal of wastes.' Region 8 serves Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming and 27 Tribal Nations, but only Denver seems to be afflicted with random pooping disease. Government Executive reported Eric Katz declined to share a copy of the EPA memo. 'Sorry ... can't share that,' he emailed MailOnline. 'Feel free to link to my story though. Thanks.' Katz reported that Cantor wrote: 'Management is taking this situation very . seriously and will take whatever actions are necessary to identify and . prosecute these individuals.', . The EPA official also asked employees to root out the poop bandit and turn him or her in. The Environmental Protection Agency funds hundreds thousands of studies each year into the harmful effects of volatile chemical compounds, so it should seem logical that Cantor consulted with John Nicoletti, a 'national expert' in workplace violence, to quantify the health risks. Feces left in areas where people walk is 'very dangerous' and a genuine health and safety risk, Nicoletti helpfully concluded, adding that whoever dropped the deuce would 'probably escalate' his or her behavior to something even more dastardly. No kidding: The EPA hired a workplace consultant to confirm that pooping anyplace other than here can be dangerous to human health . EPA spokesman Richard Mylott told Government Executive that its 'actions in response to recent workplace issues have been deliberate and have focused on ensuring a safe work environment for our employees.' The agency has been troubled in recent months with revelations of wrongdoing by its employees that pushed the bounds of believability. One employee whose work formed the cornerstone of the EPA's global-warming-control measures was jailed in December for defrauding the agency out of $900K by never showing up to work – claiming he was an undercover CIA agent . Another confessed to spending between two and six hours per day viewing pornography on his government-issued computer during work hours. Still others were found to be using government credit cards for gym memberships, gift cards, meals and even charity donations.","Stealth defecation irks EPA who circulates a memo asking workers to rat out the culprit .

"Nearly 100 lawmakers have now come out in favor of placing travel restrictions in order to decrease the odds that someone who is infected with Ebola will be able to enter the U.S. At least 80 members of the House and 20 senators have said they would like the president ban flights that have carrying passengers coming out of West Africa or temporarily rescind the visas of residents of Ebola stricken nations. President Barack Obama said on Thursday evening that he has no 'philosophical objection' to a travel ban, but he believes 'a flat-out travel ban is not the way to go.' The White House clarified on Friday that if the president believed such a move would be in the interest of the public's safety, 'he wouldn't hesitate to do that.' Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama said Thursday that he has no 'philosophical objection' to a travel ban, but that he thinks it's unnecessary . President Obama speaks to the media about the fight against the Ebola virus during a meeting with his Ebola Response Team in the Oval Office at the White House. Also pictured is Center for Disease Control Director Dr. Tom Frieden . The president's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said Friday that Obama's remarks last night after a meeting with health officials indicate that he is willing to 'keep an open mind' about how to address the Ebola crisis. He then noted: 'At this point, if our core priority is protecting the American public, then we're not going to put in place a travel ban.' Earnest later claimed that a moratorium on travel into the U.S. from Ebola hot spots 'will continue to be on the table' even though it's not something that is 'being considered right now.' The White House Press Secretary claimed that the screening measures at airports are working and the government has had a '100 percent success rate' of preventing people who are showing symptoms of Ebola from getting into the U.S. That, Earnest, said, is the purpose of the screenings, and by that standard the current policies and procedures have been a great success.

'If it is assessed that there might be other aspects of our travel policies that would strengthen the health and security of the American public, then the president won't just consider them, he'll implement them,' he later explained. 'If he concluded that an all out travel ban actually would be in the best interest of protecting the health and safety of the American public, if circumstances change on the ground in a way that an all out travel ban needed to be implemented, the president wouldn't hesitate to do that.' The White House's indication that the president could impose a travel ban in the future comes as a cavalcade of lawmakers, mostly Republican, but also some Democrats, have demanded that Obama reconsider his position on the issue. Republican members of the Texas delegation joined the fray on Thursday, sending a letter to Obama that urged him to use his authority to block individuals from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea from coming to the U.S. Also on Thursday, Republican Rep. Dennis Ross of Florida announced that when Congress resumes its legislative session after the midterm elections, he will introduce legislation demanding Obama put a ban into effect. 'Now that two of our healthcare workers have contracted the virus I am putting my foot down,' Ross said. 'This legislation is a more serious approach to preventing Ebola from further infiltrating our homeland.' Even former White House flak Jay Carney said on Thursday that the president and his administration ought to take it under review. 'I think substantive actions need to be taken, and they may involve flight restrictions, they may involve moving all patients to specific hospitals in the country that can handle Ebola, and I think those would be wise decisions to make,' Carney, now a CNN contributor, said on the network yesterday. Carney admitted that he's not 'an expert' on the issue but said a more aggressive approach 'would demonstrate a level of seriousness in response to this that is merited at this point.' Earnest responded in depth to proponents of travel restrictions in his daily briefing on Thursday. ‘If we were to put in place a travel ban or a visa ban, it would provide a direct incentive for individuals seeking to travel to the United States to go underground and to seek to evade this screening and to not be candid about their travel history in order to enter the country,' he claimed. 'And that means it would be much harder for us keep tabs on these individuals and make sure that they get the screening that's needed to protect them and to protect more importantly the American public,’ he added. Earnest also said that allowing commercial travel to West Africa is critical' to making sure supplies, equipment and personnel are able to enter the region. As a 'practical matter' a travel ban would make it 'harder for the international community to respond to this incident,' he said, because airline companies don't make flights into Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea if they can't take any cargo back. The White House spokesman confirmed that President Obama made calls to members of Congress on Thursday to talk about the Ebola crisis, including House Speaker John Boehner, who has endorsed the travel ban. He would not say whether Obama and any of the members discussed a travel ban, though. Rep. Tim Murphy, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, endorsed a travel ban at a rare recess hearing on Capitol Hill yesterday. Murphy charged that 'screening and self-reporting at airports have been a demonstrated failure' White House spokesman Josh Earnest was blitzed with questions about the Obama administration's handling of the Ebola crisis for the second day in a row on Friday. The Obama administration official said again today that the president would not put restrictions on commercial travel from West Africa to the U.S., however he left the possibility open for a future travel ban . At a  congressional hearing on the Ebola crisis in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, members ginned up their support for travel restrictions. At the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing.Ohio Rep. Tim Murphy alleged that 'screening and self-reporting at airports have been a demonstrated failure.' Murphy, who chair's the committee, estimated that approximately 1,000 people from Ebola afflicted countries are arriving in the U.S. on a weekly basis, which presents a great threat. At the hearing CDC Director Thomas Frieden declined to say whether his agency had talked about a travel ban with the White House. However, he too, suggested that he would be open to the idea. The CDC does not have the authority to restrict flights or visas, however, explained. 'At CDC, our authority is to quarantine individuals or require the isolation of individuals.' Congressman Fred Upton of Michigan said he didn't but the White House's claims that travel restrictions would make it too hard to send equipment and personnel to West Africa. 'Surely we can find other ways to get the aid workers and supplies in to these countries,' he said. 'From terrorist watch lists to quarantines, there are tools used to manage air travel to assure public safety. Why not here? Upton argued that the Obama administration needs to rethink it's approach to fighting Ebola 'to stop the spread of this disease here at home and at its source in Africa.' 'This includes travel restrictions from that region beginning today.' The White House announced on Friday morning that Ron Klain, a former chief of staff to two vice presidents, had been tapped to lead the administration's response to the Ebola crisis. Earnest said this afternoon that he did not know when Klain would start and that he had only just accepted the job when his appointment was announced to the press.","That number includes members who want an outright travel ban and those who want the U.S. to temporarily rescind West Africans' visas .

"A devoted Chinese father who carries his disabled son 18 miles to school every day will be provided with government-funded accommodation nearby. Yu Xukang walks the huge distance with his son, Xiao Qiang, strapped to his back in a specially constructed basket. The 40-year-old, from Fengyi township in Yibin county in southwest China’s Sichuan province - 2,000 miles west of Shanghai - refused to give up on the boy now aged 12, despite the fact that both his arms and legs are twisted and his back is hunched. Devoted: Chinese father Yu Xukang carries his son to school every day - a round-trip of 18 miles . Dedication: Mr Xukang said that he refused to give up on his son after he couldn't find a school near where they lived that would accept him . He said: ‘I know that my son is physically disabled but there is nothing wrong with his mind. However, I couldn't find any school here with the facilities to accept him and was constantly rejected. In fact the only place where I could get a place for him was at the Fengxi Primary School in Fengyi township in Yibin county in Sichuan province - which is a five-mile walk away.’ The father was separated from the boy's mother nine years ago when Xiao was three years old, and decided to raise him alone. He said he was determined that the boy would not suffer from being raised by a single parent and he wanted to give him the best opportunity. Spotlight: After Mr Xukang's Herculean efforts were revealed in local media, the local government stepped in and offered him accommodation near the school . Because there was no school bus and no suitable public transport the father decided that the only alternative was to make sure he carried him every day to school and back. He said: ‘I have carried him there and back now since last September, every morning I get up at 5am to prepare a lunch for him to eat and then I walk the four-and-a-half miles to the school, and then come back here so I can work to earn money. I then walk back to the school to pick up my son and bring him home.’ Write stuff: Disabled Xiao is top of his class . He said that he estimates he has walked around 1,600 miles up and down hills backwards and forwards since he started counting: ‘My son with his disabilities is not in a position to walk on his own and it also means that he can't ride a bike. Despite being 12 he's just 90 cm tall. But I am proud of the fact that he is already top of his class and I know he will achieve great things. My dream is that he will go to college.’ After the distance that Mr Xukang walks was revealed in local media the local government announced that they would rent a room to the dad in the near future. And in the meantime the school will be adapted so that it can also take boarding students, including Xiao, to help reduce the workload of the father.","A dad from China's Yibin county takes his son to a school 4.5 miles away .

"Bostonians whose smart phones are in need of a little juice must look no further than their closest public park. The city and its partners at MIT announced Friday the debut of Soofa, the solar-powered bench with a USB port to charge your cell phone in green spaces across Beantown. After all, reasons Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh, 'your cell phone doesn’t just make phone calls, why should our benches just be seats?' Soofa: Two park goers chat on one of Boston's new solar-powered, cell-phone charging park benches. The Soofas debuted in green spaces across the city starting June 27 . According to a city press release, the benches will debut over the course of a week in locations that include Titus Sparrow Park in the South End, the Boston Common, and the Rose Kennedy Greenway. The benches are the second such smart seats in the city. A previous partnership between the MIT Media Lab, its spin-off firm Changing Environments and the city itself was a similar but smaller device called Seat-e. 'We’re delighted to continue the Greenway's partnership with New Urban Mechanics and the MIT Media Lab,' said Jesse Brackenbury, Executive Director of the Rose Kennedy Greenway Conservancy. 'The Soofa will allow visitors and their phones to enjoy the sun on the Greenway.' The forward-thinking benches feature two USB ports and a solar panel. Users will have to provide their own charging cords. Residents are encouraged to go online and recommend a location at bit.ly/bosbench  or tweet the location to @newurbanmechs by July 11. In addition, the designers at Changing Environments are asking Bostonians to submit ideas for names of the Soofas in each park by July 11 through Twitter to @mysoofa or via the website, soofa.co. The winners will be invited to visit designers at the MIT Media Lab and see where it all started.","The so-called Soofa debuts in green spaces across Beantown this week .

Obama shook hands and embraced the 20-year-old Yale student who has caused a buzz with his tall, dashing good looks and likeness to his uncle, the late John F. Kennedy Jr., who died in a plane crash in 1999. There has been increasing interest in Mr Shlossberg, who is training to be an EMT, as he appears to be taking on the Kennedy legacy, making more public appearances and speaking engagements. In his speech, Obama said JFK stays in America's imagination not because he was assassinated, but because he embodied the character of the people he led. He said Kennedy was defiant in the face of impossible odds and determined to make the world anew. 'In his idealism - sober, squared jawed idealism - we are reminded that the power to change this country is ours,' Obama said. 'It is a legacy continued by his brothers and sisters who gave us a more gentle and compassionate country.'

Earlier on Wednesday, President Obama and former President Bill Clinton silently honored fellow Democrat John F. Kennedy at the slain leader's grave, marking the 50th anniversary of his assassination. Obama and Clinton, along with First Lady Michelle Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, laid a large blue and white wreath on the sun-dappled grave of JFK, who was gunned down in Dallas on November 22, 1963. They then stood together, with hands on hearts, as a bugler played the US military lament 'Taps' before observing a moment of silence. Present, past, and future: Presidents Obama and Clinton were accompanied by their wives at the Kennedy gravesite, and Hillary Clinton is thought to be the party's presidential frontrunner . Big day: The memorial ceremony was held just over an hour after President Obama awarded President Clinton the Medal of Freedom- an honor first established by President Kennedy in 1963 . Support: Michelle and Barack Obama laid the wreath at the eternal flame that was established at President John F. Kennedy's grave in Arlington National Cemetery . Extended members of the Kennedy clan looked on at the tableau of presidential power, past, present, and possibly future. The observance came more than an hour after Obama awarded Bill Clinton- and 15 other luminaries- with the highest US civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which was first minted by Kennedy. Later today, Obama will pay tribute to Kennedy's legacy at a speech at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington honoring medal awardees.

The poignant moment of remembrance came two days before the official half century anniversary of the death of Kennedy, who was gunned down in an open top limousine in Dallas, Texas, in a crime which traumatized the world. The ceremonies have sparked a prolonged period of national and media reflection on the unfinished legacy of Kennedy, his tragedy-crossed family and of the evocative period in the early 1960s when his political star illuminated the world. Kennedy's closest living relative, his daughter Caroline however, was not at Wednesday's ceremony. An early supporter of Obama's presidential ambitions, she has just set off on a new chapter of her life as the US ambassador to Tokyo. Kennedy connection: Bill Clinton has often cited his meeting with President Kennedy in 1963 as one of the moments when he decided he wanted to become a politician . Wave of approval: Caroline Kennedy's endorsement of Obama over Hillary Clinton in 2008 was deemed a turning point in the highly contentious Democratic primary contest that year . He was busy: Former President Bush made an appearance on Jay Leno's talk show in Los Angeles Tuesday night and did not attend the wreath-laying ceremony. Former Presidents George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter were also missing . The joint Obama-Clinton appearance at . the grave site represented the latest show of unity between two . political power families who waged a bitter 2008 Democratic presidential . nominating duel. Hillary . Clinton is now the favorite to land the Democratic nomination for the . 2016 election -- but has not said whether she will make another run for . the White House. Presidents . Clinton and Obama, both of whom were elected to second terms, laid claim . to the legacy of John F. Kennedy in their own White House runs. Next generation: President Obama held a newborn Kennedy under the watchful eye of the child's mother Maeve Kennedy McKeon, whose mother Kathleen was one of Bobby Kennedy's 13 children . Relaxed moment: The ceremony was serious at the beginning but the attendees spent time chatting after the wreath was laid . Clinton . was famously pictured meeting Kennedy at an event in the White House . Rose Garden in July 1963, and has reminisced about how he set eyes on . the presidency himself after shaking JFK's hand. Obama, who was two years old when the . 35th US president was killed, accepted Kennedy's torch of Democratic . Party idealism in a key moment of the 2008 campaign -- which irked the . Clintons -- from president Kennedy's late brother, Senator Edward . Kennedy, at American University in Washington. The . two presidents stood together at a painful political moment for Obama . after being brought low by the botched implementation of his signature . health care law. In the . Medal of Freedom ceremony, Obama said that Clinton's presidency proved . that it was possible to grow the economy, cut the deficit and invest in . science, technology and education -- remarks which mirrored his own core . political argument to American voters. Kennedy's killing was blamed on a gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald, who the government concluded to be acting alone. But . the 50 years since have been replete with conspiracy theories centering . on whether Oswald was the true culprit and if he was acting on his own . initiative or was part of a wider plot. Paying respects: Though President Kennedy's family initially wanted him to be buried by the family plot in Massachusetts, Jackie insisted he be buried in Washington . Tributes: This week has been filled with ceremonies in honor of the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's death on November 22, 1963 .

"Evicted: Nathan Grindal was told to leave the televised final after rowdy fans started chanting 'Jesus' at him, sparking fears the players' concentration would be disrupted . A darts fan was kicked out of a live televised final after the 4,500-strong crowd interrupted play by taunting him - because he looks like Jesus. Bearded Nathan Grindal was enjoying the clash between Phil Taylor and Kim Huybrechts when some of the audience spotted his likeness to the son of God. Chants of 'Jesus' quickly spread through the rowdy crowd packed into Butlins' at Minehead, Somerset. Security staff were called amid fears that Nathan's omnipresence was upsetting the concentration of ex-world champ Taylor and his Belgian rival. The labourer, of Abingdon, Oxfordshire, was close to tears as six bouncers removed him from the Cash Converters Players' Championship which was being shown on ITV4. As he left a chant of 'Stand up if you love Jesus' broke out with many of the boozed-up crowd getting to their feet. Nathan, 33, was escorted to a nearby bar where the security staff bought him a pint and told him to watch the rest of the final on the telly. He saw the legendary Taylor win - and then found himself being asked to pose for signed photos with fans as they left the arena. Blond-haired Nathan, who emigrated from his native Australia to Oxford six years ago, said: 'I didn't go to the darts dressed as Jesus - I went as me. 'It was all very weird and distressing. I didn't break down crying but I did get emotionally distraught. 'They were bullying me and picking on me, saying that I was someone else. 'It would have been okay if the security hadn't made a fuss getting me out of the arena. 'I was evicted for something I have no control over. I felt discriminated against.' Scroll down for video . Rowdy: The crowd chants 'Stand up if you love Jesus' as Nathan is escorted out of the venue . Thrown out: Bouncers take the darts fan away while the crowd's chants increase in intensity . Lookalike: Fans continue to Nathan for looking like Jesus as he leaves the match he had been trying to enjoy . Have one on us: Nathan was escorted to a nearby bar by security staff, who bought him a pint and told him to watch the rest of the match on television last year . Nathan, who began growing his beard four . months ago, had booked a three-day stay at Butlins earlier this month . with five pals to watch the darts. He added: 'After the tournament ended, I must admit a lot of people went to get autographs and signed photos from me. 'I signed a few pieces of paper - but in my real name, not Jesus. Distressing: Nathan, pictured right, said he became 'emotionally distraught' as he was escorted out of the final, featuring Phil 'The Power' Taylor, left . 'In his post-match interview, Phil Taylor said something like ""if I ever see Jesus again, I'll crucify him myself"". Now that's just hurtful. 'I love darts, but I'm worried about ever going to see it live again, just in case the crowd turns on me like they did last time.' Dave Allen, spokesman for the Professional Darts Corporation, said Nathan was ejected to prevent his presence becoming a nuisance to the players. Unlucky mate: Darts player Kim Huybrechts gave Nathan this signed programme for his troubles following his eviction . Runner-up: Huybrechts at the Minehead Butlins where he lost the final to Taylor . He said: 'There was a lot of chanting of Jesus and I think to avoid it becoming too much of a distraction for the players he was taken by security to another part of the complex. 'We want everyone who comes to have a good time and we do not want one fan to become a problem for the players and to possibly affect play.' He added: 'There is plenty of audience participation. They are encouraged to support the players within certain boundaries. 'The fact they can buy four-pint pitchers certainly helps.'

"Donor: Jemima Layzell's organs were donated after she died from a brain haemorrhage aged just 13 . A 13-year-old schoolgirl who died from a brain haemorrhage saved the lives of eight people by opting to donate her organs. Jemima Layzell had discussed organ donation with her parents and told them she wanted her body to help save others in the event of her death. And when the healthy teenager suddenly collapsed at home in Horton, Somerset, and died in hospital from a massive bleed in her brain, her parents decided to honour her wish. Since her death her heart has gone to a five-year-old boy, a 14-year-old was given her lungs and her liver was split between two boys, aged ten months and five. Two people, aged 19 and 24, received her kidneys, a 40-year-old man was given her pancreas and her small bowel has changed the life of a boy aged three-and-a-half. Jemima - who aspired to become an author - also donated eye tissue which will help restore the sight of two people. Her proud parents, photographer Harvey, 43, and mum Sophy, 38, today paid tribute to their daughter, who passed away on March 14. They said: 'Jemima was lovely - clever, funny, compassionate and creative. 'She was a brilliant artist but planned to be an author and left many poems, songs, stories and also serious thoughts about her life and the world's problems and delights. 'She also thought about and discussed death and said of her wish to be an organ donor when she died. Life saver: Her donated organs have saved the lives of eight people and will help a further two regain their sight . Jemima, 13, was a fit and active teenager when she collapsed at her family home in Horton, Somerset . 'Eight people have benefited from vital parts of her beautiful young healthy body, including five young children. 'Jemima was much loved, was fiercely loyal and cherished her many friends and sister Amelia. 'She has left a lasting legacy and example to others, by being an organ donor. 'It is so sad and we all miss her terribly and it seems such a waste of wonderful potential, but Jemima's short life was so full of joy and achievement and finally such generosity - to be celebrated and always remembered.' Jemima collapsed at home 'without warning' during early evening preparations for her mum Sophy's 38th birthday party on March 10. She had extreme pain in her head and lost consciousness. The teenager had suffered a massive bleed caused by a ruptured giant aneurysm deep in the left side of her brain. Sister act: Jemima Layzell, right, with her little sister Amelia who she 'cherished' Jemima had a close group of friends at Taunton School and enjoyed reading and writing in her diary . Her horrified family called 999 and Jemima was rushed to Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton, Somerset, and later transferred to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol. She passed away at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children at 4.28pm on March 14 as she could not recover from the effects of the major haemorrhage. Her parents said 'beloved and courageous' Jemima, a pupil of £15,000-per-year Taunton School, had 'spurred' her mother into co-founding MAdD performing arts school. She regularly modelled for her father's photography studios, Gorilla Photographic Studios. They added: 'We are so glad to have so many wonderful pictures of Jemima, feeling beautiful and being creative. 'She was quite serious but also enjoyed silly games, consequences, paper games, treasure hunts and tree climbing. 'She usually carted around a large bag with school essentials, her private diary and several books. 'On the day she died the books were Milton's 'Paradise Lost' and 'The Right to Write'.' Jemima, who has a sister Amelia, kept a detailed diary which her parents now hope to get published. A memorial will be held for her at Taunton School Chapel on May 21 at 4pm.

"Seven years before he allegedly plotted to behead a member of the public in Sydney's Martin Place, Omarjan Azari was fanatical about soccer. The 22-year-old, whose parents left for Saudi Arabia the day before he was arrested and are not yet unaware of their son's arrest, was so good at soccer he was selected for a representative side in Sydney. But Omarjan, who was a student at Parramatta High School, didn't take it up. Omarjan was arrested on Thursday in the nation's largest counter-terrorism operation as hundreds of police raided homes in Sydney and Brisbane. Scroll down for video . Omarjan Azari (pictured) has been charged with a serious terrorism related offence and allegedly plotted to behead a member of the public in Martin Place . 'Afghanis are traditionally more interested in study than sport,' the accused's cousin Rami Azari told Daily Mail Australia. 'There was another Greek kid who wasn't as good but Omarjan knew he wanted it desperately and so Omarjan gave up his place. 'He was always interested in justice and fighting against injustice. 'Maybe [that's what got him into trouble].' Omarjan appeared in court on Thursday charged with a conspiracy to prepare a terrorist attack on Australian soil. He is the second man charged so far after police arrested 15 people in the raids. According to court documents, police intercepted a phone call three days ago between Omarjan Azari and Mohammad Ali Baryalei, who is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East. The account said Baryalei ordered him to carry out an attack, which Sydney Central Local Court heard was 'clearly designed to shock, horror and terrify the community'. 'I don't believe that he made the phone call [making the beheading threat],' Omarjan's cousin said. 'He'd stopped using his phone because he was being followed by police and ASIO.' Omarjan's uncle, University of Western Sydney lecturer in Afghani studies, Dr Ehsan Azari, said his nephew was 'very pious'. 'But if he is truly involved in this it is someone else who has convinced him, turned his mind,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'He was not a scholar, or very good at school.' Dr Azari is a respected Sydney academic, specialising in English literature, and a media commentator on politics in the Afghani and Pakistani region. He has an MA in English literature and linguistics, and a PhD in critical and cultural studies. He regrets what has happened in his homeland since he emigrated to Australia 20 years ago. 'We came from war and now there is all this talk of war,' he said. Dr Azari has written books on literature, drama and poetry, in particular Shakespeare, and a book on Sufism, the mystical Islamic faith. He said it was sad Afghani people, who had long historical ties with Australia, might be regarded as suspicious by some Australians. Dr Azari said Omarjan's parents haven't been told of their son's arrest. 'We cannot tell his father because he is very sick and might die,' he said. Omarjan's father, Alim Azari, who is a severe diabetic, and his wife flew out from Sydney airport on Wednesday for the Middle East to celebrate the Hajj festival. The couple were planning to spend 20 days in Saudi Arabia. The Azaris, who are believed to have four children, had moved just three weeks ago from Guildford to the rented house in South Wentworthville - both in Sydney's west - where Omarjan was arrested in Thursday's raids. His sister and a man are still living in the house. It's a quiet suburban street where devout Muslim and mechanic apprentice Omarjan plotted allegedly to commit a public beheading just days after his parents were out of the country, and which narrowly missed being the epicentre of Thursday's terrorism raids. Only one neighbour noticed a sign of the intense police surveillance on the brick duplex where Azari allegedly spent three months conspiring the terrorist attack, before his family was forced to move to the house in Guildford where he was arrested. A local business owner noticed the police vehicle always on the corner around from the Azari's home until it disappeared four weeks ago. Omarjan lived with his father Alam, mother Gulpekai, brother, Fahim and sister, Mursal in number 4A, the front half of a brick duplex in a dilapidated cul de sac in Sydney's west. A New Zealand family lived behind them in 4B. The house is just over two kilometres from the western Sydney business district of Parramatta and about an hour's drive from Martin Place, where police allege Omarjan Azari was going to behead a random member of the public after his parents had flown out to Saudi Arabia. It seems the Azaris were the only Muslims in the street where Sri Lankan and Indian families live in houses below the western rail line. The Azari's house, which has marble tiled floors and a garden flourishing with lavender, is one of the better looking homes in the street. But the family was given notice to move out by early September, because the house and the one next door are due to be demolished to make way for a block of flats. Omarjan's uncle Ehsan Azari said the forced move to Guildford had caused some anxiety for his sister and brother-in-law, coming so soon before they were due to leave on their three-week holiday for the Hajj religious festival in Saudi Arabia. Neighbours of the Azari's told Daily Mail Australia the family had been quiet, kept to themselves except to say hello and that on weekends Omarjan used to roam around the street and play cricket with young men who looked to be in their late teens. But since the second week of May, Omarjan Azari and the street had been under police surveillance, which had to switch six kilometres away to Bursill St, Guildford when the family moved. An armed police officer escorted Azari from court into a waiting prison van . At least 800 officers from AFP and NSW Police were involved in anti-terror raids on Thursday . Rami Azari said his cousin was a 'gentle loving person' and the allegations didn't make sense. Omarjan had worked as a sales assistant, done some accountancy which he didn't like, then done a mechanical apprenticeship at TAFE and had recently gained a full apprenticeship as a car mechanic. Rami said his cousin 'didn't have time' to be involved in any terror plots because 'he studies at night'. Dr Ehsan Azari is a lecturer in Afghani studies at University of Western Sydney . He said Omarjan - who police are believed to have kept under surveillance since May this year - had been aware he was being followed. 'He's only a kid. He was petrified. He's been scared for a long time,' Rami said. 'He's been scared for a long time because he was being followed.' Rami said when they talked, Omarjan would insist they put their mobile phones in the car, so they could ensure no one was listening. For that reason, he could not believe police had any evidence of a phone call. Rami said after his cousin gave up his spot in the soccer team for the other player, the Greek Australian had gone on to play professional soccer over in Greece. Both Rami and his father said although Omarjan was very religious he was 'too young' to have done what he was accused of. The Azaris said although police said Omarjan was 22-years-old, he was actually only 20. About 12 homes were searched in Sydney's northwest suburbs by NSW Police and Australian Federal Police on Thursday. Police executed search warrants in Beecroft, Bellavista, Guildford, Merrylands, Northmead, Wentworthville, Marsfield, Westmead, Castle Hill, Revesby, Bass Hill and Regents Park.

"An American NGO worker has described the terrifying moment he dashed across Nairobi's Westgate Mall carrying his two-year-old daughter and hid in a storage room after hearing explosions and gunshots. Pennsylvania-born Nick Handler, who is a field director for a farming non-profit, was sitting at a cafe in the mall with his daughter, Julia, when the deadly siege began on Saturday.

'All of a sudden I just heard a loud . explosion followed by a few gun shots and I just immediately just . grabbed (Julia) and luckily it was right by the door and we were able to . sprint out of the cafe and ran across the mall,' Handler told ABC News by phone on Monday. The father and daughter initially followed other frightened mallgoers out a service exit towards the back of the mall before a wave of people came rushing back inside, apparently 'running away from some shooting out the front,' Handler said. Hugging Julia tight, Handler went back inside the mall and ended up hiding in an inventory room with about 40 other people while al Qaeda-linked gunmen massacred innocent mallgoers outside. He said at one point it seemed the terrorists may have discovered their hiding spot as a group of people who had left the storage room suddenly started rushing back in, screaming. 'Aside from that initial explosion, this was probably the most terrifying moment,' Handler told ABC, 'not knowing if perhaps the people who had left had encountered some of the attackers who were then coming into the area that we were hiding.'

"Apple's head of design has hit out at the firm's competition, accusing them of 'stealing' its designs. Sir Jonathan Ive told the audience at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit in San Francisco his feelings on the matter were 'a bit harsh'. 'I don't see it as flattery,' he said, 'I actually see it as theft.' Scroll down for video . Sir Jonathan also revealed this - the first phone he ever designed. Thankfully, his vision was refined for the iPhone. Sir Jonathan  said seeing knockoff designs made him think of the lengthy development cycle that went into producing the originals. 'When you're doing something for the first time, for example with the phone, and you don't know it's going to work, and you spend seven or eight years working on something, and then it's copied — I have to be honest, the first thing I think isn't 'ooh, that was flattering. 'All those weekends I could have had at home with my lovely family but didn't, but the flattery made up for it.' The designer was asked about Xiaomi, a Chinese firm which has been accused of copying Apple's style. Not an iPhone: the Xiaomi Miui 6 handset, which many have said is simply a copy of the iPhone . The firm's latest software and handset looks extremely similar to Apple's iOS 8 software. The designer also gave a rare insight into how his team works, revealing there are just 16 or 17 people. 'It's grown steadily over the last 15 years,' he said. 'We've worked hard to keep it small. Sir Jonathan Ive spoke with Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter in a rare interview . 'One of the advantages of being part of a design team that's been around for a long time is we've had the luxury to develop our process. 'We meet three or four times a week. 'The designers gather around the same kind of tablets you see in Apple Stores. 'We stand around those tables...and we draw. It really galvanizes and focuses our team.' He also spoke about the team's work on Apple Watch. 'Steve was the most focused person I've met in my life. 'It's terrifying that when you really truly focus, it seems a bit illegal. 'You can achieve so much. 'What focus means is saying no with every bone in your body to something you know is a good idea but you say no because you're focused on something else. I remember talking to Steve Jobs and asked why he was perceived as harsh. 'And I said couldn't we be more moderate? And he said why? And I said because I care about the team. 'And he said: 'No Jony, you're just really vain. You just want people to like you. I'm surprised at you, because I thought you really held the work up as the most important and not how you are perceived by people.''

"A Mexican man once listed as the world's heaviest human has been cremated after dying on Monday at the age of 48. The body of Manuel Uribe was brought to the Serorrey funeral home aboard a flat-bed truck, on the same special bed where he spent much of the last decade. Funeral home director Pedro Reyes said Serorrey's cremation facility was the only one in the northern city of Monterrey able to handle Uribe's body. Reyes said Tuesday the oven temperature was set about 60 percent higher than normal.

Body: Members of the Civil Protection secure a king size bed, refitted with a metal frame and a plastic tarp, holding the body of the late Manuel Uribe on its way to the crematorium of a local funeral parlour in Monterrey Monday . Mortuary workers and Civilian Protection members unload a box with the corpse of Mexican Manuel Uribe, 48, who was recognized as the heaviest man in the world by  Guinness Book of Records in 2007, in Monterrey on May 26, 2014 . A religious service was held Tuesday for Uribe. Plans for the ashes weren't clear. Uribe had slimmed down to about 867 pounds (394 kilograms), after his peak weight of 1,230 pounds (560 kilograms) was certified in 2006 as a Guinness World Record. He had been confined to his bed in Monterrey for years, unable to walk on his own. Uribe had . been taken to the hospital on May 2 because of an abnormal heartbeat. He had to be taken to the hospital with a crane by emergency and civil defense workers. Doctors . have not yet certified the cause of death. In addition to the cardiac . condition, Uribe was also believed to have suffered from liver problems. Uribe married Claudia Solis in 2008, and the wedding was one of the few times he left his home in recent years. Foodlover: Manuel Uribe is pictured eating in his bed at home in Monterrey in 2006 .

After years of diet, exercise and medical care, Uribe, had lost more than 550 pounds by the ceremony. He . had hoped to walk down the aisle, but despite his dramatic weight loss, . he was transported to the ceremony on a flatbed truck and remained in . his custom-made bed, according to The Associated Press. Uribe shed tears during the ceremony and embraced his then-38-year-old bride for a 'first dance' but didn't indulge in wedding cake. 'He didn't break his diet,' Uribe's mother said. 'I have a wife and will form a new family and live a happy life,' Uribe told reporters before the ceremony for 400 guests.

'She asked me for a divorce,' he said. 'I was very depressed.' Uribe . was a chubby kid, weighing more than 250 pounds as an . adolescent. Starting in 1992, he said, his weight began ballooning . further. In 2007, Uribe told ABC News: 'I had an obesity problem for many years, a very significant one. I was gaining and gaining weight. I was on every diet you can imagine.' 'I used to eat normal, just like all Mexicans do... beans, rice, flour tortilla, corn tortilla, French fries, hamburgers, subs and pizzas, whatever regular people eat.

"A formerly obese man has told how he managed to lose more than half his body weight after being reunited with his high school sweetheart; his now-wife. Lee Jordan, 50, revealed to CNN that he was a slender 165lbs as a teenager but during his 20s his 5ft 8in frame ballooned to 453lbs due to a gut-busting 8,000 to 12,000-calorie-per-day diet. It was only when he reconnected with his long lost love, Beth Schwein, that he realized he had to turn this life around. Thanks to her encouragement, he lost 275lbs and today the married couple run a fitness company together out of Jacksonville Beach, Florida. New mad: Lee Jordan, 50, has told how he managed to lose more than half his body weight after being reunited with his high school, sweetheart; his now-wife . ‘Beth looked at me, and all she saw was Lee Jordan,’ Lee said, recalling his first encounter with Beth in more than 20 years one day in 2008. ‘That’s it. There was nothing but love and acceptance in her eyes. 'I cannot express how powerful that was. That was the turning point that gave me the willingness to turn things around.’ Before his transformation, Lee had full-blown diabetes, lung disease, sleep apnea, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. He also spent two-and-a-half years hooked up to an oxygen supply using a machine at home and a canister while he was at work. Transformation: During his 20s Lee's 5ft 8in frame ballooned to 453lbs (left) due to a gut-busting 8,000 to 12,000-calorie-per-day diet - today he weighs a lighter 178lbs (right) loves exercising . High school sweethearts-turned-spouses: Lee and Beth originally met in 1979 through a church youth group in the Washington area - they broke up but met for the first time in 2008 . Doctors estimated that he had just two years to live. But with Beth by his side, he lost the weight needed for gastric bypass surgery and gave his diet an overhaul. The two originally met in 1979 through a church youth group in the Washington area and started dating. 'I never ate less than two large pizzas, followed by the super-size large family bag of Doritos, two large tubs of dip, two large boxes of cookies and a half-gallon of ice cream' After graduation, Beth went to Radford . University in Virginia and Lee followed her a year later. They had . planned on getting married after finishing school but things didn’t work . out. While Lee got distracted by the party scene, Beth was more career-focused and eventually the two drifted apart. Lee dropped out of school, moved home and got a job as an assistant manager at a clothing store. Because it was too painful, he and Beth made a pact not to speak again. Over the years Lee piled on the pounds due to a lack of exercise and poor diet. He estimates that he consumed 8,000 to 12,000 calories a day. 'I never ate less than two large pizzas, followed by the super-size large family bag of Doritos, two large tubs of dip, two large boxes of cookies and a half-gallon of ice cream . . . I buried my emotions in food,' he said. Fitness fanatics: The couple married in 2012 and now enjoy doing 10Ks, half-marathons and triathlons together . All smiles: Lee says reconnecting with Beth helped him to conquer his obesity problem . He never married, barely dated and still . held a flame for Beth, often sifting through a box of old memories from . their time together. Meanwhile she had gone on to build a career for herself, get married and have a family. But she still felt unfulfilled and in 2004, an aunt’s dying wish prompted her to send a letter to Lee out of the blue. In the note she filled him in on her life and talked about how their love had been true and apologized for any hurt feelings. 'Love, acceptance and encouragement were the difference-makers for me... If you do a little at a time, you can gain so much' Several years earlier she had . suffered a broken back in a rollerblading accident and instead of . surgery, she taught herself to walk again by working with a personal . trainer and doing strength exercises. Feeling better than ever before, she decided to get certified as a fitness expert herself. It wasn’t until 2008 that she finally met up with Lee. When she saw him she decided to help him battle his obesity problem with the knowledge she had gained. As his health improved, the two rekindled their old passion. ‘All the years were washed away,’ Lee said. ’I was alive again.’ After Beth got a divorce, Lee proposed in 2012 at the same spot in Starbucks where they had first met for coffee four years earlier. I do: After Beth got a divorce, Lee proposed in 2012 at the same spot in Starbucks where they had first met for coffee four years earlier - they married soon after . Today he weighs 178lbs and has dropped from a 72-inch to a 34-inch waist. He and Beth are both certified fitness trainers and often do 5Ks, 10Ks, half-marathons and triathlons together. ‘Love, acceptance and encouragement [were] the difference-makers for me,’ he concluded. 'If you do a little at a time, you can gain so much.' All of the health problems Lee previously suffered from have now been reversed.","Lee Jordan, 50,  would eat up to 12,000 calories-a-day .

"Parents who deprive their children of love and kindness could be jailed for up to ten years under a proposed new law. Changes to child neglect legislation would make ‘emotional cruelty’ a crime for the first time under what is being dubbed a ‘Cinderella Law’. David Cameron vowed there is 'nothing more important than the protection of children', as details emerged of the new offence which is expected to be included in the Queen's Speech in June. Changes to child neglect legislation would make 'emotional cruelty' a crime for the first time under what is being dubbed a 'Cinderella Law'. File picture . The new law would make it a crime to . deliberately harm a child’s ‘intellectual, emotional, social or . behavioural development’ and sits alongside the physical or sexual abuse . of children. Those found guilty would face up to ten years in jail. The change will update existing laws in England and Wales. Currently, adults responsible for a child can only be prosecuted if they have deliberately assaulted, abandoned or exposed a youngster to suffering or injury to their health. The updated law could include deliberately ignoring a child or depriving them of love over prolonged periods, which would be deemed to have damaged a child’s emotional development. The Prime Minister's official spoeksman said: ‘There is nothing more important than the protection of children. 'This is an area of concern. One of the issues that has been raised by the groups that have considerable expertise in this area is that the law has not been updated for some time. 'In terms of legislation, I cannot comment on what may or may not be in the Queen’s Speech but it is certainly something that is under very active consideration.’ Other new offences could include forcing a child to witness domestic violence, making a child a scapegoat or forcing degrading punishments upon them. Robert Buckland, a Conservative MP and part-time judge who has been campaigning on the issue, said the ‘time for change is long overdue’. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said: ‘Not too many years after the Brothers Grimm popularised the story of Cinderella, the offence of child neglect was introduced. Overdue: Robert Buckland said: 'Our criminal law has never reflected the full range of emotional suffering experienced by children' ‘Our criminal law has never reflected the full range of emotional suffering experienced by children who are abused by their parents or carers. The sad truth is that, until now, the wicked stepmother would have got away scot free.’ He added: ‘We need a clear, concise and workable definition of child maltreatment — an alternative code that reflects the range of harm of done to children and which provides appropriate legal mechanisms to tackle some of the worst cases. 'Emotional neglect must be outlawed, the term ""wilful"" should be replaced and the criminal law should be brought into line with its civil counterpart.’ As many as 1.5 million British children are believed to suffer from neglect. The legal changes will allow police to intervene earlier and build a criminal case before children are physically or sexually abused. At the moment, civil intervention by social workers is only possible when abuse is classed as emotional neglect. Campaigners pushing for a change in the law have included Women’s Aid, which says current legislation focuses too much on specific incidents, such as an assault – and not enough on psychological harm. They also say the law fails to take into account power and control, which are the essence of domestic abuse. Women’s Aid, domestic abuse group the Sara Charlton Charitable Foundation and stalking advice service Paladin have also urged the Government to criminalise ‘coercive control’, patterns of abusive behaviour that causing psychological harm, in order to make it easier to prove long-running abuse. In an online survey of 258 abuse victims carried out by the groups between December and last month, 88 per cent said they did not think the criminal justice system took psychological harm into account.","'Emotional cruelty' could be crime under proposed child neglect legislation .

"A sociology professor in Sweden has recommended NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden for the Nobel Peace Prize. In a letter addressed to the Norwegian Nobel Committee and published in Swedish newspaper Västerbottens-Kuriren, Professor Stefan Svallfors nominated Snowden for his 'heroic effort at great personal cost' shedding light on the expansive cyber-spying conducted by the U.S. National Security Agency. Because of his bravery, Snowden 'helped to make the world a little bit better and safer,' Svallfors wrote. Scroll down for full letter . Swedish supporter: Stefan Svallfors, professor of sociology at  Umea University, sent a letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee nominating Edward Snowden for the Nobel Peace Prize . A nomination for Snowden would be symbolic because it shows 'that individuals can stand up for fundamental rights and freedoms.' History: The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to 124 times since 1901 . Svallfors compares Snowden's act to the rulings in the Nuremberg trials of 1945 because 'I was just following orders' was not held as a viable excuse for the Nazis who carried out human rights atrocities. Svallfors also believes this will help the Peace Prize regain some of respect it lost after prematurely awarding Barack Obama the award in 2009. 'It would show its willingness to . stand up in defense of civil liberties and human rights, even when such a . defense [could] be viewed with disfavor by the world's dominant . military power.' But it may be too late for Snowden to receive the award this year. Nominations for laureates must be postmarked no later than February 1 for consideration in the following December's prizes. Between the months of March and August the advisers review the short list of candidates. However, Svallfors' nomination should be taken seriously by the committee for next year's prize. As . a sociology professor at Umeå University, he counts as one of the . 'qualified' people who can send their nominations to the committee. These qualified people include: members of national assemblies and governments of states; members of international courts; university rectors; professors of social sciences, history, philosophy, law and theology; directors of peace research institutes and foreign policy institutes; recipients of the prize; board members of organizations that have been awarded the prize; active members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee; former advisers of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The Nobel Peace Prize was started in 1901 and has been awarded to 100 individuals and 24 organizations. Qualified: As a professor of sociology at Umeå University in Sweden, Svallfors is one of the few that are allowed to make recommendations to the committee . The process: Candidates are nominated before February 1 and then go through a nearly year-long review up until the December award ceremony . Too soon: Many criticized the premature awarding of the peace prize to President Barack Obama in 2009 . It was the last prize described in Alfred Nobel's will, which left most of his fortune to the creation of the prizes. Other Nobel Prizes are awarded in the areas of physics, chemistry, medicine and literature. The peace prize is awarded each year to 'the person who . shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between . nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the . holding and promotion of peace congresses.' Though Snowden is eligible for nomination for the December 2014 prize, it's unlikely he'd be able to travel to Oslo for the award ceremony. Snowden applied for asylum in Norway on July 2, but the country then planned to reject it according to their national law. 'According to Norwegian law, one can't seek asylum abroad and the normal procedures stipulate that the asylum application from Edward Snowden will be rejected,' Paal Loenseth, Northwegian state secretary told news agency NTB. If Snowden is awarded the prize in 2014, he would be the youngest Nobel Peace Laureate in the history of the prize. Best committee members!I suggest that the 2013 Peace Prize awarded to the American citizen Edward Snowden.Edward Snowden has - in a heroic effort at great personal cost - revealed the existence and extent of the surveillance, the U.S. government devotes electronic communications worldwide. By putting light on this monitoring program - conducted in contravention of national laws and international agreements - Edward Snowden has helped to make the world a little bit better and safer.Through his personal efforts, he has also shown that individuals can stand up for fundamental rights and freedoms. This example is important because since the Nuremberg trials in 1945 has been clear that the slogan ""I was just following orders"" is never claimed as an excuse for acts contrary to human rights and freedoms. Despite this, it is very rare that individual citizens having the insight of their personal responsibility and courage Edward Snowden shown in his revelation of the American surveillance program. For this reason, he is a highly affordable candidate.The decision to award the 2013 prize to Edward Snowden would - in addition to being well justified in itself - also help to save the Nobel Peace Prize from the disrepute that incurred by the hasty and ill-conceived decision to award U.S. President Barack Obama 2009 award. It would show its willingness to stand up in defense of civil liberties and human rights, even when such a defense be viewed with disfavour by the world's dominant military power.Sincerely,Stefan Svallfors Professor of Sociology at Umeå University .","Stefan Svallfors, sociology professor at Umeå University, nominated Edward Snowden for the Nobel Peace Prize .

"The lack of universities in some parts of England is depriving pupils of the chance to gain a degree – despite achieving good grades at school, according to a new study. These middle-class higher education 'cold spots' can be found in the border areas between England and Wales, along the Cumbrian coast, in Humberside and North Yorkshire, from Kent to the Wash and in the south-west, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) said. In Corringham and Fobbing, Thurrock, Essex, for instance, it would be expected, based on academic performance at school, that 43.4 per cent of school leavers would go to university – but the actual figure was just 25.6 per cent. Scroll down for video . There are middle-class higher education 'cold spots' in the border areas between England and Wales, along the Cumbrian coast, in Humberside and North Yorkshire, from Kent to the Wash and in the south-west . The interactive HEFCE map below shows the cold and hot spots in England for university participation: . The report painted a similar picture in Dorchester East, Dorset, where 48.1 per cent of school leavers would be expected to go on to higher education, but just 31.3 per cent actually did. The picture, however, is fairly complex. For example in Leeds and Birmingham, where there is a relatively high number of higher education institutions, the proportion of young people progressing to higher education is lower than expected in relation to their GCSE attainment. With a few exception, much of Lincolnshire has a low proportion of students entering higher education. Red denotes low numbers, moving up through orange, yellow, turquoise and dark blue (the highest) South Wales also has a high number of regions where students are largely not progressing to university . Likely due to free university places, Scotland has a high proportion of students entering higher education . The report is the first time that school and higher education data together with employment and mobility data has been meshed to give a comprehensive and detailed picture of higher education participation and provision, employment and graduate mobility. Professor Madeleine Atkins, HEFCE Chief Executive, said that the report, which includes an interactive map of  the education cold spots, could be used to identify areas where new campuses could be built. She said: 'The data shows us that the issues associated with higher education cold spots can often be complex.' Coastal regions of the north-east also suffer from low number of those heading to university . She added: 'Higher education providers, working collaboratively with their local enterprise partnerships, will be able to use this powerful new toolkit to establish a detailed picture of higher education in their localities, enabling them to identify any gaps in provision, participation and the supply of graduates. 'This provides a strong evidence base to explore potential solutions for delivering local economic recovery and growth. 'Universities and colleges play a key role as economic and social anchors in their local and wider communities. Working with local partners in this way to reach a joint understanding of the issues that affect them collectively, they can make an important contribution to the ongoing development of Strategic Economic Plans, and also, of course, to decisions about where and when to invest different forms of funding.' The lack of universities in some parts of England is depriving some pupils of the chance to gain a degree . Earlier this year research showed that the number of students who are satisfied with their degree hit a record high, although thousands still said they are not happy with the overall quality of their course. It revealed the vast majority of undergraduates are content with the teaching and learning resources on their course, but less happy with the assessment and feedback they receive. Undergraduates at Bath University, Keele University, St Andrews University and St Mary's University College are among the happiest with their degree, according to the annual National Student Survey.","There are large areas of England that lack university provision, a study said .

"If you’ve ever spilt water on a hot pan, you’ve seen the Leidenfrost Effect in action. The skittering and fizzing that takes place happens because the surface is super-hot- about twice as hot as the liquid's boiling point. This causes the water to levitate on the evaporated gas vapour which acts a barrier that keeps the droplet and the hot surface separated. Scroll down for video... The skittering of water occurs because a surface is about twice as hot as the liquid's boiling point. This causes the water to levitate on the evaporated gas vapour which acts a barrier that keeps the droplet and the hot surface separated . When a liquid hits something really hot - about twice as hot as the liquid's boiling point - it never comes directly in contact with its surface. This is because vapour acts as a barrier that keeps the two separated.  The skittering of water you see when it hits a hot pan is the Leidenfrost effect. Bath University’s Alex Grounds and Richard Still looked at how droplets travel on different textured surfaces, heated at varying temperatures. They found that they could change the direction of the droplets’ movement by changing the temperature of the ratcheted surface. They also found that droplets can be made to climb up a steep incline – the sharper the teeth of the surface, the steeper incline they were able to climb. And so the Leidenfrost Maze was created. The maze guides the water droplets in different directions using specially-arranged grooved hotplates. ‘We think the droplets change direction depending on how fast the gas evaporates from the surface of the droplet and how much the droplet is levitating, combined with the effect of the textured surface that allows it to be propelled along and even go uphill,’ said researcher Alex Grounds. The . research could be used to develop more sophisticated methods for . controlling small droplets and heat transfer, such as cooling systems . without moving parts.

"Up to half the food we buy from supermarkets goes in the bin despite much of it being perfectly edible, a report reveals today. Experts say a throwaway consumer culture that undervalues food is behind the colossal waste. They blame confusion over sell-by dates and retailers’ ‘buy one, get one free’ offers that tempt shoppers into buying more than they need. Waste: Seven million tons of food, worth more than £10billion, is wasted in the UK every year, according to a report by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers . Across the country seven million tons of food, worth more than £10billion, is thrown away annually – costing the average household £480 each year. Of the food binned by families, from fresh fruit and veg to tinned and packet produce, £1billion worth is still within its sell-by date and good to eat. The report, by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, says that up to three quarters of vegetables grown in Britain ends up never being eaten, with large amounts being left in the field or rejected by supermarkets for being too ugly. Confusion: The report's author places some of the blame for food wastage on special offers in supermarkets that result in consumers 'buying more produce than they need' Author Dr Tim Fox, head of energy and environment at the IME, said that over a lifetime an average household will throw away up to £24,000 worth of food. He said: ‘Between 30 and 50 per cent of food bought from supermarkets is thrown away. It gets home from the shops, placed in the cupboard or fridge, and then up to half of that food goes in the bin. ‘One of the problems is the way supermarkets retail. Consumers end up buying more produce than they need because of special offers. Many of these items have a limited shelf life, so they end up being thrown away. ‘And with much of our fresh fruit being imported from around the globe, it does not have the lifespan of locally produced food because it has already spent days travelling. ‘There is also confusion over labelling and sell-by dates, with many people opting to throw away perfectly good food.’ The average British family spends only 11 per cent of its budget on food, which explains why it is not valued more highly, the report found. Dr Fox said: ‘With the shift away from small shops on the High Street to large-scale supermarkets, we have lost the sense of value of food.’ Almost a third of vegetables are never harvested and are ploughed back into the field because of overproduction and for aesthetic reasons, according to the report, Global Food: Waste Not, Want Not. ‘Many farmers produce more than is necessary as back-up to meet the strict criteria in the supply agreements set by supermarkets,’ said Dr Fox. Warning: Author of the report Dr Tim Fox said between 30 and 50 per cent of food bought in supermarkets is thrown away and warned that people had 'lost the sense of value of food' With a further 30 per cent never . making it to the supermarket shelf because they are considered too ugly . to be sold, only half a farmer’s crop is likely to be sold. The . misshapen produce is either left to rot in the field, sold off to be . added to manufactured products such as soup, used as animal feed, or put . in composting. But, once consumer waste is factored in, up to three-quarter of vegetables never make it on to a family’s plate. Dr Fox said: ‘It is remarkable that you get any food to the table at all. Up to 75 per cent of the veg grown in the UK doesn’t end up being eaten. That’s the bottom line. ‘With a lot of vegetables, it is simply the fact that it just doesn’t look right. The crop is not harvested simply because it will not sell, but apart from appearance they are perfectly edible. ‘Although schemes are in place to sell some of this veg in different outlets, not enough is being done to tackle this waste.’ The picture remains the same across the globe, with around half of all food produced – two billion tons worth – lost to waste. But in developing countries the issue is one of storage rather than profligacy. Others have queried the report’s figures, with the food waste campaigners WRAP saying only one fifth of all the food and drink we buy as consumers ends up unused in the bin. Unused: Food waste expert Emma Marsh said that preparing too much food was one reason for waste, while misunderstanding over labels was another factor . Food waste expert Emma Marsh said: ‘Our research has shown that 7.2million tons of food and drink waste is generated by households in the UK each year. Of this, 4.4million tons is avoidable food waste. This avoidable food waste has a value of £12billion per year.’ She said that preparing too much food was one reason for waste, while misunderstanding over labels was another factor. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, which represents retailers, said: ‘Using more of the crop to cut food waste and increase sustainable production is an objective for all retailers. This is how we are exceeding Government targets for food waste. ‘It was supermarkets that lobbied Europe to relax strict marketing rules on fruit and veg to allow us to sell more misshapen produce. This has led to an enormous increase in the sale of “wonky” veg. ‘We’ll continue to work with growers to use more British produce, cut food waste and give customers great value. It’s a win, win, win.’","Seven million tons of food worth £10billion is thrown away every year .

"As millions of Americans are scrambling to get their tax returns postmarked by this evening, a smaller sect did something much more drastic and renounced their US citizenship. Last year alone, almost 1,800 people renounced their U.S. citizenship or handed in their Green Cards – and many of them said it was because of tax reasons. That's a record number since the Internal Revenue Service began publishing a list of those who renounced in 1998. It's also almost eight times more than the number of citizens who renounced in 2008, and more than the total for 2007, 2008 and 2009 combined. No longer American: Genette Eysselinck, who renounced her U.S. citizenship to become Belgian, poses in Place de la Comedie; last year, almost 1,800 people renounced their U.S. citizenship or handed in their Green Cards . Not worth it: American ex-pats still must pay taxes on their earned income and are subject to complicated filing laws . The United States is one of the only countries to tax its citizens on income earned while they're living abroad. And just as Americans stateside must file tax returns each April - this year, the deadline is Tuesday - an estimated 6.3 million U.S. citizens living abroad brace for what they describe as an even tougher process of reporting their income and foreign accounts to the IRS. For them, the deadline is June. The National Taxpayer Advocate's Office, part of the IRS, released a report in December that details the difficulties of filing taxes from overseas. It cites heavy paperwork, a lack of online filing options and a dearth of local and foreign-language resources. For those wishing to legally escape the filing requirements, the only way is to formally renounce their U.S. citizenship. Last year, IRS records show that at least 1,788 people did, and that's likely an underestimate. The IRS publishes in the Federal Register the names of those who give up their citizenship, and some who renounced say they haven't seen their name on the list yet. Alarming: Since the IRS started publishing those renounced in 1998, numbers have skyrocketed . In fact, Superman declared plans to renounce his U.S. citizenship a year ago, in Action Comics.'Truth, justice, and the American way' - it's not enough anymore,' the comic book superhero said, after both the Iranian and American governments criticized him for joining a peaceful anti-government protest in Tehran. The State Department said records it keeps differ from those published by the IRS. They indicate that renunciations have remained steady, at about 1,100 each year, said an official. The decision by the IRS to publish the names is referred to by lawyers as 'name and shame.' That's because those who renounce are seen as willing to give up their citizenship primarily for financial reasons. There's also an 'exit tax' for the very rich who choose to leave. During the last 25 years, a number of millionaires and billionaires have renounced their citizenship. Among them: Ted Arison, the late founder of Carnival Cruises, and Michael Dingman, a former Ford Motor Co. director. Mad money: A woman wearing a a Statue of Liberty costume encourages people to get their taxes done before today's deadline . Tuesday blues: Javier Merlo (centre) and his wife Robin Merlo do their taxes at an H&R Block office in Miami, Florida . Leaving: An Action Comic last year had Superman renouncing his citizenship . But those of more modest means renounce, too. They say leaving America is about more than money; it's about privacy and red tape. Two filing requirements affect Americans abroad: the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts - which has been around since 1970 but now carries penalties for noncompliance - and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, passed in 2010 with the aim of reducing offshore tax evasion. The first regulation requires all Americans, including those living abroad, with at least $10,000 in overseas bank accounts, to file a supplementary form disclosing all of their foreign accounts. That includes any accounts in which the U.S. citizen has a financial interest. That could include a joint account with a spouse or child, accounts for corporations in which the American owns more than 50 per cent of the value of shares of stock, or any trust or estate that benefits the U.S. citizen. The tax compliance act - the newer law - asks foreign financial institutions such as banks, hedge funds, and private equity funds to provide the IRS with information on U.S. clients. The United States and five European Union countries recently announced their intent to allow institutions to report the information through their own governments, rather than directly to the IRS. Institutions that do not comply will be subject to a 30 per cent withholding tax on certain U.S.-sourced payments and proceeds of property sales beginning in the 2013 tax year - for instance, dividends on investments in U.S. companies. Some expatriates say they were unaware of the first regulation for years and even decades. In 2008, the IRS received only 218,840 such filings. American nationality law grants citizenship to almost everyone born in the United States or born abroad to American parents, regardless of how much time they've spent in the United States. Many may not even know the extent of their U.S. ties. Advocate: Lucy Stensland Laederich co-runs FAWCO, a women's expat organization serving overseas Americans and the international community . In 2004, the stakes for noncompliance rose. Failure to file meant potential fines and criminal charges. Americans abroad can be punished for noncompliance even if they owed no income tax - and IRS data show that most of them don't owe money. Income up to $95,100 isn't taxed under a rule called the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion. In 2009, the income cap was $91,400, and 88 per cent of all taxpayers claiming the foreign earned income exclusion owed nothing. Since 2008, the IRS has offered several voluntary-disclosure grace periods during which expatriates can file back taxes without facing criminal charges - but with the possibility of incurring penalties. Marylouise Serrato, head of American Citizens Abroad, a non-profit organization based in Geneva, says that many members feel scared about reporting requirements they did not know existed. Their disenchantment, she says, is pushing some to renounce. 'Americans abroad are terrified. We've . had people pay tens of thousands of dollars in fines.' -American Citizens Abroad's Marylouise Serrato . 'Americans abroad are terrified. We've had people pay tens of thousands of dollars in fines. We've had people … pay huge amounts of back taxes,' she says. 'Up to this point, we never heard of anyone renouncing, or if they did, they didn't talk about it,' says Ms Serrato, who says her group does not advocate renunciation. 'Now,' she says, 'we're seeing a lot of people speak openly about it and come to us for information.'Congress is taking note. 'While I fully support measures that reduce fraud and address offshore havens, the U.S. should not have policies that place undue burdens on legitimate Americans abroad,' says Representative Carolyn Maloney, D-NY, and the chair of the Congressional Americans Abroad Caucus. Ms Maloney says she has taken the matter to the Department of the Treasury, which oversees the IRS. The IRS did not respond to requests for comment. Lawyers report that banking is a big reason why people renounce. 'I hear about banking problems again and again and again,' says Phil Hodgen, an attorney who has been helping Americans expatriate since 2008. The new reporting rules, he says, pose 'a huge administrative burden. It's made Americans too expensive to keep.'","Record 1,800 people renounced U.S. citizenship last year alone, up eight times the number of those who did in 2008 .

"David Cameron said it was 'amazing' that Labour opposed the idea of ensuring jobless families could not receive more in handouts than those in work . Benefits claimants will not be able to receive more from the state than the average working household earns under a tough new £26,000-a-year cap launched today. David Cameron said it was a ‘big day for benefits reform’ as the cap was imposed in the first areas ahead of the nationwide rollout from this summer. Larger families and those living in the London are expected to be hardest hit by the decision to limit benefits to £500-a-week for couples and single parents and £350 for single people. The policy has proven hugely popular in Downing Street polling, with the Prime Minister saying ‘amazingly’ Labour oppose the idea of insisting handouts should not be higher than average incomes in homes where someone goes out to work. The changes are being introduced to cut Britain’s vast welfare bill and bring the level which can be claimed on benefits into line with average earnings. The average household will lose £93-a-week. Mr Cameron wrote on Twitter: ‘A big day for welfare reform as we pilot a cap on benefits equal to the average wage. Amazingly Labour oppose it.’ Half of the 56,000 affected affected by the cap are lone parents while 39 per cent are couples with children. One in 10 families have more than six children and almost half of all those hit by the cap live in Greater London. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: 'The benefit cap is a key part of our reforms to restore fairness to the welfare state. 'It will provide clear incentives for people to get into employment and will give taxpayers the assurance that high claims out are no longer possible. 'We have also ensured vulnerable people are protected with clear exceptions for people claiming disability benefits. 'But we have a very clear message: we will provide support to those who need it, but the days of outrageous claims giving people incomes far above those of hard working families are over.' The Prime Minister said the start of the changes marked a big day for the governments moves to overhaul Britain's welfare system . The clampdown on out-of-work benefits is part of a raft of changes the government is introducing to curb steep rises in the UK's benefits bill . The cap, expected to save £275 million in 2013-14,  covers out-of-work benefits such as Jobseekers Allowance, plus Housing Benefit, Child Benefit and Child Tax Credit. However, there are exemptions if someone in the household receives Working Tax Credit, Disability Living Allowance, Personal Independence Payment, Attendance Allowance, Industrial Injuries Benefits and War Widows and War Widowers pension. From today the cap comes into force in the four London boroughs of Croydon, Bromley, Haringey and Enfield. National roll-out will begin in July, with the policy coming fully into force in October as part of wider reforms to combine a raft of benefits into a single Universal Credit. More than half of the 56,000 families affected by the benefits cap have four or more children, according to estimates by the Department for Work and Pensions . Mathew Oakley, head of economics and social policy at right-leaning think tank Policy Exchange, said: '£26,000 a year is an awful lot of . money. For this reason, it is completely right to assess what level of . support taxpayers are willing to give to any one family. 'We also need to . remember that unconditional support is still available to those on . disability benefits that the government does not expect to work: they . are exempt from the cap.' Ministers claim the prospect of the . cap being introduced has already acted as a spur to encourage the . jobless in the London pilot areas to find work, with 8,000 fewer people . affected than planned. Employment minister Mark Hoban said: . ‘Over the course of the last few months we’ve been working with families . affected by the cap - Job Centre Plus and local councils - and what we . have seen is 8,000 people go into work, and we’ve seen fewer people . affected by the benefit cap. Ministers claim 8,000 fewer people will be affect by the benefits cap than first thought after more people found work . ‘So, whereas back in July we thought 56,000 families would be affected, now it’s 40,000 families,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘I think what people want to see is a benefits system that’s fair, that’s affordable, and that encourages people into work. These reforms help deliver that.’ But some charities have warned people affected with struggle to make up the short fall in the income, and could be forced to move away from the area in which they live. Fiona Weir, chief executive of the Gingerbread charity for single parents, said: 'Half of those affected by the benefit cap will be single parents and we are deeply concerned about the impact this will have on families and communities. 'The cap doesn’t begin to tackle the underlying problems of the shortage of low-cost social housing and the difficulties that single parents face in finding family-friendly jobs, affording childcare and making work pay. 'More than twice as many children than adults will be affected by the cap.  We fear that many children will be pushed deeper into poverty or uprooted from their communities, schools and family networks as a result.' Opponents have also questioned the use of the figures to suggest the cap is already working. Jonathan Portes, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and a former chief economist at the Department for Work and Pensions, said there was ‘no evidence at all’ that the cap had affected people's behaviour. ‘The actual analysis published by the Department for Work and Pensions makes it quite clear that they do not attempt to analyse any impact of behavioural change and that there is as yet no evidence one way or the other that there is behavioural change,’ he said last week. But the DWP said that it had followed the correct procedures in publishing the data. ‘The original forecasts were based on impact assessments last year and have now been updated due to further developments,"" a spokesman said. ‘We have followed the correct procedures . for publishing this data by our statisticians and it is available for . anyone to study. Claims to the contrary are utterly unfounded.’ Almost nine in 10 of those affected by the cap have children, the DWP said . Stephen Timms, Labour’s shadow employment minister, said: 'For all the Tory rhetoric, the true picture of this Government is one of economic failure. 'They are having to borrow £245 billion more than they planned, not to pay for the investment needed to grow our economy, but to pay for more welfare spending caused by high unemployment. 'We desperately need a change of direction. Labour has called for a compulsory jobs guarantee to give the long-term unemployed a job, which they will have to take up or lose their benefits.'","Benefits cap limiting handouts to £500-a-week comes into force .

"Troubled footballer Paul Gascoigne has a new love in his life who, friends hope, may save him in his battle against alcohol. The 47-year-old was seen near his home in Poole, Dorset, with Mandy Thomas, a public services worker who was reportedly by his side while he recovered in hospital following a recent relapse. Ms Thomas, who is separated from her husband and has two children, is 'besotted' with the star with whom she has become 'inseparable'. The footballer was seen walking arm-in-arm with Mandy Thomas, 44, rumoured to be his new girlfriend . Friends close to the former England star say Ms Thomas could help him 'save him from himself' The 44-year-old from Bournemouth was seen walking hand-in-hand with Gascoigne this week on the beach in Sandbanks, Dorset. 'She is the best thing that has happened to him for a long time,' a friend close to the couple told The Sun. 'People are hoping she could be the woman who saves him from himself. 'She has been spending a lot of time with him and they have become virtually inseparable.' Gascoigne, who split from his wife Sheryl in 1999, has been single for two years. Ms Thomas is separated and has two adult children. Friends described her as 'the best thing that has happened' to the footballer for a 'long time' Tender moment: The couple were seen in a warm embrace as they got out of the car in Dorset . Gascoigne recently moved in to a new home in Poole, Dorset, and has been enjoying a healthier lifestyle . Together they had a son, Regan, and the footballer adopted her two children from a previous marriage. Following their divorce, the mother-of-three told of his alleged abusive tendencies in a biography, Stronger: My Life Surviving Gazza. Gascoigne divorced his wife Sheryl (pictured) in 1999 . In 1999 Sheryl was reportedly granted a lump sum of £660,000 and promised yearly cash installments. As her former husband fell further into the pits of alcoholism however, the former model claims she began giving him financial help. In a 2010 interview she described his desperate lifestyle, saying: '‘I always wanted to be the one to fix it. 'If ever he was going to get well, I wanted to be the one there, not someone else.’ His last known girlfriend was model Kelly Windsor. The couple met on a dating website and began seeing each other in Bournemouth. He previously spoke of his finding it difficult to meet women given his high-profile past. 'I’ve got someone’s number, they’ve asked what’s your name, I say Paul Gascoigne. I wait, and I know what they’re gonna do – they’re gonna google it,' he told the Daily Mirror. 'Then I get, ""You mean the footballer Paul Gascoigne?"" Then it’s, ""Sorry, the date’s off."" ' Earlier this month the star was pictured in the garden of his new home looking healthy and happy, weeks after photographs emerged showing him looking frail and clutching a bottle of gin. Reports circled that Gascoigne, a former England footballer, had been evicted from his luxury flat in Sandbanks in September. He has been enjoying a healthier lifestyle since, having been pictured on angling trips near his home on numerous occasions. In the summer the star was photographed clutching a chicken in a pub beer garden and being turned away from an off-licence in Poole. Mr Gascoigne walked along the beach alone at one point during their excursion, stopping to speak with friendly locals enjoying the autumn weather . The former footballer stopped to speak to a man with a dog as a child played with a bucket and spade nearby . Gascoigne greets a swimmer on the beach as he made one of his first public outings with Ms Thomas .

"Nicole Maines changed her name from Wyatt in the fourth grade . Although born identical twin boys, Wyatt Maines had never felt the same as brother Jonas. While Jonas played with Spiderman and pirates, Wyatt preferred Barbie and tutus. From a young age, Wyatt did not identify with the gender he was born into and with the help of incredibly supportive parents, Kelly and Wayne, began to live life as a girl. Wyatt became Nicole in the fourth grade and now takes hormones to stop male puberty. Nicole, now aged 14, told the Boston Globe: 'I have always known I was a girl. I think what I’m aiming for is to undergo surgery to get a physical female body that matches up to my image of myself.' My brother and I: Nicole and Jonas Maines, 14, were born as identical twin boys but Nicole (who changed her name from Wyatt) now lives as a girl with the full support of her family in southern Maine . It has been a long struggle for the . Maines family, from southern Maine, to have their child accepted for who she is. Along the . way they have faced legal battles, discrimination, bullying and have moved . home. After Wyatt repeatedly denied he was a boy and started acting out, Mrs Maines began doing research . on transgender children but there was little information to be found. The Maines were fortunately put in touch . with the Children’s Hospital Gender Management Services Clinic in . Boston, opened in 2007 by endocrinologist Norman Spack and urologist . David Diamond. Mr Maines, a 53-year-old safety director at the University of Maine, told the Boston Globe: 'I didn’t understand it all, but I saw the weight lift off Kelly’s shoulders and a smile in Nicole’s eyes. 'That was it for me. There were tons of challenges for us after that, but I knew my daughter was going to be OK, medically.' Identical: From an early age the twins showed distinct personalities with Jonas preferring pirates and Spiderman while Wyatt preferred Barbie and mermaids . The GeMS Clinic is the first of its kind . in the U.S to focus on children and teenagers with gender identity . issues. They have a multifaceted team including specialists in . gynecology, urology, social work and psychiatry. Using hormone therapies, the clinic . halts puberty in transgender children, blocking the development of characteristics like breasts or facial hair, which can make the final steps to the other gender more painful and expensive. 'I believed in Nicole. She always knew who she was.' Kelly Maines, mother . In the fourth grade, Wyatt grew longer hair and started wearing more girly clothes and by fifth grade had her name legally changed to Nicole. Mrs Maines, 50, who works in law enforcement, told the Boston Globe: I believed in Nicole. She always knew who she was.' There were very few problems with classmates or their parents until one boy called Nicole a 'faggot' and objected to her using the female bathroom. The boy's grandfather complained to the school board backed by the Christian Civic League of Maine. The superintendent of schools then decided Nicole should use a staff bathroom causing the Maines to bring a discrimination case against the school. Jonas also ended up getting into fights to defend his sister. After several incidents of prejudice and bullying the Maines moved to a more diverse community in the state with more liberal schools. The Maines family spoke out to help fight the deep stigma against transgender youth. Happy with what's in the mirror: Nicole Maines, 14, sits at her dressing table - she has endured a long emotional journey to live as a girl . By her side: The Maines' family (l-r) Jonas, Nicole, mother Kelly and father Wayne. They have fought many battles for Nicole but have fully supported her being transgender . The transgender portion of the population has been largely ignored and vastly under-serviced for many years. All too often transgender individuals are at greater risk of social rejection, sexual and physical violence. The shame and rejection felt by some . can lead to self-harming behaviours, increased drug use, homelessness, . HIV/AIDS infection, depression and suicide. The Youth Suicide . Prevention Program states that 50 per cent of transgender youth will have had . at least one suicide attempt by their 20th birthday while two-thirds said they felt unsafe at . school. There are arguments, in particular from the Christian right, about the morality of changing gender and some doctors consider young teens too immature to make such life-altering decisions. Close bonds: The brother and sister whisper with each other as they tell their story at the family's home in southern Maine . However Dr Spack, 68, who has decades of experience working with transgender youth and adults told the Boston Globe: 'We’re talking about a population that has the highest rate of suicide attempts in the world, and it’s strongly linked to non-treatment, especially if they are rejected within their family for being who they think they are.' The effect of the hormone injections are striking when looking at Jonas and Nicole - the first set of twins the clinic has seen. Jonas is 5ft 6 inches and weighs 115 pounds, is going through puberty and has developed facial hair. Nicole is 5ft 1inch and 100 pounds. Jonas told the Globe: 'I love having a sister. We have a very strong relationship.' Nicole added: 'I would say my brother got lucky with me. Because we grew up with only . boy neighbours, I developed a liking to shoot-’em-up and military video . games. I could have come out a lot girlier.'",Nicole Maines changed her name from Wyatt in the fourth grade .
"A virus gene that could be poisonous to humans has been missed when GM food crops have been assessed for safety. GM crops such as corn and soya, which are being grown around the world for both human and farm animal consumption, include the gene. A new study by the EU's official food watchdog, the European Food Safety Authority(EFSA), has revealed that the international approval process for GM crops failed to identify the gene. A new study conducted by the EU has shown that standard tests for GM foods may be missing a potentially poisonous gene for humans . As a result, watchdogs have not investigated its impact on human health and the plants themselves when assessing whether they were safe. The findings are particularly powerful because the work was carried out by independent experts, rather than GM critics. It was led by Nancy Podevin, who was employed by EFSA, and Patrick du Jardin, of the Plant Biology Unit at the University of Liege in Belgium. They discovered that 54 of the 86 GM plants approved for commercial growing and food in the US, including corn and soya, contain the viral gene, which is known as 'Gene VI'. In this country, these crops are typically fed to farm animals producing meat, milk and eggs. Significantly, the EFSA researchers concluded that the presence of segments of Gene VI 'might result in unintended phenotypic changes'. Such changes include the creation of proteins that are toxic to humans. They could also trigger changes in the plants themselves, making them more vulnerable to pests. Critics say the revelations make clear that the GM approvals process, which has been in place for 20 years, is fatally flawed. They argue the only correct response is to recall all of the crops and food products involved. Director of the campaigning group, GM Freeze, Pete Riley, said the discovery of the gene, 'totally undermines claims that GM technology is safe, precise and predictable'. He said: 'This is a clear warning the GM is not sufficiently understood to be considered safe.  'Authorisation for these crops must be suspended immediately, and they should be withdrawn from sale, until a full and extended review of their safety has been carried out.' Typically, GM crops are modified in the laboratory to give them resistance to being sprayed with powerful weed killers such as Monsanto's Round-up. This means that, in theory, fields can be doused with the chemical, so wiping out the weeds and allowing the food plants to thrive. It was previously assumed that virus genes are not present in plants once they are grown in the field and reach consumers, however it is now clear that this is not the case . The modification process involves inserting genes into the plants using a technique that allows them to piggyback on viruses that are commonly found in the soil and plants. It has been assumed that virus genes are not present in the plant once it is grown in the field and reaches consumers, however it is now clear that this is not the case. A review of the EFSA research in Independent Science News said the presence of the viral gene appears to have been missed by biotech companies, universities and government regulators. 'This situation represents a complete and catastrophic system failure,' it said. 'There are clear indications that this viral gene might not be safe for human consumption. It also may disturb the normal functioning of crops, including their natural pest resistance. 'A reasonable concern is that the protein produced by Gene VI might be a human toxin. This is a question that can only be answered by future experiments.' Biotech supporters argue that there is no evidence from countries such as the USA that eating GM food causes any harm. However, the reality is that no health monitoring has taken place to establish this. The findings will embarrass the government and the food and farming Secretary, Owen Patterson, who has embarked on a pro-GM propaganda exercise designed to win over sceptical consumers. Mr Patterson recently rejected public concerns as 'humbug' and 'complete nonsense'. Policy director at the Soil Association, Peter Melchett said: 'For years, GM companies have made a deliberate and chilling effort to stop independent scientists from looking at their products. 'This is what happens when there is a complete absence of independent scrutiny of their GM crops.'  Biotech firms are represented by the Agricultural Biotechnology Council(ABC). Its chairman, Dr Julian Little, said the EFSA study was one small part of a strict and complex scrutiny process. He said: 'Over the past 25 years, the European Commission has funded more than 130 research projects involving 500 independent research groups which have found no higher risks to the environment or food chain from GM crops than from conventional plants and organisms. 'Furthermore, nearly three trillion meals containing GM ingredients have been eaten without a single substantiated case of ill-health. The combination of these two facts can give consumers a huge amount of confidence in the safety of GM crops.' GM critics and EFSA are at odds over the implications of the research paper, which was written by the deputy chairman of the organisation’s advisory panel on the issue and a former senior member of staff. EFSA insists that the research highlighting the presence of Gene VI does not represent a new discovery of a viral gene and does not indicate a safety concern about GM crops already approved. It said the viral gene ‘cannot infect animals or humans and therefore presents no threat to human or animal health’. This is challenged by GM critics who say there is no research evidence to justify this statement.","EU watchdog reveals approval for GM foods fails to identify poisonous gene .

"Dr Michael Houlton is launching a legal bid to recover paintings he claims were looted from his family by the Nazis . A British doctor has launched a legal battle to recover masterpieces looted from his family by the Nazis that he believes form part of a $1 billion treasure trove of paintings discovered in Germany. Dr. Michael Hulton, 67, is the great-nephew of Alfred Fleichtheim, a famous Jewish art collector whose galleries were ransacked after he fled from Berlin to London in 1933. Now working as an anaesthetist in San Francisco, Dr Hulton told the Mail that his lawyers reached an agreement two years ago with Cornelius Gurlitt - the son of Hildebrand Gurlitt, an art dealer who traded plundered works for the Nazis – after he tried to sell a painting once owned by Mr Fleichtheim for £720,000. The painting – The Lion Tamer by Max . Beckmann – had been given to the collector by the artist himself in . return for 'living expenses.' 'I asked him at the time, ""Are there any others?"" We had no idea.’ It . wasn’t until Sunday when Dr. Hulton’s relatives sent him a BBC report . saying German customs officials had found 1,400 paintings in Guritt’s . cluttered Munich apartment that he realised he may have discovered what . happened to many more of his great uncle’s stolen collection. Dr Hulton said he had not been contacted by the German authorities since the find last year. He believes the hiudden cache of artworks it may contain other works by Beckmann. Mr Flechteim also owned works by the likes of Picasso, Klee, Monet, Renoir and Matisse. Sold: Dr Michael Hulton claims the painting The Lion Tamer by Max Beckmann, which Gurlitt tried to sell for £750,000 before the collection was discovered, belonged to his great-uncle Alfred Fleichtheim .

At the very least it would have been courteous for him to have been notified. 'They say they don’t want any Tom, Dick or Harry to turn up but with all due rerspect we are no Tom, Dick or Harry. 'It is a matter of justice and family honour. It really hit a nerve. We will be making a formal application in Germany to remind Munich that we don’t consider the mater closed. 'I just wish my father was alive to see this, although he would be over 100 now.' Remarkable: A painting from Henry Matisse called Sitzende Frau (Sitting Woman) - one of the previously unknown works found at Gurlitt's flat - is projected on a screen during a news conference in Augsburg. It is worth an estimated £50-£60million . Never-before-seen: A painting of Otto Dix called Selbstportrait Rauchend (Selfportrait Smoking) Control: Hitler only liked classical art and held exhibitions of modern 'dissident' pieces to show German people what not to like.

"Bill Clinton has given an emotional tribute to an eight-and-a-half months pregnant Harvard graduate who worked for his foundation before she was gunned down in the Kenyan mall massacre. Speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative on Tuesday, the former president remembered Dutch-born Elif Yavuz, 33, who was killed with her Australian architect boyfriend, Ross Langdon, in the mall used by Westerners in Nairobi. Yavuz, a malaria specialist, was working for the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation at the time of her death and had moved to Nairobi as she deemed it the safest place to give birth. Clinton, who met Yavuz six weeks ago, remembered her as a 'brilliant young mother-to-be who did everything she could to make the most of her life' and called Langdon 'incredibly gifted and good'. Scroll down for video . Struggle: Speaking at the Clinton Global . Initiative on Tuesday, Bill Clinton became emotional as he remembered meeting Elif . Yavuz just six weeks before she was killed in Kenya. He called her a 'brilliant young mother-to-be' Emotional: He said he was 'a little choked up' as he just spoken to Yavuz's grieving mother, who said she was hoping to name the couple's unborn child after a Swahili word for 'life' or 'love' He recounted the moment he met Yavuz when he traveled to Africa to meet his employees. 'This . beautiful woman comes up to me, very pregnant,' he said. 'She was so . pregnant that I assured her that I was a Lamaze father and could be . pressed into service at any moment. 'She . and her baby's father, they went to Nairobi because they thought it was . the safest, best place for her to give birth... and they were just . walking in the mall that day. And they were killed.' Struggling . to keep back his tears, Clinton added that he was 'a little choked up' as he had just spoken with Yavuz's mother on the phone. She and her . family had decided to name the unborn child after a Swahili word for . 'life' or 'love', he said. He . added: 'I'm very grateful that this young woman gave so much of her . life in working with our foundation. I am sorry that she gave her life.' Loss: Elif Yavuz, who worked for the Clinton Foundation, was killed in the Kenya mall massacre. Bill Clinton and his family called her 'brilliant and dedicated' as they shared their condolences . The former president and his family also paid tribute to Yavuz on their foundation's website. 'Elif devoted her life to helping others, particularly people in . developing countries suffering from malaria and HIV/AIDS.' They added that she had previously worked with the foundation's Health Access Initiative as she worked on her doctoral studies before recently rejoining as a senior vaccines researcher in Tanzania. 'Elif was brilliant, . dedicated, and deeply admired by her colleagues, who will miss her . terribly,' the Clintons wrote. 'On behalf of the entire Clinton Foundation, we send our . heartfelt condolences and prayers to Elif’s family and her many friends . throughout the world.' The couple were two of the 62 people who lost their lives in the days-long attack at the mall. Images which are too graphic to print show Langdon cradling his love, the burger and chips they had just bought scattered across the floor. Prize-winning British-Australian architect Ross Langdon, and his Harvard-educated pregnant partner, Elif Yavuz, were killed in the Nairobi shopping centre siege . Devastating: Elif, who was due to give birth in a fortnight, was killed alongside Mr Langdon, a prize winning architect who had joint British and Australian nationality. He is pictured right giving a TED talk . The . takeaway counter next to them is riddled with AK-47 bullets, sprayed by . members of terror cell Al Shabaab at anyone deemed to be non-Muslim.. Mr Langdon had been involved with a number of projects across Africa, which included designing an HIV-Aids hospital in Kenya free of charge. The London-based architect could be seen photographed with Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, in a picture posted on his Facebook profile earlier this year. Mr Langdon, who studied architecture at the University of Tasmania then the University of Sydney, worked for several companies before founding his own firm Regional Associates Ltd in May 2008. Born and brought up in south-eastern Tasmania, his work included projects in Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania. Heartbreaking: The young couple are among the more than 60 people slaughtered by terrorists this weekend . Ms Yavuz had lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, while studying at the renowned Harvard University. Esther . Waters-Crane, a British expat who was an acquaintance of Elif's, . described her grief at losing the expectant mother, and how Kenya has . reacted to the unprovoked attack. She said: 'I'm so, so sad about Elif. We had been in regular contact about her birth her in Nairobi and . I feel sick/angry/furious/shocked by this tragic, tragic waste of lovely people. 'Nairobi is awash with helicopters right now. 'I'm . at home and the explosions from Westgate are so loud they sound like . they're on my road.

"The Italian government is to sell scores of historic properties to help it tackle its huge budget deficit. A haunted fortress, a cardinal’s palace and an island in the Venetian lagoon are among 50 sites for sale. The move recalls 2012, when Greece was forced to sell off some its beautiful islands to foreign buyers, to chip away at its enormous debts. The Italian government hope that the nation’s treasures will be bought by private businesses and converted into hotels, restaurants and museums, bringing much needed employment and international investment. Minister for the economy Fabrizio Saccomanni aims to make £425million from the sell-off. It was approved as part of an emergency decree aimed at keeping Italy’s 2013 budget deficit within 3 per cent to avoid corrective action by Brussels. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Enrico Letta is planning a further £1billion of austerity measures. Italian property expert Rupert Fawcett said the scheme made ‘logical business sense’. The idea was first mooted last year by Mario Monti, the technocrat who took over as Prime Minister in December 2011, when Silvio Berlusconi took public debt to unsustainable levels. The ‘Kill Public Debt’ plan originally listed 350 properties but officials now deem that some assets, such as military airbases, are poorly suited for the commercial market. The properties are to be marketed through a state-run fund who will advance the money to the Treasury, selling off the assets as buyers are found, the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported. The properties include Orsini Castle, which sits above its own feudal village near Viterbo, about 60miles from Rome. The medieval fort was built for Pope Nicholas III in the 1270s and has a Euro 15 million price tag. Said to be haunted, it was used as a prison from the mid-19th century to 1989 and has since been an art gallery. In Venice the properties on offer include the Island of San Giacomo in Palude, north-east of Murano.The island was inhabited by monks and friars from the 11th century before it became a military base in the 1800s. Since it was abandoned in 1961, it has fallen into ruin but could appeal to international investors as a luxury resort. Other national treasures to go under the hammer include the 18th century palace, Villa Mirabello. The frescoed villa, set in parkland near Monza, close to Milan, was built in the 18th century by Cardinal Durini, the Inquisitor of Malta. Property expert Rupert Fawcett head of Knight Frank Italy said the scheme made ‘logical business sense’. Tackling deficit: Prime Minister Enrico Letta will follow the sale with £1billion of austerity measures next year . He said: ‘The reality is that any government in Europe is looking to raise funds where they can. The cost of running these properties can be huge and the sheer upkeep of them can be unmanageable. ‘If properties can be bought by private investors, restored to their former glory it’s good for everyone. It benefits local communities and puts some money in the state coffers.’ Head of the Italian employers federation Confindustria, Giorgio Squinzi, said to cut the deficit Italy’s needed ‘drastic action’. ‘Continuing with the status quo our country will remain, at zero or low growth.’ It is not the first time Italy has sold off assets. Last year a succession of lighthouses on the island of Sardinia were sold off to private businesses and converted into hotels, galleries, and museums. The island’s autonomous government could no longer afford the cost of maintaining and restoring them. Greece's sale last year of 70,000 lots included beaches, ski resorts and islands.","A fortress, a palace and an island will be auctioned to tackle the deficit .

"Pricey: A shortage of Halkidiki olives could push the price up by as much as 50 per cent . Green olives, a dinner party staple, could soon shoot up in price after bad weather in the Greece put them in short supply. Premium Halkidiki olives, are set to cost up to 50 per cent more, after poor conditions in the region where they are grown affected the harvest. Farmers have reported that crop yields are down by up to 80 per cent, meaning that anyone wanting to enjoy them in the UK will have to pay more. This could mean that 150g of pitted green olives at a supermarket would cost shoppers £3, instead of their usual price of around £2. The problem is worsened by the fact that earlier this year, the effects of a drought in Spain and areas of Southern Europe saw production of Spanish olives falter too. With suppliers looking to Greece to bridge the gap, the disappointing final yield is now set to affect prices of premium and chilled olives, which are often sold stuffed in supermarkets and delis. Halkidiki olives, which are known for their pleasant, sour taste, are traditionally harvested from the middle of September. But much of this year's crop fell foul of unusually high temperatures, with many growers seeing little or no olives produced. An olive farm in the Greek countryside close to Patelidas in the Halkidiki region of northern Greece . And the problem has prompted many Greeks call for action from the European Parliament, to help them through the olive growing crisis. The crop, forms a large part of Greece's export trade, and a poor harvest could spell trouble for the country's struggling economy. Boxes of Halkidiki olives getting ready to be transported from a farm . According to the Olive Oil Times website, left wing Greek MEP Nikos Chountis spoke for the growers earlier this year, and opened a discussion on whether the current conservative government is doing enough to help. Speaking during a session of the European Parliament, he said:  'What other actions can be taken directly by the Greek government to give a boost to one of our most important economic exports?' The olive crisis is further bad news for lovers of delicacies in Britain. Chocoholics have been forced to scour the shops for their favourite Green & Black's organic chocolate and almond bar after a nut shortage saw the sweet treat sell out. Retailers up and down the country have seen demand for the upmarket treat, which costs £2.29 for a 100g bar, by far outstrip supply in recent weeks. Both Waitrose and Wholefoods have confirmed that they have already sold out. The unexpected shortage is believed to have been caused by problem in the supply of almonds, which are imported from harvesters in Europe and America. California, which grows 80 per cent of the world's almonds, suffered under the effects of a prolonged drought which led to smaller nuts being harvested this year.","Many Greek farmers reporting little or no green olive yield this year .

"Fortified with barbed wire, and defended by machine guns and mortar, it was once a symbol of the bloody Battle of the Somme - fiercely fought over by British and German forces. Now, the Butte de Warlencourt - one of the most iconic features of the Great War - stands overlooking the landscape of Northern France, almost unrecognisable. Overgrown and unkempt, the mound, once a position of great strength for German forces, affording them clear views across the surrounding countryside and their opposition, was destined to be bulldozed to make way for housing by French developers.

The Western Front Association bought the site 23 years ago from a local farmer for £7,500 in a bid to preserve it for future generations, the Express reports. The group has now chosen to transform it into a 'must visit' location. They plan to restore the pathway to the summit, install new walkways and handrails, and also place memorial benches around the site. They will mount information boards on the mound explaining its historical significance. The project will start in the autumn and the group aim to be finished in time for next year’s commemorations. During the Battle of the Somme the Butte became an obsession. In German possession throughout 1916 it only came into Allied possession in 1917, after the German retirement to the Hindenburg line in February, despite an earlier attempt by British forces to gain control of it.

"The Denver Police are now under investigation by the FBI for brutality, after a video surfaced online showing an officer punching an unarmed drug suspect six times in the face and causing the man's seven-months-pregnant wife to trip and fall on the ground. The video obtained by Fox Denver is also raising questions about whether the officers involved in the incident violated cell phone search laws, since the witness claims they grabbed his tablet and tried to delete the clip - though they would need a warrant in order to take any of his devices. Bystander Levi Frasier was driving to work on August 14 when he saw an incident escalate between a man and a few cops and undercover officers, so he pulled over, took out his tablet and started recording the scene. Police say the incident started when suspect David Nelson Flores noticed plainclothes officers approaching him, and he tried stuffing a white sock full of what was believed to be heroin into his mouth. WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES: Scroll down for video . Brutal: A video has surfaced showing the moment a police officer punched a suspected drug user six times in the face during an arrest last August . Injured: Suspect David Nelson Flores (pictured) sustained several injuries to his face and head during the attack . Flores was then tackled to the ground as the undercover cops, and back-up officers Charles Jones IV and Christopher Evans, arrived on the scene and tried to pry the sock out of the mans mouth. When Flores refused to spit up the sock, Officer Charles Jones IV punched the suspect six times in the face, his head bouncing off the pavement as he receives the blows. 'Those were the hardest punches I have ever heard,' Frasier said. 'I’ve seen some people get punched in the ring and on TV and whatnot, but the sound of those resonating, I mean, it was scary. I’ve never heard anything louder than that and I used to cage fight for quite a while and I’ve never seen punches harder than that.' And that's not all. Jones proceeded to trip Flores' girlfriend, 25-year-old Mayra Lazos-Guerrero , when the seven-months-pregnant woman approached the tustle and started yelling at them to stop hurting her boyfriend. Charged: Flores (left) and his girlfriend 25-year-old Mayra Lazos-Guerrero (right) face several charges related to the incident, but were no shows at their last court date . Shove: The video also shows how one of the officers pushed Guerrero when she approached the group, telling them to stop hurting her boyfriend . Expectant: Guerrero was seven-months-pregnant when she fell to the ground in the incident . Guerrero falls to the hard cement, landing on her  stomach and face and is seen yelling out in pain, clutching her bump. However, the officer has explained his use of force, saying he was trying to retrieve the heroin and also prevent Flores from clutching. As for Flores' girlfriend, Jones says he thought she was going to kick him. Frasier doesn't think she her behavior was threatening: 'She was screaming like, ""What are you doing. Let him go! Let him go! Stop hurting him! What are you doing?"" She was just concerned for him. You could clearly hear that and as she got closer.' Fox Denver also obtained pictures of Flores' wounds as he was being transported to the hospital. The graphic images show his battered head, bloody from being hit on the pavement as well as bruises and cuts all over his head. But Mark Carlson, a former detective hired to analyze the video for Flores' potential criminal case, says he believes the officers went over the top in their use of force. Illegal search? Witness Levi Frasier says police officers grabbed his tablet after the incident and then deleted the video. He was able to save the clip though, since it was uploaded to his cloud before the device was taken by authorities . 'There’s no obvious and immediate threat of a weapon,' Carlson said. 'I just don’t see how either swallowing evidence or they’re worried about him choking is justifying that degree of force. I mean, you’re risking, ""We don’t want you to choke, so we’re going to fracture your face instead?""' The FBI Public Corruption Unit is now working with the internal investigators with the Denver Police to see whether the determine whether the incident is a case of police brutality. The officers behavior after the incident is also under investigation by the FBI, for possible breaches of cellphone search laws. Frasier says in the aftermath of the fight, officers approached him and coaxed him to hand over his tablet, even though he told them that they needed a warrant to do that. When they handed the tablet back to him, the video had been deleted, but he was able to salvage the clip since he had already been uploaded to his cloud. Flores was charges with resisting arrest, and two felony drug charges, while his girlfriend faces charges of obstruction, drugs and child abuse (there was a child in the car when the arrest happened). Neither appeared at their most recent court appearance, and are being asked to turn themselves in. Denver Police Commander Matt Murray responded to the video with a statement saying: 'We are not covering anything up. There is no cover up whatsoever, so let me just put that to rest. That’s irresponsible and baseless.'","Denver police being investigated by FBI for brutality against suspect .

"Sharp edge: Mouthwash Corsodyl can lower blood pressure . Using mouthwash is a ‘disaster’ for health, increasing the risk of heart attacks and strokes, scientists are warning. Swilling kills off ‘good’ bacteria that help blood vessels relax – so increasing blood pressure. When healthy volunteers used Corsodyl, a brand containing a powerful antiseptic, their blood pressure rose within hours. Professor Amrita Ahluwalia, who led the study, last night condemned the widespread use of antiseptic mouthwash. She said: ‘Killing off all these bugs each day is a disaster, when small rises in blood pressure have significant impact on morbidity and mortality from heart disease and stroke.’ More than half of British adults regularly use mouthwash, creating a market worth £180 million a year. The study compared blood pressure levels in 19 healthy volunteers who started using Corsodyl twice daily. Their blood pressure rose by between 2 and 3.5 units (mmgh). This effect ‘appeared within one day’ of using the mouthwash, researchers wrote in the journal Free Radical Biology And Medicine. For each two-point rise in blood pressure, the risk of dying from heart disease rises by seven per cent, according to separate research. Such a rise also increases the risk of dying from stroke by ten per cent. Heart disease and stroke are the biggest killer in Britain. Prof Ahluwalia, from Queen Mary University of London, said: ‘We are not telling people to stop using antiseptic mouthwashes if they have a gum or tooth infection – but we would ask why anyone else would want to.’ Dangerous rinse: The study by Queen Mary University in London found that blood pressure in daily Corsodyl users rose by between 2 and 3.5 units . Corsodyl contains 0.2 per cent by volume of the antiseptic chlorhexidine. Other antiseptic mouthwashes made by Boots and Superdrug contain the chemical in the same concentration. It kills microbes needed to help create nitrite, essential for blood vessels to dilate properly. But the mouthwash caused nitrite production in the mouth to fall by over 90 per cent, and  blood nitrite to fall by 25 per cent. Not all mouthwashes contain chlorhexidine: Listerine, for example, does not. However, Prof Ahluwalia said: ‘Other mouthwashes could still disrupt the healthy bacteria.’ Dentist Richard Guyver said he would be ‘very cautious about drawing conclusions’ from such a small study. Corsodyl makers GlaxoSmithKline said their product was for short-term use to stop plaque and prevent gum disease and it also makes another product, Corsodyl Daily, which contains 0.06 per cent chlorhexidine for everyday use. The spokesman said their own research had ‘not highlighted any concerns regarding the use of Corsodyl 0.2 per cent mouthwash as directed and increases in blood pressure’.","Mouthwash brand Corsodyl has been found to increase blood pressure .

The organizations runs a pet adoption center and neuter clinic and Corgan posed on their magazine with two cats that he adopted called Sammi and Mr Thom. The headline 'Billy Corgan's Siamese Dream' referred to the alternative band's second album released in 1993. He has supported the organization in the past, raising $60,000 after auctioning off a private concert. But when Cooper discovered the cover last month, he ridiculed it live on air. He said: 'So perhaps Billy Corgan is, I don't know, off his alternative rocker. Corgan, pictured on stage at Glastonbury last year, responded on Twitter calling Cooper a 'globalist shill' 'But I think maybe there's more to this, maybe he's being ironic, or maybe when the cool rock stars start doing less rock starry things, it kind of makes us face our own mortality. 'See I want REM to stay just the way I know and love them, I don't want 'Everybody Hurts' to suddenly be used in an Excedrin commercial.' He added: 'Maybe the Internet is the real problem here. There was a time when nobody outside of Chicago would have ever seen the cover of PAWS Chicago magazine.' Corgan responded with a tweet calling Cooper a 'globalist shill' and adding: 'Sorry to disappoint, but when I'm not raising cain for a great organization like @PAWSchicago, I'm still making REAL music.' @ZuZusTeahouse posted this picture on Twitter with the message: 'Awesome tea and Merch at the @SmashingPumpkins concert tonight!!

"Creed frontman Scott Stapp threatened to kill his family after drugs drove him to believe biological weapons were coming to Florida, his wife's divorce papers claimed. The revelation comes a day after Stapp, 41, recorded a desperate, 16-minute Facebook video revealing he is now broke, homeless, and living in a Holiday Inn. According to his wife of eight years, former Miss New York Jaclyn Nesheiwat, the father-of-three sent a text message that read: 'Florida is not safe. Biological weapons on the way. U have to leave with kids and meet me in Atlanta.' Another said: 'I'm coming to get you Satan and children. No mercy. You know how this ends. God created you and now God is ending you.' Stapp denies allegations of drug abuse, insisting he's as 'sober as can be'. Scroll down for video . Dispute: Jaclyn Stapp claims her estranged husband, Creed frontman Scott Stapp, threatened to kill her and their children in a drug-fueled text rant. The With Arms Wide Open singer claims he is 'as sober as can be' 'I went two days without eating and I ended up in an emergency room': Creed frontman Scott Stapp revealed he was broke and homeless in a desperate, 16-minute Facebook video posted Wednesday . On Wednesday he took to Facebook lambasting the claims, revealed in the Miami Herald. He said 'all hell broke loose' after an audit of his record company and personal accounts found 'people have stolen money from me'. Admitted to followers that he is now homeless, he explained: 'Right now I'm living in a Holiday Inn by the grace of God, because there's been a couple weeks where I had to sleep in my truck. 'I had no money not even for gas or food. I went two days without eating because I had no money and I ended up in an emergency room.'

In the video, the Dying to Live crooner pleads his sobriety to his children - Jagger, 16, Milan, 7, and Daniel, 4 (pictured in August) But 15 years after the release of hit single With Arms Wide Open, Stapp is 'completely penniless'. 'During the course of that audit a lot of things were uncovered. A lot of money was stolen from me or royalties not paid,' he said. 'There's people who have taken advantage and stolen money from me, and they're trying to discredit me, slander me, and I've even been threatened that if I went public like I'm doing right now, that any impropriety I've done in the past, that these individuals can get their hands to humiliate and embarrass me and try to ruin my credibility.' He added: 'The IRS has frozen my bank accounts two or three times to leave me completely penniless. 'I don't even understand that, why all this is happening at the same time. When I called to find out why, they said, ""Oh we had an address mix-up, it was a clerical error, so we'll return your funds in nine to 10 months."" I don't understand how that's fair America.' The comment was an apparent response to his estranged wife Jaclyn Nesheiwat, who claimed he was using amphetamines, crystal meth, and steroids in her divorce paperwork. It comes seven years after the Dying To Live singer openly apologizing to Jaclyn for assaulting her with an Orangina bottle following his arrest in 2007. She dropped the charges.

"A medieval book that once belonged to King Henry VIII will go on public display for the first time today. The lavishly illustrated Aberdeen Bestiary, created in England around 1200 and first documented in the Royal Library at Westminster Palace in 1542, is part of a new exhibition at Aberdeen University. Bestiaries were illustrated books of animals, some real and some mythological, used to provide Christian moral messages. Detailed: The lavishly illustrated medieval book used animals, both mythological and real, as religious symbols to convey moral messages . The Bestiary, which has been in the possession of Aberdeen University for almost four centuries, includes animals such as deer and the panther (centre) Experts are still unsure whether the Bestiary was commissioned for a royal client or seized during King Henry VIII's reign from a dissolved monastic library . As well as lions, tigers and apes, the Bestiary references a number of mythological animals: . Bonnacon Mythical animal from Asia, that has curled horns and emits burning dung. The legend may be based on a type of bison in reality. Monoceros Single-horned animal such as a unicorn . Crocotta Mythical dog-wolf of India or Ethiopia . Parandrus Ox-sized, long-haired, animals with antlers and cloven hooves, that could change their shape at will. Yale Beast from European mythology, often goat-like four-legged creature with large horns that it can swivel in any direction. Satyr Creature from Greek mythology that were half man, half goat . They were popular in the 12th and 13th centuries but few were as lavishly produced as the Aberdeen manuscript, which has been in the care of the university for almost four centuries. It is unclear whether the Bestiary was commissioned for a royal client or seized during King Henry’s reign from a dissolved monastic library. Siobhan Convery, head of special collections at the university, said: ‘The Aberdeen Bestiary is a remarkable resource which offers a fascinating insight into the mediaeval mindset. ‘We will be turning the pages of the original Bestiary each week so we hope people will return time and time again to discover something new.’ Professor Jane Geddes, academic advisor to the exhibition, said: ‘The Bestiary is like a medieval encyclopaedia and was written to appeal to the general public and to teach children how to read. The Bestiary has been described as a 'medieval encyclopaedia' and a 'remarkable resource' Insight: Although Bestiaries were widely produced, none were so lavishly illustrated as the Aberdeen edition . The Aberdeen Bestiary includes sections on birds, including the mythical Phoenix (pictured) ‘It was specifically designed to draw . you in and that appeal has stood the test of time. It is not about . nature but about moral messages and there is a story behind each . beautiful illustration. 'The Aberdeen Bestiary is one of the most lavish ever produced but it was never fully completed and so the edges of the pages were not finished and tidied up. ‘This means that the tiny notes from those who created it still remain in the margins, revealing more to us about the method of production than most other surviving medieval books.’ The Aberdeen Bestiary is also extremely rare in having a ‘twin’, as it is widely believed to have been created by the same monks, in the same monastic scriptorium, as the Ashmole Bestiary, held at the Bodleian Library in Oxford. Professor Geddes said: ‘By comparing the two, we can access an unparalleled amount of information about how the scribes and artists actually worked.’ The Bestiary first came to Aberdeen in 1625 when it was bequeathed to the University’s Marischal College by Thomas Reid, a former regent of the college and the founder of the first public reference library in Scotland. Reid, who served as Latin secretary to King James VI, is said to have been given the book by his friend Patrick Young, son of the Royal Librarian to the King. The Gilded Beasts exhibition will be open until August 18. On display: The book is bale to be viewed for the the first time at the University of Aberdeen .

"Srinivasa Ramanujan, described as a 'natural genius', has finally had the mathematical functions he came up with on his deathbed proved correct . Researchers have finally solved the cryptic deathbed puzzle  renowned Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan claimed came to him in dreams. While on his death-bed in 1920, Ramanujan wrote a letter to his mentor, . English mathematician G. H. Hardy, outlining several new mathematical functions never before heard of, along with a hunch about how they worked, . Decades years later, researchers say they've proved he was right - and that the formula could explain the behaviour of black holes. 'We've solved the problems from his last mysterious letters,' Emory University mathematician Ken Ono said. 'For people who work in this area of math, the problem has been open for 90 years,' Ramanujan, a self-taught mathematician . born in a rural village in South India, spent so much time thinking . about math that he flunked out of college in India twice, Ono said. Ramanujan's letter described several new . functions that behaved differently from known theta functions, or . modular forms, and yet closely mimicked them. Functions are equations that can be drawn as graphs on an axis, like a sine wave, and produce an output when computed for any chosen input or value. Ramanujan conjectured that . his mock modular forms corresponded to the ordinary modular forms . earlier identified by Carl Jacobi, and that both would wind up with . similar outputs for roots of 1. Ramanujan, a devout Hindu, thought these patterns were revealed to him by the goddess Namagiri. Scroll down for video . Ramanujan claimed the patterns in numbers were revealed to him by a Hindu goddess . However, no one at the time understood . what Ramanujan was talking about. 'It wasn’t until 2002, through the . work of Sander Zwegers, that we had a description of the functions that . Ramanujan was writing about in 1920,' Ono said. Ono and his colleagues drew on . modern mathematical tools that had not been developed before Ramanujan’s . death to prove this theory was correct. 'We . proved that Ramanujan was right,' Ono says. 'We found the formula . explaining one of the visions that he believed came from his goddess.' The team were also stunned to find the function could be used today. 'No . one was talking about black holes back in the 1920s when Ramanujan . first came up with mock modular forms, and yet, his work may unlock . secrets about them,' Ono says. A highlight of working on a film about Ramanujan's life was getting to browse through some of the Indian master's original notebooks, said Ken Ono, right . 'Ramanujan's legacy, it turns . out, is much more important than anything anyone would have guessed when . Ramanujan died,' Ono said. The . findings were presented last month at the Ramanujan 125 conference at . the University of Florida, ahead of the 125th anniversary of the . mathematician's birth on Dec. 22nd. 'Raw genius' Ramanujan at Cambridge (centre) December 22, 2012 marks the 125th birth anniversary of Srinivasa Ramanujan, the self taught mathematician born into a modest and conservative family in Kumbakonam, a relatively small town in Tamilnad. Ramanujan was self-taught and worked in almost complete isolation from the mathematical community of his time. Described as a raw genius, he independently rediscovered many existing results, as well as making his own unique contributions, believing his inspiration came from the Hindu goddess Namagiri. He spent so much time thinking . about math that he flunked out of college in India twice. He overcame several hurdles to find a place among the celebrated intellectuals of Cambridge. Ramanujan passed away at the young age of 32 of tuberculosis, but he left behind formulations in mathematics that have paved the path for many scholars who came after him.","Theory came to Srinivasa Ramanujan in a dream on his deathbed in 1920 - but has never been proved .

"The reality of life on America's railroads has been captured in a series of moving and stunning photographs by Arizona-born photographer Mike Brodie. Thousands bedded down on the country's train tracks during Great Depression of the 1930s, many of whom had no where to go. Nearly a century on and the tracks remain alive with some of the country's poorest people or simply those that are enchanted by the romance of the railroad. Running from poverty or chasing their dreams, stunning photos show what life is like for America's train hoppers who, more than 100 years on from the Great Depression, are still in thrall to the country's railroads . Many of the youth who take to the tracks zig-zag across the country in freight trains, travelling thousands of miles at a time and without a final destination in mind . The photographer, Mike Brodie, now 27, spent 10 years jumping freight trains to compile his images, which he has put in a new book, A Period of Juvenile Prosperity . Mr Brodie began taking the photos in 2002 and covered 50,000 miles and 46 states on more than 170 freight train rides. He says he was unable to stop as his life with the hoppers increasingly revealed a curious portrait of the country's youth, which are to feature in his new book, A Period of Juvenile Prosperity. Mr Brodie said in the Independent Magazine: 'I never knew what these photos were going to turn into, what they were going to represent. Riding the railroads isn't without its risks, as this striking image of a train-hopper leaping daringly between carriages shows. The photograph is one of many taken by a 35mm Nikon F3 . In what is maybe the most iconic of his images, a young man by the name of Soup mimics Johnny Cash with an outstretched middle finger while hanging off the back of a speeding train . A graffiti artist gets a leg up to do his work on one of the freight trains. Many of Mr Brodie's subjects used the trains as a way of escape and experiencing the 'free lifestyle and American adventure' Mr Brodie has become a favourite among America's photographic elite, who have been blown away by the talent of someone who was self-taught . 'It was intuitive - photographing things near to me, things attractive to me, things that seemed important at the time, but I always wanted to photograph the train hoppers.' Amazingly, Mr Brodie is entirely self-taught and has stunned America's photographic establishment with his technical accomplishment. 'I learned it somehow - training myself and seeing other things quite randomly I wanted to copy,' he said. Beginning in 2002, Brodie covered 50,000 miles and 46 states on more than 170 freight train rides. The period from 2006-09 is documented in his new book, published by Twin Palms Publishers and TBW Books . Despite his success, Mr Brodie now works as a truck mechanic and still sleeps in a sleeping bag every night. He still thinks about riding the trains . The journey took Mr Brodie to all corners of the country and through some of its harshest weather. His pictures are being exhibited in Los Angeles and New York this month . Although many of his subjects used the trains as a form of escapism, Mr Brodie wasn't doing likewise. 'I can't speak for everyone but the majority just wanted a taste of that free lifestyle, that American adventure. 'As for myself, I was naturally drawn to go and...check some things out.' Now 27, humble Mr Brodie is now a car mechanic and still sleeps in a sleeping bag every night and will only start snapping again 'once he makes a life for himself'. A Period of Prosperity by Mike Brodie is published by Twin Palms at $65. An exhibition of Brodie's work is at the Yossi Milo Gallery, New York, until April 6.","Self-taught photographer Mike Brodie, 27, rode with America's impoverished youth for thousands of miles .

"CNN host Piers Morgan has said he believes the Bible and the U.S. Constitution are 'inherently flawed' and that the Bible needs an amendment changing its stance on same-sex marriage. The bold statements come days after the British journalist divided America with his strict stance on gun laws following the Sandy Hook massacre, even sparking e-petitions to deport him. While interviewing Pastor Rick Warren on his CNN show, he said: 'Both the Bible and the Constitution were well intentioned but they are basically, inherently flawed. Hence, the need to amend it.' Warren, who is against same-sex marriage replied: 'Not a chance. What I believe is flawed is human opinion, because it constantly changes.' Scroll down for video . Outspoken: In an interview with Pastor Rick Warren, Piers Morgan called the Bible 'flawed' Opinionated: He said that the Bible should be amended to change its stance on gay rights . 'But you and I know the Bible is, in many places, a flawed document,' Morgan continued. 'My point to you about gay rights for example - it's . time for an amendment to the Bible. You should compile a new Bible.' With Warren responding that he believes that the Bible reveals the truth - and the truth is never outdated - Morgan quipped: 'We’re going to agree to disagree on that.' His remarks sparked anger among conservatives, including Paul Kengor, the executive director of The Center for Vision and Values at Grove City College. 'It's remarkable to watch secular liberals like Piers Morgan assume unto themselves the extraordinary authority to divine what in the Bible is true and what is not, what is flawed and what is not, and where certain ""amendments"" supposedly need to occur,' he told Fox News. Movement: It comes after he upset Americans with his stance on guns, sparking petitions to deport him . Now a second petition on the White House website now insists he must stay in the US, not only because he has a constitutional right to free speech but also 'more important' because 'no one in the UK wants him back' It is just the latest of Morgan's outspoken opinions to be spotlighted after he offended thousands of Americans with his anti-gun remarks. He has demanded tighter U.S. gun laws following the Sandy Hook massacre and last week on Piers Morgan Tonight, he interviewed a gun advocate and called him an 'unbelievably stupid man'. On December 21, a man in Texas launched a petition on the White House e-petition website demanding Morgan be deported immediately for 'exploiting his position as a national network television host to stage attacks against the rights of American citizens'. The petition accuses Morgan of engaging in a 'hostile attack against the U.S. Constitution' by targeting the Second Amendment - the right to bear arms. Anger: People took to Twitter to lambast his latest remarks, adding to the voices who want him deported . It has already garnered more than 84,000 signatures - far exceeding the 25,000 signature threshold required to get a White House response. But Morgan seemed unfazed by the effort to oust him. In a series of Twitter messages, he urged his followers to sign the petition and in response to one article about the petition even said: 'Bring it on'. He wrote: 'If I do get deported from America for wanting fewer gun murders, are there any other countries that will have me?' But a second petition on the same . website now insists he must stay in the US, not only because he has a . constitutional right to free speech but also - 'more important' - . because 'no one in the UK wants him back'. Response: The White House defended the freedom of speech and the press on Wednesday in a long-awaited response to an online petition to deport CNN host Piers Morgan over his views on gun control . Hundreds have signed the 'Keep Piers Morgan in the USA' petition after it was proposed by Janusz Jasinski, a Birmingham-based website designer. To add to the former newspaper editor's embarrassment, a third petition is calling on Home Secretary Theresa May to stop him from returning to Britain. Appearing on the US website Change.org it has so far attracted more than 100 signatures and states: 'We got rid of him once and why should we have to suffer again. The Americans wanted him so they should put up with him.'","Comes after a petition to have him deported after he criticised pro gun campaigners attracts more than 84,000 signatures .

"He was the man who made headlines when he died from heart failure after laughing non-stop at The Goodies. Alex Mitchell’s wife Nessie, who witnessed his death, even sent Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie a letter thanking them for making her husband’s final minutes so happy. Now, 37 years on from the infamous ‘Ecky-Thump’ episode of the TV comedy, doctors think they know what caused the mysterious death. Lisa Corke is recuperating (left) after she suffered a near fatal heart attack. Doctors believe it was caused by Long QT syndrome - a condition they believe killed her grandfather (right) in 1975 . The clue came when Mr Mitchell’s . granddaughter Lisa Corke, 23, recently suffered a near-fatal cardiac . arrest while relaxing at her home. Doctors subsequently diagnosed her . with Long QT syndrome, a rare form of heart disease which causes . irregular heartbeats. Kung Fu Caper: During the episode Tim Brooke-Taylor uses a set of bagpipes to defend himself against Bill Oddie who is hurling black puddings . In this 1975 episode of The Goodies called Kung Fu Kapers, Bill Oddie demonstrates the made-up Scottish martial art of 'Hoots-Toot-Ochaye.'This consisted of fights with various assailants played by the other two Goodies, including two boxers, a French stick fighter and an Australian with a boomerang. He wins by cunningly hitting them over the head with a black pudding.He meets his match when Tim Brooke-Taylor takes him on armed with the bagpipes. However, Tim loses after he is hit over the head by the returning boomerang thrown earlier by the Australian. Oddie celebrates his victory after it's announced by the umpire. As the condition is hereditary, they believe . Scottish Mr Mitchell, a bricklayer who lived in Norfolk, must have also . suffered from it and triggered a collapse with his laughing fit. Mrs Corke, from the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, said: ‘My granddad died from one of the most famous strange deaths. ‘I think at the time they probably . thought he suffered a heart attack caused by the laughter, but doctors . realised he died from cardiac arrest caused by Long QT syndrome after . examining me.’ She now has a cardioverter-defibrillator in her chest, . which detects arrhythmia and corrects it with a jolt of electricity, and . will have to take medication for the rest of her life. The Goodies ran from 1970 to 1982. The . 1975 Ecky-Thump episode – actually called Kung Fu Kapers – featured . Brooke-Taylor as a kilted Scotsman who uses his bagpipes to defend . himself against Oddie, a master of the ancient Lancastrian martial art . of Ecky-Thump, which involves hitting people with black puddings. Mr Mitchell’s widow, who is now 86, . said at the time: ‘Alex was a Scot and it tickled him to see a Scotsman . fighting with his bagpipes. The programme was nearly over when he . collapsed.’ Taking it easy: Lisa Corke with her husband Mick and her children Ellie (right) and Amelie. She can no longer do any strenuous exercise . Long QT syndrome is an inherited disorder of the heart's electrical rhythm that affects around one in 10,000 people. Usually symptoms appear in the teenage years but it may not be picked up till later in life. A sufferer can experience short episodes of having a fast, abnormal heart rhythm which can lead to other symptoms such as fainting. These episodes can be triggered by intense exercise, emotional excitement or fear. There is often no warning before an episode but most people 'come round' again after two minutes as the heart rhythm returns to normal. However, very occasionally the disruption can be life-threatening. Medication can control the symptoms, although some patients need a pacemaker to regulate the heart. If you have experienced fainting associated with exercise or strong emotions, and especially if there is a history in your family of the same problem, it's important to discuss it with your GP.

It will not be the first time the river Thames sees a flotilla of thousands of boats take to its waters in the wake of a royal barge. In 1822 King George IV made the first state visit to Scotland by a reigning monarch since Charles II's coronation in January 1651. The King left Greenwich, in London, followed by thousands of tributary vessels, in scenes immortalised by Robert Havell in his famous 1922 watercolour, The Embarkation of George IV for Scotland. The Embarkation of George IV for Scotland in 1822: The watercolour, by Robert Havell, shows the royal yacht attended by city barges, steamers and a host of smaller vessels and huge crowds at Greenwich cheering the flotilla . In 1849 Prince Albert took two of his sons to the opening of the Royal Coal Exchange followed by thousands of Londoners eager to sail as close to the Royal Family as possible. That barge was called Prince Frederick's Barge and, unlike the Spirit of Chartwell, courtiers had to row all the way from Parliament to the new exchange. Prince Frederick's Barge was . then sawn into three sections and stored in the Royal Barge House at . Windsor Great Park for over 100 years before being brought to the . Museum.

"School district officials in California will meet to discuss a fight that broke out between three female students and a transgender female student that was caught on camera last week. A member of the West contra Costa Unified School Board said the panel intends to meet on December 2 to address the fight as well as bullying in general.Disturbing footage of the fight shows much pushing, hair-pulling, chasing and screaming. Write caption here . Chase: According to police, the transgender girl (left) hit another girl, who chased her and began a brawl (right) According to police, a male student who identifies as female hit a female student outside at the school. That girl and two others then chased and began fighting with the transgender student. All four students were suspended but according to board member Charles Ramsey, two have since returned to school. The Bay Area Reporter says that two of the students have indicated to police that they want to press charges for battery against the transgender teen. Playground fight: The school district will meet to discuss the fight and bullying among students . For her part, the transgender teen wants to press charges against the two girls who attacked her. She also indicated that she wants to transfer out of Hercules High School because 'the harrassment is too much.' 'The board takes this very seriously, and we are not going to sit idly by and let these activities take place,' Ramsey said. 'We want parents and families to know that we have safe campuses.' While the fight involved a transgender student, police did not find any evidence that the fight was a hate crime, Hercules police Detective Connie Van Putten told KTVU. Bullying: The fight was reportedly sparked by ongoing harassment against a 16-year-old transgender student by a group of girls . Unfair fight: Two girls can be seen pulling the hair and hitting the transgender girl . Despite this, the transgender teen reported being bullied by two of the girls previously. 'It's not about the transgender issue,' Adam Taylor, executive director of K-12 Schools at the West Contra Costa Unified School District told the Bay Area Reporter. 'It's really about friendships or allegiances that kids see.' According to the Bay Area Times, the school district has an anti-harassment policy in place but it does not address sexual orientation or gender identity.","A California school district board will meet to address a fight that broke out between three girls and a transgender girl .

"A cup of camomile tea could help ward off cancer, researchers say. The tea contains a chemical, apigenin, which takes away some of the ‘superpowers’ of cancer cells. Scientists at Ohio State University found apigenin can block the ability of breast cancer cells to live far longer than normal cells, halting their spread and making them more sensitive to drug therapy. Camomile tea, parsley and celery are the most abundant sources of apigenin but it is also found in many fruit and vegetables common in a Mediterranean diet. Researchers have found that camomile tea contains a chemical, apigenin, which takes away some of the 'superpowers' of cancer cells . The chemical, which has also been shown to act as an anti-inflammatory, works in a way that suggests other nutrients could have similar effects in warding off cancer. It helps proteins correct the abnormalities in RNA – molecules carrying genetic information – that are responsible for about 80 per cent of cancers. Molecular geneticist Professor Andrea Doseff, of Ohio State University, said: 'We know we need to eat healthfully, but in most cases we do not know the actual mechanistic reasons for why we need to do that. 'We see here the beneficial effect on health is attributed to this dietary nutrient affecting many proteins. 'In its relationship with a set of specific proteins, apigenin re-establishes the normal profile in cancer cells. We think this can have great value clinically as a potential cancer-prevention strategy.' Cancer cells thrive by inhibiting a process that would cause them to die on a regular cycle subject to strict programming. The researchers found apigenin could stop breast cancer cells from inhibiting their own death. Apigenin - found in the tea - can block the ability of breast cancer cells to live far longer than normal cells, halting their spread . Much of what is known about the health benefits of nutrients is based on epidemiological studies that show strong positive relationships between eating specific foods and better health outcomes, especially reduced heart disease. But how the actual molecules within these healthy foods work in the body is still a mystery in many cases, and especially with those linked to lower risk for cancer. The researchers also showed apigenin binds with an estimated 160 proteins in the human body, suggesting other nutrients linked to health benefits called ‘nutraceuticals’ might have similar far reaching effects. In contrast, most pharmaceutical drugs target a single molecule. The researchers, whose findings are published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, likened their technique to ‘fishing’ for the human proteins in cells that interact with small molecules available in the diet. Prof Doseff said: 'You can imagine all the potentially affected proteins as tiny fishes in a big bowl. 'We introduce this molecule to the bowl and effectively lure only the truly affected proteins based on structural characteristics that form an attraction. 'We know this is a real partnership because we can see that the proteins and apigenin bind to each other.' Experiments established apigenin had relationships with proteins that have three specific functions. Among the most important was one known as hnRNPA2 which influences tiny bits of DNA called mRNA containing the instructions needed to produce a specific protein. Abnormalities in these are responsible for about 80 percent of all cancers. The researchers observed apigenin’s connection to the hnRNPA2 protein restored the function of mRNA to breast cancer cells, suggesting when they are normal cells die in a programmed way, or become more sensitive to chemotherapeutic drugs. Added Prof Doseff: 'So by applying this nutrient, we can activate that killing machinery.' The beneficial effects of nutraceuticals are not limited to cancer, as the investigators previously showed that apigenin has anti-inflammatory activities. The scientists noted that with its multiple cellular targets, apigenin potentially offers a variety of additional benefits that may even occur over time. The researchers are now testing whether food modified to contain proper doses of the nutrient can prevent cancer in mice.","Tea contains a chemical, apigenin, which can halt the spread of cancer cells .
