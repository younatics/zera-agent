"By . Rick Dewsbury . UPDATED: . 10:20 EST, 21 October 2011 . Syrian protesters have poured into the streets today and shouted that President Bashar Assad's regime will be the next to unravel now that Muammar Gaddafi is dead. The Syrian uprising has proved resilient over the past seven months, but it has shown some signs of stalling in recent weeks as the government continues a bloody crackdown the UN estimates has killed more than 3,000 people. But inspired by the dramatic scenes in Libya, protesters poured into the streets and burned images of the despised leader. Syrian security forces fired on protesters today, killing at least four, activists said. Although the mass demonstrations in Syria have shaken one of the most authoritarian regimes in the Middle East, the opposition has made no major gains in recent months, it holds no territory and has no clear leadership. Public anger: A protester uses a shoe to beat a picture of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad during a revived protest today . Female protestors show their hands with colors of the Libyan revolution flag, Yemen and Syria flags during a demonstration in Yemen today . Flames of unrest: Protesters carry banners and step on pictures of al-Assad after burning them during a protest today . Now the armed uprising in Libya that drove Gaddafi from power - with Nato air support - appears to have breathed new life into the Syrian revolt. 'Gaddafi is gone, your turn is coming, Bashar,' protesters shouted in the central city of Hama, long a hotbed of resistance to the regime. Gaddafi's death, after he was dragged from hiding in a drainage pipe, begging for his life, decisively ends the 42-year regime that had turned the oil-rich country into an international pariah. 'Our souls, our blood we sacrifice for you, Libya!' Syrian protesters chanted. The revived protests in Syria today came as Barack Obama hailed Muammar Gaddafi's death as a warning to dictators across the Middle East that iron-fisted rule 'inevitably comes to an end. Obama said the fall of Tunisia, Egypt and now Libya in revolutions dubbed the Arab Spring proved that the leaders of Syria and Yemen should be fearful of similar endings. Protests that broke out in Syria in March have so far seen more than 3,000 people killed after the leadership's violent military response. Washington has demanded that Bashar al-Assad, the country's leader, halt his crackdown on democracy protests and step down. The White House is also pressing Yemen's longtime president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to leave office in the face of political upheaval. How things can change in a year: Four dictators are pictured together last October smiling and laughing but months later president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali from Tunisia, left, was the first to fall. To his right is Yemen's Ali Abdullah Saleh, who is clinging to power. Gaddafi, in shades and golden robes, is now dead. Egypt's former president Hosni Mubarak, right, was ousted in February . Obama has also condemned Iran's human rights record and is seeking further sanctions against Tehran over an alleged foiled plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington. 'For the region, today's events prove once more that the rule of an iron fist inevitably comes to an end,' Obama said. Obama stressed that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had lost his legitimacy to rule. The leader said the United States would be a partner to Libya's interim government and urged a swift transition to democracy but made no specific promises of aid. The warnings from Washington were backed up by Libyan revolutionaires themselves, who vowed to help their 'brothers and sisters in Syria' fight for freedom. 'This is the fate of a leader who destroyed the lives of his people for decades and opened fire on them before his demise,' said Mohamed Beltagy, senior member of Egypt's influential Muslim Brotherhood. How it all began: Demonstrators throws stones at police during clashes in Tunisia in January as the 'Arab Spring' revolutions started in the Middle East . Jubilant: Egyptians carry a flag through Tahrir Square earlier this year as it becomes clear that Mubarak's reign had come to an end . 'Gaddafi's fate should be a lesson for Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad and Yemen's (Ali Abdullah) Saleh,' he said. The warnings were welcomed by Syrian dissidents who have continued their struggles. 'If I were a member of the regime, Bashar or [his brother] Maher, I would start to feel rather concerned,' said Amr al-Azm, a Syrian dissident in the United States and member of the opposition, told the Independent. The presidents of Tunisia and then Egypt were the first to be ousted in the 'Arab Spring' that has brought ordinary people onto the streets to demand political change where many kings and presidents have ruled for decades. But Tunisia's Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali and Egypt's Hosni Mubarak were driven out by protests with relatively little violence. Gaddafi, whose bloodied body was shown in footage carried by Arabic television channels, was ousted after months of fighting during which he turned the full might of his army against rebels, firing missiles, artillery and other heavy weapons at them. 'Hell awaits Gaddafi. I hate to rejoice in anyone's death, but what he did to his people was atrocious,' said Nancy El Kassab, an Egyptian television executive producer. In the firing lines: Defiant Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, left, and Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, right, are being condemned for their violent crackdowns on people protests . Unrest: A dissident Yemeni soldier stands guard as protesters march in Sanaa, Yemen, during an anti-regime rally earlier this month . 'Gaddafi's death will scare Arab dictators like Assad and Saleh, and make other Arab leaders more careful with their people after they recover from the shock of the news,' said Alia Askalany, 27, an Egyptian marketing manager. In Libya, many could hardly contain their joy. 'Thank God ... With the rebels will this was achieved and we thank everyone who helped us and we are so happy,' said Khaled Al-Asoud, a 35-year-old Libyan fighter. In Jordan, Abdullah al-Khatib, former UN special envoy to Libya and one-time Jordanian foreign minister, said: 'Other somehow similar systems in the region should draw their conclusions and listen to the voice of the people and should create the conditions whereby people of the region can freely and openly determine their future and destiny.' Stark warning: U.S. President Barack Obama added pressure to Syria and Yemen . Activists in Syria's central city of Homs told Avaaz, a campaigning rights organisation, that people celebrated Gaddafi's death in the streets. Some held placards saying: 'The rat of Libya has been caught, next is the germ of Syria.' But some questioned how much of a domino effect Gaddafi's demise might have elsewhere in a region, including Yemen where President Saleh has clung on to power in a nation riven by tribal conflicts even after he was wounded in an attack that prompted him to seek treatment in neighbouring Saudi Arabia. '(Gaddafi) deserves it, he killed a lot of people. I don't believe this will happen in Yemen because there are a lot of divisions there,' said Omran Ahmed, a Yemeni living in Egypt. Saleh already has backed down three times from signing a Gulf initiative for a transfer of power, saying he would only hand over power to 'safe hands.' Lebanon's former prime minister, Saad al-Hariri, said in a statement that Gaddafi's death should be a lesson to leaders who 'have adopted oppression as a method to dominate their people.' 'Any Arab citizen, watching the course of events in Libya, cannot but think of the popular revolutionary movement that is taking place in Syria,' he said. The balance of power shifted dramatically against Gaddafi in March after his troops swept across rebel-held territory and threatened to launch a devastating attack on the eastern rebel stronghold of Benghazi. A U.N. resolution was passed at the time that prompted NATO to launch air strikes. Emad Gad from Egypt's Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies said Gaddafi's death could encourage the international community to be more proactive in other places. He said: 'It will lead to more pressure by the international community to resolve the conflicts in Syria and Yemen. 'It shows that resisting reform will lead to escalating demands from reforms to overthrowing the regime.' Ahmed Montasser, a construction worker watching the news of Gaddafi's death at a café in downtown Cairo, echoed those sentiments. His former president, Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years, is now on trial over the killing of protesters. 'This is the end of every tyrant. The message is that ruling people isn't through force ... It would have been better if he was prosecuted but it was out of the rebels' hands as he was shot dead,' Montasser said.",Syrians inspired by Gaddafi slaying gather in streets in hunt for their leader .

An elected police commissioner will not prioritise low-level drug users because it will take up too much of her officers’ time. Former Labour minister Vera Baird QC, who is in charge of the Northumbria police force, has ignored drug use in her new policing plan. Her office has justified the move on the grounds that combating low-level drug use would mean taking officers off the streets. No prio: Police commissioner Vera Baird said her officers will not focus on low-level drugs as it takes up too much of their time . The plan has led to claims that the . former solicitor general, who is in charge of the force for five years, . is ignoring ‘significant concerns’ among local people. And it flies in the face of the views expressed by Britain’s most senior policeman, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, who earlier this year said he supported ‘robust’ policing of drug use. The Met Commissioner even suggested . that thousands of workers should be routinely tested for illegal . substances as part of measures to reduce demand. At . a meeting of the local police and crime panel, Mrs Baird’s deputy, Mark . Dennett, was asked why the policing plan made no mention of drugs, or . set a drug-dealing reduction target. Revelation: Ms Baird's deputy Mark Dennett, right, defended the policy in front of councillors recently . Ex minister who refused to clean up after her dog . He replied: ‘We did not put drugs in the plan in terms of priorities because that is the best way to use our resources. ‘Drugs . is an issue and will continue to be something we tackle at the highest . level, but the vast majority of our drug seizures are people who are . brought into the station for a different reason and have drugs on them . when we search them. ‘If I put drugs in the plan, there is a danger that beat police officers will not be on the streets in your neighbourhoods.’ But . Newcastle City Council leader Nick Forbes said: ‘We need to maintain a . strong presence on the streets for our police but I am really concerned . about the impact of drugs on our communities and I know there are . significant concerns from residents particularly about the drug use in . parts of the city. ‘It is . important to me that people involved in peddling drugs know that they . will face the full force of the law for their actions.’ A . spokesman at Mrs Baird’s office later claimed: ‘To keep this in . context, drug crime was not mentioned as a priority by the public in any . of the consultation undertaken, including in Newcastle.’ But . the policing plan makes clear that in a public consultation survey, . ‘alcohol and drug-related crimes’ came second among the public in terms . of their concerns, and was mentioned by one in five respondents. And . Mrs Baird herself cited drugs as an issue when criticising council cuts . to youth services last year, warning that ‘drug crime is on the . increase’.

From a roast turkey to a prime beefburger and a moreish Belgian bun, this is a feast that no one could fail to enjoy. Provided you like cake, of course. Every single part of the strikingly realistic-looking array is made from sponge cake, from the turkey's tomato garnish to the glass of Coca-Cola next to the burger. The amazing gateaux were created by Beverly Hills patissier, Rosebud Cakes, which, along with food, also makes cakes in the shape of guitars, dogs and designer bags among others. Realistic: This turkey cake baffled people so successfully that someone tried to break its leg off . Could you tell the difference? Harry Potter's owl, Hedwig, and a burger and chips both made from cake . Breakfast cake: An astonishingly lifelike grapefruit half and a toothsome looking Belgian bun . The company, which has produced . edible artworks for Sean Connery, the Real Housewives and Shaquille . O'Neal among others, was started by Elin Katz over 25 years ago. Katz said: 'People are surprised at how realistic they look. We did a turkey cake for Thanksgiving once and someone pulled the leg off because they thought it was the actual turkey. ""Before I start making them I meet up with the customer to see what their needs are and volley a few ideas back and forth. 'I try to do something special for . them to make them laugh or so that they are deeply touched and make it . as personable as possible.' Katz, who, along with her husband, has been decorating cakes for more than 30 years also revealed that the secret of her success is making sure each piece is as individually interesting as possible. 'I draw a sketch - and we decide the . size, colour scheme, flavours and which bits will be edible. I . just start with a square or circle base and go from there. 'I always try to do something fresh and give people more than just an object.' Bagged it: This cake version of a Chanel 2:55 handbag is strikingly realistic and even comes with perfume . Spectacular: The diamond engagement ring and roses in this box may not be real but they certainly look it . Sandwich: Everything from the lettuce to the bread is crafted by hand from sponge cake . Adorable: This cute pug cake looks so lifelike you almost want to pet it rather than cut a slice . Making the cakes can be a time-consuming business, and getting it right can take as much as three days per cake. 'It usually takes a day to make a complete cake,' she says. 'But some projects have taken three days. I have a team of about four people who perform specific roles in the construction. 'The hardest cake I worked on was one I did recently - a Darth Vader and Storm Trooper. That took three days to make and getting it right was really tough.' Not surprisingly, Katz's edible art doesn't come cheap, with cakes priced between $300 (£200) and $10,000 (£6,650) depending on how intricate the order is. Interestingly, Katz's busiest time of year isn't the wedding season, but Halloween. 'Halloween is my favourite time, it's so much fun. I always have fun doing those cakes,' she reveals. 'It's stressful because you have a . lot to put out in a short amount of time. You always wonder whether the . cake will make it to the party of event.

"By . Paul Scott . PUBLISHED: . 19:20 EST, 15 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:32 EST, 16 February 2013 . Gary Goldsmith and his fourth wife Julie-Ann Brown having lunch near their £1.7million Marlybone house . Like many a would-be author before him, Gary Goldsmith is discovering a multitude of distractions to avoid the taxing business of putting pen to paper. One day this week, for example, Kate Middleton’s black-sheep uncle was to be found enjoying a long and leisurely lunch with friends at the £100-a-head panoramic restaurant at the top of The Gherkin building in London. Other times, he can be spied tucking into his favourite duck egg and chicken livers starter  at the ultra-smart Dean Street Townhouse  in Soho. Whatever the venue, the high-living Goldsmith, who revels in the nickname Gary Goldtaps, likes nothing better than to indulge his taste for fine wine, a favourite being a smooth 1999-vintage Chateau de Sales Pomerol — a snip at £90. In truth, it is hard to imagine that multi-millionaire Goldsmith, the younger brother of Kate’s mother, Carole, is stuck for things to write as he begins the task of penning his juicy memoirs. After all, he could start with his infamous encounter with the News Of The World’s ‘Fake Sheikh’ at 47-year-old Gary’s colourfully named Ibiza home, Maison de Bang Bang, during which Goldsmith was caught on camera snorting cocaine and offering to get the paper’s undercover reporter drugs and Brazilian prostitutes. Or perhaps he could commit to the page his romantic fourth wedding seven months ago to his auburn-haired girlfriend Julie-Ann Brown. The prospect of reading his account of either event is likely, it has to be said, to have sent a chill down the spine of the social-climbing Mrs Middleton as she reclined with her daughter and son-in-law, Prince William, on the Caribbean island of Mustique this week. Neither Carole nor the royal couple were . present when tattooed Gary — who like his sister was raised in a . Middlesex council house — tied the knot in London with 43-year-old Miss . Brown last July. Mr Goldsmith's niece Catherine and William were not at his recent wedding . Mr Goldsmith (left) claims that Julie-Ann Brown (right) is the one for him and that this marriage will succeed where his others didn't . And the new Mrs Goldsmith undoubtedly represents a rather colourful addition to the Middleton clan. She is a convicted fraudster who siphoned off £250,000 from a luxury car firm, where she worked as a clerk, and blew the loot on Rolex watches and Mercedes sports cars. Mr Goldsmith rather sheepishly admitted to me this week: ‘The wedding was a very quiet affair. Carole and Kate were not there. There were just four very close, dear friends. But we are going to celebrate it properly next year with a big bash.’ What’s the betting, though, that Carole and the royal couple — who holidayed with entrepreneur Goldsmith at his Balearic pleasure palace in 2006, but publicly cut ties with him after the embarrassing drug revelations — find they have other plans that day? Carole Middleton and her husband Michael on the day their daughter's engagement was announced. The family cut ties with Mr Goldsmith after the drug scandal . Certainly, the re-emergence of Carole’s troublesome sibling onto the public radar, with his plans for a tell-all book, is something the ambitious Mrs Middleton, 58, could well do without. After all, she and Kate’s father, Michael, who run a lucrative party merchandise firm, have recently moved even further up in the world by splashing out £4.7 million to become lord and lady of a grand manor house in the rolling West Berkshire countryside. And what Carole makes of her new sister-in-law is anyone’s guess. Born in Stockport, Cheshire, Miss Brown — who was also brought up in a council house — bears the blinged-up, perma-tanned look of someone who, after a troubled past, has finally landed on her feet. Over the past two years, Julie-Ann — who favours Chanel handbags, plunging tops, and sports suspiciously inflated breasts and lips — has been a regular fixture at Maison de Bang Bang, which Goldsmith has just put on the market for 6.5 million Euros (£5.6 million). She developed a rather unlikely taste for the finer things in life in the mid-Nineties while earning £11,000 a year in the accounts department of the Stratstone car dealership in Wilmslow, Cheshire. Mr Goldsmith's infamous £5.6million Ibiza holiday home, Maison de Bang Bang . The house has become popular with footballers and those looking to party on the island . Unbeknown to her bosses, she siphoned off cash that she spent on jewellery, including a £12,500 Rolex watch, a £41,000 Mercedes sports car, plus holidays in Barbados and trips to The Ritz in Paris. When her ruse was finally rumbled, she admitted five charges of theft and asked for 52 similar offences to be taken into consideration at her trial at Chester Crown Court in 1996. But she escaped jail and was given a suspended sentence after the judge was told she had endured a troubled and deprived childhood. Clearly, however, her liking for the trappings of money and privilege stuck, and subsequently she has dated a string of rich and successful men, including a self-made communications millionaire called Ray Ingleby, with whom she lived in a property beside London’s Regent’s Park before he was declared bankrupt in August 2010. Mr Goldsmith now says that he would have a 'nosebleed' if he left a W1 postcode . She then moved on to Goldsmith, who made a fortune in 2005 by selling his recruitment firm, Computer Futures, for £275 million. As well as the Ibiza retreat, they also share his £1.7 million mews house in Marylebone. Ominously for Mrs Middleton — and royal courtiers who consider her brother a loose cannon — Goldsmith once more finds himself unemployed and with time to kill after abruptly parting company with IT recruitment company InterQuest last month following less than a year in their employ. Since then, it seems he has returned to the freewheeling, hedonistic lifestyle that got him into so much trouble in 2009 when he fell victim to the now-defunct tabloid’s sting. With that in mind, perhaps, in recent weeks he has been touting himself around firms in the same field in the hope of getting another position. But he denies he’s looking for a job, or that deciding to sell up in Spain has anything to do with strained finances, and insisted to me this week that he is in the market for as big a property in London’s West End. Mr Goldsmith told me: ‘I’m selling Ibiza just because I’m smart with my money. It’s a really good time to be selling something in Euros and buying something in pounds. ‘It’s just me changing my focus and my profile and I’m definitely buying something bigger in London. If I move out of the W1 postcode I get a nosebleed! ‘I parted company with InterQuest on the best possible terms, so we’re all very cool. I’ve had non-executive job offers left, right and centre since then, but I’m catching up with friends at the moment. ‘I’ve not needed to work for a very long time. In fact, for a while, I watched so much Judge Judy [a U.S. courtroom reality show] on daytime TV, I thought I could pass the bar exam. That’s why I wanted to do something with InterQuest and I’m sure I’ll do something again soon. The royals won't be happy to hear about Mr Goldsmith's plan to sell his memoirs . ‘I have a got a few personal projects, but at the moment I’m just chilling out and just having some fun for a bit.’ One of those projects is the writing of his book, for which he has not yet sought a publisher, but which, he assured me this week, will ‘tell the world the whole story’ of his colourful life thus far. However, Goldsmith’s planned revelations, plus, you would think, his choice of wife, threaten to see him banished once more into the cold after the royal couple tentatively invited him back into their fold. Despite his News Of The World humiliation, he was on the guest-list at William and Kate’s wedding in April 2011, to which he turned up in a £280,000 bright blue Rolls-Royce Phantom convertible. But, notably, rather than taking his then new lover, Miss Brown, he arrived with second wife Luan and their daughter, Tallulah, now 11, who is one of Kate’s favourite cousins. He was divorced from wife number three, blonde accountant Julia Leake, 35, just days before the revelations of his drug-taking at Maison de Bang Bang, whose wall bears a 6ft-high mural proclaiming: ‘It’s Gary’s world, you just live in it.’ At the time, Goldsmith was living on the Mediterranean island with a former lapdancer called Antonia. Despite, or possibly because of, the house’s notoriety, it has become popular with Premier League footballers, and Liverpool and England star Jordan Henderson rented it last summer. According to Goldsmith, his recent fourth wedding will be his last: ‘We’re very much in love and this one’s a keeper,’ he told me this week. ‘We have just celebrated six months and it’s all been very cool. It was just the right thing to do. I won’t be having any more kids, though, I’m very happy with my daughter Tallulah, she’s epic.’ No doubt, his big sister Carole might have been hoping that with the imminent sale of his infamous Spanish playground, her problems with bothersome Gary might  be over. But with that tell-all book and colourful new bride, she might just have to think again. Whether Uncle Gary and his fraudster wife will be smiling proudly in the Royal Christening pictures when a new heir to the throne arrives in the summer remains to be seen.","Gary Goldsmith married Julie-Ann Brown, who swindled her bosses out of £250,000 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:37 EST, 27 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:52 EST, 27 October 2012 . Ministers were last night accused of being 'asleep on the job' for failing to act faster to combat a disease that could devastate the nation's woodlands. The new Environment Secretary, Owen Paterson, was asked to explain why he is only now banning imports of ash trees when a fungus that kills them was first found in a British tree nursery in February. Ash die-back, caused by the fungus chalara fraxinea, has wiped out 90 per cent of ash trees in Denmark and is widespread in central Europe. Banning imports: Ash tree imports from Europe will be banned from Monday due to a fungus, which causes leaf loss and crown dieback, which is becoming widespread in Europe . Ash dieback had previously been identified in nurseries and recently planted sites including a car park, a college campus and new woodland, but has now been found in the wider environment at sites in East Anglia, increasing fears it could wreak the same kind of damage as Dutch elm disease in the 1970s. Mr Paterson told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: ‘I will bring in a ban on Monday, having discussed this over the weekend with officials and experts. ‘I have already prepared the legislation and we are ready to go. The evidence is clearly there.’ The president of the Country Land and Business Association, Harry Cotterell, welcomed the import ban but said it may not be enough to stop an epidemic. With chalara fraxinea already present in woods in Norfolk and Suffolk, Britain faces the threat one of the best-loved features of its landscape, he said. Mr Cotterell said: ‘We are very pleased to hear that the ban is going to be announced on Monday. 'National tragedy': Ash trees make up around 30 per cent of the wooded landscape and the fungus has already been discovered in at least 11 woods in Norfolk and Suffolk . ‘I think the real concern is that geographically, it looks like the disease may have arrived into the wild on the wind.’ Asked if the ban would make a difference to the spread of the disease, he said: ‘It may not. It depends on the extent to which we find the disease in the wild throughout the rest of the country. ‘It has already have been discovered in at least 11 woods in Norfolk and Suffolk.’ It was ‘a great pity’ that the discovery of the disease in Britain in spring was not announced at the time. He said: ‘It wouldn’t have made a great deal of difference banning imports in the spring, because most of the imports would have taken place. ‘But we certainly should have been told about it in the spring. Ready to stop them: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is 'ready to go' on the ban which has been blamed for the introduction of the fungus in Britain . ‘It’s a great pity that we weren’t told about it until two or three weeks ago, whereas it clearly had been discovered in nursery stock and young trees in the spring. I think we could have started looking for it - the real concern is to find out the true extent of it.’ ‘If the ash stock in the countryside is devastated, it will be a national tragedy.’ In the UK, ash trees make up around 30 per cent of the wooded landscape, across woodlands, hedgerows and parks. The Woodland Trust has called for an emergency summit or taskforce to be set up by the Government to tackle tree diseases, before another species is lost for good. The Forestry Commission is urging forest managers and tree professionals to use the information on its website about the disease, inspect trees again and report any suspected to be infected. As a precaution, the Commission is suspending the planting of ash trees in public forests it manages. The Horticultural Trades Association has also urged members to abide by a voluntary moratorium on importing ash trees for planting in this country. Mr Paterson said that the import ban would be accompanied by very strict movement restrictions on ash trees already in the country, to prevent the danger of spreading the disease to areas of the country which have not yet been affected. He denied that the Government had acted slowly since the disease was first detected in the UK in February, pointing out that more than 1,000 sites had already been checked and 50,000 trees burnt. Mr Paterson, who was appointed Environment Secretary in David Cameron’s September reshuffle, told Today: ‘The disease was first identified in a nursery in Buckinghamshire on February 24 during a routine inspection. ‘It was then confirmed on March 7 and through the summer a very detailed process has gone on of identifying where the trees have come from and where they have gone. During this process, more than 1,000 sites have been investigated and 50,000 trees have already been burnt. Ash dieback is a serious disease of ash trees caused by a fungus called Chalara fraxinea (C. fraxinea). The disease causes leaf loss and crown dieback in affected trees, as pictured right, and it can lead to tree death. European trees now believed to have been infected with this newly identified pathogen were first reported dying in large numbers in Poland in 1992 and it spread rapidly to other European countries. However, it was 2006 before the fungus’s asexual stage, C. fraxinea, was first described by scientists, and 2010 before its sexual stage, Hymenoscyphus pseudo-albidus, was described. In February 2012 it was found in a consignment of infected trees sent from a nursery in the Netherlands to a nursery in Buckinghamshire. Since then it has been found in a number of locations and situations in England and Scotland, including a car park in Leicester; a Forestry Commission Scotland woodland at Knockmountain, near Kilmacolm, west of Glasgow; a college campus in South Yorkshire; and a property in County Durham. He said: ‘When I came in in September, a consultation with the industry had just started and I made absolutely sure it took as short a time as possible. ‘Over the weekend, I will be talking to experts who will already have prepared, on my instruction, legislation so if the evidence shows it is necessary, and I think it will, we will bring in a ban on Monday morning.’ The chief executive of the Woodland Trust, Sue Holden, said: ‘We are clearly pleased to see Owen Paterson finally taking action to introduce a ban on the import of ash trees in to the UK. ‘We would also urge the Secretary of State to ban the movement of ash around the UK until the extent of ash dieback, and how it is spread, has been determined. ‘We also ask Government scientists to give urgent and clear advice to all woodland owners on how to manage the disease. The Trust will do all it can to mitigate spread in line with this Government instruction and advice. ‘We must stress however, that ash dieback is only one of numerous tree pests and diseases present in the UK. ‘With more than 15 separate pests and diseases listed on the Forestry Commission website as already present, it is crucial that the wider issue is tackled. ‘The Government must set up an emergency summit bringing together representatives from all areas of forestry, plant health and conservation because today it’s ash but tomorrow yet another of our precious native trees could be at risk.’","Environment Secretary to ban ash tree imports on Monday .

A Muslim woman who repeatedly beat a 10-year-old girl with a steel ladle for not reading enough verses of the Koran is facing jail today. Asia Parveen, 31 brandished a knife at the child after accusing her of lying about her prayers. Parveen, who was five months pregnant at the time, also forced the girl to stand with her arms outstretched for four hours, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Asia Parveen, 31 who beat the child with a metal cooking spoon is facing a possible jail sentence . The girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, escaped from the house in Stoke Newington, north London, and police found her alone at a bus stop in Waltham Forest, east London, almost four hours later in the early hours of the morning. Doctors identified 56 injuries when she was examined at hospital, . Parveen, who is a mother-of-three, accepted causing some of the injuries with the ten inch cooking spoon but said others must have been caused when the girl 'fell over.' Prosecutor Tom Nicholson told the court an argument started between Parveen and the girl on August 15 last year during Ramadan. 'The girl was praying from the Koran and Ms Parveen accused her of lying about how many of the verses she had read,' he said. 'She was 10 at the time. Ms Parveen took a metal spoon about 10 inches in size and the Crown's case is that she hit the child with it repeatedly over a half an hour period, causing extensive bruising over both arms, her legs and head. Mother-of-three Asia Parveen outside Snaresbrook Crown Court where she was let out on bail before sentencing . 'The Crown's case is that Ms Parveen said she was going to kill the girl and ran to get a knife from the kitchen. 'The girl had no alternative but to leave at around 10pm. 'She got a bus and a train and it was about 1.50am when the police found her at a bus stop in Broadway Parade, Waltham Forest. 'She was on her own and extremely cold. She was taken to hospital and an examination found she had suffered 56 injuries.' Parveen admitted a single count of child cruelty but insisted that she only used the spoon once or twice on the girl's arms and bottom. She claimed the other injuries had been the result of the girl falling over. Parveen also denied threatening to kill the 10-year-old or picking up a knife. Judge Martyn Zeidman accepted . Parveen's basis of plea, saying it would not be in the public interest . for the child to give evidence. 'The . defendant has accepted she behaved in the wrong way towards the girl . and there is absolutely no doubt that she behaved disgracefully,' the . judge said. 'Before the violence, she says had been asked to stretch her arms up in the air for a period of four hours. 'She says she was hit all over with a spoon on her arms, legs, head and back about 20 times. 'The basis of plea is that the defendant only admits causing injuries to the girl's arms and bottom. 'On the face of it, the defence assertion is incredible. But I don't regard it in the public interest to make the child give evidence. 'In any view, the defendant has behaved in an absolutely disgraceful way, and what an irony that the child was encouraged to behave in a godly fashion when this was far from godly. 'But I undertake to sentence the defendant on her version of events and avoid further distress to the child.' Adjourning the case until June 15 for reports, Judge Zeidman told Parveen: 'I'm releasing you on bail but that gives no indication on what will be the eventual sentence. 'All options are open so you must not assume that because you got bail you will necessarily avoid an immediate prison sentence.' Parveen, of Hackney, north London, will be sentenced on June 15.","Doctors found 56 wounds the child's body .

Stepped down: The headmaster at Stanbridge Earls School in rural Hampshire, Peter Trythall, pictured, which is at the centre of shocking sex abuse claims has today resigned . The headmaster of a controversial school at the centre of shocking sex abuse claims has today resigned. Peter Trythall stepped down from his role at Stanbridge Earls, in Romsey, Hants, 'in the best interests of the school'. It comes as a major police investigation continues into allegations made by two former students, including a vulnerable young girl. The £39,000-a-year school caters for youngsters with learning disabilities. A tribunal ruled earlier this year that the school had discriminated against the pupil, who suffered 'appalling abuse' at the hands of another student. It found a number of staff members failed to tell the youngster’s parents that she had complained of pain in an intimate part of her body. And it said the school had been 'unsystematic, unprofessional, ad hoc and completely inadequate' when it came to protecting her. Mr Trythall was accused of 'a failure of responsibility'. Furthermore, the Nursing and Midwifery Council confirmed school nurse Melanie Bavington was under investigation. The governors today said: 'The Governors of Stanbridge Earls School have today accepted the resignation of headmaster Peter Trythall. 'We acknowledge the difficulties he has faced during these last few months, and respect his decision which he has taken in the best interests of the school. 'They are indebted to him for the many things that he has achieved during his tenure of office. 'The day to day management of the school will be in the hands of the two deputies, supported by a specialist SEN Consultant in Leadership and Management, and under the guidance of the Chairman of Governors. Controversy: Mr Trythall stepped down from his role at Stanbridge Earls, in Romsey, Hampshire, pictured, 'in the best interests of the school' 'That will be until such time as an interim head can be appointed.' The Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal later ordered the school pay the girl’s family £86,000 for legal costs. She cannot be named for legal reasons. Detectives from Hampshire Constabulary’s public protection department are examining whether 'further criminal offences' have been committed against other youngsters attending the school. Both the chairman of the board of governors Tony Knight and a second governor Claire Marsden have already resigned. The school has vowed to make urgent improvements and to work with outside agencies.","Peter Trythall stepped down from his role at Stanbridge Earls in Hampshire .

The jurors who found Dr Kermit Gosnell guilty of killing three babies at his grimy abortion clinic have revealed they believe he was motivated by greed as he intentionally killed the newborns. Speaking publicly for the first time since the verdict was reached on Monday following a two-month trial, three jurors spoke about why they agreed to convict him on three murder charges. Their press conference came after he was handed a third life sentence on Wednesday. He was also sentenced to up to five years for the involuntary manslaughter death of Karnamaya Mongar, 41, who died from a drug overdose after going to him for an abortion. One juror, David Misko, 27, said they had agreed to convict him because they believe the murders - which were carried out when Gosnell snipped the babies' necks with scissors - were premeditated. Speaking out: Jurors (from left) David Misko, Joseph Carroll and Sarah Glinski speak to the media outside the criminal justice center in Philadelphia days after they found Dr Kermit Gosnell guilty . 'It was business as usual,' Misko said. 'He snipped the necks no matter what happened.' Misko added that he judged Gosnell for not speaking in the trial: 'He just sat there and smirked for eight weeks,' he said. Another juror, Joseph Carroll, added that most the group also felt that the doctor had been driven by greed rather than compassion for the mothers or their babies. 'The services... it was like a machine,' he told reporters outside the justice center in Philadelphia. 'They came in, he gave them a service, and bam, the women were gone.' Juror Sarah Glinski added that the hardest part of the trial was having to see the images of the lifeless children. Decision makers: Misko, left, said they agreed the killings had been premeditated and would go ahead whether the babies were big enough to live or not. Carroll, right, said Gosnell was driven by greed . Disturbed: Glinski said she thinks Gosnell started with good intentions then 'something went wrong' Media scrum: It is the first time the jurors have spoken out in the trial, which started two months ago . 'Seeing those photos and just having to say to myself, ""This did happen to those kids. There were children that died at the hands of this man."" That was what was hard for me. To admit that that kind of evil exists in this world,' she said. But she added that she did not believe the doctor started out with the same intentions when he began carrying out abortions for low-income women years ago. 'He was an abortion doctor who tried to help people who didn't have the money,' she said. 'I think somewhere, something, went wrong in his mind.' Carroll said they also talked about whether the mothers were to blame and he said that he believed some should have been charged because their babies were past the legal threshold. Gosnell was spared the death penalty on Tuesday after striking a plea deal; he will serve his life sentences consecutively and without parole after giving up his right to appeal. Convicted: Gosnell is pictured leaving the Criminal Justice Center after he was found guilty on Monday . Frightening: The jurors said they thought that Gosnell had smirked throughout his murder trial . Gosnell was pictured smiling as . he was led from the court on Monday. The jury found he was guilty of murder in the deaths of babies, who had been named A, C and D for the purpose of the trial. In . earlier testimony, the court heard how a clinic employee had . photographed Baby A after Dr Gosnell had joked: 'He's big enough to walk . you to the bus stop.' Clinic . workers also testified that they had seen Baby C, a little girl, move . her arm before her neck was snipped, bringing about her death. And . Baby D was born in the clinic's bathroom and was seen struggling to get . out of the toilet before a worker also snipped their spine. He was found not guilty in the death of Baby E, who workers had said let out a single cry before the neck was snipped. Dr Gosnell's attorney Jack McMahon said they were 'disappointed' with the verdict. In court: A sketch shows Gosnell during his sentencing at Philadelphia Common Pleas Court . Defense: Gosnell's lawyer Jack McMahon speaks following the verdict, which he called 'disappointing' 'We put on a vigorous defense,' he told CNN. 'We think it went well in the courtroom... but we respect the jury's verdict. 'Obviously . the jury took their job very seriously... By the nature of the verdict - . both guilty and not guilty verdicts - they obviously thought about the . evidence. They were conscientious.' The jury heard five weeks of testimony before breaking for deliberation on April 30. As prosecutors gave their closing . arguments in Gosnell's trial two weeks ago, Assistant District Attorney . Ed Cameron turned to Gosnell and asked 'Are you human?' - but the . doctor simply laughed. 'My dog was treated better than those babies and women,' Cameron said. He added that Mongar's death was the result of Gosnell's 'assembly line' treatment of patients. The defense questioned testimony from . staffers who said they had seen babies move, cry or breathe, claiming . that the babies had died from abortion-inducing drugs rather than . severed spines. Tragic: He was found guilty of manslaughter in the death of Karnamaya Mongar, who died after an abortion . Scene: A police car is seen outside the the Women's Medical Society in 2011 following Gosnell's arrest . After weeks of hearing from former employees, Gosnell did not testify, and his lawyer, John McMahon, called no witnesses in his defense. He said that the doctor had simply provided . desperate, often poor woman with a solution, and he branded . prosecutors 'racist' for attacking Gosnell, who is . black and whose patients were largely minorities. McMahon argued that each worker had testified to seeing only a single movement or breath. 'These . are not the movements of a live child,' McMahon said. 'There is not one . piece - not one - of objective, scientific evidence that anyone was . born alive.' But the prosecutor questioned why . else Gosnell and his staff would 'snip' babies if they were not born . alive. The brains were intact, so it was not done to make the delivery . easier, he said. Gosnell's grisly business was . discovered more than two years ago when authorities went to investigate . prescription drug trafficking at Gosnell's clinic in a low-income area . of West Philadelphia. Painful: Desiree Hawkins, a former patient of Dr Kermit Gosnell, recounts her ordeal at his abortion clinic. She said detectives called her three years later to reveal her baby's foot was found in a fridge . Nowhere to turn: Davida Clarke said she went to the clinic after she was raped when she was younger . Instead, they came across blood-splattered operating tables, bags of body parts, unsanitary instruments, jars of severed feet and the stink of cat urine, according to a 2011 grand jury report. The . tiny fetuses and many of their bodyparts were piled high throughout . Gosnell’s clinic in cabinets and freezers, in plastic bags, bottles, . even cat-food containers. The report added that dozens of women were injured at . Gosnell's clinic over the past 30 years, calling it a 'house of . horrors'. Some . left with torn wombs or bowels, some with venereal disease contracted . through the reuse of non-sterilized equipment, and some left with fetal . remains still inside them, the report alleged. Employees . at the clinic confirmed that babies were often expelled from their . mothers into the toilet. On at least one occasion the toilet had to be . removed from the floor to 'get the fetuses out of the pipes.' Discarded: Bags stashed with body parts, pictured, were also found in the Philadelphia clinic . Operating table: Women were often given such high doses of drugs that they gave birth in the toilet . Former . staffers added that patients received heavy sedatives and . painkillers from untrained workers while Gosnell was offsite, and were . then left in waiting rooms for hours, often unattended. Gosnell . has been in jail since his January 2011 arrest. The business apparently made Gosnell a fortune over the 30 years he was carrying out abortions. Authorities said that the medical practice netted him about $1.8 million a year, and found $250,000 hidden in a bedroom when they searched one of his numerous properties. Eight other defendants . have pleaded guilty to a variety of charges and are awaiting sentencing.

An investment group is selling the 10-bedroom oceanfront home in Coronado, near San Diego, that was once owned by Shacknai, the CEO and founder of Arizona-based Medicis Pharmaceutical Corp. Realtors assure that the 12,750 sq. ft. house, known as Spreckels Mansion, has been stripped of its tragic history after undergoing extensive renovations and said they expect a lot of interest. In July 2011, Shacknai's girlfriend Rebecca Zahau was found bound and hanging from the mansion's balcony two days after Shacknai's son Max was fatally injured after falling down the stairs. House of horrors: A mansion owned by millionaire Jonah Shacknai - where his son sustained fatal injuries in a fall three days before his girlfriend was found hanged there - is going on sale for $16.9 million . A look inside: These are the first photographs from inside the newly-renovated house since the deaths . Lavish: The Spreckels mansion is a landmark in one of San Diego's most exclusive neighborhoods . Investigators called Max's death an . accident and Zahau's a suicide, but Max's mother and Zahau's family have . both called the deaths suspicious. Scott Aurich, of Pacific Sotheby’s International Realty, said the home has received a top-to-bottom renovation, but no changes have been made to the balcony where Zahau was found. He said that he does not believe prospective buyers will not be put off by its grisly history. 'The people looking to buy this house . think of it as what they can use it for, and how it fits their needs - . and the location and the opportunity that's here because it's a . one-of-a-kind asset,' he told San Diego 6. History: Six-year-old Max fell over the balcony of this staircase and died from his injuries . Fall: The entrance of the home, near to where Max was found at the bottom of the staircase . New look: But realtors say prospective buyers will not be put off by the history as the home has undergone extensive renovations, such as in the master bedroom, which was originally two bedrooms . Stunning: The ocean-side home near San Diego has ten bedroom and nine-and-a-half bathrooms . The renovations were carried out . after Shacknai entered into a deal with a group of investors, but Aurich . would not disclose the nature of the deal or the people involved. The updates include a new roof, refurbished wood flooring and improvements to several rooms, including the master bedroom and the kitchen. There is also a new pool and jacuzzi between the main . house and the guest house, where Shacknai's brother was staying when he . found Zahau's body. Shacknai bought the 10-bedroom, nine-and-a-half bathroom home for $12.75 million in March 2007. The listing describes the property as 'one of the premier oceanfront beach . compounds in all of Southern California... overlooking one of the most beautiful beaches in the world!' The home gets its name from John D. Spreckels, a sugar baron who was once the wealthiest man in San Diego and who financed the home in 1901. Expensive: The property, which was built in 1091, was bought by a group of investors last year . A steal: Realtors said the property was a bargain as the land itself is nearly worth as much as the asking price . Addition: A swimming pool and jacuzzi have been added between the house and guest house - where Shacknai's brother was staying when he found the body of Rebecca in July 2011 . Lavish: The oceanfront, historic home near San Diego has 10 bedrooms and 9-and-a-half bathrooms . The mansion hit headlines two years ago for the deaths, which have been deemed suspicious by family members of the deceased. Max .

They reported that her son's death was not an accident. 'He . was a victim of assault and a victim of homicide,' Dina Shacknai told . NBC News last August. 'Even though nothing will bring my only child . Maxie back, I owe it to him, as his mother, to make sure the true facts . of his death are known.' The official police investigation into the death of Max found that the boy tumbled over a railing and fell down the stairs. The . little boy is said to have hit the carpeted floor face first which . fractured his forehead and when paramedics arrived he was not breathing . and did not have a pulse.

Loss: Zahau was dating millionaire businessman Jonah Shacknai (pictured together), who owned the home . Questions: Max's mother, Dina Shacknai, hired investigators who said he had been assaulted and killed . He died one week later at Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego. Max Shacknai was in the care of his father's girlfriend Rebecca Zahau at the time of his death, but her family members said it was 'preposterous' she would be involved in his death. Zahau was found by Jonah Shacknai hanging from an outside balcony at the home days after Max's tragic fall. She was naked, gagged and her hands and feet bound.

We are filled with many emotions as we look to the future, but the most important one is hope. We are very grateful to you all for your amazing support.' The message has already received more than 2,000 'likes'. Leo and Lulu, whose full name was Lucia, were murdered at the family's Upper West Side home on October 26 in an horrific crime that shocked the country. Mrs Krim arrived home at the family apartment to find two of her two children dead in the bath-tub next to nanny Yoselyn Ortega who had slit her own throat in an alleged suicide attempt. Loss: Two-year-old Leo and his big sister Lulu, six, were found in a pool of blood in the family's home . Victims: Only Nessie, whose picture has been pixelated, escaped harm as she was with her mother . Nessie escaped injury as she was with her mother at the time. In January, Mr Krim, an executive at America's CNBC television station, said that they are drawing strength from their remaining child. He said: 'Marina and I couldn't be more proud of her - she is very smart, beautiful and tough. And she's grown so much over the past two months. She saves us every day.' In April, the Krim's nanny Yoseyln Ortega, 50, was . ruled fit to stand trial and will now face a jury for two counts of . first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder. Cause for celebration: The Krims shared the happy news on a Facebook page set up for the children . She has pleaded not guilty to the charges. When questioned by police after awaking from the coma, the nanny attempted to paint Mrs Krim in a bad light, shifting part of the blame for the tragedy on her. Ortega, who had told neighbors and family that she was short of money, revealed she resented her employers because they kept telling her what to do and asked her to do the housework, it was reported after the murders.

Dr Kermit Gosnell, the late-term abortionist found guilty on Monday of murdering three babies who were born alive in his dirty clinic, has been spared the death penalty after striking a plea deal. The doctor, who killed the newborns by snipping their necks with scissors at  the now-shuttered Women's Medical Society Clinic in West Philadelphia, will serve two consecutive life sentences without parole after giving up his right to appeal. Gosnell will be sentenced on Wednesday in the death of the third baby, as well as for the involuntary manslaughter conviction after a patient died at the clinic following a drug overdose. He will also be sentenced for hundreds of lesser counts of violating the state's 'informed . consent' law, which says there must be a 24-hour waiting period before . an abortion. Scroll down for video . Lock down: Dr Kermit Gosnell, 72, is escorted to a van leaving the Criminal Justice Center on Monday after being convicted on three counts of first-degree murder on Monday in Philadelphia . Facing the death penalty: The late-term abortionist shook his head as the guilty verdict came in at the Philadelphia court . Prosecutors had sought the death penalty as Gosnell killed more than one person, and his victims were especially vulnerable given their age. But Gosnell's own age - 72 - made it unlikely he would ever be executed before his appeals ran out. His attorney Jack McMahon said before the sentencing deal that his client's bid for acquittal had been a losing battle. 'The media has been overwhelmingly against him,' McMahon said. 'But I think the jury listened to the evidence... and they found what they found.' Gosnell was pictured smiling as . he was led from the court on Monday. He had been charged with four . counts of capital murder, but was found not-guilty on one charge. The disgraced doctor was also found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the death of . Karnamaya Mongar, 41, a refugee who died after a drug overdose following an abortion in November 2010. Lock down: It took a jury in Pennsylvania just ten days to find the killer doctor guilty . The jury found he was guilty of murder in the deaths of babies, who had been named A, C and D for the purpose of the trial. In . earlier testimony, the court heard how a clinic employee had . photographed Baby A after Dr Gosnell had joked: 'He's big enough to walk . you to the bus stop.' Clinic . workers also testified that they had seen Baby C, a little girl, move . her arm before her neck was snipped, bringing about her death. And . Baby D was born in the clinic's bathroom and was seen struggling to get . out of the toilet before a worker also snipped their spine. He was found not guilty in the death of Baby E, who workers had said let out a single cry before the neck was snipped. Dr Gosnell's attorney Jack McMahon said they were 'disappointed' with the verdict. Defense: Gosnell's lawyer Jack McMahon speaks following the verdict, which he called 'disappointing' Tragic: He was found guilty of manslaughter in the death of Karnamaya Mongar, who died after an abortion . 'We put on a vigorous defense,' he told CNN. 'We think it went well in the courtroom... but we respect the jury's verdict. 'Obviously the jury took their job very seriously... By the nature of the verdict - both guilty and not guilty verdicts - they obviously thought about the evidence. They were conscientious.' He added that it was too early to say if he would appeal, and would not comment on whether he thought his client would get the death penalty or whether he would be speaking during the penalty phase, which begins on Tuesday next week. Scene: A police car is seen outside the the Women's Medical Society in 2011 following Gosnell's arrest . Discarded: Bags stashed with body parts, pictured, were also found in the Philadelphia clinic . 'House of horrors' doctor Kermit Gosnell built up a multimillion dollar property empire from the pain and suffering he inflicted carrying out thousands of illegal abortions. With annual earnings of more than $1.8m according to prosecutors, the 72-year-old 'baby killer' invested his money in a series of properties that included an ocean front home and 18ft sailing boat. MailOnline has discovered Gosnell, who faces the death penalty after being found guilty in three out of four murder charges today after cutting the spinal cords of babies during late term abortions, owned at least nine properties in four states. They included a $900,000 townhouse in Philadelphia, a $800,000 home overlooking the ocean in New Jersey and several condos. Investigators are looking to see if he owns further properties, including any abroad, after he refused to respond to a court order telling him to reveal all his assets. The IRS is interested in the rogue doctor after prosecutors said Gosnell was mostly paid in cash. When his home was raided they found $240,000 in bundles. Gosnell's assets are estimated to be worth several million dollars and all paid for from the 15 abortions a day he carried out for the past 30 years. Paul Thompson . The verdict was reached just hours after . the seven-woman, five-man jury - which had been deliberating for 10 . days - sent out a handwritten note to say it was hung on two counts. But after the jury delivered their note, the judge told them they had to agree on the verdict and were sent back to deliberate. The jury heard five weeks of testimony before breaking for deliberation on April 30. As prosecutors gave their closing . arguments in Gosnell's trial two weeks ago, Assistant District Attorney . Ed Cameron turned to Gosnell and asked 'Are you human?' - but the . doctor simply laughed. 'My dog was treated better than those babies and women,' Cameron said. He added that Mongar's death was the result of Gosnell's 'assembly line' treatment of patients. The defense questioned testimony from . staffers who said they had seen babies move, cry or breathe, claiming . that the babies had died from abortion-inducing drugs rather than . severed spines. After weeks of hearing from former employees, Gosnell did not testify, and his lawyer, John McMahon, called no witnesses in his defense. He said that the doctor had simply provided . desperate, often poor woman with a solution, and he branded . prosecutors 'racist' for attacking Gosnell, who is . black and whose patients were largely minorities. McMahon argued that each worker had testified to seeing only a single movement or breath. 'These . are not the movements of a live child,' McMahon said. 'There is not one . piece - not one - of objective, scientific evidence that anyone was . born alive.' Painful: Desiree Hawkins, a former patient of Dr Kermit Gosnell, recounts her ordeal at his abortion clinic. She said detectives called her three years later to reveal her baby's foot was found in a fridge . Nowhere to turn: Davida Clarke said she went to the clinic after she was raped when she was younger . But the prosecutor questioned why . else Gosnell and his staff would 'snip' babies if they were not born . alive. The brains were intact, so it was not done to make the delivery . easier, he said. Gosnell's grisly business was . discovered more than two years ago when authorities went to investigate . prescription drug trafficking at Gosnell's clinic in a low-income area . of West Philadelphia. Instead, they came across blood-splattered operating tables, bags of body parts, unsanitary instruments, jars of severed feet and the stink of cat urine, according to a 2011 grand jury report. The . tiny fetuses and many of their bodyparts were piled high throughout . Gosnell’s clinic in cabinets and freezers, in plastic bags, bottles, . even cat-food containers. The report added that dozens of women were injured at . Gosnell's clinic over the past 30 years, calling it a 'house of . horrors'. Some . left with torn wombs or bowels, some with venereal disease contracted . through the reuse of non-sterilized equipment, and some left with fetal . remains still inside them, the report alleged. Operating table: Women were often given such high doses of drugs that they gave birth in the toilet . No escape: Mongar allegedly died after staff had been unable to open this side door for an hour . Employees . at the clinic confirmed that babies were often expelled from their . mothers into the toilet. On at least one occasion the toilet had to be . removed from the floor to 'get the fetuses out of the pipes.' Former . staffers added that patients received heavy sedatives and . painkillers from untrained workers while Gosnell was offsite, and were . then left in waiting rooms for hours, often unattended. Gosnell . has been in jail since his January 2011 arrest. The business apparently made Gosnell a fortune over the 30 years he was carrying out abortions. Authorities said that the medical practice netted him about $1.8 million a year, and found $250,000 hidden in a bedroom when they searched one of his numerous properties. Eight other defendants . have pleaded guilty to a variety of charges and are awaiting sentencing.

'Killer': Andrew Welden, 28, 'tricked his pregnant girlfriend into taking an abortion-induing drug' The son of a fertility doctor has been accused of tricking his pregnant girlfriend into taking an abortion pill and killing their unborn child. John Andrew Welden, 28, faces a first-degree murder charge and a life in prison for allegedly giving the woman a bottle of abortion-inducing drugs, which he told her were harmless antibiotics. His now ex-girlfriend, Remee Lee, was six weeks pregnant when a scan at Welden's father's clinic in Lutz, Florida confirmed that she was pregnant - but she said Welden was not happy with the news. 'I was never going to do anything but go full term with it, and he didn't want me to,' Lee, 26, told ABC Action News. But after the scan, Welden, who is working towards a degree in sports medicine, called her to say that she had a bacterial infection and needed to take Amoxycillin, an antibiotic, three times a day. He gave her a bottle of pills, which she called 'his weapon of choice'. Lee told ABC Action News that she did not call Dr . Welden to confirm that she had an infection because she trusted her . boyfriend and believed they had a future together. Accused: Welden, pictured with his ex-girlfriend Remee Lee, allegedly told her the pills were antibiotics . Heartbroken: Ms Lee said she really wanted the child, but that Welden was not happy about it . In fact, Andrew Welden had forged the doctor's signature on a prescription for Cytotec - an abortion-inducing drug - and re-labeled the bottle as Amoxycillin, according to a federal prosecutor. Lee took a pill on her way to work but was hospitalized with bleeding and abdominal pains, the Tampa Bay Times reported. She lost the baby in hospital. 'Weapon of choice': Welden allegedly gave her this bottle of pills after switching the labels . She was carrying the bottle of pills and doctors saw that they were not antibiotics. 'What did you give me, Andrew?' she asked Welden, according to the prosecutor. Welden admitted the switch in a . confession recorded by Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office detectives, . the prosecutor said. A drugstore surveillance camera captured him buying . Cytotec, the Times reported. Lee filed a lawsuit in state court on Wednesday claiming she suffered battery and emotional distress, while the government has begun its criminal case in federal court. A federal grand jury indicted him on Tuesday with product tampering and first-degree murder. In federal court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Muldrow called the terminated pregnancy 'senseless', the Times reported. 'He had no reason to kill the baby, his baby,' Muldrow said. 'She had a name for the baby she wanted to have.' The paper noted that while a six-week-old fetus would not be considered viable in state court, federal law does not acknowledge the distinction. If someone kills an unborn child while committing a federal crime, it is considered murder, Tampa lawyer Todd Foster, a former assistant U.S. Attorney and FBI agent, said. Loss: The fetus, pictured, was six weeks old when it died and now Welden faces a murder charge . Welden was denied bail after he was deemed a flight risk, but his defense attorney David Weisbrod said Welden had no prior criminal record and said the act was out of character for his client. Welden's father, a board certified . obstetrician and gynecologist who works with infertile couples wishing . to become pregnant, has not been accused of any crime. Andrew Welden worked as an office manager at the Lutz office of Premiere Weight Loss Center, another family business. His bio on its website says that he studied nutrition and exercise physiology at the University of Mississippi and the University of Memphis, and is working toward a degree in sports medicine.

Jodi Arias has been transferred back to a Phoenix jail after spending the weekend on suicide watch at another facility. Maricopa County Sheriff's officials say Arias is back at the Estrella Jail where she will be housed until her trial has concluded. Arias was convicted of first-degree murder on Wednesday in the June 2008 killing of her one-time boyfriend. She claimed she killed Travis Alexander in self-defense after he attacked her, but authorities said it was a planned murder fueled by jealousy. She returns to court Wednesday as jurors determine whether the death penalty should be an option for sentencing. Arias could also face life in prison. Scroll down for video . Psych ward: Jodi Arias is reportedly on suicide watch after talking about how she wants to die . Authorities say she is held alone in a cell and allowed out for one hour each day for phone calls and showers. Court officials did not formally . announce that their concerns over her mental state were the reason for . the delay, but it was revealed that they felt it was necessary because . of her comments in an interview immediately after her guilty verdict was . handed down. Speaking to the local Fox affiliate KSAZ, Arias said that she would 'prefer to die sooner than later.' ‘Longevity runs in my family, and I don't want to spend the rest of my natural life in one place. I'm pretty healthy, I don't smoke and I'll probably live for a long time so that's not something that I am looking forward to. 'I believe death is the ultimate freedom and I'd rather have my freedom as soon as I can get it.' The jury was originally scheduled to return to the courtroom on Thursday afternoon to decide whether Arias will receive the death penalty or if she will be sentenced to upwards of 25 years behind bars for the murder of her on-again off-again boyfriend Travis Alexander on June 4, 2008. The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office . said it put Arias on suicide watch following her statements to MyFoxPhoenix, which came just minutes after she was found guilty of first-degree murder. Taking precautions: The Maricopa County Sheriff's office are trying to keep the murderer from harming herself as she awaits the next portion of her sentencing process . 'At the conclusion of this interview and . in light of some of her statements during the interview, Arias was . brought to jail and... was placed . on suicide protocol,' a statement from the sheriff's office read. 'Until . she is released from suicide protocol by Sheriff’s officials, no . further media interviews of inmate Arias will be permitted.' Arias’ public decree that she prefers a death sentence will not necessarily influence the final verdict. She can decide whether or not she wants to testify and plead for her life, and from there, they have to also have to consider the severity and aggressive nature of the crime. If the jury finds that it was sufficiently heinous- which in legal terms is called the discovery that aggravation exists- they will move on to the penalty phase and suggest that she either spends life behind bars or death. Speaking out: Jodi Arias gave an interview to a local news station just minutes after the verdict and she said that she hopes she gets the death penalty because she doesn't want to 'spend the rest of my natural life in one place' The jury agreed with prosecutors that . she had plotted to kill Travis Alexander, a Mormon motivational speaker . and salesman, who was found stabbed, shot and nearly decapitated in his . shower in 2008. In the interview, she said that she was shocked by the outcome and hoped to get the death penalty. 'The worst outcome would be natural life because longevity runs in my family,' she said. 'The worst outcome would be natural . life. 'I would much rather die sooner rather than later because longevity . runs in my family, and I don't want to spend the rest of my natural . life in one place. I'm pretty healthy, I don't smoke and I'll probably . live for a long time so that's not something that I am looking forward . to. Guilty! Jody Arias, 32, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of her ex, Travis Alexander . Insistence: Arias, 32, had claimed that she killed Alexander in self defense after she attacked him . The interview took place in a holding . room inside the courthouse just 20 minutes after the guilty verdict was . rendered, sparking cheers among the crowd swarming the outside of the . court. Since she admitted that she killed Alexander, there was no chance that she would have been found innocent, but the question of whether or not she planned the murder or whether it was committed as an act of self defense. On Wednesday, five members of the 12-person jury found it was premeditated and the seven others found that it was both premeditated and a felony murder. 'It was unexpected for me yes because . there was no premeditation on my part,' she said. 'The . whole time I was fairly confident that I wouldn't get premeditation . because there was no premeditation.' Killed: Alexander's body was found repeatedly stabbed and shot in his shower in June 2008 . She said that she would have . understood if they simply found her guilty of felony murder 'because of . the way that the law is written' but also attributes some of her own . actions that caused the jury not to believe her. 'I can understand that because of the lies I told in the beginning, to try to cover this and hide that,' Arias said calmly. She took shots at prosecutor Juan Martinez, who she sparred with for weeks during her questioning. 'Prior . to trial, I respected Juan as a capable attorney even though he's done . some very shady things in my case as far as hiding evidence,' she said. 'In the end, what does it matter - it doesn’t help my case.' Spectacle: Court officials told the public that the verdict was going to be read three hours before it actually happened, giving followers time to gather outside of the Maricopa Courthouse . Victory: Crowds cheer when they heard Jodi Arias was convicted of first degree murder Wednesday afternoon . Invested: Three women break down outside the court following the guilty verdict on Wednesday . Arias said that she was 'overwhelmed' and 'went blank' following the verdict, even though she showed little emotion and simply looked back at the spectators. Some of the hundreds of Alexander . supporters who gathered outside of the courtroom awaiting the verdict . held posters praising Martinez, one even suggesting he runs for governor . of Arizona. In the interview, she . did not apologize to the Alexander family, saying only that 'now that a . verdict has been rendered that they can find peace, or some semblance . of peace.' When asked what she would do if she were to go back to the moment when she was standing by her car in the desert with her hands covered in Alexander's blood, she said that she would drive directly to the Mesa, Arizona police department. Blame: Arias accused prosecutor Juan Martinez of lying in the case, while others praised him for his approach . In the courtroom, she repeatedly said that she did not know what she would have done. Though she has been separated from her original pod of cellmates, Arias said that she got a sense of how big the trial was getting when new inmates would enter the prison and seek her out. 'They want to shake my hand, they want to give me a hug. They want my autograph - I'm not going to sign anything,' she said.

Today Daniel Stani-Reginald, now 21, was sentenced 45 years in jail for killing Tosha Thakkar, 24, in Sydney.

Chilling: Daniel Stani-Reginald, who raped and strangled his neighbour Tosha Thakkar, 24, calmly carries her body out of the building in a suitcase before dumping it in a canal . Sentencing him to a maximum 45 year jail term on Friday, Justice Derek Price said Stani-Reginald had shown no capacity for empathy or any remorse for the cruel and premeditated crime. 'There is documented evidence he had been planning similar offences for a period of years, gradually becoming more focused,' Justice Price said as he set a non-parole period of 30 years. 'Notwithstanding her efforts to survive, the offender strangled her, which was extremely cruel,' Justice Price said. 'The last minutes of her life must have been horrifying. This was a terrible way for the deceased to die.' Jailed: Today Daniel Stani-Reginald, now 21, was sentenced 45 years in jail for killing Tosha Thakkar, 24, in Sydney . In the weeks leading up to the 2011 murder, Stani-Reginald had visited 9,500 online articles and websites dedicated to serial killers and rapists. Stani-Reginald has pleaded guilty to raping and strangling the accountancy student, and is due to be sentenced by Sydney Supreme Court. Crown prosecutor Mark Tedeschi QC today urged a judge to impose a life sentence on Stani-Reginald, saying he is capable of seeking notoriety as a serial killer, NineNewsNational reports. Instead of attending university or forging a career, Stani-Reginald 'made a deliberate decision to school himself on how to become a serial rapist and murderer,' Mr Tedeschi said. Miss Thakkar, originally from Gujarat, had moved to Australia two years earlier to take a post-graduate in accounting at the city's Southern Cross University. The brutal killing took place in the home of Ms Thakkar, who lived in the same house as Stani-Reginald in the Sydney suburb of Croydon, on March 9, 2011. Stani-Reginald had spent the morning 'studying' the sentences of serial killers and watching pornography focusing on the 'degradation of Indian women,' the court heard. Macabre education: In the months leading up to the 2011 murder of Miss Thakkar, Daniel Stani-Reginald, then 19, visited thousands of websites dedicated to serial killers and rapists . Brutal killing: Stani-Reginald, now 21, attacked accountancy student Miss Thakkar, stuffed her dismembered body into a suitcase and dumped it in a canal before he went home to read 'Beginnings of a Serial Killer' After the murder, Stani-Reginald jumped in a cab and transported Miss Thakkar's dismembered body, which he had put in a suitcase, to a canal at Meadowbank, Sydney where it was found two days later. After dumping the body, he visited a shopping centre before returning home to continue his morbid studies and even spoke to Miss Thakkar's boyfriend as police investigated her disappearance. Stani-Reginald was not found to have been under any influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the murder and has not shown remorse, Mr Tedeschi said, . 'There's not the slightest suggestion he was horrified by what he had done. The community would be justifiably aggrieved if he were to receive a sentence less than life imprisonment,"" Mr Tedeschi said. The sentence hearing continues.","Daniel Stani-Reginald, now 21, raped and killed Tosha Thakkar, 24, in 2011 .

A pregnant woman who lost her baby after her boyfriend allegedly tricked her into taking an abortion-inducing drug feared for her safety and sought the court's protection in the days after the killing. Remee Lee, 26, was rushed to hospital with bleeding after John Andrew Welden - her boyfriend and the son of a fertility doctor - allegedly gave her a bottle of pills which he claimed were antibiotics. After she took a pill, her seven-week-old fetus died and three days later, Lee sought protection against Welden, 28, in Hillsborough Circuit Court, near their homes in Lutz, Florida. In her April 1 petition, she listed his weapons as 'guns, knives, brass knuckles' and 'medicine', the Tampa Bay Times reported. Happier time: Andrew Welden, pictured with his ex-girlfriend Remee Lee, allegedly gave her pills and claimed they were antibiotics. But hours later, she was rushed to hospital and lost the baby . 'I am afraid that he took measures to kill/abort/murder my unborn child, potentially killing me by switching my medicine,' she wrote. 'And now that he is facing investigation he will continue to cause me more emotional and physical harm.' In one section of the petition, she was asked whether she had a child with the man - and unable to provide a definitive answer in the light of the tragedy, she simply ticked 'n/a'. Welden faces a first-degree murder charge and a life in prison for the alleged killing. Lee was around six weeks pregnant when a scan at Welden's father's clinic in Lutz, Florida confirmed that she was pregnant - but she said Welden was not happy with the news. Fears: In the hours after the death, Lee, left, sought the court's protection against Welden, right . Loss: The fetus, pictured, was six weeks old when it died and now Welden faces a murder charge . 'I was never going to do anything but go full term with it, and he didn't want me to,' Lee, 26, told ABC Action News. But after the scan, Welden, who is working towards a degree in sports medicine, called her to say that she had a bacterial infection and needed to take Amoxycillin, an antibiotic, three times a day. He gave her a bottle of pills, which she called 'his weapon of choice'. Lee told ABC Action News that she did not call Dr . Welden to confirm that she had an infection because she trusted her . boyfriend and believed they had a future together. In fact, Andrew Welden had forged his father's signature on a prescription for Cytotec - an abortion-inducing drug - and re-labeled the bottle as Amoxycillin, according to a federal prosecutor. At work: His father, Dr. Stephen Weldon, has not been accused of any crime in the death of the child . Lee took a pill on her way to work but was hospitalized with bleeding and abdominal pains, the Tampa Bay Times reported. She lost the baby in hospital. 'Weapon of choice': Welden allegedly gave her this bottle of pills after switching the labels . She was carrying the bottle of pills and doctors saw that they were not antibiotics. 'What did you give me, Andrew?' she asked Welden, according to the prosecutor. Welden admitted the switch in a . confession recorded by Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office detectives, . the prosecutor said. A drugstore surveillance camera captured him buying . Cytotec, the Times reported. Lee filed a lawsuit in state court on Wednesday claiming she suffered battery and emotional distress, while the government has begun its criminal case in federal court. A federal grand jury indicted him on Tuesday with product tampering and first-degree murder. In federal court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Muldrow called the terminated pregnancy 'senseless', the Times reported. 'He had no reason to kill the baby, his baby,' Muldrow said. 'She had a name for the baby she wanted to have.' The paper noted that while a six-week-old fetus would not be considered viable in state court, federal law does not acknowledge the distinction. If someone kills an unborn child while committing a federal crime, it is considered murder, Tampa lawyer Todd Foster, a former assistant U.S. Attorney and FBI agent, said. Clinic: The couple had gone to Welden's father's clinic, pictured, for a scan to confirm the pregnancy . Welden was denied bail after he was deemed a flight risk, but his defense attorney David Weisbrod said Welden had no prior criminal record and said the act was out of character for his client. Welden's father, a board certified . obstetrician and gynecologist who works with infertile couples wishing . to become pregnant, has not been accused of any crime. Andrew Welden worked as an office manager at the Lutz office of Premiere Weight Loss Center, another family business. His . bio on its website says that he studied nutrition and exercise . physiology at the University of Mississippi and the University of . Memphis, and is working toward a degree in sports medicine.","Andrew Welden, 28, 'gave his girlfriend a bottle of abortion-inducing pills and told her they were prescribed antibiotics'

A mother who lost her legs protecting her children as a tornado ravaged their home last year has shown her amazing resilience as she is honored by NASCAR. Stephanie Decker, a mother-of-three who now uses state-of-the-art prosethetics, appeared at the raceway in Darlington, South Carolina for a special event - which was aptly held on Mother's Day. NASCAR invited her to the Southern 500 for its 'Ten Days of Giving' initiative and, while there with her husband and two young children, she was given a tour of the pit area and introduced to drivers. Mrs Decker, 38, gained national attention when she saved her two young children from a tornado that destroyed their home in Henryville, Kentucky last year. Honored: Stephanie Decker is pictured center with her family and racing driver Ryan Newman on Sunday . She covered 10-year-old son Dominic and seven-year-old daughter Reese as a falling beam severed her legs and a second punctured her lung and broke eight ribs. Dominic, who along with his sister only suffered scrapes and bruises, ran for help. It took rescuers 45 minutes to reach her, and when she arrived at hospital she had lost about 50 per cent of her blood. She lost one leg above . the knee and the other foot and since the accident, she has gained the reputation as a determined advocate for others who have lost limbs. Decker has established the Stephanie . Decker Foundation to assist children in need of prosthetics and helping . others gain access to leading edge prosthetics. Inspirational: Mrs Decker is pictured at Darlington Raceway in Darlington, South Carolina on Sunday, more than a year after she saved her two children - including seven-year-old Reese, right - in a tornado . Fighter: Mrs Decker makes her way down pit row with her husband Joe and children, Dominic and Reese . She recently helped push a state law through in Kentucky requiring insurance companies to give patients access to better technology for prosthetic limbs and now has the federal level in her sights. Her family maintains that losing limbs 'could happen to anyone' and that it is Stephanie's fighting spirit since the accident which has shown her real strength of character. Her husband Joe told NASCAR: 'She . and I have both taken the same approach... just the fact she's here and . the kids are here and they're okay, I think we can live with whatever . hand we've been dealt. 'I . told her, ""What you did was great, but I think a ton of moms would have . done the exact same thing. But to me, what set you apart is how you've . handled it since."" Happy family: Stephanie was surrounded by her family at the hospital, including her husband Joe (left), son Dominic (center right) and Reese (right) A mother's love: As soon as the storm passed, Dominic, 8, ran to a neighbor's home for help . 'If you want to sit and dwell on it and go, ""woe is me"" then you're not going to make it very far. She has not done that once.' Mrs Decker added: 'There were about 10 minutes of grieving. Then we knew we had to come up with a plan to get my life back to where it was. 'It's a teaching moment for my kids too. They've learned that life throws you struggles and bring times that you . think are unbearable, but there's always a solution... We adapt and . cope.' Stephanie competed in triathlons with her husband before the accident . and is working to return to similar pastimes with her prosthetics. 'Dream home': The Deckers had spent nine months building their home in Henryville, Louisiana . Gone: The house 'took about nine months to build and about four seconds' to fall, Mrs Decker said . Destruction: . The Decker family home was just one of the hundreds destroyed by . tornadoes in Indiana. Damage can be seen in nearby Marysville which was . entirely wiped off the map by the severe weather . 'I expect to do the things that I did . before, and that's what we need to demand from our insurance . companies,' she said. 'That's what we're going to be fighting for . nationwide.' She and her family were invited to . Yankee Stadium, where Dominic played catch with New York stars Derek . Jeter and Robinson Cano. The family also visited the Oval Office, with Mrs Decker speaking to the president about making sure prosthetics . would be covered by insurance. 'She definitely had an agenda,' joked husband Joe, a baseball coach at Silver Creek High School. She recently revealed that the family has almost finished building their new home in Sellersburg. She also showed off her new legs, which have flexible prosthetic ankles and different settings for driving and walking. She charges the . batteries in her two ankles and one knee every night. Brave: She has shown astonishing determination throughout the year, including as she walked through the White House last June, aided by President Obama, her husband and children . Upbeat: She also danced with Ellen DeGeneres on her show just two months after the accident . 'I get up in the morning and instead of . putting on a pair of shoes, I put on a pair of legs,' Decker told the Courier Journal. 'And . then my day begins. It’s fixing lunches, getting kids off to school.' She also spends as much as two hours every day training at the gym. Decker was injured when a series of mega tornadoes raged across . Southern Indiana and Kentucky last March, killing 39, injuring . many and destroying thousands of homes and schools.

But at first she didn't take it seriously - believing that he was simply talking about getting married. 'I only realized when he brought out the ring box,' she said. 'I was just so overcome.' Feldman also called into the show and said he had been nervous ahead of popping the question 'but figured there'd be a secondary market for diamonds like that' if she said no.

This award-winning image of two Palestinian children killed in an Israeli missile strike being carried to their funeral captured the judge's attention at the World Press Photo of the Year. But since then the photographer Paul Hansen has been accused of manipulating the striking image by splicing together three different photos. Now after a thorough investigation examining the RAW file and the JPEG image entered in the competition, the World Press Photo have announced the photograph was not faked. Verdict: The winning image of the 2013 World Press Photo by Paul Hansen was not faked, it has been announced . 'We have reviewed the RAW image, as . supplied by World Press Photo, and the resulting published JPEG image. It is clear that the published photo was retouched with respect to both . global and local color and tone. Beyond this, however, we find no . evidence of significant photo manipulation or compositing.' In response to the damning allegations being cleared, Mr Hansen, who has worked for the daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter since 2000, told MailOnline: 'I feel relieved that three independent forensic/computer experts in two different countries have made a clear statement. 'The photo have of course also been judged and examined by four different international photo-jurys with industry- experts. 'This is my most examined photograph ever.

A British businesswoman and an Irish welder convicted of having drunken sex in the back of a taxi in Dubai have been sentenced to two months in jail after losing an appeal. Rebecca Blake, 30, from Dorking, Surrey, and Conor McRedmond, 28, from Tullamore, Co. Offaly,   had spent a year fighting the allegations. Witnesses said recruitment executive Blake stripped off before straddling McRedmond, who had his jeans pulled down. Jailed: Recruitment worker Rebecca Blake, 29, from Dorking, Surrey, and Irish welder Conor McRedmond, 28, had spent a year fighting the allegations but yesterday were sentenced to two months in prison . The pair denied the accusations and yesterday said they were ‘disappointed’ by the outcome, which will see both deported after serving their sentences. Blake, who was sacked from her £120,000-a-year post, said: ‘I am devastated by this result and gutted . this has been dragging on for a year. I cannot wait to get home and . start my life now but I am very scared about going to prison.’ McRedmond has been living in Dubai for four years, said: ‘I am disappointed after coming this far and fighting these allegations for so long. I feel they are making an example of us.’ Disappointed: Rebecca Blake and Conor McRedmond walk with their lawyer Shaker al-Shammary outside the Dubai Courts in November, 2012 . Blake and McRedmond  do not have to go to jail immediately and can decide when to hand themselves in – but if they are arrested in the meantime or get into trouble with the law, they will be taken straight to prison. They cannot leave the country until they have served their sentence. The pair said they had been financially crippled by the case after spending more than €50,000 fighting to clear their names. Blake, who moved to Dubai in September 2011, has not been able to find work since she was sacked and neither of them can leave the country after having their passports confiscated. Convicted: Rebecca Blake was sentenced to three months in jail after being found guilty of having sex in the taxi, but was bailed until the outcome of the appeal . Distraught: The 30-year-old broke down as she spoke of her ordeal since she was accused of the crime in Dubai . Embarrassing: Rebecca Blake has said how difficult it has been to tell her parents of the charges . Blake and McRedmond  were arrested on May 4 last year after going on a ten-hour drinking binge. The pair met hours earlier at a brunch, where they admitted getting drunk on free-flowing wine and vodka in an all-inclusive €45-a-head deal. They carried on drinking at a hotel and got into a taxi together at about 10pm. Taxi driver Qaiser Khan, 30, claimed within minutes of getting in, Blake had taken her top off and was writhing on top of McRedmond while ‘making the sounds of a woman having sex’. He pulled over on Sheikh Zayed road and summoned policeman Abdullah Obaid Khamis, who told the court that he found the pair having sex and interrupted them by tapping on the window. He told prosecutors: ‘They kept having sex for four minutes. The man’s shirt was open, his trousers were down to his knees and the woman was not wearing any underwear.’ The taxi driver alleged Blake offered . him ‘a lot of money’ to tell prosecutors they had been kissing rather . than having sex, but he refused. Blake . and McRedmond, who works as a manager at Kelly Steel engineering firm, . said the allegations had been trumped up after they rowed with the taxi . driver about taking a longer route home. Blake was . sacked from her £100,000-a-year job as a recruitment consultant for . Manpower in Dubai following the scandal . The pair were originally convicted in November in the criminal court, where they were both sentenced to three months in jail and given a €630 fine for drinking alcohol – a crime in the Islamic country. The sentence was challenged in the Court of Appeal in February, which cut the sentence by a month and reduced the fine. But the Supreme Court – the highest court in the United Arab Emirates – refused to drop the charges altogether, despite medical reports proving the couple did not have sex. Strict Islamic state: Briton Rebecca Black and . Irishman Conor McRedmond are said to have engaged in a drunken tryst . after leaving a bar in Dubai . Their lawyer Shaker al Shammary yesterday said the statements of the two witnesses were inconsistent, adding: ‘They threatened to complain about the taxi driver and he beat them to it – yet there is no mention of their dispute in the Supreme Court judgment. ‘The medical records show what the witnesses said was not true but this was not taken into account in the ruling.’ The duo’s only options now are to beg for a royal pardon from Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, or they can serve their time and challenge the deportation order in the courts. McRedmond said: ‘We find ourselves in exactly the same position we were in after the original verdict but thousands of pounds poorer. ‘Any court in the world would accept the medical evidence above all else. I love Dubai and wanted to carry on living here but I am left without a choice.’ There were fears their failure to clear their names is part of a crackdown from Dubai authorities on expats flouting their strict rules. Vince Acors and Michelle Palmer, a British couple caught having sex on a beach, were treated more leniently in 2008 when they were convicted on the same charge of indecency and ordered to serve three months in prison, but received a suspended sentence on appeal.","Rebecca Blake, 30, is from Dorking in Surrey and worked in recruitment .

A transsexual woman has won a groundbreaking court appeal in Hong Kong allowing her to marry her boyfriend and forcing the government to re-write the city's marriage laws. The watershed ruling falls short of allowing same-sex marriage - it only covers the right of a transgender person who was born male to marry a man, and for one who was born female to marry a woman. The ruling by the Court of Final Appeal brings the Chinese city in line with many other places in the Asia-Pacific region, including mainland China, where transgender people are allowed to marry as their new gender. Watershed ruling: Hong Kong's top court granted a transgender woman the right to marry her boyfriend in a watershed ruling that falls short of allowing same-sex marriage . The court ruled in favor of the woman, identified only as W. One of the judges on the five-member panel dissented. W's lawyer, Michael Vidler, said his client was 'overjoyed.' W, who is in her 30s, was born a man but had surgery in 2008 to become a woman. Result: The woman, is only known as W. Her lawyer, Michael Vidler, said his client was 'overjoyed' The hospital issued a letter certifying her new gender. Vidler read a statement by W to reporters in which she said that after the surgery she has lived her life 'as a woman and been treated as a woman in all respects except as regards my right to marriage. This decision rights that wrong.' In a conference call later with reporters, W said, 'I'm very glad that I can finally get married to my beloved boyfriend in Hong Kong.' She added that she hopes the ruling will have a positive influence how sexual minorities are seen in Hong Kong, where many hold conservative views. Vidler said the ruling won't take effect for 12 months, giving the government time to change marriage laws. The judges noted that from evidence and submissions received, 'it appears in the Asia-Pacific region, such marriages are permitted' in mainland China, Singapore, India, South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand. Same-sex marriage remains rare in the region, though New Zealand approved it last month. In China, the Ministry of Civil Affairs clarified the law in 2003 to make it clear that transgender marriage is legal. Hong Kong, a former British colony, came back under Chinese control in 1997 but was granted a high degree of autonomy from Beijing and retains a separate legal system.","The watershed ruling falls short of allowing same-sex marriage .

High stakes: The man began threatening and insulting staff at the arcade in Bergamo, Italy, after losing £19,000 on slot machines . The man had arrived at the arcade in with several bags of cash, telling staff he had just secured a . successful deal and wanted to celebrate his luck. Staff said he played casino style machines with a minimum 10 Euro (£8) bet for several hours and had racked up several wins before his luck started to turn and he began to lose. As his money ran out he left the arcade only to return minutes later with more money that he said had been 'loaned' to him by friends but his losing streak continued and at around 3am when he had nothing left to gamble he began threatening and insulting staff.

Insulted: Deborah is upset because the £705,000 of interim payments were not ringfenced, so she could spend on what Calum needed . A mother who sued because doctors failed to spot her unborn son was disabled has to sell the home she bought to care for him in because the NHS wants almost half the cash back after he died suddenly. Deborah Mackay, 33, took legal action against Bedford Hospital NHS Trust after scans failed to detect spina bifida in her unborn baby Calum, depriving her of the choice to terminate the pregnancy. The Trust admitted negligence and agreed an out of court settlement beginning with £705,000 of interim payments with a final figure to be set when Calum reached 10. Ms Mackay was free to spend most of the money on a specially-adapted home where Calum could be provided with full-time care. Experts predicted a normal life expectancy for the youngster but he suddenly died from organ failure, aged just six, in November 2011. Three months after his death she received a letter from Bedford Hospital demanding almost half their money back. Health bosses said £330,000 of the . original pay out was rightfully theirs because it was only intended to . pay for Calum's care, which he no longer needs. Deborah - who had been living in an unsuitable cramped bedsit before Calum's birth - had spent the rest of the money on looking after her son during his brief life. Ms Mackay says she will have to sell her four bedroom house in Clapham, Bedfordshire, to meet the demand. But she says she can't bring herself to part with the property which is full of memories of Calum - and parting with it would leave her homeless. House: This home in Clapham, Bedfordshire, was bought with the NHS compensation so Calum could be . properly cared for but now it will have to be sold, his mother says . 'The settlement was the closest I was ever going to get for an apology for the fact his spinal bifida went unnoticed,' she said. 'I had the right to choose whether to have my son or not taken away from me. 'Three months after he died I was told to start paying back the money because Calum hadn't lived as long as they expected him too. 'It wasn't enough that I was grieving - I had just lost my son and then they pulled the rug out from under me again. 'They advised I put the house on the market and return a large proportion of the sale to the hospital. 'It feels like I am being penalised for my son dying. 'This has never been about the money, it is about decency and doing the right thing by a vulnerable little boy - and his mum.' Calum with his mum shortly after his born, but despite his disability he was told that his life may not have been short . Scan: Medics failed to spot that Calum had spina bifida, and his mother awarded £700,000 to pay towards his care . Deborah knew from early on in her pregnancy there was an increased risk her baby could have life-limiting conditions because of the medication she was taking for her epilepsy. She underwent several routine and specialist scans but Calum's problems went undetected and she was told everything was okay. She was devastated when her baby - her first and only child - was born with spinal bifida and hydrocephalus, which causes water on the brain. Just minutes after his birth Calum was rushed to Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridgeshire, for a life-saving nine-hour operation on his spine. The struggle of copying with his crippling illness put a strain on her marriage to husband Stuart, 35, and the couple split up a year after Calum was born. After a string of health problems Calum was diagnosed with a rare disorder called fetal valproate syndrome, caused when the foetus is exposed to valproic acid during the first three months of pregnancy. The acid is found in a drug used in the treatment of epilepsy to control seizures but only causes problems for a small percentage of pregnant women. Growing up: Calum in leg braces aged 5, but less than a year later the poorly little boy passed away . Unlucky: Minutes after his birth he was rushed to Addenbrookes in Cambridge and it was hoped he would have an average life expectancy . Deborah sued Bedford Hospital for 'wrongful birth' claiming they had taken away the right to make a properly informed decision on terminating her baby. The hospital trust admitted negligence and agreed to pay for a 'life-time of care' for her son beginning with interim payments, ahead of a final settlement when Calum turned ten. Had the case ever gone through it was due to reach several millions with Deborah potentially receiving an estimated £6 million for a lifetime of care for the youngster. Deborah invested £450,000 of the interim payments in a new home for her and Calum in the belief the property would be in her name for life. But just three months after Calum passed away letters from the hospital's solicitors demanded she pay back £330,000 of back-dated payments for her son's care. Solicitors have advised her to sell her home, which would cover the costs and leave her with £75,000 to keep as part of a new settlement. Deborah added: 'If I had known how poorly Calum was going to be I may have considered a termination but that choice was taken away from me. 'I miss him every day. He was the most beautiful boy in the world and he brought me so much joy but I watched him suffer. Much loved: Deborah with her son Calum who died suddenly in November 2011. Three months later the NHS wrote to her asking for cash . 'Getting the money wasn't a victory, it wasn't a happy ending, it was just what we needed to cope. 'Now I have lost him, and now I have to sell our house. It's all I have left of him.' Deborah's solicitor Adam Copeland said Calum's death was unforeseen and he wanted to make sure she receives a fair settlement after 'nearly a decade of heartbreak.' He said: 'A potential deadline comes around in July and we don't know what the situation is going to be. 'I don't think anyone is going to physically kick her out. The negotiations are still ongoing in regards to that.' The NHS today said the repayment to the public purse was necessary because the final settlement was more than the interim money already paid to Deborah. A spokeswoman for the NHS Litigation Authority said she said: 'The NHS Litigation Authority and NHS Bedford Trust appreciate this is a difficult time for Ms Mackay. 'We also have a responsibility to safeguard public funds, there are no plans currently to force a sale of this property.'","Deborah Mackay, 33, won landmark legal case for her son Calum .

Evil: Matthew Atherton, 23, and Anne Turnbull, 30, leave Preston Crown Court after being charged with neglect. Their three-month-old son, Liam, died from pneumonia after they held a drunken all-night party . A couple who left their four-month-old baby to die of pneumonia on a winter's night while they threw a drunken party are facing jail. Matthew Atherton, 23, girlfriend Anne Turnbull, 30, and three friends sank 60 cans of lager, Jack Daniels whiskey and wine whilst little Liam Atherton was succumbing to the effects of cold and hunger. The infant had been diagnosed with a cold earlier that day yet had been left in a downstairs room whilst the back door was left open to allow the cigarette smoke from the party to filter outside. Despite the youngster suffering a seizure, his unconcerned parents ignored pleas by guests to call an ambulance. He was eventually found lifeless . in his moses basket at 11.15am the following morning after Turnbull . went to check on him. He was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead a . short time later. Police . who went to the house in Blackburn, Lancs., following the tragedy in . January 2011 found a wheelie bin stuffed full of empty lager cans and . wine bottles. The kitchen tops were also covered with empty alcohol . cans. Blood tests ordered by . the police showed Atherton was three times the drink drive limit at the . time Liam was discovered. It emerged the party had gone on until 7am. The couple were known to social services who had been giving them . support. At Preston Crown Court, Atherton and Turnbull, both admitted a charge of child neglect and were warned they could be jailed. Earlier . the hearing was told Liam had been born prematurely in September 2010 . and spent his first few weeks of his life in the neonatal intensive care . unit at the Royal Blackburn Hospital. No remorse: Smirking Atherton after the court hearing. He and Turnbull drank until 7am on the night Liam died . Callous: Turnbull held the party despite knowing Liam was ill and vulnerable . His . early arrival meant the boy was taking special medication to encourage . his development. On the day of the tragedy he had been seen by the . health visitor and she had diagnosed him with a cold. But . despite his vulnerable condition his parents decided to throw a party . at their terraced home and invited a handful of friends. When the party was in full flow Turnbull invited her sister Zoe Heap and her partner to visit. As . they arrived, Miss Heap discovered the front room where Liam was . sleeping was cold and became angry after noticing the baby was hungry . and in a wet nappy. Miss . Heap changed Liam and fed him and then passed him to her partner for him . to settle. But the youngster then suffered a 'fit or seizure'. Turnbull . and Atherton, who have two other children under the age of two, were . told about the seizure - but they refused to call an ambulance despite . being encouraged by Miss Heap and her partner. Atherton attributed the fit down to Liam having a cold and the tot was put back in his moses basket. Police began investigating after being notified of Liam's sudden death by a nurse at the Royal Blackburn Hospital. A . post-mortem examination at the time did not reveal any significant . injuries but a coroner later ruled Liam had died from pneumonia. His . parents were charged with neglect three weeks later. Liam died in his parents' house in Blackburn. He suffered a fit before he passed away . Atherton initially denied wrongdoing but changed his mind and pleaded guilty on the second day of his trial. Both . he and Turnbull were bailed for the preparation of reports but were . told by Judge Christopher Cornwall: 'All sentencing options remain . open.' Both will be sentenced on June 21. After . the case Detective Sergeant Sarah Hargreaves, of Blackburn police . public protection unit, said: 'The conclusion of this case comes after a . protracted and sensitive inquiry. I hope the sentence will reflect the . gravity and the seriousness of this offence.' At . the time of the tragedy neighbours said they saw Turnbull shouting and . screaming in the street after dialing 999. One said: 'She had gone to . sleep on the couch, with the baby put in his rocker. But when she woke . up, he wasn't breathing. 'Then . there was a lot of commotion. It is devastating news. You just think of . your own children at a time like this - I couldn't live through . something like that.' A . spokesman for Blackburn with Darwen Council said: 'This is a tragic . case, the family were known to children's services and we had previously . been supporting them.

Back in the game: Former international ice dancer Tracy Compton has returned to the rink three years after glaucoma left her completely blind . Nearly 30 years later, glaucoma claimed the sight in her right eye, leaving her completely blind. Skating since she was five years old, Ms Compton 'took to it like a duck to water' going on to spend six hours a day skating in her teens. Ms Compton stopped skating when she had her first three children. After returning to it briefly in her early thirties, she stopped again when her mum died in 2007. 'My mum used to work in the ice rink shop. When I lost her it was quite hard to go back,' said Ms Compton. Supported to get back on the ice by a friend and fellow skater, Ms Compton said: 'I was transported back in time. It was like I'd never been off the ice.' Heightened senses: Tracy, who suffered detached retinas in her left eye at the age of 13, says she manages to avoid other skaters using her sense of hearing . Ms Compton uses her hearing to avoid collisions with other skaters. She said: 'You can hear somebody's movements. I can hear the skates on the ice. 'Different moves sound different, like going forward or backwards sound different. I never really thought about it before.' 'I'm an ice dancer at heart,' said Ms Compton, who is now working towards her level nine ice dance medal.

Tragedy: Experienced maintenance engineer Gary Whiting died after being crushed by the 145-tonne metal press . Defence giant BAE Systems has been ordered to pay almost £350,000 in compensation after a worker died when he was crushed by a 145-tonne metal press at one of its sites. Experienced maintenance engineer Gary Whiting, 51, from Hull, was part of a team of four men performing a routine service on the machine when the tragedy occured. Hull Crown Court heard how Mr Whiting . entered the press, which was the size of a two-bedroom house, to remove a piece of equipment. A the same . time, a colleague at the other end started a full test . cycle, unaware that he was inside. Mr Whiting was trapped by the 45 square metre frame as it descended and he died the same day in hospital from crush injuries. His death at the BAE plant at Brough, East Yorkshire, in November 2008 was described as an 'entirely preventable tragedy' by the Health and Safety Executive. An investigation exposed a series of flaws in safety practices during maintenance of the metal press, which was used to make components for Hawk jets, some of which had existed for many years. Failings included a lack of a suitable risk assessments and control measures to prevent workers entering dangerous parts of the machine during testing or to stop the machine if anyone did enter a danger zone. BAE Systems (Operations) Ltd of . Farnborough Aerospace Centre, Farnborough, Hampshire, was fined £250,000 . and ordered to pay £97,153 costs after pleading guilty to a breach of . Section 2 (1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act l974. The company had entered a guilty plea at a hearing last year. After . the hearing, HSE Inspector Mark Welsh said: 'This was an entirely . preventable tragedy that devastated Mr Whiting’s wife, Jackie, his two . children and his wider family. 'They have shown admirable resilience during what has been a protracted and, at times painful, process. Risks: Gary Whiting, 51, was servicing this metal press at the BAE Systems plant when his colleague set it onto a full test cycle, unaware that he was inside retrieving a piece of equipment . 'The dangers of maintenance work on these types of machines are well- known yet BAE Systems Ltd failed to identify those risks and its serious failings led to this tragedy. 'Although the press machine had been serviced regularly, it was done in the same unacceptable way and it is surprising there had not been an earlier incident. 'The guarding was inadequate and there were no key safety systems, no light guards or interlocks on the doors of the machine; nothing that would have either prevented entry to dangerous parts or stopped the machine if entry was made. 'In addition, there were no instructions, either written or verbal, given by BAE to workers about how to carry out the testing process safely. 'This incident should serve as a reminder to companies to ensure that dangerous parts of their machines are identified and measures taken to properly protect their workers. 'No company should put its employees at unnecessary risk.' A statement released on behalf of Mr Whiting’s widow, Jackie, two children and brother, said: 'We are pleased that, more than four-and-a-half years after Gary was killed, BAE Systems have been brought to justice. 'The complete absence of any safe system of work for the job Gary was performing beggars belief. “There wasn’t a suitable risk assessment for the job he was doing. The accident happened at the BAE Systems plant in Brough, East Yorkshire . 'The machine he had been working in had been operated with a person inside it before and it is pure luck no-one was killed in the machine before Gary. 'If BAE Systems had spent even a relatively small amount on safety features for the machine he was working in, Gary would have been alive today.' The statement said: 'Gary shone as a light in all of our lives, and the lives of all those who knew him. 'Gary had the most infectious smile. He was always full of life, fun and energy, and was a devoted, loving husband, dad, granddad and brother. 'Gary is missed terribly. The loss to us is unbelievable, we struggle without him, but life goes on and he will never ever be forgotten.' In a statement, the BAE Systems said: 'BAE Systems deeply regrets the death of its employee and colleague, Gary Whiting, in November 2008. 'BAE Systems appreciates the anguish this accident has caused and will continue to cause to Gary's family, friends and colleagues and for that BAE Systems sincerely apologises. 'The accident at BAE Systems Brough site, which claimed Gary's life, has been the subject of comprehensive and in-depth investigations, both by BAE Systems and by the Health & Safety Executive. BAE Systems has co-operated fully with the HSE in its investigation throughout.' The company said the incident was an 'isolated failure at a site that generally has an excellent health and safety record' and said it pleaded guilty after acknowledging there was a flaw in its safety procedures. A spokesman added that since the tragedy a number of improvements have been made at the site to ensure that such an accident never happens again.","Gary Whiting, 51, was performing routine maintenance when accident happened at plant in Brough, East Yorkshire .

The Maya civilization is well-known for its elaborate temples, sophisticated writing system, and mathematical and astronomical developments - yet the civilization's origins have remained something of a mystery. However, a newly discovered series of plazas and pyramids have revealed that the civilisation mixed with other early South American cultures more than previously thought. Archaeologists at the University of Arizona say the find means 'early Maya culture is really more complex than we thought.' Excavations at Ceibal, an ancient Maya site in Guatemala, suggest that the origins of early Maya civilization are more complex than previously thought . Anthropologists typically fall into one of two competing camps with regard to the origins of Maya civilization. The first camp believes that it developed almost entirely on its own . in the jungles of what is now Guatemala and southern Mexico. The second believes that the Maya civilization developed as the . result of direct influences from the older Olmec civilization and its . center of La Venta. 'We're saying that the scenario of early Maya culture is really more . complex than we thought,' said UA anthropology graduate student Victor . Castillo, who co-authored the paper in Science. 'We have this idea of the origin of Maya civilization as an indigenous . development, and we have this other idea that it was an external . influence that triggered the social complexity of Maya civilization.

Godolphin had already announced all horses in Al Zarooni’s care would not run until they had been dope tested and cleared.

Bittar said: ‘We are not saying this . is the end of it, but it is the end of the beginning. We will also . provide advice to Godolphin of necessary changes to its procedures and . controls where appropriate — this will be supported by Godolphin’s own . review.

A woman prison officer was found naked in bed with a convict dubbed 'one of the most feared men in Scotland' after helping him abscond from jail, a court heard. Police hunting escaped convict James Holland burst into Christine Robertson's flat and found the couple in bed together, after she had allegedly helped the notorious thug flee prison. Robertson, 45, was found in the compromising position after previously 'appointing herself' as Holland's 'personal officer', it is alleged. Relationship: Christine Robertson, pictured arriving at court today, was discovered naked in bed with violent career criminal James Holland (right) in March last year, a court heard . She had aided and abetted career criminal Holland in helping him abscond from Castle Huntly open jail in Perthshire, a jury at Dundee Sheriff Court heard today. Violent Holland, who had spent the last 20 years in jail for various crimes, absonded prison on March 16 last year while serving an eight-year term for assault and robbery. He was described as 'one of the most feared and dangerous men in Scotland' today, but amazingly had been kept in open prison conditions before absconding last year. The court heard that when riot police raided Robertson's flat in Angus, near Dundee on March 17 last year and found her naked in bed with Holland, she told an officer: 'That's my job f****d', before giggling. Police had broken down the door of Robertson's flat after receiving intelligence she was there with Holland, before having to Taser the wanted prisoner when he waved a large kitchen knife at officers. The trial was told that Holland had been moved to Castle Huntly open prison from Saughton in Edinburgh after being deemed 'low risk', despite his track record of violence. Prison officer Graham Tait told the court he was later moved back to Saughton in October due to 'behavioural issues'. Fled: Robertson is accused of aiding and abetting Holland after he absconded from Castle Huntly open prison near Dundee last year . Violent: Career criminal Holland, who has spent 20 years in jail, was moved from Saughton prison near Edinburgh due to 'behavioural issues' but was later taken to an open prison despite his criminal past . But despite that Holland was again moved back to open conditions - first at Noranside in Angus and then again at Castle Huntly just weeks later. Fiscal depute Douglas Wiseman asked Mr Tait: 'Were you aware that Christine Robertson had changed the prison records to make herself James Holland's personal officer? He replied: 'I heard that after the fact.' Mr Wiseman asked: 'She made herself personal officer?' Mr Tait replied: 'Yes.' Mr Wiseman asked: 'She wasn't appointed to that post - she self appointed herself to that post?' Mr Tait: 'I believe that is the case.' Mr Tait also told the court that Robertson’s role as Holland’s personal prison officer at Castle Huntly began when she conducted an interview with him when he entered the jail. The court earlier heard that personal officers act as an 'advocate' for prisoners - and accompany prisoners on escorted leave from jail. The trial was earlier told that Holland and Robertson had left the jail together on one occasion for a day out to Crail and Anstruther in Fife - visiting a chip shop. Trial: A jury at Dundee Sheriff Court heard Robertson said to an officer when she was caught in bed with Holland: 'That's my job f****d' On another occasion she accompanied him to visit a social worker in Glasgow. The trial has already heard how police received intelligence that Holland was at Robertson's Angus flat - before breaking down her door in a planned operation to locate him. When they burst in they found Holland and Robertson naked together in her bed. Holland then had to be blasted with a Taser stun gun to subdue him as he waved a knife at officers. Robertson, 45, Monifieth, Angus, denies aiding and abetting James Holland in absconding and attempting to defeat the ends of justice. The trial continues.

Prosecutor Peter Bardsley said . witnesses had seen Mitchinson driving the 630 brake . horsepower Lamborghini at ‘excessive speed’. 'Due to a combination of a wet road . and skidding on a man hole cover, he lost control, left the carriageway . for around 40 metres, came back onto it and hit the back of the parked . car,' said Mr Bardsley. Mitchinson of Low Skelyghyll . Farm, Windermere, admitted driving without due care and attention on . November 6 last year while carrying out an MoT on behalf of Station . Garage, Staveley, Cumbria, set up by his father, Alan. The court heard the prized Lamborghini, owned by millionaire hotel boss Stephen . Leahy, was damaged beyond repair. Insurance companies paid out £87,000 to Mr Leahy and £7,500 to the owner of the Ford Focus mother-of-two Marianne Kitchen. But magistrates fined Mitchinson just £280 as well as ordering him to pay court costs of £350 and a victim surcharge of £30 to Mr Leahy. Six penalty points were also added to . his licence. Afterwards, both car owners slammed Mitchinson's sentence, . with Mr Leahy describing it as merely 'a slap on the wrist'. Mr Leahy, 46, a . Lake District hotelier and entrepreneur, said: 'I’m appalled he thought . it fit to drive like that through a quaint, little country village in a . customer’s car. He should not be allowed behind the wheel of a . customer’s car.' Written off: Owner Stephen Leahy with his £220,000 Lamborghini which suffered £87,000 worth of damage in the crash . Careful: Mr Leahy said : Andrew Mitchinson said he had treated his Lamborghini like 'Driving Miss Diasy' before it was crashed by Mitchinson . He said despite its capabilities, he had always driven the Lamborghini carefully. The 211mph supercar was one of just 20 LP640 models made and had only 24,500 miles on the clock. 'That car was driven like Driving Miss Daisy and I’ve always been really careful with it,' said Mr Leahy. 'At the end of the day he was a very, very silly lad and he’s been given a slap on the wrist.' Ms Kitchen, 33, said: 'Basically all he has got is the . equivalent of two speeding tickets for trashing two cars. Ms Kitchen described the justice system as ‘a sham' following Mitchinson's sentence. 'That Ford Focus, was my Lamborghini,' she said. 'It’s the best car I’ve ever had. It was only three years old. Fuming: Mother-of-two Marianne Kitchen said her Ford Focus was like 'my Lamborghini' before it was written off by Mitchinson . 'Basically all he has got is the . equivalent of two speeding tickets for trashing two cars. It left us . without a car. It was a total write off. 'I was hoping he would receive some . sort of a ban, not a long one but maybe just some sort of re-learning of . driving skills because he really should know how important it is not to . be trashing cars.' Mr Mitchinson declined to comment on the fine but explained why he had not apologised to both car owners in person. 'I was advised by the solicitors not . to contact them because of the court proceedings and they have both been . apologised to by the garage,' he said. His father Alan Mitchinson stressed . the incident was purely an accident, and it was ‘the first accident . involving a customer’s car for 30 years.

Located on the western coast of the . Dardanelles, the British hoped by eventually getting to Constantinople . that they would link up with the Russians. The . intention of this was to then knock Turkey out of the war. A naval . attack began on February 19 but it was called off after three . battleships were sunk. Then . by the time of another landing on April 25, the Turks had been given . time to prepare better fortifications and increased their armies . sixfold. Australian and New . Zealand troops won a bridgehead at Anzac Cove as the British aimed to . land at five points in Cape Helles - but only managed three. The British still required reinforcements in these areas and the Turkish were able to bring extra troops onto the peninsula to better defend themselves. A standstill continued through the summer in hot and filthy conditions, and the campaign was eventually ended by the War Council in winter 1915. The invasion had been intended to . knock Turkey out of the war, but in the end it only gave the Russians . some breathing space from the Turks. Turkey . lost around 300,000 men and the Allies had 214,000 killed - more than . 8,000 of whom were Australian soldiers, in a disastrous campaign. Anzac . Cove became a focus for Australian pride after forces were stuck . there in squalid conditions for eight months, defending the area from the Turks. The Anzac . soldiers who arrived on the . narrow strip of beach were faced with a difficult environment of steep cliffs and ridges - and . almost daily shelling.

No consequences: Former trooper Detrick McClellan has had citations dismissed despite killing a woman . An on-duty Florida Highway Patrol trooper who killed a grandmother in a 90 mph collision has had his case dismissed after the officer who gave him the citations missed his trial. A newly-released video of Detrick McClellan's court hearing shows how troopers in the court room laughed as a distracted judge dismissed the case, before they shook the officer's hand. The video has contributed to the firing of a commander and an investigation is now underway to determine if seven troopers at the hearing acted inappropriately. 'If the FHP allows it to stand, what they're saying is the law does not apply to us, even if we kill people,' Dennis Kenney, from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told the Sun Sentinel. On February 10, 2012, McClellan, 34, was responding to a call about someone throwing rocks from an overpass as he drove through Gadsden County. As he drove to the scene without his emergency lights on, he reached speeds of more than 100mph and lost control as he travelled around a bend, where the recommended speed was just 35 mph. He smashed into Michelle Campbell's vehicle, throwing her 12-year-old granddaughter through the windshield and injuring her niece. Ms Campbell, 51, died hours later. FHP Cpl. C. Brooks Yarborough . investigated the crash and found McClellan at fault. He was fired and cited with three traffic violations, careless driving, speeding, and failure to use his emergency lights. Scroll down for video . Dismissed: A video of the hearing shows troopers laughing with the judge as they say they want the charges dismissed. The officer who gave the citations was unable to attend so it was granted . But prosecutors refused to file criminal charges, finding that McClellan's . driving was not equivalent to vehicular homicide. 'He . responded to [the call] rapidly because that's a dangerous thing, rocks . hitting cars,' Willie Meggs, state attorney, told the Sentinel. 'We made the conclusion . that there was a life lost, but he was trying to save a life.' A hearing was held on November 5, but two hours before it started, the judge's assistant received a call saying Yarborough had a 'medical emergency' and told his supervisor he could not attend. The supervisor, Sgt. Aaron Stephens, failed to send someone else . or request the hearing be rescheduled, the FHP told the Sentinel. Seven troopers attended the hearing in Gadsden County Judge Kathy Garner's courtroom, but each said they could not represent the FHP against McClellan. Crash site: He was driving at more than 100 mph as he responded to a call before the crash last year . Tragic: He killed a 51-year-old woman in this car and injured her two passengers, including a 12-year-old . One trooper, Cpl. Michael Cross, told the judge he had no authority to speak for Yarborough as he stood beside McClellan and his lawyer. When the lawyer asked Cross if he would agree to dismiss the citations, he said: 'Why not? I'm easy to please,' as laughter echoed throughout the courtroom. The judge, who admitted she had been distracted by paperwork, said: 'So y'all want it dismissed? There's no objection? C'mon, y'all Candid Cameraing me?' The lawyer, Stephen Webster, added: 'If the agency felt this strongly about these citations, they certainly would have someone here.' Destruction: Her family said they were stunned to discover McClellan's citations were dismissed . Loss: McClellan was fired from his job after failing to follow the proper procedure when responding to a call . Within two minutes of the start of the hearing, the judge said: 'Hearing no objection, or no one's here, I will go on and dismiss the citations.' Despite being responsible for the death of a woman, McClellan walked out with no consequences, and even shook hands with fellow troopers as he left the room. The victim's family said they are shocked by the outcome of the trial, and had not even been told it was going ahead. 'It . was appalling and it hurt because I feel like they were cheering, . rooting him on, for a death he caused,' her daughter, Annekquah Knight, . said. 'They knew he was wrong. I think it's just because he was a . trooper, and they look out for each other.' Not the end: Other troopers are now under investigation for their conduct in McClellan's case . They added that the granddaughter has undergone surgery and has been left with facial scarring. McClellan claims that the FHP failed to maintain his car and he lost control when he glanced down at the 'check engine' light. He has been fired from the role. The investigation into the troopers in the court room is still pending, but the officer who failed to appear at the case is not being investigated, as he reported his absence to his supervisor.

President Hollande met with the Queen at Windsor Castle yesterday following his meeting with David Cameron . During his visit to Windsor Castle, the Queen offered two signed portraits of herself and Prince Philip . The talks came as the European . Commission demanded an extra £12billion be added to the planned . £850billion EU budget for the period between 2014 and 2020, adding . £1.5billion to the bill for British taxpayers, which was already . expected to top £100billion. Officials in Brussels said the . increase was just a ‘mechanical exercise’ but the Treasury reacted with . fury and demanded that the budget rise by no more than inflation. Mr . Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘We both think the proposal on the . table is unacceptable, we both recognise there is a need for restraint.’ But senior sources made clear that Mr . Hollande refused to support a deal which Mr Cameron and German . Chancellor Angela Merkel struck a year ago to oppose inflation-busting . rises in the budget. Mr Cameron and Mr Hollande held talks . and a working lunch lasting 95 minutes – an attempt to make up for Mr .

"By . Sean Poulter . UPDATED: . 07:03 EST, 5 January 2012 . Shopping centres have triggered a Big Brother row after installing equipment that allows them to track customers using their mobile phone signals. The technology has raised privacy concerns after it emerged that major shopping centre owner Land Securities has installed it at ten of Britain’s biggest malls. These include the giant Cabot Circus, Bristol; Gunwharf Quays, Portsmouth; Princesshay, Exeter; Buchanan Galleries, Glasgow; Bon Accord & St Nicholas, Aberdeen; and The Centre, Livingston. A tiny yellow sign in Exeter's Princesshay shopping centre is the only warning customers receive that their mobile phone signal is being 'tracked' by Footpath's scanners. There is no way to opt out except not to enter or to turn off your mobile . Malls using the FootPath system in the . London area include One New Change and New Street Square in the City; . Cardinal Place, Victoria; and The Galleria, Hatfield. Path Intelligence, which developed . the system in the UK, said it includes safeguards to prevent spying on . individuals and that no personal information is collected. Rather, it is designed to track . people’s movements to better understand what shops and services they . find most interesting or useful. However, most shoppers are completely . in the dark about the tracking technology, and the only way to escape it . is to turn off the mobile phone. The 'warning' sign in the Princesshay shopping centre. Nick Pickles of Big Brother Watch says, 'It is assumed that the shopping centre has the automatic right to track people's mobile phones - to me that's wrong.' Nick Pickles, of privacy and civil . liberties group Big Brother Watch, said the law needs to be tightened to . cope with new mobile phone tracking systems. ‘People are right to be worried that . their mobile phones can be turned into tracking devices very easily, . without their permission or knowledge,’ he said. ‘While we have been given assurances . that the FootPath technology is not capable of capturing personal . information or sending communications  to people’s phones, other . technologies which would allow this are available. 'Such tracking and communications would be a significant intrusion  on privacy.’ Shoppers told about the tracking were concerned that they were effectively being followed without their permission. Path Intelligence says that its use of phone-tracking technology is widespread on Britain's High Streets - and that 'major' chains already use the technology . A customer at Princesshay, Hilda . Luscombe, said: ‘This is another invasion of our privacy. We shouldn’t . have to switch off our phones to opt out. This is just spying on us.’ Another customer, Robert McConnell, . said: ‘In the George Orwell  book 1984 everyone was saying ‘‘Big Brother . Is Watching You’’. In 2012, everyone is asking ‘‘Who’s watching Big . Brother?’’.’ How it works: The FootPath system explained . Path Intelligence chief executive . Sharon Biggar wouldn’t name all the malls using the system, to maintain . the privacy of the firm’s clients. So shoppers can only know it is being . used if they spot the small signs put up by the centres. Miss Biggar insisted the technology . had been misunderstood. ‘This is in no way an invasion of privacy, we . cannot identify shoppers’ information,’ she said. ‘We cannot identify phone numbers or who an individual customer is. It is very much like watching dots walking around a room. ‘We are very open with the public. We . ask our clients to have signage up where the system is operating. The . signs are exactly the same as the ones for CCTV.’ She insisted the system was far less . intrusive than the tracking used by internet giants who follow the . activities of online shoppers. Land Securities said the technology . ‘is fairly common in the retail arena’ and added: ‘We are not monitoring . a private individual. We record the movements of a mobile phone. We are . not holding any data on anyone, all we get is a red dot telling us . where it travelled to.’ Path Intelligence is combined with sales data to create a full 'picture' of the effectiveness of shop layouts .","Technology installed at ten of UK's biggest malls .

By the time they came down, they were convinced it was a mountain... and not just because their legs were tired. At 1,998ft, the Cumbrian hill used to be  just shy of the 2,000ft (609.6 metres)  required by Ordnance Survey to be given mountain status. Armed with GPS technology, friends . John Barnard, Graham Jackson and Myrddyn Phillips worked out that it was . in fact about three quarters of an inch over the limit, so it is . actually 609.62m. Elevation: Thack Moor in the Cumbrian Pennines has now been reclassified as a mountain after three ramblers measured it with GPS equipment . Mountain-makers: Mr Phillips, Mr Jackson and Mr Barnard on the summit of Thack Moor . Ordnance Survey has since checked . their data and confirmed it will amend its maps and listings to make . Thack Moor England’s 254th mountain. Their achievement has echoes of the 1995 Hugh Grant film The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill But Came Down A Mountain. Grant’s character, a cartographer, infuriates a Welsh village by measuring their hill at just below mountain status. The villagers respond by building an earth cairn on the top to increase its height. Rugged beauty: Thack Moor is now England's 254th mountain . Peak: The view from the summit of Thack Moor. The trio's data was corroborated by Ordnance Survey . Mr Barnard, 63, and Mr Jackson, 62, are retired research chemists from North Wales and Cheshire. Together with Mr Phillips, a 53-year-old former print firm manager who . lives near Shrewsbury, they have measured more than 100 hills in . England, Scotland and Wales in five years, spending around £5,000 on . Leica GPS survey equipment. Thack Moor is the second they have . turned into a mountain. The first, in 2008, was Snowdonia’s Mynydd . Graig Goch. Mr Jackson said: ‘We have been keen hillwalkers for many . years and we got talking about the height of some of the hills and . modern GPS technology available and decided to give surveying a go.’ They first walked up Thack Moor, near . the village of Renwick, last August. After making their first . measurement they returned last month to double check it and came up with . an identical reading. Mark Greaves, of Ordnance Survey, . said: ‘Because the software that we have available is far better and .

'It took us quite a while to find the . absolute highest point of Thack Moor, which we did by taking various . readings. The summit is a patch a short grass and moss. 'We were a bit cautious when we took the first measurement because there was only two centimetres in it.

In the film, villagers delay the cartographers' departure while they build an earth cairn on top of the hill to make it high enough to be a mountain . The film is set in 1917 and revolves around two English cartographers, Garrad and his junior, Anson (portrayed by Hugh Grant). They arrive at the fictional Welsh village of Ffynnon Garw (translated as 'Rough Fountain' or 'Rough Spring' in Welsh) to measure its 'mountain' The village is horrified when the two men tell them it is merely a hill as it is just short of the required height. The villagers delay the cartographers' departure while they build an earth cairn on top of the hill to make it high enough. It is based on a story heard by director Christopher Monger from his grandfather about the real village of Taff's Well in Wales.","Thack Moor has been re-classified thanks to three ramblers .

Oxford comes top after producing 401 alumni worth £20million or more, and Cambridge is in second place with 361 - but Cambridge has the most billionaires. The average super-rich graduate from Cambridge has a fortune of £169million, more than twice as much as Oxford's ultra-wealthy ex-students. Three London universities make up the rest of the list's top five, with Manchester, Nottingham and Birmingham also appearing high on the list. Topping the list: Oxford has more super-wealthy graduates than any other British university as 401 of its alumni have amassed fortunes of more than £20million, with an average of £83million each . Wealth: Cambridge has produced 361 multi-millionaire alumni worth an average of £169million each . Cambridge's wealthy alumni, including . Cobra Beer entrepreneur Lord Bilimoria, actor Sacha Baron Cohen and . former Barclays chairman Marcus Agius, have a combined wealth of . £61billion, according to the study by wealth analyst Wealth-X. The average super-rich Oxford . graduate, a group including the likes of financier Nat Rothschild, .

The list was compiled by counting up the number of former students from each university who are believed to be worth at least £20million, taking into account their earnings, properties and other assets . London universities occupy the rest . of the list's top five, with London School of Economics, Imperial . College London and London Business School in third, fourth and fifth place. While London Business School may be best-known for its successful business leaders such as Cyrus Mistry, chairman of Indian conglomerate Tata Teas, it also boasts political graduates such as minister and Tory MP for Putney Justine Greening. The only other institution to boast more than 100 mega-rich alumni is the University of Manchester. However, on a global scale the Oxbridge universities are the only British institutions to make the cut, with 17 of the top 20 wealth creators being from the U.S. Despite the reputation of Oxford and . Cambridge as bastions of the aristocratic elite, relatively few of their . multi-millionaires inherited their wealth. More than two thirds of Oxbridge . alumni worth more than £20million made their fortunes through their own . efforts with no help from their families. At the University of Edinburgh, by contrast, fewer than half made their millions thanks to an entrepreneurial spirit, with the majority relying on an inheritance to build their own fortune. The University of Birmingham is where the most self-made millionaires can be found - 84 per cent of its super-rich graduates became wealthy on their own. Entrepreneurial: 84 per cent of the 68 super-rich from the University of Birmingham, pictured, made their money themselves without inheriting from their families .

Oxford: Wealthy alumni of the university include financier Nat Rothschild, who is worth £700million, and entrepreneur Martha Lane Fox, believed to have a £300million fortune; both of them studied history . 1) Harvard University - 2,964 alumni worth a total of $622bn . 2) University of Pennsylvania - 1,502 alumni worth $242bn . 3) Stanford University - 1,174 alumni worth $171bn . 4) Columbia University - 889 alumni worth $116bn . 5) New York University - 828 alumni worth $110bn . 6) University of Chicago - 658 alumni worth $144bn . 7) Massachusetts Institute of Technology - 581 alumni worth $172bn . 8) Yale University - 568 alumni worth $125bn . 9) Cornell University - 528 alumni worth $60bn . 10) Princeton University - 508 alumni worth $70bn . 11) University of Virginia - 499 alumni worth $31bn . 12) Boston University - 291 alumni worth $38bn . 13) Northwestern University - 451 alumni worth $36bn . 14) University of California, Berkeley - 447 alumni worth $72bn . 15) University of Michigan - 410 alumni worth $70bn . 16) University of Oxford - 401 alumni worth $51bn . 17) University of Southern California - 374 alumni worth $66bn . 18) University of Mumbai - 372 alumni worth $37bn . 19) University of Cambridge - 361 alumni worth $93bn . 20) Brown University - 349 alumni worth $23bn . Previous research has suggested that . the most lucrative subjects to study are medicine, law and engineering, . which all give their students a significant earnings boost over the . course of their careers. The least well-paying degrees are the . arts and humanities - but that did not stop history graduates like Mr . Baron Cohen and Lady Lane Fox from becoming extremely wealthy. The overwhelming majority of 'ultra-high-net-worth individuals' from British universities are male, with just one in 11 of them being women. For Oxford graduates, the situation is even more one-sided - 94 per cent of its super-wealthy alumni are men. Cambridge: Actor Sacha Baron Cohen, a former history student, and beer . mogul Lord Bilimoria, who studied law have both amassed large fortunes - nearly . £70million and as much as £80million respectively . Number three: The London School of Economics has 273 super-rich alumni including singer Mick Jagger, who took courses in business at the university . Number four: Among the 127 multi-millionaires produced by Imperial College London are Queen's Brian May, a noted scientist with a PhD in astrophysics . While . higher education in the UK clearly deserves some of the credit for the . success of its alumni, the average super-rich graduate is well out of . university at the age of 57. Mike Byrne of Wealth-X said the findings showed that future business leaders were still attracted to British universities. '17 out of the 24 Russell Group . universities are featured in the report, which reflects the ability of . such prestigious institutions to attract high-calibre individuals, who . proceed to create financial success,' he said. Despite . the strong showing of many British institutions, the U.S. dominates the . global rich list - Harvard, in top spot, has almost 3,000 graduates . worth more than £20million, nearly twice as many as second-placed Penn. Oxford stands at number 16 in the international list, with Cambridge at number 19. The majority of institutions on the global version of the list are private universities in the U.S., including Ivy League colleges such as Columbia, Yale, Cornell, Princeton and Brown. The only American public universities with more than 350 super-rich alumni are the University of Virginia, the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Michigan. The one entry on the list from outside the U.S. and the UK may be surprising - it is the University of Mumbai, which despite being located in a Third World country has 372 alumni worth more than £20million. The university has long been popular with the children of India's wealthy elite, and its former students include billionaire industrialist Mukesh Ambani and legendary former cricketer Sunil Gavaskar.","Oxford has 401 super-rich graduates but Cambridge has more billionaires .

The BBC has come under fire after it emerged that Songs of Praise is paying skilled singers just £55 per day to perform. Members of a cathedral choir due to be featured on the iconic programme have hit out at the 'insulting' fee being paid for their services. They claim the corporation has previously agreed to pay £214 for a day's singing - more than four times the payment currently being offered. Three episodes of Songs of Praise will be filmed next month at Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff, featuring the 900-year-old church's highly respected professional choir. Outcry: Singers at Llandaff Cathedral, pictured, say they are being underpaid for appearing on Songs of Praise . But its singers have complained that the £110 they will receive for taking part in the two-day filming session is not enough, and have called for the production company which makes the programme to increase the fee. The daily rate of £55 translates into an annual salary of just £14,300, well below the national average wage of £26,500. 'The fee offered to members of the choir for singing in these programmes is £110 - considerably less than the rate agreed between the BBC and my union Equity,' said chorister Adam Poole. 'It seems to me there is an attempt to deprive choir members of the fees they are entitled to.' Fellow choir member Matthew Mudge, who has been singing for 17 years, said: 'The BBC TV agreement with Equity says choir members should be paid £214 for a daily session of up to five hours. 'But the recording is taking place over two days so people should be paid two daily fees. 'I think it's pretty insulting to expect members of the choir to sing for less money than they are entitled to. I can't imagine them expecting the choir of St Paul's Cathedral in London to perform cut-price.' Iconic: Songs of Praise is filmed at a number of notable churches and cathedrals across the UK; a previous edition of the programme is pictured here . The Cardiff episodes of Songs of Praise is being produced by Welsh television production Avanti, and will be screened on BBC One. The choir of Llandaff Cathedral, which has toured around the capitals of Europe, is the only professional Anglican cathedral choir in Wales. Its lay members receive a monthly salary from the diocese in return for performing at six services a week. The dean of the cathedral has insisted that despite singers' protests it would be 'an honour' to host Songs of Praise, and argued that participants should not seek to profit from the recording. 'It is a privilege for Llandaff Cathedral as it allows us to share our worship with millions of viewers across the UK and beyond,' Janet Henderson said. 'It's a low-budget programme and we are not taking part in order to profit financially. 'At present, the form of the programme and the musical items are still being considered and no final decision has been taken about which musicians will be taking part.' A BBC spokesman said: 'The independent production company which is producing this recording for Songs of Praise are still in discussion with the Cathedral about the choir's involvement and the fees involved that will be in line with agreed industry rates.'","BBC One programme will be filmed at Llandaff Cathedral next month .

D-Day veterans have protested after a new French Second World War tourism campaign ignored one of the Normandy beaches where British troops went ashore. Six tourist boards along the Normandy . coast launched the new D-Day initiative to promote what it calls the 'Secteur . mythique' - or mythical sector where action took place. It stretches from Utah and Omaha in the west to Gold and Juno beaches where Allied troops from the U.S., UK and Canada went ashore. Mark of respect: WWII veteran Bill Stoneman (centre), from Newquay in Cornwall, plants a Union Jack flag in the sand on Sword Beach in Hermanville, Normandy, in 2004 . Never forget: Normandy Veteran Eric Buckley, then 85, from Leicester places a wooden remembrance plaque on what was the British Sword beach at Colleville Montgomery on June 5, 2009 near Caen, France . But the campaign stops short of Sword Beach in the east, where 700 British soldiers were killed or wounded on June 6, 1944. Sword Beach was the code name given by . Second World War Allied commanders to one of the five main landing areas . along the Normandy coast during the D-Day landings, or Operation . Overlord as it is sometimes known. It stretches roughly five miles . from Ouistreham to Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer. It was the eastern-most beach of . the Normandy landings. The Allied forces most heavily involved . in the assault on Sword Beach were the British 3rd Infantry Division. Various brigades were attached to the main assault group. Significant, . and emblematic from a French standpoint, was the inclusion of the 1st . Special Service Brigade within which was comprised the Free French . Commandos. From the Allies' point of view, it was . important and highly symbolic that French forces should be included as . part of the D-Day invasion, contributing to the liberation of their own . country. After the initial landings on Sword Beach, British troops moved off the beach and pushed inland towards Caen. Sword was the most easterly of the landing beaches. British troops also landed at beaches codenamed Juno and Gold near Arromanches and Courseulles . A massive flotilla of boats was organised to carry troops across the Channel to Normandy on June 6, 1944 . Omaha Beach secured after D-Day, 1944. The beach where U.S. troops landed is part of the so-called 'Secteur mythique' Juno Beach in Normandy where Allied Forces landed in the Normandy invasion . The website Dday-overlord.com is running a campaign for the French tourist boards to include Sword Beach in their promotion . One of those veterans who went ashore, Royal Artillery signaller Albert Owens, now 88, told of his dismay at the decision. He said: 'A lot lost their lives in that area. It seems to be an insult to their memory to leave them out. If you are going to promote some of the beaches, you should promote them all.' The tourist board decision has also been criticised by the local regional council of Basse-Normandie as well as the French Normandie-Mémoire and D-Day Committee associations. It was a rousing battle cry for British troops about to risk their lives on D-Day. Written . by their commander in chief General Sir Bernard Montgomery, the . stirring words were delivered to tens of thousands of men on the eve of . the Normandy landings in 1944. 'Good luck to each one of you,' he declared. 'And good hunting on the main land of Europe.' General Montgomery instructed unit . commanders to read the words 'to all troops' to inspire them as they . prepared to take on Hitler's military might. On . June 6 some 135,000 Allied soldiers landed on five beaches – codenamed . Juno, Sword, Gold, Omaha and Utah. By the end of the ferocious fighting . on what was immortalised in film as the Longest Day, around 4,000 Allied . troops had been killed – but the invaders had secured a foothold in . Nazi Europe. The rousing speech ends with the poignant line 'Good luck to each one of you. And good hunting on the main land of Europe'. Montgomery also quotes the famous lines of Scottish nobleman and Civil War soldier James Graham: . He either fears his fate too much,Or his deserts are small,That dares not put it to the touch,To gain or lose it all. The latter two D-Day organisations already support tourism and commemorations for all municipalities right along all sectors of the D-Day Normandy beaches, recognising the contribution and sacrifice of troops of all nationalities. They have been remembering D-Day for almost 70 years, 2014 marking the 70th anniversary of the Normandy Landings. Towns associated with Sword Beach have also expressed their strong dissatisfaction with the tourist boards' decision which they say has everything to do with tourism and nothing to do with history. A spokesman for The Battle of Normandy website, DDay-Overlord.com, Marc Laurenceau, slammed the decision, saying: 'With such an initiative, six tourist offices ... develop history tourism without worrying about history. 'What they consider is money. The American sector and the town of Arromanches (included in this so-called 'mythical sector') attract more than 85 per cent of the Battle of Normandy tourists. 'Instead of making an effort on Sword Beach and the Commonwealth drop zones, these six tourist offices just care about the most popular areas. 'What will British and French veterans who landed at La Brèche-d'Hermanville on D-Day think? What will be the thoughts of those who were parachuted northeast of Ranville? 'What about their fallen comrades, killed to free a piece of land that is not considered ""mythical"" enough according to these six tourist offices?' Mr Laurenceau has demanded an urgent re-think by the six Normandy tourist boards involved, calling upon them to cancel the 'Mythical Sector' project as it's presently configured. A petition has also been launched by DDay-Overlord.com calling for the abandonment of what they see as a tourist project disrespectful to the fallen heroes of Sword Beach. This year's general assembly of the . landings organising committee - the Comité du Débarquement - confirmed . the 69th annual D-Day commemoration events will centre on . Vierville-sur-Mer, honouring U.S troops who took part in the D-Day . landings on the adjacent Omaha beach.","Six tourist boards along Normandy .

"By . Charles Walford . UPDATED: . 08:23 EST, 8 December 2011 . Andrew Lansley announced in September that the patient database was being ditched . Taxpayers will have to pay at least a further £2billion towards the failed NHS IT database project even though it has already been scrapped, it has been claimed. The US company behind the technology has apparently informed Wall Street that it expects its contract with the NHS to be extended. This despite Health Secretary Andrew Lansley announcing in September that the national patient database scheme was being abandoned. Francis Maude, Cabinet Offcie Minister  in charge of procurement, said at the time it had 'let down the NHS and wasted taxpayers' money''. But it now appears that cancelling contracts relating to the fiasco could be more expensive than ploughing ahead with it. Computer Sciences Corporation expects an estimated £2billion, despite the company already failing to deliver a fully functional version of its software, The Times reported. The £11.4billion National Programme for IT in the NHS was set up in 2002At the time it was billed as the world’s biggest civilian computerisation project, and aimed to give doctors instant access to patient records, wherever they were being seen. CSC signed a deal to computerise records in most of England. Digitising the medical records of the country’s 62million people was the core objective of the National Programme for IT in the NHS, accounting for £7bn of the total estimated cost. Mr Lansley said he made the decision to 'urgently dismantle' the failed project after criticism it was not value for taxpayers’ money. CSC was tasked with providing a patient database to 166 health trusts in the North, Midlands and East. It has so far failed to delvier a fully operational system. After it failed to hit one of its targets fears grew about its ability to complete the task, and its share prcie dropped. The business is currently being sued by two groups of shareholders in the US for making fraudulent claims about the progress of its NHS work. CSC says it has been given notice of contract default by th NHs, but blames the health service for failures and breaches of contract. A memorandum of undersdtanding between the two anticiaptes a one-year extension to the contract, until June 2017. The Times reports that CSC beleives ministers will honour this  becasue of the risk of being sued for damages and the need to begin a new search for an IT supplier, while also paying CSC to maintain its software. An investigation by The Times into the project fiasco also found that health trusts were threatened with cuts unless they agreed to implement the system and civil servants privately estimated that the software had a 33 per cent chance of being delivered late. Computer applications installed as part of the scheme have also failed or been scrapped. However, £250,000 in bonuses has been . paid by the DoH to 80 people involved in the scheme as a reward for 'an . exceptional contribution to delivery', the newspaper said. The database was meant to allow doctors access to patient records wherever they are in the country . According to the paper, officials also calculated that it would cost nothing to scrap the system if it went wrong. But the Government is now embroiled in a multimillion-pound legal battle with former suppliers and admits that the cost of ending the project may be higher than going ahead. CSC, one of the world’s biggest IT providers, had been contracted to provide patient record software, known as the Lorenzo system, to 166 NHS hospitals. But it has delivered on 10 projects. None of those systems is fully functional. On Wednesday night, the Department of Health admitted that 'negotiations' were ongoing with the company over its NHS contracts, but would not comment further. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said it was 'shameful' to pour more money into a failed initiative. 'There needs to be greater accountability and regular auditing to ensure that money is not being thrown away on wasteful projects.",Government in contract dispute with U.S. technology providers .

They were about the close for the day at 9.30pm on September 17 last year when Green burst in brandishing a gun in front of a terrified female customer. Ironically, the shopkeepers decided not to pull down the shutters to serve him. Mr Umesh, 40, said: 'He came to the door and then fired one or two shots at the sky to show the gun was real and told me to go and get the money. 'He had a bag which he gave to me. No match: As Sheldon Green points the gun at Thurairagh Pirabahuran, the shopkeeper grabs the stool he was sitting on . Take that: Thurairagh Pirabahuran hits the armed raider with the stool he was sitting on . 'There was a lady customer and my colleague served her first and then she just ran.' Mr Umesh said Green approached the counter and told Mr Pirabahuran to hand over money from the till. Mr Umesh said: 'He told my colleague to give him the money but he didn't, he just grabbed the stool and hit him. He was very brave.' Green was finally captured when he stole a phone with a special tracking device application from a woman pedestrian in Hackney. Green was chased on foot which ended with him jumping into a local canal. Det Sgt Neil Turner, of the Met Police's Barking Flying Squad, said: 'There was a foot chase and then Green jumped into the canal. 'They surrounded him and he quite quickly realised his attempt to swim the canal was futile and gave up. 'Officers surrounded him and fished him out.' Green was jailed at London's Old Bailey after he admitted nine robbery and firearms charges. The offender began targeting stores throughout east London and Essex last July in a bid to repay debts to a drug gang, the court heard. Hero: The brave shopkeeper stands up to the gunman and refuses to hand over the cash . Give up: Green was so shocked by Mr Pirabahuran's actions he fled empty-handed . Green rode a high-powered Yamaha motorbike he stole after it was advertised on community forum website Gumtree. Terence Woods, defending, told the judge: 'He went on a crime spree which he explained to police was due to his past catching up with him. 'In May last year the individual that he was in debt to called in the debt. 'That was the trigger for all of his offending last year.' Sentencing him, Judge Rabinder Singh told Green: 'You are, and were, a complete menace to members of the public. You went on a crime rampage. 'Your offending was half-hearted as there was no actual violence used.'","Sheldon Green fired two shots and demanded money from the till .

Daniel Blythe of Wrexham, north Wales, weighed in at 21 stone in 2010 and was given a warning by his doctor to lose weight. But after shedding the pounds and starting weight training he is now competing in bodybuilding championships, something he would never have thought possible just three years earlier. Daniel, from Wrexham, once weighed 21 stone but went down to 12 through eating healthily and dieting. He . is now 14 stone after putting on two stone of muscle in the gym  and . competes in bodybuilding championships . Mr Blythe, 33, said: 'When I was in my early twenties I started my own window cleaning business which became quite successful. 'I started to sit back in the office and became lazy. Mr Blythe, 33, said: 'When my window cleaning business became successful I started to sit back in the office and became lazy' 'I wasn't going to the gym or anything and I was eating really bad food. 'I would have three or four takeaways a week such as pizzas and kebabs. 'I reached 21 and a half stone.' In 2010, Daniel took a trip to the doctor and was told to lose weight. It was the incentive he needed to change his lifestyle - and his diet - for good. 'I went to the doctors and he told me I needed to lose weight for the good of my health. 'It really was a kick up the backside,' added Daniel. Daniel said that while he looked at holiday photos and saw a large man looking back at him, he never saw himself as quite the weight he really was. 'I didn't see myself as 21 stone,' Daniel confesses now. 'When I looked back at pictures of myself on holiday I thought: ""I need to lose weight"".' Daniel stopped eating fat-laden takeaways in the evening. Instead of spending time on the sofa, he started going to the gym, initially to lose weight and get back into shape, but later to build muscle and change his shape. He started spending every morning and evening in the gym, focusing mainly on cardiovascular work. After losing nine stone of excess fat Daniel began to start weight training and went up to 14 stone - adding on two stone of muscle - and that is where his weight has settled now. Mr Blythe says he looks back at holiday photos and realises he was overweight . 'It was really hard and took a lot of getting used to, but now I've gone from one extreme to the other,' he said. 'I feel a lot fitter and a lot more confident and I don't get tired just walking up the stairs anymore. 'I'm 33 but I feel better now than I ever did in my twenties.' Daniel is still the owner of DSB Cleaning Services in Wrexham, but now leads a healthier lifestyle with his partner Kayleigh Pickup and his 15-year-old son Connor Arrowsmith. He recently competed in the Strong Seniors Class at the North West Bodybuilding Championships where he finished fourth. He now says that he has plans to compete in many more competitions in the future. Daniel puts his success down to Craig Hughes, the owner of Valhalla Gym where he works out daily. He said: 'I have to thank Craig and the gym for all the help they have given me. 'Without Craig this wouldn't have happened, he really helped me with my diet and regime.' Mr Hughes, who has worked as a nutritionist in the Wrexham area for 20 years said: 'It is a fantastic change. 'To lose nine stone is one thing, but to transform two stone of that into muscle is really hard to do. 'All the lads in the gym are shocked.'","Daniel Blythe, 33, weighed in at an obese 21 stone three years ago .

A man disappeared Sunday afternoon following a 12 kilometer race and now the only signs of him are the personal effects found mysteriously on the beach later that night. Beau Rasmussen of Oakland, California ran the San Francisco Bay area’s Bay to Breakers race the morning of May 19 and then decided to go for a swim. The 27-year-old parted ways with friends around noon to go for a swim at Golden Gate Park’s Ocean Beach. Disappeared: Beau Rasmussen, 27, ran a 12K Sunday then parted with friends to swim at Ocean Beach in San Francisco and only his belongings have been seen since . He hasn’t been seen since. On Sunday night, a passerby found Rasmussen’s passport, credit card, and cell phone—along with a baseball cap and sunglasses—near the Beach Chalet Brewery and Restaurant. That person redialled the last outgoing call, putting him in touch with one of Rasmussen’s co-workers. The next day, Monday, he didn’t show up to work and a missing persons report was filed. His concerned colleagues also combed the beach themselves Monday. They reached out to area jails and hospitals and asked lifeguards if they’d seen anyone matching Rasmussen’s description. Ominous: Rasmussen's belongings, seen here, were found at San Francisco's Ocean Beach, where he told friends he was going to swim . Nothing bore fruit. So, on Tuesday, Rasmussen’s stepmother Nicole Apelian travelled from the Portland area to the San Francisco Bay to lead a search for her stepson Tuesday. And from what she told KTVU, she has reason to be concerned. ‘The last he was seen was Sunday at noon,’ Apelian told the Fox affiliate. ‘I texted him at 6 that night and it was really weird he didn’t get back to me. He always gets back to me right away.’ Apelian said it was typical for Rasmussen to go for a solitary swim after a race, but less in character for him to disappear thereafter. Typical? Rasmussen's stepmother Nicole Apelian traveled from Portland to help search for her stepson Tuesday. She said going for a swim was common for the avid outdoorsman . ‘That’s something he would normally do. He’s a big strong guy. He works out every day. He’s a backpacker, he’s a hiker. Its not unusual that he would go for a swim after,’ said Apelian, whose husband—Rasmussen’s father—and sons stayed back in Portland. ‘It’s been really emotional, we just want beau back,’ she said, fighting back tears. Co-workers and friends were joined Tuesday by Apelian, who said Rasmussen’s concerned employers even shut down operation for the day. Dangerous: Rasmussen left friends to swim here, at San Francisco's Ocean Beach, where warnings of dangerous riptides often keep even experienced swimmers out of the water .

The mother of a 13-year-old West Texas cheerleader whose body was found in March more than two years after she first went missing, has spoken about her concerns that her ex-boyfriend may have been involved in her daughter’s death. Speaking for the first time since her daughter’s remain were found, Billie Jean Dunn said she had spent the past two years fearing the worst, including that the girl was chained and tortured or had fallen victim to human traffickers. Hailey Darlene Dunn was reported missing by her mom in December 2010 in Colorado City, about 250 miles west of Dallas. Hailey Darlene Dunn (left), seen here with her mother and her mother's boyfriend, went missing three days after this Christmas picture was taken in 2010 . Remains found in March near at a West Texas lake about 20 miles away were identified last month as belonging to Hailey. In . the first public comments since Hailey's remains were identified, . Billie Jean Dunn said possibly the most painful part was picturing her . daughter wondering why her mother and father hadn't found her. ‘I . kept my hope the whole time. I did,’ the 36-year-old mother said. ‘That . fear that she was dead, I put it way in the back of my mind.’ No arrests have been made. Shortly . after her disappearance, police called Dunn's live-in boyfriend at the . time, Shawn Adkins, a person of interest, but he has not been charged. Hailey Darlene Dunn's remains were found in March near a West Texas lake about 20 miles away from where she disappeared in December 2010 . Dunn and Adkins split up early last year and last had email contact in August. ‘I've . learned a lot over the past few months and I feel pretty strongly that . he could be involved,’ she said. ‘I know there are other possibilities . also.’ Adkins has denied involvement in Hailey's disappearance. . From the start, Dunn said, her worry was that a ‘random weirdo’ might have pulled off nearby Interstate 20 and abducted Hailey. ‘Things you don't think of normally just run through your mind, like what is somebody doing to her, what is she having to live through,’ said Dunn, who works as an administrative assistant in Austin. Mother Billie Jean Dunn, right, and other family members grieve the teenager's loss during a public memorial service Sunday at Colorado Middle School in Colorado City, Texas . ‘That would just worry me sick. That would really drive me crazy.’ Dunn's attorney, John Young, said authorities have told him investigators are looking at ‘other cases that may in fact be related or may be the same type to the very specific facts of this case.’ Dunn said it's ‘absurd’ for people to question her having anything to do with her daughter's disappearance or death. ‘That question has always disgusted me,’ she said. ‘It still does. This is my daughter. Hailey is my baby. She is my child.’ Hailey's brother, 18-year-old David Dunn, is ‘very angry and very sad,’ his mom said. He sobbed throughout a memorial service held Sunday at Hailey's middle school where hundreds came to bid farewell to the girl. Hailey's brother, 18-year-old David sobbed throughout a memorial service held Sunday at his sister's middle school . Police found Dunn's remains near Lake J.B. Thomas in west Texas but they have yet released a manner and cause of death . ‘He couldn't stand the sight of a “missing” poster (about Hailey), of course, because it made it too real for him,’ Billie Jean Dunn said. ‘Now it's real and now he accepts it.’ Officials have not released a manner and cause of death. Dunn said authorities still have Hailey's remains, which she plans to cremate once they're turned over to the family. ‘They're being very meticulous,’ Dunn said of forensic experts. ‘They're doing everything they know that they need to do to collect any possible evidence.’ Dunn said that while she got some answers from finally knowing where Hailey is, she ‘won't have full closure unless there's been an arrest made.'

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 09:26 EST, 17 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:49 EST, 17 May 2013 . A remote Alaskan volcano continues to erupt, spewing lava and ash clouds - highlighting concerns over the closure of geological observation centers in the area. The Alaska Volcano Observatory said a continuous cloud of ash, steam and gas from Pavlof Volcano has been seen 20,000 feet above sea level. John Power, the U.S. Geological Survey scientist in charge at the observatory, estimates the lava fountain rose several hundred feet into the air. Spewing lava: Fiery red molten rock can be seen erupting from Pavlof volcano, observed here from Cold Bay . Seismic instruments are picking up constant tremors from the eruption at Pavlof, located about 625 miles (1,000 kilometers) southwest of Anchorage. Residents of Cold Bay, 37 miles (60 kilometers) away, have reported seeing a glow from the summit. Pavlof is among the most active volcanoes in the Aleutian arc, with nearly 40 known eruptions, according to the observatory. It comes as scientists monitoring Alaska's volcanoes are forced to shut down stations that provide real-time tracking . of eruptions and forgo repairs of seismic equipment amid ongoing federal . budget cuts - moves that could mean delays in getting vital information . to airline pilots and emergency planners. The Alaska Volcano Observatory can . no longer seismically monitor five volcanoes with real-time equipment to . detect imminent eruptions. Such . equipment is especially important in helping pilots receive . up-to-the-minute warnings about spewing ash that can cause engine . failures and other problems. Under threat: Some Alaskan volcano observation units have had to be closed due to federal budget cuts. They often warn aircraft in the area of any possible dangerous ash clouds . Alaska has 52 active volcanoes, with many of them located on the Aleutians Islands along international air routes between Europe, North America and Asia. Pavlof Volcano is one of several dozen volcanoes that make up the Aleutian Arc. The arc stretches across the Alaskan Peninsula in the south-west of Alaska to north-eastern Siberia, 3,000km away. It follows the line where the pacific tectonic plate meets the North American plate. Alaska Airlines officials said the observatory, funded by the U.S. Geological Survey, provides a crucial service, including early warnings of seismic changes that may portend an impending eruption. Monitors need to be operating all the time, not just during major eruptions, said Betty Bollert, an Alaska Airlines dispatcher. 'I think the public gets kind of . complacent when nothing exciting is happening and think, ""Oh, why should . we throw money at that?""' said Bollert, who was on duty in 1989 when . the Redoubt Volcano blew 115 miles from Anchorage. Following . that eruption, several aircraft experienced damage from ash - including . a Boeing 747-400 carrying 231 passengers that lost all four engines . after flying into an ash cloud. The . plane dropped more than two miles in five minutes before the crew was . able to restart the engines and land safely in Anchorage. Worldwide, . hundreds of flights are diverted each year because of volcanic . activity. In 2010, an eruption in Iceland spread debris over Northern . Europe, threatening most flight routes from the East Coast to Europe, . and within Europe itself. Early warning: The steam and the fresh lava flow could be seen on the north side of the volcano on Monday . The Alaska volcano monitoring system, first created in 1988, is intended to help pilots avoid such problems. But it has regressed over the past few years because of shrinking finances, and now the across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration are further squeezing operations. For example, gone is a plan to install seismic monitors at Cleveland Volcano, a remote mountain on an uninhabited island in the Aleutians. The volcano experienced a low-level eruption earlier this month that continues to discharge steam, gas and heat, although no ash clouds have been detected in the past week. 'Because our budget has been declining for so long, we have no hope of actually addressing the Cleveland eruption in the way that it really should be,' said geophysicist John Power, the USGS scientist in charge at the Alaska Volcano Observatory. Pavlof Volcano, 625 miles from Anchorage, does have seismic instruments, which picked up tremors signaling a possible eruption. Satellite imagery also showed a lot of heat in the mountain. Cloud: The volcano continued to pump out gas and steam on Tuesday - with the eruption still continuing Friday . In Alaska, 32 volcanoes once had 200 working seismic instruments. Now 80 of those instruments have fallen into disrepair and can't be fixed due to the USGS budget cuts. That means five of those volcanoes aren't monitored electronically at all, and the number could rise if more instruments go without maintenance. Cuts also have reduced the number of days helicopter crews can fly to repair equipment in remote locations, from 140 days in 2008 to 36. The observatory still uses satellite data, infrasound and reports from pilots and others to detect eruptions. But none of those offer real-time information. Sound waves were picked up the Cleveland eruption, but it took 40 minutes for the data to reach scientists in Anchorage, 940 miles northeast of the volcano. These days, the observatory is operating on $4million annually, roughly half of its heyday budget. Four other observatories in the U.S. - in Wyoming, California, Washington and Hawaii - also have faced cuts, leading to a reduction in lab research, studies of eruption histories and lava survey flights. In Hawaii, lava flyovers of the Big Island's Kilauea volcano were reduced from once a week to once every two weeks. It's still early in the federal downsizing process, and resources already are spread thin, said Tom Murray, chief of the five USGS observatories. And while these types of cuts may not be immediately felt by the public - unlike the furloughs of air traffic controllers that caused flight delays nationwide - they are just as damaging, he said. 'The challenges with what we do is that it doesn't happen all the time,' he said. 'But when it does happen, then the ramifications can be very large.'","Pavlof Volcano has been spewing ash, steam, lava and gas since Monday .

As Daniel Reilly, 36, awaited sentencing Monday for having sex with his 13-year-old student as recently as a month ago, he was seen unabashedly making out with his wife. The former marine and his attorney wife Annemarie, 28, were seen making out and caressing in the courtroom’s fourth row of seats as a judge was seated just feet away. Strange: Just prior to being sentenced for repeatedly raping a 13-year-old student in his marital bed, Daniel Reilly was seen making out with wife Annemarie in court . That’s according to the New York Post, which said the couple ‘shared long, passionate kisses’ as Annemarie ‘rubbed his knee and held his hand.’ They would also be photographed holding hands inside the courthouse that day. The two need not have been so desperate for each other’s affections. Reilly would subsequently receive only four months in jail for his crimes, which could have won him seven years under New York law. Case closed: Seen here in April, Reilly, 36, has now been convicted of raping his former 6th grade student while attorney wife Annemarie remains committed to their marriage . He also received ten years probation, however, and will be forced to attend 104 sex offender classes.

Sisto conducted his first Mass in the chapel on August 1483. The Sistine Chapel is most famous for Michelangelo’s frescoes, but long before Michelangelo, Sisto commissioned painters such as Botticelli to fresco the two long walls of the chapel. One side told the story of Moses, the other the story of Christ. Even without Michelangelo’s work, these earlier paintings still represent one of Europe’s greatest fresco cycles. Michelangelo began work on the ceiling in July 1508. The completed frescoes were unveiled in October 1512.","Official guides have threatened to go on strike if security is not improved .

Helmeted rescue workers have been searching tirelessly for survivors and victims, and officials said Tuesday they planned to keep going - sometimes double- and triple-checking home sites. Officials were not certain of how many homes were destroyed or how many families had been displaced. Emergency crews had trouble navigating devastated neighborhoods because there were no street signs left. Some rescuers used smartphones or GPS devices to guide them through areas with no recognizable landmarks.

'I'm 98 percent sure we're good,' Bird said.

Complaints: Joan Woolard, 75, who had travelled from Lincolnshire, earned applause from the audience as she slammed the bank's pay policies . It had to be said and yesterday a widow from a small market town was the one to say it. Venting the fury of a nation, Joan Woolard accused the millionaire bosses of Barclays of being ‘greedy bastards’. The 75-year-old had travelled all the way from Spalding in rural Lincolnshire to the bank’s annual meeting in London to condemn the City’s bonus culture. Mrs Woolard lambasted Barclays directors for dishing out seven-figure pay packages and demanded to know why no bankers had been jailed. Mocking the new Barclays motto – ‘the go-to bank’ – she added: ‘Go-to? Go to hell Barclays! A lot of people regard Barclays and its board as a bunch of crooks. ‘My income is £726 a month. I live quite well on that – I don’t understand why anyone needs a million, even to live in London. ‘Anyone who asks for more than that is a greedy bastard – pardon my French. ‘Banks have brought us down – brought the entire global economy down. Yet none of you have gone to jail. ‘I don’t understand how you can sleep at night.’ The emotional speech was greeted by applause from her fellow shareholders in the audience at the Royal Festival Hall. Many were pensioners whose incomes have been decimated since the 2008 financial crash.

Another pensioner, who described . himself as a customer and a shareholder for many years, told the . meeting: ‘We have suffered. Ordinary staff have suffered. But many who . have received big bonuses haven’t suffered.’ And Jennifer Cramer, a small investor, said talk of pay restraint at previous annual meetings had been a sham. John Mann, a Labour MP who sits on . the Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘Mrs Woolard speaks for England. The public is at a loss as to why bankers have got away with it. The . fact that they also continue to award huge bonuses shows they have not . learned their lessons.’ Sir David Walker, who took over last year as chairman to help restore the bank’s sullied reputation, responded to Mrs Woolard. Unhappy: Protesters demonstrate in a bath tub outside the Barclays AGM at the Royal Festival Hall in London . He said: ‘It’s important to – with . humility and modesty – recognise the extent to which those comments were . recognised and approved of by others in the audience. I readily agree . that Barclays overpaid in the past – it’s not going there again.’ Chief executive Antony Jenkins . yesterday admitted the bank had ‘let our customers and clients, our . shareholders, our colleagues and the wider public down’. Despite claims it is showing wage restraint, Barclays has infuriated investors by paying 428 staff more than £1million. Last month it came under fire for . trying to bury details of a £40million jackpot shared between nine . directors by announcing it on Budget day. This included a £17.6million shares . jackpot for the flamboyant Rich Ricci, who has become the focus of . criticism of fat cat pay at Barclays since the departure of chief . executive Bob Diamond. The payouts extended to a £5.3million shares windfall from bonuses awarded in previous years to Mr Jenkins. Yesterday’s drama comes a year after . the so-called ‘Shareholder Spring’ of 2012 which saw a wave of investor . protests against lavish boardroom pay. Some leading executives were . forced to quit their lucrative roles in the wake of the revolts. Among . them was David Brennan, then chief executive of drugs giant AstraZeneca.

Her complaints were dismissed by both Barclays and the Financial Ombudsman. This prompted her to buy £10 of shares to allow her to attend the bank’s annual meeting, at which she laid into Mr Diamond. Her protest forced Barclays to change . its policy to allow 30 days of grace for secondary card holders to use . an account following a death. Despite yesterday’s protests the bank . managed to avoid a repeat of last year when 32 per cent of shareholders . failed to back its pay awards.","Joan Woolard of Lincolnshire slammed pay policies at London meeting .

AWOL: U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer 1st Class Russell Matthews admitted to desertion, saying he spent three months camping in the mountains of Oahu and didn't plan on ever returning to his job . A Coast Guard rescue swimmer whose disappearance led to a large-scale search in Hawaii pleaded guilty to desertion Tuesday, saying he left work one day, decided never to return and spent the next three months camping in the mountains of Oahu. Petty Officer 1st Class Russell Matthews pleaded guilty to desertion and wrongful use of marijuana during a special court-martial in Honolulu on Tuesday before a Coast Guard judge. In exchange for his guilty plea, the Coast Guard dismissed charges of being absent without leave and causing the Coast Guard to conduct a search when there was no need. ‘Your honor, I left work and I didn't have any intention of going back,’ he testified, describing how he went to pick up his children from school on October 25 and then got into argument with his wife. He then drove to Kaena Point, a remote part of Oahu, and walked on the beach for several hours. Afterward, he camped in the mountains behind his kids' school, he said, where he stayed until he showed up at his wife's home in mid-January. ‘That's a long time to be camping,’ said Coast Guard Cmdr. Kevin Bruen, the judge presiding over the court-martial. ‘How did you sustain yourself?’ ‘I had $20 in my pocket,’ Matthews said softly, seated at the defense table, flanked by his appointed Navy lawyers and wearing his service dress blues. ‘I did some... stuff I try not to remember.’ Members of the Coast Guard who participated in the search that scoured more than 10,000 square miles testified about the motivation to find one of their own, the speculation he may have tried to kill himself and then the mixed emotions that came when he turned up alive. Pilots flew 64 hours scouring the waters off Kaena Point, taking Coast Guard members away from their normal duties and taxing aircraft. Without a trace: Matthews' car was left at the remote Kaena Point in Oahu three months ago . Happy family: Matthews pictured with his first wife, Clara, and their two young children . ‘He's part of our unit...we are . family,’ said Cmdr. Prince Neal. Rescuers mourned his loss, only to find . out he was alive. They felt happiness for his children, but also . confusion, Neal recalled. Lt. j.g. Curtis Gookin recalled . searching for four days through rough ocean conditions, holding out hope . they could recover his body and bring some solace to his family. When he surfaced months later, ‘I was really disgusted by his actions,’ he said. Robert Coster, a civilian . search-and-rescue coordinator, testified that the estimated cost of the . search for the Coast Guard was more than $1million. The scenario Coster thought of during . the search was that a well-trained rescue swimmer went into the ocean . to commit suicide, changed his mind and was fighting the ocean to . survive. ‘This was an individual who was well-trained by the Coast Guard,’ Coster said. ‘He understood what we were doing for him.’ Matthews didn't discuss more about . his time in the wilderness, only saying he simply went back to where he . lived and realized his wife and children had moved. The memories of what happened next . are sketchy, he said, recalling that paramedics were called because he . had a cut on his head and he ended up in police custody. He admitted smoking marijuana in . September and smoking several times during his desertion. ‘I smoked it . in a joint, your honor,’ he testified. ‘Probably a few times, your . honor.’ Tragedy: Clara and her children were involved in a head-on bicycling accident in 2009 and the mother suffered a traumatic brain injury; two years later, she committed suicide . Matthews' mother testified via telephone from the mainland that she was told he drowned, but she didn't believe it. ‘He would never do that to his . children,’ Carol Matthews said. ‘I told them at the time I believed my . son was AWOL.’ She said she told the Coast Guard he was likely in Puerto . Rico or in the caves of Pupukea, on the north shore of Oahu. Hawaii News Now previously reported that Matthews lost four colleagues in a 2008 helicopter crash. Under investigation: Matthews, pictured before his disappearance, was under investigation for alleged marijuana use . The following year, his first wife . was critically hurt when she was hit head-on by a car while riding her . bike. She died a couple of years later, according to public records. Coast Guard attorneys prosecuting the case said his two sons are in the custody of his first wife's sister on the mainland. Matthews was in the process of being . discharged from the Coast Guard for illegal use of marijuana when he . disappeared in October. The 36-year-old showed up at his home in mid-January. Police said Matthews was incoherent when he was found, and he taken to a hospital for observation. The . Coast Guard later took him into custody and had him confined at a Navy . brig while they investigated why he left without authorization. Police . had found Matthews' car abandoned at Kaena Point, a remote area of Oahu . next to the ocean, after his wife reported him missing. Loss: Clara Matthews suffered a traumatic brain injury following the accident and took her life two years later . Treatment: The petty officer is now being evaluated at Tripler Army Medical Center . Police at the time described him as . emotionally distraught after losing his ex-wife and colleagues, and said . his friends and family were concerned for his welfare. 'In Petty Officer Matthews' case, we . certainly empathize with his situation, but we certainly do not condone . his actions,' Chief Warrant Officer Gene Maestas said last month. Search and rescue crews scoured more than 10,000 square miles looking for Matthews. Honolulu firefighters sent a helicopter and rescue teams to searches the rugged coastline and sand dunes near Kaena Point. Matthews joined the Coast Guard in 1997. He's been stationed at Air Station Barbers Point on Oahu for five years.

A newlywed mentally disabled couple forced to live apart after their respective care homes deemed them 'incapable' of cohabitation may soon be able to move in together. Since Paul Forziano, 30, and Hava Samuels, 36, got married in April they have been living three miles apart in Long Island, New York. But according to court papers, the couple have been offered an apartment in a group home for the mentally disabled in Riverhead, Long Island, run by East End Disability Associates. Heartbreaking: Paul Farziano and Hava Samuels tied the knot last month, but haven't been allowed to live together because their respective care homes do not permit married couples . The apartment is attached to a group home housing eight others with similar disabilities. 'Seeing the apartment was a thrill for them,' Forziano's mother, Roseann Forziano, told Newsday. The couple had launched a lawsuit after being told they wouldn't be allowed to share a bedroom by the state-sanctioned nonprofits that ran the group homes they currently live in. Forziano said East End Disability Associates has been more open than the previous facilities the couple tried to occupy, and seems eager to help the newlyweds. 'They’re a little more progressive, they’re a little more flexible, they have a better attitude towards change,' Forziano said. She believes being able to live together like any other couple will help their development and progression. The look of love: From July the couple will live together in their own apartment at a home for the mentally disabled . 'He will be living in a new situation as a married man 24/7 which I think is going to be great for them,' Forziano said. 'They’ve both grown very much from their relationship and I think being able to live together in a normal setting like a married couple will also continue to help them reach their potential.' Samuels' mother, Bonnie, had previously said she never . envisioned her daughter would ever be married, let alone become . embroiled in a legal fight over it. 'It does make me very angry,' she . said, 'that people say they want the best and the most for these . individuals, or want them to have the type of life that they would like . to have and let them grow as much as they can, and yet they're being . told no.' The couple had been considering marriage for three years before tying the knot in April. The couple's parents, also plaintiffs in the case, said they have been seeking a solution to the problem of where the couple would live since 2010. 'It's not something we wanted to do, it's something we had to do,' said Samuels, the mother of the bride. Perfect match: The couple met several years ago while attending a performing arts education program . The lawsuit claimed that Forziano's facility refused because people requiring the services of a group home are by definition incapable of living as married people, and it says Samuels' home refused because it believes she doesn't have the mental capacity to consent to sex. A spokeswoman for the Catholic Health . Systems, which runs the Maryhaven Center of Hope, declined to . comment, citing pending litigation. Maryhaven has 2,000 clients, ranging . in age from five to 80, in facilities across Long Island. The facility . in Manorville where Samuels lives is for women only. David Arntsen, attorney for the . Independent Group Home Living program in Manorville, where Forziano . lives, said it didn't have facilities for married residents and there was no specific legal requirement forcing the home to house . them. The program's residences have between three and 12 men and women; the home where Forziano lives is coed, according to his attorney. The lawsuit cites a letter from the director of program services at Independent Group Home Living, saying its homes 'are not staffed or designed to house and supervise married couples or assist married couples with the dynamics of their relationships, sexual or otherwise.' Mr Forziano is classified in the mild to moderate range of intellectual functioning, with recent IQ scores of 50 and 58. He has limited reading and writing skills and cannot manage money. The couple currently spend their days together in the performing arts education center where they met and with their families . Ms Samuels is in the moderate range of intellectual functioning, with recent IQ scores of 50 and 44. She . has a significant expressive language disability, which can make it . difficult sometimes for others to understand her. The Social Security . Administration offers disability benefits when a person's IQ is below . 70. The couple met several years ago while attending the performing arts education program for mentally disabled adults, which teaches the basics of staging and set design, and offers singing and acting lessons. 'She's very beautiful and she helps me,' Forziano says of his new bride, adding, 'We're very sad when we leave each other... I want to live with my wife, because I love her.' Samuels says she fell for her future husband because he was funny; she particularly liked his 'knock-knock' jokes. But her eyes begin to well up with tears when asked about her current living situation. 'I'm not happy,' she says. 'We live apart.' They spend their days together in the performing arts education center where they met.","Paul Forziano and Hava Samiels got married in April .

"By . Tim Shipman and John Stevens . PUBLISHED: . 18:26 EST, 8 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:35 EST, 9 April 2013 . Ed Miliband faced a growing crisis over welfare yesterday as leading Labour figures backed calls for the party to adopt a tougher stance on benefits. At least seven of his MPs – including his own parliamentary aide and members of the Shadow Cabinet – said Labour cannot be the party of people ‘languishing on benefits’. They spoke out as Mr Miliband launched Labour’s local election campaign yesterday, which denounced the Government’s attempts to rein in welfare  spending as ‘heartless and hopeless’. Challenge: Ed Miliband has faced calls from at least seven MPs to back a tougher stance on welfare, including comments from Simon Danczuk, right, who used an article to call on the Labour leader to change his stance . However, there is growing concern among Labour MPs that Mr Miliband’s blanket opposition to every attempt to trim state handouts has left the party on the wrong side of public opinion. A YouGov poll yesterday showed that 80 per cent of voters think that benefit payments are too  high – including 51 per cent of Labour’s own supporters. Outlining his views on the issue in an article published online yesterday, Labour MP Simon Danczuk led the calls for Mr Miliband to change his approach. He said: ‘Seeing people that are capable of working languish for years on benefits is not something the Left should be proud of. ‘It’s something we should be fighting. Otherwise why call ourselves the Labour Party?’ ‘Far too many people tell  me they feel their taxes  are “wasted” on welfare largesse and these voices cannot be ignored.’ ‘If welfare is to be targeted more efficiently at those who need it then we have to condemn those who abuse the system.’ ‘The Labour Party is a moral crusade or it is nothing, said Harold Wilson. It’s time this sense of crusading zeal was applied to helping people off benefits. Seeing people that are capable of working languish for years on benefits is not something the Left should be proud  of. It’s something we should be fighting.’ ‘The Left has to accept there are some people on the dole that don’t want  to work, and we need to  have a plan to get them  into work.’ Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale . Earlier, the MP had tweeted that ‘simply complaining about cuts to benefits is easy, comfy, cosy politics which doesn’t help anyone’. Labour MPs who mostly represent working-class constituencies then used Twitter to show their support for his calls by endorsing Mr Danczuk’s article. Ian Austin, a former aide to Gordon Brown who is now a Labour frontbencher on work and pensions, tweeted: ‘Completely right to say people left “for years on benefits  not something Left should be  proud of”.’ Labour’s international development spokesman Ivan Lewis and Mr Miliband’s parliamentary private secretary Jonathan Reynolds retweeted a link to Mr Danczuk’s article, as did rising star Gloria De Piero, another frontbencher. Chesterfield MP Toby Perkins called it a ‘strong’ article, while Scunthorpe MP Nic Dakin hailed it as an ‘excellent contribution to the welfare debate’, adding: ‘It’s time to hear new voices grounded in experience.’ Former Labour general secretary Peter Watt said it was evidence of ‘sanity on welfare’. By contrast, Mr Miliband yesterday took aim at the Government’s plans for welfare reform. He also accused David Cameron and George Osborne of ‘exploiting’ the case of child killer Mick  Philpott last week when they condemned how the benefits system allowed him to milk £60,000 out of the state each year after fathering  17 children. Mr Miliband said: ‘Here’s the problem with this Government – they are not just heartless, they are hopeless too. Support: Ian Austin, left, and Toby Perkins appeared to back Mr Danczuk's comments in the article . ‘Do you try and unite the country and . bring it together, or do you exploit tragedy, like the Philpott . tragedy, and the right place for him is behind bars. Talking tough: Liam Byrne had called for a return to the contributory principle in comments at the weekend . ‘Of course there are a minority of people on benefits who should be working and are not. ‘Labour is the party that is going to get them back to work. But what I’m not going to do is engage in nasty, divisive politics. ‘If people want that nasty, divisive politics, then you have got the Conservative Party – you’re not going to get it from me.’ But shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne sought to talk tough on the issue at the weekend. He called for a return to the contributory principle under which those who have worked for years get more generous benefits than those who have not. He also suggested the jobless should go to the back of the queue for council housing. But those proposals began to unravel within hours, with Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman stressing that the plans were only ideas for ‘discussion’ and were  not party policy. Former Labour welfare reform minister Frank  Field said the party faced a huge  challenge on the subject, adding: ‘We have been here before, and we ducked it before. ‘The real question is, as Labour now moves up towards the general election, are we going to have an alternative.’","Seven MPs say Labour cannot be the party of people 'languishing on benefits .

A retired U.S. Marine whose injuries in Afghanistan have left him partially paralyzed filed a lawsuit claiming that he got a head injury and was soaked in his own urine after being mistreated by personnel at O'Hare International Airport. Sgt Joseph Smith, a 21-year Army veteran was attacked during his fourth tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2004, leaving him wheelchair-bound for life, according to his wife, Deborah. Smith, 42, has filed a $300,000 negligence suit against Air Serv Corporation and United Airlines, claiming that an employee of the former carelessly dumped him out of his wheelchair at O'Hare in November 2010 after failing to heed his warning that one of the wheels got stuck. Grievances: Retired Sgt Joseph Smith, a partially paralyzed former U.S. Marine, is suing an airline and airport workers after claiming that he was mistreated at O'Hare Airport in 2010 . Mishandled: Smith was traveling to a shooting completion with a Paralympic team when an Air Serv worker allegedly tossed him from his wheelchair after one of the wheels got stuck . On November 17, 2010, the veteran, who was part of a Paralympic shooting team called Semper Fi, was traveling from Colorado to North Carolina to attend a competition. Smith was trying to make a connecting flight when he claims an Air Serv worker tasked with helping disabled flyers tossed him out of his wheelchair when one of the front wheels became wedged between the plane and the jetway ramp, leaving Smith dizzy and bleeding from the head, according to the High Point Enterprise. Smith claims when he boarded the other flight, he was denied an aisle chair used to take handicapped travelers down tight airplanes aisles. Instead, he was forced to drag his 'limp body' to his seat in the seventh row unassisted, which he says caused his catheter bag to burst, soaking him with his own urine. The Paralympian said he got no help from the cabin crew and ended up sitting in his urine for the duration of the two-hour flight. High-flying drama: Smith said United Airlines workers refused to give him an aisle chair to take him to his seat, and he had to drag his body down the aisle, which caused his catheter bag to burst . Humiliating: The veteran said he received not assistance from United personnel was was left sitting in his own urine for the entire two-hour flight . ‘I had urine all over me, so I tried covering myself up,’ Smith recalled. ‘People were staring at me – it was humiliating.’ Smith said he arrived in Colorado Springs with a headache and spent the better part of two days in a hospital where he was diagnosed with a severe concussion. On his return flight, which also took Smith through O’Hare, the 42-year-old said executives from United, Air Serv and the airport attempted to get him to sign some document, but he refused. In the years since the incident, the companies in question offered to settle with Smith for $20,000, but he said it was not enough even to cover his hospital bill. Pressure: Smith said executives from O'Hare, Air Serv and United tried to get him to sign some document and offered a $20,000 settlement, but he refused . Legal action: Smith's lawsuit alleges negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium . United spokesperson Christen David said in an email to the Chicago Sun-Times, ‘Our preliminary review does not corroborate Mr Smith’s version of events.’ Smith said the lawsuit alleging negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium has to do with dignity, not payoff. ‘I’ve been in a war, and if (United and Air Serv) want a war, we can go to war,’ the 42-year-old veteran said. ‘Money is not what this is about. It’s about getting things changed for the disabled, because I don’t want this to ever happen to anybody else.’","Retired Sgt Joseph Smith is suing Air Serv and United Airlines for the November 2010 incident .

This is the moment a traffic warden slapped £70 parking tickets on two minibuses carrying disabled children after they raised hundreds of pounds for a homeless charity by singing in a carol concert. The youngsters, many in wheelchairs, were being lifted into two specially-adapted ambulances in Nottingham when the enforcement officer wrote out two penalty notices before walking away. The twelve children from Oak Field School and Sports College in Bilborough, Nottinghamshire, were returning from the concert on Monday afternoon which raised £370 when they were hit with the fines. Caught on camera: The youngsters, many in wheelchairs, were being lifted into two specially-adapted ambulances in Nottingham when the enforcement officer wrote out two penalty notices before walking away . Disgusted Christmas shoppers watched the scene as the officer stuck tickets on the windscreens of the two minibuses, which were parked in a city centre loading bay to let the children board . Witness Shelley Mawby said a group of onlookers tried to reason with the warden and asked him to show leniency, but he refused to back down and told them he had no choice but to issue the tickets. She said: ‘A group of people gathered and were as shocked as me. When confronted, the warden said “I'm just doing my job”. It was unbelievable.’ Office worker Wayne Rogers added: ‘I took the images from my place of work as I was so disgusted with the action of this person. I was not the only one and several other passers-by took pictures.’ Ticket: Disgusted Christmas shoppers watched the scene as the officer stuck tickets on the windscreens of the two minibuses, which were parked in a city centre loading bay to let the children board . Headteacher David Stewart slammed the warden for his lack of insensitivity and said public transport was not an option for the school as there were too many wheelchairs to fit on one bus. 'A group of people gathered and were as shocked as me. When confronted, the warden said “I'm just doing my job”. It was unbelievable' Shelley Mawby, witness . He said: ‘It's the irony of it. The youngsters had all gone carol singing to raise money for Emmanuel House - which the city council has cut funding from - and then they ended up with a £140 fine. ‘These children are also wheelchair users so trying to get them anywhere in the city is difficult so it does take time. ‘An able-bodied person could be in and out of a bus in a second but we have to lift the wheelchair in and then make sure it's clamped, which is what was happening when the ticket was issued and people passing by just couldn't believe it was happening. Unhappy: Billy Henshaw, 17, is pictured holding the parking tickets with fellow sixth formers and staff at Oak Field School and Sports College in Bilborough, Nottinghamshire, who raised £370 for charity at the concert . ‘I know people have a job to do and it . is a no-loading zone but these are not boxes being loaded into a van, . these are children getting on a bus - and if you were that person I . think you would use a bit of judgement.’ Labour-run Nottingham City Council apologised to the school and has since revoked both fines.

A little boy has enjoyed his first game of football with his brothers after surgeons reshaped his skull and put it back together - like a jigsaw. Archie Dodd, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, was suffering from a rare condition that meant his skull fused together. Surgeons had to cut his skull into pieces then put it back together again like a jigsaw to prevent it compressing his brain and growing even more out of shape. Archie Dodd (left) is now fit as a fiddle after his major operation to reshape his skull. He had to wear a helmet for six months after the surgery (right) For six months after surgery Archie had to wear a special protective helmet and his home had to be rigged to avoid him running into tables and sharp corners. But now the cheeky-faced three-year-old is well enough to play football for the first time with brothers Callum, 12 and Spencer, eight. Parents Cheryl and Paul Dodd were told that if he didn’t have the op there would have been a risk of brain damage in the future, as the skull could begin to crush the brain. Cheryl, 38, said: 'My world crashed around me when we got the diagnosis and I felt sick when I thought about the surgery. 'We . knew there was something wrong since he was born, but we were told it . was something he would grow out of and nothing to worry about.

'I collapsed into Paul when he went into surgery, but I knew deep down it was the right thing to do. 'The scar looked horrific and when I saw him straight after I just burst into tears because of what he had been through.

The northern hemisphere's largest zip wire opened in Penrhyn Quarry, Bethesda, Bangor, North Wales today . Visitors will fly through the air at nearly 100mph for over a mile from 700ft in the air . Robert Davies became the first rider to try the zip wire at Penryhn Quarry, Bethesda, today . Robert Davies, 68, who lives near the attraction at the former slate quarry, described whizzing down the mile-long wire as 'one of the most amazing things I've ever done. 'I was just doing some part-time work in the office on the site and all of a sudden they said I would be going down the wire so I didn't have time to think about it,' said the former construction worker. 'I was a bit apprehensive when I got up there but not scared. It really is an amazing view and when you are flying through the air at 95mph it is a fantastic feeling. 'You could hear me screaming the whole way down.'

The Big Zipper also has a smaller version called The Little Zipper for those who want to take it a little easier. A rider zips over the lake of the disused quarry, which was 1,200ft deep . Seb Thompson, marketing manager for Zipwire Snowdonia, said: 'It's a really exhilarating experience that you don't get anywhere else. 'We're hoping it's going to be really popular and put North Wales on the map as the UK's number one adventure location.' Zip World in Snowdonia overtakes the Laggan Outdoor Activity Centre in Dumfries and Galloway as the United Kingdom's longest zip line. Riders at the Scottish site can pair up on its double line or do a half a mile long ride. Plans for a mile-long temporary zip-line in the Lake District were rejected by the Lake District National Park Authority in January. At the Eden Project in Cornwall, visitors can ride a 0.45mile (740metre line) across the site. In Kronplatz, Italy, a zip wire is nearly two miles long but made up of smaller lines, unlike the one in Snowdonia. But none of these match up to the world's longest zip wire is in Sun City, South Africa. Riders speed along a 2,000metre line as high as 918ft above the ground.","The Big Zipper opens at Zip World at the disused Penryhn Quarry, Bethesda .

After claiming that she would never have another surgical treatment again, cosmetic surgery addict Alicia Dovall was spotted last week with a . bandaged and bloody face. The swelling and stitches were a result of of a traumatic operation to have all her facial . implants removed, a corrective procedure that she hopes will save her looks and return her ability to smile. The painful procedure involved . breaking her jaw and nose and having her ears cut off, but the ex-model has revealed in an interview with The Sun that she . is determined to do whatever it takes to enable her to smile at baby . daughter Papaya, as she urges other women to avoid cosmetic surgery. Alicia Douvall is urging women to avoid plastic surgery as she reveals that her addition left her face so botched she couldn't even smile at her newborn baby . The heartbroken 34-year-old has revealed that her face had been so botched from surgery that she couldn't smile at her newborn when she gave birth in 2011. Alicia, who has undergone over 350 procedures and spent £1.2million on surgery since the age of 17, has two daughters, Georgia, 17, and 16-month-old Papaya. She told The Sun: ' Imagine holding . your baby daughter for the for the first time and not being able to . smile. I have been so selfish. Now my dream is for Papaya one day to see her mummy smile back at her for the first time.' Alicia also admitted her guilt at . forcing older daughter Georgia to miss an important GCSE exam so that she . could babysit while Alicia underwent yet another procedure. Last week the ex-model was seen with a swollen, bloodied face which was the result of a corrective operation to remove all of her facial implants . As . well as losing her once lovely looks and not being able to move her . face naturally, Alicia is unable to drink normally, and is often in pain. She . first went under the knife when she was 17, and since then has had six . nose jobs, 11 procedures on the skin around her eyes, cheek implants . (both adding and removal) and a facelift. Alicia says she also had a rib shortened to give her a slimmer silhouette, her toes . shortened ‘so they looked better in heels’, a tummy tuck, bottom . implants, chin implants and 16 breast augmentations.

The glamour girl started having plastic surgery aged 17 and has spent over £1million on her addiction . Comparing herself to Katie Piper, the formal model who was disfigured in an acid . attack, glamour girl Alicia says that her life has been ruined by 'attackers in white . coats'. Alicia says that . she was blinded by the predatory surgeons who promised she would look . 'perfect' but instead turned her in to a walking sideshow. She said: ‘I often used that word. I took a Barbie doll to one medical consultation to show . them exactly what I was after. 'I . was unwell; addicted to surgery. But none of those doctors tried to . stop me. I think they just wanted my money.' Alicia, seen in 2001 (left) and photographed at home in London in March 2013 (right), has undergone over 350 operations including one to have her toes shortened . She needs to have one more corrective operation to stop her face drooping, but she is urging other women never to have plastic surgery just to make themselves look better . Her addiction saw her sometimes have an operation a week, and all available funds went on her quest for perfection. She added: 'Apart . from my daughter’s education, I spent nothing on anything but surgery. I . ate beans on toast and never had a holiday. I even persuaded boyfriends . to pay for operations. ‘I’ve . had so much surgery, my face doesn’t move. I can’t smile properly and . can’t breathe through my nose.

The estranged wife of Marco Pierre White has been banned from going anywhere near the celebrity chef's home after she used her own blood to daub offensive graffiti on the side of the property and smashed up his Range Rover with a child's scooter. Matilde Conejero was also given 40 hours community service after she admitted the damage, which also included writing insults in red paint. The 47-year-old used a child’s scooter to smash the front and rear windscreens of the TV star’s top of the range 4X4 vehicle, causing £12,000 damage. Estranged: Marco Pierre White, left, and his ex-wife Matilde Conejero, right, outside Isleworth Crown Court . When he failed to answer the buzzer at this home, the mum-of-three used her own blood and red nail varnish to scrawl insults on the walls of the communal hallway outside his front door. Eventually, when another woman appeared at the door, Conejero 'lurched' at her in a jealous rage and had to be restrained by police. Nicholas Alexander, prosecuting, told Isleworth Crown Court how Pierre White, 50, was asleep at his luxury home in leafy Holland Park home on May 7 this year when he was woken by a commotion outside. Mr Alexander said: 'He had been sleeping at the time and was awoken to be told his ex-wife was outside the property. Matilde Conejero was also given 40 hours community service after she admitted the damage . 'He could hear noise coming from outside the property and went to the window to see what it was. 'Whilst looking through the window he could see his wife by his Range Rover, smashing the vehicle and damaging it using a child’s scooter. Extensive damage was caused to the vehicle.' The court heard police were called . and an officer arrived to find both windscreens had been damaged and the . panels scratched, causing thousands of pounds of damage. Mr . Alexander continued: 'As he approached the address he noticed the . defendant had a bleeding little finger and he noticed she was wearing . red nail varnish. 'As he . approached the property he saw, daubed in blood and red nail varnish, . she had written graffiti offensive towards Mr Pierre White. 'He also noticed scratches to the Oak front door and nail varnish within the lock.' The court was told that when the . officer knocked on the front door, it was opened by another woman and . Conejero 'lurched' towards her. Conejero, . who the court heard has a previous conviction for drink driving was . arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and escorted from the premises . towards an awaiting police van. In . police interviews, Conejero admitted causing the damage to the car and . home, but said she had a right to as it was jointly hers. She . pleaded not guilty in the Magistrate’s Court, but changed her plea to . guilty when the Crown Prosecution Service refused to drop the charges. Happier times: Pierre White with his third wife Mati on their wedding day, left, and, right, before their separation . But she was sentenced to the community service and also given a restraining order not to enter Addison Road in Holland Park, where the attack happened. Pierre White, who was due to give . evidence at the trial, was kept on the opposite side of the building . from his wife, but through the prosecutor he said he wanted his wife’s . behaviour to be 'observed' by the court. Mr Alexander said: 'His personal observation would be that there needs to be some recompense to the community for these actions. 'Given . that the ultimate person who would pay any costs and compensation would . be Mr Pierre White I don’t make any specific application for costs or . compensation.' David Jubb, in mitigation, described . Conejero - known as Mati - as a woman of 'impeccable character' who had . suffered since the breakdown of her marriage to the Hell’s Kitchen chef. Mr Jubb said: 'She was in a long-term relationship with the complainant. 'They . had been together since 1992 and married in 2000. They have been . separated for some time and it has been an emotional and distressing . period of time for this woman.' They have been separated for some time and it has been an emotional and distressing period of time for this woman . David Jubb, in mitigation . Judge Philip Matthews adjourned sentencing until later this month, but indicated she did not face custody. The Hell’s Kitchen star met third wife Conejero at his restaurant The Canteen where she worked as a bartender, and married in 2000. In 2003, Marco Pierre White had to spend 14 hours in a cell at Notting Hill police station after a violent row with his wife where she accused him of cheating with American banker Robin Saunders. White has denied that he was violent towards his wife, but said he had to restrain her after she threw a lamp in his face and kicked him in the groin. Ms Conejero withdrew her accusation, but not before sending out a text to White's entire phonebook saying 'Marco Pierre White has left his wife and three children for Robin Saunders' The pair have three children, Luciano, Marco Jr and Mirabelle. They began divorce proceedings in 2007, after Mati stormed into Marco's restaurant Luciano’s and accused one of the waitresses of sleeping with him in front of a restaurant full of diners. They halted proceedings them last year after running up massive legal bills totalling an estimated £3 million. She now lives in a flat above a pizza restaurant he once owned in Chiswick, west London, with their 10-year-old daughter. Pierre White, the youngest chef to be given three Michelin stars and who is estimated to be worth £25million, lives with the other two children.","Matilde Conejero used a child's scooter to smash up star's Range Rover and daubed offensive graffiti on his home .

"By . Becky Evans . PUBLISHED: . 09:13 EST, 22 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:59 EST, 22 May 2013 . The Court of Appeal judges expressed 'great sympathy' for Lindsay Sandiford (pictured in Bali) but upheld a Government decision not pay for her lawyer . Three leading judges expressed 'great sympathy' today for a British grandmother facing the death penalty in Indonesia but said a Government decision not pay for her lawyer was lawful. The UK Government refused to pay for an 'adequate lawyer' for Lindsay Sandiford, 56, who was sentenced to death by firing squad by a court in Bali for taking £1.6million of cocaine onto the island. Her appeal against the decision was rejected by Master of the Rolls Lord Dyson, Lord Justice Elias and Lord Justice Patten at the Court of Appeal. The judges said the Government's policy of not providing funding for legal representation to any British national who faces criminal proceedings abroad - even in death penalty cases - was not unlawful. Last month, Sandiford's lawyers attempted to challenge an earlier High Court ruling that the Government was not legally obliged to pay for 'an adequate lawyer' to represent her. But on April 22 the three judges dismissed the appeal by Sandiford, from Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, saying they would give their reasons at a later date. Announcing those reasons today in a written judgment, Lord Dyson said: 'One is bound to have great sympathy for the appellant. 'She is seeking to challenge a decision which, if not overturned by the Supreme Court of Indonesia, will mean that she will be executed, unless she is pardoned. 'The death penalty is, in my view, rightly regarded by the Government as immoral and unacceptable.' Sandiford, pictured in her cell, was sentenced to death by firing squad after cocaine was found in her suitcase . He said Sandiford had argued that the . policy of the Foreign Secretary of not providing funding for legal . representation in criminal proceedings abroad, even in death penalty . cases, was 'unlawful'. But he said the High Court was 'right to conclude that it is not'. Lord Dyson described Sandiford as 'a vulnerable person suffering from physical and mental health problems'. He said the Indonesian prosecutor had requested a sentence of 15 years imprisonment but judges at the District Court of Denpasar sentenced her to death on January 22. She appealed against conviction and sentence, but on April 10 the High Court of Denpasar dismissed the appeal. Sandiford was arrested at Bali's airport . last May after 10.6lb of cocaine was found in the lining of her suitcase . during a routine customs check. At last month's hearing in London, Lord . Dyson and the two other judges heard that Sandiford needed about £8,000 . to take her fight on to the Supreme Court of Indonesia. Lord Dyson said today that by the time . the challenge from the High Court's decision was heard by the Court of . Appeal 'some part of the sum required had been donated to the . appellant'. The Court of Appeal said Government's policy is based on 'coherent' reasoning and was not 'unlawful' Master of the Rolls, Lord Dyson said Sandiford is vulnerable and has 'physical and mental health problems' He added: 'It seems that, since the date of the hearing, she has received by third party donations the whole of the sum required. 'It may, therefore, be that the appellant no longer has an interest in the outcome of the appeal. 'But the appeal raises points which have implications for other UK nationals facing the death penalty abroad.' Sandiford is believed to have accrued more than £10,000 from public donations through a fundraising web page. Lord . Dyson said it was the 'longstanding policy of the UK to oppose the . death penalty in all circumstances as a matter of principle'. He . said: 'As the Secretary of State concedes, it would be possible to . produce a policy under which funds for legal representation were made . available to British nationals in certain defined circumstances. 'The practical problems identified by the Secretary of State are not insurmountable. 'But the question is not whether the Secretary of State could produce a different policy which many would regard as fairer and more reasonable and humane than the present policy. 'It is whether the policy that he has produced is irrational. 'I am in no doubt that the policy is not irrational. It is based on reasoning which is coherent and which is neither arbitrary nor perverse.'","Lindsay Sandiford was sentenced to death by firing squad at a court in Bali .

They added:'Some of the family knew they had been through a rocky period, but we thought that was past. They have kept it quiet.' Her husband, his wife: Fausto Gallardo has reportedly split from his wife for a second time while Alexandra Hollywood has been seen without her wedding ring . Unlike Paul, who released a statement on Friday, although did not comment on . reports that it was the chef's 'close friendship' with Marcela was partly to blame . for his marriage breakdown.

Accident: Factory worker Niall Page, 17, was crushed to death by a forklift truck just two days before his 18th birthday . A teenage apprentice was killed in a warehouse accident just two days before his 18th birthday, an inquest heard today. Niall Page, 17, died of a cardiac arrest caused by internal bleeding after he was crushed against a wall by a forklift in February 2011. The inquest also heard how, on earlier occasions, the youngster, from Irlam in Salford, Greater Manchester, would be raised up while stood on wooden pallets - only for driver James Renton to use the truck's gears to shake the teenager around. He was seen by and filmed by another colleague shouting 'stop, stop, stop' as he tried to keep his balance while 25-year old Renton was laughing in the driver's seat. Tragedy struck when Niall - who had been in the job for just five months - was crushed at floor level after jumping into a bay. The teenager was rushed to hospital where his mother Janet Page works a nurse - but died several hours later. As the family sat at the hospital, Renton turned up with his head bowed and confessed: 'We have all picked up bad habits. I didn't see him - I just hit him,' the inquest heard. The accident occurred after workers at Pioneer International Logistics in Trafford Park, Manchester were encouraged by senior staff to 'cut corners' by jumping on the pallets and being raised up to scan in items stored on shelves, the hearing was told. Keen rugby player Niall, who played guitar in a band and had attended music college, had also been supposed to work 9-5pm hours yet was told to work until 6pm, it was said. Mrs Page, 45, from Irlam told the hearing at Sale: 'I was concerned about Niall working there in the first place and I didn't think he had the support in the first place that he should have done. Niall was a keen musician and rugby player. He had only been in the job for five months . Another colleague had filmed Niall being 'shaken' as he stood on the fork of a fork lift truck as he scanned boxes . 'He was to be an apprentice and have a mentor. He was doing five days and meant to be doing 9-5pm but when he left at 5pm they said he had to work 9-6pm. I felt like he was being exploited. 'When I said leave the job he declined. He said he wanted to work.' The inquest was told in the moments before the tragedy Niall was stood in the pallet as it was being raised by the fork of Renton's truck. He was crushed between part of the forklift truck and an interior wall of the building. His mother had just left work at Salford Royal Hospital when she got a call saying her son had been rushed in following the accident. Mrs Page added: 'He was conscious and agitated but sat up because he was in pain. I just hugged him first. By this time the police had said that he had walked out in front of the truck and I said, ""did you?"" He said, ""no mum I didn't, I didn't"".' Family: (left to right) Sister Kelly, father Ian and mother Janet . 'I said ""did Mr Renton see you?"" He said, ""yes he did"", then he drew his knees up because he was in pain. I didn't pursue it any longer, I was just hugging him.' 'Mr Renton came and I remember my husband saying to Niall, ""your friend has come to see you"". 'He said he didn't see him step out of an empty racking, he said ""I didn't see him"" and that he ""just hit him"". Niall was coherent even though he was in pain.' The inquest heard that management at the warehouse encouraged workers to use the forklifts to raise staff to scan boxes as a time-saving measure . 'I was curious, I thought if he had been hit further down below he would have injuries down below. But he had a mark on his face, a pipe mark going down the middle of his face, a cut down his nose and bruising to his abdomen. 'He had no skin on the tips of his fingers.' 'Mr Renton just said they had all picked up bad habits and it was hard to change. All he said was that he stepped out. I knew something wasn't right and my son wasn't a liar either. 'He just sat with his head down. He seemed as though he was sad but he said he had got to go and finish his shift as they wouldn't let him home. We thought it was awful.' Stephen Holland, a trained forklift truck driver who formerly worked for Pioneer Logistics Ltd, said under safety rules workers at the factory should have scanned in storage items at ground level and not be raised up on pallets. But he said staff including Niall and another apprentice were instructed to get onto the forks of the forklift trucks and be ferried along the side of the storage racks to scan boxes as a way of 'cutting corners' in order to do the job quicker. Mr Holland said: 'I just kept quiet because I didn't want to lose my job. The general rule of forklift trucks was that you are responsible for yourself and your colleagues around you. 'The lifting of another person was not allowed but it was your responsibility for the safety of that person. 'I was always driving the trucks but I never let anyone else up. I got told in my training that if you injure the person, you are the one who will get done and could go to jail. It is your duty to look after your environment. Pioneer International Logistics Plc, located in Trafford Park in Greater Manchester, where Niall worked and died . Niall (pictured) died of a cardiac arrest. Two of his colleagues lost their jobs after the warehouse accident . 'Some people were raised all the way to the top and I had seen Niall go to the top. The supervisors knew this was going on. They would say ""jump on a truck, get James, get a pallet and raise up"". 'Niall was on the pallets, James was raising him up sometimes he would shake the truck, messing around and shaking the gears as he went to the top - shaking him down and shaking him. Stephen Holland, a former employee of Pioneer Logistics, gave evidence at the inquest . 'Niall was saying ""stop stop stop"" but James was laughing. I don't think Niall was scared, he was holding on tight to the metal bar on the front guards. 'I saw him do it quite a few times and filmed him once.' Mr Holland said on the day of the accident he had been working another shift and added: 'James rang me and said that he had killed Niall. 'He said Niall was in the truck, they were driving down one of the aisles and he was looking for a pallet. 'He lifted Niall up to the first one he scanned the pallet got him down to the bottom and scanned it in to the bay. 'He said Niall jumped out of the truck, James had gone forward. He said Niall jumped off the pallet and into the bay and he hit him in the chest. 'James panicked and has gone forward and hit him twice. He put him on the floor and ran to get some help.' Niall's fellow apprentice Luke Tabner, now 19, said: 'To save time, people would be lifted onto the fork. It was me and Niall who did it, that's just because we were apprentices. 'We would get asked to do the checks, we didn't really think, we would just do it. 'The way I felt was that they turned a blind eye to it. It didn't seem a big deal until something bad happened. I saw James Renton stood at the gate looking dead pale, he said ""I have just hurt Niall"".'

A diplomatic row has erupted between Germany and Hungary after Angela Merkel said she wouldn’t be ‘sending in the cavalry’ to sort out the fellow EU country’s problems. Hungary’s prime minister responded by referring to the Nazi invasion of his country in 1944, saying: ‘The Germans already sent the cavalry once, and in the form of tanks. Viktor Orban told listeners to his weekly radio broadcast: ‘Our request would be that they did not send them again. It wasn’t a good idea back then and it didn’t work.’ Hungarian prime minister Viktor Oban provoked anger in Berlin after comparing Angela Merkel's polices to methods used by the Nazis during the Second World War . Germany is one of several EU nations . which are increasingly concerned about Hungary’s oppression of the free . press and its continual tinkering with its constitution. Mr Orban’s Fidesz party has used its . two-thirds majority to push through controversial laws which critics say . weaken the democratic system of checks and balances on the government’s . power. Last week Mrs Merkel vowed to ‘do . everything to put Hungary onto the right path. But we won’t be sending . in the cavalry straight away’. In Germany her choice of words was . seen as a domestic reference to Peer Steinbrueck, the leader of the . opposition party, who is running against Merkel in September’s general . election. He had upset Switzerland in 2009 when . he called for governments to use ‘the whip’ against Switzerland’s ‘tax . havens’, adding that the Alpine nation faced the threat of the . ‘cavalry’. Merkel's comments referred to those made by Peer Steinbrueck, who upset Switzerland when he said the 'cavalry' should be sent in . Orban responded to Merkel's cavalry . remarks a day later by referring to German tanks which invaded Hungary . during the war in 1944. 'The Germans have already sent . cavalry to Hungary - they came in form of tanks. Our request is that . they don't send any. It didn't work out,' Orban told state broadcaster . Kossuth Radio. This comment and a report on Spiegel . Online headlined 'Orban accuses Merkel of using Nazi methods' irritated the German government. Today, German Foreign . Minister Guido Westerwelle accused Orban of 'a deplorable . derailment which we clearly reject.' Human Rights Watch . urged the European Union last week to ensure that Hungary changes its constitution. It wants laws to be brought them in line with international norms on issues . ranging from independence of the judicial system to the rights of the . homeless. Orban's Fidesz party has used its . two-thirds majority in the legislature to push through laws, including a . new constitution, which critics say weaken the democratic system of . checks and balances on the government's power. Yesterday Germany’s foreign minister accused Mr Orban of ‘a deplorable derailment which we clearly reject’. The president of the European Parliament, Germany’s Martin Schulz, also expressed irritation. He said: ‘The content of his statement is so ridiculous that one doesn’t even have to comment on it.’ And the Hungarian opposition condemned Mr Orban’s comment as a ‘coarse joke’.","Angela Merkel said they will not send in the 'cavalry' to Hungary over concerns about changes to its constitution .

Sir Alex Ferguson has agreed a £100,000-a-day deal to make 20 appearances a year as a Manchester United ambassador. The football manager, 71, is also receiving a £2million advance for his second autobiography which will be published in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Sir Alex is cashing in after retiring as Manchester United manager following the club's final game of the season last Sunday. He announced he was standing down earlier this month after winning Manchester United's record-breaking 20th league title. In 26 years with the Old Trafford club he won 38 trophies - including 13 Premier League titles and two Champions League trophies. Ferguson's lucrative deal to represent Manchester United as an ambassador was thrashed out by his son Jason. Analysts believe he could also demand £100,000 a time delivering speeches on the business management speaking circuit around the . world. Nine years ago the club pledged never to do business again with Jason Ferguson's agency. Jason’s disbanded Elite Sport ceased to act on United transfers following an internal inquiry into 99 questions posed by United’s then major shareholders, John Magnier and JP McManus, which put Sir Alex’s transfer dealings under unprecedented scrutiny. But the wheel has turned to the extent that Ferguson's reported £2million-a-year United ambassador deal was negotiated by Jason. The manager has been inundated with offers of work after announcing that he was standing down from his position. Three years ago he agreed a deal to write a second autobiography, to be published in October, for which he will be paid a £2million advance.

Although he has stood down as manager, Ferguson will remain at Old Trafford as a director of the club. Sir Alex's successor will be Everton manager David Moyes who takes who officially on July 1. Deal: Jason Ferguson thrashed out the contract which will see Sir Alex paid £2million for 20 days' work as an ambassador. The football manager retired so he could spend more time with his wife Cathy, far right . However, the Scotsman has already held talks with the club's backroom staff as he begins work on an unofficial basis.

A DVLA employee has been fired after he was caught using Facebook in the office on his own mobile phone, it was revealed today. Managers took action after it emerged the worker accessed the social networking site while at work - even though there was no suggestion he had criticised his employers on the site. The agency has previously laid off three members of staff for making 'inappropriate comments' about the DVLA, a colleague or customers. Sacked: The DVLA worker at the company's headquarters in Swansea was caught using Facebook on a mobile phone . It is thought to be the first time the government agency has taken action against an employee who used Facebook when there was no suggestion their behaviour could discredit the agency. Critics today hit out at the DVLA's 'draconian' approach to social media following the disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The latest figures were revealed after it emerged seven office workers at the the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in Swansea were suspended for 'inappropriate' comments or jokes made on Facebook earlier this year. The DVLA, which holds the records for Britain's 44 million drivers, bans all staff from accessing social networking websites on the computers they use during their shifts. Steven George-Hilley, director of technology at the think-tank Parliament Street, which obtained the figures, said: 'Sacking staff for using Facebook at work demonstrates a draconian approach to social media. Agency: The DVLA, who hold details for 44 million drivers, took action against the employee even though there was no suggestion he had discredited the agency . 'Instead, employers should be embracing digital channels and encouraging staff to use social networking sites to deliver faster, more interactive services to customers.' The employee fired last year was said to have used Facebook on a personal phone in the agency's contact centre. The DVLA said this formed part of 'a list of conduct issues' and was not the only reason for dismissal. A second employee was issued with a written warning for making an 'inappropriate' comment referencing the DVLA on Twitter. A spokesman said: 'DVLA staff cannot access any social networking sites on DVLA computers. 'Although instances of staff using social media inappropriately are extremely rare, any incidents of staff using social media at work on their personal phones are always investigated and could result in disciplinary action. 'All staff are aware of the current guidance in place and are reminded of the rules on a regular basis.'","Worker sacked even though there was no evidence he criticised his bosses .

A grandmother is being forced to become a 'health refugee' and move to England to get the cancer treatment she needs to extend her life. Maureen Fleming, 63, was diagnosed with bowel cancer six years ago and was refused the drug cetuximab in Scotland. She and her husband Ian are now considering relocating to Newcastle where . consultants say she may get the life-prolonging treatment on the NHS. Cancer sufferer Maureen Fleming and her husband Ian are seriously considering moving from Scotland to England to get the life-extending cancer drugs she needs . Their plight was raised directly with Alex Salmond during First Minister's Questions at Holyrood. The couple watched from the public gallery as Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont described them as 'health refugees'. They agreed to come to Parliament once all avenues were exhausted. While cetuximab is free in England, cancer patients in Scotland have to pay about £3,000 a month for it. Cetuximab was approved for use on the NHS by the Scottish Medicines . Consortium but the 'decision to restrict its use' was made as a result . of an application by the drugs company, said Mr Salmond. Mrs Fleming, a retired secretary from Bonhill, West Dunbartonshire, . later said: 'If you can afford to pay for the treatment, you get it. If . you can't, you don't. An option for us is to relocate down south or to . another area where we can get this drug. 'I would just like to know why you can't get it on the NHS when others get it.' Paying for the treatment privately costs about £10,000, she said. When the money runs out, the couple feel it is 'probable' they will have to move. They are already searching for suitable rented accommodation. Mr Fleming, a 65-year-old retired shipyard supervisor, said: 'We feel as . if the NHS is letting us down. I've worked all my life, I've worked . right up to when I retired last year. Mrs Fleming was diagnosed with bowel cancer six years ago, and was refused the drug cetuximab in Scotland . 'We've three children with families of their own. They've all got that . work ethic that's been instilled in them from their mum and I. Maureen . only stopped working to have kids, then back to work again. 'So we feel as if we've contributed our NHS for 50 years and we can't . get the drug that Maureen needs. We think it's very unfair that as . citizens of here we have to move to England. ""We've got families and it would involve a bit of upheaval because we . do, like most grandparents, nursery runs, picking up the kids, school . runs, so our children can go to work. There's that aspect too, that we'd . be giving up that to move to England.' The couple, who have 10 grandchildren, approached Labour MSP Jackie Baillie more than six months ago to raise their concerns. Mrs Fleming was described by her consultant as an 'ideal candidate' for the treatment. The couple's plight was raised directly with Alex Salmond during First Minister's Questions at Holyrood.  The couple watched from the public gallery as Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont (left) described them as 'health refugees' 'To pretend to people that there is a solution to these hugely difficult . questions that are being faced by every health service across the . world, in terms of efficacy of what drugs can be approved for use, is . misleading people entirely,' Mr Salmond said. Asked what Ms Fleming thought of the First Minister's responses, she said: 'Not a lot.' She continued: 'The drug is there, the treatment is there for anybody . that needs it. You're not getting it because you're not in this wee box. If you can pay for it, it's there for you. It seems unfair.' In the debating chamber, Labour leader Ms Lamont said prescriptions for . aspirin and paracetemol can be free while cancer treatment can be . denied. 'Scots with hayfever can get their prescription for free but Scots with . cancer may have to leave their homeland for treatment to save their . lives. Cancer sufferer Maureen Fleming and her husband Ian are seriously considering moving from Scotland to England to get the life-saving cancer drugs she needs . 'The . Flemings are a proud family.

'Time . is short, so Maureen Fleming has come to this chamber today to hear . first-hand what is the First Minister's advice to her and cancer victims . like her.' A spokesman for the First Minister later criticised her assertion, . arguing that painkillers are frequently prescribed to long-term . sufferers of conditions such as heart disease or chronic pain. Ms Baillie, the Flemings' local MSP, said her party would 'absolutely' find the cash to offer more cancer drugs to patients.","Maureen Fleming, 63, was diagnosed with bowel cancer six years ago .

Just 17 per cent of people were found to change their bedding every week, while 28 per cent admit they only wash their sheets once a month. Even more concerning was the discovery that 24 per cent of Britons have not changed their sheets for more than six months. The survey also revealed that 32 per cent of people have not cleaned their bathroom properly for at least six months. Just 17 per cent of people change their bedding every week, while 28 per cent admit they only wash their sheets once a month . Only 29 per cent say they vacuum or sweep their house every week. The research also revealed that women are even worse at housekeeping than men are – 19 per cent of men claim to change their bedding every week, compared to only 15 per cent of women. However, women were found to be better about cleaning the bathroom – 41 per cent of women claim to clean their bathroom every week, compared to just 36 per cent of men. While the research, conducted by sales website HushHush.com,  suggested that Britons are not very good at cleaning their own homes, it did reveal that we want to live in clean houses – 62 per cent said that they would employ a cleaner if they could afford to. Dr Adam Fox, a paediatric allergist at a leading London teaching hospital, warned that dirty sheets could exacerbate a number of health problems. He told MailOnline:  'Having good bedroom hygiene when it comes to changing your sheets is about more far than just freshening up your linen. 'We spend about a third of our lives asleep and this is reflected in the debris that we leave between the sheets. 'Our bodies shed millions of skin cells each day, many of which rub off in our sleep and are deposited in our beds. The survey, which would horrify How Clean is Your House? stars Kim Woodburn and Aggie MacKenzie, also revealed that 32 per cent of people have not cleaned their bathroom for six months . 'In addition to skin cells, our bodies also secrete fluids, sweat and oils during a long night’s sleep. 'While unsavoury in themselves, these deposits mostly pose a problem as they are all deliciously appealing for dust mites.' He added that while dust mites in themselves are quite harmless, the droppings of the microscopic creatures are laden with allergens which can cause health complications. When inhaled, these allergens can provoke asthma and rhinitis and may also worsen eczema. 'In order to reduce the possible problems caused by dust mites, the professional recommendation is that people with dust mite allergies should be taking a number of measures to reduce allergen exposure. 'Those who suffer particularly badly should consider investing in dust mite proof bedding and we should all be making it a priority to wash our sheets once or twice a week at 60 degrees. 'It may seem like a bit of a chore but taking these precautions helps to protect against the health complications which may be caused or worsened by the unwanted dust mites which share our sheets.'","17 per cent change their bedding every week, 28 per cent once a month .

Battler: Brave Jessica Vardy, with her mother Dawn, was given 10 months to live, but now she is on the road to recovery from a rare cancer . A little girl with a terminal tumour who was told she had just ten months to live is on the road to an amazing recovery after battling the rare cancer. Jessica Vardy, five, was diagnosed with a Rhabdoid tumour under her left armpit which had spread through her arm on Christmas Eve. Her parents had thought the mystery pain in her arm was a trapped nerve. But five months later, doctors finally revealed Jessie had a cancerous tumour - and predicted she had just 10 months to live. Only two children in the UK are diagnosed each year with the rare cancer, which usually spreads from the kidney or brain - prompting Jessie's grave prognosis. But the brave little girl has continued to battle the cancer and after months of chemotherapy, she is defying the odds and going from strength to strength. It has not spread to or from anywhere else in her body and the tumour has already reduced by 70 per cent. And doctors will operate to remove as much of the tumour as possible next month - before ongoing chemotherapy is hoped to destroy it altogether. Recovering: Jessica is described by her mother Dawn as 'our little miracle after fighting back against the cancer . Jessica's mum Dawn, 35, from Bishops Waltham, Hants, said: 'The pain of hearing the news that our daughter had a rare form of cancer, with little hope of survival, broke us to the core. Treatment: Jessica in hospital where she has had months of chemotherapy that have reduced the tumour by 70 per cent . 'You love your children more than anything and it was awful to know that someone you love so much could be taken away. 'But our little girl has defied the odds and we are astounded that despite her consultants' fears, her tumour is actually shrinking. 'To be even talking about surgery and physiotherapy is amazing - especially considering we were told she wouldn't survive the year. 'It made us value our family and our time that we have together, we appreciate it more and we don't take it for granted. 'It has been a reminder of those things that are important.' When Jessica left a summer fete with a mystery pain in her arm on the eve of her fifth birthday in July, Dawn thought she'd simply hurt it playing. But as her agonising pain worsened over the following months, her loving family - who thought she had trapped a muscle - were left baffled. They repeatedly returned to their GP as the pain killers did little to ease their little girl's suffering. But it was not until Christmas Eve that Jessica was finally diagnosed with a tumour. Dawn, who also has a eight-year-old son Josh, added: 'It got to the point where we were having her sleep in our bed as she was just in so much pain. 'I was told by doctors to give her pain relief medicine and to make sure she rested it. But when it got to Christmas Eve and she was still in agony, I just thought, 'I can't let her spend Christmas like this'. 'It was then a doctor noticed something wasn't right and told us it wasn't muscular and that we should take her to hospital straight away. Devoted: Dawn and Jessica. 'You love your children more than anything and it was awful to know that someone you love so much could be taken away, 'she says . 'They did an ultra sound and an MRI scan and that was when our whole world was turned upside down.' Jessica was immediately put on a course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy at Southampton General Hospital in Hampshire. Doctors have been amazed at how well she has responded to treatment. Her case is now being monitored by oncologists across Europe. Dawn added: 'Jessie is a walking miracle and she has been so brave too. She coped so well with the injections, the needles, the chemotherapy and even losing her hair. 'It's been so hard on us all but we are getting there - and that's mostly thanks to the inspirational strength our little miracle Jessie has shown.' Dawn's family and her friends are fundraising and have already raised £4,000 for the Piam Brown Ward in Southampton and Cancer Research UK. They will also run Race for Life in Winchester next month and the Great South Run in Portsmouth in October.

Jeremy Hunt will unveil plans for a £260million system to dispense drugs electronically and signal the end for written prescriptions . The Health Secretary will signal the end of written prescriptions today. Jeremy Hunt is to unveil plans for a £260million system that will dispense drugs electronically and, he says, prevent needless deaths. At least 11 people died in the NHS last year because they were given the wrong drugs or incorrect doses. Medicines are being prescribed incorrectly because patients’ notes are lost, while research suggests that eight per cent of hospital prescriptions have mistakes in them. Mr Hunt will announce that he is accepting a key recommendation of the Francis report into the scandal at Mid Staffordshire Hospital, in which hundreds of patients are thought to have died needlessly, for better use of technology to improve care. The fund will first be used by hospitals to replace paper-based systems for patient notes and prescriptions, a key step towards an entirely digital NHS by 2018. Eventually it will be rolled out to GPs’ surgeries, marking an end to the written prescription. It will be primarily used for ‘electronic prescribing’ in which computer-generated prescriptions, using barcodes unique to each patient, are sent by doctors directly to pharmacies. Government advisers say the technology will greatly reduce the scope for errors – such as poor handwriting – and improve safety. The new system of electronic records will protect patients, Mr Hunt will say, by also ensuring that doctors and nurses are able to access accurate details about the care of a patient wherever they are being treated. ‘This fund will allow doctors and nurses to make the NHS safer by harnessing the very latest technology,’ he will add. At least 11 people died in the NHS last year because they were given the wrong drugs or incorrect doses . ‘In many places, right now, a . paramedic picking up a frail elderly woman who has had a fall will not . always know she has dementia, because he or she cannot access her notes. 'Or a doctor is prescribing the wrong drugs, because they don’t know . what drugs their patient is already on. ‘If . we are to improve patient safety then we must allow the NHS to have . access to the best tools available and this fund will help them achieve . that.’ Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, said: ‘This new fund will help patients get better and safer care by giving clinicians access to the right information when they need it most. ‘Supporting hospitals to replace outdated paper systems for notes and prescriptions will help relieve patients’ frustration at having to repeat their medical and medication history over and over again, often in the same hospital, because their records aren’t available. ‘Expanding the use of electronic prescribing of medications in hospitals will help improve safety, save lives and save taxpayers’ money.’ Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, (left) said the new fund, announced by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (right) will give patients  'better and safer care' Tim Kelsey, national director for patients and information at NHS England, said: ‘We are delighted to be working with the NHS, Department of Health colleagues and frontline NHS staff to ensure that this fund enables the NHS to make substantial progress towards routine use of high-quality data at the point of care. ‘This step change in integrating diverse information sources around the needs to the patient will support clinicians and provider organisations deliver world class patient care.’ The Government has already announced that by 2015 everyone who wants it will be able to get online access to their GP record. They will also be able to book appointments with their own doctor and order repeat prescriptions online. Mr Hunt announced last month that patients are to be given the right to opt out of a new NHS database logging details of drinking habits, waist sizes and family medical histories. Following protests from privacy campaigners, people will be allowed to instruct their GPs not to hand over their records to a centralised information bank. Around 700,000 patients are thought to have opted out of an existing scheme allowing GPs to share information on their medical history with other parts of the NHS.","11 people given the wrong drugs or doses died in the NHS last year .

Twitter could be worth more than £7billion ($11bn) if it goes public in 2014, a financial research firm claimed today. New York specialist financial researchers Greencrest claims the social networking firm is already preparing to take the company public next year, according to a new report. The firm made its valuation after analysing trading in secondary markets, where shares are privately traded. Twitter Co-Founders (from left) Evan Williams, Jack Dorsey and Biz Stone, photographed in their offices in downtown San Francisco, California. The service was originally launched in October 2006, by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Evan Williams and Biz Stone . It has over over 500 million registered users as of 2012, generating over 340 million tweets daily and handling over 1.6 billion search queries per day. Over 200m active users send tweets each month. Max Wolff, an analyst with Greencrest, told Forbes that Twitter's value is up since Facebook went public last year. 'Using the secondary market for shares to mark enterprise value is a very difficult and opaque process. 'It is a rumor rich and special share class soup,' he told the publication. However, it is believed that Facebook and games maker Zynga's recent poor IPOs (Initial Public Offering) may have affected the valuation. Facebook's shares are down 26% since its IPO, while Zynga's value has dropped by 75%. A funding round in 2011 valued Twitter at $8bn, after which the value rose to $10bn on secondary markets before Facebook's IPO pushed the value back down to $9bn. Greencrest analyst Max Wolff said Twitter's value has also been swollen by speculation that Apple is interested in acquiring the company. Twitter is preparing to take the company public in 2014, and could already be worth as much as $11bn, according to a report by specialist financial researchers Greencrest. 'That said, Twitter is up since the Facebook IPO and is now valued at northward of $11bn. 'This makes sense as growth in users and new monetisation efforts are both yielding fruit and pointing toward a good 2013 for Twitter.' Backing up comments made late last year by chairman Jack Dorsey, currently on holiday with model Lily Cole, that 'You can think of an IPO as an exit or a goal, or you can think of it as more of a milestone. 'For us, it's a milestone,' he said. Dorsey also said the firm would IPO 'when we feel the company is ready for that milestone.' Greencrest also uses recent managerial shifts to back up their claim, pointing to Ali Rowghani’s move from CFO to COO, and the addition of ex-Zynga guy Mike Gupta as CFO. Also, Newsvine’s Mike Davidson is now on board as VP of design.","Social networking firm preparing to go public in 2014, claim financial researchers Greencrest .

The police dispatcher who spoke to kidnap victim Amanda Berry after she escaped from the Cleveland house of horrors is being investigated over claims he swore at the end of her 911 call. The man has previously been criticized for failing to keep Miss Berry on the line or comfort her during her desperate call for help. But now new allegations have been made that the dispatcher calls Miss Berry a 'f****** b****' just before hanging up. It was Miss Berry's 911 call that led to the discovery of fellow kidnap victims Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight after she bravely escaped the house on Seymour Avenue. The three women had been held captive at the house for about a decade where they were repeatedly raped and tortured. Suspect Ariel Castro, 52, remains on suicide watch in custody as he faces preliminary charges of rape and kidnapping. DNA tests showed Castro is the father of a six-year-old girl born to Miss Berry during her time in captivity. She finally broke free with the help of a neighbor and raised the alarm. The 911 dispatcher - one of the . first people Miss Berry spoke to after her decade long captivity -  has come under fire for the way he handled the conversation with the clearly distressed 26-year-old. Experts in the U.S. say a muffled sound at the end of the call is the dispatcher cursing at Miss Berry. Audio forensic experts hired by Cleveland station 19 Action News believe swear words were used. The dispatcher is now being investigated by Cleveland City Hall, according to reports. Cleveland station WOIO has reported that the results from an investigation by a police forensic audio team were inconclusive. One of the 19 Action News experts . says the 'second work is b****', while the second believes the . dispatcher said 'f****** b****'. During the two-minute conversation, Miss Berry, is heard screaming down the phone: 'I've been kidnapped and I've been missing for 10 years, and I'm, I'm here, I'm free now.' But multiple times the . dispatcher’s response was 'Talk to the police when they get there,' before asking the name of Miss . Berry’s captor, as well as his age and ethnicity. In the 911 call Miss Berry implores . the dispatcher that she needs the police immediately, but she is told . authorities will be sent as soon as a 'car becomes open.' At one point when Miss Berry says 'I'm . Amanda Berry. I've been on the news for the last 10 years,' the . dispatcher replies 'I got that, dear.' Michelle Knight (right) and Gina DeJesus (left) were rescued after Miss Berry escaped and raised the alarm . Suspect Ariel Castro, pictured this month at Cleveland Municipal Court, is accused of kidnapping Miss Berry, Miss DeJesus and Miss Knight and keeping them captive for ten years . As Miss Berry becomes more frantic the dispatcher says 'The police are on their way; talk to them when they get there.'

The River Cam is world-famous for its civilsed punting and beautiful scenery, but staff policing the river now say they feel too afraid to work there without stab vests. Officials in Cambridge have requested protection because of the growing hostility they face while on patrol. The Cam Conservators group, who tackle illegal mooring and monitor river bylaws, made the proposal at their latest meeting. Hostility: Staff patrolling the River Cam, famed for its punting, say they are now working in fear of attack . River bailiff Adrian Hoyes revealed that he feels so unsafe that he lives in fear of knife attacks. The report said: 'The river bailiff has asked to be issued with a 'stab' vest given the increase in hostility displayed towards staff.' City Councillor Kevin Price, a member of the Conservators group, said: 'It was felt that, in terms of a duty of care to staff and to protect them, it was better to be safe than sorry. 'It's a sign of a sad time when we have got to think about providing such equipment for a guy who is just doing a job.' Tensions: Despite the idyllic scenery, there has been a worrying rise in antisocial behaviour on the river . Congestion: Part of the antisocial behaviour problem has been the intense rivalry of competing punting companies . Trouble at the busy tourist attraction in recent years has included heavy congestion, sunken punts, vandalism and a tense rivalry between punt operators. Fears were also raised over the loutish behaviour of punters, such as urinating in public. The meeting heard: 'A live-aboard boater complained a rowing eight came close to their vessel and one of the crew members stood up and urinated openly in front of them at breakfast time. 'The live-aboard owner tooted the boat horn at them in objection. 'The crew found this very amusing.' River manager Dr Philippa Noon is concerned that there is growing frustration between motorised boats and Cambridge's famous rowers. She said: 'A certain minority of powered craft owners take a bloody-minded attitude towards rowers, either failing to give way to them or not reducing their speed or wash when passing.' A second report revealed a spate of boats deliberately being set free and house boats being burgled. It not only humans that have proved troublesome on the river in recent years. Last year Britain’s most vicious swan, nicknamed Mr Asbo, was removed to a secret location to protect river users after a series of attacks on rowers and boaters.","Staff on punting idyll the River Cam no longer feel safe .

Blow a dandelion and make a wish, goes the saying... and one dog-walker was certainly spoilt for choice today as the field before him contained thousands of them. Robert Wolstenholme, a nature . reserve warden for Natural England, had taken his dog Mazy for some exercise near his . home in Great Somerford, Wiltshire. To his amazement, the 52-year-old saw a sea of white seeds in the distance as he took his flat-coated retriever for a morning stroll. This was the scene in a field in Great Somerford, Wiltshire, today, as photographed by dog walker Robert Wolstenholme . Mr Wolstenhome could barely see the green grass in the field as thousands of the weed's seeds covered the ground. He said: 'I was walking my dog by the river and, when I looked across, I couldn't believe the sea of white in the field. 'It was a brilliant and breathtaking sight. You could hardly see any grass.' After walking around the huge five hectare field, Mr Wolstenholme stopped in the area that caught his eye to take photographs. He added: 'The field is huge and I . walked for a while to find the area that had the most dandelions so I . could capture the best moment. 'There were around 500 dandelions per square metre and it was covering it all - it was an amazing sight.' 'There were around 500 dandelions per square metre and it was covering it all - it was an amazing sight,' said Mr Wolstenholme . Mr Wolstenholme said that the lack of wind and rain in the area has resulted in an abundance of dandelion seeds. He continued: 'There hasn't been a lot of wind and rain in Great Somerford in recent weeks so the dandelion seeds haven't blown away like they normally would.' The dandelion seeds are normally dispersed after being carried on the wind like tiny parachutes. Dry and sunny for Bank Holiday... but first, a few showers . More wet weather is on the way but the Bank Holiday weekend looks set to be dry and sunny, forecasters say. After some heavy showers on Friday most of the country will enjoy decent weather with temperatures reaching up to 62F (17C) in the south - on par with Paris, Barcelona and Venice. Temperatures will be slightly cooler in the north and could dip to as low as 8C in some places. But Met Office forecaster Helen Chivers said this should clear away by the weekend, adding: 'It will be nice pretty much everywhere.' She added: 'We've got some cold, windy and wet weather to come over the next couple of days because of a low pressure system moving eastwards across the country. 'Thursday and Friday temperatures will not be terribly high, only reaching between 11 and 13C, and a bit colder in some places. 'But after that, Saturday and Sunday look pretty decent days for the Bank Holiday at the moment. 'It will be dry in most places with some sunshine as well. 'On Saturday, temperatures will reach 60F (16C) while we'll see temperatures of 62F (17C) on Sunday in the south. It might still feel a little cool in the shade but should feel pretty warm in the sun.' Ms Chivers said it won't top the 84F (23.8C) - the warmest day of the year so far - we had on May 7 in Drumburgh in Cumbria but will bring us back to average temperatures for this time of year. By Monday, the nice weather will tail off in some parts with spells of rain, particularly in Northern Ireland and western Scotland. And forecasters warned anyone planning a trip in the mountains should expect potentially hazardous conditions. 'Scotland will be the worst-hit place so if anyone is walking in the mountains, they should be careful to prepare themselves as there is likely to be snow and high winds. 'It will feel particularly cold,' Ms Chivers added. Dandelion seeds are carried on the wind like tiny parachutes . On a breezy day, a dandelion seed can be blown miles from its parent plant. The parachute part of the seed drops off when it strikes an obstacle, which is why so many grow in crevices next to walls.

When soprano Laura Wright steps on to the pitch in front of 81,000 rugby fans at Twickenham this afternoon, she hopes to dazzle in a stylish outfit that won’t suffer the sort of revealing wardrobe malfunction that made headlines at the Six Nations a fortnight ago. Yet away from the limelight, the 22-year-old shuns glamour for the rough and tumble of rugby first-hand – playing full-back for her local club in South-West London where spectators number in the dozens, not the tens of thousands. Now, in this exclusive Mail on Sunday photoshoot, the ‘Scrummy Soprano’ shows off both sides of her image, posing in both a mud-splattered England kit and a Maria Grachvogel designer gown. Pitch Perfect: Laura Wright in an England Strip, left, and modelling a gown by designer Maria Grachvogel . ‘It’s nice to feel girly and glamorous sometimes,’ Laura says. But she admits that  her last appearance as England’s official anthem singer – when a gust of wind lifted up her white split-to-the-armpit Jasper Conran dress and exposed her hotpants – wasn’t quite the image she was hoping to project. ‘You’re representing your country,’ she says. ‘You don’t want to overstep the mark.’ She promises to be more demure when she sings at today’s England-Italy clash. ‘I can’t wear any less,’ she admits. ‘Could you call it a dress? It was a bit of material, wasn’t it? There were wind issues last time, but I didn’t really think about it. I just wanted to go out and look good and sing well.’ High note: Laura Wright revealed a little too much of her white hotpants when she sang the national anthem ahead of the RBS Six Nations match between England and France at Twickenham last month . There is little doubt that Laura takes everything she does seriously. As well as studying at the Royal  College of Music and working on her third solo album, she is training for the London Marathon and an international CrossFit challenge, an intense discipline combining weightlifting, sprinting and gymnastics. Sport, not singing, was her first love, and she relishes her time playing for the Rosslyn Park Ladies, nicknamed the ‘Slingbacks’, even if it means that she is forever having to cover the cuts on her legs for her professional singing engagements. ‘I can’t tell you how your body feels after a rugby match,’ she says. ‘It’s like nothing else, like no other sport I’ve ever done.’ Her first match after her last Twickenham appearance was against Beckenham. ‘They were quite aggressive at the beginning,’ she recalls. ‘We didn’t win but we only lost 20-nil. It was a vast improvement, as the first time we lost 55-nil.’ Action girl: England Rugby's official national anthem soprano singer Laura Wright also plays for full-back for her team Rosslyn Park Ladies . Suffolk-born Laura has been hailed as the next Katherine Jenkins, although it is a comparison Laura dislikes. She says: ‘Katherine has done so well, but I want to make my own name. It’s so funny how different we are. When I’m not working, I’m always in jeans and trainers. I respect what she does, but I want to do things differently.’ Laura shot to prominence when she won BBC Radio 2’s Chorister  Of The Year competition at 15. She  then became the youngest member of the classical girl band All Angels, leaving after she won her college place. Nevertheless, combining demands there with her own career is difficult. Laura explains: ‘It’s been a struggle. There are five singers in my year. About 600 apply. So the college is going to expect a lot of you, that’s understandable. But I’d be silly not to take all the opportunities given to me. As a performer, you want to perform to as many people as possible.’ And she certainly won’t be short of an audience at Twickenham today.","Laura Wright preparing to sing anthem in front of 81,000 rugby fans .

A British climber has angered the Nepalese government by giving an 'illegal' interview to the BBC on his smartphone from the top of Mount Everest. It was the first time a video call has been made from the summit of the mountain, but explorer Daniel Hughes' joy was tempered by the fury of the government. Anyone making a call for 'media' purposes from the top of the world's highest mountain has to have permission from the government, which he didn't have. Daniel Hughes prepares to speak to the BBC on Mount Everest in what has been branded an illegal interview with the Nepalese government . Mr Hughes is to receive a rebuke from government officials when he returns to the capital, Kathmandu . The situation was made worse by the fact he was wearing a clown's red nose for charity. When word of the interview got out, the government said it would be speaking to Mr Hughes . when he returned to the capital, Kathmandu. 'Mr . Hughes has broken the law by not seeking permission from the . communication ministry to film, broadcast or conduct media related . events on Everest,' said Mr Purnachandra Bhattarai, joint secretary of . Nepal's tourism Ministry. Mr Hughes was joyful when he made contact with the BBC. 'This is the world's first live video call,' he said, breathing heavily through an oxygen mask. 'Never been done before.' He had become the first person to make a video call atop Everest . Putting in a plug for the Android phone he used, he said: 'I had to share this not only because the HTC One is the phone I use, but just imagine what will be available in the future. 'I don't have a cameraman with me - it's me and a pole and an HTC smart phone and an Inmarsat modem.' He pointed out that he had to use a stylus to work the phone because if he took his gloves off his fingers would fall off with the cold. The trekking agency he used was also in deep trouble. Mr Bhattarai said the agency had been placed 'under investigation', but he did not give further details. Nor has it been revealed what the government plans to do with Mr Hughes when he returns to Kathmandu. Mr Hughes was among 146 people who reached the summit on Sunday during what was called a 'fair weather' window. Records were claimed at the time by the first women from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to reach the top and Indian sisters became the first twins to make the ascent. Climbs to aid charities have become increasingly popular on Everest, but the mountain has also attracted people from around the world who simply want to make the ascent. Last year, more than 250 climbers reached the summit in a 48-hour stretch of good weather. But there have also been incidents between climbers and Sherpas, the most dramatic coming last month when a British climber and two Europeans became involved in a fist fight with their Sherpas close to the peak. Mr Hughes reached the summit with 146 other people yesterday and was keen to the world about his achievements . This climbing season marks the 60th anniversary of Edmund Hillary's and Tenzing Norgay's maiden summit. Commenting on Mr Hughes' broadcast and the earlier fight, Mr Bhattarai said: 'This summit season has already been marked by controversy and we don't want it to happen again.' Mr Hughes has been trying to raise £1 million for Comic Relief.","Daniel Hughes becomes first man to make video call from summit .

The biological mother of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has said she wants to meet him face-to-face but has denied she wants back in his life because of his new found fame. With less than two weeks to go until Kaepernick takes to the field against the Baltimore Ravens in New Orleans for the Super Bowl, Heidi Russo opened her heart up about the decision to give her son up for adoption as a scared 19-year-old, 25 years-ago. After watching Kaepernick's stellar performances in this, his breakout year, Russo said, 'Don't get me wrong, I am not 'coming out' to share in any of the success Colin is having, I just want him to know I never stopped thinking about him.' Heidi Russo gave an emotional interview in which she explained her ongoing pain at giving up her biological son Colin Kaepernick for adoption 25-years ago . Star quarterback: Colin Kaepernick has led the 49ers to the Super Bowl this year . Currently living and working in Thornton, Colorado, as a dental nurse with an eight-year-old son, Russo explained to Fox 11 the heart-breaking decision she went through to give Colin up when she was a teenager living in Milwaukee. 'It is the toughest decision that I have ever made. But, for him, it was the right decision,' said Heidi. 'For me personally, I was in a situation that wasn't planned, certainly wasn't in a position to give Colin the life that I wanted him to have.' Heidi explains that she has only ever spent six weeks with her son and is thankful to Rick and Terersa Kaepernick for taking her son out of her hands. Speaking from her home in Thornton, Colorado, Heidi Russo also became emotional when she explained how proud she was of Colin and his achievements this year . This has been Colin Kaepernick's break-out year and he has starred as the quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers on their way to the Super Bowl in New Orleans . Inked: The heavily tattooed football star is having a big season with the 49ers . 'He was born in 1987 and I took care of him for six weeks and I was fortunate enough and blessed with Rick and Teresa who adopted him.' Explaining that Colin never left her thoughts, Heidi says that updates from the Kaepernicks, including photos and letters about Colin's progress had to stop when he was seven as they were affecting her ability to move on with her own life. 'I couldn't move forward with my life - I would wait for her letters, I would wait for pictures. It was really hard.' 'His whole life I have thought about him, every birthday. You think about him, you don't just forget.' In December, Heidi spoke to the Mercury News about her exposure to the media as the parent of a 'celebrity' that she doesn't really know, describing it as 'obviously a strange experience.' 'But I've been interested in getting a chance to see Colin, to be with him, since the day he was given up for adoption,' she added. New family: Kaepernick's biological mom says she's grateful for his adopted parents. At right, Kaepernick poses with his sister Devon on her wedding day . Heidi Russo received regular correspondence from Colin's adoptive parents up until she asked them to stop when he was seven years old because the pain was too great . Heidi has made numerous attempts to get back into contact with Colin over the past 18-years and each one has been rebuffed in a polite or lukewarm manner. 'I have to respect his wishes,' explained Russo. Sportsman: Kaepernick excelled in three sports in high school, but ultimately chose football . 'If and when he changes his mind - he may never change his mind - I'll watch him from home. 'When I have a chance to get out to a game, I'll watch him from there.' During one of the brief exchanges they did have, Colin asked Heidi about his biological father. Heidi explained to the Mercury News that she tried to contact him, but got no reply. 'I never got a response,' explained Russo. 'He has denied him for 25 years, so nothing has changed.' Having given birth to another child Heidi wondered how things might have worked out had she been more prepared in 1987. 'I made my call on Colin a long time ago,' she says. 'I have to live with that. 'It's his life. The Kaepernicks have been great. They have given Colin everything he could want and more. They were able to raise him in the same kind of athletic environment that I grew up in. I wanted him to have a great life, and that's what he has.' In high school, Kaepernick excelled in football, baseball and basketball, but his passion was for the gridiron. When he was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in 2009 as a student at the University of Nevada, he declined and opted to finish school. He was drafted by 49ers two years later. Fan favorite: Kaepernick signs autographs for some of the 49ers faithful in San Francisco . From Kaepernick's point of view, he has reportedly made his feelings clear about resisting the public calls from his biological mother to reunite. 'I think he would view it as almost treasonous to them to meet with his biological mother or father,' said former University of Nevada roommate Virgil Green to Yahoo News. 'They did such a great job giving him everything he needed to be successful in life.' Rick and Teresa Kaepernick have indicated to Colin that they will support any decision he makes regarding his biological parents. After having failed to meet any adoptive parents she liked during her pregnancy, Heidi had come to terms with keeping Colin when a family friend who works for the Lutheran Social Services in Wisconsin introduced her to the Kaepernick's. Colin Kaepernick has kept contact with his biological mother to a minimum and has not met her since she gave him up for adoption . The couple had two children of their own and had lost another two to heart defects. 'I knew they were the right people immediately,' said Heidi, who was living in Milwaukee at the time. 'The first thing Teresa did when she met me was give me a hug. They were such giving, wonderful people from the moment I met them.' Under Wisconsin law there is a six-week waiting period between when a child is born and when he or she can be officially adopted. If the parent cannot cope, the child goes into foster care. 'I refused to have him in foster care, there was no way. I raised him for the first six weeks,' said Heidi. Quarterback Colin Kaepernick will rise to national prominence if the 49ers defeat the Baltimore Ravens to win Super Bowl XLVII . During those six weeks, she developed a mother-son bond that complicated giving up her child. 'I think your mind and your body do things to help you forget truly painful experiences like that,' said Heidi. 'I remember going to the courthouse to sign all the papers, then we went somewhere else for the exchange. It might have been the Lutheran Social Services building, but I really can't remember. 'All I remember is that we had to be in separate rooms. The adoption officials came and got Colin from me and then took him to the Kaepernicks. 'That's the one thing I wish I had done differently. I wish I had given him directly to the Kaepernicks.","Heidi Russo repeated her desire to meet her son Colin Kaepernick - the San Francisco 49ers quarterback .

A man suspected of supplying the gun used  in the quadruple murder in the Alps, in which three members of the British al-Hilli family died, has been arrested in Switzerland. He is the first suspect apprehended since the shootings near Lake Annecy, in eastern France, six months ago. Saad al-Hilli, 50, an engineer from Weybridge, Surrey, his wife Iqbal, 47, mother-in-law Suhaila al-Allaf, 74 were all shot twice through the . head in their BMW parked in a remote Alpine beauty spot on September 5. French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old father of three, was also shot with a Luger P08. The arrest took place in Geneva, less than an hour’s drive from Annecy. The suspect was held ‘for a number of days’ but denied all knowledge of the gun. The French and Swiss authorities have refused to identify the man. News of last month’s arrest emerged as detectives from a number of countries, including Britain and France, met in The Hague last week to discuss the case. Meanwhile, the investigation into the massacre of a British family in the French Alps is to be extended to the victims' links to their native Iraq, officials revealed today. The widening of the hunt for the killer of the Al-Hilli family comes after revelations of a possible connection to the former regime of Saddam Hussein. Two French judges now want to travel to Baghdad to probe claims the deposed tyrant may have deposited £840,000 into a Swiss bank account in the name of victim Said al-Hilli's father.

The Al-Hilli's daughter Zeinab, seven, was treated for a bullet wound and severe head injuries, while her sister Zeena, four, survived after hiding from the killer beneath her mother's body. Annecy chief prosecutor Eric Maillaud told France's Journal du Dimanche newspaper: 'Sooner or later we will have to go to Baghdad. 'The aim is to understand if we can make a link between the murders and the Iraqi origins of the victims. 'We want to know exactly what Said al-Hilli's father did professionally in Iraq, where he got his wealth from and why he left the country.

The penalty phase of the Jodi Arias murder trial wrapped up for the day on Monday after a series of legal arguments in which her defense lawyers asked for a mistrial and to withdraw from the case. The trial is scheduled to continue on Tuesday with Arias speaking to the jury. The judge denied the defense's request for a mistrial based on a key witness receiving death threats. In protest of the judge's decision, defense lawyers Kirk Nurmi and Jennifer Willmott asked to withdraw. Pressure: Jodi Arias looks at her family during the penalty phase of her murder trial at Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix on Monday. No witnesses are speaking in her defense . The judge promptly denied that request. The defense then said they have no plans to call any witnesses, sending the court into recess as lawyers worked to resolve the next step. They later decided Arias would speak to the jury on Tuesday. Arias and an ex-boyfriend had been expected to speak to jurors before the panel begins deliberating whether to sentence the 32-year-old Arias to life in prison or execution for murdering her lover in 2008. Arias was convicted of first-degree murder earlier this month in the death of Travis Alexander. Last week, jurors heard tearful comments from Alexander's brother and sister as they described how his killing has torn their lives apart. Judge Sherry Stephens instructed jurors they could consider a handful of factors when deciding what sentence to impose, including Arias' lack of a prior criminal record and assertions that she was a good friend, had an abusive childhood and is a talented artist. In opening statements, prosecutor Juan Martinez told the panel none of those factors should cause the jury to even consider a sentence other than death, given the brutal nature of the killing. Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi explained to jurors that Arias herself would testify this week. Discussions: Judge Sherry Stephens meets with prosecutor Juan Martinez, left, and defense attorneys Jennifer Wilmott and Kirk Nurmi, right, after denying a motion for mistrial . 'When you understand who Ms Arias is, you will understand that life is the appropriate sentence,' Nurmi said. Arias, 32, acknowledged killing Alexander at his suburban Phoenix home on June 4, 2008. She initially denied any involvement and later blamed the attack on masked intruders. Two years after her arrest, Arias said she killed Alexander in self-defense. The victim suffered nearly 30 knife wounds, had his throat slit from ear to ear and was shot in the forehead. Prosecutors say the attack was fueled by jealous rage after Alexander wanted to end his affair with Arias and prepared to take a trip to Mexico with another woman. Jurors convicted Arias on May 8 of first-degree murder, with all 12 unanimously agreeing it was premeditated, after about 15 hours of deliberations over four days. The panel later took less than three hours to determine the killing was especially cruel, meaning the death penalty would be a consideration for sentencing. The ongoing penalty proceedings will be the final phase of the trial. Jurors are expected to begin deliberating Arias' ultimate fate this week. The proceedings will play out like a mini-trial as the prosecutor will be allowed to cross-examine each witness, and both sides will offer closing arguments before the jury begins deliberations. Under Arizona law, if the jury cannot reach a unanimous decision on sentencing, the panel will be dismissed and jury selection will begin anew. Lock down: The cell of convicted killer Jodi Arias at Estrella jail where she awaits the outcome of the death penalty phase of her trial . Another panel would then be seated to hear arguments in only the penalty phase to determine a sentence. If the second panel cannot reach a unanimous agreement, the judge will then sentence Arias to either her entire life in prison or life in prison with the possibility of release after 25 years. The most anticipated part of the penalty phase will be when Arias takes the witness stand, though exactly what she will say remains a mystery. Within minutes of her murder conviction, Arias complicated efforts for her defense when she gave an interview to Fox affiliate KSAZ, saying she preferred death over life in prison. It wasn't clear whether the prosecutor would use those words against her in court, given some experts say it might not work in his favor aimed at securing a death sentence. 'Jodi Arias has proven herself to be a conniving manipulator so she may be saying something like this to get a reaction from the jury,' said San Francisco criminal defense lawyer Michael Cardoza. 'She may be hoping the jury says, ''We won't give her what she wants, and if she wants death, we're giving her life.''' Cardoza noted that in Arias' case, with so much evidence against her, the defense can still claim some level of satisfaction is they can just keep her off death row. Arizona defense attorney Thomas Gorman, who has handled dozens of death penalty cases, said Martinez may not need to mention Arias' comments in the television interview to jurors given they haven't been sequestered throughout the trial. 'They just can't avoid it,' Gorman said. 'If they're at a bar or a restaurant, they're going to see and hear things.' Arias also cannot choose the death penalty. It's up to the jury to determine a sentence. And while death penalty appeals are automatic in Arizona, she could choose not to pursue additional appeals if she indeed wanted to die for her crime. Earlier this week, after Arias' was interviewed post-conviction, her attorneys asked to be allowed to step down from the case, but a judge denied the request. Legal experts say the decision was not a surprising one because the attorneys have a conflict of interest with their own efforts to try and save her life while Arias has said she'd rather die. The motion to withdraw will have no impact on the penalty phase of the trial given jurors are not privy to the filing.",No witnesses will speak in defense of Jodi Arias at her Arizona trial .

Out of all the picturesque beaches in the UK, Thanet in Kent has won the most Blue Flags for its clean beaches. More than 50 English beaches in total met tough new EU standards to receive an award. A further 113 beaches in England are clean enough to be awarded seaside awards, formally called quality coast awards. Thanet won a total of eight flags. Its resorts include Margate and West Wittering. Keeping up standards: The region with the most Blue Flags this year with eight was Thanet in Kent whose resorts include Margate (pictured) The results were announced today by Keep Britain Tidy which administers the Blue Flag and Seaside Award schemes in England. The Blue Flag 55-beach total for 2013 is down on the 79 for last year but beaches this year were subject to much tougher standards. They had to meet a new 'excellent' standard required under the new EU Bathing Waters Directive. Beaches also had to provide information to beach users advising where they can obtain real time information on discharges from nearby combined sewage overflows, if that discharge could temporarily affect the bathing water quality. The Dorset regions of Poole and Bournemouth had four Blue Flags, as did Torbay in Devon and the Isle of Wight, which also had 13 Seaside Awards. Picturesque: Torbay in Devon has four blue flags while Poole and Bournemouth have also been awarded four . Other well-known beaches which were awarded Blue Flags this year included Central Beach in Skegness, Lincolnshire; Lowestoft South Claremont in Suffolk; Martello Bay at Clacton-on-Sea in Essex, and Whitby in Yorkshire. Richard McIlwain, Keep Britain Tidy operations director, said: 'It is fantastic news for everyone who loves visiting the seaside that so many beaches' places will be flying a flag that guarantees the public the best facilities and the cleanest beaches this summer. 'We campaign to improve the quality of our local environment and we know that communities up and down the country love their beaches and understand what an asset they are for their towns' economies. 'We also know that cleaner beaches can be a focal point for stronger communities. Holidaymakers and daytrippers want to visit clean, safe beaches and the sight of the Blue Flag or Seaside Award flying gives them the reassurance that they will.'","The region with the most Blue Flags this year with eight was Thanet, in Kent .

The boss of bungling Olympic security firm G4S could receive a £16million leaving package after spectacularly quitting his post last night. Nick Buckles presided over a ‘humiliating shambles’ after the company failed to train enough guards for last summer’s Games, causing 3,500 soldiers to be called in to plug the gaps. Yet despite public outrage and calls from MPs for him to resign, he clung on as chief executive. Gone: G4S's chief executive Nick Buckles (pictured yesterday) resigned, just months after the firm's Olympics 'shambles' The debacle was one in a string of . scandals for his leadership that included a botched £5billion takeover . in 2011 and a warning about profitability earlier this month. Now Mr Buckles, who had been with the . company for 28 years and was known in the City as a flamboyant . character, is set to pocket millions when he leaves next week. The UK-based security firm traces its roots back to a guarding company founded in Denmark in 1901. G4S was formed when Group 4 merged with Securicor in 2004. The company has a long record of blunders including: . In 1993 Group 4 became the first private company to run prisoner escort services,m and lost seven inmates in three weeks . A year later a hunger striker escaped from Campsfield House detention centre, guarded by Group 4 . In 1997 it emerged the firm had transferred a prisoner between two vans on a petrol station forecourt . Three prisoners escaped from Peterborough Crown Court in 2001 . In . 2011, G4S staff lost a set of cell keys just days after taking over . Birmingham Prison Workers put an electronic tag on criminal Christopher . Lowcock's artificial limb . In 2012 the firm failed to train enough guards for the London Games which meant 3,500 soldiers had to be recalled from leave . In March this year a G4S guard at Heathrow ordered Royal Navy engineer Nicky Howse to change out . of her uniform before flying to the US because it was 'offensive' His annual pay packet was £1.2million – including £336,000 in lieu of pension payments – which he will receive when he leaves. Mr Buckles, who is married with a son . and two daughters, also built up a pension pot valued at £9.5million at . the end of last year. The 51-year-old has also amassed a hoard of . company shares under long-term incentive schemes which would normally . take years to mature. But he may be granted these for free, . adding £4.5million more to his leaving package, at the discretion of the . group’s pay committee. In addition there are another 370,000 . shares under a separate remuneration scheme, which he would also be . likely to receive, worth a further £926,000. Mr Buckles was slammed by MPs for ‘making it up as he went along’ in the run-up to the Games. Keith Vaz, chairman of the home . affairs select committee, said: ‘I am not surprised by Mr Buckles’ decision to leave the company. I had expected this a year ago. I am . astonished by the level of his farewell package.’ G4S had been appointed by the . Government to provide 10,400 guards for the Games – but admitted it . could not meet the demand just days before the Opening Ceremony. The . Army was called in, but even then some venues had insufficient staff. During the Games almost two thirds of . venues were left with a 15 per cent deficit in guard numbers. MPs called . for G4S to be blacklisted from future Government work. But despite being hauled before MPs twice, Mr Buckles kept his post – while a number of deputies lost their jobs. The Government had to draft in additional security helpers from the Armed Forces after G4S failed to fulfill its contract for the Olympic Games . Mr Buckles was grilled by MPs over the Olympics contract last year . In November, the group was stripped of . one of its prisons by the Ministry of Justice following a tender . process. At the time G4S insisted the events were not linked, but City . analysts questioned whether the group could win big Whitehall contracts . with Mr Buckles – who once claimed never to have read a book, saying . ‘I’m not really a book person’ – still at the helm. Since the Games it has not won a major state contract. Earlier this month the company said . its annual profits would be lower than expectations – a bombshell which . sent the group’s shares plunging. Sources say it was the last straw for . investors.","Army was called in after G4S failed to recruit guards for London 2012 .

It has been alleged the medic put in the hours at different organisations and continued to work excessively . An out-of-hours GP failed to spot potentially fatal pregnancy complications while working back-to-back shifts, a hearing has been told. Dr Volker Bornmann worked 'dangerously long' 13-hour shifts for 24 days straight, it is alleged. The German-born medic put in the hours at different organisations and continued to work excessively despite being warned about the risks, it was said. Dr Bornmann, who is now facing a misconduct hearing at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, was told he needed to take at least 24 hours off every seven days but continued to work excessive hours, the panel was told. Concerns . were brought to the attention of the Hampshire NHS Primary Care Trust . in November 2010 after the ABC Locum Agency reported a 'serious clinical . incident' involving a woman who was 38 weeks pregnant. He was working in the . south of England between 2006 and 2010 - almost exclusively as an . out-of-hours GP - for Hampshire PCT, ABC Locums', Solent Locum Services . and the South West Ambulance Service Trust. Dr . Bornmann conducted a telephone triage with the patient but failed to . spot signs of pre-eclampsia, a condition causing high blood pressure in . pregnant women, or arrange a visit to the patient, it is alleged. She later contacted her own doctor and was rushed into hospital with the condition. Dr Bornmann is also accused of failing to provide 'good clinical care' to 11 patients when conducting telephone consultations between 2006 and 2010. Nigel Grundy, for the General Medical Council, said: 'Whether or not there ought to be any criticism of the out of hours services themselves, the GMC say the doctor clearly has a responsibility as a professional to make sure he was not working excessively and therefore not put patients at risk. 'He didn't think it was excessive as his wife was away and he was sleeping during the days to prepare to do these long nights. On one occasion during a consultation with a young child complaining of vomiting and no bowel action for two days he is alleged to have not examined the youngster properly (file picture) 'The pattern of problems may or may not have been related to the GP's hours,' said Mr Grundy. 'Over the next few weeks other concerns were expressed over the doctor's performance and concerns were expressed over the number of hours he was working and whether that had any effect on his clinical performance.' Other alleged failings along with the excessive number of hours worked by Dr Bornmann later emerged when Hampshire PCT began to investigate his work. On one occasion during a consultation with a young child complaining of vomiting and no bowel action for two days he is alleged to have not examined the boy properly, taken an adequate medical history or arranged for the patient to be admitted to hospital. The PCT suspended him in November 2010 and he has not worked in the UK since. The GMC now allege Dr Bornmann's actions amount to misconduct and deficient professional performance. If found guilty he could be banned from working in the UK. The medic, who has returned to Germany, is not attending the hearing and is not represented. In correspondence with the GMC he said: 'From my mind the whole investigation was absolutely unfair from the very beginning.' The allegations have emerged a month after ministers warned the NHS needs to reform the locum system in which doctors are paid up to £2,000 a shift. The hearing continues.

Boss: Chief executive Moya Greene defended the huge amount of unwanted 'marketing mail' Royal Mail delivers . Although most of it ends up in the bin, postmen should still treat junk mail with ‘utter respect’, the head of the Royal Mail said yesterday. Announcing a 60 per cent increase in profits to £324million, Moya Greene defended the huge amount of unwanted ‘marketing mail’ it delivers. She said junk mail had contributed to the state-owned company’s profits, together with an increase in the price of stamps and the delivery of a record number of parcels, mostly as a result of internet shopping. There is no limit to how much junk mail – formally known as ‘unaddressed mail’ – can be delivered every day. Yesterday Miss Greene, the Royal Mail chief executive, said the company generated £1.1billion from its marketing mail division last year. She said: ‘We must treat every single piece of mail with utter respect because we need it. It [marketing mail] is a very important way that businesses rely upon us for growth.’ Over the last year, she said the total amount of junk mail delivered by the company had increased by around 200million items to around 3.3billion. Miss Greene, who enjoys a total pay package of £1.1million a year, yesterday insisted junk mail is ‘a very important strategy’ for the firm. As more households go over to ‘paperless’ bills which are sent online, the Royal Mail hopes to deliver larger  quantities of junk mail. Overall, the amount of ‘addressed’ mail has dropped from 63million items a day to 58million a day. Postage: Junk mail has contributed to the state-owned company's profits, together with an increase in the price of stamps and the delivery of a record number of parcels, mostly as a result of internet shopping .

'Not only is it a nuisance to . have to pick up and throw away, but it adds thousands of tonnes to the . amount of waste councils have to collect.’ Royal Mail is being prepared for a controversial flotation on the stock market which is bitterly opposed by the trade unions. Dave Ward, deputy general secretary of . the Communication Workers Union, said: ‘The positive results are more . compelling evidence of why Royal Mail should be kept in the public . sector.’ 'We must treat every single piece of mail with utter respect because we need it.

After the years of darkness that William Petit lived through in the aftermath of his family's massacre, the bereaved husband and father was craving light - his new wife stepped in to brighten his life in every way possible. Petit met Christine Paluf, a photographer, not long after two men broke into his home in Cheshire, Connecticut, beat him unconscious, raped and strangled his wife, Jennifer, tied up their daughters and then torched the home. She has now released new pictures of their new home and life together and explained how they have found peace in Western Connecticut. When the killers went on trial in 2011, Paluf was there for Petit, sitting behind him in the courthouse along with his relatives and listening to hours of agonizing testimony. Power of love: Dr William Petit credits his new wife, Christina Paluf, with helping him every day and night deal with the trauma of the 2007 tragedy that has robbed him of his family . Woman's touch: The Petits painted the walls of the living room white, and Christine filled the cozy room with cheerful purple and lavender touches, as well as a large white dandelion-shaped chandelier . Last year, Petit and Paluf got married and moved into a small but cozy home in Farmington River in western Connecticut. The Petits painted the walls of the living room white, and Christine Paluf filled the cozy space with cheerful purple and lavender touches, as well as a large white dandelion-shaped chandelier. 'This was all dark. All dark. Then she put these funky lights in. Put a new floor in, got rid of some furniture,' Petit told Esquire Magazine. Sleeping in a small room overlooking the water, Petit has finally begun to find peace. In the years after the murders, the former endocrinologist dreaded the night and all the traumatic memories and irrational fears that would creep into his mind in the dark. But now, with the calm, reassuring presence of his new wife by his side, Petit has learned to welcome the hour when he retires to bed every night. However, he still counts the days, hours and minutes since his daughters died in the worst way imaginable. Since his wife was raped and strangled. The nightmares still come, but Petit keeps on going. 'You do what you have to do, you just keep going,' he says. With a new wife, a new home and a new purpose, the sole survivor of the brutal home invasion has done what many could not do. He keeps on living. His second wife Christine Paluf Petit, 36, has been a rock, always being there with him and for him  even if it means just to silently hold his hand. Enlarge .

On a good night the 56-year-old will get five hours sleep, on a bad, two. He keeps lights on in the living room through the night. Speaking to Esquire magazine, he reveals he used to wake up like clockwork at 3am every morning - the time the brutal home invasion commenced - with the images of the men carved into his mind. He said: 'In the beginning when I couldn't sleep, it was always that night. It was always late at night since it started at two or three in the morning. 'I'd be bolt awake at 3am just . like clockwork, no matter what. And then it sorta switched to mornings. The mornings got bad. It would just always be right in front of me. Right in front of your face.' After their emotional wedding ceremony last year, which they shared with 300 family and friends, William and Christine moved into a new home on Farmington River in western Connecticut. They chose to sleep in the smaller bedroom rather than the master bedroom because it faced the water - bringing with it the view and peace they crave. It is a new home away from the Cheshire home William shared with his wife Jennifer for 18 years, where his daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, grew up. And also the place were they breathed their last breaths. William has not returned there since that fateful Sunday in July 2007. Throughout his sorrow and his grief, Christine has been a constant.

Through everything, Christine is a constant. Early in their relationship she learned how to be there for him when he was in a dark place but not say anything, she would just quietly hold his hand. He would thank her for that - for not doing anything - which is just what he needed at that time. Sometimes she makes jokes with him, trying to lift his mood when it drops. Sometimes she will refer to Jennifer, as she never wants him to forget one minute of the life he used to live. 'You don't like doing dishes do you? How'd that go over with Jennifer?' she'd tease, and Bill would laugh. Christine is determined to keep things light, happy and fun. She has decorated their new home from a dreary place to one filled with light and colors, voices and laughter. She met her husband when she was working at the Farmington Country Club, but they didn't make a connection until she offered her skills as a photographer to the Petit Family Foundation. She liked him from the beginning, but was unsure whether he liked her. She told Esquire magazine how she watched him grow and heal as time went on from behind her camera lens. She said: 'I watched him for years at those events, because I had to photograph him. And it was years before I could even get a smile. 'But then he sorta started to - you could just see things changing. Things were starting to lift just a little. 'And then there was this humor that was just shocking.

They were all answered, even when there were no return addresses, the Petits found them. The donations still come in. Among one of William's favorites, according to Esquire magazine, are from three little brothers who, every year at their birthday parties, ask friends to make a donation to the foundation instead of buying a present. William thinks people understand the mission statement - to foster the education of young people, especially women in the sciences, to improve the lives of those affected by chronic illnesses and to support efforts to protect and help those affected by violence. The house burned down beyond any salvation, the building and its foundation had to be razed and carted away. Residents of the affluent cul-de-sace turned it into a memorial garden - though William never goes there.

Support: The family of Petit's deceased wife have wished him and Paluf the world of happiness . Together: The couple were joined by 300 friends and relatives at the wedding in West Hartford on Sunday . Soon after that July night, William's brother-in-law and a few others went over to the house and uprooted the garden. They took out the four o' clocks - Michaela's favorite flowers which she helped her dad plant in the back yard. Now the seeds of these are placed in . small packages inside brochures that say 'Michaela's Garden' and sold . for $10 for the foundation. Three hundred thousand seeds have been . harvested so far.

Since the couple announced the pregnancy in December, artists and forensic experts from across the globe have put forward their impressions of the how the world's most eagerly anticipated baby will look. But South Africa-based genetic counsellor Suretha Erasamus has gone further and is one of the first to predict the face of the royal in adolescence. Face of a royal? If the couple have a daughter it is predicted she will look like her mother and have a good chance of inheriting Kate's dark hair but may inherit William's mouth and strong jawline if it is a boy . Ms Erasamus works with families to help them understand and make decisions about genetic conditions. But she has taken her skills and helped create a best guess of what the future King or Queen will look like. Graphic artist Theuns Kruger developed the images based on her predictions. With their strong jawlines and bright . blue eyes, the resemblance between the images of the teenage girl and . boy and their parents is clear to see.

However, instead of Kate's green . eyes,  teenage princess is depicted with the blue eyes of . Princess Diana and Prince William. The teenage girl in the computer . generated image has strong echoes of both Kate and Princess Diana but also . shares a likeness to Prince William's first cousins Eugenie and . Beatrice. If the Duke and Duchess have a boy, then Erasamus believes he will much more closely resemble his father as a teenager. It is predicted the baby will have his mother's dark hair rather than the blonde hair of its paternal grandmother . However, she said the baby is likely to bear some of the facial characteristics of Princess Diana because of the strong resemblance between Prince William and his mother . In the image, he shares William's strong jawline and has his mouth and teeth. But he will have the darker, arched eyebrows of his mother. Such is William's strong likeness to . his mother that Erasamus believes there is a good chance the royal baby will . also look similar to Princess Diana.

Olympic star Lindsey Vonn, who has been seeing Woods for several months, has visited to the Red Bull-owned Diagnostics and Training Centre in Austria, which is run by German doctor Bernd Pansold, 71, according to an investigation by the New York Daily News. Pansold was one of hundreds of doctors at the forefront of a doping epidemic in the former East Germany, which fed unwitting young athletes hardcore performance enhancing drugs like anabolic steroids in what was a state-sponsored programme in the 1970s and 80s. While there is no suggestion alpine ski champion Vonn, who is sponsored by Red Bull, has ever taken PEDs - and has never failed a dope test - her visits to Pansold, who runs the lab in the village of Thalgau, shows how vulnerable today's Olympic stars are to the murky past of doping. When confronted with suggestions Vonn has been a visitor to the facility, her publicist initially denied it, but later acknowledged the 28-year-old had undertaken tests at the lab and had exchanged nothing more than pleasantries with the doctor. It is thought she made visits to have physiological tests, including blood-lactate analysis. Pansold, in an interview in March, confirmed Vonn had visited his facility twice a year and called her a 'very nice girl'. Vonn is one of the most famous skiers in the world and is the poster girl for the US team . Woods and Vonn are America's latest golden couple . He emphasised the primary influence behind Vonn's training programme is Red Bull trainer Martin Hager. Vonn, winner of four World Championships, has been sponsored by the energy drink company since 2005, which is said to give her a number of perks, including other state-of-art training facilities at the company-sponsored Salzburg football team's headquarters. What is unclear is how much Vonn and her handlers know about Pansold's questionable past. Thousands of fledgling athletes suffered at the hands of the East German doctors, and it is thought Pansold was at the heart of a programme which plied female competitors with highly dangerous muscle-strengthening drugs. Doctor Bernd Pansold on the day of his doping trial in the 1990s and former German swimmer Kristin Otto, who was unknowingly given steroids during the height of the scandal in the 1980s . Girls as young as 13 were given the toxic Oral Turinabol without their knowledge. The victims suffered side effects such as deepened voices, cancer, ruined ovulation cycles and an increase in face and body hair growth. In 1998, Pansold was convicted of aiding and abetting assault for his part in the programme. He has admitted in the past that, 'It's very clear I was part of this system. I’m a known guy, but there are 200 or 300 other people you can ask'. He was hired by Red Bull in 2000 and is now a specialist in analysing physical testing data to see how performance can improve. There is no suggestion he continued to be involved in doping since the East Germany scandal. Red Bull did not respond to the paper's request for comment about the doctor, while Vonn has not been made available by her handlers to talk about him.","Star skier made visits to clinic overseen by notorious doctor, Bernd Pansold .

Up to 600 Afghans who have risked their lives to act as interpreters for British troops and officials are to be handed the right to move to Britain. Interpreters who have regularly served on the front line will get visas for themselves and their ‘immediate dependents’ to come to Britain for a period of five years. Under a £40 million package being thrashed out in Whitehall, those who come to the UK they will get free travel to the UK and accommodation paid for their first three months. Vital role: An Afghan interpreter, his face masked for security . purposes, pictured with Prince Harry in 2008. Up to 600 Afghans who . have worked as interpreters are to be given the right to move to Britain . The visas will be offered to around half of the 1,200 interpreters who are currently employed by the Armed Forces and the Foreign Office. Those eligible will have had to serve for at least 12 months ‘outside the wire’ of security compounds in Helmand province where British troops have been fighting the Taliban. Those who do not qualify for . emigration to the UK will be offered the choice of 18 months’ pay as or . money for training and education for up to five years if they want to . learn a skill or take an IT course. Interpreters . who are no longer employed by Britain will not get a redundancy package . but if they feel their lives are in danger they can report threats . under the UK’s intimidation policy, which offers relocation to Britain . in ‘extreme cases’. The package has been drawn up in . Downing Street following warnings that the Taliban could execute . interpreters once Western combat forces leave the country by the end of . next year. Interpreter Mohammad Rafi Hottak was tortured by the Taliban for helping the British Army in Afghanistan . A recent private survey of interpreters who have worked for Britain found that 94 per cent of respondents had received threats since they started working for the British. Fewer than 3 per cent of interpreters said they will feel safe in Afghanistan when UK forces withdraw. Twenty interpreters have died since 2001 - five were abducted and murdered by insurgents. The US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have all granted Afghan interpreters the right to asylum. If all 600 interpreters decide to move to Britain it will cost taxpayers around £30 million. The cost of redundancy payments and training will add another £10 million to the bill. After the Iraq War all locally engaged staff were offered the chance to move to the UK. But No 10 officials say the package this time offers more incentives for them to remain in their own country. Officials also make the point that many interpreters come from Northern Afghanistan rather than Helmand and will simply return home to communities who do not know that they have been working for Britain. The plan has been approved by David Cameron and officials in the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence after meetings of the National Security Council. The details of the plans have now been passed to other ministers across Whitehall for approval. A No10 source: ‘The Prime Minister has been very clear that we should not turn our backs on those who have trod the same path as our soldiers in Helmand, consistently putting their lives at risk to help our troops achieve their mission. ‘We should recognise the service given by those who have regularly put themselves in real danger while working for us. ‘These proposals give them a choice: the opportunity to go on working in Afghanistan, learning new skills and to go on rebuilding their country or to come and make a new start in Britain.’","Interpreters will get visas for themselves and their ‘immediate dependents’

A blind anti-abortion activist forced to flee China after suffering years of torture and persecution has accused the British government of running scared from Beijing. Chen Guangcheng is in the UK to receive an award for exposing the plight of hundreds of thousands of Chinese women forced to undergo abortions and sterilisations as part of China's strict one-child policy. But his request to meet with the Prime Minister David Cameron and Foreign Secretary William Hague during his five-day visit has been snubbed because Downing Street fears 'further punishment' from Beijing and will lose out on trade deals. Snub: Chen Guangcheng (right), Chinese human rights activist pictured outside the Oxford Union just before he gave his speech and David Cameron (left) Mr Cameron was forced to cancel a trip to China last month because the Communist Party-run Chinese government refused him high level meetings. Beijing remains incensed over Cameron's meeting with the exiled Tibetan leader the Dalai Lama 12 months ago, and has frozen all high level diplomatic contact since - minister Kenneth Clarke was also forced to abandon a trade trip late last month. Beijing is demanding Downing Street publicly admit Cameron's encounter with the Dalai Lama was a mistake. But Chen – who last year escaped from house arrest and claimed asylum at the US embassy – warned Cameron that his kowtowing to Beijing and placing trade above human rights was damaging Britain's international reputation as a nation of democratic values and freedom. 'The British government will not meet with me because they are scared of upsetting the Chinese government. But I tell David Cameron and his ministers that I am not scared of Beijing,' said a defiant Chen last night after picking up the Westminster Award for his human rights work at the Houses of Parliament. 'The British Government is letting down its people by refusing to see me. This country has for centuries, from the slave trade to Nazism, faced-up to dictators, fascism and oppression. This is not what the British people vote for,' Mr Chen told MailOnline. A petitioner trying to attract public attention is taken away by policemen outside a hospital where blind activist Chen Guangcheng was kept in Beijing last year . The British people have long supported the hundreds of thousands of Chinese women who are forced to abort their babies or undergo sterilisation every day, he said. 'But now their government is turning his back on the issue because he thinks trade is more important,' Chen added. Visibly upset, Chen retold the plight of one woman forced into detention for breaching the one-child policy by becoming pregnant for a second time. She was taken to prison and forced to leave her three year old daughter at home. 'The officials refused to let her organise proper child care or even make a call to relatives. The girl was found dead three weeks later,' he said. Chen was given his award by Conservative MP Fiona Bruce, who was embarrassed on learning about the snubs for her guest by her bosses. Chen Guangcheng is on a brief visit to the UK, to talk about his life as a political activist . 'Cabinet ministers have very busy diaries. I know that some senior Foreign Office officials have agreed to meet with Mr Chen during his trip,' she said. Lord Alton of Liverpool, who attended the award ceremony, also called on Britain and other Western governments to exert pressure on China about its human rights towards women. 'Make no mistake, this is war. China's one policy caused more violence against women girls than any other policy on earth – than any official policy in the history of the world,' he said. The Chinese Government claims 13 million abortions are carried out each year in China – that amounts to 1,458 every hour in what many describe as a state-sanctioned gendercide. But activists like Chen claim the true number is much greater and many women are forced into abortions at eight months or later. Many of those who resist are forced into brutal 're-education through labour' camps. 'I call on the British people to lobby their government to take up this issue with Beijing and remain true to the values that make Britain a respected country throughout the world. Improving human rights in China will help global trade and economic recovery, not the opposite,' he said. Chen evaded walls, security cameras and guards who kept him under house arrest for one and half years in his small rural village in eastern China a year ago. Helped by a network of supporters and following a car chase, he found refuge for six days in the United States Embassy in Beijing. Faced with an embarrassing international stand-off, Chinese and US officials agreed to let him and his wife leave China to go into exile in the US. His relatives who remain in China are regularly persecuted by officials, Chen said. The Foreign Office denied Mr Chen had been snubbed by Downing Street. A spokeswoman said: 'The UK's relationship with China is broader and deeper than ever. Inevitably there are some issues on which we disagree. 'So long as both sides handle our differences in a balanced and reasonable way there is no reason why our bilateral relationship should not develop further and faster.'","Chen Guangcheng is in UK to receive award for exposing 'gendercide'

A key adviser to Lord Justice Leveson last night threw plans for regulating the media into turmoil by denouncing the idea of a Royal Charter to oversee a new regulator for Britain’s Press. Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil rights group Liberty, said it was ‘constitutionally inappropriate, undemocratic, opaque and in no way fit for this purpose’. She rejected two rival versions of a Royal Charter, one drawn up in late night talks between the three main political parties and the Hacked Off pressure group, and another by the industry. Unimpressed: Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil rights group Liberty, said the idea of a Royal Charter to oversee a new regulator for Britain's Press was 'constitutionally inappropriate, undemocratic and opaque' Miss Chakrabarti, one of six ‘assessors’ who guided the Leveson Inquiry, suggested the Press could set up its own self-regulatory body, with the power to issue fines of up to £1million and direct prominent apologies, without waiting for the Privy Council to decide on the way forward. She proposed that Parliament should pass legislation to set the criteria for a new regulator and the courts be given the job of deciding if those criteria are met. But a senior industry figure said last night: ‘The problem with this proposal is that it means politicians will be writing the rules, and the judiciary will be charged with seeing that they are obeyed. ‘Neither is compatible with a free Press – and the judiciary are likely to have grave reservations about becoming involved in such a contentious issue as oversight of a Press regulator.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Shami Chakrabarti slams idea of Royal Charter to oversee new regulator .

Ben Thompson, 34, a Welsh rugby fan who died when he fell into a river after drinking while watching the opening game of the Six Nations tournament at the Millennium Stadium . A husband who won a 'free bar' for a Six Nations rugby match was killed when he fell into a river after an eight-hour drinking session, an inquest heard. Ben Thompson, 34, tumbled into the water as he tried to walk back to his hotel after drinking in an executive hospitality box. The engineer, of Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, had won a £250-a-head hospitality package through work and was wined and dined as he watched Wales play Ireland at the Millennium Stadium. Mr Thompson and fellow business colleagues had started drinking as early as 10.15am on the day of the game. The drink and food was laid on in the plush box  and he kept on drinking until till 6.15pm when he left a bar. His body was found more than a month later in the River Ely in Cardiff after he fell in while trying to find his hotel. His wife told how excited Mr Thompson had kissed her goodbye to travel to Cardiff for the game. But he never came home - and his widow Joanne, 38, today warned sports fans to be careful how much they drink. She said: 'I don't want anyone else to have to go through what I have gone through. 'We all go out and have a few drinks but don't go mad - something like this can happen to anyone. 'I would just like to tell other people to be careful, look after yourself, stay in touch with their friends, let them know what they are doing. 'Wives, please tell your partners to behave themselves.' Heartbreak: Mr Thompson with his wife Joanne. They had been married for six years . She added: 'Ben was my husband but I have been left alone because of this tragic set of circumstances.' Fit and healthy Mr Thompson, who worked at South Hook LNG Terminal Site, in Pembrokeshire,  travelled 100 miles from his home to the Welsh capital for the first match in this year's Six Nations tournament in February. He had been given tickets as a prize from work. Joanne told the court: 'I hate it when he goes away, but when he went he kissed me and said don't worry, it's only two nights. The Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, where Ben spent much of the day drinking . Final journey: CCTV footage shows Mr Thompson trying to walk back to his hotel . 'He was so excited about going to Cardiff and he was overjoyed that he had won tickets to the game.' Mr Thompson started his day off at the Yard pub in the city centre where he had 'two or three drinks'. Cardiff Coroners Court heard how he then went to the Millennium Stadium and drank there for up to five hours. Mrs Thompson, who was married for six years, added: 'He called me after the match, he was shouting and telling me he was on the way to 10 Feet Tall - which was our favourite pub in Cardiff. 'I could tell he was half cut because he kept repeating himself - that was the last time I spoke to him.' Mr Thompson and and his colleagues drank 'all sorts of rounds and shorts' late into the evening. Friends left him queuing to get into a city centre branch of O'Neills Irish Bar but he never made it inside. Manhunt: A search was launched after the engineer disappeared . Mr Thompson's body was found in the river Ely, a month after he went missing . Mrs Thompson added: 'Ben was extremely fit and health-conscious, his metabolism was so good - this must have affected his ability to handle alcohol. 'He was not a frequent drinker but he would binge drink with his work colleagues - they were all quite big but he felt like he had to keep up with them. 'They would call people names if they couldn't drink as much and Ben didn't like that.' The keen cyclist and hiker tried to walk more than 15 miles back to the hotel he was staying at on the outskirts of the city. She added: 'He would rather walk home than catch a taxi - distance wasn't an issue, he would walk for miles if needed. Missing: Officers search wasteland close to where the Pembrokeshire resident disappeared . A witness who saw him not long before he died said he appeared drunk . 'I told him not to binge drink. I told him that one day he would never come home - I didn't think it would actually happen.' Mr Thompson's disappearance sparked a massive manhunt across Cardiff with search parties and sniffer dogs looking for the rugby fan. His last movements captured on CCTV showed him staggering down a dead end lane leading to wasteland and the river. Debra Sexton was one of the last people to see him alive. In a statement read to the court she said: 'I remember thinking to myself: ""Gosh he's drunk"". 'He was walking side to side, taking one step forward and two back - but he seemed to be walking with a purpose, he seemed to be know where he was going. Pathologist Meleri Morgan said that hitting the cold water while drunk could have caused a heart attack or his throat to close . 'I thought he must be cold because he wasn't wearing a coat, I thought he was vulnerable because he was so drunk.' The body was finally found in the River Ely in March - more than a month after he vanished. PC Gareth Davies said when Mr Thompson's pockets were emptied they found an Ireland v Wales Six Nations badge and change from the rounds of drink he had bought. Pathologist Meleri Morgan said that hitting the cold water while drunk could have caused a heart attack or his throat to close.

Cardiff coroner Miss Mary Hassell recorded a verdict of accidental death and said the cause of death was sudden immersion in water having taken alcohol. She said: 'Ben did as literally thousands of other men did on that day, he went out, he watched the game and tried to walk home. 'He just had the misfortune to slip or trip and fall into the water - he died as soon as he entered the water.'","Ben Thompson, 34, fell into river after eight hours of drinking .

An Episcopal priest has been yanked from post after being accused of directly plagiarizing sermons he gave and even published in his own name since 2006. Rev. John McGinn, 65, led the congregation of St. John’s Episcopal in the Cape Cod town of Sandwich, Massachusetts since 1993. That is, until recently when he was put on administrative leave for allegedly stealing sermons. They came, nearly verbatim, from a book called ‘Dynamic Preaching’ that is only available via an online subscription service at Sermons.com. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... Thou shalt not steal: From the tiny St. John's Episcopal Church Father John McGinn (pictured) gave sermons for years that he likely cribbed straight from Sermons.com . The 300 or so families who normally attend McGinn’s sermons in the little wood-shingled village church received a letter May 9 from the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts explaining what exactly had become of their spiritual guide. ‘This is a serious breach of the pastoral relationship between John and each of you,’ wrote Bishop M. Thomas Shaw. ‘I am sorry that this matter has caused pain and will likely cause further pain in the parish.’ McGinn first raised the eyebrows of church elders a year ago when officials approached him with similar accusations. However, friar assured them it was an isolated incident that would not happen again. ‘We investigated further,’ wrote Shaw, ‘and have documentation that  not only did he continue to copy sermons and preach and publish them verbatim, in print and online, as his own, but he had been doing so for many years.’ Parish the thought: McGinn led the congregation at St. John's in the Cape Cod town of Sandwich, Massachusetts since 1993 but was recently placed on administrative leave . As an example, the Diocese pointed to a December 2011 sermon given by McGinn in which he told a detailed story about a man who had ‘Jingle Bells’ sung at his funeral instead of ‘Glory Bells.’ The same story, investigators found, had been used at other churches before. Meanwhile, the opening line of McGinn’s version includes an aside about just how unbelievable some of his supposedly true tales can seem. ‘I keep saying that one of these days I'm going to sit down and write a book because some of the things that have happened in my ministry need to be written down so that people can read them,’ he said in the sermon, which was still on the church’s sermon as of Friday. Pilfered preaching: The Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts says McGinn has been stealing sermons word-for-word since at least 2006 . Rev. Mally Lloyd of the Diocese office said there were other instances. As many as 15, according to the Cape Cod Times. And McGinn, says Shaw, isn’t denying any of it. ‘He admits to having done so,’ he wrote. The diocese is now ‘working out a final agreement’ with the priest. So what becomes of a shamed priest after many years in the cloth? Not a tortured existence, it appears. ‘I'm going to retire,’ the unabashed McGinn said. ‘I loved my time at the parish. That's all. I think I did a good job.’ C'est la vivum: McGinn reportedly admitted to the plagiarism. 'I'm going to retire,' he said.

Motorway service stations may be forced to advertise the prices their rivals charge for fuel, under Government plans to clamp down on ‘rip-off’ charges. David Cameron has ordered a review of motorway fuel prices after an Office of Fair Trading report this year found they were significantly higher than at normal petrol stations. The study in January found that petrol prices on the motorway are 7.5p per litre higher than on the average forecourt. Diesel prices are an average 8.3p per litre higher. Petrol stations on motorways could be forced to advertise the fuel prices of near rivals in a bid to stop drivers being ripped off . The Office of Fair Trading found it cost £72.20 to fill a car with petrol from a motorway services station, compared to £66.70 from a supermarket . Ministers are interested in learning lessons from France, which forces service stations to advertise their rivals’ prices to boost competition. Government sources said Mr Cameron had asked the Downing Street policy unit to investigate options for bringing prices down. ‘The Prime Minister has asked the policy unit to prioritise cost of living issues,’ a source said. ‘This is one area where we believe transparency can drive down prices and give motorists a better deal. ‘The problem on the motorway is that the fuel prices are only advertised on the forecourt. ‘That is the legal requirement. But by the time you’ve pulled off the motorway and stopped, it is often more trouble than it’s worth to go on to the next service station, particularly as you’ve got no idea whether it will be any cheaper.’ The policy review has been ordered by David Cameron, who is on a three-day visit to the United States where he yesterday held talks with President Barack Obama . The OFT report found that higher costs could only partially explain the inflated fuel prices found on motorways, where drivers are often unable to look for a better deal. The study suggested that the lack of transparency about prices on the motorway was a potentially significant factor in the higher charges. The Downing Street policy unit has now drawn up a series of options for reform. As a minimum, service stations are likely to be required to advertise their fuel prices at the roadside, so that drivers can make a decision before they pull off. The Department for Transport has also been asked to investigate whether Highways Agency signs could be used to display information about fuel prices on the motorway. And officials will consider whether to copy the French model that requires service station operators to advertise the prices of their rivals. Under this option, operators could be forced to display not only their own prices, but also those of the next two service stations on the motorway. The Office of Fair Trading said sharp rises in fuel prices was cause by increases in tax and not price-fixing by oil companies . Pre-tax petrol prices in the UK are amongst the lowest in Europe, the OFT said . The prices would be shown on the motorway, giving drivers the option of continuing to the next service station if it is offering a better deal. A formal consultation on the issue is likely to be issued by the DfT later this year. Although the reforms will not force operators to cut their charges, ministers believe the increased transparency should drive down prices. The review is part of a wider drive within Government to tackle the soaring cost of living, which ministers fear will be a major issue at the next . election. Mr Cameron is also under pressure from his own MPs, who have identified fuel prices as the single biggest cost of living concern. The RAC last night welcomed the initiative and called for it to be expanded to include service station food. RAC spokesman Pete Williams said motorway drivers had ‘long been victims of some pretty indefensible pricing’. He added: ‘This is welcome news for motorists and commercial drivers alike but we still need motorway services to be transparent and fair on all their prices.  They have held the motorist to ransom for far too long.’","David Cameron orders clamp down on rip off charges on motorways .

Diplomats in London have racked up a staggering £70 million in unpaid congestion charge fines, it emerged today. Over the past ten years foreign embassies have accumulated more than 600,000 penalty charge notices after refusing to pay the controversial charge. Transport for London today said . embassies now owed £70,068,175 - and named and shamed the biggest . culprits - with the U.S topping the list. Controversial: Diplomats in London have racked up a staggering £70 million in unpaid congestion charge fines, it emerged today. The U.S embassy, pictured, topped the list of those racking up the biggest charges . Over the past ten years, our Atlantic ally has picked up 66,372 penalty charge notices totalling £7.5 million - an increase of £1.2 in the last year alone. Japan is the second most prolific offender, owing Transport for London £5.08 million while the Russians have £4.95 million in unpaid fines. Making up the top five are the Nigerian high commission on £4 million and the German embassy, which owes £3.8 million. The congestion charge, which brings in around £110 million a year, currently costs £10 and is active in certain areas of London from 7am to 6pm on weekdays. For the £70 million owed by embassies, TfL could employ 3,000 bus drivers for a year or pay for 368 double-decker buses. Bill: Many foreign embassies refuse to pay the controversial charge, which was launched in 2003. This file picture shows a congestion charge zone . The total of unpaid embassy charges has rocketed by £15 million in the last year alone - a rate of £57,000 per working day. And the cost of not paying the congestion charge is going to rise on Monday, from £120 to £130. Around one quarter of embassies refuse to pay the charge, calling it a tax, as diplomats are exempt from paying local taxes under the 1960 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Despite this, TfL is not giving up and has been advised by lawyers to take the matter to the Internationals Court of Justice. However, this will require government support and TfL is currently waiting for a response from the Foreign Office. John Mason, TfL director responsible for the Congestion Charge, said: 'We and the UK Government are clear that the congestion charge is a charge for a service and not a tax. 'This means that diplomats are not exempt from paying it. 'Around three quarters of embassies in London do pay the charge, but there remains a stubborn minority who refuse to do so, despite our representations through diplomatic channels. 'TfL will continue to pursue all unpaid congestion charge fees and related penalty charge notices and are pushing for the matter to be taken up at the International Court of Justice.' Since it was introduced in February 2003, the Congestion Charge has generated more than £1.2 billion in revenue. Around £960 million of this has been spent on improvements to the bus network, £102 million has gone on roads and bridges and £70 million on road safety. Mr Mason added: 'Recovering unpaid penalties incurred by vehicles registered outside the UK can be problematic and is a well-known issue for traffic authorities such as TfL. 'Nevertheless, we work hard with our European debt recovery agency to recover penalties in relation to non-UK registered vehicles where it is possible to do so.'","Embassies have accumulated more than 600,000 penalty charge notices .

Initial estimates put the death toll at 91 reported in Moore, the Oklahoma City suburb ravaged by Monday's tornado that packed winds of up to 200 mph. This morning authorities said that number came from the chaotic aftermath of the storm and there are only 24 confirmed casualties. They still, however, expect that number to rise.

Heartbreaking: A woman carries a child through a field near the collapsed Plaza Towers Elementary School. Many parents still have no idea where there children are . 'I . don't know where she's at,' Sharp said. Later, she went to speak to . officials who helped her register so she could be notified as soon as . her daughter was found. Shelli . Smith had to walk miles to find her children. She was reunited with her . 14-year-old daughter, Tiauna, around 5 p.m. Monday, but hadn't yet seen . her 16-year-old son, TJ, since he left for school that morning. TJ's phone had died, but he borrowed a classmate's phone to tell his mother where he was. However, Smith couldn't get to him due to the roadblocks. So she parked her car and started walking. It took her three hours, but a little . after sunset, she found him. Devastating: The giant two-mile wide tornado has left up to 91 people dead . Lucky: This boy was pulled from beneath a collapsed wall at the Plaza Towers Elementary School. Some parents have described walking for hours in order to be reunited with their children . Devastation: Two girls stand in rubble after the two mile-wide tornado struck . She grabbed her son and squeezed him in a . tight hug that lasted for several seconds before letting go. TJ hugged . his sister, and then hugged his mom again. The family had a long walk back to their car and then home, but she said she didn't mind. 'I . was trying to get him and they wouldn't let me,' she said, adding . later: 'I was like, 'You know what? 'I'm going to get my son.' Renee Lee summed up the struggle for many parents with multiple children - find the ones who they hadn't yet seen, while calming the younger ones they had with them. Another person waiting for news was Mark Troxell. The youngest of nine is waiting at the OU Trauma Center to hear news about his older brother Mark, who he fears was caught in the center of the storm. 'What I heard is he was opening the front door and then his house blew away,'  Troxwell told KFOR.COM. 'Wait, that’s all we can do is wait,' Mark Troxell said. Horrific: As many as 20 children are feared dead following the devastating tornado. This man hugs his neighbor outside her home . Valor: Rescue workers help free injured survivors of the storm in Moore after a tornado tore through the area . Exhausted: Children wait for their parents to arrive at Briarwood Elementary School . Lee is the mother of two daughters . Sydney Walker, 16, and Hannah Lee, 8. When the storm came, she tried to . pick Sydney up from school. Sydney . told her on the phone that they wouldn't let her come in. While Lee and . her younger daughter waited in their home, which wasn't hit, Sydney was . safe in the room at a local high school. Lee said she believed Sydney wasn't hurt and seemed resigned to the severe weather outbreaks. 'There's been so many of them, it doesn't even faze me,' she said. 'You just do what you gotta do. It's part of living here.' One family have made a desperate appeal for information. Janae Hornsby, 9, was a student at the destroyed Plaza Towers Elementary School. Her father told KOCO.COM that she is a vivacious loveable little girl who 'always has a smile on her face'. The devastating wait for parents of Plaza students was made worse as officials seemed to signal an end to their hopes of retrieving more people alive from the flattened school. 'They’re looking for life, but they have not had any hits recently, so they’re in recovery mode now,' Gov. Mary Fallin said late Monday.","Parents of missing children wait at St. Andrews United Methodist Church .

An illegal immigrant who fled war-torn Afghanistan after his father and brother were murdered by militants has lost his his fight to remain in the UK. Najibullah Hashimi, 19, has been living in England ever since fleeing his war-torn homeland as a youngster, and has settled in well, achieving 13 GCSEs, settling down with a foster family and becoming a valued member of Rodmersham Cricket Club in Kent. Mr Hashimi and crowds of supporters - including his foster father’s two young sons, who refer to the Afghan national as 'brother' - put forward a case for a right to remain in the UK last month, but today his foster father said Mr Hashimi had failed in his appeal to stay. Najibullah Hashimi will be deported back to Afghanistan, despite achieving 13 GCSEs and settling in the UK . Mr Hashimi has settled happily in life in the UK with his foster family and is devastated that he has to go to Kabul . However, a letter from the Home . Office has since confirmed Mr Hashimi has failed in his appeal, and will . be sent to Kabul - despite hearing his concerns that his life will be . in danger. Steve Griffiths, his foster father, . today said Mr Hashimi, whom he described as 'a broken man', will be sent . to Kabul after a letter from the Home Office confirmed he would have to . leave the UK. But he said his foster son's solicitor may yet contest the decision. He said: 'We are all devastated. My family, my two boys - they cannot believe this. 'We are all very worried for Najib. He is part of our family, he is part of our lives - you couldn’t meet a nicer fellow. 'Najib has settled here, he has done . very well in his education and he wants to give something back. There . were so many people from throughout the community who went to support . Najib ahead of the court hearing last month, we all want him here.' Since arriving in the UK unable to speak English, Najibullah has embraced English life and is a cricket coach . The teenager fled war-torn Afghanistan and says he has no home or relatives to return to . He said Mr Hashimi and his solicitor have until the end of the week to consider what course of action they will take next. Mr Griffiths said: 'Najib’s absolutely beside himself. He is worried for his life, and he doesn’t want to leave here. 'As we understand it, he will simply be flown to Kabul and then left to face it alone. It’s terrible.' Last month’s tribunal was told how Mr . Hashimi, who moved to the UK unable to speak the language, was 'treated . like a son and a brother' to his foster family - Mr Griffiths, his wife . Michelle and their children, Tyler, 10, and Finlay, eight. His girlfriend, 15-year-old Lucy Pearce, also said how she relied on her 'inspirational boyfriend' for support. 'I have lost one family five years ago - I don't want to lose the second.  When I am with them, it's like nothing has happened to me.' Najibullah Hashimi, 19, who is to be deported . She said: 'I don’t want to embarrass him but if he could stay I want to be with him as long as possible.' Mr Hashimi said his mother, sister . and uncle are living in Pakistan, but that he would be returned to . Afghanistan if his appeal failed.

When I am with them [Tyler and Finlay] it’s like nothing has happened to . me. I don’t remember what has happened in the past.' Mr Hashimi said he planned to become a teacher, but is also a regular at his local cricket club. But Paul Duffy, for the Home Office, told the hearing in London how the decision could not hinge on a 'popularity contest'. He said: 'We’re talking about a very . popular person, he’s a credit to himself and his foster carers. But the . ultimate problem in this context is it’s not a popularity contest. 'Even if the appellant’s family [his mother] is in Pakistan, the appellant is now an adult. He will return to Kabul.' Mr Hashimi is 'beside himself' at the news that he has to move to Kabul, his foster father said today . Pleas from Mr Hashimi's foster family in Kent to let him stay in the UK have fallen on deaf ears at the Home Office .","Najibullah Hashimi, 19, is desperate to stay in the UK with his foster family .

Trial: Darren Ramsey, of east London, was allegedly linked to the crime with a one-in-a-billion DNA match . A party host raped a guest then claimed he must have been sleepwalking during the sex attack, a court heard today. Darren Ramsey, 24, of Poplar, east London, was allegedly linked to the crime with a one-in-a-billion DNA match - but insisted he was unconscious and remembers nothing. He forced himself on a 22-year-old woman who was asleep following a celebration at his one-bedroom flat, the Old Bailey was told. Paul Jarvis, prosecuting, told the central London court: 'Mr Ramsey says he was asleep when he had sex with her and therefore his actions (were) all done when he was effectively unconscious. 'How is it he comes to that conclusion? It seems from the strength of the interviews, because he claims not to remember doing it - therefore he must have been asleep when he did it.' He added: 'While he may deeply regret what he did he cannot escape the simple fact he did it.' Mr Jarvis claimed that Ramsey, who had previously suffered from alcohol-related blackouts, had been able to remove clothing from himself and the woman before raping her. The attack is alleged to have taken place in the early hours of April 14 last year after a party at Ramsey's home. The woman said she believed her drink had been spiked earlier in the evening when she left the living room to go to the toilet. 'Someone had put more Jack Daniel’s in it,' she said. 'It was a lot stronger.' Later, she talked with Ramsey in his bedroom and the two went to sleep fully clothed. She allegedly then woke to find her leggings and underwear around her ankles and Ramsey forcing himself on her. Hearing: The Old Bailey (pictured) in central London was told Ramsey forced himself on a 22-year-old woman who was asleep following a celebration at his one-bedroom flat on April 14 last year . 'I panicked,' she said. 'I was in shock. I just lay still and eventually went back to sleep.' The woman said she told a friend about the attack the next morning on her BlackBerry. A taxi was called for her and she was eventually persuaded to go to the police by her mother a week later. When he was arrested, Ramsey said the last thing he could remember was going to sleep with his arm around the alleged victim. The court heard he told officers: 'That's what people do - they cuddle up when they're in bed.' Ramsey denies a single count of rape. The trial continues.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 09:17 EST, 21 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:59 EST, 21 May 2013 . Taxpayers are picking up the bill for civil servants to hire ball gowns and dinner suits. Whitehall staff have received thousands of pounds through the ‘evening dress allowance’, new figures reveal. It is just the latest revelation about the extra perks and expenses enjoyed by government officials despite three years of austerity. Officials at government departments can claim back the cost of hiring or buying dinner suits or evening dresses to attend official functions . Under official Whitehall rules staff can claim for the cost of hiring evening dress to attend official work functions. And if there are three events in the diary they can ask the taxpayer to help to buy them a suit or a dress. At the Ministry of Defence alone, expense claims for evening dress have reached almost £16,000 since 2008. Vince Cable's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills paid out almost £3,000 from December 2011 and to May 2013. At least five other departments offer the evening dress allowance but could not say how much it cost the taxpayer. Details of the use of public money for civil servants to attend black tie events and dinners were revealed by Tory MP Priti Patel in a series of parliamentary questions. She said: 'British taxpayers will be astounded to . see that they have been footing the bill for new suits and gowns for . civil servants attending fancy events. 'Perhaps this is another public . sector perk to undress ahead of the comprehensive spending review.' Defence minister Andrew Robathan said 80 members of staff have claimed £15,793 on expenses to hire or buy evening dress since 2008, including 14 people in the last year. He added: 'This allowance is for the hire of evening dress by civilian staff for official functions, or for the purchase of it if more than three functions are foreseen, in which case 75 per cent of the cost may be recovered through the allowance. However this is only available once in every 10 years.' Defence minister Andrew Robathan said the MoD has spent £16,000 on its evening dress allowance since 2008. Tory MP Priti Patel unearthed details of the bizarre allowance through parliamentary questions . Treasury minister Sajid Javid confirmed staff in George Osborne's department were able to claim for an evening dress allowance, but could not say how much it has cost the state. He said: ‘This is a taxable benefit and is paid through staff salary; to attempt to extract this information would exceed the disproportionate cost threshold. ‘All staff must refer to the Department’s travel and subsistence policy when making a claim for evening dress allowance and must obtain pre-approval from a director for the expenditure.’ The Home Office, the Department for Education, the Scotland Office and the Department for Transport also said they did not keep separate records for the cost of hiring evening dress. Solicitor General Oliver Heald said it paid £75 for someone to hire full evening dress for an official engagement in July 2008. Matthew . Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'It is . totally unacceptable that a small number of civil servants are billing . taxpayers for thousands of pounds a year to pay for their glad rags. Staff can claim back the cost of hiring a dinner suit, or buy one if they will be attending three official functions . 'The civil servants in question are doubtless being well fed and watered at these official functions at our expense, so making us pay for their clothes as well is beyond a joke. 'This is yet another example of the kind of perk enjoyed by civil servants which would be a non-starter in the private sector.' The Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Cabinet Office, the Department for International Development, the Northern Ireland Office and the Wales Office and the Department of Health said they had not made any payments for officials. A Government spokesman said: 'We are reviewing Civil Service terms and conditions as part of our Civil Service Reform programme. 'The Civil Service will remain a good employer so it can attract and retain high quality staff. 'However some of its conditions have become outliers in comparison to the wider public and private sector and these will be addressed.' Earlier this month it emerged that Whitehall staff are being paid extra bonuses worth thousands of pounds just for doing their job. Extra allowances are given to civil servants for being good at typing, knowing first aid, being green and working late. Critics said the payouts were outdated and must be abolished at a time of austerity. Dozens of staff in government departments and agencies are eligible for the extra cash on top of their salaries. At Eric Pickles' Department for Communities and Local Government, staff can receive £144 for being a fire marshal, £200 as a first aider and £600 in a 'green allowance'. They can also be paid £3,160-a-year for being on call and up to £1,092 for 'typing proficiency'. Spending on the allowances and subsidies last year was £946,600, 23 per cent higher than in 2011-12.","Whitehall staff able to claim expenses for an 'evening dress allowance'

Jonathan Price, 41, posed as a wealthy businessman, weaving a tissue of lies including that he was an ex-SAS man, and that he was a friend of the late, exiled Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky . A conman who duped a string of women into falling for him and handing over more than £170,000 after he met them on a website for 'sugar daddies' was jailed for seven years today. Jonathan Price, 41, posed as a wealthy businessman, weaving a tissue of lies including that he was an ex-SAS man, and that he was a friend of the late, exiled Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky. He also claimed to have a home in the exclusive Sandbanks area, where football boss Harry Redknapp lives. He turned his victims' lives upside down and even married one woman, and fathered her child. With 'extraordinary callousness' the 'Walter Mitty figure' pretended he was dying and invented a friend who would email progress reports to one victim in a bid to convince her, the prosecution said. After convincing them he had millions in offshore accounts, he managed to borrow many thousands from his victims and their ageing parents by claiming he had cash flow problems and that he would repay them once the issues were resolved. But in fact Price was a penniless career criminal who would vanish after claiming to be terminally ill with a brain tumour and move in with another woman, who he had already been developing as a potential victim. He met women online by using a 'sugar daddies' site which aimed to match beautiful women with wealthy men, Teesside Crown Court heard. Price fleeced a florist in her 30s from the Bournemouth after beginning a relationship with her, then moving in with her parents and conning £24,000 out of them for life-prolonging cancer treatments he pretended he needed. He then moved on to prey upon a London-based 38-year-old retail manager. He duped her into letting him use her credit cards and within months she was left bankrupt, with a loss of around £20,000. 'She has lost her flat, she had to declare herself bankrupt and she now lives with her mother,' said Adrian Dent, prosecuting. The court heard while he was with her, Price had started to target a chemist from County Durham to whom he proposed after charming her online. They planned a £96,000 wedding at Rockliffe Hall Hotel near Darlington, then claimed to have high blood pressure in a bid to cover the fact the venue would not honour the booking when no payment was made. Instead they married at Harrogate Register Office in front of just four people. He met women online by using a 'sugar daddies' site which aimed to match beautiful women with wealthy men, Teesside Crown Court (pictured) heard . Though they picked out an expensive engagement ring from Graff’s jewellers in Bond Street which needed altering, no payment was made and she ended up with a totally different ring, probably fake.He defrauded her out of £72,000 and her parents out of a further £7,000. She had his baby last year. They have since divorced. Businesses lost around £50,000 from his offending. He previously pleaded guilty to 14 frauds and one count of theft, and it was said he would plan his next con while in jail for his last. Price, whose latest address was near Darlington, would produce false bank statements to convince the women and their families he had a fortune abroad. That would reassure them he was a safe bet for a short loan. He would then use that money to wine and dine his next victim, convincing them of his super-rich status. He claimed to have a white Rolls Royce, to have been a Paratrooper and even in the SAS, the court heard. His deceptions also included a businessman he tricked into becoming his personal financial manager, an estate agents and a boat dealer. A Leeds garage was tricked into loaning him a car when he placed orders for a £70,000 Audi A8 with extras and a £44,000 A5 for his wife, after showing a sales rep he had made money transfers on a laptop. Peter Sabiston, defending . Price also made a series of offers for exclusive homes including a £5 million property near Harrogate.His name now appears on the waltermittyhunt.com site which claims to publicise people who falsely claim to have been in the services. Mr Dent said: 'The defendant is a serial fraudster and a thief.' His 'deeply ingrained' desire to offend and lack of conscience meant he groomed vulnerable people - typically single women in their 30s, the prosecution said. The latest offences were committed between 2010 and 2012 but his seven previous convictions for dishonesty date back 20 years and he has been jailed four times. The total loss for his victims was £172,533, Mr Dent said. In his act of being seriously ill, Price would shiver, vomit, stutter and claimed to suffer terrible headaches, Mr Dent said. Price, who had a bushy beard and wore dark glasses for the hearing, has not had contact with his parents, who live in Lincolnshire, since 2000. He was arrested in May last year after his 'deeply suspicious' parents-in-law reported him to the police. Peter Sabiston, defending, has told the court previously: 'He is unsure because of the lies he has told, what is true and what is fantasy. He does seem to lead a life of fantasy.' His barrister told the court today he realised he may never see his child again, and accepts he has 'damaged some people very badly and caused a lot of hardship to people he was very close to'. Mr Sabiston added: 'He is a man who does have that Walter Mitty lifestyle and he has used other people’s money to fund it.'","Jonathan Price posed as businessman and friend of the rich and powerful .

Two fraudsters fleeced the Student Loans Company out of £370,000 before spending their cut of the money on expensive holidays and Rolex watches, a court heard. Mustafa Ali, 22, and Daniel Buchanan, 31, were jailed for a total of seven years today after submitting scores of bogus applications for student credit. Ali, the 'architect' of the scam, spent his ill-gotten gains on trips to Dubai, Florida and New York, while he and Buchanan also bought themselves a selection of designer watches. Jailed: Mustafa Ali, 22, (left) and Daniel Buchanana, 31, who were jailed for a total of seven years for submitting the bogus applications for student credit . The pair supplied fake A-level exam certificates for people who didn't have the qualifications they needed to get into university. Once they had been accepted onto courses, Buchanan and Ali took a cut of the new undergraduate's loan for their 'services'. As the pair were jailed at Southwark Crown Court, the judge said that students who had worked hard for their qualifications were denied places on college courses because they had been taken by people who took advantage of the fraud. Ali and Buchanan charged £1,000 a time for fake A-Level certificates but their fees depended on the level of service they offered. They 'kept tabs' on each student, monitoring their accounts to ensure, once the loan was eventually approved, they received a cut for their 'services'. High life: Mustafa Ali, 22, spent his share of the money on a trip to Dubai and other luxury destinations around the world . All expenses paid... with a scam: Ali, 22, also flew to New York with the money he made from his scam . In total, the SLC issued £368,469 worth of loans after 174 requests were made on behalf of 150 people. The pair are believed to have pocketed tens of thousands of pounds as their share of the scam, although the exact amount is unknown. In many cases the applicants withdrew from their courses before applying to other universities to claim another loan with Buchanan and Ali's help. Buchanan, who at the time was studying criminal law and criminology at London Metropolitan University, created false qualifications to get onto his course. He 'recruited' students to take part in the con while Ali, a former business administration student at Southbank University, administered online applications. The scam took place between September 1, 2011, and December 5, 2012, when 79 applications were successfully processed. They were eventually caught after fraud investigators 'eavesdropped' on their phone conversations. In a separate con, Buchanan was part of a gang of criminals who laundered more than £25,000 of fake money through a branch of Barclays Bank in Lewisham, southeast London. Holiday destination: Ali, 22, also went to Florida and bought Rolex watches with the money they made from the Student Loans Company con . Daniel Buchanan boasted that he could get a male friend onto a degree course with fake qualifications in a telephone conversation. He said he got into university himself to study law without passing his A-Levels. Buchanan and Ali created fake A-level certificates, then pocketed a share of the student loan when it was paid out. In the conversation on November 16, 2012, they said: . Male: 'how can I get in without any qualifications?' Buchanan: 'I can sort that out. My brethren . makes it all up innit. He makes up all the qualifications, everything. 'You go, you rumble, you're in, you start studying. Do your modules, . anything. I'm doing it now. I'm doing a degree in law. I've got my . little usb stick.' Male: 'your brethren is going to have to sort me out because I need to get on a course' Buchanan: 'I could get you a degree in English ak, I could get you an English degree.' Male: 'I want electrical engineering.' Buchanan: 'I can get that still.' They took advantage of a quick cash deposit facility, paying in envelopes stuffed with crude banknote-sized pieces of paper, 'book-ended' by £20 notes, on nine occasions in September last year. The gang then withdrew the cash, with Buchanan using part of it to purchase airline tickets. Ali was jailed for four years while Buchanan was handed a total of three years in prison. Sentencing, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said Ali was 'at the very heart' of the scam, describing him as 'the architect' and 'prime mover'. Buchanan 'enthusiastically' joined the plot when it was already in existence, the judge said. 'This was an extremely serious fraud not only because it caused the Student Loans Company to pay out £368,000 which it should not have, but in the making of false applications for student loans, supported by false exam certificates, it undermined the whole college entrance system. 'Some students who wanted to go to college and had the necessary qualifications would have been prevented from doing so because those places were taken by people who had fraudulently taken advantage of the services you two were offering. 'In offering those services, you were encouraging others to act in a criminal way which may well bring some of them before the courts. 'This was a highly sophisticated scheme which was fraudulent from the outset and extremely profitable, and it would have continued to be so, if the police had not intervened.' Buchanan was also ordered to pay back . just £8,447.42 gained from the SLC con and the money laundering, within . six months, or face a further six months in jail. A confiscation hearing . for Ali will take place at a later date. Buchanan and Ali acted as 'service providers' in the SLC scam, said prosecutor Timothy Cray. Detectives today released a damning text exchange between Ali and a potential client in which he boasted he could create fake A-level certificates to get someone into university. Client: 'I got some of mi mates that wanna do dis uni ting dis year can u help them out' Ali: 'yh how old are they' Client: '21, 22 nd that' 'How much is it nd how quick can u do it' Ali: 'Yh I can get then a levels to get into Uni each yeh' 'Gonna cost dem 600 each' 'And they will be able to get into Uni' Client: 'Any uni yhh' 'Nd I get a cut yh ??' Ali: 'Yh don't worry il sort u out just . line them up for me' 'Normally I charge them 1000 when ther loan comes' 'But tell then pay 600 cash and il give there things' 'And when der loan . comes they gotta pay 400' 'Their service included the provision of false exam certificates, submission of applications and monitoring of online accounts that were opened. 'In return, they received payment from successful applicants.' 'Mustafa Ali was the administrator of the fraud with responsibility for online activity. 'The crown's case is he was the prime mover in the fraud. Daniel Buchanan was the recruiter. They got the cash from the people who had collected their own loans.' The SLC system depends on 'trust', Mr Cray added. 'There is no stipulation as to what the money can be used for and the loan company do not check how it is spent.' Naeem Main, defending Buchanan, a married father-of-two, insisted his actions were not out of 'mere greed'. 'He is not somebody who has had the advantages afforded to many of us.

'He is someone who has taken his responsibilities towards his family extremely seriously and that's what drove him to commit these offences.' Emma Phillips, for Ali, described him as 'naive and immature'. Ali, of Shadwell, east London, admitted conspiracy to defraud while Buchanan, of Tottenham, north London pleaded guilty to the same charge and converting criminal property. Richard Walton, Commander of the Counter Terrorism Command, said: 'This was a major student loan scam. Buchanan and Ali criminally exploited the student loan system; legitimate students across the country will be thankful for these convictions.' The case was handled by the National Terrorist Financial Investigation Unit because of their specialist expertise. There was no link to terrorism. Heather Laing, Fraud Prevention and Detection Manager at SLC said: 'This case and the sentence they have received has sent a very clear message that the courts take fraud against the taxpayer very seriously. 'We worked closely with the Metropolitan Police, using the analytical tools we have in place to help identify individuals and gather evidence, helping to piece together the wider criminal activity that SLC and the police had identified. 'At SLC, we have a robust system of checks and safeguards in place for the administration of student finance and applicants cannot obtain funding without providing the relevant evidence to prove their eligibility. In addition, students must also have their attendance and registration confirmed by their place of study before any loan or tuition fee payments are paid out.'","Mustafa Ali, 22, and Daniel Buchanan, 31, supplied fake A-level certificates .

A teenager predicted to fail her English A-level was allowed to type her exam answers because of her poor handwriting – and scored the top mark in the country. Frederica Drewer, 18, who suffers from dyspraxia, had been tipped for a D in English, but exceeded all expectations in her final exam and is now expected to be awarded an A*. Dyspraxia, also called Clumsy Child Syndrome and Developmental Co-ordination Disorder, is a lifelong neurological condition which can cause problems with language, perception and movement. Exam joy: Frederica Drewer, 18, with a letter from the exam board after she scored 99.5 per cent on her A-Level English paper . Poor handwriting is one of the most . common symptoms, but people with the condition sometimes also have . difficulty with routine tasks such as driving and household chores. Frederica, who is known as Freddie and . lives with her mother Rebecca, a maths teacher, and father Joe, a . mortgage adviser, was diagnosed last year after her English teacher at . Ashton Park School noticed she was struggling. Top marks: Frederica, who has dyspraxia, was allowed to use her laptop in the exam in January . Tony Lansdowne raised concerns about her losing valuable marks for her messy handwriting. And armed with a laptop, his student . went on to score the top mark in the country for her final exam on . Arthur Miller’s play, The Crucible. She said: ‘I have always had real problems with my spelling and  punctuation and my handwriting is particularly sloppy. ‘Being diagnosed and being able to use . a laptop has made things a  thousand times easier. 'All my teachers have . commented about the huge  difference it has made.’ Freddie says she struggles with . organisation and spacial issues and found it difficult to keep track of . what she was writing in handwritten exam scripts. She sat the paper in January and was given a mark of 99.5 per cent – the highest in the country. Exam board AQA has asked if it can use her paper as an example to students nationwide. The exam module paper makes up part of her overall English A-level exam and her predicted D has been changed to an A*. The teenager from Bristol said: ‘I was . shocked when I picked up the results. 'I went in to school feeling quite . down and I couldn’t believe it when I saw the 99.5 per cent. I was . expecting to have to re-sit, but when I saw my result I was blown away.’ Top marks: Frederica Drewer, 18, is studying for her A-levels at Ashton Park School in Bristol . Mrs Drewer said: ‘People with . dyspraxia have organisational issues and handwriting issues. Her English . teacher noticed she was making  mistakes which fitted the profile.’ She added: ‘The diagnosis means she . can now use a laptop to type up her exams rather than handwriting. The . dyspraxia went undiagnosed for a long time.’ The sixth form student, who is also taking philosophy and psychology, hopes to study philosophy at university after a gap year. Dyspraxia is a condition that affects movement and coordination during childhood. Youngsters who have the condition are often labelled as 'clumsy' and sometimes have problems with language and thought. It is not known exactly what causes it, although it is believed to be a disruption in the way messages from the brain are transmitted to the body. The condition used to be called 'clumsy child syndrome'. Children with dyspraxia sometimes additionally have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia or suffer from Autism. The condition often goes diagnosed, but up to one in 12 children could suffer from it. There is no cure for dyspraxia, although therapy often helps children with their problems. Having dyspraxia does not affect intelligence, although children with the condition may need extra help as they might find learning more challenging.

A brave bride who lost both her legs and one arm to an infection has made a miraculous recovery to walk down the aisle and marry her long term love. Debbie Bury, 44, was struck down with a rare form of pneumonia last year and was forced to call off the wedding to partner Bob Bury, 63. Debbie, from Gilberdyke, East Yorks, managed to pull through, despite falling into a coma - but doctors were forced to amputate both her legs, and part of her right hand. Debbie Grant was able to walk down the aisle to marry Bob Bury despite having had both legs amputated after contracting a rare form of pneumonia . Debbie decided to postpone the nuptials, and, determined to walk down the aisle, began learning to walk again on prosthetic legs. Twelve months on, inspirational Debbie finally said 'I do' in front of hundreds of her friends and family after proving doctors wrong and fighting to tie the knot. Debbie said: 'It's been a marvellous day, very tiring, but worth it. 'I was a bit nervous, but because people were all be looking at me, not because I thought I'd fall. 'There were times when I thought I wouldn't be able to walk down the aisle, but I had a test run and that went okay. 'I'm so excited to be marrying Bob - I've waited long enough for it.' Debbie clutched her partner's hand after exchanging rings and family and friends applauded as she was led out of the church. Bob was dressed in his Merchant Navy uniform, while his bride wore a white dress with a long train, which she was able to wear despite having had the fitting for the dress before falling ill and losing her legs. The rare form of the lung condition meant Debbie spent 6 weeks in a coma, and doctors were forced to amputate both of her lower legs as well as her fingers and half the palm of her right hand . Bob said: 'Debbie looked beautiful and she's a very happy girl. It was about time we finally got married.' Reverend Rob Taylor, who led the wedding ceremony, said he felt proud to marry the couple. Revered Taylor said: 'Every wedding is a joyous occasion but when there are special circumstances like this, it's all the more memorable. It was a real delight.' The couple were taken by horse and carriage to the Lowther Hotel, in Goole, for their wedding reception and they are planning a honeymoon later this year. Family member Gareth Davies, 45, walked Debbie down the aisle and she wore dainty shoes attached to her prosthetic limbs. Debbie was determined to walk down the aisle and was able to wear her original wedding dress on the big day, despite having had it fitted before she lost her legs . Gareth said: 'We're all really proud of her, it's amazing how she's overcome everything. 'This is a day we never thought would come after she fell ill.' Bridesmaids at the were Gareth's wife Nicola, Debbie's stepdaughter and sister Claire Bury, who wore red gowns. Nicola, 38, said: 'It was a bit strange to see my dad get married but it's been a very emotional day and it's a real milestone for the pair of them. 'I think Debbie was quite overcome by it all afterwards.' Best man, Paul Holland, 30, Bob's grandson, said: 'It's been a nice ceremony and it's about time they had some good luck. 'This is the happy ending they both deserve.' Pneumonia is inflammation of the tissue in one or both of your lungs. It is usually caused by an infection.At the end of the breathing tubes in your lungs are clusters of tiny air sacs. If you have pneumonia, these tiny sacs become inflamed and fill up with fluid. The most common cause of pneumonia is a pneumococcal infection caused by bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, there are many different types of bacteria and viruses that can lead to pneumonia. The symptoms of pneumonia can develop suddenly (over 24-48 hours) or may come on more slowly, over several days. Pneumonia symptoms vary and can be similar to those of other chest infections, such as acute bronchitis. You are likely to have a cough. This can be dry, or may produce phlegm (thick mucus) that is yellow, green, brownish or blood-stained. Most people recover well with antibiotics and rest, but the elderly and those with a weakened immune system may be at increased risk . If you experience any symptoms of pneumonia, see your GP for diagnosis. Learn more about Pneunomia here . Debbie, who insisted she had waited 'long enough' to marry Bob, had a wedding dress fitting the day before she became ill. She went into a six-week coma last year before undergoing several surgeries. Debbie said: 'I woke up in the night feeling ill, and I went straight to the doctor the next day. 'They said I had contracted a viral infection and that I had a serious form of pneumonia. 'That is all I remember until I woke up a month later.' Debbie was rushed from Hull Royal Infirmary, where her initial diagnosis was given, to Glenfield Hospital near Leicester, which has a special unit for dealing with viral infections. While Debbie was transferred, relatives frantically tried to contact her fiancee, who was working in the merchant navy in Brazil. He was able to fly back to the UK and arrived in Leicester two days after Debbie was admitted. Bob said: 'They said it was one of the worst cases they had seen.' As the cocktail of medicines and Debbie's body fought to keep her vital organs going, her limbs started to die. Bob said: 'We started talking about funeral arrangements at the hospital, the doctors advised me to start making them. 'I thought I would be travelling back to cancel our wedding and book a funeral. 'But that week, she started improving.' Debbie had begun to feel tired and was coughing on the evening of Sunday, March 11, last year. She was taken by ambulance to Hull Royal Infirmary and then Leicester the following day. Bob arrived at Glenfield Hospital on Wednesday, March 14. Bob said: 'When she was in the coma I would keep talking to her. 'I'd just tell her about everyday things like what was going on and who would be visiting her that day. 'When I spoke to her, her eyes would flutter like she was trying to open them, so the nurses said keep doing it.' In April, Debbie was transferred back to Hull Royal Infirmary and she started to come round. She said: 'When I woke up I couldn't even move my head and I had a bed sore, which had worn through to my skull because I had been on the bed such a long time. 'It was very scary when I woke up, I didn't know what was happening.' At first, doctors thought they would be able to save Debbie's legs near her ankles, but when surgery began they realised they would have to remove most of her calves, almost to her knees. Her fingers and half of her palm was amputated on her right hand. She also had to have her little finger on her left hand removed. Debbie was allowed home on July 13, last year and in August she was fitted with her first pair of new prosthetic legs. Debbie said: 'As the swelling keeps decreasing, I will need different legs in future. 'I don't know whether I'll be able to have a bionic hand, but I've told them I don't just want a plastic thing that is for show. I'd rather just have nothing if it isn't going to have a function.'","Debbie Bury 44, was planning her wedding to Bob Bury, 63 when she fell ill .

These thrill-seeking pensioners claim to have found the secret to staying young in their golden years. While many senior citizens choose to while away their down-time with the odd round of golf or potter in the garden, adrenaline junkies Dennis and Sylvia Bloor, from Cornwall, have splashed out £60,000 on riding stomach-churning rollercoasters at theme parks around the globe. Mr Bloor, 74, and his wife, 64, have braved more than 250 rollercoasters across Europe and the U.S - as well as almost 4,000 trips on the Nemesis ride at Alton Towers - and insist their hobby keeps them looking and feeling youthful. Not your average retirement: Sylvia and Dennis Bloor have chosen to spend their golden years riding rollercoasters rather than playing golf or bridge . Thrills and spills: Pensioners Sylvia and Dennis Bloor have ridden more than 250 rollercoasters in more than 40 theme parks across Europe and the U.S. The Bloors are the oldest members of the Rollercoaster Club of Great Britain (RCCGB), which they joined nearly 20 years ago after becoming hooked on thrill rides. Mrs Bloor, who has arthritis, claims the adrenaline boost she gets from a trip on a rollercoaster is 'like having a cortisone injection'. 'Everybody's always telling us we look so youthful, I tell them it's all the screaming we do,' she said. 'It's all about the adrenaline, the fun and the anticipation. I've got arthritis and it's like having a cortisone injection.' The Bloors have spent more than 1,000 days in over 40 theme parks across the globe since Sylvia first persuaded her 'reluctant' husband to take a trip to Alton Towers in 1994. Extreme OAPs: Thrill-seeking pensioners Dennis Bloor, 74, and his wife Sylvia, 64, love nothing more than a rollercoaster ride . International pastime: The Bloors strap themselves in for another stomach-churning drop at Dorney Park in Pennsylvania, U.S. She said: 'I liked roller coasters but I never went on them much and Dennis had been on one or two tame versions in his time. 'We only lived 15 miles from Alton Towers and were planning on moving to Cornwall so we wanted to cover all of the tourist attractions that we could before leaving the area. 'I said we ought to go and although he wasn't keen, Dennis reluctantly agreed. 'I got him on a runaway mine train and all I could hear was him screaming ""woo-hoo"",' Mrs Bloor said. After that, the couple were hooked. 'I thought they were for kids - but it turns out they are for big kids too,' Mr Bloor said, before adding: 'The rest is history really, we love it.' As members of the RCCGB, the couple, from Tregurrian in Cornwall, go on regular trips to theme parks around the world. Unique hobby: The Bloors, seen at Alton Towers, have spent around £60,000 on riding rollercoasters around the world . Their membership entitles them to exclusive access on rides, including late-night sessions without the general public. They are also given premier access to new rides before they are officially opened. Dennis, a former BT Telephone Exchange engineer, said: 'It's brilliant to be able to experience the rides in a completely different way to how the public would. 'The ride operators know that we all love speed, so they will alter the brakes to make us go faster. 'It's a completely different way of riding rollercoasters,' he said. Every year the Bloors travel across the Atlantic for a three-week theme park extravaganza, visiting theme parks from New York to Chicago to San Francisco. The couple's favourite steel roller coaster is the Top Thrill Dragster ride at Cedar Point Theme Park in Ohio, US, while the Voyage roller coaster at Holiday World in Santa Claus, Indiana is the top wooden ride according to the Bloors. They are very popular among theme park staff right across the world, as their age sets them apart from the other 1,500 members of the RCCGB. 'We buy the ride operators little gifts and they will give us special allowances when we go to any of the parks without our group,' Mrs Bloor said. 'We have known them for such a long time and it's nice to see a familiar face when you travel around the world to all these fantastic parks.' 'We just love riding roller coasters - they're wonderful. We like to go as fast as possible,' said Mrs Bloor, a former BT Telephone Exchange supervisor, who insisted the couple never get bored of their hobby. All aboard: The Bloors (centre) get set for another round of thrills and spills on a trip to Pacific Park in Canada last year . Adrenaline junkies: The couple (on the right) take a trip aboard a rollercoaster ride at Busch Gardens in Florida in 2009 . 'It's never the same experience and every ride is different. 'You're . always sitting in a different seat where you will get a different level . of G-Force, and the weather conditions will never be the same. 'It's always completely thrilling.' 'Completely thrilling': The Bloors take time out to enjoy a less nerve-wracking ride at the Six Flags theme park in New York in 2001 . Long-time hobby: Mr Bloor is seen on a ride at Camden Park in West Virginia back in 1998, not long after the couple first fell for rollercoaster rides . The fearless pensioners say they will try any rollercoaster, no matter how fast the ride or how steep the drop. But the pair do draw the line at water rides. 'Neither of us are a fan of water, and who wants to get drenched and feel cold all day,' Mr Bloor said. 'Give us a good roller coaster any day - we love them and they keep us young, it's a winning combination.'","Dennis Bloor, 74, and wife Sylvia, 64, claim their hobby keeps them young .

Thousands of hospital beds are set to be scrapped under secret plans drawn up by NHS managers. Doctors warn the loss of so many beds will put patients at risk in an NHS that is already ‘overwhelmed’. Cutbacks: The number of hospital beds could be cut by up to 25 per cent in some areas (stock image) The proposals, tucked away in documents published by Trusts planning to close or downgrade A&E departments, reveal: . The plan suggests that GPs and other services will play a bigger role in providing care in the community . The disclosures come just days after . the publication of a report warning that hospitals are ‘full to . bursting’, with Government figures showing that 94 per cent of beds were . occupied last month – more than the recommended maximum of 85 per cent . to ensure patient safety. Campaigners . argue the proposed cuts are being ‘smuggled through without proper . debate’. Dr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal  College of GPs, said: . ‘I’m shocked. The NHS is heaving. We don’t have enough beds. We’ll be . looking after sicker and sicker people in the community, with nowhere to . put them. ‘We can’t cope. Community services are stretched beyond belief. Patients will suffer in the end. We could end up with beds in corridors all over again.’ A report for NHS North West London, which was leaked to The Mail on Sunday, assesses proposals to close four out of the area’s nine casualty units. The opening page of the report, which was written by independent public-health specialist Dr David McCoy, warns that its contents should not be ‘quoted or disseminated’ and are strictly for ‘limited circulation’. The report says the closures involve ‘a significant shift of health care activity and expenditure’, to be achieved by closing A&E wards and ‘a reduction in the number of hospital beds’. Dr McCoy writes: ‘A potentially more serious issue than the closure of A&Es is the reduction in number of hospital beds by nearly 25 per cent .  .  . However, details of the clinical rationale and modelling used to arrive at the proposal are absent.’ He adds that ‘any shortcoming in the plans to compensate for this by strengthening and improving out-of-hospital care will have serious consequences for patients and families’. None of the hundreds of bed closures in North-West London – mostly acute beds along with 20 paediatric and maternity – are explicitly mentioned in a 78-page consultation document supplied to local residents. 'Putting lives at risk': Campaigners argue hospitals are currently operating at full capacity and community services are already at breaking point . Dr John Lister, director of campaign . group London Health Emergency, described the plans as ‘shockingly . irresponsible’. He said: ‘This is being smuggled through without proper . debate. The consultation document told local people and health . professionals only part of the story, and kept key details tucked away . in obscure documents. We urge a reopening of consultation and a proper . debate with all the facts on the table.’ In . South-East London, a special administrator appointed by the Government . to oversee changes at South London Healthcare NHS Trust, which is close . to bankruptcy, has highlighted the need to close hundreds of beds. The information is on page 54 of Appendix K of the administrator’s draft report and reveals there should be 618 bed closures by 2017 – 15 per cent of the current total. This includes 173 at Lewisham Hospital and 224 at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust. However, a spokeswoman for Guy’s and St Thomas’ denied there were any plans to close beds. Documents from a consultation in Trafford, Greater Manchester, show similar plans. The ‘pre-consultation business case’ says: ‘Hospital beds required by the population of Trafford are reduced and those beds are replaced by the extended supported care in the community.’ At Barts Health NHS Trust in East London, bed numbers are forecast to drop by 21 per cent by 2016-17. Elsewhere in the Trust, Newham University Hospital will lose 72 beds and Whipps Cross University Hospital 138. Karen Reissman, a nurse and Unison representative from  Bolton, said plans to reorganise health services in Manchester would also include bed losses, despite the public consultation  literature failing to explicitly mention such changes. She said: ‘They’re saying 25 per cent of  people in hospital do not need to be treated in hospital. It’s all about affordability, and it’s shocking.’ Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘This reveals the full extent of the risks being taken with patient care. Hospitals are sailing dangerously close to the wind. Ministers must take urgent action to ensure patient safety.’ Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘Changes should happen with patients, not simply to patients. The Government’s decision to drive through £20 billion of NHS savings is having a real impact on care. They need to rethink.’ A spokesman for NHS North West London denied the figures had been ‘hidden’, adding: ‘The figures are all given in the document and explained in detail in the appendix. We have published all these  figures on beds in 73,000 distributed copies of our consultation plan – to which we received over 17,000 responses. Modern health care means people can be better supported at home.’ A spokesman for the Health for North East London consultation, representing King George Hospital, said the bed losses could be revised lower but ‘significant reductions’ were planned. He said: ‘These relate to efficiency gains. They are not a consequence of the A&E changes. The Trust needs to bring itself back into financial balance and in line with national benchmarking around length of stay.’","Some areas could see the number of hospital beds cut by 25 per cent .
The plans suggest GPs playing a larger role providing care in the community .
The number of patients treated in hospital will be restricted, with care increasingly provided by GPs or other services in the community.
In North-West London, almost 800 beds – one in four – could be lost across nine hospitals.
King George Hospital in Ilford, Essex, could see its capacity cut from 387 beds to just 47 in a few years.
In South-East London, 618 beds are to be scrapped across seven hospitals over the next five years.
There are also plans to slash beds in other parts of London and Manchester, but the scale of these cuts is yet to be revealed. There are likely to be similar reductions in bed numbers across the UK."

Children as young as five have told how a pensioner brandishing a sawn-off shot gun walked into their kindergarten before shooting himself dead in front of them. The horrifying scene played out at the St Pierre La Rochefoucauld School, in one of the most upmarket areas of Paris close to the Eiffel Tower. ‘The man was killed with a gun,’ said one five-year-old witness. ‘He fell on the ground, there was lots of blood everywhere. I thought it was a terrorist.’ Parents arrive to get their children as policemen stand guard at the entrance of the nursery school . Others spoke about the man, who was in his 60s and lived locally, handing out notes related to a tax evasion scandal involving France’s Socialist government. All of those who witnessed the carnage were being treated by psychiatrists specialising in sudden trauma. A mother of one of the children involved said: ‘Apparently he’s a madman whom they tried to stop. He reacted by shooting himself.’ The so far unidentified man is said to have entered the school at around 11.30am, ‘without any problems at all’, said a police source.

Around a dozen pupils at the school and one teacher are thought to have witnessed the horror. ‘We think he used a single gun – there was a loud blast,’ said a neighbour living in the upmarket 7th arrondissement on Paris’s Left Bank, where the school has been situated since the 18th Century. Police who attended the scene said the man was was thought to be suffering from psychological problems. The kindergarten is an exclusive Roman Catholic one favoured by wealthy families living in the area, which is close to the French Parliament and numerous government departments. Another neighbour told Europe 1 radio: ‘There are firefighters, police, especially police, and security everywhere.

There are people around who said the noise was like a bomb.’ The man is said to have been distributing bits of paper with the names ‘Cahuzac’ and ‘Montgolfier’ scribbled on them. Jerome Cahuzac is the disgraced Socialist budget minister who is facing prison for laundering hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of cash through Switzerland so as to avoid paying tax. Eric de Mongolfier is France’s Attorney General, and the man tasked with investigating such incidents of corruption. The shooting prompted Vincent Peillon, France’s education minister, to return to Paris from Brussels as a ‘matter of emergency’, said a spokesman for his ministry.

The friend of murdered Stephen Lawrence, who managed to escape a gang of youths after they stabbed the A Level pupil, says that the hunt for the killers should be dropped. Duwayne Brooks, 38, who fled after a gang of racist thugs began attacking him and Stephen, says that it is time for police to abandon their search for the three other killers after two of the yobs were jailed for life last year. On Monday it will be twenty years since the pair were attacked by five teenagers and Stephen was fatally stabbed. After a huge police operation, that involved officers bugging properties, two of the gang - Gary Dobson and David Norris - were finally found guilty last year and imprisoned, . The Liberal Democrat councillor for Lewisham says that money should instead be channelled into other murder cases. He says it is time for the numerous investigations and inquiries to end. He said: 'If you let your emotions lead you don't want the police to stop looking, you want them to spend as much money as possible. 'But if you take the emotions out of it, you think about the amount of murder cases which have happened and the amount of money which has been spent on the Lawrence case that hasn’t gone into many of those other murders, which might have solved some of those,' The Sun reported. The 19-year saga involved a string of failed police inquiries, and is estimated to have cost up to £50million . The killing led to Operation Fishpool that, over nearly two decades, would involve 16 arrests, 1,378 statements and 835 house calls. The 19-year saga included a series of failed police inquiries and is estimated to have cost up to £50million. The four-year-long forensic review which prompted the new murder trial cost £3.8million. The unprecedented, anti-terror style bugging operation on the five prime suspects was made necessary because of the bungled initial police response to Stephen's murder. His thoughts may conflict with those of Stephen's mother, Doreen, who has tirelessly campaigned for justice on behalf of her son. Stephen Lawrence's mother Doreen speaks to the media alongside Stephen's father Neville and brother Stuart (left) outside the Old Bailey in central London, following the conviction of Gary Dobson, 36, and David Norris for the murder of her son . It remains a continuing source of pain . for her that three other men — arrested with Dobson and Norris back in 1993 — . are not facing trial, as there is no new forensic evidence linking them . to Stephen. Doreen says she feels anger rather than . hatred towards the men, who, consumed with racial loathing, killed her . son in an unprovoked attack which lasted, the court heard, barely ten . seconds. The 60-year-old’s reputation for being a tough campaigner has won her places on various boards advising government policy makers and senior police officers on race relations. However, regardless of the laws now in place promoting racial equality, she believes racism still exists. Awarded an OBE in 2003 in recognition of her work, Doreen says she will continue fighting to give young men like Stephen all the opportunities he was denied. She regards as her proudest achievement the setting up of the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, which provides bursaries for youngsters from ethnic minorities to pursue their educational ambitions.","Duwayne Brooks says money should be spent solving other murder cases .

The former Radio 1 star, who has two young boys, also disapproved of mothers who dress siblings in the same outfits and said that people were too quick to judge women on breastfeeding and Caesarean sections. She voiced her opinions on Radio 5 Live's series on pregnancy and birth that is presented by her former Radio 1 co-host Colin Murray. Edith Bowman, left, isn't a fan of dressing children in designer labels, unlike Victoria Beckham who frequently dresses daughter Harper in expensive brands . When asked by Murray: 'Do you dress your kids in designer clothes? I hate that', Bowman, 39, replied: 'Agreed. Also, dressing siblings in the same clothes. Let them have their own identity.' She added: 'When I think of designer clothes, though, I think of those really awful 'almost adult' clothes for kids, like suit jackets and leopard-print head bands.' When Murray recalled seeing a toddler in Armani shoes, she replied: 'Ridiculous. It's nice to treat yourself now and again, but you have to remember they'll grow out of them so quickly. 'My brother is about to have a baby girl and my mum and I went to have a look at a shop in north London that does sell the most gorgeous, but expensive, kids' clothes. Mum looked at this amazing little dress for a baby girl - it was £300! It would probably fit her for a month.' Promoting individuality: The DJ is a mother-of-two but won't be dressing her two sons in the same clothes . Bowman, 39, has two sons, Rudy, four, and three-month-old Spike, with Editors frontman Tom Smith. She recently criticised people for being too quick to judge mothers. 'It amazes me how sometimes people can be so thoughtless when they come to give you their opinion, especially around Caesarean sections and breastfeeding,' she told the Radio Times. 'I had no choice in having two C-sections and I can't believe the lack of understanding of people who assume I have not 'put the work in' or don't have the same connection with my child that I would have had if I'd had natural birth.' 'Most natural thing in the world': Edith said she's a big believer in breastfeeding in public (posed by model) Bowman, who hosts a show on BBC Radio 6 Music, added: 'I am a big believer in breast-feeding in public. It's the most natural thing in the world, and it's not as if I just walk about with my boobies hanging out. You can get some amazing contraptions that help you be as discreet as possible.' She added: 'You do get some people where you can feel their uncomfortableness or disapproval - weirdly, it's mostly women, and that's a real shame. But I'm sure there is a level of intrigue there, for sure.'","DJ hits out at expensive outfits for babies .

Groundwater found bubbling up from nearly two miles beneath the surface of Canada may predate the emergence of multicellular life, researchers announced today. A joint British and Canadian team discovered the ancient pockets of water, which they say are like 'trapped time capsules' cut off from the surface for as long as three billion years. It could be some of the oldest water on the planet and may even contain life, the researchers claim, as it contains an abundance of chemicals known to support organisms in the absence of sunlight. Billion year old sparkling water: Showing collection of ancient water and gas in a mine nearly two miles beneath the surface of Ontario, Canada, that may be almost half as old as the Earth itself . More exciting still, the similarity between the rocks that trapped it and those on Mars raises the hope that comparable life sustaining water could be locked deep beneath the surface of the Red Planet. Researchers from the universities of Manchester, Lancaster, Toronto and McMaster analysed the water which poured out of boreholes in a mine 7,875ft beneath Ontario, Canada. 'These are like trapped time capsules,' said Barbra Sherwood Lollar, a geochemist at the University of Toronto. 'They may tell us about the atmosphere 2.7 billion years ago, and about the fluids that formed the valuable ore deposits that are the foundation of Canada’s mineral wealth.' Geochemical reactions with the rocks means the water contains dissolved hydrogen and methane, as well as noble gases like helium, neon, argon and xenon, that have been trapped since early in Earth’s history. These gases could provide energy for microbes that may not have been exposed to the sun for billions of years, the researchers say. Project leader Chris Ballentine, of the University of Manchester, said: 'Our finding is of huge interest to researchers who want to understand how microbes evolve in isolation, and is central to the whole question of the origin of life, the sustainability of life, and life in extreme environments and on other planets.' Using ground-breaking techniques developed at the University of Manchester, the researchers say they have shown that the fluid is at least 1.5 billion years old, but could be significantly older. It could even date back to the formation of the crystalline rocks surrounding the water, which are thought to be around 2.7billion years old - about half as old as the planet Earth itself. Before this finding, the only water of this age was found trapped in tiny bubbles of rock, but the water found in the Canadian mine on the other hand pours from the rock at a rate of nearly two litres per minute. It has similar characteristics to far younger water flowing from a mine 1.7 miles below ground in South Africa that was previously found to support microbes. Buried life? Gas that bubbles out of the floor in the deep mine has a chemical composition that could provide the food source for microbes living in the deep ancient fluids totally in the absence of sunlight . Dr Greg Holland of Lancaster University said: 'Our Canadian colleagues are trying to find out if the water contains life right now. 'What we can be sure of is that we have identified a way in which planets can create and preserve an environment friendly to microbial life for billions of years.' Large regions of Mars are made up of terrain like that of the Earth’s Precambrian Shield – billions of years-old rocks with similar mineralogy. Professor Sherwood Lollar said: 'The ancient waters of the Canadian Shield contain abundant chemicals that we know microbes can use as energy in the absence of sunlight-driven photosynthesis. 'This shows that ancient rocks have the potential to support life and this could be the case whether they are three kilometres below the Earth’s surface or below the surface of Mars.' The Canadian Shield discovery pushes the age of water much farther back than the South Africa discovery, identifying a groundwater system isolated from the surface for billions, rather than tens of millions of years. 'Our discovery establishes that ancient fluids, hitherto thought to have survived only in microscopic fluid inclusions trapped in the rocks, may instead still flow from ancient fractures,' said Professor Sherwood Lollar. Professor Ballentine, who is based in Manchester’s School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, added: 'While the questions about life on Mars raised by our work are incredibly exciting, the ground-breaking techniques we have developed at Manchester to date ancient waters also provide a way to calculate how fast methane gas is produced in ancient rock systems globally. 'The same new techniques can be applied to characterise old, deep groundwater that may be a safe place to inject carbon dioxide.' David Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science, sais: 'This is excellent pioneering research. It gives new insight into our planet. 'It has also developed new technology for carbon capture and storage projects. These have the potential for growth, job creation and our environment.' The findings were published today in the journal Nature.","Ancient pockets of water are like 'trapped time capsules' cut off from the surface for nearly three billion years, researchers say .

When she was at the peak of her powers, the last place you would have expected to find Margaret Thatcher was in a luxury suite in a five-star hotel enjoying a well-earned rest. The former prime minister famously survived on only four hours sleep a night when she was in Downing Street and was deeply reluctant even to go on holiday. But since she was discharged from hospital last week, after minor surgery to remove a growth from her bladder, Lady Thatcher, 87, has been quietly convalescing in a suite at The Ritz hotel in central London. The Iron Lady is now increasingly frail and uncertain on her feet so there were fears she would not be able to manage the stairs at her elegant four-storey Belgravia home. The Ritz has always been one of her favourite places and she has been invited to stay there for the forseeable future. Staff have done their best to make it home from home and her two carers are taking it in turns to stay with her. Britain’s first and only woman prime minister, who won three consecutive general elections, has been in fragile health since she suffered a series of minor strokes more than a decade ago. She suffers acute short-term memory loss. A close friend of Lady Thatcher said: ‘The operation was a complete success but it was physically very draining. It is much easier for Lady Thatcher to recuperate and convalesce at the hotel. ‘Lady Thatcher doesn’t like a fuss being made of her but she is being pampered by all the staff. She went there straight from the hospital and no decision has been taken on how long she will stay there for.’ Lady Thatcher, who was admitted to hospital five days before Christmas, underwent ‘minimally invasive’ surgery. She had been due to spend Christmas Day with her niece, Jane Mayes, who lives in north-east London. Mrs Mayes is the only daughter of her older sister, Muriel, who died aged 83 in 2004. Friends: Former Government spokesman Sir Bernard Ingham, left, and former Scottish Secretary Lord Forsyth, right, will be among Lady Thatcher's visitors . The previous year she had Christmas lunch with Mrs Mayes and her family because Lady Thatcher’s children, Sir Mark and Carol, were both abroad. A small group of friends will take it in turns to visit Lady Thatcher at the hotel. They include Tory MP Conor Burns, former Scottish Secretary Lord Forsyth, Lord Powell, who was her foreign policy adviser at Downing Street, Sir Bernard Ingham who was her press secretary, and Dame Sue Tinson, who was a senior editor at ITN. Cynthia Crawford, nicknamed Crawfie, who was Lady Thatcher’s personal assistant in the Downing Street years, will also visit. Another of her regular visitors is Alison Wakeham, whose husband John, the former Cabinet minister, was badly injured in the IRA bomb which killed his first wife Roberta at the Grand Hotel in Brighton in 1984. Luxury: Staff at The Ritz are 'pampering' Lady Thatcher . Sir Bernard Ingham said: ‘I find her better now than I have seen her in the last few years. ‘She always takes a lively interest in our conversation. She always wants to join in. Sometimes she starts to speak and then the thought deserts her. But she can be very animated. She is one of the greats.’ Lord Parkinson, who was chairman of the Tory Party, also makes a point of keeping in touch. Shortly before Christmas, Lady Thatcher, accompanied by her carer Kate, had Sunday afternoon tea with Lord Parkinson and his wife Ann at their Hertfordshire home. Lord Parkinson said: ‘Margaret looked wonderful and was in sparkling form. We had a lovely afternoon together.’","Former Prime Minister had an operation to remove a growth on her bladder .

A day earlier they were seen chatting with friends at picnic tables while snacking on Kauai's famous Bubba burgers and smoothies. The couple, who are notoriously down-to-earth, sported casual wear and Mark wore his now-famous sandals, which are parodied by Jesse Eisenberg in the film about Facebook, The Social Network.

Fallen star: A dishevelled Culkin, pictured near his New York home earlier this year . On a hot night in June, Macaulay Culkin is DJ-ing at Le Poisson Rouge, a nightclub with arty pretensions in Greenwich Village, New York. Culkin - famous at ten, a millionaire at 12 and a has-been at 15 - lives not far away in a magnificent £2 million loft apartment and can be found at Le Poisson Rouge once a month plying what passes for his trade these days. On this night, there are absences to visit a back room, and when Culkin and his coterie of friends return, they smell of marijuana. People who know him say he’s worlds away from the character of Kevin McCallister, the joyful young boy in Home Alone who charmed millions of movie-goers. Today, skinny to the point of skeletal, Culkin looks far older than his 31 years. His alabaster skin appears papery and his green eyes framed with blonde lashes add to the air of vulnerability which clings to him. A neighbour at the Shakespeare Book Shop near his home said that Culkin now looks so bad she could easily confuse him with a tramp. He wears ‘vintage’ clothing from secondhand stores, in particular a brown leather women’s jacket, and goes everywhere with his small group of friends. Indeed, it transpires that Culkin, a multi-millionaire thanks to his career as a child actor, has fallen into some unwholesome company. One New York source said: ‘He mixes with a crowd of rich kids who split their time between Miami and New York. They are a fast crowd.’ One fairly new development is a friendship with a rocker Adam Green, from a punk band called the Moldy Peaches. They are so close that Culkin joined the group on a two-month tour of Europe recently, and took to the stage to duet with Green on some of their dates. Green is a fan of the drug ketamine (originally designed to sedate horses). Disturbingly, he persuaded Culkin to star in a ‘ketamine-inspired’ film, The Wrong Ferrari, last year. Shot on an iPhone, it is both puerile and incomprehensible. Green giggled: ‘I was on a lot of ketamine at the time ... It’s a ketamine classic.’ He’s since laid off the drug somewhat, saying: ‘I feel that it’s given me brain damage.’ Green, who lost a bandmate to a drug overdose, has brought Culkin into the orbit of the notorious and hopelessly addicted Pete Doherty, another of his chums who also appeared in the film. So what are we to make of all this? This February, Macaulay Culkin was pictured looking desperately unwell. In the photo, taken in New York, he clutched a tin of Red Bull and looked as if he was ill or suffering some kind of addiction, although his publicist said he was ‘in perfectly good health’. Last week, his story took a dramatic . turn when the National Enquirer published a claim that he is ‘close to . death’, thanks to addictions to prescription drugs and heroin. Then, . photos appeared of a pale and dishevelled Culkin walking along a . Hollywood street clutching his stomach and appearing to retch against an . ivy-clad wall, adding fuel to the rumours that all is not well. Heartbreak: Culkin with his ex-girlfriend, actress Mila Kunis . Culkin’s PR, Michelle Bega, denies it all, calling the report ‘ridiculously and impossibly fictitious’. The staff at a Duane Reade pharmacy store in Manhattan confirmed that Culkin comes in ‘fairly regularly’, but declined to comment further. However, the magazine’s account of Culkin’s alleged addictions is extremely detailed. It claims he is spending £3,800 a month on drugs, a habit which has grown since he was dumped by his girlfriend of eight years, actress Mila Kunis, at the end of 2010. The magazine contends that Culkin is ‘hopelessly hooked’ and quotes sources who say they have seen him use a mixture of drugs. They say he regularly shoots up heroin and the painkiller oxycodone - a semi-synthetic opiate sometimes used by cancer patients. He invites friends for poker parties, which turn into drugs binges with a ‘close circle of whacked-out pals’. A supposed insider told the magazine: ‘He’s been hooked for a year and a half ... Mac is surrounding himself with junkies and lowlifes.’ Another pal allegedly said: ‘Macaulay Culkin is surely dying. He’s addicted to heroin, Oxycodone and the painkillers Percocet and Vicodin. I have witnessed his drug-taking, which has escalated over the past year and a half to the point where he needs serious help.’ The friend says Culkin buys 300 to 400 Vicodin and Percocet painkillers every ten days at $5 per pill. But the high is no longer enough, so he’s shooting up heroin and Oxycodone, too. According to medical experts, the dangers are of a cardiac arrest or cardiac arrhythmia. Why would Culkin play such a deadly game with his health? Rich at 10: The former child star made $70,000 for the first Home Alone movie and £3 million for the sequel . According to the National Enquirer, his descent began when he split with Kunis. He is apparently even more depressed since she started dating fellow actor Ashton Kutcher, who broke up with wife Demi Moore last year. But there are other tragedies in the story of the fall of Macaulay Culkin. Raised with six siblings in a one-bedroom apartment, he started landing movie roles at eight. His father Kit, an actor, started him out on his career when he was only four. He was a millionaire by ten, thanks to the first Home Alone film. He was paid £70,000 for that and £3 million for the sequel. ‘I’d made enough money by the time I was 12 to never have to work again,’ he told an interviewer. At the time, his Home Alone director, the late John Hughes, said of Culkin: ‘He’s got a nice family who care about him, and he certainly hasn’t suffered from all this working.’ But this was a woeful miscalculation. Culkin later said that Kit ruled the family - ‘his kingdom’ - by humiliation, and that even when they all moved into a huge house in New York, which was paid for by Macaulay, the bullying did not stop. In 2004 he said: ‘My father was overbearing. Very controlling. He was always the way he is, even before my success. He’d play mind games to make sure I knew my place.’ At 14, Culkin announced that he was quitting acting. The following year his father left, after which his mother Patricia filed for custody of Macaulay and his siblings, igniting a bitter public battle with Kit. Eventually, Culkin had his parents legally blocked from controlling his £11 million fortune — a move that estranged him for good from his father, who now lives in Arizona. All this - the overbearing father, the lawsuits - calls to mind parallel experiences in the life of Michael Jackson, who became a friend of Culkin’s just after the Home Alone films. Culkin later recalled that Jackson simply rang him up and invited him to come over and play video games. The reason for the friendship, he said, was that they were both eternally eight years old. Culkin loyally testified during a 2009 trial, in which Jackson was accused of molesting another boy, that the singer had never touched him inappropriately. Having skipped his final year of high school, at 17 Culkin married his sweetheart, Rachel Miner. By the time he was 20, they were divorced. There followed a period of promiscuity which ended when he met Mila, a stunning brunette whose big break came in the sitcom That 70s Show. Bad influence?: Culkin has developed a friendship with Moldy Peaches musician Adam Green, a self-confessed drug user . In real life, Culkin played her househusband - walking the dog and keeping house. She said in interviews that he cooked for her every night. There were a couple of forays into the public eye. In 2000, Culkin took on a role in a London play called Madame Melville, and while he was in the UK he wrote a memoir, Junior, which came out in 2006. Part biography, part meditation on fame, it was a curious book which he had wanted to present without putting his name on it. He explained that he felt as if the world owned ‘Macaulay Culkin’ and he didn’t want anything to do with that character. In 2003 he was in the indie film Party People, playing a drug user. The following year, in a case of life imitating art, he was arrested in Oklahoma for marijuana possession. He also had prescription drugs on him. He was fined and given three one-year suspended prison terms. If that was not bad enough, four years ago his sister Dakota was killed in a car accident - a tragedy which his brother Kieran said they had all struggled to cope with. She left a nightclub in Los Angeles and was struck by a car, dying in hospital the following day. Her death didn’t bring the family together. Culkin remains unreconciled to both parents. For the past three years, he has lived in a large apartment in the trendy NoHo area of New York. He has the entire eighth floor. One neighbour is a supermarket magnate. A close friend of Macaulay’s pal Adam Green says that the former child actor is not a recluse, just someone who values his privacy. As Culkin once said: ‘I had all the fame anyone could want, and I ran away from it.’ But the question now is whether running away is doing him even more damage than the fame that he grew to loathe.","Sources say he has been 'hooked for a year and a half'

Together for 21 years: Rolling Stones front man Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall are at war over the £10m mansion they once shared . Jerry Hall was once again on top form at a press conference last week, tossing out snappy quotes and posing in a leopard-print skirt and size eight Louboutin heels. Her wide, red smile, painted on for the cameras, never faltered as she plugged her forthcoming theatrical run in Melbourne as Mrs Robinson in The Graduate. But, 10,000 miles away from that sunny Australian photocall, storm clouds are gathering as she faces up to what, at 56, might be a rather tricky third act in her life. All but one of her four children have . flown the nest and her two-year romance with billionaire property tycoon . Warwick Hemsley has run its course (they split up last September). Meanwhile, her beloved mother, Marjorie, a strong-willed Texan . matriarch, died following a stroke and heart failure earlier this year . at the age of 88. Like many divorcees of a certain age and with an uncertain income, Jerry is looking to the future with nervous eyes. But what, you may ask, has she got to be nervous about? Wasn’t she once married to Mick Jagger, one of the most successful and wealthy men in showbusiness? Surely, a lonely retirement spent in penury is the last thing she needs to fear. In the midst of these major changes in her life, friends say Jerry is turning her attention to her retirement and the eventual fate of her £10 million home in Richmond, south-west London. In fact, she is thinking of selling the 26-room property in order to release funds, a course of action which seems to be putting her on a collision course with her fabulously wealthy ex. For elegant Downe House is the place where she and Jagger raised their family, Lizzie, 28, James, 27, Georgia, 20, and Gabriel, 15. The eldest two Jagger children live in the U.S., model Georgia rents a house with friends in London and Gabriel still lives at home with his mother. Mick and Jerry bought the house, which dates from 1780, in 1991 for £2.25 million. When . they moved in, Jerry was pregnant with Georgia, and Mick was in the . throes of a stormy dalliance with model Carla Bruni, who is now Mrs . Nicolas Sarkozy. Downe House . was the Jaggers’ home for seven years until one night, in November . 1998, when, during a dinner party, Jerry was handed a copy of a . newspaper alleging that the Brazilian model, Luciana Morad, was pregnant . by Jagger. After the baby, Lucas, was born, Mick moved out. Battle ground: Downe House, the £10m property in Richmond, south west London that Jerry wants Mick to sign over to her . In the legal wrangles which followed, it was widely believed that Mick had signed over the house to Jerry. Everyone assumed that Jagger — who is worth around  £200 million and counting — had wanted at least to give her the family home after cheating on her. But the fate of the property wasn’t quite that straightforward. Jerry had to suffer the humiliation of having her marriage annulled in 1999 after it was revealed that the ceremony she and Jagger underwent in Bali in 1990 had no legal validity. Sources said Jerry had been hoping for a ‘divorce’ settlement in the order of £30 million, but I can reveal that she walked away with around a third of that . . . and not one of Jagger’s many properties dotted around the globe. Mick permitted her to stay on in the house in Richmond, but it remained a mutual asset. Now Jerry is asking the man who shared her bed for 21 years to sign it over to her. She has asked him for ‘clarity’ when it comes to the house and his intentions for it. Cha cha ching: Jerry's stint on Strictly Come Dancing last year is thought to have earned her £55,000, and she wrote a tell-all autobiography for HarperCollins in 2009, for which she received a £500,000 advance . A friend of Hall’s says: ‘It is a source of increasing concern to her as she gets older.’ Apparently, she would like to be able to sell the house or leave it to her children, but she can’t while Jagger’s name is still on the deeds. A source told me last week: ‘I know that she has been thinking about it. Her mum has just died and all of that stirs up where you want to be. It could simply be an exercise in finding out what her possibilities are. That said, she will want to sell up when she gets older. At the moment, it’s just her and Gabriel there, and it’s a big house for two people. The upkeep is very expensive, too. When the roof goes, it costs thousands.’ Sources close to Jagger, however, think it highly unlikely Jerry will get her way over this piece of prime real estate. Jagger’s spokesman refused to comment, saying: ‘This is confidential.’ Sources close to the initial separation deal say his lawyers at Smyth Barkham put a complex series of conditions around Jerry continuing to stay there. They say Jagger gave her the house to live in only until she was 65. Conditions also stipulated that, should she remarry or cohabit, she would have to leave Downe House. Another provision stated that if Mick died before Jerry, his heirs could enforce the conditions. Jerry, of course, agreed to all this. She will have been advised by her legal team at Mischcon de Reya that, as an unmarried partner, she had no rights in law. Mick’s view was always that she was the one who wanted a permanent split, and that he was just acting on legal advice to protect what was his. It is fair to say, though, that bricks and mortar exerted some pull over Jagger: within a few months of their split, it emerged that Mick was refusing to leave Downe House. While both of them had moved on emotionally — Jerry dallied with Paul Allen of Microsoft and novelist Edward St Aubyn, Mick with heiress Vanessa Neumann and model Sophie Dahl — they maintained a semblance of family life. Mick bought a flat next door and an entrance was knocked through between the two properties. Here's to you: Mick got into the habit of coming and going as he pleased, and looked after the children on the nights in 2000 when Jerry was playing Mrs Robinson opposite Josh Cohen in The Graduate . Mick got into the habit of coming and going as he pleased, and looked after the children on the nights in 2000 when Jerry was playing Mrs Robinson in London’s West End. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this compromise eventually became intolerable. By 2002, when Jerry was  involved with banker Tim Attias and Mick was dating stylist L’Wren Scott, Jerry asked him to move on. Attias was reportedly unsettled by the idea of Jagger watching him come and go. Jagger moved into a suite at Claridge’s Hotel in Mayfair which cost him £2,500 a night. That should have been that. But, rather awkwardly, Mick’s girlfriend L’Wren Scott was pictured sneaking out of the Richmond house on the eve of a Rolling Stones concert at nearby Twickenham in 2003. Jerry was in San Francisco playing Mrs Robinson at the time, and was reportedly furious. Fashionable romance: Mick Jagger is now with fashion designer L'Wren Scott . A source close to Mick said: ‘Jerry doesn’t want him parading his new girlfriend in front of their kids and he was happy to respect her wishes. ‘But his hotel bill was mounting up and he took his chance to move back in while Jerry was away in the U.S. He is going to have a lot of explaining to do now they have been caught.’ This was swiftly followed the next year by a row over antiques and paintings at Downe House. Mick let Jerry know that the furnishings, ornaments and paintings in Richmond were his and said that he wanted them back. Among them were Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein originals and several Old Masters, said to be worth up to £30 million. The valuables were placed in storage, at a cost of more than £400,000 a year, and were later moved into Mick’s new property, a house in Chelsea, West London, which he bought in 2006. By then, relations between him and Jerry were at an all-time low, not helped by Jerry’s failed romance with explorer Benedict Waud, and Mick’s continued happiness with L’Wren, who is still his girlfriend. The following year, it became clear that Downe House needed a great deal of maintenance work. Mick and Jerry agreed to split the £100,000 bill, but were ‘barely on speaking terms’ over it. Since then, however, relations have improved. Jerry said last year: ‘Mick’s funny, brilliantly talented and quite easy to live with — except for the infidelity. ‘We’re very good friends now. He calls most days. He’s so funny.’ Jerry has continued to work on stage, TV and modelling endorsements. Her stint on Strictly Come Dancing last year is thought to have earned her £55,000, and she wrote a tell-all autobiography for HarperCollins in 2009, for which she received a £500,000 advance. But the book was never published after Jerry failed to dish enough dirt. Rather than elaborate on Mick’s shortcomings, she chose to return her advance. She did, though, say the project was not necessarily permanently shelved. ‘I’m not ready to put it out yet . . . maybe in a few years,’ she said. Was this a coded warning to Jagger? Perhaps if the battle for Downe House hots up, we may finally get to read her unvarnished account of what life with the Rolling Stone was like.","Jerry Hall wants Mick Jagger to sign over Downe House to her .

We should be in a position defending the existence of Syria. We are not in a battle for an individual or a regime,' Sharaa was quoted as saying. Fighting: Mannequins are erected to distract snipers loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in Aleppo's Khan al-Wazeer district . Battle: A Free Syrian Army fighter takes position as he points his weapon . 'The opposition cannot decisively settle the battle and what the security forces and army units are doing will not achieve a decisive settlement,' he told the paper, adding that the insurgents fighting to topple Syria's leadership could plunge it into 'anarchy and an unending spiral of violence'. Sources close to the Syrian government say Sharaa had pushed for dialogue with the opposition and objected to the military response to an uprising that began peacefully. In Damascus, residents said on Monday the army had told people to evacuate the Palestinian district of Yarmouk, suggesting an all-out military offensive on the southern district was imminent. Injured: Free Syrian Army figthers (FSA) helping a comrade after being shot by a Syrian Army sniper, during an operation of taking control of Al Mosthat sprawling military base . Ammunition: Machine gun rounds are seen near to a Syrian Army trench after heavy clashes with government forces at a military academy besieged by the rebels in Tal Sheer . The centre of the city, largely insulated from the violence for 21 months, is now full of army and vigilante checkpoints and shakes to the sound of regular shelling, residents say. Queues for bread form at bakeries hours before dawn, as people seek out dwindling supplies, power cuts are increasing and fears are growing that Damascus could descend into chaos. In a veiled criticism of the crackdown, Sharaa said there was a difference between the state's duty to provide security to its citizens, and 'pursuing a security solution to the crisis.' He said even Assad could not be certain where events in Syria were leading, but that anyone who met him would hear that 'this is a long struggle...and he does not hide his desire to settle matters militarily to reach a final solution.' Killed: The body of a Syrian Army soldier lies in a trench after heavy clashes . 'We realise today that change is inevitable,' Sharaa said, but 'none of the peaceful or armed opposition groups with their known foreign links can call themselves the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people'. 'Likewise the current leadership...cannot achieve change alone after two years of crisis without new partners who contribute to preserving (Syria's) national fabric, territorial unity and regional sovereignty'. Rebels have now brought the war to the capital, without yet delivering a fatal blow to the government. But nor has Assad found the military muscle to oust his opponents from the city. In Paris, Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius of France, one of the powers most insistent that Assad has lost his legitimacy, said: 'I think the end is nearing for Bashar al-Assad.' On the ground, rebels said they were launching an operation to seize the central province of Hama to try to link northern rural areas of Syria under their control to the centre. Qassem Saadeddine, a member of the newly established rebel military command, said fighters had been ordered to surround and attack checkpoints across the province. Battle: Free Syrian Army fighter looks at the body of a Syrian Army soldier after heavy clashes with government forces . He said forces loyal to Assad had been given 48 hours to surrender or be killed. 'When we liberate the countryside of Hama province ... then we will have the area between Aleppo and Hama liberated and open for us,' he told Reuters. The city of Hama in the province of the same name has a special resonance for anti-Assad activists. In 1982 Hafez al-Assad, father of the current ruler, crushed an uprising in the city, killing up to 30,000 civilians. In Damascus, activists said fighter jets bombed the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp on Sunday, killing at least 25 people sheltering in a mosque. The attack was part of a month-old campaign by Assad's forces to eject rebels from positions they are establishing around the capital's perimeter. Yarmouk, to the south, falls within an arc of territory running from the east of Damascus to the southwest from where rebels hope to storm the government's main redoubt. Fighting: Syrian people seen near a damaged building after it was attacked by a Syrian Army Jet in Azaz . Destroyed: Syrian people survey the damage . Opposition activists said the deaths in Yarmouk, to which refugees have fled from fighting in nearby suburbs, resulted from a rocket fired from a warplane hitting the mosque. Footage showed bodies and body parts scattered on the stairs of what appeared to be the mosque. The latest battlefield accounts could not be independently verified due to tight restrictions on media access to Syria. Syria is home to more that 500,000 Palestinian refugees, most living in Yarmouk, and both Assad's government and the rebels have enlisted and armed Palestinians as the uprising, which began as a peaceful street movement 21 months ago, has mushroomed into a civil war. After Sunday's air raid, clashes flared between Palestinians from the pro-Assad Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC) and rebels including other Palestinian fighters and some PFLP-GC fighters were killed. In the latest of a string of military installations to fall to the rebels, the army's infantry college north of Aleppo was captured on Saturday after five days of fighting, a rebel commander with the powerful Islamist Tawheed Brigade said. NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel, one of the most prominent and accomplished international correspondents in the world, has been missing in the country for several days. Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reports that Engel, together with Turkish journalist Aziz Akyavaş, were last known to be in Syria and haven't been in contact with NBC News since Thursday morning. While the Turkish media have been circulating the report for several days, American outlets had been operating under a news blackout requested by NBC until yesterday.","Farouq al-Sharaa says neither Assad nor the rebels can can win the war .

"By . James Chapman . UPDATED: . 05:53 EST, 4 November 2011 . The Treasury is preparing to put further billions of pounds of taxpayers’ cash at risk under emergency plans for the break-up of the euro. The money will be made available to the International Monetary Fund to help solve the debt crisis threatening to tip the world into the worst depression since the 1930s. But David Cameron’s commitment at the G20 summit in Cannes to increase Britain’s £29billion IMF contribution left him facing another fight with Tory eurosceptics. They insist Britain should not offer a penny more to bail out debt-stricken European economies – even indirectly through the IMF. Crisis talks: French president and host Nicolas Sarkozy (left) talks . with, from left, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, US President Barack Obama and UK Prime Minister David Cameron .

The situation in Greece, meanwhile, . is becoming more chaotic by the minute. Last night Germany and France . effectively blackmailed Athens into abandoning a referendum that . threatened to bring down the single currency. They warned Greece would be expelled from the EU if it pressed ahead. There were even claims that Europe’s . big two had gone behind Mr Papandreou’s back and directly contacted the . Greek opposition about how to crush the referendum and get the euro . rescue agreed – a move likely to prompt claims of a Brussels-inspired . ‘coup’. George Papandreou is still clinging on as prime minister and trying to stitch together a national unity government. Constantine Michaelos of the Athens Chamber of Commerce said last night that ‘nobody’ was running the country. Distracted: Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's attention appears to be elsewhere as talks get underway at G20 . Amid increasing signs that . preparations are being made for a Greek exit from the eurozone, Jean . Claude Juncker, the president of the currency grouping, said: ‘We are . working on the subject of how to ensure there is not a disaster for the . people in Germany, Luxembourg, the eurozone. Debt-riddled Portugal last night demanded softer terms for its £67billion bailout. Portuguese prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho said he wanted to negotiate a more flexible deal to help the economy recover from recession. The move will alarm leaders in other European countries amid fears that Greece is on the verge of collapse and the crisis could spread to larger economies such as Italy and Spain. But Mr Passos Coelho insisted that Lisbon has no intention of watering down its commitment to lower its debts and implement hard-hitting reforms to boost growth. Portugal was the third eurozone country to need a bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund following Greece and Ireland. With the economic and political crisis in Greece threatening to bring the country down, European leaders will be desperate to prevent a re-run in Portugal. British taxpayers have stumped up around £12.5billion to support the three countries and save the single currency. Portugal was forced to accept a £67billion bailout six months ago as fears over its towering debts and ailing economy drove its interest rates to unaffordable levels. In exchange for the money, Portugal agreed to harsh austerity measures that now threaten to choke off the growth needed to climb out debt. Mr Passos Coelho said Portugal does not need more bailout money but ‘more flexible conditions to implement the programme, not a new programme’. He did not specify what changes he is seeking. ‘We are absolutely prepared for the . situation. We are absolutely prepared for the situation which I describe . and which I want to be avoided.’ But as fears grew that Italy’s . ‘basket-case’ economy is weeks away from meltdown, Chancellor George . Osborne said the Treasury was preparing for ‘all contingencies’. In the Commons, Treasury minister . Mark Hoban went further, declaring: ‘I don’t think there’s any intention . for us to join the euro at a time when it is breaking up.’ China has rebuffed humiliating . requests for it to contribute to the £880billion eurozone rescue fund . announced to great fanfare in Brussels last week, but which quickly . turned out to have no new money committed to it. However China does appear ready to . boost its shareholding in the IMF, which makes loans to beleaguered . economies and imposes austerity measures on them in return. Britain is prepared to increase its . £29billion commitment toward the IMF’s total firepower of £600billion . and led calls for a massive increase in its resources. Diplomatic sources said they expected . the fund to be increased by hundreds of billions in a deal that could . be unveiled as early as today. The Prime Minister said: ‘When the . world is in crisis, it is right that you consider boosting the . International Monetary Fund, an organisation founded by Britain in which . we are a leading player. ‘No government ever lost money by . lending to the IMF that supports countries right around the world. But . what we wouldn’t support is the IMF investing directly in some euro . bailout fund. ‘That wouldn’t be right and we won’t . back it.’ Mr Osborne said the G20 negotiations were getting down to the . ‘nitty gritty of numbers’. Asked why British money should be put . at risk to help bail out eurozone countries, Mr Osborne said that . taxpayers from around the world, including those in America and China, . would be ‘exposed’. He also pointed out that even if a . country ends up being unable to repay any of its other debts, it will . still have to pay the IMF. Reflective: Barack Obama (left) and David Cameron are caught on camera in more unguarded moments at G20 in Cannes . The Chancellor said he had been . proposing an increase in IMF resources for several months, and insisted . the eurozone must proceed with its own rescue plan outlined last week, . which includes writing off 50 per cent of Greece’s debts and . recapitalising vulnerable banks. A ‘Robin Hood’ tax on bankers across Europe would cost Britain more than £25billion and ‘cripple’ the fragile economy, a report warns today. Plans by French president Nicolas Sarkozy to introduce a levy on financial transactions would hit the UK harder than anywhere else and ‘ruin the City of London’, according to the Adam Smith Institute. The report says the tax would wipe out the London-dominated market for derivatives, a type of complex financial investment, and drive business overseas. Pressure is mounting on David Cameron and George Osborne to agree to the tax to help resolve the global economic crisis and tackle poverty and climate change. Microsoft founder Bill Gates yesterday threw his weight behind the tax, which has also been backed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. But Downing Street is opposed unless the tax is global, and has pledged to veto any attempt to introduce it across the EU. Mr Osborne says the ‘necessary international consensus does not exist’ to impose the tax. But Tory rebels were last night . threatening to try to force a Commons vote – raising the prospect that . they could combine with Labour MPs to defeat the government. When Parliament last voted to . increase Britain’s contribution, 32 Tories defied a three-line whip to . vote against the government. If more of the 81 Euro-rebels who . defied Mr Cameron by supporting an EU referendum last month signed up, . the coalition could crash to a humiliating defeat. Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: . ‘Ministers need to level with the British people and tell them the truth . – the Government wants to send even more British money to the IMF to . bail out euro basket cases.’ Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘There will . have to be another vote. Greece can’t solve its economic problems while . it’s in the euro. If it came out I would support IMF money being used . because Greece could devalue its currency and rebuild but, while it . remains in, this is just a disguised bung to Euroland.’ Mark Pritchard, who helped coordinate . the 81 rebellion, said: ‘Whether it’s a direct or an indirect bailout, I . don’t think  British taxpayers should be expected to pay another penny . towards the failing euro project.’ Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls last night . made clear Labour would vote against another IMF handout if it ends up . with eurozone countries: ‘The IMF’s job is to support individual . countries with solvency crises, not to solve a structural problem caused . by eurozone countries being unable to agree the necessary steps to . support and maintain their monetary union.’ Crunch time: Mr Obama towers over his French counterpart ahead of the start of the G20 summit in Paris .

Paranormal activity: The father, from Tasmania, Australia, originally rigged up the camera to capture ghosts he thought were haunting his house . The 28-year-old woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, pleaded guilty at Australia's Supreme Court to five counts of sex with a minor, claiming she hadn't realised 16 was below the age of consent. The court heard how the affair began when she went into her de facto stepson's bedroom weeks earlier to discuss his driving lessons. But the conversation soon turned to tickling, then kissing, cuddling and sex, the court heard. She later took the boy upstate where they had sex several times in a hotel room.

The elementary school in which seven children died after a monster tornado barreled through an Oklahoma . City suburb was ready for the twister, despite not having a shelter, experts claim. Yesterday there was growing disbelief as cost-cutting state leaders revealed that even after a devastating tornado struck the area 14 years ago, most schools in Oklahoma still had no purpose-built shelters. And as Moore's mayor claimed that the . death toll could have been over a thousand if so many residents hadn't . been able to hide in underground shelters, questions were raised about if the children could have survived if they were in a shelter. Scroll down for video . Pulled from the rubble: A boy is saved from Plaza Towers Elementary School, which did not have a storm shelter . But Albert Ashwood, director of the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management, told reporters a shelter would not necessarily have saved more lives at the Plaza Towers Elementary School, where seven children sheltering in above-ground classrooms were killed. Ken . Trump, a Cleveland-based national school-safety consultant said the . staff has been well trained in preparing for the tragedy. 'When you have any loss of life, . especially children, it rips our hearts out. But had the community not . had that history, the preparedness lessons learned right in their own . back yard, the losses could have been even worse,' he said reported USA Today. In May 1999, the area was ravaged by a . fierce tornado that killed 44. Many residents responded by building . their own underground tornado shelters at their own expense. But, . incredibly, school children were not afforded the same protection. Plaza Towers Elementary School was in the direct path of this week's tornado and was reduced to a pile of twisted metal and rubble. Around half the children stayed inside, finding shelter where they could in bathrooms. Seven are believed to have drowned. An online petition was set up by a member of the public within hours of the tragedy demanding that shelters be put in every school, apartment building and mobile home park in Oklahoma. Glenn Lewis, the mayor of the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore, claimed most schools in the state did not have special shelters except those rebuilt after being destroyed in the 1999 tornado. 'Most of the schools in Oklahoma do not have shelters. It's because of the cost,' he told CNN. 'The new ones that were hit in the 1999 tornado, they do have built-in shelters.' Before the storm: An aerial photograph shows Plaza Towers Elementary School before it was hit by the monster tornado on Monday . Destruction: An aerial view shows the school after the two mile-wide tornado touched down on Monday . He insisted that this gaping hole in the city's safety precautions would now belatedly be rectified. 'It's something that we’re definitely going to look at,' he said. 'The school system and the city are two separate entities but I'm sure we’ll be talking to them to try and get them federal emergency money to help rebuild these schools.' Mark McBride, a state congressman who represents Moore, said he was 'just choking back tears, trying to be strong' as he helped rescuers search through the rubble. Defending the lack of school tornado shelters, he said education already accounted for a large proportion of local government spending. 'Our budgets are stretched and education takes a lot of the money - 50 plus per cent,' he said. He admitted school shelters 'had not been a priority' but predicted that would now change. Missing: Family members have said that Janae Hornsby, left, and Sydney Angle, right, are missing . Tragedy: Eight-year-old Kyle Davis died instantly after the tornado struck his school Monday afternoon . In an emotional speech during a press conference on Tuesday, Susan Pierce, from Moore Public Schools, said that safety was their priority. 'I would like to extend my sincere sympathies to all those who have suffered losses,' she said. 'Our hearts go out to each of you and please know we are all here with you.' She added that while the path of the tornado was unpredictable, all storm procedures were implemented at every school site. It comes as it also emerged . that a storm shelter program that officials had devised for Moore was . put on hold just months before the town was flattened by the deadly two . mile-wide tornado. Officials had devised a plan to help . residents build storm shelters and applied for $2 million from the . Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to build safe rooms in 800 . homes in Moore. 'It is the . desire of the City to assist persons who are in Moore to have a place to . seek refuge from severe weather,' the letter read. But . a letter which was released by the city in February and first seen by . the Daily Telegraph shows that the program was put on hold as . authorities tried to navigate federal regulations. Hide out: A man looks down what appears to be a storm shelter in the aftermath of the tornado . The officials predicted in the storm . shelters should receive their final approval date of November 1, 2012. In . the letter, the city said regulations put in place by FEMA for the . money were a 'constantly moving target', which had slowed down progress . at getting federal funds. In . another complication, the federal grant program that was giving out the . money they desired allocates its funds during Presidential major . disaster declarations, the letter said. 'Oklahoma . has had few of these declarations in the past couple of years, so there . is not a lot of grant money available,' it explained. The statement, which was released in February on the city's website, revealed the city's frustrations. 'The . City's safe room rebate program is still ""on hold"", with not a lot . changed from our update of last May,' it read. 'We've found that the . FEMA requirements and their interpretations seem to be a constantly . moving target, more so with the new wrinkles.' Officials said they hoped to have another plan submitted by March, yet it is unknown if this went through. Search: Two firefighters break through concrete during the search for survivors at Plaza Towers . Shelters are not compulsory in the state despite its location in so-called Tornado Alley. Basements are rare in the state . because of the damp soil, meaning water seeps into storm cellars and . basements, which leads to mold and fungus. Water . pressure can also build up due to the soaked soil, which puts pressure . on basement walls and the concrete can eventually give way. 'People think they can dodge the bullet,' said Mr McBride when asked why schools had no shelters. 'We haven't had a major one [tornado] since 1999. We're brave and stand in our driveways watching the storms go by.' Oklahoma's Lieutenant Governor, Todd Lamb, dismissed reports that the ground was so hard in the state that it was impossible to dig out a basement without using dynamite. Nothing left: American flags wave over the remains of Plaza Towers Elementary school on Tuesday . He claimed some schools used basements instead of purpose built underground shelters. But he had to admit that the basement under Plaza Towers proved to be a death trap. 'There are basements, there are shelters. But of course not everybody has one,' he said. Neither Moore nor Oklahoma City have designated public storm shelters, and residents are told to go to their basements or storm cellars if they have them. If they do not, they are advised to go to interior hallways and to stay away from windows.","Plaza Towers Elementary School was a direct hit during the tornado .

"By . Becky Evans . PUBLISHED: . 12:25 EST, 15 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:16 EST, 15 May 2013 . Jimmy Savile's Highland home, where he once entertained Prince Charles, is being sold off later this month with a £100,000 price tag. The whitewashed cottage in Glencoe will go under the hammer at auction in Glasgow. Proceeds from the sale will be added to the disgraced presenter's estate to help pay compensation to his hundreds of sex-abuse victims. Jimmy Savile's Glencoe cottage will be auctioned this month with a price tag of £100,000. It has been targeted by vandals for a second time . Vandals daubed 'Glen Savile' in red paint across the white washed walls of the remote cottage . The proceeds of the cottage sale will be added to Savile's estate . Glasgow-based property firm Ross Harper Property Auctions confirmed that Savile's Allt-Na-Reigh home is included in their auction at Glasgow's Grand Central Hotel on May 30, with a guide price of £100,000. The sale comes as vandals once again targeted the home - smashing windows and writing 'Glen Savile' across the front wall in red paint. It is the second time in months that the serial paedophile's Scottish home has been attacked. A spokesman at Ross Harper said: 'Obviously there has been a lot of interest in this property and it is included in our list for auction at the end of the month with a guide price of £100,000. 'Full details of the property will be available shortly.' The future of Allt-Na-Reigh has split the local community since the Jim'll Fix It star was unmasked as Britain's worst serial sex offender. Some have suggested the remote cottage - previously owned by mountaineering legend Hamish MacInnes - should be demolished while others are campaigning to have it preserved as a museum or climbing refuge. Trustees NatWest Bank has frozen Savile's £4.3million estate and any money raised from the sale will be added to the estate. Compensation claims are unlikely to be contested by Savile's estate because of the mountain of damning evidence against the disgraced presenter and could be concluded within a year. Solicitor Alan Collins, whose Manchester-based firm Pannone is representing more than 40 Savile victims, said: 'If the estate chooses to fight the claims - which is unlikely given the evidence - then compensation claims could take years. 'If they chose to get things resolved then we are probably looking at less than a year.' Savile's secluded Highland bolthole was attacked by vandals in November who sprayed 'Jimmy The Beast' graffiti messages over the walls. The fresh attack last week came after the walls had been repainted ahead of a planned sale. Prince Charles visited Savile's Glencoe cottage and had dinner there in 1999 . Windows in the remote cottage have been smashed in the second attack on the home since November . Paedophile Savile famously had Prince Charles for dinner in 1999 at the home near Glencoe . Protective wooden covers had been forced off one window which was smashed - sending glass across the main lounge of Savile's former home. Hamish MacInnes, 82, founder of the Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team said he would like to see his former home turned into a place for climbers visiting the area to stay.

Savile's trustees NatWest have frozen his £4.3million estate and money from the house sale will be added to it . Savile maintained it was his dream to live in the Highlands and he spent huge sums converting the home, adding glass walls, mains water and sewage as well as modernising its decor throughout. The broadcaster bought the Glencoe house in 1998 after falling in love with it on a cycling holiday in 1944. Operation Yewtree - the high profile investigation into sex allegations against a string of celebrities - discovered 450 Savile victims but officers fear hundreds more are still too scared to speak out. Detectives revealed in January how they had recorded 214 alleged sex offences committed by the BBC presenter who died in October 2011 aged 84. The Top of The Pops host's sickening catalogue of abuse spanned decades and he is even accused of preying on a dying child at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital. Detectives are still unsure whether any offences happened in Glencoe but said it remained an important part of their investigation.","The cottage in Glencoe is being auctioned at the end of May .

A prize one ton bull had to be put down after it was savaged by two American bulldogs. The animals 'shredded' one of the Limousin's ears and left it covered in blood after the attack in its farm pen. Dog owner Leanne Meredith, 33, wept in court after she heard an application will be made to destroy her two American bulldogs, Murphy and Miley. She was found guilty at the court in Holyhead, Anglesey, of allowing the dogs to worry livestock and a charge under the Dangerous Dogs Act of allowing them to enter a place where they were not permitted to be. In a separate trial, Meredith was today found guilty of allowing a third dog to worry sheep. In the bull attack, one farm worker told the court that he feared for his life when the dogs attacked at Tynygongl, near Benllech, on Anglesey, in July last year. District Judge Andrew Shaw heard that one of the dogs broke its jaw in the attack but that the bull, called Hercules, later became infertile and was put down. Both dogs are being held in secure kennels and the judge said it will decide on whether they should be destroyed. Judge Shaw rejected Meredith's claim that the attack had taken place after the bull had strayed on to her property and the dogs were defending themselves, or that prosecution witnesses were lying. The judge heard that the bull had later become infertile and was put down. In the second trial, single mother . Meredith, who now lives in Wimbledon, south London, was found guilty of a . further Dangerous Dogs Act charge relating to another dog, Humphrey, . and also admitted allowing him to worry sheep. Murphy, pictured, and Miley left the one ton bull covered in blood and 'shredded' one of its ears . An application has been made to destroy Miley, pictured, and Murphy, following the attack . This followed an incident last September in which Murphy was one of three dogs which escaped and attacked a flock of sheep on land adjoining a caravan site at Tynygongl. Nine sheep died. The farmer shot dead two dogs not belonging to the defendant, and Humphrey, a French Bordeaux, was shot in the head. He was found a few days later but was almost blinded and is now being looked after by a member of the family. A decision on whether to destroy Humphrey has not yet been made. District Judge Shaw adjourned sentence on all the cases until next month and ordered a report from the probation service. The one-ton prize Limousin bull called Hercules, similar to the one pictured, had to be put down . Nia Lloyd, prosecuting, said there will be applications for destruction orders, compensation, disqualification from keeping dogs, and court costs. Kennel fees for Murphy and Miley have so far amounted to £11,318. Barrister Paul Humpherson, defending, said Meredith had kept dogs without trouble all her life, mainly in London, and that Humphrey was normally docile and safe with children. 'I wouldn't make a destruction order unless I felt I had to,' the judge said.","Limousin, called Hercules, had ear 'shredded' in attack on farm in Anglesey .

Scroll down for video . More than $73,000 has been raised to buy a video allegedly showing Toronto mayor Rob Ford smoking crack . Journalists from the Star and Gawker . say they have seen the clip and said it was taken by a man who claimed . he sold crack to Ford. The media outlets have jointly organised the Rob Ford Crackstarter campaign on crowdsourcing website Indiegogo. It . is being sold by a dealer, believed to be from the city's Somali . community, who said he wants the money to get out of Toronto and begin a . new life elsewhere. In brief comments outside his office, Ford said it was 'another story with respect to the Toronto Star going after . me. And that's all I've got to say for now.' Toronto police spokesman Mark Pugash said investigators were 'monitoring the situation closely.' The Star said that two reporters . watched a video that appears to show Ford, sitting in a chair, inhaling . from what appears to be a glass crack pipe. The Star said it did not . obtain the video or pay to watch it. The Star also reported that Ford made an . anti-gay slur against the leader of the federal Liberal Party of . Canada, Justin Trudeau. It is also alleged that Ford says: 'Everyone expects me to be right-wing'.

The Toronto Star and Gawker are raising money to buy the clip . The Star alleges that Ford makes an anti-gay slur against Justin Trudeau (pictured), the Federal Liberal Party leader . He said on Indiegogo: '[Ford] is red-faced and sweaty, heaving with each breath. Finally, he finds his moment and lights up. He inhales.' The two organisations said they wanted to buy the video so Toronto residents can watch it themselves. Both agencies said if $200,000 was not raised within eight days, the funds would be donated to a drugs treatment charity. Ford did not respond to the Associated Press's messages seeking comment.

During . his campaign for mayor, Ford held a news conference to discuss a 1999 . arrest for marijuana possession in Florida. He ultimately pleaded guilty . to driving under the influence and failing to give a breath sample to . police. While in . office, he has been accused of flouting conflict of interest rules and . making obscene gestures at residents from his car.

"By . Becky Evans . PUBLISHED: . 19:27 EST, 20 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:31 EST, 21 May 2013 . Apple has avoided paying billions in income tax by using dummy headquarters abroad, according to a damaging U.S. Senate report, but Ireland has today denied it is to blame. An investigation by a Senate committee . said the tech giant sought the 'Holy Grail of tax avoidance' schemes by not declaring tax residency in any country. Irish deputy prime minister Eamon Gilmore today said it was not to blame for Apple Inc's low global tax payments and said they had no special rate with the company. The denial comes after the Senate . said Apple paid little or no tax on tens of billions of dollars stashed . in Irish subsidiaries. Senate investigation found Apple uses affiliate companies in Ireland (pictured) to avoid billions in U.S. income tax . The report, published yesterday by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations yesterday, found that Apple holds $102billion of its $145billion in cash. An Irish subsidiary that earned $22billion in 2011 paid only $10million in taxes. The Irish government, which has seen . the luring of U.S. multinationals with low taxes as a key part of its . economic policy since the 1960s, said its system was transparent and . other countries were responsible if the tax rate paid by Apple was too . low. He told national broadcaster RTE: . 'They are issues that arise from the taxation systems in other . jurisdictions, and that is an issue that has to be addressed first of . all in those jurisdictions.' The Senate subcommittee identified three subsidiaries that have no tax residency either in Ireland, where they are incorporated, or in the United States, where those companies are managed. The main subsidiary, a holding company that includes Apple's retail stores throughout Europe, has not paid any corporate income tax in the last five years, the report said. The report said: 'Ireland has essentially functioned as a tax haven for Apple'. ‘Apple wasn't satisfied with shifting . its profits to a low-tax offshore tax haven,’ Sen. Carl Levin, . D-Mich., the subcommittee's chairman, said. ‘Apple sought the Holy Grail of . tax avoidance. It has created offshore entities holding tens of billions . of dollars, while claiming to be tax resident nowhere.’ The subcommittee's report estimates that . Apple avoided at least $3.5billion in U.S. federal taxes in 2011 and . $9 billion in 2012. Apple uses five affiliate companies located in Ireland to carry out its tax strategy, according to the report. The companies are located at the same address in Cork, Ireland, and they share members of their boards of directors. Horses graze over the road from the Ireland Apple headquarters on the edge of Cork . Senator Carl Levin, right, said Apple sought 'the Holy Grail of tax avoidance' but company CEO Tim Cook, left, who is traveling to Washington on Tuesday, said they follow the letter and spirit of tax laws . While all five companies were incorporated in Ireland, only two of them also have tax residency in that country. That . means the other three are not legally required to pay taxes in Ireland . because they are not managed or controlled in that country, in Apple's . view. The report says Apple capitalizes on a difference between U.S. and Irish rules regarding tax residency. In Ireland, a company must be . managed and controlled in the country to be a tax resident. Under U.S. law, a company is a tax resident of the country in which it was . established. Therefore, the Apple companies are not tax residents of Ireland nor of the U.S., since they were not incorporated in the U.S. The company, based in . Cupertino, California, paid $2.5billion in federal taxes in 2011 and $6billion in 2012. The strategies Apple uses are legal, and many other multinational corporations use similar tax techniques to avoid paying U.S. income taxes on profits they reap overseas. However, the tactics have raised questions about loopholes in the U.S. tax code, lawmakers say. The spotlight on Apple's tax strategy comes at a time of fevered debate in Washington over whether and how to raise revenues to help reduce the federal deficit. Many Democrats complain that the government is missing out on collecting billions because companies are stashing profits abroad and avoiding taxes. Republicans want to cut the corporate . tax rate of 35 per cent and ease the tax burden on money that U.S. companies make abroad. They say the move would encourage companies to . invest at home. Apple . CEO Tim Cook, the company's chief financial officer and its tax chief . are scheduled to testify and explain the company's tax strategy at a . hearing by the subcommittee today. Apple's main headquarters are in California (pictured) but they have no apparent tax residency, the report said . The . company refuted the subcommittee's assertions in testimony prepared for . the hearing and released to the public yesterday evening. Apple . said it employs tens of thousands of Americans and pays ‘an . extraordinary amount’ in U.S. taxes, citing the roughly $6billion it . paid in fiscal 2012. Apple . ‘complies fully with both the laws and the spirit of the laws,’ the . testimony says. ‘And Apple pays all its required taxes, both in this . country and abroad. Apple does not use tax gimmicks.' The . company insisted that it does not, as the subcommittee asserts, move . its intellectual property rights into offshore tax havens and use it to . sell products back into the U.S. to avoid taxes. The . company has made clear that given current U.S. tax rates, it has no . intention of repatriating its overseas profits to the U.S. Apple reiterated in its testimony its . support for comprehensive tax reform as a way to support economic . growth and boost U.S. companies' competitiveness. The subcommittee also has examined . the tax strategies of Microsoft Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and other . multinational companies, finding that they too have avoided billions in . U.S. taxes by shifting profits offshore and exploiting weak, ambiguous . sections of the tax code. Microsoft has used ‘aggressive’ transactions to shift assets to subsidiaries in Puerto Rico, Ireland and . Singapore, in part to avoid taxes. HP has used complex offshore loan . transactions worth billions while using the money to run its U.S. operations, according to the panel. Apple says it 'complies fully with both the laws and the spirit of the laws' and pays all required taxes . The subcommittee's inquiry and . hearing are intended to shine a light on ‘offshore tax-avoidance . tactics’ by Apple, Levin said at a news conference Monday with Sen. John . McCain of Arizona, the panel's senior Republican. Companies' use of such loopholes has . the effect of raising the taxes of ordinary Americans and increasing the . federal deficit, he said. McCain said that while Apple claims . to be the biggest U.S. corporate taxpayer, it is also ‘among America's . largest tax avoiders.’ He . called Apple's strategy ‘an egregious and really outrageous scheme that . Apple has been able to orchestrate to avoid paying taxes.’ The subcommittee report also noted that Apple has been setting aside billions for tax bills it may never pay. As previously reported by The . Associated Press, the overlooked asset that Apple has been building up . could boost Apple's profits by as much as $10.5billion. However, Apple . has been lobbying to change U.S. law so it can erase its tax liabilities . in a less conspicuous fashion. In its second quarter ended March 31, . Apple posted its first profit decline in ten years. Net income was . $9.5billion, or $10.09 a share, down 18 per cent from $11.6billion, or . $12.30 a share, in the same period a year ago. Revenue increased 11 per . cent, to $43.6billion. Apple said in April that it will distribute $100 billion in cash to its shareholders by the end of 2015. The company is expanding its share . buyback program to $60billion, the largest buyback authorization in . history, and is raising its quarterly dividend by 15 per cent, to $3.05 a . share. In Monday's regular trading session, Apple's stock rose $9.67, or 2.23 per cent, to close at $442.93. President . Barack Obama has proposed using the tax code to encourage companies to . move jobs back to the U.S. and discourage them from shifting jobs . abroad. Amazon is one of the multinationals that have been criticized over its tax affairs . Apple is the latest multinational to be hit by tax avoidance accusations. Investigations are currently underway in both the U.S. and UK into corporations who have a turnover of billions but pay a fraction of that in taxes. In the UK, Google was accused of doing evil' by a Parliamentary committee after MPs claimed the internet giant by using 'devious, calculated and unethical' trucks to minimize its liabilities. It paid just £7.3million in corporation tax last year despite having a UK turnover of £3billion. Elsewhere, Amazon could be investigated by the UK Public Accounts Committee after paying just £2.44million in corporation tax on UK sales of £320million last year. But the Seattle-based group told its investors that it actually made 13 times this amount, claiming the UK sales were actually more than £4billion. Starbucks was one of the first companies to be accused of tax avoidance when the row erupted last year. It has since agreed to pay £20million in tax voluntarily after a public boycott over revelations it had paid no corporation tax since 2009. France has also said it will fight tax avoidance and President Francois Hollande has called for the 'eradication' of tax havens. He told French banks last month that they must declare any foreign subsidiaries each year as he presented a draft law drawn up in response to the country's recent tax scandal.","Senate subcommittee says Apple skipped $9billion in federal taxes in 2012 .

Four years ago they were to be reunited when Chrissie, looking for closure, wrote a letter to Tim. They fell in love all over again and quickly married. But while the couple were delighted to be reunited, their road to happiness was not to be a smooth one. Just four years after their emotional reunion, Chrissie endured a horrific road accident that left her with a severe head injury fighting for her life in intensive care. Chrissie and Tim were apart for 20 years after calling off their engagement, but reunited four years ago . The tragic incident featured in last night's episode of award-winning C4 documentary series 24 Hours In A&E. Filmed at Kings . College Hospital in London following the accident, it was revealed that 47-year-old Chrissie, who works as a secretary in an investment bank, was crossing a road 500 metres from her home in London when she was knocked down by a motorcyclist. The left side of Chrissie's face took the force of the impact, and she suffered a concussion as well as totally shattering her left eye socket. She fractured the lateral, medial, posterior and inferior wall of her left eye socket when the motorbike hit her. At the hospital she was found to have suffered a concussion from the impact to her . head, and remained confused and disorientated during her treatment. As soon as Tim hears Chrissie has been injured, he rushes to hospital to be with her - but ironically gets stuck in the very traffic jam caused by Chrissie's accident. Once there, he can be seen sitting diligently by his wife’s side, . holding her hand and comforting her in heart-warming scenes that sum up . this extraordinary couple's journey. Chrissie was hit by a motorbike while crossing the road, and Tim rushed to be by her bedside . The left side of Chrissie's face took the force of the impact, and she suffered a concussion as well as totally shattering her left eye socket . Recalling their rocky road to romance . Tim, who works as a driver for a fashion company, says: ‘It was 20-odd . years ago, we started going out together. ‘We . didn't work in the same office, but on the same floor. I'm . pretty certain it was almost love at first sight, sounds a bit corny, . doesn't it, but there was an instant attraction, that sort of warmth of . her face and the glow that she seemed to give off. ‘And . within a matter of weeks I'd sort of proposed to her and said, ""Well, . you know, why don't we sort of make a go, you know, a proper go of . things and get married?""’ Despite . agreeing to marry after such a brief romance, Chrissie, then aged just 21, . had second thoughts about the union as the wedding day drew near. Chrissie says: ‘I met Tim when I was 21. He was just very, very good-looking and it was just wow, and we were engaged within two weeks. ‘Three weeks before the wedding I turned around to him and said, ""Sorry, don't want to marry you."" ‘To Tim because I said those words, 'I don't want to marry you', he just sort of switched off. 'For me I thought he was just moving out to think and get himself together and that he was going to come back and then we'd have a talk about it, but he never did.’ The couple had no contact for over 20 years after their split, and never discussed the end of the relationship. Tim says it was love at first sight when he first met Chrissie, and he asked her to marry him within a few weeks of dating . Then four years ago Chrissie decided to get back into contact with Tim. ‘I wrote to him and I said: ""Would you want to get in touch so we could just sort of have some closure? Because you just disappeared and there was no closure. For me it just was left hanging for over 20 years,""’ Chrissie says. For Tim, in spite of the relationship's hurtful end, the letter offered a chance to rekindle their special bond. ‘There was this letter in front of me from a person I'd really loved and felt such a great bond with and yet, while things went wrong at the time, there were still those feelings there. Chrissie badly damaged her eye socket in the accident . ‘I actually sat on that letter for about a month thinking about things until I just got to the point where I thought well, what have I got to lose,’ he says. After meeting up the couple decided to make the long-awaited wedding happen. Chrissie says: 'We finally made it down the aisle and it was very special second time round. 'We were older, wiser and much more appreciative of things. 'We got married in jeans and T-shirt with a friend of his from work and his mother, just two witnesses as it was our special moment.' With their love renewed, a besotted Tim hardly left Chrissie's side when she was in King's undergoing treatment for the horrific facial injuries she endured. And when Chrissie was finally well enough to leave King's, Tim was there to help his wife home. Chrissie is still recovering from her injuries and undergoing extensive physiotherapy but hopes to return to work soon. Watch the episode of 24 Hours in A&E here .

A gang member who killed his former schoolfriend by mounting the pavement and driving at him in a stolen car has been jailed for 24 years today. The judge said Kyle Beckford had shown no remorse for the murder of 19-year-old Delaney Brown, who was part of a rival gang. Beckford, 22, had pleaded guilty to manslaughter but a jury at Luton Crown Court found him guilty of murder. Kyle Beckford, left, has been jailed for 24 years for murdering former schoolfriend Delaney Brown, right . Beckford rammed a stolen BMW into Mr Brown, as he rode along the pavement and sent him hurtling into a brick gate post where the force broke his neck. He died within moments of being hit on September 5, last year. The pair had been friends while pupils at Denbigh High School in Luton but later became part of rival gangs. Mr Brown was a member of the Lewsey Farm Gang, sometimes known as The Trap Gang, while Beckford was a member of the Marsh Farm Gang. Judge Richard Foster told Beckford there was 'no excuse' for gang culture in Luton. He said: 'You showed a . complete lack of remorse. Any tears are for the position you now find . yourself in and not for the death of Delaney Brown.' The judge added: 'There can be no excuse for the men of this town to live in this gang culture.' The court heard Mr Brown had been cycling along the pavement in Vincent Road on a stolen bike when Beckford spotted him. Witnesses said Beckford was in the car with other people but refused to name any of them in court. Flowers and empty bottles of alcohol were left on the pavement where Mr Brown was hit from behind and died . Stuart Trimmer QC prosecuting said: 'He . deliberately rammed the bike with sufficient force to lock the two . together, deforming the rear wheel of the bike and propelling the body . of Delaney Brown forward with considerable force.' He added: 'This was a deliberate murder. The weapon . chosen was the car. The method of use of that weapon demonstrates the . deliberate nature of the murder.' Judge Foster said Mr Brown's gang had shown 'disrespect' weeks before his death at the funeral of Beckford's grandfather. He told Beckford: 'You were determined to give the Lewsey Farm Gang a lesson. You were anxious to exert your supremacy.' The . judge said he could not be sure Beckford had been 'hunting' for Delaney . Brown on the day he died as the prosecution suggested. 'But when you . saw him alone and on his bicycle, you took your opportunity. If it had . not been then, it would have been another time,' he said. He said Mr Brown had pedalled furiously in an attempt to get away, but Beckford had . driven after him and mounted the pavement as he got closer. 'Delaney Brown must have been petrified in those last few seconds of his life,' he said. Beckford was rammed a stolen BMW into the Mr Brown's bike and the crash broke the victim's neck . Judge Foster also paid tribute to witnesses who had given evidence at the trial, albeit anonymously. Both Mr Brown and Beckford had appeared in YouTube videos for their respective gangs and in the weeks leading up to Mr Brown's death there had been a number of 'violent incidents between these groups'. Mr Brown's home, where he lived with his grandmother Doreen Taylor, had been targeted by the Marsh Farm gang months earlier and the kitchen window had been smashed the front door damaged. On another the police were called after the two gangs clashed with machetes. Stuart Trimmer QC prosecuting told the court gang members and their parents had previously held a meeting to try and calm the situation. In the witness box Beckford denied 'hunting down' Delaney saying he had only wanted to scare him. He said suspected he had been involved in an 'ambush' of his cousin by a group of young men from Hockwell Ring some weeks before. He said: 'He was involved and he was telling me he wasn't. I didn't want to kill him or seriously harm him. He was my friend.' Beckford had earlier pleaded guilty during the trial to the manslaughter of his former school friend but the jury found him guilty of murder.","Kyle Beckford rammed the back of Delaney Brown's bike in Luton .

Murdered: Juliana Redding, 21, had just posed for Maxim magazine and was preparing for her acting career to skyrocket in 2008 . It is a murder mystery straight out of Hollywood - a young actress and model strangled to death allegedly by the female enforcer of a shady businessman and physician who has fled the country. This Monday, jury selection will begin in the long awaited murder trial of Kelly Soo Park, 47, who prosecutors in Southern California accuse of killing Juliana Redding, 21, with her bare hands in March 2008. Prosecutors say that Park worked as a paid 'enforcer' for a Dr. Munir Uwaydah, who sent her to 'intimidate and threaten' the aspiring actress at her Santa Monica apartment after a business dispute involving her father. Redding, originally from Tucson, Arizona, appeared in low-budget films and also modeled for Maxim magazine and was found beaten to death in her home over five years ago, according to Los Angeles County District Attorney Office records. Initial reports at the time described a desperate struggle during which Redding had managed to dial 911 for help when her killer apparently grabbed the phone and hung up. During the investigation, prosecutors discovered that Uwaydah had previously dated Redding and was also in the midst of planning to open a pharmaceutical business with her father, Greg Redding. However, the plans for this fell apart five days before Juliana's death according to the Los Angeles Times because Redding doubted his business partners legitimacy. Prosecutors allege that Uwaydah dispatched Park to Juliana and in turn her father into changing his mind about their planned venture. While Uwaydah has since left the United States following Redding's death, he has not been charged in the murder. Prosecutors allege though, that Park had worked as a 'debt collector' for the spinal surgeon and California businessman on at least two occasions. Scroll Down for Video . 'Hired muscle': Prosecutors say Dr Munir Uwaydah (left) had hired Kelly Soo Park (pictured right) to intimidate and harass his enemies -- and also sent her after Juliana . Kelly Soo Park, 47, is accused of killing an aspiring actress and model in 2008 on orders of a wealthy California doctor and businessman . The doctor referred to Park as being like 'James Bond,' according to court documents - Park currently remains free on $3.5 million bail . According to documents seen by the Los Angeles Times, Park was officially employed as Uwaydah's real estate broker, but was paid hundreds of thousands of extra dollars to collect debts for him. The records show that Park received a $250,000 payment from Uwaydah just weeks before Redding was killed . For years, authorities have alleged that Julaiana, who was dated Dr Uwaydah, was murdered after Park was hired by the doctor to intimidate her . Uwaydah now lives in Lebanon and is not sought in connection with the murder of Redding. A court motion filed last year says that prosecutors are 'not seeking to prove that [Park] murdered Ms. Redding at the direction of Dr. Uwaydah,' only that he told Park to intimidate and threaten the young actress. Investigators in the case have said . that Park has been linked to the crime by DNA evidence found on . Redding's neck, however, defense attorney's argue that the real killer . is Redding's boyfriend at the time of her death, John Gilmore. Gilmore . was cleared as a suspect in the immediate aftermath of the murder, . insisting that he had several people who could offer him an alibi according to CBS News. 'They're . trying to point the finger at Gilmore, saying he had, at one time, . allegedly assaulted his ex-girlfriend,' ABC News legal analyst Dana Cole . said.

A woman lost an incredible 10 stone to become a fitness instructor after being horrendous holiday photographs inspired her to take part in television show The Biggest Loser. Claire Winter, 39, dropped from 24st to 17st 7lbs while on the weight loss show. Since filming ceased she has managed to lose a further 3st 7lbs and now weighs in at 14 stone. Her stint on the show inspired her to become a fitness instructor and she now helps others to shed the pounds. Claire Winter dropped 10 stone from 24 stone (left) to 14 stone (right) after taking part in the Biggest Loser and being inspired to become a fitness instructor . Claire decided to take part in the Biggest Loser following a holiday to South America with her ex-husband. The disastrous trip - which XXXXX - made her realise she needed to tackle her weight, and she plucked up courage to apply for the show. Claire had never been comfortable with her size, having gained weight steadily throughout her teens. But the most rapid weight gain happened when she went to university. Claire's weight reached 24 stone and began to impede on her life, preventing her from participating in activities and causing her embarressment . With constant yo-yo diets causing fluctuations of up to a stone or more throughout her life, her weight steadily crept up to 24st. Though she aware her weight was too high, it was a holiday to South America that brought the issue home. Claire said: 'Rather than one defining moment, there were a number of things that pushed me to lose weight. I went travelling round South America with my, now, ex-husband, and a number of things about the trip affected me. Claire was unhappy with her weight but felt she couldn't control it. Now she has a new lease of life . Claire was inspired to become a fitness instructor and now helps others to lose weight and get fit . 'Firstly, clothing was an issue. It was really hard to buy some necessary items, such as waterproof trousers, in my size and, when packing, my clothes took up more space which made packing lightly impossible. 'On the trip itself, my weight impacted what I could to. Whilst trekking in Patagonia I was unable to take part in all of the walks; having to do the shorter options or, in some cases, completely miss out as it was too much for me. 'I felt very conscious of my size on the flights, especially when asking for seatbelt extenders. Flying with my then-husband made me feel a bit better as I could take up some of his space but, when I flew alone between Ecuador and Rio, I ended up sat between a couple of larger gentleman and it was very uncomfortable for all of us. Claire says the problems her weight caused while she was traveling in South America inspired her to apply for The Biggest Loser . 'Little things, individually, built up - things in everyday life that made me feel uncomfortable, both emotionally and physically, and made me want to change.' In 2011, Claire found herself walking up to the Biggest Loser house with her sister-in-law Sara. Claire battled on the show to became the female with the biggest percentage weight loss, managing to lose in total 6st 6lbs. After the show, Claire pursued her new found passion for exercise, finding that participating in exercise classes kept her motivation high. Claire, seen here with another contestant, became the female winner on The Biggest Loser, with the largest percentage weight loss, losing a whopping 6 stone 6 lbs . Claire said: 'The energy and enthusiasm of the instructors always lifted me to work harder however tired I was and regardless of how much time I had spent working out that day or week.' Inspired by the classes by fitness brand Les Mills, Claire decided to become a fitness instructor: 'I decided to train in my favourite class: Bodycombat. 'I found that I could get rid of all of my frustrations and lose myself in the class, punching and kicking to the music. I would always come out smiling, knowing I'd worked hard, so I decided to start teaching.' Claire says she loves inspiring others to losing weigh but doesn't believe in punishing yourself . Claire is now a qualified fitness instructor and personal trainer, and she has shed over 10st in total. Claire says that her weight loss and new fitness has totally transformed her life: 'I teach classes in a number of centres, work in a gym and am a personal trainer to people in their own homes. I have so much more confidence now that I am fit and strong. 'Knowing that I am physically capable of so much translates into added mental confidence which transfers into everything I do. 'My family have also noticed that I am happier, confident, and have loads more energy.' Claire also loves that she inspires others to lose weight, and advises people to to make the lifestyle changes to improve their quality of life. 'I know that my weight loss has inspired lots of people to lose weight and get fit. 'People that have followed my journey on the show and people that have seen me working out in the gym and changing shape over the last couple of years have seen what I've done and know that change is achievable. 'In my opinion you can make it hard for yourself or you can make it easy, it's a question of how you approach it. 'The key thing is to remember you always have a choice; you can eat what you want and you can do as much or as little, as you want - but you need to accept the consequences of that decision. 'The best thing is to find what works for you: there is no magic answer for everyone. 'Find exercise you enjoy, change a couple of things at a time and, most importantly, enjoy the journey. 'It's not about punishing yourself, it's about treating yourself well - enjoying learning what your body is capable of and how much better you feel when you eat healthily and exercise. 'Don't obsess over a number on the scales as it can be affected by so many factors. 'Instead, concentrate on how you feel, and look at your clothing size or measurements. 'Of course, people told me these things before my journey, and I had to go through the process to discover it for myself. 'The best thing you can do is start making changes now. Don't wait until tomorrow, or Monday.' Claire Winter is a LES MILLS™ fitness instructor. LES MILLS™ has just launched the explosive, fat-burning 30-minute workout: GRIT™Series.

Tanning mom Sarah Willman admits she is scared of getting cancer but still uses sun beds for at least 20 minutes a day, five days a week. Despite her own addiction, Mrs Willman said she does not want her daughter Bridget, nine, to ever use sun beds. Scroll down for video . Tanning mom Sarah Willman, with children Bridget and Malachi, tans for 20 minutes, five days a week . The part-time model is scared of getting cancer but can't quit tanning because she loves the 'Barbie look' The tanorexic, pictured, used to wake at 4am to get her sun bed fix before her children even woke up . The 30-year-old was nicknamed 'Malibu Barbie' at beauty college and continues to maintain her bronzed image - that she has had since she was 14 - even though she realises it is dangerous. While she was a young mom going to beauty . college, she used to go to two different tanning salons so she could . tan for 40 minutes a day. Mrs Willman said she becomes jittery and upset if she cannot get a tanning fix and regularly sneaks of to the salon in her lunch break. She has even got up at 4am before waking Bridget and six-year-old son Malachi so she could go tanning . Now she regularly goes in the evenings without telling husband Andrew Eppler, 27, an oil rig worker. Mrs Willman, from Dickinson, North Dakota, said: 'There's times when, if the tanning salon was open at 11pm at night, I'd be there. 'In another town where I lived in, where I went to college, it opened up at 5am and I would go before college. 'Then I got memberships at two tanning salons - because they never knew.' Husband Andrew said his wife will sneak off to the salon and will not answer her phone or text messages . Mrs Willman (pictured modeling, left, and aged five, right) said she started tanning when she was just 14 because of low self-esteem and now loves the fake Barbie look with her peroxide hair and permanent tan . The mother-of-two said her Barbie image had helped her get booked on photo-shoots . Now the office worker even uses self-tanning lotion and bronzer on top of her sun-bed tan because she feels she is not brown enough. 'I put fake tanner on top of my normal tan in case there's spots I didn't get. You can't always get tanned in certain areas, it's just impossible,' she said. Her obsession with tanning began when she suffered from low self esteem as a teenager, and spent time on tanning and her appearance to boost her confidence. 'I starting using sun beds when I was 14, but I tanned a lot more when I was 16 or 17, as it was easier to sneak away from my parents,' she admitted. 'I felt like I needed to be this perfect, skinny tan girl. I was trying to fit in and be cool and popular.' She added: 'Before I had kids I probably spent about $500 a month on clothes because it was so important to me to look good all the time.' Mrs Willman's peroxide blonde hair, tanned appearance and 'Barbie-girl' style, helped her gain part time work as model, even going to photo-shoots in New York and Las Vegas. 'I've had some crazy opportunities, but I can't always go on the shoots because I have a family,' she said. Mrs Willman's mother is worried about her addiction but she says she has tried to stop before and failed . Mrs Willman said she is determined to quit 'before it's too late because I want to be there for my kids' But now, she is starting to worry about the effects of using sun beds on her health and is warning others not to make the same mistakes. 'I think my mom worries, because if I were my mom, and if it was my daughter, I wouldn't be happy with it,' she said. 'I do not want me daughter tanning. I don't my children to ever step in a tanning bed.' She is too afraid to see a skin care expert for fear they might find evidence of sun damage - but insists she will quit in the future. 'I can't quit, I've tried. But I'm going to try again. I'm scared of getting cancer,' she said. 'I want to quit before it's too late because I want to be there for my kids.' Husband Andrew added: 'Sarah's beautiful the way she is and she doesn't need to tan. 'When she's getting off work and sneaking to the tanning booth and not telling me where she's at, won't answer her phone or text messages, it's like this is borderline addiction therapy needed.' Leading dermatologist Doris Day, from Day Dermatology and Aesthetics in New York, said: 'For some people with tanorexia - it could be a form of obsessive compulsive disorder or even depression and treating for those conditions may help break the habit of tanning.' Last year, the original Tanning Mom, Patricia Krentcil, from New Jersey, hit the headlines when she was arrested for allegedly taking her five-year-old daughter, Anna, into a tanning booth.

Delia Smith has condemned TV programmes such as MasterChef for intimidating aspiring cooks  and says the nation has lost its grip on home cooking. The woman who has encouraged millions to serve up simple family recipes for more than four decades said few celebrity chefs actually showed people the basics, such as ‘how to make an omelette’. Asked whether she worried that shows such as MasterChef, the hit BBC1 series presented by John Torode and Greg Wallace, intimidated rather than inspired, she replied: ‘Yes, I would never be a judge on that. 'They used to ask me but I could never criticise people: my job is to make them feel they can do it.’ She did, however, express admiration for shows such as The Hairy Bikers on BBC2. ‘They make it funny and yet they make you think, “I’d like to make that”. That’s very clever,’ she said. The 71-year-old cook and author believes today’s food programmes aim to entertain more than they educate. ‘Food isn’t theatre and to make it into theatre is wrong,’ she told the Radio Times. ‘It can speak for itself and it’s wonderful and it’s beautiful and it’s art – it’s everything. ‘I don’t think it needs that kind of embellishment. Our problem is we don’t think highly enough of it, and so we think we’ve got to wrap it up in all kinds of other things.’ She added: ‘We’ve lost our grip on home cooking. I can see that by the way kitchen equipment shops are in decline. There are a lot of short cuts but the main problem is that people are afraid to cook.’ Author claims MasterChef, hosted by Gregg Wallace and John Torode, intimidates rather than inspires viewers . Miss Smith, who remains Britain’s top cookery author, selling 21 million books, recently announced her retirement from TV. She has now started an online cookery school, providing free step-by-step videos and promoting the message that cooking is something we all should be able to do. ‘Everybody now knows about food from around the world and what chefs do; but not everybody knows how to make an omelette,’ she said. ‘What is missing is the basics. There’s where I come in ... that’s what I want to try and do: fill that gap.’ Miss Smith recalled filming her first TV series, Family Fare, in 1973 in a tiny studio. ‘The nearest running water was the ladies’ loo so we used to fill two buckets with water – one with soap, one for rinsing – and have them under the counter where I worked,’ she said. ‘They didn’t have the money for editing so I had to do 25 minutes 40 seconds all in one go; if I made a mistake I had to start at the top. ‘And they didn’t do any close-ups because my hands were shaking too much.’ Asked whether she would turn down the BBC if the broadcaster approached her to work for the corporation again, she said: ‘I’d say, “I’ll sell you what I’m doing. You can buy it and broadcast it in a five-minute slot”. Why not?’","Says show intimidates rather than educates viewers on cooking .

New mothers should be interviewed three to four months after they give birth to check they are bonding with their babies, according to a Government-commissioned report. At the moment, midwives and health visitors usually check on new mothers for up to six weeks after their delivery. But after that they face several months without a formal appraisal of how they are coping with motherhood. New mothers should be interviewed three to four months after they give birth to check they are bonding with their babies, according to a Government-commissioned report . Child abuse charity The Wave Trust, . which carried out the research, said failing to check for post-natal . depression, domestic violence or alcoholism at this stage can have a . long-lasting impact on the child. They found babies who formed poor relationships with their mothers were more likely to become aggressive and break the law when they got older. And they said the 15 per cent of children who suffer neglect or violence at the hands of their parents are responsible for nearly three-quarters of disruptive behaviour among children. The report was commissioned by the Department for Education and supported by the Department of Health. The findings have also been endorsed by Children¿s Minister Elizabeth Truss . It also suggests adding two more assessment interviews – one during pregnancy and the other when the child is 12 to 15 months old. Wave Trust chief executive George Hosking said: ‘This report, if adopted fully, could contribute to transforming the quality of childhood in this country.’ The Royal College of Midwives has welcomed the study’s recommendations. Chief executive Professor Cathy Warwick said: ‘It makes good sense, particularly in the climate just now when a lot of women aren’t having continuity of care from health professionals. ‘We want to help that situation because it leads to a lot of women falling through the cracks.’ The findings have also been endorsed by Children’s Minister Elizabeth Truss, who said: ‘As our understanding of the brain development of babies continues, so too must our policies.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘We will carefully consider all the recommendations in this report.’","Midwives and health visitors check on new mothers for up to six weeks .

We're also planning to buy a farm and I'm going to . become a French female farmer in the not too distant future.' But before realising her agricultural dreams, Samantha has her new book, Head Over Heels In France, to finish promoting. Love: Head Over Heels In France is for people who want a love story or who are curious about French life . First: Samantha says that husband Pascal is now her top priority while work has been pushed down the list . The book, which tells the story of her first year on the opposite side of the Channel reveals how she fell in love with carpenter husband Pascal and how she coped with transitioning from high flying TV executive to French housewife. 'The reason I wrote Head over Heels in France is because at the age of 36 in 2007, the biggest thing that ever happened to me in my life occurred in that I fell in love with a Frenchman,' she explains. 'A camouflage-wearing, gitane-smoking muscly macho macho carpenter - in other words, the complete opposite of me. 'I fell head over heels in love and so I moved to France where I didn't even speak the language, and I just made this life-changing decision on a whim and for 12 months of my life, every day I woke up to something new and to something different and it was extraordinary. 'Head Over Heels In France is going to be read, I hope, by anyone who is attracted to a love story. It's also for those people who are fascinated by and curious about what life in France is really like. If I can do it then anyone can do it and that's the message I really hope people take away from the book.'","Husband Pascal and stepson Antonio are now her top priorities .

The only official Government report into future Romanian and Bulgarian migration into Britain has been branded a ‘whitewash’ – after it failed to answer the key question of how many would arrive next year. From January 1, EU controls on workers from the two countries will expire, allowing almost 29million people free access to work here. Following repeated refusals by ministers to estimate how many will come, the £30,000 Foreign Office-commissioned study said it was ‘not possible to predict the scale of future migration’ from the two EU countries. The MigrationWatch think-tank has predicted about 50,000 Romanian and Bulgarian migrants could come here every year from next year . However, the report did warn an influx could lead to pressure on already scarce primary school places, and of high levels of diseases such as measles among Romanian nationals. The lack of estimate provoked ridicule from commentators and backbench Tory MPs. The MigrationWatch think-tank has predicted about 50,000 Romanian and Bulgarian migrants could come here every year from next year. Chairman Sir Andrew Green said: ‘This report is a bucket of whitewash. In 60 pages it provides no estimate whatever. It doesn’t even address the only estimate published so far, by MigrationWatch.’ ‘It brushes aside any indication of an increase in migration from these countries.’ General view of the estate in Germany, where up to 400 Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants have moved in since last February . Experts say the lack of any firm . estimate makes it impossible to prepare for the extra pressure new . arrivals could put on public services. They also fear the most . significant disruption could be felt in the jobs market. The report, by the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, was published today despite officials receiving it ‘in draft’ as early as December last year. It blamed lack of ‘current data’ on how many migrants are here, and said there was ‘no agreed definition’ of what migration was. It said: ‘Estimates of potential migration to the UK are likely to be inaccurate and misleading and our report does not include these.’ It suggested Romanians and Bulgarians will migrate to Spain and Italy – despite much higher unemployment levels there. It said: ‘Survey evidence suggests the UK is not a strongly favoured location.’ The report did warn that families arriving with children could ‘potentially increase pressure’ on primary school places, and are likely to claim child benefit and other  in-work benefits such as tax credits. It pointed to high levels of measles, mumps and rubella among Romanian nationals and high rates of tuberculosis. And it said there could be ‘added pressure’ on housing. Those who come are likely to be under 35 and working in low-skilled jobs, it said. According to a British Labour Force survey, there are 26,000 Bulgarians and 80,000 Romanians already living in the UK. Last month, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles admitted the Government had ‘no idea’ about the size of the possible influx. Tory MP Philip Hollobone said: ‘I think they have avoided answering that question because the numbers are likely to be huge.’","From January 1 controls on workers from Romania and Bulgaria will expire .

'Bad mother': Courtney Addington, 24, was arrested and charged with murder for allegedly leaving her newborn baby to die in a trash bag in January . A 24-year-ld California woman has been arrested after police say she killed her newborn baby and then attempted to cover up the crime by feigning an illness. Courtney Addington, of Sacramento, was taken into custody Tuesday morning in connection to the death of her baby in January. The 24-year-old has been charged with murder following a three-month investigation and was ordered held without bail at the Sacramento County Main Jail, CBS Sacramento reported. Addington was admitted to Mercy General Hospital on January 25 suffering from uncontrollable vaginal bleeding. A medical examination and a pregnancy test soon revealed that she had recently given birth, but the patient insisted that her bleeding was caused by irritable bowel syndrome, according to court documents cited by Sacramento Bee. Hospital staff became suspicious and notified police. Deputies were dispatched to Addington's home in the 3800 block of Wildrose Way, where they found the lifeless body of a newborn wrapped in a white garbage bag and stashed under a bed with the placenta and umbilical cord still attached. In another bag, law enforcement officials discovered bloody towels. Home delivery: Police say Addington gave birth at home in the 3800 block of Wildrose Way, Sacramento, and then asked an unsuspecting relative to take her to a hospital . Failed ruse: Addington was admitted to Mercy General Hospital with severe bleeding, which she blamed on irritable bowel syndrome even though tests showed that she had recently given birth . The baby was identified in the criminal complaint as Hayden Elaine. Deputies allege that Addington had caused the child's death, although it has not been determined how the infant died. Autopsy performed on the baby only indicated that the child was born alive and breathed after delivery. ‘Everything points to the fact she put the baby in the bag,’ Sheriff's Sgt. Jason Ramos said. According to her Facebook page, Addington, a native of Antelope, went to California State University, Chico, and later studied performing Arts at American River College. Child abuse detective Janae Galovich wrote in a request for an arrest warrant that Addington's boyfriend - who was the father of the baby - as well as her family 'all suspected she was pregnant due to her growing stomach and wearing baggy clothing.' Whenever confronted about her changing body, Addington would deny pregnancy and attribute it to her IBS. But . when interviewed by detectives, the 24-year-old's doctor said that . Addington had never been diagnosed with the condition, and had never . been prescribed medication for it. Horrific crime: Detectives say Addington stuffed her newborn into a trash bag and stashed it under a bed with the umbilical cord and placenta still attached . Web of lies: Addington's boyfriend and relatives noticed that she was gaining weight and wearing baggy clothes to cover her stomach, but the woman repeatedly denied pregnancy and blamed the changes on IBS . During the three-month investigation, officials conducted a forensic review of Addington's cell phone, which revealed that just days before the delivery, the woman searched online for ‘IBS medications’; ‘Signs of water breaking?’ and ‘How to stop loss of blood.’ Sgt Ramos said it is believed that Addington gave birth on her own at home and then asked an unsuspecting family member to drive her to the hospital. Officials pointed out that California has a Safely Surrender Baby Law that allows women to leave a newborn in a hospital or a fire station within 72 hours of delivery without retribution.","Police say Courtney Addington gave birth alone in her home in January and then had a relative drive her to a hospital .

Miss Meagher said that in the hours following the blasts she feared that her father, a finish line official, was also among the casualties. 'At the time, my world was collapsing because my dad was at the finish line and I was just coming round [to the final straight] and I heard this big explosion,' she told Fox News. 'I was just underneath the media bridge and I just saw everyone evacuating and going into panic and then the second bomb went off. It was even more scary and I just started to run.' She told how she knocked over barriers marking the course and into the street, where police intercepted her and escorted her to safety. It was then that a bystander rushed to her aid, as seen in the images which have spread across America. Fears: Miss Meagher, right, with her sister Katy, who also ran in the marathon but was behind her when the bombs exploded. Their father, Tom, was unhurt in the blasts and also rushed to help others . 'That scene was just me panicking,' Miss Meagher recalled. She told of her gratitude to the stranger who helped her. 'He was with me all afternoon. I was so panicked,' she said. 'His name is Anthony and [he and] his brother-in-law, they helped me through because at the time I didn't know where my family was.' In the hours following the blast, the men never left her side, letting her use their cellphone to track down the rest of her family and make sure they were okay. Miss Meagher's father, Tom, a finish-line coordinator, was unhurt and had himself rushed to the aid of runners injured and traumatized by the explosions.

Detectives are now investigating the possibility that this bag contained the device that exploded with such devastating effect. Another photograph from the scene of the terror attacks shows a shredded black, padded back-pack or duffel bag that would confirm numerous reports that the bomb was carried in a black bag.

Jade Bayliss was off school with illness when her mother's ex-boyfriend burgled the home, strangled her, and set the house alight . A convicted killer has been found guilty of murdering a 13-year-old British schoolgirl in New Zealand. Jade Bayliss was strangled with an electrical cord by her mother's former boyfriend Jeremy McLaughlin before he set the family home ablaze to cover up the crime. McLaughlin, a 35-year-old labourer, was found guilty of her murder this week as it emerged that he had previously been freed early from jail for killing a 14-year-old boy in Australia. Jade, from Seascale in Cumbria, moved . to New Zealand in 2006 with her parents Gary Bayliss and Tina Lawson, . sister Amber and brother Harvey. She . was off school with illness when McLaughlin arrived at the house to . burgle the family's home in Christchurch on the country's South Island . in November 2011. His brief relationship with Ms Lawson, who shouted 'You b******' as the verdict was delivered, had ended a fortnight before. He stole items from the house, pawning some and dumping others, before returning with petrol to set the house on fire. McLaughlin . strangled Jade in her bedroom because she had seen him entering the . house, the High Court in Christchurch heard. Her body did not show any . fire-related injuries. Ms Lawson, 34, said she approached police four days before her . daughter's death because she was concerned about McLaughlin's behaviour in the wake of their split. He had turned . up unannounced at her home many times after they had split up about a . fortnight earlier. 'He's a big guy and I just feared something possibly could happen,' she said she told police. Jade Bayliss moved to New Zealand in 2006 with her family. In November 2011, her mother's ex-boyfriend Jeremy McLaughlin strangled her to death and set the family home alight after burgling the house . She . asked them what she could do to stop it 'turning into something else' and was given trespass papers to serve against McLaughlin if . he turned up at her home. Ms Lawson, who separated from Mr Bayliss in 2008, was not made aware of her ex-boyfriend's previous . convictions. 'If they could have told me I wouldn't have left her at . home. I possibly would have been at home with her,' she said. McLaughlin denied murder but admitted burgling and setting fire to the house. His flatmate Jolon Sweeney, 42, admitted a charge of being an accessory. After the trial, Jade's parents paid tribute to their 'beautiful' daughter, who was 'shy and social' with a close group of friends. Ms Lawson said: 'Jade is a great loss to our family. This verdict will not change the fact that she is no longer with us. This is something we have been trying to come to terms with for the last 17 months. 'Jade was a bright, beautiful, bubbly girl, kind and loving and this is how we will remember her. 'We all love her very much and we miss her every day.' Mr Bayliss said: 'There are no words to fully express how terrible the last 17 months have been. 'With this behind us, we want to remember Jade for the gentle, caring, funny and loving girl she was; not for what happened to her that terrible day. 'She loved her family and we loved her back - we miss her every single day.' After the verdict, reporting restrictions were lifted to reveal that McLaughlin had been convicted of killing Phillip Vidot, in Perth, Australia, in November 1995. Philip, 14, and his friend Tyron Williams had gone shopping but were battered with a cricket bat, run over by a car and then robbed. Philip died hours later while Williams was in a coma for eight days and left brain damaged. McLaughlin, who was 17 at the time, admitted wielding the cricket bat while an accomplice admitted running over the pair. A jury acquitted them of murder, but found them guilty of manslaughter. They were sentenced to 12 years in jail. McLaughlin served six years in jail before he was deported to New Zealand in 2001. He will be sentenced for Jade's murder on June 13.","Jade Bayliss, from Cumbria, was murdered by Jeremy McLaughlin in 2011 .

Jailed: Sarah Hallcup has been sentenced to two years in prison for conspiracy to commit burglary . A trusted nanny who worked for the Duke of Wellington’s youngest son was jailed yesterday for helping her lover ransack his country home. Sarah Hallcup was treated as part  of the family by Lord Christopher Wellesley, 48, and his wife Emma. They were so close that Lady Wellesley, 36, became godmother to unmarried Hallcup’s 19-month-old son. But while the Wellesleys and their three children were on holiday, she helped her boyfriend steal heirlooms worth £30,000 from Top Hill House, the family’s  £1million three-storey mansion in Heckfield, Hampshire, a court heard. The haul taken by Hallcup, 28, and Neal Akhtar, 27, included paintings, a Cartier clock, a pair of silver pheasants worth £250 and busts of Lord Wellesley’s  famous ancestor, the first Duke of  Wellington, who defeated Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815. The pair also ransacked the small one-bedroom annexe where Hallcup lived in an attempt to make it look like a break-in. But detectives became suspicious when they could find no sign of a forced entry and Hallcup, who had worked for the family for four years, showed no  concern about the burglary. Akhtar was arrested after his fingerprints were found in the house. Officers discovered pictures of the haul on his mobile phone and camera, as well as records of contact with antiques dealers about selling some of the goods. Hallcup was arrested after admitting she and Akhtar were in a relationship. Police discovered texts between the pair about ‘robbing the mansion’ while she had used her phone to carry out an internet search for the value of the clock. Messages from Akhtar’s BlackBerry showed he had offered the stolen goods for sale to antiques dealers and he had also tried to sell some of the haul to his uncle. Many of the items taken, including a Tiffany-style bracelet with the inscription ‘E love M’ belonging to Lady Wellesley, have never been recovered.

A Canyon County man has been arrested after passing himself off as a Disney heir called 'Stephen Disney' and giving away stolen passes to Disneyland. Stephen David Urquidez, 51, is accused of donating stolen passes to the park to a woman who was hosting a charity auction. For the winners of the charity raffle it must have been a dream come true, but when they arrived at the theme park they discovered the passes had not been activated and therefore wouldn't work. False hope: Disneyland passes like these ones were donated to a charity auction, but they had been stolen . Fake identity: Stephen Urquidez allegedly told the charity volunteer his name was Stephen Disney . Authorities believe Urquidez stole the . passes from a supermarket. He was arrested on . suspicion of felony burglary on Tuesday. Urquidez allegedly passed himself off as 'Stephen Disney', when he met a mature student volunteering at a charity. The 40-year-old woman contacted police in January after discovering that the tickets she was given for the non-profit organization were not valid. The student, who met Urquidez at college, told police that he claimed to be an heir of the famous family, saying that was why he had the passes, according to KHTS. Although Urquidez was arrested for burglary and not identity theft, when police arrested him they discovered a driver's license, with a fake state seal, in the name of 'Stephen Disney', and W-2 tax forms showing the Disney name. Heir claims: Stephen Urquidez allegedly said he was related to the Disney family . Denied: Walt Disney's family say Urquidez has no connection to them or the corporation . Walt Disney Corporation confirmed Urquidez was not affiliated with the corporation or the Disney family. Police are now keen to hear from other people who may have fallen for the false identity. In an interview outside his apartment with KCal 9, Urquidez denied using the name, adding: 'Do you think Disney would live here?' 'Somebody lived here before me named . Disney. They’re confusing me with someone else,' he said. 'I’m . Stephen Urquidez. I don’t know Stephen Disney.' Disney regularly gives away tickets for its resorts to charities and non-profit organizations, who must apply online . at least 60 days before the tickets are needed. Make a wish: Disneyland in Anaheim, California, regularly donates tickets to charitable organizations . Walt Disney was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1901, won 22 Academy Awards in his lifetime. He founded the $17 million Anaheim resort in California in 1955. The Orlando Florida resort was still being built at the time of his death in 1966.

The Duchess of Cambridge is an 'unambitious' and 'bland' individual who should be called Britain's 'Queen Wag', according to a leading feminist author. In a blistering attack republican Joan Smith, who has turned down an MBE, says that Kate should be compared to Cheryl Cole and Coleen Rooney and claims she has 'done little' apart from marrying Prince William and falling pregnant. It comes months after best-selling author Hilary Mantel's venomous and upsetting critique of the Duchess, in which she called the 31-year-old royal a 'mannequin' with 'dead eyes'. Attack: In her book The Public Woman, Joan Smith devotes an entire chapter to the Duchess where she calls her an ‘unambitious, uncontroversial and bland' person who married William and 'got pregnant' The Bring Up the Bodies writer also branded her a 'machine-made’ princess, ‘designed by committee’, who went from a ‘jointed doll on which certain rags are hung’ to a woman whose ‘only point and purpose’ was to give birth. Now Ms Smith has devoted a chapter to Kate in her new book The Public Woman, which she has called Queen Wag. ‘By the age of 30, the new Duchess of Cambridge had done little since leaving university except play a supporting role to her boyfriend, marry him with great pomp and ceremony and get pregnant,’ she writes. ‘She had never really enjoyed an independent identity or income — even her clothes were paid for by her father-in-law — and didn’t seem to aspire to either. ‘Unambitious, uncontroversial and bland, Kate Middleton was Queen Wag in everything but name.’ Referring to those who have been branded . Wags, Smith cites Coleen Rooney and Cheryl Cole, then adds of Kate: . ‘It’s all the more telling that the prime candidate, the woman who . arguably deserved the title more than anyone, never appeared on lists of . the country’s leading contenders.’ Comparison: The feminist author, who turned down an MBE, says Kate is like Coleen Rooney and Cheryl Cole . She claims the Duchess has become famous ‘not for her achievements . but her willingness to play the most traditional feminine role of all: . waiting for a husband, getting married and not long afterwards becoming . pregnant’. Ms Smith is best known for writing the Loretta Lawson crime novels, . and her new book is about what she sees as the backlash against gender . equality and its ‘staggering viciousness’. The Reading . University-educated 59-year-old was married to satirist Francis Wheen . for eight years and then had a relationship with disgraced MP Denis . MacShane, who was suspended from the Labour Party for using fake . receipts in his parliamentary expenses and forced to resign his seat. Harsh: In her vicious attack on the Duchess, award winning author Hilary Mantel called her a 'doll to hang rags on' Criticisms: Kate, who married Prince William in 2011, pictured at a wedding earlier this month, is famous for playing a traditional role, not her own achievements, says Ms Smith . The storm of criticism Kate has faced even forced Prime Minister David Cameron, 46, to step in to defend her. 'What I've seen of Princess Kate at public events, at the Olympics and elsewhere, is this is someone who's bright, who's engaging, who's a fantastic ambassador for Britain,' he said. 'We should be proud of that, rather than make these rather misguided remarks.' But a month after Mantel's comments, broadcaster Sandi Toksvig also gave her strong opinion about the Duchess. 'We used to admire women who got their place in life through . marriage and having children,' she said, 'but I like to think we've . grown up a bit. I can't think of a single opinion she holds - it's very . Jane Austen'.","Republican Joan Smith has dedicated a chapter to Kate in her new book .

The wife of deceased former mob-boss John Gotti has been hospitalized after suffering what was reportedly a 'very serious' stroke. It is the third stroke mob matriarch Victoria Gotti has suffered since 2006. Gotti's condition is unknown - she reportedly suffered the stroke last week and her family is requesting privacy in regards to her condition. Gotti and the former Gambino boss were . married in 1962, when the future 'Teflon Don' was just a small-time . street thug. Mafia mom: Victoria Gotti had five children with former mob boss John Gotti . By 1985, John Gotti was running one of the largest criminal . enterprises in the world after organizing the gangland slaying of then . Gambino-boss Paul Castellano outside of a bustling Manhattan steak . house. John and Victoria Gotti had five children - Angel, Victoria, John, Frank and Peter. Frank Gotti was killed on March 18, 1980, when Gotti neighbor John Favara ran the 12-year-old boy over with his car. The incident was ruled an accident, but when Favara visited the Gottis to offer his condolences, Victoria Gotti attacked him with a baseball bat. In July of 1980, Favara was abducted and never heard from again. He was presumed murdered in a hit ordered by Gotti - an allegation John Gotti Jr. has said is 'probable.' 'Teflon': John Gotti ran the Gambino crime family for nearly a decade until a 1992 conviction landed him in prison until his death in 2002 . Of all the Gotti children, John Jr. is the only one to follow his father into a life of crime.

A public housing project that began as the an architectural marvel by the man who would later design the World Trade Center quickly deteriorated into an infamous slum. In twenty years, St. Louis, Missouri’s Pruitt-Igoe crumbled into decrepitude and even now, 40 years after the massive public project was imploded, people are asking why. A 2011 documentary called 'The Pruitt-Igoe Myth,' screening this summer in cities across the country, tells the tale of the hope-filled project’s violent demise. Scroll down for video . Hopeful: St. Louis, Missouri's Pruitt-Igoe housing projects began as a symbol of hope for city planners as well as fed up working class residents of decrepit slums of the day . Hopeless: Just 20 years later, the massive project would be in ruins after crime and filthy conditions forced them to be demolished . Pruitt-Igoe was devised as part of the massive urban renewal projects of the 1950s and 1960s. Previously, . the working class residents of St. Louis had been living in dangerous . squalor with communal bathrooms and unreliable electricity. The . city commissioned what they thought was the solution: a 33-building . modern complex designed by the future architect of the World Trade . Center Minoru Yamasaki. Originally . envisioned as segregated housing—the name Pruitt came from a Tuskegee . airman, while Igoe was a white man—the complex became all-black once . segregation was outlawed and the whites began fleeing the inner city. Big idea: Designed by architect Minoru Yamasaki, who would later build the World Trade Center, Pruitt-Igoe was supposed to be the answer to St. Louis's inner city housing problems . Success: And at first, it was. Working class residents were wowed by their new surroundings and the complex embodied the extensive urban renewal attempts of the 1950s and 1960s . Sleek: Though small, the apartments offered comforts and conveniences many residents had never seen . Pruitt-Igoe opened in 1956 to the . wide-eyed awe of residents accustomed to far less from their housing. Green spaces invited their children to play and clean contemporary décor . made residents feel, according to a woman quoted in the documentary, . like they were in ‘a big hotel resort.’ Marketing . footage from the time of the complex’s opening called it a reprieve . from the ‘crowded, collapsing tenements’ that many of the new residents . had grown up with. Escape: Pruitt-Igoe won residents a reprieve from decrepit St. Louis tenement housing, which had extensive water and electricity problems and trash-filled streets . Stylish: Here was housing that didn't just gleam, it did so in style . Paradise: There were even verdant lawns where children could play . And for the first few years, things . were good at Pruitt-Igoe and the community there thrived as 24-hour . patrols kept watch and maintenance crews kept everything gleaming. But by the 1960, things had taken a turn. Community: For the first few years, an active community flourished around the ambitious housing projects . Model: For a time, the project appeared to be a success and Pruitt-Igoe looked like a model on which the world's cities could base future projects . Occupancy started to drop as crime rose. Lower occupancy meant less rent going to the city to cover the building’s expenses. Which, in turn, meant crime went up as fewer patrols were around to keep order. Changes: But in the 1960s, things started to change. Occupancy rates began to flag but maintenance crews still needed to be paid . Darkening: Vandalism increased and the housing authority even installed special light fixtures that couldn't be broken by kids . Struggle to cope: The city tried to keep up with maintenance and security costs by raising the rents . Evidence: Malfunctioning trash incinerators were never repaired . It also meant nothing got fixed. The once revered project started to decay. The city responded by raising rents and the tenants who remained weren’t able to afford it. They striked in 1969, refusing to pay rent until conditions improved and the city eventually gave in. Backlash: The tenants reacted angrily. They were being charged more and more for progressively worsening housing conditions and held a rent strike . Bitter victory: The city eventually caved to demands for improved conditions, but it was likely too late . Shortly after the 1969 strike, a sewage line broke and flooded units with raw sewage . Gutted: It was the start of a rapid downward spiral . Decline: It was winter and the sewage that poured from 10,000 shattered windows froze in the cold and hung there as a testament to Pruitt-Igoe's failure . But a water main would soon break and . flood many of the buildings and surrounding area with raw sewage. The . whole thing was declared a disaster area. Buildings were quickly abandoned by tenants and began to fill up with drug users, criminals, and the homeless. By 1972, three of the buildings would be demolished. Two years later, the rest would go down, too. 'The Pruitt-Igoe Myth,' by  Chad Friedrichs tells the tale of how the dream of the St. Louis project became a nightmare. Fleeing: The city would soon declare the flooded buildings a disaster area. As tenants left, crime rapidly moved in . History: Three buildings were imploded in 1972. The explosions would be broadcast worldwide and create and enduring and negative image of the once great project . Finished: Two years later, the rest of the buildings would be demolished and Pruitt-Igoe would be no more . Rapid: The 55 acres on which the complex was built were bare again, just 20 years after the hopeful undertaking began .","It was created out of a city's hope and the ingenuity of the same architect who would later design the World Trade Center, but America's most ambitious public housing project went out with bang just 20 years after its 1956 opening ."

Extreme skier Yuichiro Miura conquered the 29,035ft peak at 9am local time Thursday morning, beating his 81-year-old rival, Nepalese Min Bahadur Sherchan, to the top. Mr Miura climbed Mount Everest five years ago, but just missed out on the record when Mr Serchan, a former Gurkha, accomplished the feat aged 76. Scroll down for video . Bold timer: 80-year-old Japanese adventurer Yuichiro Miura, right, pictured with a friend at 6,500 meters, has become the oldest man to reach the top of Mount Everest . He made it: Yuichiro Miura and his team of climbers stand on the summit of Mount Everest on Thursday . Close to the top: Miura calls his support team from the base camp on Wednesday before the last climb . Mr Miura and his son Gota called the support team from the summit to report the news. ‘This is the world's best feeling,’ Mr Miura said. ‘I'm also totally exhausted.’ His rival, Mr Sherchan, is at the base camp on Mount Everest preparing for his own attempt on the summit . next week. On his expedition's website, Miura . explained his attempt to scale Everest at such an advanced age: 'It is . to challenge (my) own ultimate limit. It is to honor the great Mother . Nature.' He said a successful climb would . raise the bar for what is possible, adding: 'If the limit of age 80 is . at the summit of Mt Everest, the highest place on earth, one can never . be happier.' Record breaker: Min Bahadur Sherchan, center, became the oldest person to climb Mount Everest in 2008 . Miura reached the South Col, the . jumping-off point for most final ascents, on Tuesday, according to his . website, which also posted pictures of him eating hand-rolled sushi . inside a tent. Gyanendra Shrestha, a Nepalese mountaineering official at . the base camp, confirmed that he had reached the summit on Thursday morning. Public broadcaster NHK showed footage of Mr Miura's daughter Emili talking with them via speaker phone in Tokyo, clapping when her brother told her they had reached the top. Mr Miura's new record will only last a few days if Sherchan is able to follow him. Miura's daughter, Emili Miura, said . he 'doesn't really care' about the rivalry. 'He's doing it for his own . challenge,' she said. The situation was not too different . five years ago, when, at the age of 75, Miura sought to recapture the . title of oldest man to summit the mountain. He had set the record in . 2003 at age 70, but it was later broken twice by slightly older Japanese . climbers. Yuichiro Miura rests as he goes through the South Col pass, left, and  right, with his son, Gota, on their way to a camp at 8,000 meters (26,247 feet) during his attempt to scale the summit of Mount Everest . Not his first time: Miura, right, takes a break with his son, Gota, on their way to a camp at 6,500 metres . On his way: Miura says the feat, while difficult for a man of any age, will add 70 years to his physical body age - making him feel more like 150 years old . He reached the summit on May 26, . 2008, at the age of 75 years and 227 days, according to Guinness World . Records, however the record eluded him because Sherchan had scaled the . summit the day before, at the age of 76 years and 340 days. His daughter Emili Miura said her father decided to go . ahead with the expedition, despite having had four heart surgeries, because he felt that at . age 80, he was running out of time. Mr Miura fractured his pelvis and left . thigh bone in a 2009 skiing accident, and had an operation in January . for an irregular heartbeat, or arrhythmia, his fourth heart surgery . since 2007, Ms Miura said. Still competitive: Mr Sherchan will start climbing Everest next week to retake his record . On his ascent, Miura made a stop at . the rarely used Camp 5 to take a break between the South Col and the . summit. Almost all the climbers these days walk straight from Camp 4 to . the summit. Mr Miura was well-known long before his late-in-life mountaineering pursuits, as an extreme skier. He . skied down Everest's South Col in 1970, using a parachute to brake his . descent. The feat was captured in the Oscar-winning 1975 documentary, 'The Man Who Skied Down Everest.' In 1964, he briefly set a world speed . skiing record in the Italian Alps, reaching 107 mph. He also skied down Mt. Fuji using parachutes. It wasn't until Miura was 70, . however, that he first climbed all the way to the summit of Everest. When he summited again at 75, he claimed to be the only man to . accomplish the feat twice in his 70s. After that, he said he was . determined to climb again at age 80. Mr Miura was accompanied on the . expedition by his son Gota, 43, a two-time Olympian skier, who also . summited Everest in 2003 with his father. Mr Miura's rival, Mr Sherchan first began mountaineering in 1960 when he climbed . Mount Dhaulagiri, the 8,167-meter (26,790-foot) high peak in Nepal, . according to his grandson, Manoj Guachan. Always an adventurer, and unbowed by age, he walked the length of Nepal in 2003. Sherchan and his team said Wednesday . that they were prepared for their new climb, despite digestive problems . he suffered several days ago. Father and son: Miura has had three heart operations in recent years and suffered a broken pelvis and fractured thigh in a 2009 ski accident . 'Our team leader has just arrived . back at base camp and we are holding a team meeting on when exactly I . will head up to the summit,' Sherchan, who uses a hearing aid, said by . telephone from the base camp. 'I am fine and in good health. I am ready to take up the challenge. Our plan is to reach the summit within one week.' It takes three to four days for climbers to reach Camp 4 on South Col from base camp, and another day to reach the summit. There are only a few windows of good . weather during the climbing season in May for people to attempt the . summit. Sherchan's team is also facing . financial difficulties.

A California couple who prosecutors say kept a 12-year-old relative as a sex slave and a forced laborer have been sentenced to 20 or more years in prison. Inez Martinez Garcia, 43, and Marcial Garcia Hernandez, 45, of San Diego both pleaded guilty to their crimes on Monday following emotional testimony by their victim who hopes that after 12 years she can finally move on. 'I was a young girl, and the things Inez and Marcial did to me have marked me for life. They took away my childhood,' the woman only identified as Isabel wrote in a statement read by prosecutor David Uyar, UT San Diego reports. Sentenced: (from left) Inez Martinez Garcia, 43, and Marcial Garcia Hernandez, 45, were sentenced to 20 or more years in prison on felony charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child and lewd act on a child . 'Today I can go out and be a mother, a wife, and I can sleep knowing that justice has been done,' the now 24-year-old said. Following the reading the couple both pleaded guilty to felony charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child and lewd act on a child. Hernandez was sentenced to 23 years to life and Martinez Garcia 20 years behind bars. Prosecutors said that in mid 2001 the couple helped smuggle the then-12-year-old girl into the U.S. from Mexico. They promised her family there that she'd have a better life. Instead, they forced her to work as their maid and nanny and forced her to have sex with Hernandez and others. In addition to her work at home she was also sent to work in a restaurant with those wages taken by the couple. House of horrors: The 12-year-old girl was illegally smuggled into the U.S. and resided with the couple in this San Diego home for eight months after her family was promised she'd have a good life and be taken care of . When she didn't do as instructed, they beat and burned her, and forced her to eat chili peppers and spoiled food. This abusive behavior ran the course of approximately 18 months, prosecutors said. It finally ended for her when she called 911 over a particularly hard beating by Martinez Garcia. Authorities consequently sent her back to her family in Mexico. Seven years later, now as an adult, the victim returned to the U.S. in recent years but she began having flashbacks to the horrors she experienced. At the recommendation of friends she called police, capping a two-and-a-half-year investigation into the couple by the sheriff's department last December. The couple face deportation back to Mexico where they have green cards from after serving out their sentencing.","Inez Martinez Garcia, 43, and Marcial Garcia Hernandez, 45, pleaded guilty to felony charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child and lewd act on a child .

Sathwik Karnik and his entire family love geography, which could explain how the seventh-grader from Massachusetts was able to come out on top at the National Geographic Bee Wednesday. When he was about 6, his mother began challenging Sathwik and his older brother, Karthik, to her own version of hide-and-seek — using an atlas. The boys would comb through the book, trying to be the first to find a city or landmark. Scroll down for Sathwik Karnik's video . Prodigy: National Geographic Bee winner Sathwik Karnik, left, of Massachusetts gives a thumbs-up as he correctly answers the final question posed by moderator Alex Trebek (center) in Washington . The games paid off when Karthik, now 15, made the finals of the National Geographic Bee in 2011 and 2012. But it was 12-year-old Sathwik, of Plainville, Mass., who finished the job, calmly answering questions about obscure island chains, bodies of water, global trade and culture to win the 25th annual geography bee. The clinching question? ‘Because Earth bulges at the equator, the point that is farthest from Earth's center is the summit of a peak in Ecuador. Name this peak.’ Sathwik nailed it: Chimborazo. Runner-up Conrad Oberhaus, 13, of Lincolnshire, Ill., knew the answer as well, but Sathwik got all five questions right in their one-on-one duel. Earlier, Conrad couldn't name Baotou as the largest city in China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which is home to one of the world's largest deposits of rare-earth elements. While Conrad didn't stumble again, Sathwik never relinquished the lead. Sathwik and his brother said the victory was a team effort. ‘It feels like I just finished something that he wanted to finish, so I sort of in a way completed his unfinished business,’ said Sathwik, who stands 4-foot-11 and has the fuzzy outline of a mustache on his upper lip. Said Karthik: ‘I'm kind of elated now. What we started so many years ago has finally paid off.’ Question: What is the largest city in China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which is home to one of the world's largest deposits of rare-earth elements?Answer: Baotou . Winning question: Because the earth bulges at the equator, which mountain peak on the earth is farthest from the earth’s center?Answer: Chimborazo . Sathwik might have made it to the finals earlier if not for Karthik, who beat him twice in the Massachusetts state bee. But the younger brother triumphed at their school bee three years ago when he was in fourth grade and Karthik was in sixth, a moment Karthik described as ‘kind of a down point in my geography career.’ Is Sathwik smarter? ‘In some ways he is, in some ways he isn't,’ Karthik said. ‘The questions this year that they asked were of his liking, and that's the chief reason why he won.’ The boys' mother, Rathma, and her husband, Vishwanath, who both work in the software industry, emigrated from near Mangalore, India, in 2002. Indian-American children have dominated both the National Geographic Bee and the Scripps National Spelling Bee in recent years. Vishwanath said the trend can be attributed to coming from a country of 1.2 billion people. Chosen few: Ten participants made the finals, culled from a field of 54 state-level winners . ‘That brought us the competitive spirit,’ he said. ‘If we don't work hard and put forth our best effort, we can't succeed in this world.’ Ten participants made the finals, culled from a field of 54 state-level winners in Monday's preliminary round. Sathwik led throughout the final round and was the last contestant to get a question wrong. Participants earned between 1 and 5 points for each correct answer, with the harder questions worth more points, and the competitors with the lowest scores were eliminated at various points in the competition. Sathwik won a $25,000 scholarship, a trip to the Galapagos Islands and a lifetime membership in the National Geographic Society. The finals will be televised Thursday night on the National Geographic Channel and Nat Geo WILD. Conrad, the runner-up, won a $15,000 scholarship. Ricky Uppaluri of Roswell, Ga., at 11 the youngest of the finalists, was third and receives a $10,000 scholarship. Akhil Rekulapelli of Ashburn, Va., finished fourth and won $1,000 in cash. Impressive haul: Karnik walked away with a $25,000 scholarship, a free trip to the Galapagos Islands and a lifetime membership in the National Geographic Society . Also represented in the finals were California, Michigan, Colorado, New Hampshire, Oregon and Wisconsin. Sathwik, an aspiring doctor who also plays chess competitively, said he was nervous at first because he had never been on television before, but he became more comfortable as he rattled off a string of correct answers. He said he buckled down once he realized he had a chance to win, because he didn't want to return to the bee next year. Children can compete from fourth to eighth grade, but winners are ineligible to defend their title. In his bee finalist video, the 12-year-old said he is fascinated that the first chocolate chip cookie was made in Whitman, Mass., and he joked that he could transfer all the geographic facts from a flash drive into his brain . Dream vacation: Karnik said that the place he would like to visit most in the world in the Galapagos Islands, which is exactly where he will be heading soon . ‘I didn't want to go back because it's just a lot of preparation and a lot of nervousness,’ he said. ‘I wanted to finish it this time.’ ‘Jeopardy!’ host Alex Trebek, who has moderated the bee finals since the inaugural competition in 1989, is stepping down after this year and will be replaced by broadcast journalist Soledad O'Brien. During a commercial break, Trebek warned the audience at Washington's National Theatre not to blurt out or silently mouth the answers. ‘As if that's likely to happen,’ he said to laughter. ‘Most of you can't even find Detroit.’","Sathwik Karnik won $25,000 scholarship, trip to Galapagos Islands and lifetime membership in National Geographic Society .

"PUBLISHED: . 19:05 EST, 22 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:58 EST, 22 May 2013 . A professional basketball player might not be feeling very grown up today after he debuted a huge back tattoo only for someone to point out a glaring spelling error. The word? Mature. While not on the court, Oklahoma City Thunder’s Kevin Durant has been busy getting a lot of ink done. A masterpiece appears to take up basically the entirety of the 6-foot-9 ballers back. All grown up? Down at the bottom of this massive tattoo, 24-year-old basketball star Kevin Durant's back now permanently misspells 'mature' The 24-year-old forward debuted his body art, which features an angel looking down upon a crucified Jesus Christ, on his Instagram feed Tuesday night. Beside the religious imagery is a bible verse, and it is those words that have Durant, whose contract with the Thunder will pay $85 million, looking juvenile. ‘All done,’ wrote Durant along with his post. ‘James 1:2-4…look it up.’ Unfortunately for Durant, a reader at Deadspin did look it up and found something suspect. Grounded: The tattoo features an angel with a basketball and Jesus Christ's head, along with the misspelling, which is within a bible verse . But they needn’t have gone through the trouble because no matter where the words come from, ‘mature’ is always spelled the same way. And Durant’s back has it wrong. ‘Let it do its work,’ the tattoo reads, ‘so you become mautre and well-developed…’ The ‘U’ and the ‘T’ have evidently been transposed. As embarrassing as this must be for the two-time NBA scoring champion, he’s not the first high-profile, high-earning name to get incorrect ink. Hayden Panettiere, the young star of ABC’s Nashville, recently opened up in an issue of Glamour Magazine about some words inked onto her back. Common: Starlet Hayden Panettiere is also in the famous people with misspelled tattoos club, one of the Italian words seen here is incorrectly spelled . The phrase, in Italian, reads ‘Vivere . senza rimipianti’ or ‘Live without regrets.’ However, there is an extra . ‘i’ and it’s supposed to read ‘rimpianti.’ ‘So . I literally have to live by that advice,’ joked the starlet, who said . she’ll likely get it fixed but isn’t overly concerned for now. Britney . Spears made a similar mistake when she once got a tattoo of Chinese . characters on her hip intending it to say ‘mysterious,’ but it actually . meant ‘strange.’ And heavily inked David Beckham is even in the club. He once got a tattoo that misspelled wife Victoria’s first name. As mockery of Durant's mishap swelled Wednesday along with the inflamed skin of his back, he apparently rushed to get the mistake fixed. He updated his Instagram feed around 8pm along with a new picture, writing: . 'I got mature spelled the right way lol.' All better: Durant was mocked across the Web Wednesday and apparently knew it: he updated his Instagram to show he's now fixed the mistake . Permanent: Heavily tattooed David Beckham is in the club, too. He even misspelled wife Victoria's name .","Oklahoma City's multi-million dollar baller is looking mighty juvenile, but Hayden Panettiere, David Beckham, and Britney Spears are also in in the incorrectly inked celebrity club ."

Houston Texans’ defensive end JJ Watt is fast gaining a reputation as the NFL’s Mr Nice and someone who’s heart is almost as big as his 6ft 5in, 295lb frame. Watt is the kind of sports star that goes out of his way to make space in his busy schedule to meet his fans, especially those that are most deserving. On Monday he came face-to-face with one of his bravest fans in the shape of a young man called Itzy Cagen. Magical meeting: On Monday Itzy Cagen came face-to-face with his hero Houston Texans' defensive end JJ Watt . As well as being one of Watt's biggest fans, Cagen is also the longest surviving quadriplegic in the world. The victim of a tragic accident at the age of two, for more than 20 years ago Itzy has been confined to his wheelchair, and lacks the ability to eat, sleep and move around without relying on the help of another person or machine. The meeting came about after Itzy’s helper Eran Melnik took to JJ’s Facebook fan page to tell him about one of his biggest fans. Melnik wrote: ‘I have been his nurse for four years now and I don't think there is a bigger Texans fan out there. During the season, every morning I would wake him up and he would announce ""J. J. SWATT!!!"". Itzy Cagen, right, is the world's longest surviving quadriplegic and a massive fan of JJ Watt . 'Just thought you would like to know that he is out there and would love to meet you if at all possible. We understand that you are busy, but who knows? Send me a message if anything comes up....’ Almost immediately, Itzy's friends created a social media storm around the effort. Comedy writer Jenny Johnson shared the photo in a tweet to more than 300,000 of her followers, reports Kids of Courage. After 103 days, nearly 1,500 Likes and more than 270 shares, the photo was seen by the NFL superstar on May 13. ‘We will make this happen,’ he succinctly commented on Melnik’s post. On May 21st, 111 days after Melnik posted the photo, the wait was over. Itzy Cagen and JJ Watt met for the first time. Later that day, Melnik took to Facebook once again: 'Thank you so much, JJ Watt, for taking the time out of your busy schedule to make Itzy extremely happy! JJ Watt tweet this picture of his time spent with Itzy and said it had been a pleasure to meet him . 'It was great to meet a superstar who honestly is a genuinely good person. Gives me faith in humanity to know that someone with his status can be so generous and giving.' 'He is my hero,' Itzy wrote referring to Watt. He writes using his head, the only portion of his body that he is able to move at free will. Equipped with a special device attached to his forehead, Itzy carefully pecked each letter. This isn't the first time the NFL star has gone out of his way to connect with his fans. On Monday he paid a surprise visit to the home of Cristian Beasley, a young fan dealing with leukemia in Splendora, Texas. Back in January, he ‘married’ a six-year-old fan whose mother had posted a heartbroken YouTube video of her sulking because she 'isn't 25 yet but wants to marry J.J. Watt.' The video featured young Breanna, sobbing and feeling very sorry for herself. Texans star Watt surprised young fan Breanna by asking her if she would be his bride for the day . The video posted on YouTube features young Breanna sobbing and feeling very sorry for herself because she can't marry JJ Watt . ‘I wish I was 25,’ she sobbed. ‘Why do you wish you were 25?’ her mother asks. ‘So I could marry JJ Watt.’ ‘Do you love JJ Watt?’ ‘Mmm-hmmm.’ ‘He's handsome, isn't he?’ 'Mm-hmm,' she nodded through the tears. Someone sent Watt a link to the video and he decided he wanted to do something about it. Breanna and JJ pose with ring pops and flowers as part of their very special one day marriage . 'I saw the YouTube video,' explained Watt. 'I hate to see . tears on my fans. So we put it out there on Twitter and Facebook to see . if we could find her. The two meet in person at the Houston Texans' Reliant Stadium on Wednesday. 'She didn’t know I was going to be there. When she walked in, I had flowers and was down on one knee with a ring . in my pocket,' explained Watt. 'I asked her if she would be my pretend wife for a day. She said yes of course.' Watt brought along one of his white jerseys to act as a pretend wedding dress and the couple had their first dance to her favorite singer Justin Bieber. 'It was a very cool day. Very special to see such a smile on her face. To . have the ability to do that is so neat. Anytime I can give back to the . fans. I want to do something if I can,' said Watt. Watt brought along one of his white jerseys to act as a pretend wedding dress and the couple had their first dance to her favorite singer Justin Bieber . This heart-warming interaction with a young fan has certainly boosted Watt’s nice guy image with his growing legion of fans. He posted the pictures from their 'wedding' on Facebook and so far they have attracted 51,302 Likes, been shared 5,331 times and received 3,374 comments, the majority of which are people . It’s almost impossible not to be a JJ Watt fan after this touching display of fan interaction, which puts so many of his NFL colleagues to shame. On the field Watt had a great second season, he led the NFL in sacks, the Texans won the AFC South and he started last Sunday's Pro Bowl. Up until recently Watt had complained that he is having trouble finding a girlfriend, but is now reported to be dating Sydney Leroux, a 20-year-old Forward on the US Women’s National soccer team. Hopefully young Breanna hasn’t found out about that or she will be heartbroken all over again.

Let's go back down the canyon,' Cendoya said after being released from hospital. 'And I must've fallen. And I . don't know if Kyndall took a fall and was unconscious.' Once separated, the two were unaware even if the other one had survived.

The search for Cendoya and Jack cost Orange County an estimated $160,000. Last week, county officials decided they don't have the authority to seek reimbursement from the pair, but they're now seeking to change that.

An Army sergeant has been charged with secretly photographing and videotaping at least a dozen women at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, including in a bathroom and showers. The Army said on Wednesday that Sgt 1st Class Michael McClendon is facing charges of dereliction of duty, mistreatment, entering a women's bathroom without notice, and taking and possessing inappropriate photos and videos of women who were naked or in various states of undress. The women have been notified by the Army about the matter. Accusation: An Army sergeant at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, pictured, has been charged with secretly photographing and videotaping at least a dozen women . Shocking allegations: The Army says it has notified the female cadets about the matter . McClendon, who is a combat engineer and joined the military in 1990, was assigned to the academy from 2009 to this month. He was a member of the support staff at West Point, working with cadets. He was charged on May 14 with violating four articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, but some of the allegations date back to 2009. He has been transferred to Fort Drum, New York. The case is the latest in an embarrassing series of arrests and incidents of sexual misconduct across the military, and comes on the heels of a Pentagon report that estimated that as many as 26,000 service members may have been sexually assaulted last year. 'The Army is committed to ensuring the safety and welfare of our Cadets at the Military Academy at West Point - as well as all soldiers throughout our Army,' said Gen John Campbell, vice chief of staff of the Army, in a statement. Startling trend: The case is the latest in an embarrassing series of arrests and incidents of sexual misconduct across the military . 'Once notified of the violation, a full investigation was launched, followed by swift action to correct the problem. Our cadets must be confident that issues such as these are handled quickly and decisively, and that our system will hold those responsible accountable.' The charges, first reported by The New York Times, detail that he took videos of various women's body parts without their consent. And the charges note that the videos have been recovered. According to the Army, McClendon was relieved of his duties on May 17, 2012, and was ordered to have no contact with cadets and was barred from entering cadet areas on the post. The yearlong delay in formally charging McClendon was because of the complexities of the case and the effort to recover the forensic evidence. McClendon, who is from Blakely, Georgia, is doing military duty at Fort Drum, and is not being held in a jail. Growing problem: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, left, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey, right, have been asked by President Obama to lead a process to root out the problem of sexual abuse within the U.S. military . Army spokesman George Wright said that throughout the notification process, the Army will protect the privacy of the individuals involved as well as offer support services as required. In recent weeks, military leaders have expressed anger and shame over their failure to stem the escalating sexual abuse across the services. In a meeting last week with defense and military officials, President Obama asked Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey to lead a process to root out the problem. Calling it a crisis, Dempsey said the women who serve in the military are losing confidence that the problem can be solved.","Sgt 1st Class Michael McClendon charged with dereliction of duty, and entering a women's bathroom without notice - among other charges .

"By . Brian Viner and Jane Viner . PUBLISHED: . 17:03 EST, 22 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:48 EST, 23 May 2013 . We may have been married for 20 years but, until this week, I had never sent my wife a love letter, writes BRIAN VINER. Nor had she ever sent one to me. To be honest, they always seemed a bit, well, un-British. And unbefitting to a couple in their early 50s, with three children, the oldest at university. But when I heard that Great Gatsby actress Carey Mulligan and her husband, the singer Marcus Mumford, exchange frequent love letters, it set me thinking. If they do it, why can’t we? So, would our first ever love letters set our suburban household alight? Still making each other laugh after 20 years: Brian and Jane Viner . My Darling Jane, . The great essayist Anais Nin once wrote that age does not protect you from love, but that ‘love, to some extent, protects you from age’. That is what I feel, with all my heart. At 51, I suppose I am in the earlyish autumn of my years. At any rate, if I were a tree, I’d be shedding a few rust-coloured leaves. But I don’t mind. It will be fun to shed them together, and regain the independence we had before the children  were born. Weekends away at the drop of a hat. Do you remember all those hats we used to drop? I wondered, when contemplating this letter, whether to quote Shakespeare, who was so good at expressions of love. But using other people’s lines, even Anais Nin’s, is a cop-out. Besides, everybody’s version of love is different. Inspiration: Actress Carey Mulligan and her musician husband Marcus Mumford exchange frequent love letters . Who honestly believes, as the actress Ali McGraw once put it, that love means never having to say you’re sorry? I’ve said a million sorries to you - and you, getting on for, what, 11 or 12 to me? Did that make you laugh? I hope so, because for you and me, love and laughter are indivisible. Ten years ago, when I wrote a book about our move from the city to the country, I dedicated it ‘To Jane, the wind beneath my wings, the compost beneath my beans’. In some ways, that said it all. I wanted you to know what you meant to me, and what you have done for me, but I banged in a gag to pre-empt any accusations of soppiness. In a way, I do wish I could reach for one of Shakespeare’s sonnets to tell you how much I love you. And if I were to compare thee to a summer’s day, it would be that early-evening bit when I pour two glasses of chilled rosé and we sit at the garden table, watching the dogs chasing each other round the lawn. One of those moments of such profound happiness that they elicit not a smile, but a sigh. On their wedding day: Brian proposed on a beach in Suffolk . I know that writing a public love letter to me will make you wince, since you don’t even believe in going out on Valentine’s Day. I can’t claim to be Prince Charming, either. But I fancy you just as much as I did when I first sat at your desk in the newspaper office where you were deputy news editor and I was a novice reporter. Who’d have thought then that we’d end up making three children together? More than two decades on, I’m still as beguiled by those amazing greeny-blue eyes as much as I ever was. More than anything else, though, I respect and admire you, for your interest in the world, for your wit, for your intelligence, for your incredible culinary skills, for your kindness to your friends, and above all, for your endless commitment, patience and resourcefulness as a mother. I have to admit that when you were pregnant with Eleanor, our firstborn, I was worried. Part of what had so attracted me to you was your no-nonsense professionalism in the workplace, and I didn’t know what would replace that, when, if only temporarily, you gave up work. It was hopelessly naïve of me not to realise that, overnight, your skills as a mother would seem more important to both of us than your skills in your job. But then, it is hopelessly naïve of any couple to embark on a life together expecting it to be  sun-kissed most of the way through. Yet, even in this peculiar age of pre-nuptial agreements, we all do it. Well, I think our 20 years of  marriage have, indeed, been more sun-kissed than not. That particular naïve expectation came true. And even in times of drizzle, I have never wanted to share the umbrella with anyone but you.I love you. And thank you, for everything. Yours husband, Brian xxx . Hi Darling, . Not usually romantic: Jane is unaccustomed to making declarations of love . Love letters. Hmm. Not sure what I . think, since any written declaration of love sounds borrowed from some . other, more lyrical writer, and anyway, I come from a long line of . Yorkshire women - a species not known for their romanticism. And you already know that I love you, . because I sometimes defy my Yorkshire heritage and say so. Not so often . that the words lose their meaning, but not so rarely that you could ever . forget. But declarations of love, I think, mean . more when they’re made at surprising moments, not when they’re flagged . up by marketing men at Thorntons. This is why you and I give Valentine’s . Day a body swerve - although if it weren’t for me, you’d be more of a . chocolates and flowers man yourself. You’re a natural romantic, and I’m . really not. I love you with all my heart, but I . laughed when you proposed, on that deserted beach in Suffolk, in 1992. And worse, perhaps, than sniggering at the Big Question, was year after . year forgetting our wedding anniversary. We were married on January 7 (for a . while I thought it was January 5) and I still maintain it’s a terrible . day for an anniversary. First day back to school after Christmas more . often than not; lunchboxes to prepare, plimsolls to find, children to . corral. Harassed and harried, I would pass you at the front door, give . you a cursory goodbye, and you would wait until then to say: ‘Happy . anniversary, darling’. It has been my very good fortune to have . married a man who laughs in the face of such casual neglect, enjoying . the joke of a stereotype being turned on its head. This is because you . have a dear, forgiving nature from which I (sharp-tongued sometimes and . not always very fair) benefit, time and again. Your love for me is sustaining and . humbling, and although I appear to be taking it for granted, it . underpins my life. I’m better at the anniversaries these days, because I . do think it’s important to honour and cherish a husband as loving and . gracious as you are. And you’re the funniest person I know; . even your Les Dawson moments make me laugh, and after the joke, your . laughter makes me laugh: that shoulder-heaving, almost silent laughter . that usually ends with you getting wheezy. Still happy together: The couple have raised three children . When you look back over our two decades of marriage, does it make you smile to think of all the times we have laughed? Twenty years, Brian! I’m sure we felt . like adults when we married, but we’ve grown up together. We’ve had . children, moved house, navigated stormy waters. I’ve always depended on . you, and always known I  could. You are my safe harbour. I worry, you reassure. So often you’ve . said to me: ‘If you want to know our future, look at our past,’ and . although none of us really knows what lies ahead, I can almost believe . that you do. So, what this unromantic Barnsley lass . would like to say is, Thank you for remaining, through thick and thin, . my lovely, lovely husband: handsome, generous, courteous, and full of . love for me and for the children (who thanks to you can all throw and . catch a ball, have almost perfect table manners, love a good sunset and . never forget to clean their teeth.) The wonderful, mysterious alchemy . between us that produced our offspring is a source of daily joy, and as . good a testament to our love as any I could wish for. They’re nearly grown now, and before too . long it’ll be you and me again, so, this is the plan. We’ll hire a . classic car — a two-seater, and you can choose — and take a lengthy, . leisurely drive through France, staying in auberges and eating in those . restaurants that we read about and never visit. It’ll be a second honeymoon for my funny valentine and me. Jane x . Touched: Brian is glad they put pen to paper . Despite our misgivings and fears, our love letters have touched us both. What we said was truly heartfelt. Moreover, there was the added dimension of distance between us when we wrote them, for I was in the Caribbean, on a writing assignment, and Jane was at home in north Herefordshire. The next challenge will be to exchange love letters when I am upstairs at my computer, and she is downstairs at hers. But I really think we might.","Actress Carey Mulligan and her husband exchange frequent love letters .

He collected more than 200 shots of bemused – but relieved – parking offenders during the two-and-a-half years he patrolled the streets of Brighton and Hove. Pictured: Steven Jarvis compiled more than 200 shots of bemused, but relieved, parking offenders and intended to compile the shots into a book - but has now been sacked by council contractor NSL . In the photographs, the 35-year-old warden can be seen smiling and giving a ‘thumbs-up’ alongside motorists and their tickets. Mr Jarvis, who lives in a £250,000 two . bedroom flat in Brighton, intended to turn the pictures into a book but . he has now been sacked by the council’s contractor NSL. He started taking pictures to defuse . the tension when issuing fines. He said: ‘There’s always a whole . different range of emotions when someone gets a parking ticket. ‘Some laugh it off, some are angry and . women would often be in floods of tears. There were attacks on other . traffic wardens, but never on me. ‘Lots of traffic wardens just walk off . when someone asks why they’ve got a ticket. That just puts people’s . backs up. But I was different – I’d talk to people and tell them I could . help them.’ Mr Jarvis told motorists that he could . not rescind their penalty but would back their appeal by making . favourable notes in his pocketbook. All they had to do was to pose for a . picture with their ticket. Traffic warden: Steven Jarvis convinced drivers in Brighton and Hove (pictured) that he could assist appeals . ‘After that most people just relaxed. They were from all walks of life – doctors, builders, all sorts,’ he . said. ‘But I didn’t give them any concrete assurances. ‘Being a traffic warden is all about having the right personality. The pictures were part of that, I guess.’ Mr Jarvis claims that bosses at NSL . had known for more than a year before they fired him that  he was taking . the photos and had banned him from using his official work camera. He . said: ‘They pulled me upstairs and told me they weren’t comfortable with . me taking the pictures. But I just carried on, using my own camera. ‘I think the pictures are fantastic – . they’re really funny. I showed some of my colleagues my pictures and . they said I should put them in a book. ‘Every day they would ask me if I had taken any pictures of any photogenic people.’ NSL said Mr Jarvis had been sacked partly for taking the pictures but also for ‘other reasons’. ‘This was an isolated case. We are . still investigating the incident but it is clear Mr Jarvis wasn’t . meeting the standards we expect from a traffic enforcement officer,’ a . spokesman said. ‘Appeals have to meet special criteria and the pictures would have had no effect.’ Publishing the pictures in a book was a . ‘non-starter’, the firm said. ‘These photographs were taken in work . time and remain the property of NSL.’ Mr Jarvis insisted: ‘The pictures are . mine, I took them with my camera, so I’m definitely going to do the . book. They can’t stop me.’","Steven Jarvis, 35, was working for council contractor NSL in Brighton .

"By . Talal Musa . PUBLISHED: . 10:25 EST, 14 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:53 EST, 14 May 2013 . It is one of the most popular games on the planet - serving an ever-growing community of millions. And with Runescape 3 around the corner, MailOnline talked to CEO of Jagex, Mark Gerhard, about the game, the challenges facing free-to-play games and...owning a tank.What is it about Runescape that has made it so successful? MG: 'It’s because RuneScape is unique! It’s always been easy to jump in: it’s free to get started and runs from your web browser and doesn’t the need any download. 'The gameplay is also different from most other online RPGs – RuneScape is about freedom to do your own thing without restrictions; you can be any type of character you want, you can explore a whole world, you can choose from a wide variety of gameplay from crafting to fighting, from trading to questing – it’s all up to you. It’s also less action intensive than most similar games, which makes it a more relaxing experience that you can take at your own pace.'How has the world of Gielinor been tweaked? Are there new kingdoms and different ways to travel? MG: 'Gielinor has always been evolving in the 12 years of RuneScape’s history. We’ve added new continents, new dungeons and new cities. 'There are also many ways to travel, whether running, using teleport spells, spirit trees, fairy rings or even hot air balloons! Recently we added an easy way to travel called the Lodestone Network, which is ideal for new players to hop between important game locations quickly.' Pretty as a picture: With the updated graphics engine, RuneScape 3 rivals Warcraft's visual fidelity . What inspired monster design in Runescape? MG: 'A huge variety of things really, spanning from world mythology, childhood memories to the colourful corners of our own imaginations. 'Sometimes is great just to ask an artist to explore ideas using a few keywords to get the creative juices flowing, and then build the backstory of the monsters after the creation of the concept art, turning the “normal” process on its head. 'As a company we have a strong background in traditional storytelling so there are always some crazy ideas floating around.' How did you develop / design different spells? MG: 'Spells tend to start with a written design since they are generally very practical and have a strong motive behind their addition to the game. 'We need to think about their cost to cast (mages use rune stones to release magical energy, a bit like mystical batteries) and the amount of damage they do to opponents. RuneScape is an Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG). Players travel around the land of Gielinor battling monsters and trading. With more than 200million accounts created, it was recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as the largest MMORPG in the world. 'Mages in RuneScape don’t only deal with big fireballs and lightning bolts in combat though, we have spells for all sorts of things, including baking pies, enchanting magical jewellery and even turning bones into bananas. These spells are often themed to different sorts of spell books too.' Are there many changes to the in-game trading mechanic? MG: 'No. In RuneScape players are free to trade pretty much anything to anyone, and we have a player run grand exchange stock market, where players buy and sell items from humble potatoes to glorious god swords. 'Prices are calculated by actual supply and demand and so can fluctuate depending on the activity of the players at the time.'How have you listened to fans criticisms of the first game? And have the fans steered the development of the game? MG: 'Definitely, we’ve always been community focused and this year we’re really trying to step that up again. 'The story in RuneScape 3 is going to be shaped by players, week by week over the course of this year. 'We’re doing beta tests for the new HTML5 client and the New Interface System because we really want player feedback to guide our development. We’ve also recently run a poll to see which other storyline players want to see continued next – the Dwarf quest series triumphed over Pirates and Gnomes!' Towering heights: This is the largest of the RuneScape games,  boasting new cities and continents . Can we expect to see many changes in combat? MG: 'We released a brand new combat system last year and have been working with our players to polish it ever since. It’s far more exciting and engaging than ever before, rewarding players for tactical decisions and intelligent use of equipment… as well as being really fun! 'RuneScape doesn’t limit players to only ever adopt one combat style, so you can find yourself switching between brutal 2 handed swords, magical staffs, duel wielding crossbows, tower shields, even summon mighty creatures to do your bidding.'Are there any changes in the Grand Exchange? (answered above) How have you rid the game of unbalanced trading and real currency being traded for virtual goods? MG: 'Rather than make modifications to the gameplay to deal with unwanted activity, we have specialised systems that can detect accounts that are real world trading and deal with them according to our rules. '“Fairness” is incredibly important to us and we don’t ignore the problem like other games often do. We actively hunt those who are generating wealth (also known as gold farming) with the intention to sell, and often seek legal solutions to the problem.'How have the graphics been improved? Do you think it can compete visually with the likes of World of Warcraft now? MG: 'RuneScape is definitely one of the best looking browser games out there and we’re competitive with even the big download-based titles out there. 'The new HTML5 client also gives us a great platform to continue building on, further improving the graphics with better visual fidelity and more visual effects.' Open to everyone: Graphics can be scaled up or down depending on your hardware specifications . What does the future of MMOs hold? Do you think it’ll be a ‘survival of the fittest’ – where we see just one or two dominant MMOs ruling online? MG: 'MMOs have definitely been diversifying and it’s not just a genre full of World of Warcraft clones any more. 'There are many more games on offer and Free to Play is becoming the standard. Players have much more choice now, so it’s not enough to have just a decent game anymore – to survive MMOs will need to be have something really interesting and different on offer. 'The most successful games will be those who can managed to both innovate whilst also listening carefully to their communities.' Lastly, is it true that you own a tank? MG: 'Yes, that is true - and you won't believe how little it costs to insure! The MPG isn't great, though.' RunScape 3 is released in the summer.

Royal Marine Robert Barnett was fined after photos on Facebook showed him impersonating a superior . A Royal Marine who impersonated a superior and used medals bought on the internet has been fined, after photographs of him were spotted on Facebook. Robert Barnett, who was a corporal at the time, wore medals he had not earned and the uniform of a sergeant, as he wanted to ‘big himself up’ at a family wedding, a court martial heard yesterday. The 33-year-old serviceman’s superiors, of 40 Commando, were ‘livid’ after pictures of him at the event were posted on the social networking site. Barnett, who is based near Taunton, Somerset, was promoted to sergeant in March this year and was an acting sergeant for six months in 2011. But at the time of the wedding in June, 2012, Barnett was still a corporal, the court martial at Portsmouth was told. The Marine, who has toured in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo during his 16 years of service, denied the charge but was found guilty of ‘conduct prejudicial to good order and service discipline’ and fined £300. In a written statement read to the court martial, Regimental Sergeant Major Joseph Gillespie said: ‘When I asked Corporal Barnett why he had worn the medals and uniform, he said he “wanted to look good in front of his family and big himself up”. ‘He had bought the medals from a company he had found on the internet and had them engraved and mounted.’ Barnett, based at HMS Raleigh in Plymouth, admitted he had worn the uniform and medals, but he denied conduct that was prejudicial to good order and service discipline because it was a private event. Imposing the sentence, Judge Advocate Robert Hill said: 'In the military community rank is hard earned, respect is hard earned and medals are hard earned. People find it offensive when people abuse it by wearing a uniform and medals they have no business wearing at all.' Captain Benjamin Taylor, prosecuting, told the one-day court martial in Portsmouth that Barnett, who was described in court as professional and generous, had been an acting sergeant in 2011. But he was a corporal again in June last year and wore the sergeant’s uniform, plus a long service and good conduct medal, a Nato medal for operations in Afghanistan and the King’s Badge - awarded to the best recruit of any batch to pass out from training - all of which he was not entitled to wear. The red circle on the arm of the No.1 dress uniform (left)  highlights the sergeant's three stripes which as a corporal, Barnett was not entitled to wear. At the same wedding he can be seen proudly displaying medals (right) on a  mess uniform which, again, gave the false impression he was of a higher rank . He explained that the medals were a gift from his father  and that his family asked to wear the uniform. He has since been made a sergeant and can be seen here in attire that now corresponds with his position . Capt Taylor said by wearing the items . Barnett had 'fundamentally undermined good order and discipline and . showed complete disregard to them' and 'he did it to show off and . impress others'. The court heard that the offence came . to light when other marines saw the images of Barnett at the wedding in . Harrow, north London, on Facebook that had been tagged. Colour Sergeant Dominic Conway said he was 'livid' when he saw the pictures and tackled Barnett about it. 'I was quite surprised and shocked. He was not entitled. I was livid about it,' he told the court. Giving evidence, Barnett said that . his family asked him to wear his uniform and that he had not had time to . alter his dress uniform back to the rank of corporal. He denied he had said he wanted to 'big himself up' to RSM Gillespie. Judge Advocate Robert Hill said: 'In the military community rank is hard earned, respect is hard earned and medals are hard earned. People find it offensive when people abuse it by wearing a uniform and medals they have no business wearing at all.' (Royal Marines file picture) He . explained that the medals were a gift from his father and he used them . as his real ones had been sent away to have the Diamond Jubilee Medal . added. He said he borrowed the mess uniform from someone else and it had the King’s badge on it and he was aware of its significance. 'I . knew I was not a sergeant. It was a private wedding and I never thought . the photos would see the light of day,' he told the court. But the court martial panel of three Royal Navy officers found him guilty of the charge. In mitigation, the court heard that . Barnett meant no disrespect to the service, but he did it to keep his . partner happy as she wanted him to wear the uniform. The charge carried a maximum of two years imprisonment.","Royal Marine wore medals he had not earned and uniform of a sergeant .

Two children found living in a 5-by-10-foot unit at a storage facility in New Jersey had been staying there with their mother for about a month, authorities said Friday. Their mother, Sheena Johnson, 27, was arrested Thursday in Trenton on allegations that she slashed her ex-boyfriend's tires. As part of routine questioning in arrests involving domestic violence, police asked Johnson if she had any dependents and if so, where they were staying. Cramped living conditions: Two children found living in a 5-by-10-foot unit at a storage facility in New Jersey, pictured, had been staying there with their mother for about a month, authorities said Friday . Trenton Police Lieutenant Mark Kieffer said an officer became suspicious when Johnson began to respond evasively. The woman told police she had two children, ages 5 and 10, and they were waiting for a bus with another person near a storage facility where she had rented a unit. The officer drove to the facility in nearby Ewing and demanded the locker be opened. At first, no one would let him in without a search warrant. Then he told them there might be children inside, Kieffer said. When the officer opened the door, he found the children, along with a bare mattress, garbage bags filled with clothes, a suitcase, a backpack and other items strewn around the locker. ‘It was deplorable conditions,’ Kieffer said. Police said the children were examined at a hospital and found to be unharmed. They are now in state custody. Johnson was charged with child endangerment by Ewing police. She also faces charges of criminal mischief, domestic violence and violating a restraining order over her arrest in Trenton. Ewing Police Detective Sergeant John Stemler said one of his officers went to a nearby McDonald's to buy each child a Happy Meal. Stemler could not say what the children told police because their statements are part of the investigation. He said the storage facility is not being investigated. A unit that size at the Ewing location costs up to $70 a month, according to its website.Stemler was unaware of any past incidents where people were found living in the units. Police discovered the boys on Thursday surrounded by their worldly possessions in the Extra Space Storage Facility in Ewing, near Trenton, New Jersey, after their mother told them they were there. Officers were stunned to find the pair had been living in the 'filthy' unit amid old plastic bags, suit cases and lawn furniture, with just a bare mattress on the floor to sleep on. 'Horrible conditions': The Extra Space Storage Facility in Ewing, near Trenton, New Jersey, where two boys were found living in a five-foot by ten-foot unit after their mother was arrested . The two boys are now in protective custody with the New Jersey Department of Children and Families. There is as yet no word on how long they had been living there. Trenton and Ewing police went to the storage company on the 1400 block of Prospect Street in Ewing at 10.40am yesterday morning, following their mother's arrest for allegedly slashing the tyres on her boyfriend's car. Following procedure for domestic violence incidents, police asked Sheena Johnson if she had any dependants and it was then that she revealed her family's desperate living situation. Police discovered her 5-year-old and 10-year-old sons living inside the five-foot by ten-foot unheated unit on the third floor of the the Extra Space Storage facility. 'They were living in horrible conditions,' Lieutenant Mark Kieffer of the Trenton Police told The Trentonian. He added to NJ.com: 'That's where their house is - that's where they're living. It was just filthy in there.' Both boys were dirty but uninjured and did not appear to be malnourished. Nevertheless, they were hungry and officers bought them McDonald's Happy Meals before leading them out of the facility. They were reportedly taken for check ups at the Capital Health Regional Medical Center before being released in the care of social services. Lieutenant Kieffer said that it was likely that Johnson had been living their with the two children but had left them inside when she went out to Trenton yesterday morning. She was arrested there after allegedly slashing the tyres on Calhoun Street, he said. Hungry, dirty but unhurt: The boys, aged five and ten, were reportedly taken for check ups at the Capital Health Regional Medical Center (pictured) before being released in the care of social services . A renter of another unit said he believed the family had been living there 'for months'. There is no heat inside the units and only the hallways are wired for electricity, he said. Staff at the Extra Space Storage Facility had initially refused access to officers without a warrant, but relented after they were told there could be children in danger, said Lieutenant Kieffer. Flo Auletta, who owns a restaurant across the road from the storage company told the Trentonian that paramedics, code enforcement officials and social workers subsequently arrived on the scene. Ewing Mayor Bert Steinmann told the paper that the discovery had left him 'shocked and appalled' and said he had called the town's two other storage companies to check there was nothing similar occurring. 'I just wished the mother would have sought help instead of going down the route she took,' he added. 'There’s Homefront, the County’s Board of Social Services, Women’s Space — anything would have been better.' Johnson, 27, who was initially held on a charge of criminal mischief, has now been charged with two counts of second-degree child endangerment and last night remained in the custody of Ewing Police.","Five-year-old and ten-year-old found in 'horrible conditions' in the cramped unit after their mother was arrested .

It was Ladies Night at the Baltic Inn and 150 women had packed into the pub to see Fabio the male stripper in all his glory. But muscular Fabio had to cancel at the last minute and was replaced by novice Leon Zbudowskyj. Unfortunately Mr Zbudowskyj fell far short of the audience’s expectations. He was scruffy, thin, had no six-pack and looked as though ‘he had been hit in the face with a wok’. Unsatisfied: The crowd was expecting heart-throb Fabio, left, but instead got 'dirty' Leon Zbudowskyj, right . High hopes: The crowd had paid £10 each to see sexy Fabio at the Baltic Inn, but he was forced to cancel . What’s more, he had no act to speak of . either, and very soon the crowd was hurling abuse and screwed up . napkins in his direction. Just when it seemed that the . £10-a-head evening could get no worse the stripper, provoked by  the . abuse, apparently plunged into the crowd and started attacking the . women. Five police cars were sent to break up . the scuffles at the Baltic, at Pontyates, near Llanelli, South Wales . and 29-year-old Zbudowskyj was arrested on suspicion of assault. Compere Debra Jones said: ‘He was diabolical, he was disgusting, he just didn’t have anything, no music, no dance routine. 'Diabolical': Replacement Zbudowskyj (pictured) was not quite what the women wanted to see . ‘He looked like he had come off the . street, he looked dirty, he was unshaven and he didn’t have a six pack.

Mr Zbudowskyj, who describes himself . on Facebook as an ‘entrepreneur’, was due to be paid £150 for the show . and stomped on stage dressed as a fireman. But the uniform didn’t fit . and his performance was far from smouldering. The crowd, expecting a Full .

Miss Jones said: ‘He didn’t move, he just glared at the audience. The . women started booing and they then started scrunching up serviettes and . throwing them at him.’ Viv Davies, 58, who has owned the . country inn for seven years, said the disastrous evening had not put her . off hosting a similar night. ‘We have even set a date for the next . one – although I think we may steer away from firemen next time,’ she . said. The Fantasy Strip agency said it will not be working with Mr . Zbudowskyj again. A spokesman said: ‘It was the first time we had used him and he let us down big time. ‘We have warned other agencies to stay away from him as he will mess up their bookings and damage their reputations.’ Mr Zbudowskyj, of Cathays, Cardiff, who has been released on police bail pending further inquiries, was unavailable for comment.

Father's Anger: Johnny Berry - the father of Amanda Berry - has spoken of his rage at her accused kidnapper Ariel Castro and his desire to kill him . The father of Amanda Berry has revealed how his daughter is struggling to recover after ten years in captivity in Cleveland and is petrified that her accused kidnapper Ariel Castro is coming back for her. Johnny Berry, 52, who is dying from a deadly pulmonary disease, told the National Enquirer that 'Amanda's having a terrible time. She's having nightmares every night, waking up screaming and crying, terrified that Castro is coming after her, or that she's still a prisoner. 'She's told me she's afraid her freedom is a dream and she's going to wake up to the horror of finding out she is still a prisoner.' But as Amanda Berry recovers from her decade-long prison ordeal, her father has spoken of his anger to declare that he would like to kill her accused kidnapper Ariel Castro. 'If I could get my hands on that monster Castro, I'd kill him myself!' said Berry from his death bed in Elizabethton, Tennessee. Near paralyzed from recent back surgery, Berry, who is covered in tattoos and wears an uncomfortable neck brace, explained that if he can't kill Castro, then he wants him to rot in jail for the rest of his life. 'If I can't kill him, I don't want the state to execute him,' said Berry to the National Enquirer. 'That would be too easy for him.' John Berry poses with a photo of his daughter, Amanda Berry, outside his home in Elizabethton, Tennessee, on Wednesday, May 8, 2013 . 'I want him in prison for the rest of his life. I know people in there who can make his life a living hell for what he did to Amanda. I want them to beat the s**t out of him every single day.' Amanda Berry was dramatically rescued from Ariel Castro's Cleveland, Ohio, home along with Gina DeJesus, Michelle Knight and her own six year old child by Castro, Jocelyn on May 6th. The three women had been kept prisoner by Castro for almost ten years and suffered systematic rapes, beatings and induced abortions at the hands of the 52-year-old former school bus driver. It has been claimed that the three dogs who lived in the home with the girls were kept in better condition that they were - and the girls still have to decide whether they want to take them back. The last time that Johnny Berry saw his daughter, she was working as a 16-year-old in the local Burger King, enjoying her time at school where she was doing well.

Now, Johnny, who has served time himself in jail for sexual battery and aggravated assault, has expressed his fears that he may never see his daughter again or the grand-daughter he has never met. However, he told the National Enquirer that he has at least spoken to Amanda twice since her lucky escape earlier this month. 'When she called me, her voice was the most beautiful sound I ever heard,' said Johnny. 'She said, 'Hi daddy. I'm still alive. I love you, love you, love you!' We were both crying...it was the happiest day of my life.' Amanda, who is now 27 is living currently with her sister Beth Serrano in Cleveland and is said to be suffering from the horrifying memories of her ordeal at the hands of Castro.

She died in 2005. 'I can't say I was the best dad in the world,' admitted Johnny. 'I feel a lot of guilt that I wasn't there for Amanda when she needed me. 'If I had known where she was, I would have gotten a gun and gone over there and gotten her out myself, but we had no idea. It was like she just disappeared off the face of the earth.'

Despite his confirmation that his daughter is struggling, the three women rescued after being held captive in a Cleveland house for about a decade want the community to know they are doing fine and appreciate offers of help. The message was relayed in a letter released Tuesday by their attorneys. The letter said Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight are happy and safe. A charity fund to help the women has raised more than $650,000 from more than 6,800 donors. Berry broke through a locked door on May 6, yelled to neighbors for help and enabled Knight and DeJesus to escape. 'These three brave women have asked us to give this message to everyone who has expressed concern and support,' said the attorneys, who are representing the women for free. Beth Serrano, sister of Amanda Berry, speaks to the media after the arrival of Berry at Serrano's home Wednesday, May 8, 2013, in Cleveland . 'Amanda, Gina and Michelle want you to know they are doing well. They are happy and safe and continue to heal, a process that requires time and privacy. 'To have complete strangers offer loving support in the form of money, goods and services, reaching out to help like a family member, is appreciated in ways that are impossible to put into words.' Ariel Castro, a 52-year-old former school bus driver, has been charged with three counts of rape and four counts of kidnapping, one for each of the three women and one for Berry's 6-year-old daughter fathered by Castro. His defense team says he will plead not guilty. The case is pending before a Cuyahoga County grand jury.","Johnny Berry, 52, is full of rage at Ariel Castro and says if he could kill him - he would .

A badger has been ‘causing hysteria’ among girls at a grammar school. At a recent assembly at Folkestone School for Girls in Kent, pupils were advised not to approach the badger. Described as a 'giant', the animal has been spotted sniffing around classrooms, disrupting lessons and reportedly scaring the 'living daylights' out of pupils. The mother of one of the 1,048 girls . at the school believes the creature may have been disturbed in its sett . in the grounds by construction work. She said: 'It has been spotted several times within the grounds, scaring the living daylights out of the teenage girls.' The presence of the animal was brought up at a recent school assembly where the 1,048 grammar school girls were advised not to approach their wild visitor. On one occasion, the badger was spotted underneath a mobile classrooms and all the pupils were told to close the windows and not to leave until it was safe. The mother said: 'There were tales of it charging at a pupil and then sniffing her, but these are teenage girls who are full of drama. It is a giant badger and it is causing hysteria.' She said a second badger had been seen at the school last Thursday night, adding: 'I hope the giant badger and the others are captured humanely and moved as the school might start getting concerned about pupil safety,' she said. 'Some pupils are saying they are now too scared to walk past certain parts of the site in case a badger runs out and bites them.' School management confirmed it had received reports of an apparently disorientated badger wandering near school buildings on one occasion. It was observed and accompanied back to its sett by site staff and has not been seen since. School principal Tracy Luke said: 'We do have a badger sett in the school grounds, well away from school buildings.' She said a member of staff did mention the badger incident to pupils, asking them to let staff know if they saw a badger and suggesting that they should not approach it. At a recent assembly at Folkestone School for Girls in Kent, pupils were advised not to approach the badger . A spokesman for the Romney Marsh Countryside Project, said that badgers are harmless.He said: 'Badgers are not aggressive. They are actually very shy creatures. 'It is however, unusual to see them in the day.' He added: 'If a badger is seen in daytime more than once then it may be unwell and it is best to call the RSPCA.' The government is starting a cull of badgers in trial areas to combat bovine TB, aiming to reduce local populations by up to 70 per cent. Trial killings are due to begin in Gloucestershire and Somerset next month. But protesters say this will do little to help reduce the disease and are instead calling for vaccination for both badgers and cattle.","'Hysteria' has broken out at Folkestone School for Girls in Kent .

The trial of Russian media  magnate Alexander Lebedev got off to a farcical start yesterday when five witnesses refused to give evidence against him. The tycoon – whose family own The Independent and London Evening Standard – pleaded not guilty to a charge of hooliganism and assault ‘based on political hatred’. The allegation relates to a punch  Lebedev, 53, threw at businessman  Sergei Polonsky on a TV talk show. Accused: Russian media magnate Alexander Lebedev (front left, pictured leaving a court hearing in Moscow) pleaded not guilty to a charge of hooliganism today . Defiant: A witness told the court today that Mr Lebedev had been provoked before hitting Mr Polonsky. Five other witnesses refused to give evidence against him . Mr Lebedev, an outspoken critic of . Russian president Vladimir Putin, owns Novaya Gazeta, Moscow’s leading . investigative publication which regularly exposes state corruption. He is the most high-profile Putin . foe  to be dragged through the courts this year in what many see as a . Kremlin-inspired prosecution. If convicted, the former KGB agent faces up to five years in jail. However, yesterday’s refusal by  witnesses to attend court is a major blow to the state’s case. Even the lawyer for Mr Polonsky said his client would not give evidence and was out of the country. Commenting on the bizarre legal situation, Mr Lebedev’s lawyer, Genri Reznik, said: ‘I have never heard anything like this. Show: Mr Lebedev (left) allegedly lashed out at Sergei Polonsky during a Russian TV debate in 2011 . Emotions: A witness in the audience during the show told a court today that Mr Polonsky had been acting 'emotionally' before Mr Lebedev hit him . ‘Will the prosecutor’s office be so weak not even to bring their  witnesses? Is this how our people respect the system?’ Entering his not guilty plea on the . first day of his trial, Mr Lebedev said: ‘The gist of the charges is not . clear for me, particularly the point of political hatred, given that I . had never met Polonsky before, and had not actually spoken to him, apart . from a brief exchange. ‘My action had completely different reasons.’ Mr Lebedev has previously stated that . he hit out because he feared Mr Polonsky, a 40-year-old ex-paratrooper, . was poised to strike him. In another twist yesterday, a prosecution . witness ended up supporting Mr Lebedev’s version of events and denied . there was any political motive to the punch. Mother-of-five Anna Slavina, a member . of the studio audience at the 2011 TV talk show, said: ‘There were no . political discussions.’ Viral: Footage of the punch, when Polonsky fell backwards and was knocked off his chair, went viral on the internet . ‘It was an educational show, not entertaining, not political. I learned a lot,’ she said. She added that she approved of Mr Lebedev’s response to his extreme provocation. She said that before the punch was . thrown, Polonsky behaved ‘in a strongly emotional way. He was jumping . around’. Asked to clarify, she said: ‘He jumped, he waved. And Lebedev . tried to calm him down, just like a parent would calm down a naughty . child. ‘Strange, but Polonsky’s negative emotions for some reason were targeted at Lebedev.’ Mr Polonsky’s ‘quick and wide . gestures could have been considered to be dangerous,’ she said. ‘They . were talking, discussing, even shouting.’ Mr Lebedev ‘controlled himself’ she said. ‘Someone else in this situation would have acted more quickly and actively... Hooliganism: Russian President Vladimir Putin dubbed Lebedev's behaviour 'hooliganism' ‘Maybe it was because of the age . difference, Polonsky is young and active. Lebedev was in control of . himself, he tried to answer in a polite way...’ She also confirmed that at one point . Mr Polonsky threatened Mr Lebedev by saying: ‘I want to wipe your nose.’ ‘Yes he did,’ she said. ‘The presenter said – sit down, calm down. Lebedev reacted like a proper man, he controlled himself.’ The only other witness to give . evidence yesterday, cameraman Denis Kolozov, said he had been filming . the audience and only saw the punch later when footage of it went viral . on the internet. Mr Polonsky was last night believed to be in Israel. In March,  he was released on bail by a court in Cambodia over allegations that he kidnapped and assaulted six sailors. Commenting on the likelihood of . forcing Mr Polonsky to attend the trial, judge Andrei Bakhvalov said: . ‘Our bailiffs cannot search for him outside Russia, we are working only . on our territory.’ The trial will resume on Thursday.

'Outrageous': Russia's Dina Garipova received 'nul points' from Azerbaijan for her performance in the Eurovision Song Contest in Sweden . It may just be an annual singing contest to some, but Russia is certainly taking the Eurovision Song Contest seriously. Moscow’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday met his Azerbaijani counterpart to ask why the Caucasus country had not voted for Russia during last Saturday’s contest. The former Soviet republic gave Russia ‘nul points’, provoking fury in Moscow. Azerbaijan’s foreign minister, Elmar Mammadyarov, said the country’s mobile phone operators reported that Russia’s Dina Garipova came second in the local vote, which would have given her 10 points. However, when the announcement was made on live television, there were no points for Russia. Lavrov called it an 'outrageous incident' and said the points were stolen from Garipova. Garipova finished fifth overall on Saturday, 17 points behind fourth-placed Norway, so 10 points would not have made a difference in the ranking. But Russians have been passionate about the pan-European song contest for more than a decade. Dima Bilan’s win in 2008 was treated as a major national triumph. Mammadyarov said officials are investigating the incident and are now seeking access to the results of the vote. It was unclear where any mistake or vote manipulation might have occurred. Russia gave the Azerbaijani entry the maximum 12 points. Passionate: Russia feels strongly about the Eurovision Song Contest, won this year by Denmark's Emmelie de Forest (left), with Dima Bilan's win for Russia in 2008 (right) regarded as a major national triumph . There have been many complaints in recent years that voting has become a political exercise rather than one which judges the best tune. Earlier this week Germany complained it was being punished for its stance on economics in southern Europe. Germany finished 21st out of 26 and only five countries voted for their entry.","Russia's Foreign Minister demanded answers from Azerbaijani counterpart .

A cyclist whose bike was stolen was flabbergasted when bungling police stopped him from taking it back - and then let the thief ride off on it. Simon Turner, 48, spotted his bicycle chained up on a busy high street as he shopped with his six-year-old son, Giles. But after he approached a Police Community Support Officer in his home town of Maidenhead he was told not to break the lock and retrieve his stolen bike. The PCSO told him it was not his property and the crook would be able to sue him if he took it. Mr Turner was told police would monitor the area using CCTV and catch the criminal. But the next day he heard the thief had slipped through their fingers and had walked off with his bike for a second time. Two men, who could not be identified, had unlocked the bicycle and taken it away from the high street in Maidenhead, Berkshire. Mr . Turner said: 'I'm absolutely appalled. The worst thing was, when we . found the bike, we had to explain to Giles why we had to leave it and . let the thief get it. 'He was scared that maybe his bike would be stolen as well.' The father-of-one's black and burgundy Universal bicycle - which was stolen from his shed in early August - had cost him £55 second hand, and he had made various improvements. When he saw it chained up outside a McDonald's in the town centre later that month, he even offered the PCSO £5 to pay to replace the lock so that he could get his bike back. But he was advised that the thief could sue for damage. Seeing red: Frustrated Mr Turner had to sit back while the bike was pinched for a second time . He said: 'I gave details of a hidden technical modification. She looked and there it was, clearly proving it was my bike. 'I said I'd go home and get some tools and remove it but they said we couldn't remove the bike. 'They said, ""you'll be damaging the lock and it's not your property"". 'The PCSO was taking advice from another officer over the phone and was just as incredulous as I was.' Mr Turner, who runs a home tuition company, then had to sit back and wait while the police allowed the thief to get away. 'I was tempted to hang around and see who came to take it back but I was with my son and it wouldn't have been practical,' added Mr Turner, who lives with wife Anu in Maidenhead. A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'The PCSO was acting on the . advice of a colleague and we've yet to establish exactly what happened. 'However, it does appear the incorrect advice was given to her and there . were other steps that could have been taken at the time. 'We'd like to apologise for this mistake and reassure the gentleman . concerned that we are doing all we can to track down the person or . people who stole his bicycle.'

Miracle survival: Brett Archibald spent 27 hours treading water, being stung by jellyfish, nibbled by fish and pecked by sea-gulls before he was rescued . A father of two who fell overboard from a tour boat off the coast of Indonesia has been found alive after floating for 27 hours without a lifejacket. Brett Archibald, from Camps Bay, South Africa, was plucked from the Mentawai Strait sunburned and dehydrated, but otherwise in good spirits despite being lost for more than a day. His family are said to be overjoyed at his almost miraculous survival, after he managed to keep himself afloat despite drifting nearly 11 miles from where he disappeared in rough seas. The 50-year-old is now being taken to Panang, West Sumatra, for a medical assessment. But he was well enough after his rescue to speak by phone to his wife Anita back in South Africa, a Facebook page set up to support the search reported. Mr Archibald told her he had come close to drowning at least eight times during his 27-hour ordeal, as he was stung by jellyfish, had seagulls try to peck his eyes out and fish nibble at his body. He added that he now wants to complete his surfing trip before returning home, joking 'I didn't fly all that way to tread water for 27 hours.' Mr Archibald had been among ten passengers taking an overnight trip aboard the Indonesian tour boat Naga Laut from Panang to the Mentawai Islands, a popular surf spot. After becoming ill as the boat sailed rough seas he had gone to be sick over the side, where he told his wife he believes he may have passed out and fallen overboard. When he came to believing someone was splashing water in his face, then realised he was already in the wash of the Naga Laut, some 20 miles from the nearest shore, and could only watch as the vessel sailed away. It was only after he failed to turn up for breakfast that fellow passengers realised Mr Archibald was missing. As soon as the alarm was raised a massive search and rescue effort began coordinated by the Indonesian Coast Guard. Charter vessels from Padang and the Mentawais islands joined in the search for the lost man, but after more than 24 hours missing at sea little hope was held for him being found alive. Then, 27 hours after he fell overboard, at 6.30am local time, Sydney-owned cruise boat the Barrenjoey, which was in the area and which joined the searching armada, found Mr Archibald floating on his back. The Facebook page Searching For Brett Archibald republished a communique by Craig Lambinon of South Africa's National Sea Rescue Institute which said: 'Family and friends of Brett Archibald are overjoyed by news that Brett has been found alive and well, although sunburnt and dehydrated' Curl of a breaking wave in the Mentawai Islands: Mr Archibald had been among ten passengers taking an overnight trip aboard the Indonesian tour boat Naga Laut from Panang to the islands, a popular surf spot . Lost at sea: This map shows the location where Mr Archibald fell overboard from the boat he was travelling on, and the location some 11 miles away where he was finally plucked from the sea 27 hours later . Mr Lambinon added: 'Sincerest . gratitude is extended by Bretts wife Anita Archibald and the family and . friends of Brett to the crew of the motor sail boat Barrenjoey and to . all Indonesian maritime rescue services, Australian and United Kingdom . maritime rescue and the private volunteers who assisted and who were . involved in the search and rescue operation that brought this effort to a . successful conclusion...

'Anita spoke to Brett for the first time by phone at around 04h15 (South African time). 'Brett told her he had been extremely sea sick and may have passed out on the deck of NAGA LAUT while being sea-sick overboard when he woke up already in the sea behind the boat which continued away from him. No one onboard NAGA LAUT knew he had gone overboard. 'He said he came close to drowning at least 8 times during his 27 hour ordeal (swimming and drifting at sea) and that he had been stung by jelly fish, picked at by fish and seagulls had tried to pluck his eyes out. 'He has highly complimented his rescuers on Barrenjoey. He is in good spirits. 'Brett told Anita he wants to complete his surfing trip before returning home and that he didnt fly all that way to tread water for 27 hours.'

Most of the Kurdish female soldiers are young and attractive - some have been part of the Kurdish militia since they were five years old.

Many of the fighters are bands of sisters - all risking their lives to fight. In Aleppo there are two known women's brigades and both fight for the rebel side. In a further complication, Israel could get drawn in - yesterday Israeli . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that he is ready to act . if Syria attempts to ship advanced Iranian weapons to Hezbollah, saying . that 'we are prepared for every scenario.' Earlier this month, Israel struck twice near Damascus, to intercept purported shipments to Hezbollah and now Syria is making preparations to strike Tel Aviv, The Sunday Times reported. The Syrian army has begun deploying advanced surface-to-surface missiles - they are advanced Tishreen missiles which are capable of carrying a holf-ton warhead. The newspaper said that the information was obtained by reconnaissance satellites that were tracking the Syrian forces. With the regime scoring gains on the battlefield, the U.S. and Russia could face an even tougher task persuading Assad and his opponents to attend talks on ending Syria's 26-month-old conflict. Washington and Moscow hope to start talks with an international conference as early as next month, though no date has been set. Battle: One of the female snipers takes up her vantage point .

Previous . diplomatic initiatives have failed, in part because of divisions within . the international community and because the regime and the armed . opposition believed they could achieve more on the battlefield than in . talks. Russia and the U.S. have backed opposite sides in Syria. Still, . neither regime forces nor rebel fighters have been able to create . significant momentum since the uprising against Assad erupted in March . 2011 and last year escalated into a full-fledged civil war. The rebels control large rural areas . in the north and east of the country, while Assad has successfully . defended his hold on the capital, Damascus, the coastal area and parts . of Aleppo, Syria's largest city. Before . Sunday's offensive, Qusair had been ringed by regime troops and . fighters from the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, an Assad ally, for several . weeks.

Hezbollah fighters began shelling the town late Saturday, followed by . airstrikes early Sunday that sent residents taking cover in basements. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group, said warplanes resumed bombing raids later Sunday. By Sunday afternoon, regime forces . had advanced into the town, engaging in house-to-house battles with . rebel fighters, Abdullah said. Syrian . state media said Assad's troops took control of the main square, the . area around the municipal building, a sports stadium and a local church. Syrian state TV said troops arrested rebel fighters who tried to flee . Qusair dressed as civilians. A . government official said the regime left an escape road open to . civilians, a claim denied by Abdullah, who said thousands of . noncombatants were trapped in Qusair. 'We tried to get civilians out . four times. They are not allowing us,' he said of regime forces. The Observatory said 52 people were killed in Qusair, including 48 fighters, three women and a male civilian. Rejections: Government forces launched the offensive on the town of Qusair just hours after Assad said in a newspaper interview that he'll stay in his job until elections - effectively rejecting an opposition demand that any talks on a political transition lead to his ouster . Even though the regime and the main opposition group have not yet committed to attending the conference, U.N.

The . main political opposition group, the Syrian National Coalition, said . some 40,000 civilians are currently in Qusair and expressed concern for . their safety. It urged the international community to step in to protect . the lives of the civilians and called on the U.N. Security Council to . denounce Hezbollah's involvement in the attack. Six mortar rounds, apparently fired . from Qusair, struck in nearby Lebanon, causing damage to a carpentry . shop where a fire broke out, Lebanese security officials said. There . were no reports of casualties. In . the northern Lebanese port city of Tripoli, clashes erupted between . residents of a predominantly Alawite area and a majority Sunni . neighborhood, Lebanon's National News Agency reported. It said at least . five people were wounded in the fighting. Events in Syria often raise tension among rival sects in neighboring Lebanon, particularly in Tripoli. The Qusair offensive was just the latest indicator that the joint U.S.-Russian diplomatic initiative faces challenges. Breaking point: Damaged buildings are seen in Homs. Oxfam aid agency warned that Jordan and Lebanon were in urgent need of help to support hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees . Toll: The Observatory said 52 people were killed in Qusair, including 48 fighters, three women and a male civilian . Russia, despite its stated commitment to Syria peace talks, has reportedly delivered an advanced version of its Yakhont anti-ship cruise missiles to Syria, prompting U.S. complaints last week about an 'ill-timed' step. Russia is a key political ally and arms supplier of the Assad regime, along with Iran. The Obama administration, meanwhile, wants to avoid getting drawn into the Syria quagmire, despite pressure to find a way to end the bloodletting that has left more than 70,000 dead. U.S. concerns have been heightened by the growing dominance of Islamic militants among the fighters, including those linked to the al-Qaida terror network. 'For the U.S., (the conference) is mostly about postponing the tough decision-making Obama has been loath to get himself involved in, because he fears Syria will suck him in,' said Peter Harling, a Syria expert at the International Crisis Group think tank. Meanwhile an international aid organization is appealing for more funds to help Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan, saying warmer weather will increase health risks due to lack of shelter, water and basic sanitation. Oxfam says it needs  £34million ($53 million) to improve access to water and proper sanitation for Syrian refugees. The Britain-based group said in a statement that diarrhea and skin infections have already been noted among refugees in Jordan and Lebanon. More than 100 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis, also known as the Aleppo boil, have been diagnosed in private clinics in the past two weeks. If left untreated, the festering boil, can grow to a weeping wound several centimetres in diameter. It is caused by a single-cell parasite that is transmitted by sandfly. Access to medicine, clean water and good hygiene practices are critical to help treat these infections. The two countries host the bulk of 1.5 million Syrians who have fled the civil war at home, seeking shelter in neighboring countries. Oxfam says it needs the funds quickly as temperatures are expected to soar in the region in the coming weeks.","Assad strengthening grip on a strategic strip of land near Lebanese border .

A Somali paedophile has been given thousands of pounds by a human rights court – and released on to the streets. Ministers have spent more than a decade trying and failing to deport Mustafa Abdi, who is thought to have cost taxpayers more than £600,000 in jail costs and legal aid. But yesterday Strasbourg judges ordered the British government to pay the convicted child rapist thousands of pounds in damages and legal costs. Human rights: The court in Strasbourg found that the decision to re-detain Abdi in 2008 was not lawful because the required reviews weren't carried out . The court said Abdi was ‘wrongfully detained’ for two and a half years, breaching his right to liberty. Ministers had decided he should . remain in jail while awaiting deportation because he presented a ‘high . risk’ to the public. But it emerged he was released from prison in . January this year because there was no prospect of him being deported . any time soon. He has spent around 13 years in jail and received tens of thousands of pounds in legal aid to help him thwart deportation. Last night Home Office officials were . still insisting they would ‘continue to seek to deport’ him – despite . having failed to do so since 2002. Abdi, who was born in 1975, arrived . in Britain in May 1995. His asylum claim was rejected, but he was given . leave to remain in Britain until February 2000. Unlawful: The court ordered the Government to pay Abdi, who is being held at HMP Brixton (pictured), £1,277 in damages, and a further £5,960 to cover legal costs . In 1998 he was convicted of rape and indecency with a child and sentenced to eight years in prison. In May 2002 David Blunkett, then Home Secretary, ordered his deportation – but Abdi made the first of several appeals. While in prison he was assessed as . presenting a ‘high risk’ of sexual offending if let out. As a result he . was detained after his sentence was completed while ministers tried to . deport him. They were thwarted because no airline . was prepared to fly him, or any other Somali nationals, back home . against their will. Abdi refused to return home voluntarily. In September 2006 he was given permission to apply for a judicial review of the decision to keep him behind bars. He won his initial case, but the . Court of Appeal ruled that his detention between December 2004 and June . 2006 was lawful because he could have returned to Somalia voluntarily. He was let out in April 2007 but arrested again a year later after . breaching his bail conditions by failing to report to police. Ministers struggle to return Somali . nationals home, even those convicted of heinous crimes, because of . another ruling by the European Court of Human Rights. Yesterday the same court overturned . the British court’s ruling and said his detention was unlawful because . regular case reviews did not take place. The Strasbourg judges ordered the . Government to pay £1,277 (1,500 euros) in damages and £5,960 (7,000 . euros) for legal costs and expenses. It is thought he has received . between £20,000 and £30,000 in legal aid in Britain, while taxpayers . have also had to cough up £45,000 a year for jail costs. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We are extremely disappointed with the court’s decision and are urgently reviewing our options. ‘We will continue to seek to deport this individual who has shown a complete disregard for the laws of this country. ‘We believe it is right that dangerous individuals are kept in detention, wherever possible, in order to protect the public.’","Mustafa Abdi was jailed in 1998 for rape and indecency with a child .
