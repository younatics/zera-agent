"The New York Police Department has procured two pair of Google Glass specs, the experimental head-mounted computers, to determine possible applications to police work, the department said in a statement. The technology feeds information directly to the eye-line of the wearer, potentially saving officers time from having to stop what they're doing in order to reach for a radio, smartphone, tablet or computer. ""As part of an ongoing interest in the advancements in the field of technology, the NYPD regularly conducts reviews of various equipment, devices, programs and other consumer products for their potential application or utility in the area of policing,"" Deputy Commissioner Stephen Davis said in a statement. ""In December of 2013, the Department obtained two pairs of Google Glass and has been evaluating these devices in an attempt to determine any possible useful applications,"" he said. ""The devices have not been deployed in any actual field or patrol operations, but rather are being assessed as to how they may be appropriately utilized or incorporated into any existing technology-based functions."" The devices are already being used in other areas of public safety. Patrick Jackson, a computer-savvy firefighter in North Carolina, has developed a Google Glass app that he hopes to expand to include useful data such as information on specific buildings -- blueprints, potential building hazards and contact information for owners. A firefighter might be able to say an address out loud or simply look at a building with the Glass camera to retrieve information. Other fire departments across the United States have expressed interest in Jackson's app. One hopes to link a thermal imaging camera to Glass customized to work with oxygen masks, giving firefighters partial vision through smoke and darkness. Glass can also record the first video when fire crews arrive in order to assist in investigations. Similarly, the device could potentially provide law enforcement officers instant information about suspects or be used to record audio and video of interactions with the public. The ability of Google Glass to snap photos and record video and audio has raised privacy concerns. Google Glass, worn like regular glasses, has a high-resolution display and lets wearers use voice commands to access features like e-mail, text messaging, Google Maps, Google search and a handful of other apps. The high-tech specs are not on the market yet and are available only through the Google's Glass Explorer Program, which allows organizations or individuals to test the glasses for $1,500, according to Google's website.","NYPD experiments with two pair of Google Glass specs .

"Vice President Joe Biden has apologized to President Barack Obama for putting him in a tough position that led to Obama's announcement that he now supports same-sex marriage, senior administration officials said Thursday. Obama said in an interview that aired Thursday on ABC that he made his decision public earlier than he had planned after Biden's weekend remark that he was ""absolutely comfortable"" with letting gays and lesbians marry. Two senior administration officials said Biden and Obama met Wednesday morning, and Biden apologized for putting Obama in a tough spot. Obama responded by saying that he knew Biden was speaking from the heart, said the officials, who didn't want to be named discussing private conversations between the president and vice president. Biden's remarks on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday launched a controversy that led to Obama announcing that his position on same-sex marriage, which he had previously called ""evolving,"" had shifted to support. When Obama's full interview aired Thursday, he said his disclosure came sooner than planned as a result of Biden's comments. ""I had already made a decision that we were going to probably take this position before the election and before the convention,"" Obama said on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" Biden ""probably got out a little bit over his skis, but out of generosity of spirit,"" he said. He added that he would have ""preferred to have done this in my own way, on my own terms,"" but ""all's well that ends well."" Separately, Biden spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff said Obama ""has been the leader on this issue from day one, and the vice president never intended to distract from that."" Once Biden's comments drew attention to the issue, Obama made plans to announce his support next week on a previously scheduled appearance on the ABC talk show ""The View,"" a senior administration official said Thursday. The president and his advisers knew Obama would be asked about the issue in the wake of Biden's NBC interview, said the official, who didn't want to speak publicly about internal administration discussions. Ultimately, they decided to move up the timeline and have him announce his support during the ABC interview at the White House, the official said. And a top Democrat told CNN that Obama knew the issue would come up at the convention, partly because of a push for support for same-sex marriage to be included in the Democratic Party platform, and in debates. Multiple top Democrats told CNN the president's senior aides are annoyed with Biden for forcing the conversation on same-sex marriage now. One source said Biden has, in the past, counseled the president against coming out for same-sex marriage, making this move that much more frustrating. But the sources said they don't believe it will create a lasting rift between the two leaders. Biden is known to go off-script, something Obama knew when he selected his vice president. In explaining to ABC how his position has evolved, Obama noted that his daughters Malia and Sasha have ""friends whose parents are same-sex couples. It wouldn't dawn on them that somehow their friends' parents would be treated differently. And frankly that's the kind of thing that prompts a change of perspective, not wanting to somehow explain to your child why somebody should be treated differently when it comes to the eyes of the law."" Asked about whether his new position is a calculated move in an election year, Obama said it would ""be hard to argue that somehow this is something that I'd be doing for political advantage. Because frankly, you know, the politics -- it's not clear how they cut."" The interview aired the same day Obama attended a fundraiser in Los Angeles, where support for same-sex marriage is strong. Movie star George Clooney hosted the event, which is raking in $15 million, according to a top Democratic source. And on Monday, openly gay singer Ricky Martin is hosting a fundraising event for Obama in New York. But some in the African-American community have expressed strong disapproval of Obama's endorsement of same-sex marriage. A Democratic official said the White House has been actively reaching out to African-American community leaders and pastors and will continue to do so in the wake of the president's decision, but the official noted that even the president's base won't always agree with him on everything. ""There are going to be issues you don't agree on,"" the official said. And Obama told ABC he won't spend much time talking about the issue, because he's focused on the economy. The announcement puts Obama squarely at odds with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who has since reiterated his opposition to same-sex marriage. ""And I do not favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name,"" Romney said during a Wednesday visit to Fort Lupton, Colorado. ""My view is the domestic partnership benefits, hospital visitation rights and the like are appropriate, but that the others are not."" The issue is a divisive one in American politics, but it's uncertain how the development might play out at the voting booth. A Gallup Poll released Tuesday indicated 50% of Americans believe same-sex marriages should be recognized by law as valid, with 48% saying such marriages should not be legal -- a dramatic shift from a few years ago. A Gallup poll in 2009 found 40% supported same-sex marriage and 57% were opposed. But a CNN/ORC International poll, taken in late March, indicated policies toward gays and lesbians were tied for last in people's opinions of the most-important issues facing the country. Obama said he supports states deciding the issue on their own, but added that he was ""disappointed"" by Tuesday's vote on the issue in North Carolina, where a ban on same-sex marriage was added to the constitution. Obama called the amendment discriminatory against gays and lesbians, a spokesman said earlier Wednesday. Six states -- Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York -- and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, while 31 states have voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to defend traditional definitions of marriage as a heterosexual union. In February, Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire signed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage beginning in June, but opponents there have pledged to block the bill and called for voters to decide the issue. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley signed into law a bill that permits the state's same-sex couples to wed as of January 1, and state residents may vote to affirm such a law. Minnesota will vote on a state constitutional amendment similar to the one in North Carolina, while Maine will have a referendum on allowing same-sex marriage. Meanwhile, two cases seeking to overturn laws forbidding the practice, one from California and another from Massachusetts, could be headed to the U.S. Supreme Court in coming months.","Senior officials say Biden apologized to Obama on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- It was just a joke, said Pat Sajak -- but a lot of Twitter followers weren't laughing. On Monday night, the ""Wheel of Fortune"" host -- a conservative who's occasionally used his Twitter account to tweak liberals -- tweeted, ""I now believe global warming alarmists are unpatriotic racists knowingly misleading for their own ends. Good night."" The reaction from the Twitterverse was swift and blunt. Some tried reason. Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State, tweeted that climate change could have huge repercussions.

""Sometimes it's fun to poke a stick in a hornets' nest just to hear the buzzing,"" he tweeted Tuesday afternoon. In a statement, Sajak said he was just being snarky. ""Of course I was joking. Just mocking the name-calling that is directed at global warming skeptics within and without the scientific community,"" he said in a statement from his representative. As Vice magazine noted, Sajak has a habit of mocking climate change. He's tweeted about Al Gore, fund-raising and his nephew being a ""Tooth Fairy denier.""

"Have you been pining for your very own wearable $1,500 Google Glass but weren't sure how you, a regular nondeveloper residing in the United States, could procure one? Tuesday will be your lucky day. Google is opening sales of Glass for one day only to any adult in the United States who wants one of the devices. In true sale fashion, Google is throwing in free frames or sunglasses for those first-time customers and the supply is limited. Sales start at 9 a.m. ET on April 15, but people can sign up now with Google to receive a reminder. This is the first time the device has been available to the general public. So far, the face-mounted computers have  been sold only to Google ""Explorers,"" the company's name for early adopters. At first only developers could buy Glass, but Google slowly expanded the program to include regular people. Some were hand-picked, others applied to be Explorers through Google contests by sharing what cool projects they would do if they had Glass. In the year since Google Glass was first shipped, it has been lauded as the future of computing, criticized for hastening the death of privacy, and mocked for looking silly. People wearing Glass have been banned from bars and restaurants, given tickets for distracted driving, and dubbed ""Glassholes."" It's been a busy year. Glass mounts on a pair of compatible glasses and positions a small display above the wearer's right eye. The wearer uses Glass to access the Internet and can simply look up to see things like directions, notifications and content from custom Glass apps on the screen. It is controlled by voice or using the tiny touch pad on the side. The device's most controversial feature is a small camera that can record 720p video or snap still photos. There's no indicator light showing when the camera is on, though Glass wearers say the display lights up, so it's not a secret. Google and Explorers say that more education and exposure is needed to dispel privacy fears and for the technology to be embraced by the general public. This one-day sale could lead to a lot more people donning the devices. We'll have to see if that helps or hurts the Google Glass cause.","Google opening sales of Google Glass to the general public on April 15 .

"For the first time ever, Apple unveiled two new iPhones on Tuesday, a traditional upgrade of its iPhone 5 as well as a simpler, cheaper version. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C are a reaction to a changing smartphone market. ""Business has become so large that this year we are going to replace the iPhone 5 and we're going to replace it with not one, but two new designs,"" Cook said. ""This allows us to serve even more customers."" The iPhone 5C was the first phone demoed at Tuesday's event at Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters. ""It has an incredible all new design, one that's more fun, more colorful than any iPhone we've made yet,"" said Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president for marketing. In a video, Apple design guru Jonny Ive described the 5C as ""beautifully, unapologetically plastic."" The phone will sell for as little as $99, for a 16GB version, and $199 for one with 32GB of storage (each with a two-year mobile contract). In a departure, Apple will also be making its own cases for the 5C, selling them in a variety of colors for $29. Then there's the iPhone 5S, which is the more traditional update to the iPhone 5. ""It is the gold standard in smartphones,"" Schiller said. The 5S features a handful of performance upgrades, including what Apple calls a dramatic increase in processing speed. It will have the first 64-bit chip in a smartphone -- Apple's A7 -- which Schiller said has tested at up to twice as fast as the iPhone 5's processor. It also will have a new feature, a motion co-processor, that will let the phone be used as a fitness tracker along the lines of a FitBit. Schiller said battery life will be ""the same or better"" than the iPhone 5 and its camera will have 15% more active sensor space, improved white balance and auto-focus, and a new flash. Also, its camera will, for the first time on iPhone, allow video in slow motion. Arguably the most dramatic new feature on the phone, though, is Touch ID, a fingerprint scanner for added security. Users will be able to log into their phone via the home button and make purchases from iTunes using their fingerprint as a password of sorts. The iPhone 5S will sell for $199 for a 16GB version, $299 for a 32GB model and $399 for the top-end 64GB phone. Pre-orders for the iPhone 5C starts on September 13. Both versions are on sale starting September 20. Cook also announced the newest version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 7, will be released to the public on September 18. It will have over 200 new features, according to Apple, including the ability to switch voice-activated digital assistant Siri to a male voice. The iPhone has remained the world's top-selling smartphone, save for a few quarters when it was dethroned by phones in Samsung's Galaxy S line. But after making up nearly 24% of all smartphones sold in late 2011, Apple's device is now down to about 14%, while Android phones account for a whopping 79%. With the iPhone 5C, Apple is clearly looking to emerging markets like China and India, where a less expensive phone would, presumably, sell well to a massive potential customer base. Historically, rollouts of new Apple products have been near-mystical affairs for fans. But as the smartphone market has matured, some analysts say the real excitement may need to come from other products. ""Apple needs a new 'hero product,' but I do not think it necessarily has to be a phone,"" Gartner technology analyst Carolina Milanesi told CNN. ""With technology innovation slowing down, maybe they are better off turning iPhone into a market-share grabber and showing innovation in another product."" A likely candidate could be the company's anticipated ""iWatch."" Apple is all but certain to join the emerging smartwatch market that Samsung entered last week with its Galaxy Gear device. Also, Apple has also long been rumored to be working on a TV set.","Apple rolls out two new iPhones Tuesday .

"Bruce Davis -- a former associate of Charles Manson and a convicted murderer himself -- was granted parole Wednesday in California, the state Department of Corrections said, though that doesn't mean he'll necessarily become a free man. Davis was sent to state prison on April 21, 1972, for the first-degree murders of musician Gary Hinman and stuntman Donald ""Shorty"" Shea in 1969. He was given a life sentence. The corrections department's Board of Parole Hearings granted parole for the 71-year-old Davis following his 28th parole suitability hearing on Wednesday. But the board's decision is not the end of the case. There's a 120-day internal review period. When that's done, Gov. Jerry Brown will have 30 days more to nullify or modify the decision -- meaning that, if everything goes his way, Davis could still be looking at another four months behind bars. In fact, there's precedent for him not to be released. Twice, Davis has gotten an initial victory only to have his hopes of getting out dashed. In January 2010 and October 2012, the parole board granted him parole. In the second case, the board explained it made such a recommendation because of Davis'  ""positive adjustment, record of no recent disciplinary problems, and for successfully completing academic and vocational education and self-help programs."" Both times, the sitting governors -- first Arnold Schwarzenegger and later Brown -- reversed that decision. ""When considered as a whole, I find the evidence ... shows why he currently poses a danger to society if released from prison,"" Brown wrote in 2013 to explain his reversal. If this time proves different, Davis would become the first Manson ""family"" member to be freed solely for good behavior. The group's gruesome killings inspired the best-selling book ""Helter Skelter"" and made their undisputed ringleader Manson a cult figure. The 1969 spree ensnared several victims, including 8-months-pregnant actress Sharon Tate. Manson is serving a life sentence for his role in nine murders. He was denied parole for the 12th time in 2012; his next such hearing is set for 2027, at which time he'd be 92 years old. LAPD hopes decades-old tapes hold clues to Manson murder mystery .

"Just days after dismissing two top advisers for their roles in the George Washington Bridge scandal, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie faced questions over the use of Superstorm Sandy relief funds. CNN has learned that federal officials are investigating whether Christie improperly used some of that money to produce tourism ads that starred him and his family. The news couldn't come at a worse time for the embattled Republican, who is facing two probes in New Jersey of whether his staff orchestrated traffic gridlock near the country's busiest bridge to punish a Democratic mayor who refused to endorse his re-election. N.J. Democratic legislator: 'I do believe laws have been broken' If the Sandy inquiry by a watchdog finds any wrongdoing, it could prove even more damaging to Christie's national ambitions. He's considered a possible presidential candidate in 2016. His performance during and after the October 2012 storm just before the presidential election has been widely praised and is a fundamental illustration of his straight-shooting political brand. In the new investigation, federal auditors will examine New Jersey's use of $25 million in Sandy relief funds for a marketing campaign to promote tourism at the Jersey Shore, New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone told CNN . In an August letter, Pallone asked the Department of Housing and Urban Development inspector general to look into how Christie chose to spend the marketing money approved by the department. The inspector general's office confirmed the investigation. Documents: Christie aides stonewalled queries into lane closings . Pallone wrote that he was concerned  about the bidding process for the firm awarded the marketing plan; the winning firm is charging the state about $2 million more than the next lowest bidder. The winning bid of $4.7 million featured Christie and his family in the advertisements while the losing $2.5 million proposal did not feature the Christies, Pallone said. On Sunday, Pallone told CNN that the inspector general conducted a preliminary review  and concluded there was enough evidence to launch a full-scale investigation into the state's use of federal funds. The audit will take several months and the findings will be issued in an official report, he said. Pallone, a 27-year veteran of the House and vocal Christie critic, said this is not about politics. ""This was money that could have directly been used for Sandy recovery. And, as you know, many of my constituents still haven't gotten the money that is owed them to rebuild their homes or raise their homes or to help,"" he said. Legal woes lurk for Christie over bridge traffic jam . Democrats slammed Christie over the summer for starring in taxpayer-funded ads as he was running for re-election in November, arguing it gave him an unfair advantage. Christie aides said at the time that the winning bid provided more value. In a statement on Monday, Christie's office said the ""Stronger than the Storm"" campaign was part of an ""action plan"" approved by the Obama administration and developed with the goal of showing that the New Jersey shore was open for business just several months after the storm. ""Federal agency reviews are routine and standard operating procedure with all federally allocated resources to ensure that funds are distributed fairly. We're confident that any review will show that the ads were a key part in helping New Jersey get back on its feet after being struck by the worst storm in state history,"" according to the statement issued in response to questions from CNN. Last week, Christie dismissed two top aides for their apparent involvement in the closure of access lanes to the George Washington Bridge, which caused traffic nightmares for days in and around Fort Lee. New Jersey legislators are investigating whether the aides -- a senior Christie staffer and a high-level appointee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- ordered the lane closures as political retribution. The U.S. Attorney in New Jersey also is looking into the matter. Christie has said he didn't know about the alleged scheme and was ""embarrassed and humiliated"" by it. Democrats in New Jersey and nationally have jumped on the scandal, saying it gives the nation a chance to see what they've said for years -- that Christie is a bully who governs by fear. His supporters say his swagger and frank nature convey confidence and have helped make him a successful governor. But as bad as the bridge scandal is for Christie, any finding that he improperly spent Sandy aid would tarnish the signature achievement that has helped elevate his legacy and made him a serious potential challenger for the White House. Sandy, a historic storm, pummeled coastal areas along the mid-Atlantic, knocking out power to millions, causing massive flooding and killing more than 100 people in the United States. Parts of the New Jersey shore were devastated, but the state and local communities in many hard-hit areas rebounded surprisingly quickly and reopened their beaches last summer. Christie and President Barack Obama toured one community in May to demonstrate the effectiveness of recovery efforts helped by billions in federal money that went to New Jersey and other states affected by the storm.","Christie and his family starred in ads for New Jersey tourism after Sandy .

"California Gov. Jerry Brown has reversed a parole board decision and denied the release of Bruce Davis -- a former associate of Charles Manson and a convicted murderer himself. ""I find the evidence shows that he currently poses an unreasonable danger to society if released from prison,"" Brown said in his decision released Friday night.  ""Therefore, I reverse the decision to  parole Davis."" Davis was sent to state prison for life on April 21, 1972, for the first-degree murders of musician Gary Hinman and stuntman Donald ""Shorty"" Shea in 1969. In March, the state Board of Parole Hearings granted parole for the 71-year-old Davis following his 28th parole suitability hearing. Brown had up to 150 days to nullify or modify the decision. In reversing the board, Brown cited the viciousness of the killing. ""The exceptional brutality of these crimes and the terror the Manson Family inflicted on the Los Angeles community 45 years ago still resonate,"" he said. It is the third time a California governor has refused to release Davis. In January 2010 and October 2012, the parole board granted him parole. In the second case, the board explained it made such a recommendation because of Davis'  ""positive adjustment, record of no recent disciplinary problems, and for successfully completing academic and vocational education and self-help programs.""

"(CNN)It has been described as Ben Hur on snow. Twelve horses line up in a start gate but the race is far from conventional. The race track is a snow-covered frozen lake and attached to each horse is a skier. It is akin to human chariot racing as riders hit speeds of 50km/h jostling for position and, ultimately, victory. The sport of skijoring has a long and rich history. And Franco Moro and the Swiss ski resort of St Moritz have been a part of the White Turf event for over three decades. With its often combative nature, it is no wonder Moro likens the sport to the 1959 film starring Charlton Heston. ""Skijoring is just something that people want to see,"" he says. ""It's like Ben Hur on snow, the modern way. I love the speed, the adrenalin rush is something special. It's just unique."" Skijoring comes from the Norwegian word skikjøring, which literally translates as ski driving, and is thought to date back to the 14th Century. In St Moritz, the sport began in 1906 and was even a display sport at the 1928 Winter Olympics. When it first began, participants set off at one-minute intervals over a 10-kilometer stretch. But after it was switched to a makeshift racecourse, the race now consists of two laps covering a distance of 2,700 meters. There is no doubting the precarious nature of the sport. At one notorious race in 1965, not a single entrant finished. And at the last race, during the notoriously challenging start where jockeys aim to avoid getting their ropes tangled, Moro says: ""One jockey crashed his head and lost a few minutes with a loss of consciousness."" Some 10,000 people flock to each race in the Swiss Alps, creating a party atmosphere for the only three events of the year held each February. The overall victor is crowned ""King of Engadine,"" so called after the valley where the racing takes place. Moro, who has been skijoring for 31 years and has no qualms about nudging horses out of his in a bid for on-track supremacy, was crowned king on Sunday. The 55-year-old could only finish fifth in the third and final race of the three-week series, but two previous wins towed by the horse Dreamspeed proved sufficient for another title. His family ran a horse-carriage business, so skijoring allies one passion with another. His day job is as the director of St Moritz Ski School. And having stumbled on the sport in the first place, he says: ""Skijoring is something you can't forget. Maybe we're a little bit crazy, I don't know."" There are obvious dangers to the sport, not least wrestling with reins and ropes in a melee of horses and drivers at the start. ""You get very close to the other horses, it's like a sandwich and it's a bit dangerous,"" he explained. ""You have horses in front and behind and the danger is someone can stand on your ski."" Amazingly, though, Moro has never had a major accident in his time in the sport and is pleased to point out there have been no deaths during his era. Although there have been a litany of injuries to others, ""nothing too bad, broken arms and legs,"" he adds matter-of-factly. It's not just in Switzerland where skijoring has taken hold, variations of the sport can entail people being driven by dogs or even motor vehicles. In the United States, it generally involves jockeyed horses pulling skiers along by a rope -- catching hoops and tackling jumps along the course. For Scott Ping, president of the North American Ski Joring Association, which hosts its own World Championships at the end of January each year in front of 4,000 spectators, the sport almost cost him his life. Ping does not ski -- he rides the horses instead -- but became precariously unstuck while training for one particular competition. ""I was running my horse through ice and snow when it broke through the ground and half a ton of horse came down on me,"" he recalled. ""It all happened in slow motion. ""I heard my neck break, I heard it crack like a gun going off."" With his head planted, he couldn't move. He was trapped in the snow, with just enough room to breathe in a gap under his chin. He had broken the C1 and C2 vertebrae in his neck and was now alone as his horse headed back to the barn. ""I was getting very anxious that this was where I was going to die,"" he said. But eventually he regained sufficient movement in his arm to telephone for help and was in an ambulance 20 minutes later. Two hours later he was moving his toes and, defying the doctors, he was walking within two days. ""The doctor said one tenth of 1% of people that have that injury live and one tenth of that number walk again. I'm walking."" Despite the horrific nature of his injuries four years ago he returned to skijoring only to fall again and break eight ribs leading to a longer hiatus from the sport, which ended two years ago. For him, it is a drug he just cannot give up: ""It's a lot of fun, it's a kick. I don't think there's any sport to compare to it. It's an unusual combination of old cowboys and skiers getting together to make a big run. When I compete, the adrenalin is just unbelievable."" As for the wider appeal, he jokes: ""The silly story is that some guys got together to have a combination of who the best horseman is, the best skier and the best drinker, and this combines all three!"" So what exactly makes a good skijoring competitor? Moro, who like his fellow riders has to take an exam in order to be eligible to compete, explains: ""First it is experience, and knowing what can happen in a race so you can react when something goes wrong. ""You have to be a very good skier and you have to have the feeling of the horse. You need to be a team. Often these are horses you don't know so they need to get an immediate confidence from you."" Edging into his 2015 season finale, Moro continues to master that triumvirate in what is perhaps the purest form of horsepower.","Skijoring is akin to human chariot racing as horses tow racers on skis behind them .

"A jury has acquitted two former Fullerton, California, police officers on trial in the beating death of Kelly Thomas, a mentally ill and homeless man. The verdict was read in a Santa Ana courtroom Monday afternoon. Eight women and four men began deliberating the case on Thursday. ""I'm just horrified. They got away with murdering my son,"" Cathy Thomas, the victim's mother, told reporters after the verdict was read. The victim's father, Ron Thomas, said that everyone now needs to be afraid. ""This is carte blanche to police officers to do whatever they want,"" he told reporters. The beating of Thomas in a transit parking lot was recorded by security cameras on the night of July 5, 2011. The surveillance camera footage shows Thomas being beaten, clubbed and stunned with a Taser by police. The video sparked a nationwide outcry. Former officer Manuel Ramos was charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. A second former Fullerton officer, Jay Cicinelli, was charged with involuntary manslaughter and excessive use of force. Both were found not guilty on all charges. ""These peace officers were doing their job. They had no malice in their heart,"" said John Barnett, an attorney for Ramos. When asked about the video, he said it's ""not the entire case."" In closing arguments, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas told jurors that Ramos bore responsibility for Thomas's death because he issued a threat to the uncooperative homeless man. Ramos can be seen on the surveillance video putting on gloves and shaking his fist in Thomas' face.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- It was a photo shoot that caught India's attention. Five courageous survivors of acid attacks posed for portraits. In a country where victims of such attacks do not dare to come out of hiding, or show their disfigured faces in public, this was a ""ground breaking"" photo shoot, participants said. ""After the acid attack I never took photos,"" Rupa, one of the models and a survivor said. ""When the photos got circulated in the media, people started calling to inquire about me, I felt so good. After the photo shoot I want to go out meet more people."" Rupa, now 22, was 15 years old when she was attacked by her stepmother following a dispute about money. ""That night, after acid was poured on my face, I could not see anything. I could not open my eyes, I was screaming,"" she said. ""But no one came to help me. My stepmother watched me suffering."" After that night, everything changed. ""My studies stopped, I stopped playing."" It was only three years after the acid attack that Rupa gathered enough courage to look at her face in the mirror. It was her childhood dream, to be a designer and Rupa designed the outfits for all the models featured on the photo shoot including herself. The photos were first published on Facebook page run by Stop Acid Attacks, an organization raising awareness about the plight of acid attack victims but have since been featured extensively across the world. Her next step is to open a boutique. Currently she is living in Chhanv, a rehabilitation center for acid attack victims opened by the charity. New law . In 2013, the Indian Supreme Court passed laws aiming to control over-the-counter sales of acid. But the implementation has been poor though, said Alok Dixit, founder of Stop Acid Attacks. ""Yes, the law is on paper, but you can find acid easily in local markets,"" he said. ""We need the government to be active in enforcing the law to regulate acid sales."" According to the group, more than 200 acid attack cases have been reported since January 2013. But activists including Alok believe the real number is much higher. Lacking support from family and society, many victims do not report attacks to the police. Fearing social stigma, many do not even show their face in public. And that is what the group wanted the photo shoot to change. ""We want the acid attack survivors to come out of hiding and tell their stories. It is okay to show your face,"" Alok said. Changing perceptions . Rahul Saharan, a professional photographer, was the man behind the camera. He wanted to showcase Rupa's designs and help her motivate other fellow acid attack survivors across the world. His second goal: make the victims feel beautiful and change the way people define ""beauty"" in general. ""In our society, there are lots of things said to the girls -- you are not beautiful, you won't get married because your skin is not white and fair,"" Rahul said. ""I want to change the perception of beauty -- tell people that the real beauty is not about having a fair skin. ""When you see pictures used in commercials, you just see and forget them after sometime, but when you see these pictures, you feel in love with them. You want to look at them again and again."" Ritu, another acid attack victim and a participant of the photo shoot, was 17 when acid was thrown at her face. She is 19 now and going through treatment. She cannot see with her left eye. ""Every acid attack survivor says they do not want to meet the attackers,"" she said. ""But I want to meet the guy (who did this to me) and ask: 'was it worth it?'""

"Marc Marquez continued his record breaking 2014 MotoGP season with a 10th straight win Sunday to match the feat of Australian Mick Doohan in 1997. The reigning world champion has proved all-conquering on his Repsol Honda but was pushed all the way in Indianapolis by Yamaha pair Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi, who occupied the other podium positions. Rossi briefly led before slipping back to the third place, but the points saw him become the first man to top 4,000 in MotoGP. ""It was a good start though as I was able to lead. I tried to push to the limit to stay with Marc but he got past. I would have hoped to have a bit of a better battle with Lorenzo. But I am satisfied."" the Italian legend told the official MotoGP website. Marquez took the lead on lap 11 as he found his way past the Yamaha pair and eventually finished two seconds clear by the finish. His teammate Dani Pedrosa finished fourth as he came through from eighth. Pol Espargaro (Monster Yamaha Tech3) took a fine fifth with his British teammate Bradley Smith in sixth after a heavy crash in Saturday practice. Smith's compatriot Cal Crutchlow (Ducati) was seventh with his teammate Andrea Dovizioso in eighth. But it was Marquez again who took the plaudits to continue his remarkable run and he is already looking to the next round in Brno in the Czech Republic. ""The race was very hard, especially as the track temperature was very high. I struggled a little with the front tyre so I stayed behind Rossi to try to keep the front tire cool,""he said. He added, ""We will try to fight for the victory in Brno. The test we had went well but it was very slippery so we don't have too much data. I have never gone great there and Jorge and Vale are very strong there.""","Marc Marquez wins MotoGP round at Indianapolis .

"(CNN)Abu Mohamad just wanted to sell some pizza. An electrician-turned-entrepreneur, he knew his upstart pizza parlor needed a kick. So Abu Mohamad came up with the idea of using bikes to bring his customers their margarita, za'atar and mince pies. ""We had to adapt,"" he said. It's not just about coming up with business innovations or delivery options. Thinking outside the box becomes a necessity when you're essentially living in boxes like Abu Mohamad and more than 83,000 others like him, who fled their homes in war-ravaged Syria and settled across the border in northern Jordan's Zaatari refugee camp. The camp began in July 2012 as a small patch of tents for scared and worn Syrians. As the refugees' numbers grew, their perspectives changed. The civil war in their homeland wasn't going away anytime soon, and neither were they. So these resilient Syrians went to work. For men like Abu Mohamad, who, like other refugees, prefers not to be identified by his full name, there wasn't much choice but to adjust to their new lives, new livelihoods and new ways of doing things. ""I couldn't sit and wait for the situation to change,"" said Abu Mohamad. ""We always want more for our families."" INTERACTIVE MAP: Syrians turn Zaatari into a home . They've gotten it. Abu Mohamad's business is booming, with up to 50 deliveries a day to humanitarian workers, government officials and fellow refugees. And in many ways, Zataari -- their new home -- is thriving as well. Almost anything is better than what they left behind. Syria's civil war has been raging since 2011, when a government crackdown on protests in Daraa spiraled into a full-blown armed conflict. Few areas have been spared by gunfire, bombing, airstrikes, even reported chemical attacks. The violence comes not just from troops loyal to President Bashar al-Assad -- who has been criticized and isolated by much of the world -- but a number of rebel groups, some of them considered moderates and others extremists, like the al Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front and ISIS. The impact on civilians has been horrific. Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations special envoy for Syria, reported in January that some 220,000 people had been killed and 1 million wounded. Some 7.6 million have been displaced because of the fighting, with the return of polio, typhoid and measles to Syria symptomatic of the health crisis there. The war has also produced 3.3 million refugees, most of whom ended up in camps in Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan. At least in Zaatari -- which, within its packed 1.3 square miles, is already one of the world's largest refugee camps and ranks as Jordan's fourth largest city, according to the United Nations -- refugees have taken matters into their own hands by transforming their new home. ""They realized they were going to be in Jordan longer than they first thought,"" U.N. refugee agency official Nasser Touaibia said. ""(They) could not sit around and do nothing."" For proof of what they've done, look no farther than the Champs-Elysees. No, not the iconic boulevard in Paris, though the common name is a nod to that street and a reflection of Syrians' sense of humor. That's also the name of the Zaatari camp's now vibrant main drag. It's lined by mobile phone shops, mini markets, welding shops, barbers, fruit and vegetable stalls -- just about anything you can think of. This Champs-Elysees is a place where Syrians can make a little money, get what they need and, perhaps, restore some of their hope for the future. While non-governmental organizations and the United Nations are active in Zataari, and their employees even do some shopping there themselves, the more than 2,000 stores and such are made and run by refugees. Business is so brisk that a new road, Saudi Street, has popped up to accommodate new ventures. Touaibia estimates the Syrian refugees there generate approximately $10 million dollars a month in revenues. This doesn't necessarily make up for the larger strain that refugees have had on Jordan's economy, with an April 2014 International Monetary Fund report calling the overall impact ""negative."" Still, that same report also said, ""Increased consumption brought about by a sizable influx of Syrian refugees has contributed positively to economic activity."" And any economic activity is a plus for the Syrian refugees, two-thirds of whom live below the national poverty line and one in six who live in abject poverty, according to the United Nations. That's why Syrians like Abu Mohamad and humanitarian officials like Touaibia are pleased with what's happening in Zataari. While its residents' lives have been far from happy or normal of late, the refugee camp -- more and more -- is becoming just that. As Touaibia said, ""It is like any downtown, in any city, in the world.""","More than 83,000 people live in the Zataari refugee camp in northern Jordan, U.N. says .

"Two friends of Boston Marathon bombings suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty in Friday to a superseding federal indictment charging them with conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstructing justice with intent to impede authorities. A third friend, Robel Phillipos, pleaded not guilty to making false statements to FBI agents during the bombings investigation. Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov previously voiced their not guilty pleas on each of the counts during their arraignment on Aug. 13, but had to reenter their pleas in Boston to the new indictment, which added Phillipos. Phillipos remains free on $100,000 bond and is being monitored electronically. Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov are Kazakh nationals and are being held without bail. The two roommates began attending the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth the same semester as Tsarnaev. They were taken into custody this spring along with Phillipos, a friend of Tsarnaev's from Cambridge. ""My client is just as shocked and horrified as the rest of us about what happened,"" said Kadyrbayev's lawyer, Robert Stahl. ""He just hopes the American justice prevails and he can return home to his family."" Arkady Bukh, Tazhayakov's attorney, said, ""My client was very cooperative with the government."" Phillipos' attorneys, Derege Demissie and Susan Church, said in a statement that the indictment showed that his client ""had nothing to do whatsoever with the Boston Marathon Bombing or destroying any evidence afterwards."" ""In the end, it will be clear that this prosecution should never have been brought in the first place."" Authorities accuse the trio of helping Tsarnaev after the deadly April 15 bombing by taking items from his dorm room and keeping them from authorities. This occurred shortly before Tsarnaev was taken into custody after a tense, late-night standoff in Watertown. He and his brother -- who died after a confrontation with police -- are accused of planting two bombs near the Boston Marathon finish line that left three people dead and more than 260 wounded, then killing a campus police officer days later. Authorities allege on April 18, three days before the FBI searched Tsarnaev's dorm room, Kadyrbayev showed Tazhayakov a text message from Tsarnaev that read, in part, ""If yu want yu can go to my room and take what's there"" followed by a smiley face emoticon. That day, the trio allegedly went into the dorm, took Tsarnaev's laptop, as well as a backpack containing Vaseline, a thumb drive, fireworks and a ""homework assignment sheet"" and took and took them back to Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov's New Bedford apartment, the federal indictment against them states. ""The fireworks container has been opened and manipulated,"" the indictment says. ""As a result, some of the explosive powder was visible."" Kadyrbayev told his friends that he believed Tsarnaev ""used the Vaseline 'to make bombs,' or words to that effect,"" says the indictment. Either that night or early the next day, with Tazhayakov's knowledge, Kadyrbayev tossed the backpack in a dumpster, according to the charges. Phillipos is charged with lying to federal agents investigating the bombing, concealing the fact that he, Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov had gone into Tsarnaev's room and removed the backpack, the indictment says. If convicted, Phillipos faces a maximum penalty of up to 16 years in federal prison. Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov face a maximum penalty of 25 years and also face the possibility of being deported to Kazakhstan. Their next court date is Oct. 29. Tsarnaev awaits trial, having pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges tied to the bombing and the subsequent pursuit of he and his brother, Tamerlan.","Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov enter not guilty pleas in federal court .

"The North Korean hack of Sony Pictures that unleashed proprietary information, leaked embarrassing emails and brought the multi-billion dollar company's operations to its knees was unprecedented. But cyber security and intelligence experts warn that this is only the beginning. A CNN review of cyber attacks against federal agencies shows that the number of breaches into government systems is skyrocketing. ""Espionage is happening at a rate we have never seen before,"" said Denise Zheng, a deputy director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The numbers seem to bear that out. There were almost 61,000 cyber attacks and security breaches across the entire federal government last year according to a recent Obama administration report. And the number of cyber incidents involving government agencies has jumped 35 percent between 2010 and 2013, from roughly 34,000 to about 46,000, according to another recent report by the Government Accountability Office. ""This is a global problem. We don't have a malware problem. We have an adversary problem. There are people being paid to try to get inside our systems 24/7,"" said Tony Cole, vice president of the cyber security firm FireEye. Unclassified networks at the White House and State Department were recently hacked, leading the State Department to shut down its email system for days last month. RELATED: Official says U.S. will respond to North Korea . But it's not just spies looking to crack government computers. Hackers are also after personal information accessible through government computer systems, not unlike their counterparts who have nabbed millions of credit and debit card numbers from Target and Home Depot. Last July, hackers hit the Energy Department and took personally identifiable information from more than 100,000 people ""that could be used to damage the financial and personal interests of many individuals,"" according to a post-mortem report by the department's inspector general. The data included names; dates and places of birth; social security and bank account numbers; and information about their education and disabilities, according to the report. The hack cost the government almost $4 million in credit monitoring fees and lost productivity. Greg Wilshusen was one of the 100,000 people whose data was compromised by the attack, and the director of information security issues at the Government Accounting Office. He said the federal government's information technology is ""not as secure as it should be. GAO has been identifying this area as high risk since 1997. It's been a longstanding challenge for the federal government to adequately protect its systems."" Sometimes the threat comes from simple incompetence. Last year, the IRS mistakenly posted tens of thousands of social security numbers on government websites, according to the nonprofit Public.Resource.org. Perhaps not surprisingly, the Treasury Department's Inspector General for Tax Administration says protecting taxpayer and employee data is the IRS' most pressing challenge. RELATED: Hackers attacked the U.S. energy grid 79 times this year . Cole, the cyber security expert, points out that the IRS uses automated systems to process returns. If breached, billions of dollars in returns could be taken and the systems erased, forcing the IRS to use archives to try to reconstruct its system. ""One attack could cripple the (IRS) system,"" he said. Another troubling incident happened last January when hackers hit the Army Corps of Engineers and took sensitive information about the nation's 85,000 dams. That data included their location, condition and potential for fatalities if the dams were to be breached, according to a report by Sen. Tom Coburn, the ranking Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee. The uptick in security breaches is not because of a lack of spending, experts say. In fact, the Obama administration report showed that federal government agencies spent $10 billion on information security. The biggest culprits, experts say, are human error and a patchwork of different systems. Billions of dollars in security can't stop an employee from clicking a malicious link. ""There is no patch for a stupid user,"" said Zheng, who once oversaw a government cyber warfare program. Indeed, this year's Obama administration report found that so-called phishing attacks -- where users are duped into clicking links that open systems to hackers -- are the most widely reported cyber incident. In an ominous bit of foreshadowing of the Sony hack, National Intelligence Director James Clapper told Congress earlier this year that ""the likelihood of a destructive attack that deletes information or renders systems inoperable will increase."" Now, some experts say, an answer to the Sony hack is crucial. ""We need to have a response whether it's an industry or a government response so that folks understand there is a penalty here,"" Zheng said. ""If they go unpunished, the message that sends is detrimental.""

"A friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded guilty Thursday to charges in connection with removing a backpack and computer from Tsarnaev's dorm room after the bombing. Dias Kadyrbayev pleaded guilty to ""obstructing justice with the intent to impede the Boston Marathon bombing investigation,"" according to a press release from the office of the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts. He also pleaded guilty to conspiracy with his actions in the days immediately following the bombing. As part of the plea agreement, a sentence of seven years will be recommended by the U.S. attorney, and Kadyrbayev, a Kazakh national, has agreed to be deported after serving his sentence, according to the release. Kadyrbayev's attorney was not immediately available for comment Thursday. The charges stem from actions after bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013. Three people were killed and more than 200 were injured. Kadyrbayev was charged with four counts including obstructing justice and conspiracy for allegedly throwing Tsarnaev's backpack into a dumpster after discovering it contained fireworks with gunpowder, and removing a jar of Vaseline and a computer thumb drive. The backpack was later recovered at a landfill by investigators. Kadrybayev also allegedly took Tsarnaev's computer to his off-campus apartment, where the FBI later seized it. In July, Kadyrbayev's roommate Azamat Tazhayakov was convicted of conspiracy and obstruction charges in the same case and has filed an appeal. He faces up to 25 years in prison at his sentencing in October. In that case, prosecutors told jurors Tazhayakov knew the identity of the suspected bombers -- Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- before the public found out, allegedly texting Kadyrbayev: ""I think they got his brother,"" hours before the public knew their names or their relationship to one another. The friends recognized the Tsarnaev brothers after authorities released video and still photos asking for the public's helping finding the two men in the aftermath of the bombings, prosecutors said. Kadyrbayev told his friends that he believed Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ""used the Vaseline 'to make bombs,' or words to that effect,"" an indictment against him reads. The government said Tsarnaev texted Kadyrbayev after the bombings and told him he could go to his dorm room and take what he wanted. Kadyrbayev showed that text to Tazhayakov, the government alleged. Sentencing for Kadyrbayev is scheduled for November 18. If the court accepts the plea agreement, Kadyrbayev will be ""sentenced to no more than seven years in jail and three years of supervised release,"" then deported, according to the release.","The guilty plea was to obstructing justice and conspiracy .

"We take a lot for granted about the way the world looks today -- the widespread freedom, the unprecedented global prosperity (even despite the current economic crisis), and the absence of war among great powers. In 1941 there were only a dozen democracies in the world. Today there are more than 100. For four centuries prior to 1950, global GDP rose by less than 1 percent a year. Since 1950 it has risen by an average of 4 percent a year, and billions of people have been lifted out of poverty. The first half of the 20th century saw the two most destructive wars in the history of mankind, and in prior centuries war among great powers was almost constant. But for the past 60 years no great powers have gone to war. This is the world America made when it assumed global leadership after World War II. Would this world order survive if America declined as a great power? Some American intellectuals insist that a ""Post-American"" world need not look very different from the American world and that all we need to do is ""manage"" American decline. But that is wishful thinking. If the balance of power shifts in the direction of other powers, the world order will inevitably change to suit their interests and preferences. Take the issue of democracy. For several decades, the balance of power in the world has favored democratic governments. In a genuinely post-American world, the balance would shift toward the great power autocracies. Both China and Russia already protect dictators like Syria's Bashar al-Assad. If they gain greater relative influence in the future, we will see fewer democratic transitions and more autocrats hanging on to power. What about the free market, free trade economic order? People assume China and other rising powers that have benefited so much from the present system would have a stake in preserving it. They wouldn't kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. But China's form of capitalism is heavily dominated by the state, with the ultimate goal being preservation of the ruling party. Although the Chinese have been beneficiaries of an open international economic order, they could end up undermining it simply because, as an autocratic society, their priority is to preserve the state's control of wealth and the power it brings. They might kill the goose because they can't figure out how to keep both it and themselves alive. Finally, what about the long peace that has held among the great powers for the better part of six decades? Many people imagine that American predominance will be replaced by some kind of multipolar harmony. But multipolar systems have historically been neither stable nor peaceful. War among the great powers was a common, if not constant, occurrence in the long periods of multipolarity in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. The 19th century was notable for two stretches of great-power peace of roughly four decades each, punctuated, however, by major wars among great powers and culminating in World War I, the most destructive and deadly war mankind had known up to that point. The era of American predominance has shown that there is no better recipe for great-power peace than certainty about who holds the upper hand. Many people view the present international order as the inevitable result of human progress, a combination of advancing science and technology, an increasingly global economy, strengthening international institutions, evolving ""norms"" of international behavior, and the gradual but inevitable triumph of liberal democracy over other forms of government -- forces of change that transcend the actions of men and nations. But there was nothing inevitable about the world that was created after World War II. International order is not an evolution; it is an imposition. It is the domination of one vision over others -- in America's case, the domination of liberal free market principles of economics, democratic principles of politics, and a peaceful international system that supports these, over other visions that other nations and peoples may have. The present order will last only as long as those who favor it and benefit from it retain the will and capacity to defend it. If and when American power declines, the institutions and norms American power has supported will decline, too. Or they may collapse altogether as we transition into another kind of world order, or into disorder. We may discover then that the United States was essential to keeping the present world order together and that the alternative to American power was not peace and harmony but chaos and catastrophe -- which was what the world looked like right before the American order came into being.","Robert Kagan: We take for granted the relative peace, freedom and prosperity of the world .

"Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- A fight between a technology titan and the world's fastest-growing economy. Trade war tensions rising between Beijing and Washington, as U.S. legislators howl about unfair Chinese business practices and the Chinese media assail American arrogance. No, it's not the current battle between Google and China -- but the fight between Microsoft and Beijing in March 1994. ""The situation then could not have been worse ... it was dire,"" recalled Jia-Bin Duh, who in March 1994 -- on his second day on the job as president of Microsoft China -- met his new boss, Bill Gates, off a plane in Beijing for a series of icy meetings with the Chinese leadership. An examination of that fight sheds some light on why Microsoft is staying in China even as it takes increasing heat from the U.S. Congress for not following Google's lead out of China. Google announced last week it would quit censoring its China page and instead redirect users to its uncensored Hong Kong search engine. As a result, several Chinese companies have quit offering Google Search. The move received bipartisan praise from U.S. congressmen -- and some scorn toward Microsoft for not following suit with its search engine, Bing. Congress slams China and Microsoft, praises Google . ""They [Microsoft] need to get on the right side of human rights rather than enabling tyranny, which they're doing right now,"" said Rep. Chris Smith, a Republican from New Jersey, in a congressional hearing on Wednesday. Microsoft issued a statement, saying it would work with the Chinese government to foster a more open Internet -- but it would not leave. Perhaps because of its own thorny fight with China more than a decade ago. Sixteen years to the day before Google's March 22 announcement on leaving China, Microsoft Chairman Gates was in Beijing preparing to meet then-China President Jiang Zemin. That trip came as rancor between the U.S. and China -- and Microsoft -- was high over piracy, intellectual property rights and Beijing's fight for the renewal of its most-favored trade status with Washington, which was then under threat by the Clinton administration . For Microsoft, the trip was part of a full-court press to allow Microsoft to license a Chinese version of DOS and Windows for sale in the country. Beijing resisted, favoring local companies to provide software for the nation's nascent computer industry. In news stories from the trip, Gates is widely quoted upbraiding China for not letting market forces decide which software should be on China's computers. But behind closed doors in Beijing, it was Gates who was being lectured. ""It was not so pleasant,"" recalled Duh, a Taiwan-born technology executive who was recruited away from HP China to be on hand when Gates met Chinese government officials. Microsoft was told it didn't appreciate the strides China was making to try to curb piracy and develop its intellectual property rights law. They were told ""China is a country with a long history -- everything has to go through several stages of development,"" said Duh, who left Microsoft in 1998 to head Cisco Systems China. He is now a Taipei-based venture capitalist. ""If you want to have a successful business here, you have to be patient,"" they were told. In China, Bing's turn to show some spine . Microsoft began a long march of rapprochement with China. Eighteen months after his chilly reception in Beijing, Gates returned as part of a planned charm offensive for a causal 17-day tour of the country. This time, he brought a friend along for the ride -- Warren Buffett. With Jia as a tour guide, the trio met with President Jiang to get advice on where to visit and met Chinese industry leaders throughout the trip. Duh hesitates to call the trip a turning point in relations with Beijing, but it showed Microsoft's top executive was willing to put in the footwork on what is considered key for foreign businesses to succeed in China -- building personal relationships. That is why foreign Internet companies such as Google have largely failed to penetrate the Chinese market, said Edward Yu, an analyst for Analysis International in Beijing. China's Internet titans leave West behind . ""How (foreign companies) structure their partnerships and how they build relationships is crucially important,"" he said. ""Companies like Google or Yahoo are still comparatively young compared to an HP or a Microsoft, who have been in the China market for many more years and are more mature in their approach. ""They may grow fast in their home market, but foreign Internet firms are too young to understand the China market,"" Yu added. Indeed, Gates seems to have taken the ""long view"" advice from Jiang to heart, as he reversed his stance on the issue central to its thorny start with China: Piracy. ""It's easier for our software to compete with Linux when there's piracy than when there's not,"" Gates told Fortune magazine in 2007. The shift in thinking seemed to be: Better to have the long-tail profits down the road with users dependent on Microsoft software, even if it's pirated. That has paid off for Microsoft. A Reuters report said Microsoft's Chinese version of Windows sold fewer than 3,000 copies in February 1994, the month before Gates made his first journey to China. In 2007, Forbes estimates Microsoft revenue from China topped $700 million. Gates told the magazine he anticipated China -- which is now the world's second largest computer market -- would be Microsoft's top market by 2017. Moreover, the company's China operations have become an integral part of the company as a whole. The company's total operations in China are the largest in any country outside the United States. Microsoft opened its first research center in the country in 1998, and now has campuses in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. In 2008 the company announced plans to invest an additional $1 billion in Chinese research and more than double staff to 3000 in the next few years.

"A tanning salon manager has filed a federal lawsuit against Chicago police, saying officers brutalized her and committed a hate crime during a raid at the business, then tried to cover up their alleged wrongdoings. The lawsuit says the incident was captured on store security video that shows one officer striking a handcuffed and kneeling Jianqing ""Jessica"" Klyzek and another officer shouting racial slurs and threatening to have her killed. Klyzek, who is of Chinese descent and an American citizen, said in the lawsuit that she asked the officers to justify their actions. She said one officer replied, ""You're not (expletive) American! I'll put you in a UPS box and send you back to wherever the (expletive) you came from!"" The lawsuit said that when Klyzek insisted she was indeed a citizen, the officer said, ""No, you're not! You're here on our borrowed time. . ... And I'll take this place and then whoever owns it will (expletive) kill you because they don't care about you, OK? I'll take this building. You'll be dead and your family will be dead."" The incident is being investigated by Chicago's Independent Police Review Authority, Chicago police public information officer Adam Collins said. ""The alleged conduct and comments are reprehensible and completely intolerable in our police department,"" he said. ""We have codes of conduct that apply to officers, and if the allegations are proven accurate, appropriate action will be taken."" The raid occurred July 31, 2013, at the Copper Tan and Spa. Police have said they conducted the raid because an employee offered a sex act to an undercover officer, reported CNN affiliate WGN. Klyzek said police falsified information in investigation reports and charged her with a crime, though the exact charge is not described in the lawsuit. A judge found no probable cause, and the charge was dismissed, the lawsuit said. Later, police went to a prosecutor, and a case was presented to a grand jury, with Klyzek being indicted for aggravated battery of a police officer, the lawsuit said. The charge was dismissed when prosecutors saw the video, the lawsuit said. Klyzek said she suffered abrasions on her head, neck, arms and legs.

"The Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations on Wednesday called for an investigation into the shooting death of Ibragim Todashev, after reports surfaced saying that he was unarmed. Todashev, who knew Boston Marathon bombings suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was shot dead by an FBI agent last week. ""Our call for an independent investigation of this disturbing incident is not just about the victim and his family, but is also about constitutional rights and the rule of law,"" said CAIR-Tampa Executive Director Hassan Shibly. His comment came as unnamed sources told CNN affiliate WESH and the Washington Post that Todashev, a Muslim, was unarmed when he was shot at his home in Orlando while he was being questioned about his relationship with Tsarnaev. Official: Tamerlan involved in 2011 slayings . The FBI began investigating the incident immediately after the shooting -- standard procedure in any agent-involved shooting. ""While this internal review process is occurring, we cannot comment regarding investigative details,"" FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said Wednesday evening. ""The FBI takes very seriously any shooting incidents involving our agents and as such we have an effective, time-tested process for addressing them internally. The review process is thorough and objective and conducted as expeditiously as possible under the circumstances."" Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a law enforcement official told CNN Wednesday that Todashev had a ""violent confrontation"" with the agent. The official declined to discuss the details of that confrontation and would not say whether Todashev had a weapon. Former Chechen rebel: 'I have nothing to do with' Boston bombings . Previously, a federal law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the case told CNN that Todashev ""used some kind of weapon,"" and attacked the FBI agent. At that time, a source who had been briefed on the ongoing investigation, said Todashev had grabbed a knife, which is why fatal force was used, according the source. CAIR's Shibly said the only thing in the home that could have been construed as a weapon was a model sword on the wall, which was present for some five hours without incident. ""It was not sharp. It was a decorative piece, and it had a broken handle,"" he told reporters.","CAIR calls for an investigation into the shooting death of Ibragim Todashev .

"President Barack Obama is sending up to 1,500 more soldiers to Iraq to train Iraqi and Kurdish forces to fight ISIS, in a deployment that would almost double the total number of American troops there to 2,900. The White House said in a statement that it will also ask Congress for another $5.6 billion to fund the fight against ISIS. The troops will not have a combat role, and will operate from bases outside Baghdad and Erbil. To date, Anbar province and Taji district have been considered as two likely locations for operations centers outside of Baghdad and Erbil. CNN reported last week that the military was preparing plans to deploy U.S. advisers to Anbar, much of which is under the control of ISIS. ""The President took these decisions at the request of the Iraqi Government and upon the recommendation of Secretary Hagel and his military commanders based upon the assessed needs of the Iraqi Security Forces,"" the statement said. ""We believe this request is an opportunity for Congress and this Administration to work together to provide the additional resources needed to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL and I look forward to working with Congress to secure this funding,"" said Shaun Donovan, Obama's budget director. The budget request marks an early test for cooperation between Obama and congressional leaders following the Republican rout in this week's midterm elections that reshaped Washington's balance of power. It includes $1.6 billion to establish a fund to develop and support Iraqi and Kurdish security forces as they gear up to mount a counter offensive against ISIS, which has carved out a so-called caliphate in vast swathes of Iraq and Syria. The requests are based on an assessment of Iraqi security forces made by US Central Command, said Pentagon spokesman, Rear Admiral John Kirby. CENTCOM will set up training centers for nine Iraqi army and three Kurdish Peshmerga brigades, Kirby said. He said that Obama took the decision to go ahead and almost double the number of trainers and advisers following a request from the Iraqi government of Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi. He said that the mission was possible because Iraqi forces, which were built with billions of dollars in US funding, and partially folded in the face of the ISIS advance, had ""stiffened"" their spines. ""We are going in at the request of the Iraqi government. We are wanted there,"" said Kirby . ""There is a very acute threat that is facing the Iraqi people and the Iraqi government."" The White House has insisted that the US operation against ISIS will not include ""boots on the ground."" But the new announcement by an administration that made ending foreign wars a core of its foreign policy is likely to fuel new concerns of ""mission creep"" among the president's critics. But Steny Hoyer, Democratic House minority whip, told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" that he would back the funding. ""I don't think this is mission creep,"" he said. A Republican congressional source complained that the administration had not formally briefed senior lawmakers on Capitol Hill over the new funding and troop request. Howard 'Buck' McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services committee, said that he would consider the request, but warned that the president's strategy to combat ISIS was insufficient. ""I would urge the President to reconsider his strategy and clearly explain how this additional funding supports a new direction. Such clarity is more likely to find swift congressional approval,"" he said in a statement. The top U.S. military commander in the fight against ISIS insisted on Thursday that airstrikes are working to erode the radical Islamic group's capabilities. PHOTOS: The ISIS terror threat . ""I'm confident we're having the desired effects,"" said Army Gen. Lloyd Austin. He said that ISIS fighters were afraid to congregate in any sizable formation in Syria and Iraq amid fears they could be target by US and allied aircraft. A senior US defense official meanwhile told CNN this week that the administration had not ruled out expanding the war in Syria to another radical group, the  Al-Qaeda affilitated al-Nusra. Such a move would be intended to repel its advances against moderate Syria rebels on which Washington has anchored its strategy of battling ISIS.","Obama will send up to 1,500 troops to Iraq .

"(CNN)French officials are still trying to determine what caused gunmen to attack a satirical magazine in Paris, killing 12 people. But, according to French media, the gunmen yelled, ""We have avenged the Prophet!"" as they stormed the office. Charlie Hebdo, the French satirical magazine attacked on Wednesday, has a controversial history of depicting Mohammed, often in an unfavorable light, which has angered many Muslims around the world. The prohibition again illustrating the Prophet Mohammed began as a attempt to ward off idol worship, which was widespread in Islam's Arabian birthplace. But in recent years, that prohibition has taken on a deadly edge. A  central tenet of Islam is that Mohammed was a man, not God, and that portraying him could lead to revering him in lieu of Allah. ""It's all rooted in the notion of idol worship,"" Akbar Ahmed, who chairs the Islamic Studies department at American University told CNN. ""In Islam, the notion of God versus any depiction of God or any sacred figure is very strong."" In some ways, Islam was a reaction against Christianity, which early Muslims believed had been led astray by conceiving of Christ, not as a man but as a God. They didn't want the same thing to happen to Mohammed. ""The prophet himself was aware that if people saw his face portrayed by people, they would soon start worshiping him,"" Ahmed told CNN. ""So he himself spoke against such images, saying 'I'm just a man.' "" In a bitter irony, the sometimes violent attacks against portrayals of the prophet are kind of reverse idol-worship, revering -- and killing for -- the absence of an image, said Hussein Rashid, a professor of Islamic studies at Hofstra University in New York. In November 2011, Charlie Hebdo's office was burned down on the same day the magazine was due to release an issue with a cover that appeared to poke fun at Islamic law. The cover cartoon depicted a bearded and turbaned cartoon figure of the Prophet Mohammed, with a bubble saying, ""100 lashes if you're not dying of laughter."" In September 2012, as France was closing embassies in about 20 countries amid the global furor over the anti-Islam film ""Innocence of Muslims,"" the magazine published an issue featuring a cartoon that appeared to depict a naked Mohammed, along with a cover that seemed to show Mohammed being pushed in a wheelchair by an Orthodox Jew. Charlie Hebdo journalist Laurent Leger defended the magazine at the time, saying the cartoons were not intended to provoke anger or violence. ""The aim is to laugh,"" Leger told BFMTV in 2012. ""We want to laugh at the extremists -- every extremist. They can be Muslim, Jewish, Catholic. Everyone can be religious, but extremist thoughts and acts we cannot accept."" But for many Muslims, depictions of Mohammed, revered not only as a prophet but also as a moral exemplar, are no laughing matter. Satirical representations of Muhammad are not new, although they are very modern, said Rashid. ""In the context of Europe, where in many countries Muslims feel like they are besieged, these images are not seen as criticism, but as bullying. Violence, as a response, is clearly wrong and disproportionate. However, it is not so much about religious anger, as it is about vengeance."" But even in the United States, where Muslims are relatively acclimated, extremists have opposed the portrayal of Mohammed on ""South Park,"" the satirical cartoon show, and the subsequent ""Draw Mohammed Day,"" that erupted in response. Mohamed Magid, an imam and former head of Islamic Society of North America, told CNN that the Muslim prohibition on depicting prophets extends to Jesus and Moses, whom Islam treats as prophets. Some Muslim countries banned the films ""Noah"" and ""Exodus"" this year because their leading characters were Hebrew prophets. In Sunni mosques, the largest branch of the faith, there are no human images of any kind. The spaces are instead decorated with verses from the Quran. But there have been historical instances of Muslims depicting the prophet, especially in Shiite branches of Islam,  Omid Safi, a religious studies professor at Duke University, told CNN. ""We have had visual depictions of the prophet in the form of miniatures and pictures in the Iranian context, the Turkish context, the central Asian context,"" said Safi. ""The one significant context where depictions of the prophet have not been image-related has been in the Arab context."" Johari Abdul-Malik, the imam for Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church, Virginia, told CNN that depictions of the prophet 's teachings were sometimes used to bridge gaps in illiteracy. Even historical renditions of Mohammed by Muslim artists were careful not to paint the prophet in too much detail. For example, Ahmed told CNN that Muslim artists in the 15th and 16th centuries would depict the prophet but took pains to avoid drawing his face. ""It would be as if he was wearing a veil on his face, so the really orthodox could not object -- that was the solution they found."" In a  Muslim film called ""The Messenger,"" which circulated throughout the Muslim world in the 1970s and 1980s, Mohammed was shown only in shadow. In  the Quran, there is ""no statement from the prophet requesting his image not be recorded,"" Abdul-Malik told CNN. Instead, the teaching about images comes from the hadith, a record of the sayings and actions of the Prophet Mohammed and his closest companions. The hadith is considered secondary only to the Quran in terms of textual authority, but the sometimes contradictory accounts have led to centuries of debates within the umma, or global Muslim community. Scholars of religion say opposition to portraying Mohammed wasn't generally violated in earlier centuries because of a gulf between Western and majority-Muslim nations. In the age of globalization, non-Muslims and critics of Islam have felt free to depict Mohammed, including in offensive ways. In 2006, for example, a Danish cartoonist's depiction of the prophet wearing a bomb as a turban with a lit fuse sparked demonstrations across the world. CNN's Nick Thompson and Eric Marrapodi contributed to this report.","Objections to portrayal of Mohammed ""rooted in the notion of idol worship,"" professor says .

"(CNN)A Chinese newspaper has come under fire for taking photos of the body of Yao Beina, a popular singer, at a hospital morgue after her death from breast cancer. The Shenzhen Evening News issued an apology on Sunday on their official Sina Weibo account, a widely used Chinese social media site, confirming the incident. ""We sincerely apologize for the disturbance and discomfort we have caused to Yao's family, fans and netizens,"" the statement read. The newspaper admitted to taking photos of the 33-year-old's body during a cornea removal surgery in a operating room after her death on Friday evening at a Shenzhen Hospital. She had agreed to donate her corneas after her death. According to the statement, the photos were deleted immediately after family members objected. Yao is a pop star known for singing the Chinese version of ""Let It Go"" from Disney's blockbuster""Frozen."" She first rose to fame in China's hit reality television singing competition, ""The Voice"", in 2013. Allegations of the incident surfaced on social media a day after the news of the 33-year-old's death broke. A widely shared post on Weibo under the user name ""Entertainment Whistleblower"" said that three journalists from the Shenzhen Evening News pretended to be medical staff assisting in the surgery, and sneaked into the morgue to take photographs of the deceased singer's body. The statement from the newspaper did not say how many journalists were involved or detail exactly how the photos were obtained. CNN contacted the hospital about the allegations, but they had no comment on the incident. The allegations unleashed a storm of criticism about media ethics on social media. ""Where is your humanity?"" commented one Weibo user, referring to the newspaper. ""A simple apology online and that's all you're going to do about an incident that seriously oversteps ethical borders?"" said another.

"Juan De la Torre is living in the United States completely legally. He came here from Mexico with his parents at age 14. His father, a migrant worker, became a permanent resident and filed immigrant petitions for the whole family. Eighteen years later, De la Torre is still in a constant cycle of waiting to hear from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. He's not an American citizen. He doesn't even have a green card, or permanent residency status. He's just in limbo, waiting to upgrade to a green card from his approved immigrant petition. In the immigration debate that has gripped the country, De la Torre is one of many legal immigrants who feel they've been overlooked. What to do about millions of undocumented immigrants has been discussed at length in government and the media. But legal immigrants, who say they're spending countless hours and thousands of dollars to do it right, want reform to help their struggle, too. De la Torre's experience isn't unheard of. For most legal immigrants, it takes at least five years to become a citizen, and that's after you already have a green card -- a process that can take years because of the finite number of visas available. Some legal immigrants live in the United States for 10 years or more before finally becoming naturalized citizens. And they want you to know that, by the way, they've had to pay taxes that whole time. President Obama is listening to the country's frustrations with the immigration process. He has already made immigration reform a second-term priority, and in his address on immigration this week, the president discussed both illegal and legal immigration. When talking about the legal immigration system, Obama focused on the need to keep promising students and entrepreneurs in the country to help grow the American economy. He also stressed the importance of keeping families together. ""If you're a citizen, you shouldn't have to wait years before your family is able to join you in America,"" Obama said. While Julie Richard thought the president's remarks were ""definitely a step in the right direction,"" she wished he had been more specific. She and her 7-month-old daughter belong to one of the families that have been torn apart. They can't live with her husband and almost never get to see him. Richard is Canadian, husband Brandon Gray is American and daughter Freja was born in the States. When Freja was 2 weeks old, Richard and Gray took her to Canada to visit Richard's family. But when they tried to get back to their home in Pennsylvania, Richard was denied entrance to the United States. She no longer qualified for a visitor visa because she intended to stay. Even though she had applied for a green card some time back, she says officials won't let her into the United States until she has it ""in hand,"" a process that could take up to a year. Gray joining the family in Canada is not an option -- he serves in the National Guard and is a full-time college student -- so they've been living apart for six months. Richard recently found out she's been granted an interview, the final step toward getting a green card, but she doesn't yet know when it will be. ""I have stopped keeping track of all of the firsts (Gray) is missing out on,"" she says. ""I don't want to think about it and to tell him would only serve to break his heart even further."" ""I regret to this day not calling a lawyer before leaving the (United States),"" she added. ""I'm not looking to jump the queue; I just want to wait down in the States."" Even for families that are able to stay together, the hardships that come with waiting for citizenship aren't trivial. It took De la Torre, the man who's been waiting 18 years for a green card, eight years to get a bachelor's degree. As a noncitizen, he wasn't eligible for much financial aid and had to work part-time. Other noncitizens aren't allowed to work at all. Carlos Paris is able to work, but says that comes with a set of problems all its own. A mechanical engineer originally from Venezuela, he has been in the United States for eight years with his wife and two children on an H-1B visa, which is for foreign workers with specialized expertise. That means if he were to lose his job, he could be forced to leave the country. He worries about having to restart the entire immigration process from scratch -- a daunting prospect, given the expense and waiting time involved. ""I think (politicians) are going about this all wrong,"" Paris says. ""You should cater to the well-prepared people, and cater to them well. Restrict illegal immigration, but maintain a more reasonable legal immigration policy."" De la Torre, who says the immigration offices know him by name at this point, would like to see immigration policy that addresses both undocumented and documented immigrants. ""I'm very happy they're helping the 11 million people here illegally, but what are they doing for us?"" he says. ""What good is it for me to be legal if they're not going to help us? I've been paying taxes since I got my Social Security card when I was 21. But yet I'm not receiving anything back.""","Some legal immigrants feel they're being overlooked in the immigration debate .

"(CNN)Let the hype begin! After four months of exciting gridiron action, America (and the world) has its Super Bowl combatants. The Seattle Seahawks will face off against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX on February 1 in Glendale, Arizona. Whether you're a hardcore NFL fan or just a wannabe watching the game for the halftime show and commercials, here are 5 things you need to know for the Super Bowl: . This will only be the 11th time that the No. 1 team from the NFC will play the No. 1 team from AFC. And this matchup of No. 1 seeds is happening for the second year in a row. Usually one of the top teams stubs its toe in the playoffs on the way to Super Bowl glory. Winning the big prize twice is just plain hard to do. Just ask Barack Obama. But if the Seahawks succeed in winning another championship in two weeks, they will be the first repeat NFL champs in a decade. No team has done that since ... the New England Patriots in 2005. Speaking of the Pats, the Bill Belichick-Tom Brady era in New England has been nothing short of phenomenal. The coach-QB combo has produced three Super Bowl wins, 12 division championships and a record of 180-55 together. But there's more history to be made. Belichick -- now the winningest coach in NFL postseason history with 21 wins -- will become only the second coach to appear in six Super Bowls, while Brady will become the only quarterback to play in six Super Bowls. After this year's title tilt, the NFL will break with tradition (for one year) and ditch using Roman numerals in the Super Bowl name. The 2016 version of the championship game -- the 50th, to be played in the San Francisco 49ers' Levi's Stadium -- will simply be known as Super Bowl 50. The Roman numerals are set to return in 2017 for Super Bowl LI. Some folks (OK, lots of folks), don't care about the game at all. They'll be watching to see who's performing at halftime. After many years of halftime shows featuring a musical mashup of singers and groups (up until the Justin Timberlake-Janet Jackson fiasco), the NFL seems to have found a winner with shows focused on a single artist. Think of the great Super Bowl halftime shows put on by Prince, Bruce Springsteen and Beyonce. And Bruno Mars simply set the stage on fire last year. This year get ready to ""roar"" with Katy Perry, and she's bringing in Lenny Kravitz for backup. Idina Menzel (best known to little girls everywhere as Queen Elsa) will sing the national anthem. Oh, and for those keeping up with such things (for entertainment purposes only, of course), the early Las Vegas line on the Super Bowl has Seattle as a slight favorite over New England. But that's subject to change during the next two weeks of unyielding buildup to the game.","Seattle Seahawks seek to become first repeat champs in a decade .

"Guns are an American pastime. A way to feed a family.  A way to protect a family. A way of life. Those are some of the words gun owners use to describe their relationship with firearms and the powerful emotions that stir up when they talk about them. In the days after a gunman killed a dozen theater-goers in Aurora, Colorado, talk turned to gun ownership, access and restrictions, as it often does after mass shootings. CNN iReport went to the firearms owners and asked for their perspective. We received more than 400 iReports from gun owners. The stories of gun ownership in America and the feelings behind it are diverse and not so easily explained. Here are five things they want the world to know: . ""Owning a firearm is not a right that I take lightly."" -- Jason Bostic, Fredericktown, Ohio . Jason Bostic, a firefighter and information technology director in Fredericktown, Ohio, grew up around firearms and now owns guns for protection, recreational shooting, competition, hunting and investment. When seconds count, he feels confident knowing he could defend himself against a violent criminal. He is aware that gun ownership comes with heavy responsibilities. That has meant attending hunter safety courses, shooting workshops, specific training for pistols, rifles, shotguns and self defense, among other instruction. Fear drives opposition to gun control . Bostic is the father of a toddler, who he already talks to about guns. When the time is right, he will teach his boy how to properly handle firearms so the child can pass on the family tradition. ""He doesn't touch them, he doesn't play with them, and there is no free-willy-nilly pointing toy gun at people,"" Bostic wrote. ""He asks questions when they are out or when I am cleaning and doing work on them and they are answered. Most importantly my guns are secured."" ""If you love your children, you will teach them how to handle a real firearm."" -- Ilidio Serra, Aurora, Illinois . Too many children are exposed to the fantasy weapons of video games and not real ones, says Ilidio Serra. He calls himself a ""Democratic liberal"" but also feels strongly that the more he can take the mystery and glamour out of firearms for his 11-year-old son, the safer his child will be. He thinks other parents should do the same. Debate: Gun owners go head-to-head in wake of Aurora tragedy . He knows how that sounds -- an 11-year-old who has his own guns and a mother who allows it. But maybe, he says, ""if more families worked towards how to safely handle firearms, we would have less firearm accidents."" ""Never being exposed to a real weapon by someone who loves them does not allow them to learn what an improperly handled weapon can do,"" Serra said. ""With all the video games, kids have become too desensitized to what a firearm really is and what it does. All they get to do is just shoot away ... score some points and never really think about what it really does."" ""Firearms are a way of life."" -- Alexis Frazier, Kamiah, Idaho . Alexis Frazier, 29, grew up fearing guns. But as she grew older and spent time with hunters and shooting sportsmen, she learned ""they are vital tools for survival and have a special culture attached to their use."" Living in Idaho, she now owns pistols, shotguns and rifles for hunting and sport shooting, and says guns ""can be a gateway to a wonderful sportsman lifestyle."" She believes gun owners have a responsibility ""to be kind and sensitive to folks who don't have exposure to firearms. There is so much fear surrounding this issue and I think mutual understanding and respect can replace this fear if people try."" Jason Lee Van Dyke, a lawyer, pistol instructor and competition shooter in Aubrey, Texas, echoed the sentiments of other gun owners when he wrote, ""shooting is about more than hunting and self defense. It is about having fun."" ""Fun is the reason many people purchase these so-called 'assault rifles,' because let's face it, the AR-15 is incredibly fun to shoot,"" he said. ""Nobody 'needs' a Ferrari either -- but a Ferrari is a heck of a lot more fun to drive than a Kia."" ""As a young woman who lives alone and lives in a rather rough area of town, guns are what allow me to sleep at night."" -- Layland Oberschulte, Napa Valley, California . Self-described country kid Layland Oberschulte, 24, has never had to use a gun for self-defense. But she keeps a loaded handgun in her nightstand and an unloaded revolver in her vehicle. ""Some people might say move, find a better city to live in, whatever. I'm happy where I am and I'm happy with my ability to protect myself,"" she said. ""Those skills come from a lifetime of safe gun training and ownership."" In Ashland, Ohio, Christina Roberto didn't know anything about firearms until she bought her first gun and learned to shoot a couple years ago. She felt that was her duty as a mother, ""in a world where fewer and fewer people take responsibility for their own thoughts, words and actions."" Putting her gun into its holster each morning has become as routine as slipping into a pair of pants or shoes, says Leslie Murray, a mother in Kennedale, Texas. She got her concealed handgun permit about a year ago. When she's with her daughter, she no longer worries that something bad will happen to either of them. ""I know there are still bad people out there,"" she said. ""I feel a peace of mind knowing that the bad people that commit crimes now have one more person secretly fighting against them."" William Cates works the night shift. It comforts him to know his wife sleeps next to a revolver. ""And it comforts her as well,"" said Cates, 22, of Calhoun, Georgia. ""She knows how to be safe with a gun, and how to use it."" ""It disturbs me when I hear people say things like, 'If someone in the crowd in Colorado had been armed, the whole thing could have been stopped.'"" -- Grayson Cash, Savannah, Georgia . It's a point we heard many times. If a gun owner could have carried his weapon into the theater that night, he might have wounded or killed the shooter -- or at least saved some lives. Commenters debated it at length on CNN. Commenters debate guns, 'what if' ""I would have shot back,"" Paul Lambert, 28, a veteran in Southern Indiana, wrote in his iReport. ""If nothing else, the attacker would have to focus on the civilians shooting at him instead of all the unarmed people running around."" Perhaps. But more likely, it's wishful thinking to believe ""you could have stopped the whole thing, if only you had been there with your .38."" said Grayson Cash, an airline pilot who owned his first gun at 13 years old. ""As someone who has some firearm and self-defense training, I find it laughable to think that the average Joe, in a dark theater filled with teargas, could take out a well armed and armored assailant with a five-round .38 special,"" he said. ""Arming more people will only eventually end in an accidental death."" Cash said he rarely fires weapons now, except for at the shooting range, and believes there should be strict rules for firearm purchases. ""I do not think the solution is to arm more people.

"A Shanghai metro official has unleashed a wave of angry social media messages in response to a post earlier this week that scantily-clad women invite sexual harassment. The Shanghai No. 2 Subway Co. posted the image of a woman in a semi-transparent dress on one of its platforms to the company's official Sina Weibo account with a caption warning women that if they dressed like that, they would surely be harassed. A Weibo user who called themselves ""Little Bunny"" posted: ""If you think a women dresses improperly, you can call the police but it doesn't mean you are free to touch her ... when harassment happens, why is the victim the first one blamed?"" Now, pictures have popped up on China's twitter-like social media site of two women, whose faces are covered by black cloth, protesting the criticism and support is pouring in. The pictures, published on China Daily, showed a woman holding up a sign that translated to ""I can be slutty, but you can't harass me,"" while riding on Shanghai Metro Line No. 2. The Shanghai metro company said its intention was never to condemn women, but to educate them. ""Our initial motive behind the post was to affirm our stand against sexual harassment and gender discrimination and to remind passengers to dress appropriately in public places in order to avoid unnecessary trouble,"" subway official Chen Kuang told Xinhua. The Chinese state news service also reported that sexual harassment claims on the Shanghai subway rose in the month of June. Reports included instances of indecent exposure, lewd acts and attempts at taking pictures up women's skirts. While online support for the women was strong, Weibo users were also siding with the metro's stance. One user who called himself ""A man like me"" said that that type of dress ""naturally attracts sexual offenders, just like flies like rubbish."" Despite the level of public outcry, the metro company has not yet deleted the original post.","A Shanghai metro employee says women need to dress more modestly to avoid sexual harassment in the metro .

"Every December, foreign correspondents in China go through the rigmarole of renewing press cards and visas, which typically run out at the end of the year. This time around, Chinese authorities held up renewing the credentials of roughly two dozen Bloomberg and New York Times reporters after the two American news outfits published muckraking stories about the wealth of the families of top Chinese leaders. Without renewed press cards, they could not renew their Chinese visas. Without the visas, reporters and their families would be forced to leave China. ""5 Days Till Visa Expiry,"" New York Times reporter Andrew Jacobs, tweeted on Tuesday. TIMELINE: Journalists under pressure . ""Do you think hauling all my stuff to gates of the Foreign Ministry holding a tag sale will get their attention?"" After a tense wait, all Bloomberg reporters and some of the New York Times reporters picked up their renewed press cards on Thursday. ""We are in contact with Chinese officials and remain hopeful that our resident journalists in the country will be issued visas that will allow them to continue to work there,"" New York Times spokesperson, Emily Murphy, told me by email. This is a welcome development, but to fellow reporters in China that's a small consolation. ""So we've come down to this,"" said Newsweek correspondent Melinda Liu. ""We rejoice over something that used to be routine."" Working as a foreign correspondent in China sounds glamorous and rewarding, and quite often it is. We cover landmark events, interview fascinating personalities and travel to exotic places. But, as the visa controversy shows, it also involves a lot of hard work and hassles -- China ranks 173 out of 179 countries for press freedom, according to Reporters Without Borders. Early frustrations . When I was just cutting my teeth as a foreign correspondent in the 1980s, the rules and regulations were so tight that it was difficult to get access to people and travel outside of Beijing. Many places were not accessible to foreigners. A lot of information was deemed ""neibu"", or for internal consumption only. A story done in one afternoon in most other beats would take weeks of waiting and gestation in China. The protracted process often lead to unsatisfying results -- and frustrations. Doing an enterprise story then was difficult and dangerous. I remember doing a story for TIME magazine in the late 1980s. We traveled to rural Renshou county, Sichuan Province to follow up on reports of farmers rioting over local corruption. Just minutes after we had started interviewing a group of farmers gathered in a home, three men in civilian clothes barged in and started to ask who we were and why we were there. We cut short our interview and hopped into our rented car. The local driver was as scared as I was. ""Those people can be ruthlessly violent,"" he told me. Technically, such reporting trips violated China's ""10-day rule"", which required foreign journalists to secure permission from local ""waiban"" (foreign affairs office) 10 days in advance before we could conduct reporting outside our home base in Beijing or Shanghai. Whenever we were caught doing so, Chinese authorities gave us verbal reprimands or asked us to write ""self-criticisms."" China is changing . To be sure, the working conditions for foreign reporters have significantly improved compared to 1982, when I started my career as a China correspondent. China has allowed more reporters into the country, allowing expanded coverage about varied, lighter aspects of Chinese life. In 1977, one year after Chairman Mao Zedong's death, there were only 39 foreign reporters in China. The number increased to about 100 when my China role began five years later. Now, our ranks have expanded to nearly 700 working for 441 news outlets from 59 countries, mostly based in Beijing and Shanghai. We used to be focused on human rights issues and politics. Now we report on a gamut of themes -- health, finance, Internet and fashion among them. Over the years the restrictions have loosened, especially right before the 2008 Olympics when China rescinded the 10-day rule. We still face problems, especially in the provinces where officials have vested interests and narrow ways of viewing things. To them, foreign journalists -- and our reporting -- can create trouble for them, especially when we expose wrongdoings and abuses. Local officials need to be told that the new normal is to allow us to conduct interviews and photo shoots freely. They need to understand how foreign journalists operate, why we do things a certain way, why we need information promptly and accurately. To be fair, there are many Chinese officials I know who subscribe to this new mindset and have been trying hard to shake things up or do things differently. Some of them are quite frustrated with the result of their efforts. ""Too much negativity,"" complains one. ""We have tried hard to give access to foreign journalists but their stories still end up negative. We don't expect them to report like Chinese journalists but we hope they will be just objective and even-handed."" I hope these officials will keep pushing forward, instead of backward. It will show a measure of self-confidence and will push China closer to the international norms and standards of media management. Important future role . Indeed although it's a lot easier now serving as a foreign correspondent there's still much to be desired. In a year-end statement, the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China noted ""a number of negative trends over the past year."" Their list includes: . -- denial of visa to Paul Mooney, a long-time reporter known for his reporting on human rights; . -- new rules that stipulate the police may take a maximum of 15 business days to process visas, which means that reporters cannot leave the country during this period; and . -- spontaneous designation of locations, such as Tiananmen Square, where special permission is said to be required to film or report. Meanwhile, censorship continues. Web sites containing material considered sensitive by the Chinese government are often blocked. Cable television channels such as CNN and the BBC are closely monitored and sensitive topics are routinely blacked out. We, as media, must also remain vigilant against self-censorship. I feel little personal risk as a reporter, but our biggest concern remains the protection of sources who are usually more vulnerable to the government's control. None of us wish to land them in jail. China is a crucial news beat for CNN and our audience. As the country evolves into a freer, more pluralistic society, the importance of covering China in all its many facets will only grow. There is a lot about the country, its people and culture our audience wants to know. However, we cannot talk about the world's most populous country -- and the world's second biggest economy -- while avoiding inconvenient issues and unpleasant subjects. As journalists, we are bearers of news, both good and bad. We just ask: don't shoot the messenger.","Two dozen China journalists in tense wait for reporting visas after controversial stories .

"Here's what you need to know about Sean Collier, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus cop who was shot to death by the suspected Boston Marathon bombers. When he went hiking with the MIT Outing Club, he brought extra ear plugs for others to block out snoring in the crowded mountain cabin. When his car got hit by a swerving vehicle, Collier immediately went to check if the other driver was injured. Even those who barely knew him filled a tribute page set up Friday with memories of his easy laugh and ever-present smile, his desire to help others and his motivation to be a good police officer. ""He had a really great smile. I'll always remember that,"" Kristina Lozoya, a student volunteer with the MIT emergency medical service, told CNN. ""He was always laughing. He loved his job."" Carin King, another volunteer with the service that runs the campus ambulance, told CNN that Collier ""went out of his way"" to get to know the student emergency medical technicians (EMTs). ""A few months ago he was on a call with me where the patient was very seriously ill,"" King related in an e-mail. ""He followed up with the family and then stopped by our bunkroom to look for me every day for a week so he could let me know that our patient was now OK."" On Thursday night, when news emerged that an MIT officer had been shot, King sent Collier an e-mail ""to make sure he was OK."" She never got an answer. ""I figured I was being overly cautious,"" King added. ""It's truly a heartbreaking situation."" Such a connection reflected the 27-year-old Massachusetts native's approach to police work. While his brother, Andrew, became a machinist in the engine department at Hendrick Motorsports, one of the major NASCAR racing teams, Sean followed a different path. ""Sean was one of these guys who really looked at police work as a calling,"" MIT Police Chief John DiFava said in a statement posted on the university website. ""He was born to be a police officer."" Collier died a police officer, shot to death in his squad car on the MIT campus. In a statement Friday, his family asked for privacy. ""We are heartbroken by the loss of our wonderful and caring son and brother,"" the statement said. ""Our only solace is that Sean died bravely doing what he committed his life to -- serving and protecting others."" President Barack Obama praised Collier on Friday night following the conclusion of a daylong manhunt for the second of two marathon bombing suspects, saying he was a dedicated officer. ""We are grateful to him,"" Obama said. Collier's killing and a subsequent carjacking nearby set off the search that paralyzed Boston. The suspects were identified as brothers. One died following a shootout with police while the second was taken into custody, officials said. After the blasts Monday near the finish line of the iconic road race, Collier's slaying further traumatized many in the MIT community who had gotten to know him during his 15 months on the job. ""The loss of Officer Collier is deeply painful to the entire MIT community,"" MIT President L. Rafael Reif said on the university website. That included the MIT Outing Club, which organizes hiking and skiing excursions in the region. Collier, who was single, was an avid participant in trips to the mountains of New England that he hiked as a boy. Club members described him as endlessly energetic and a joyous companion on the trail and around the campfire. ""We recall him bringing earplugs for an entire cabin full of people, going out of his way to give people rides, offering help for bike or any other problems,"" said a statement on a tribute page set up at MIT. ""He made a point of getting to know students, asking them about details of their lives, enthusiastically sharing his own experiences. He brightened the lives of all of us, and words cannot describe the loss we feel."" Fellow club member Andrew Ding told of the car crash during a drive to New Hampshire, describing how Collier showed no hint of anger or exasperation over the damage to his vehicle. ""Sean was the first out of our car to go check and see if the (other driver) was OK,"" Ding wrote in an email to CNN, adding that ""it would be exceedingly difficult to imagine him not stepping up and doing the right thing when he had the chance, which unfortunately he did last night."" Such awareness and devotion were evident in college, said Kristen Kuehnle, who chairs the department of criminal justice at Salem State University, where Collier graduated with honors in 2009 as a criminal justice major. Kuehnle remembered that Collier got an 'A' in the ""Women in Criminal Justice"" class she taught, recalling him as ""bright"" and well-rounded with a ""great sense of humor that you really need."" ""When you're graduating with honors, you've demonstrated ability to be thoughtful and look at all perspectives,"" she said. Describing Collier as a model candidate for police work, she said he had ""the vision that we are looking for in our students."" ""He always wanted to be a police officer,"" Kuehnle said. ""That was pretty clear, but it wasn't like the whistles and bells and toys. It was about really wanting to make a difference and being good at what you do."" That's the impression he left on those who knew him at MIT. ""Sean is not the stereotypical cop who is kind of intimidating, but rather a friendly and down-to-earth kind of guy that you would want to be friends with,"" David Hou, an MIT sophomore, told CNN. To Ding, Collier was ""the kind of guy you'd ask to watch your wallet."" Ben Artin, another EMS volunteer, told how Collier proposed arranging a social event to help broaden the relationship between the campus police and the emergency service workers. ""Sean was rare in the degree to which, while working for MIT PD, he wanted to socially engage with the students,"" Artin wrote to CNN, adding that ""I hope that we follow through on this proposal as we heal.""","Sean Collier was shot to death Thursday night  on the MIT campus .

"(CNN)""Don't be all Mariah"" a deep Irish brogue calls out from behind a large piano. Inside the Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in downtown Atlanta, the 17 members of the Atlanta Homeward Choir have vocal cords that are perhaps a bit too eager to express themselves. So Donal Noonan, the church's music director, has to tell them to temper their tone a bit. Smiling isn't something the men are accustomed to. The members of this choir are homeless. Many have struggled with drug and alcohol addiction. Noonan founded the group in November 2013 after being moved by what he saw on his morning commute through downtown streets: ""These folks were just sitting there waiting for something, and what that was it was almost like they were waiting for a bus, but the bus came and went and they were still on the wall."" The native of Kilcock, Ireland, thought about how to help, and came to the realization that music was his biggest gift to share. An idea was born. He went inside a night shelter next to his job, to find members for his choir. Seven men with limited musical experience stepped forward for the first season. They now have expanded to 17 members, and have performed around the Atlanta area, including at city hall. Noonan says the choir gives the men a gift to help get themselves off the streets: ""Confidence, self-worth, being part of a community again."" He adds: ""It gives you the power, the empowerment to say: ""You know what I'm worth a lot more than what's happening right now."" Marvin Coine, one of the first choir members, has seen some of that empowerment touch his own life. He was on the streets for two years, having to sleep under bridges before a shelter took him in. Coine is very frank about his prospects if he hadn't found the Atlanta Homeward Choir: ""I'd still be on the streets, I'd still be walking up and down the street trying to do something."" He was offered a job by someone that came to see a performance. He now has a steady income and is able to provide for his 14-year-old daughter. Audience member Martin McGrail, who calls the choir's music ""true art,"" says seeing Atlanta Homeward makes him want to make a difference against homelessness. ""We have to say to ourselves that there's got to be a solution that doesn't involve people freezing in the streets in the winter, it's just unacceptable in a modern society,"" he says. Besides concerts, the choir rehearses twice a week. Noonan walks the men back to the shelter after each practice. ""It really does break my heart that when I say goodbye to these guys in the evenings, that they don't have a home to go to,"" Noonan says. ""I get to go home, but they don't get to go home."" But amidst the heartbreak, there are also moments to celebrate. As rehearsal begins to wind down, a choir member has been given a solo in one of the performances. Noonan changes his tune: Now, he says with a smile, ""You can be all Mariah.""","Donal Noonan started the Atlanta Homeward Choir, made up of homeless men .

"(CNN)The former imperial capital of Hue sits just below what was once the demilitarized zone between North and South Vietnam and was, near the end of the war, the site of some of its fiercest fighting. You've seen it in newsreel footage -- and recreated (in England) in Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket."" It's one of the few areas of Vietnam I've never been. Hue is, in many ways, a city of ghosts, of memories and spirits -- and we play on that in Sunday's episode. It begins with a camera movement inside a ""Spirit House"" -- the dollhouse-sized shrines that many believers keep outside their homes and businesses. The Vietnamese are largely ancestor worshippers. Helping your deceased relatives into the next life -- and making sure they are happy while there -- is important. On special days and holidays, families visit temples and pagodas and leave offerings, often food, sometimes replicas of money or appliances or luxuries for the departed. Things they liked in life that might make the afterlife more comfortable. Spirit houses, as I understand them, are designed to deal with the problem of hungry, dissatisfied spirits who may not be settled, who have, for one reason or another, unfinished business left behind. They sit out front, or near the house or store, usually filled with incense and offerings, in the hope of distracting the spirits away from the main destination. In the weeks following the initial North Vietnamese taking of the city of Hue, many hundreds -- if not thousands -- of citizens, deemed dangerous or counterrevolutionary or otherwise undesirable, were summarily executed and buried in unmarked mass graves by the communist forces. When the United States Marines and army of South Vietnam retook the city, it was only at the end of brutal, house-to-house fighting and finally, airstrikes, that Hue was retaken -- flattening much of the city in the process. Many, many people were lost, their bodies never identified or recovered. This, the inability to find the physical remains of a relative, is a particular agony to Vietnamese. For this reason, this episode is haunted by ghosts. We hadn't intended it to be so. But that definitely emerged as a theme. You feel it as you drive the streets and early morning rice paddies on a scooter, walk the parapets of the ancient citadel, look at the flag hanging in the mist across the Perfume River. At one point, a young woman I'm having dinner with casually mentions that her mother doesn't like her to go out after dark. Too many ghosts. I don't want you to think that this episode of ""Parts Unknown"" is some kind of a bummer -- a depressing discussion of a war about which there are still strong feelings and disagreements here. It's not. One of the crazily awesome, incongruous things about Vietnam that I've found from the first time I visited is how friendly, welcoming, quick to move beyond the past the Vietnamese are. It is an incredibly beautiful country. One filled with passionate, proud cooks, and opinionated, enthusiastic eaters. You will see me with some old friends -- and you will, as always in Vietnam, see me eating some amazing food. And if you thought pho was the best thing ever? Wait 'til you see Bun Bo Hue.","Anthony Bourdain returns to a country he's loved since his first visit .

"Global health experts on Friday declared the Ebola epidemic ravaging West Africa an international health emergency that requires a coordinated global approach. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are battling the Ebola virus, which has also spread to Nigeria. The virus  has killed 961 people from the start of the outbreak this year through Wednesday, the World Health Organization said. ""The possible consequences of further international spread are particularly serious in view of the virulence of the virus, the intensive community and health facility transmission patterns, and the weak health systems in the currently affected and most at-risk countries,"" WHO said Friday after two days of emergency meetings. The U.N. health agency described it as the worst outbreak in the four-decade history of tracking the disease. ""A coordinated international response is deemed essential to stop and reverse the international spread of Ebola,"" WHO said. Ebola virus: 9 things to know about the killer disease . Medical aid groups applauded the designation but said that it alone won't reduce fatalities. ""Declaring Ebola an international public health emergency shows how seriously WHO is taking the current outbreak, but statements won't save lives,"" said Dr. Bart Janssens, director of operations for Doctors Without Borders, a humanitarian organization. ""Now we need this statement to translate into immediate action on the ground. For weeks, MSF has been repeating that a massive medical, epidemiological and public health response is desperately needed to save lives and reverse the course of the epidemic,"" said Janssens, using the initials for his organization's French name, Medecins Sans Frontieres. ""Lives are being lost because the response is too slow."" The agency said it has nearly 700 staff responding to the crisis in the affected countries. ""All our Ebola experts are mobilized, we simply cannot do more,"" Janseens said. American patients improving . Two Americans who contracted Ebola while supporting efforts to fight the disease in Liberia are showing improvement at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Dr. Kent Brantly and aid worker Nancy Writebol are getting treatment at one of four U.S. institutions capable of providing such treatment. WHO warns of bogus information . Meanwhile, a WHO official said bogus information is adding to the rapid spread of the disease. ""Perhaps one of the most important factors contributing to this is fear and misinformation,"" said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, assistant director for health security. ""This is critical to understand, because what it is doing is that it helps foster suspicion and anxiety in communities, and when that happens we see a situation where people are reluctant to go to health facilities or maybe reluctant to bring their family members there."" Though infectious, Ebola ""is not  mysterious"" and can be contained, Fukuda said. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said the fast-spreading disease has overwhelmed her nation's health care system. ""The scope and scale of the epidemic ... now exceed the capacity and statutory responsibility of any one government agency or ministry,"" she said.

"Growing up in Louisiana and Texas in the home of a part-time deputy sheriff, guns were a constant presence in Robin's childhood. Her father's hunting rifles were not hidden in a safe but proudly displayed in a cabinet, she said. When he wasn't wearing his pistol, it hung in his holster from a rocking chair in the living room in case he needed it -- and a shotgun sat atop the refrigerator for further defense. Robin, who asked that her last name not be used to protect her family's privacy, was 5 years old when she fired her first round from a real gun under her father's instruction -- a .38 special bullet from a .357 Magnum. He had seen her laughing while using her BB gun and didn't think she took guns seriously. He brought a container of red Kool-Aid out to the yard as a target. She missed, but remembers being ""knocked on her caboose"" by the force of the shot. She also remembers watching the jug explode as her father hit the target with a .410 shotgun. Read more: Gun violence task force begins work . ""After that, guns were respected and not handled unless given permission and with supervision,"" said the 37-year-old married mother of three from Locust Grove, Georgia. ""I had a healthy fear of them, but was not afraid of them."" As she and her husband started a family, there was never a question as to whether firearms would be in the home or whether their children would learn how to use them, she said. Last week's school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, has renewed debate over the wisdom of keeping guns in homes with children in light of information that alleged shooter Adam Lanza grew up with guns and went target shooting with his mother. While some studies show that keeping a gun in the home increases the risk of injury and death, a recent Pew survey found a higher percentage of Americans saying that gun ownership does more to protect people from crime (48%) than put their safety at risk (37%). Read more: In just seconds, a boy, a gun, a death, then grief . A 1998 study of injuries and death due to firearms in the home found that for every time a gun in the home was used in a self-defense or legally justifiable shooting, there were four unintentional shootings, seven criminal assaults or homicides, and 11 attempted or completed suicides. While some Americans rethink gun control, Robin said the the Sandy Hook shooting has confirmed her belief that it's her job to protect her children and teach them to defend themselves. She has no intention of getting rid of her firearms and still plans on giving her sons BB guns as Christmas gifts. ""It has reinforced the idea that a madman can grab a gun and use it; it has reinforced my desire to have a way to protect my children,"" she said. ""We know that guns don't kill people, bad people do. As responsible parents, it is our job to protect our family, and the best way to do that is to be prepared and armed, if that time comes."" Read more: Masculinity, mental illness and guns: A lethal equation? She's not alone. Robin and other parents who keep firearms in the home say the lesson of the Sandy Hook tragedy is not that we need more gun control but that we need more parental involvement in children's lives. Parents should teach children how to deal with guns responsibly. ""A healthy fear and respect for guns is what is needed in America,"" she said. ""It's up to us as parents to help our children understand that these are not toys, but not to be afraid of them if they ever need to use them."" Assessing a child's mental and physical capacity to use a gun is the first step in determining whether to place one in their hands, said firearms instructor Tim Mulheron, who is certified by the National Rifle Association as an instructor in pistol, rifle and shotgun safety. Knowing whether a child can be trusted around guns should also determine where parents keep them. ""If you have an environment where you don't trust your kids, you shouldn't have guns out, and it's the parent's responsibility to assess that,"" he said. Mulheron introduced his daughter to firearms when she was 9 by letting her help clean parts, he said. Sitting kids down and taking the gun apart so they can learn what each piece helps gauge their willingness to learn, he said. If they appear to genuinely listen, they're ready to move on, he said. ""Teaching your kids how guns work and to understand what they do and what happens when they go off is very important,"" he said. ""Kids have an incurable curiosity -- that's the first thing that gets everyone in trouble. If you train a child it takes the mystery away so they know what is and see what it does."" Read more: Will media stay focused on gun story? From there, the instruction is the same as it is for adults, he said. He takes them through the four rules of gun safety and how to load and unload ammunition, before moving on to how to pick up, hold and aim a gun. Only then does he consider taking them to the range. The NRA offers a program that teaches children steps to take if they find a gun -- stop, don't touch, leave the area and tell an adult. Otherwise, there's no hard age limit or minimum on when to begin introducing children to firearms, he said. It's up to a parent to decide when a child is physically able to hold a firearm and mentally prepared to understand its consequences. ""As a responsible parent, you shouldn't own guns without the proper mindset and awareness of what your children can and cannot do,"" he said. Westley McDuffie gave his son his first .22 caliber single shot rifle last Christmas, when the boy was 6 years old. His daughter, who is now 6, might get one from her grandfather for Christmas this year. The family lives on two acres of land in Loganville, Georgia, where McDuffie has set up metal targets for his children to practice on. Both of his children have demonstrated that they can follow directions and respect basic firearm safety, leading McDuffie to decide they have earned their own weapons. After all, if they're going to handle guns, they need ones that fit them right, he said. Kids and guns: What's your parenting style? McDuffie, retired from the U.S. Army, has a personal stash of 15 pistols, shotguns and rifles (kept out of children's reach, he said) for target practice and home protection. They live far out in the country, he said, too long a drive to wait for law enforcement to come in an emergency. ""The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,"" he said.

McDuffie and Robin agreed that they would not allow their children access to firearms if they had behavioral issues or did not appear to respect weapons.

Taking a few minutes to share their story with us could propel them to worldwide recognition. Maybe someone's selflessness has directly impacted your life. In 2013, Destiny Bush nominated her mentor and ""second mother,"" Tawanda Jones, whose drill team provides discipline and inspiration to thousands of children in the often violent city of Camden, New Jersey. ""It was important for the world to see this wonderful individual who commits herself effortlessly -- her heart, her body, her soul -- to our youth,"" said Bush, now a graduate student. Or maybe you know an individual in your community whose personal story and dedication inspires you. Denada Jackson's mom used to style Robin Emmons' hair. When Jackson bumped into Emmons years later, she learned about Emmons' efforts to help low-income neighborhoods access healthy, fresh food. ""It just seemed right that I would nominate her, because I've never seen anyone that happy about helping other people,"" Jackson said. ""She's making it happen for others in her community. Just to watch her be honored for that, to get a thank you, that was awesome."" But you don't have to personally know the individual you nominate. Just be familiar with their work. Johanna Robinette, for example, lives in the same small town as Dale Beatty, who helps build and modify homes for injured veterans. Robinette had heard about Beatty's organization, and she saw nominating him as a way to help draw attention to his efforts. ""To be able to take that time to do that, I was thankful that I did and thankful that (he was) honored in that way,"" Robinette said. ""It felt great to be a part of that."" It's easy to nominate an everyday person changing the world, but a thoughtful, well-written nomination is essential to help yours stand out from the thousands we receive.

"A Kentucky pastor who starred in a reality show about snake-handling in church has died -- of a snakebite. Jamie Coots died Saturday evening after refusing to be treated, Middlesboro police said. On ""Snake Salvation,"" the ardent Pentecostal believer said that he believed that a passage in the Bible suggests poisonous snakebites will not harm believers as long as they are anointed by God. The practice is illegal in most states, but still goes on, primarily in the rural South. Coots was a third-generation ""serpent handler"" and aspired to one day pass the practice and his church, Full Gospel Tabernacle in Jesus Name, on to his adult son, Little Cody. The National Geographic show featured Coots and cast handling all kinds of poisonous snakes -- copperheads, rattlers, cottonmouths. The channel's website shows a picture of Coots, goateed, wearing a fedora. ""Even after losing half of his finger to a snake bite and seeing others die from bites during services,"" Coots ""still believes he must take up serpents and follow the Holiness faith,"" the website says. A faithful death: Why a snake handler refused treatment . On Sunday, National Geographic Channels spokeswoman Stephanie Montgomery sent CNN this statement: ""In following Pastor Coots for our series Snake Salvation, we were constantly struck by his devout religious convictions despite the health and legal peril he often faced. ""Those risks were always worth it to him and his congregants as a means to demonstrate their unwavering faith.  We were honored to be allowed such unique access to Pastor Jamie and his congregation during the course of our show, and give context to his method of worship. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time."" In February 2013, Coots was given one year of probation for crossing into Tennessee with venomous snakes. He was previously arrested in 2008 for keeping 74 snakes in his home, according to National Geographic. Tennessee banned snake handling in 1947 after five people were bitten in churches over two years' time, the channel says on the show site. On one episode, Coots, who collected snakes, is shown trying to wrest a Western diamondback out of its nook under a rock deep in East Texas. He's wearing a cowboy hat and a T-shirt that says ""The answer to Y2K - JESUS."" The pastor is helped by his son and a couple of church members. ""He'll give up, just sooner or later,"" one of the members says. ""Just be careful. Ease him out."" The group bags two snakes, which a disappointed Coots says hardly justifies the trip to Texas. ""Catching two snakes the first day, 'course we'd hoped for more,"" Coots says in the video. ""We knew that the next day we was gonna have to try to hunt harder and hope for more snakes.""

"Chinese officials who accompanied Chinese President Xi Jinping on a visit to Tanzania last year went on a buying spree for illegal elephant ivory, an environmental activist group has claimed. The report by the Environmental Investigation Agency cites two local ivory traders as saying that the large Chinese government and business delegation bought so much ivory while in the country that prices doubled. The two traders claimed that a fortnight before the state visit, Chinese buyers began purchasing thousands of kilos of ivory, the report says. That ivory was later sent to China in diplomatic bags on the presidential plane, the dealers said, according to the report. One of the traders, named as Suleiman Mochiwa, told an undercover investigator for the EIA in September, ""The price was very high because the demand was high. When the guest come, the whole delegation, that's then time when the business goes up."" He said the price of ivory doubled during the Chinese visit to $700 per kilo. The second trader, named as Paulo Gavana, gave the same account. Groundless . Chinese authorities were less than impressed by the report. ""The report is groundless, and we express our strong dissatisfaction,"" said Hong Lei, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, at a press briefing on Thursday. ""We attach importance to the protection of wild animals like elephants. We have been cooperating with other countries in this area."" The sales were made by dealers operating out of the Mwenge Carvers Market in Dar es Salaam, the EIA claims. Another Mwenge dealer who spoke to undercover reporters in 2010 made similar claims about the entourage that accompanied past Chinese President Hu Jintao to Tanzania in 2009, the report said. He is quoted as saying: ""You know when the President of China, Hu Jintao, was coming to Tanzania? They come to take many things. But that was not for Hu Jintao, it was the whole group. Then they go direct to the airport, because VIP no-one checks your bags."" Slaughtered en masse . The report adds that going back as 2006, EIA investigators were told by Mwenge suppliers that Chinese Embassy staff were the major buyers of their ivory. The EIA report highlights the threat posed to Tanzania's elephant population by illegal poaching -- and warns that they are being ""slaughtered en masse"" to satisfy a growing demand for ivory. ""Based on available evidence, Tanzania has lost more elephants to poaching during this period than any other country. In 2013 alone, it reportedly lost 10,000 elephants, equivalent to 30 a day,"" it says. ""Tanzania's elephants continue to be poached to supply a growing demand in an unregulated illegal ivory market, predominantly in China.""","Environmental group claims Chinese delegation went on an ivory buying spree in Tanzania .

"The election of a new governor in Okinawa looks set to complicate controversial plans to relocate an unpopular U.S. air base on the Japanese island. Takeshi Onaga, a staunch opponent of the base, comfortably defeated the incumbent, Hirokazu Nakaima, in the vote on Sunday and quickly vowed to do everything he could to prevent the construction of the new facility for the U.S. Marines. ""I'm determined to work toward canceling and withdrawing it,"" he told reporters, according to the Japanese news agency Kyodo. Nakaima approved a key measure late last year for the transfer of the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, which is situated in a heavily populated area of Ginowan City. The base is unpopular with local residents. Many Okinawans feel the American military brings noise, crime and environmental damage to their island. A number of rape cases involving U.S. military personnel over the years have intensified the anger. About half of all U.S. military personnel in Japan are stationed on Okinawa. The U.S. and Japanese governments want to move the Marine base to a more sparsely populated area in Nago City and to build runways out into the sea for the new facility. But Onaga is calling for the base to be taken off Okinawa entirely. The defeat of Nakaima, who had the support of Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party, creates a headache for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Before Nakaima's approval last year, the relocation had been held up by local opposition since 1996, when Washington and Tokyo agreed on the original plan to move the base. Onaga said he plans to investigate the legal soundness of Nakaima's decision to give the go ahead for the land-fill work for the runways. ""We proved that the people of Okinawa disagree (with Nakaima),"" Onaga said. He received 360,820 votes to Nakaima's 261,076, Kyodo reported, citing the local election board.","Takeshi Onaga beats incumbent governor who approved measure for base construction .

"A new deadline for a political framework agreement for Iran's Nuclear talks has been set for March 1, 2015, a Western diplomat tells CNN on Monday, with a deadline for final agreement including annexes on July 1. Negotiators had been scrambling to reach a deal on Iran's nuclear program before a Monday night deadline. The negotiators included representatives from Iran and the P5+1 countries -- the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council (the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain), plus Germany. The parties involved will release a statement Monday citing ""good progress"" from their talks in Vienna, a Western diplomat told CNN. The negotiations will reconvene at a lower level -- below the level of foreign ministers -- in the coming weeks. A deal could have brought an end to significant sanctions against Tehran and a warming of relations with the West. The absence of a deal could ramp up tensions and could lead to more punitive measures -- and even confrontation -- over Iran's controversial nuclear program. Iran insists that like other countries, it has a right to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes. But Western powers have accused Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons as well. And the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who was not part of the Vienna talks, said last week that Iranian authorities continue denying his agency access to a sensitive military complex suspected of being a site of nuclear activities. Major disagreement . One of the primary sticking points in this round of talks has been how to lift sanctions against Iran. Hardliners in Iran have insisted that significant sanctions be lifted right away as a sign of good faith from the P5+1 countries. Such penalties, including banking and energy sanctions, would affect tens of billions of dollars. Earlier this month, 200 Iranian members of parliament signed a statement demanding that Iranian negotiators ""vigorously defend"" the country's nuclear rights and ensure a ""total lifting of sanctions."" International nuclear watchdog: Iran needs to cooperate . But P5+1 members have said they'd prefer to lift the sanctions incrementally so they can have leverage on Iran and to make sure Tehran makes good on its commitments to whatever deal is reached. Media in Tehran were skeptical about a resolution before the Monday night deadline. Reaching a deal by the deadline ""would be impossible"" based on the differences that remain between negotiators, the Iranian Students' News Agency reported Sunday, citing an unidentified Iranian official involved in the talks. Before Monday's extension of talks, a U.S. State Department official said negotiators had been ""chipping away"" at the issues. ""The focus of discussions remains on an agreement, but we are discussing both internally and with our partners a range of options for the best path forward,"" the official said. This isn't the first time negotiations over Iran's nuclear program have been extended. The previous deadline had been pushed back four months, to this round of talks. Pressure on both sides . Both Iranian and American officials will face a difficult political environment at home as they return without a deal. U.S. President Barack Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani have faced domestic political pressure to strike a deal. An extension could sharpen opposition both in the United States and in Iran. In the United States, Republicans will control the Senate in January, and lawmakers have threatened fresh sanctions on Iran if a deal is not reached. Although Obama has the power to veto, just the prospect of additional sanctions could drive Iran away from the table. Will Congress kill an Iran nuclear deal? Obama has said that if an agreement is reached, he thinks he can get the approval of Congress and Americans at large. ""I'm confident that if we reach a deal that is verifiable and assures that Iran does not have breakout capacity, that not only can I persuade Congress, but I can persuade the American people that it's the right thing to do,"" he said in an interview aired Sunday on  ABC's ""This Week."" But the senior U.S. State Department official told CNN on Sunday that the Iranians ""still have big decisions that need to be made.""","Western diplomat says new deadlines were set for March 1 and July 1 .

"It's a typically hot, humid August day in Bagan -- an ancient town in the heart of Myanmar's central Mandalay region. Once the capital of the Pagan Empire, today Bagan is an expanse of intricate temples and pagodas, erected by the ancient kings in their names and, as the once-isolated country opens up to the world, a major attraction for tourists. Outside the Dhammayangyi Temple -- the largest in Bagan -- a small girl runs up to me smiling, her hair slicked back into a ponytail and her cheeks streaked with tanaka. ""Madam, 'Burmese Days?' Good book,"" she proclaims, pushing a copy of it into my hands. ""Do you like this book?"" I ask her. ""Yes, but I only read little bit,"" she said, nodding. ""My English not good. This is too difficult for me. But for you good price, madam."" The fact that a girl was gleefully selling me George Orwell's ""Burmese Days"" in broad daylight at a tourist attraction is quite remarkable for Myanmar. Heavy-handed government censorship of literature meant that, though the book was always available, it was redacted and frowned upon for its negative portrayal of the Burmese people. In 2012, an original translation of the book -- intact and uncut -- was finally awarded a National Literary Award. That version of the book is now openly available, marking a big step forward for this country. Stifled environment . Under Myanmar's decades-long military rule that ended up isolating the country from the outside world and squandering its potential as a global player, authorities tried to suppress free thought and dissent by maintaining control over what people read and the information that was available across the country. But the British Council library -- a symbol of the country's colonial rule until it gained independence in 1948 -- was a safe haven of information. For years, visitors could get their hands on books that were banned in the country, including ""Love and Sunshine in the East"" (1930), an obscure novel by Janet Aldis, and more recently ""The Voice of Hope,"" (1997) pro-democracy politician Aung San Suu Kyi's inspiring tale of her years under house arrest. Many books were carefully retained and protected by Monica Mya Muang, an English woman who married a Burmese barrister and moved to the country in 1937, at a difficult time when marriages between locals and foreigners were frowned upon. In 1962, Myanmar's first independent government party to take power through elections was ousted in a coup d'état by the military, led by General Ne Win. As the military consolidated its control, the original British Council library was closed down. At that point, Monica Mya Muang managed to salvage and move a handful of books into the British Embassy building, where the library now lives and has since expanded into a large collection. Years later, when the Internet finally arrived in Myanmar and the country was still under the control of the military junta, the library was one of the few places where users could access international news and uncensored information, says Susana Galvan, director of Education and Arts at the British Council. Members would even safely hold political discussions and dialogues at the library. ""The irony is that we were allowed to keep the library open,"" Galvan adds. Scattered education . In 1988, ill-conceived economic policies by the military government sparked protests, led by students and monks, that gripped major cities across the country, particularly in the former capital Yangon. Despite the peaceful nature of the protests, the military cracked down hard. Curfews were imposed and universities shuttered as the authorities moved to ban political discussions and gatherings among students that encouraged dissent. Most university courses were reduced to distance-learning centers scattered across the country, providing little opportunity to engage with professors and fellow students. ""Pretty much all undergraduate programs were taken via distance learning. And they were of poor quality: it involved mainly memorizing and regurgitating material,"" says Galvan. The public library system also disintegrated, receiving little funding or attention. A local library I visited in Bagan was a case in point -- bookshelves creaking under the weight of unloved, mildew-covered books, most of them obscure and unrecognizable. According to a survey by the Asia Foundation, almost 90% of books at libraries such as this one are religious texts. ""A lot of libraries are still closed or not up to date. They are usually very heavily reliant on book donations and a lot of those donations are irrelevant,"" says Galvan. Yet, people were gathered inside and outside the building, reading newspapers, chatting and using the free (extremely patchy) wifi offered there. It was clearly a communal spot for the town. Signs of Hope . In a way, the state and evolution of libraries and literature is a litmus test of Myanmar's development and change since the military leadership formally stepped aside in 2011 -- as the new translation of ""Burmese Days"" shows. In 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi established the non-profit Daw Khin Kyi Foundation -- mobile libraries set up to compensate for the crumbling libraries. Vans bring a collection of over 15,000 books to the more remote areas of the country, encouraging people of all ages to delve into the literary world. Another milestone came in December last year when Yangon University started to take undergraduates on campus again -- the first time since the crackdown, breathing new life into the abandoned institution. Owing to the neglected state of the university's library, an ""e-library"" was introduced in January this year, allowing unprecedented access to thousands of up-to-date journals, textbooks and novels from organizations around the world, such as the Cambridge and Oxford journals databases. ""The first time I actually went to Yangon University in June last year, the campus was dead. There was not a single student in sight, the library materials were old, the furniture was stacked up,"" says Galvan. ""But a lot has changed in a year."" Seeking to catch up with the outside world in economic terms, the civilian government has embraced the need for widespread education and freedom of thought. And investing in its human capital by slowly bolstering the libraries and universities across this vast country that were on once the verge of collapse is key to this.","Much of Myanmar's literature was banned as military suppressed freedom of thought .
The country was left with thousands of libraries following British colonial rule .
In the past few years, some library buildings had re-opened under the civilian government .

"DNA pioneer James Watson is to sell the Nobel Prize he won for his co-discovery of the double helix structure, the building block of life. The coveted gold medal is expected to go under the hammer for up to $3.5 million in a sale at Christie's in New York on December 4. It will be the first time a Nobel Prize has been sold by a living recipient. Watson, now 85, was awarded the medal for work in the field of physiology or medicine alongside fellow scientists Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins in 1962. The scientist's notes for his acceptance speech at the Nobel ceremony in Stockholm and the manuscript of his Nobel lecture are also on offer at the auction. New life engineered with artificial DNA . Watson and Crick worked together on the structure of DNA at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory in the early 1950s. ""He was the first person I met who I could really talk to,"" Watson said in 2013. ""I'd met people, but they didn't share my conviction that only DNA was important."" In 1953, the pair came to the conclusion that DNA was formed by two twisted strands of molecules, like the rungs of a ladder, holding the iconic double helix structure together. ""All we could say when we got it: It's so beautiful!"" Watson said. 'DNA was my only gold rush,' says Watson . The discovery, which explained how DNA stores information and how it is replicated, changed biology forever and revolutionized medicine. ""Everything we do since then is more or less based on that structure,"" Mario Capecchi, professor of genetics and human biology at the University of Utah and a former graduate student of Watson's, said last year. Announcing the sale, Christie's auction house said Watson's work was ""On a par with Newton, Darwin and Einstein, (and his) unyielding quest for knowledge led to discoveries that forever altered human history."" The lucrative allure of the double helix . Watson says he intends to use part of the money raised by the sale to fund projects at the universities and scientific research institutions he has worked at throughout his career. ""I look forward to making further philanthropic gifts to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, the University of Chicago, and Clare College Cambridge,"" he said in a statement. He added that the auction would mean he could ""continue to do my part in keeping the academic world an environment where great ideas and decency prevail."" Last year, Francis Crick's ""Secret of Life"" letter to his son, in which he explained the structure of DNA weeks before the discovery was officially announced in the April 1953 edition of the journal Nature, was sold for $6.06 million. The world record price -- more than three times its pre-sale estimate -- made it the most expensive letter ever sold at auction.

"It's a chilling figure: 191,369 men, women and children reported killed in Syria between March 2011 and the end of April 2014. The figure, the result of a new analysis for the United Nations, is a significant increase on the last update provided by the United Nations, but even so it is probably less than the true number of those killed. It prompted U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay to slam the inaction by the U.N. Security Council that has allowed the slaughter to continue unabated. ""The killers, destroyers and torturers in Syria have been empowered and emboldened by the international paralysis,"" she said in a statement Friday. ""There are serious allegations that war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed time and time again with total impunity, yet the Security Council has failed to refer the case of Syria to the International Criminal Court, where it clearly belongs."" Pillay pointed out that the total number of killings is more than double the number documented a year ago. But, she said, ""tragically it is probably an underestimate of the real total number of people killed during the first three years of this murderous conflict."" She added, ""I deeply regret that, given the onset of so many other armed conflicts in this period of global destabilization, the fighting in Syria and its dreadful impact on millions of civilians has dropped off the international radar."" The new U.N. figure is based on analysis of 318,910 reported killings, in which the name of the victim, as well as the date and location of the death, had to be documented. Five different sources of data were used to confirm details and exclude repetitions. The largest number of documented killings was in the Damascus countryside, with nearly 40,000, with the next highest numbers recorded in Aleppo, with nearly 32,000, and Homs with just over 28,000. About 85% of those killed were male and 9.3% were female. The analysis was not able to distinguish between combatants and noncombatants, the United Nations said. At least 8,803 children are documented as having been killed, including more than a quarter who were under 10 years old. However, the real total is likely to be higher, the statement said, because the victims' ages have not been recorded in more than 80% of cases. Pillay called for governments to take ""serious measures to halt the fighting and deter the crimes, and above all stop fueling this monumental, and wholly avoidable, human catastrophe through the provision of arms and other military supplies."" Russia, a longstanding ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has repeatedly blocked U.N. sanction resolutions on Syria.

"Mosul Province, Iraq (CNN) -- Kurdish forces fired mortars and explosives at extremist militants Sunday as the battle to retake a strategic dam in northern Iraq raged on. Smoke rose from the horizon, buildings were ablaze and the sound of massive explosions filled the air near Mosul Dam. By Sunday evening, the Kurdish forces -- known as the Peshmerga -- had taken over the eastern side of the structure, a spokesman for the group said. Clashes were ongoing over the western side, Peshmerga spokesman Halgord Hikmat told CNN. The forces face a daunting challenge: fighting a fierce offensive to retake the dam without damaging it. U.S. warplanes joined the effort amid growing concern that the facility is not maintained and could rupture, a U.S. official told CNN. Engineering studies show that a failure of the dam would be catastrophic, resulting in flooding all the way to Baghdad, the official said on condition of anonymity. Iraq's largest hydroelectric dam, the facility on the Tigris River about 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of the city of Mosul is a key source of electricity, irrigation and flood protection. ISIS fighters seized it this month, and they were digging in Sunday to keep their grip, using snipers, land mines and other explosives in their efforts to fend off advancing forces. The United States estimates there may be up to 400 ISIS fighters in and around the dam complex, the official said. And members of the Peshmerga said Sunday that they were worried that the militants could try to sabotage the dam. Militants of ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, set up high-powered explosives around buildings and detonated them, Kurdish Intelligence chief Masrour Barzani said. Kurdish forces fought back, sparking clashes. ""We believe our Peshmerga can take (the dam) back because this is something very, very dangerous,"" Barzani said. U.S. military forces used ""a mix of fighter, bomber, attack and remotely piloted aircraft to successfully conduct airstrikes near the Mosul Dam"" on Sunday, according to U.S. Central Command. Map: Where is ISIS? President Barack Obama justified the airstrikes in a letter to Congress the same day. ""These military operations will be limited in their scope and duration as necessary to support the Iraqi forces in their efforts to retake and establish control of this critical infrastructure site,"" the letter read. ""The failure of the Mosul Dam could threaten the lives of large numbers of civilians, endanger U.S. personnel and facilities, including the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, and prevent the Iraqi government from providing critical services to the Iraqi populace,"" it continued. A Peshmerga colonel told CNN the operation began early Saturday with Kurdish forces advancing toward the dam as the United States carried out airstrikes. The U.S. military confirmed a mix of fighter jets and drones carried out nine airstrikes on Saturday near Mosul and the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil. On Sunday, the U.S. military conducted 14 airstrikes in Iraq, damaging or destroying ISIS militants' vehicles, armored personnel carriers and a checkpoint, Central Command. Videos released by the military showed two airstrikes near the Mosul Dam -- one hitting an armed truck, the other hitting a Humvee. The dam complex has not been hit, the colonel said on condition of anonymity. He is not authorized to speak to the media. Mosul Dam is under ISIS control, but it is still up and running, the colonel said. Engineers and employees remain at work, he said. U.S. intelligence agencies, according to the U.S. official, are also keeping an eye on the Haditha Dam on the Euphrates River in Iraq's western Anbar province, where Iraqi troops have been holding off an ISIS assault for weeks. The dam is the second-largest in the country, and it provides water to western and southern Iraq. Earlier this year, ISIS fighters opened the gates on the Falluja dam after seizing it in an effort to stop an Iraqi military advance. The water from the dam flooded a number of villages. CNN military analyst retired Maj. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks said it's likely ISIS wants to keep the Mosul Dam in working order. ""You don't want to have the cataclysmic event where, if this dam were to break, you would run the risk of flooding downstream along the Tigris,"" he said. ""I would think that ISIS wants to retain control of that dam and would want to maintain its integrity, because it generates this electric power and they want to be able to sue that as a weapon system to those who are under their control."" U.S. President Barack Obama ordered targeted airstrikes to protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq and prevent a potential genocide of ethnic and religious minority groups by ISIS. Last week, Obama declared an end to an ISIS siege that had trapped tens of thousands of Yazidis in mountains, citing the success of targeted American airstrikes.

"The world comes to New York this week, accompanied by baggage full of crises. It's the 69th annual United Nations General Assembly special debate, and it has not been a peaceful year. The 120-plus presidents and prime ministers maneuvering through New York City traffic will be grappling with issues such as ISIS, Ebola and Ukraine in their public speeches and private diplomacy. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said, ""the world is facing multiple crises. Each has its own dynamics and requires its own approach."" There are 193 states in the United Nations. However, it's what the President of the United States does and says that tends to dominate the proceedings. President Barack Obama will be here for 48 hours. Not enough time to solve the world's problems. The U.S. leader's top priority will be terrorism. A Security Council meeting he will chair on ISIS and the threat posed by foreign fighters is a centerpiece of U.S. efforts here. The United States is hoping to get unanimous approval for a legally binding resolution compelling countries to crack down on their citizens departing to join ISIS and other militant groups and block them from returning to threaten their native countries using passports already granted. Obama is likely to focus his Wednesday morning speech to the General Assembly on ISIS and call for the world to come to the aid of a new under threat Iraqi government. What is ISIS? It's a different tone regarding the United States, the United Nations and Iraq. President George W. Bush was not cheered in the General Assembly after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Now, France is aggressively on the side of Washington. The usually quarreling big powers in the Security Council can find common ground against a common enemy. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told the Security Council on Friday, ""I don't need to remind anyone here that the last two times the eyes of the world were focused on Iraq was when its government was in confrontation with the international community, with great consequences. Today, however, we come together in support of the new Iraqi government."" A health menace also on the minds of world leaders is Ebola. Leaders of some of the most affected countries will be attending. U.N. authorities are counting on the African countries to provide screening of travelers heading to the General Assembly summit. Obama and other world leaders will plot further strategies at a Thursday session on Ebola.  Never before has a health issue prompted U.N. emergency sessions and a fast-paced, urgent response to slow Ebola's spread that still requires more money, doctors and anti-Ebola supplies. 9 things to know about Ebola . Ukraine and Russia tensions may have eased, but fears remain among many leaders regarding Russia's future intentions. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko will appeal to the General Assembly to not let Ukraine stand alone. President Vladimir Putin of Russia is not attending. U.S. and Russian ambassadors to the United Nations once again exchanged sharp criticism of each country's position on the downing of Malaysia Flight 17 in a public U.N. meeting Friday. Under the radar but not in terms of importance is climate change. Ban Ki-moon feels it's the No. 1 crisis overall. On Tuesday, he will lead a special day of focus on climate. Obama will speak a day ahead of his traditional General Assembly remarks. However, the leaders of India and China -- two countries that advocates say could do more to limit carbon emissions -- are not expected to attend on climate day, though will be represented by ministers. Climate change: 'I'm on the front lines of the crisis' Making a titanic appearance on the rostrum of the Assembly will be actor Leonardo DiCaprio, an environmental activist and named last week as a U.N. messenger of peace. It's always hard to measure the success of one of these international talkfests. Several foreign ministers have said it's like ""speed-dating diplomacy"" -- five minutes with this country, five minutes with that government minister. Kerry reminded the Security Council on Friday that good diplomacy requires patience. If it is indeed international speed dating, then expect lots of frustration while praying for a successful outcome.","Expect ISIS and Ebola to be major topics at this week's General Assembly special debate .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Even by the standards of the anything-goes MTV Video Music Awards, Kanye West's hijacking of country-pop sweetheart Taylor Swift's speech at the Sunday night ceremony was particularly brutal. Kanye West takes the microphone from Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday. The pre-show buzz had focused on the highly anticipated tribute to the late Michael Jackson, but West's disruption stole the spotlight. A giddy Swift was in the midst of her acceptance speech for Best Female Video when the often-mercurial West rushed onstage, grabbed her microphone and let loose an outburst on behalf of singer Beyonce Knowles, who had lost out in that category. But audiences who stayed tuned until the end of the broadcast were treated to a touching bookend: Knowles, the night's top winner, invited Swift onstage and gave the teen singer her moment in the spotlight.  Watch Kanye interrupt Swift, Beyonce react » . ""I remember being 17 years old, up for my first MTV award with Destiny's Child, and it was one of the most exciting moments of my life,"" Knowles said, referring to the girl group with which she had her start. ""So I would like for Taylor to come out and have her moment."" Speaking to reporters later, Swift was understated about her take on the disruption. ""I was excited to be onstage because I just won the award. And then I was excited that Kanye West was onstage. Then, I wasn't excited anymore,"" she said.  Watch Swift's reaction after disruption » . MTV told journalists the West-Swift incident was not planned -- a point it had to stress after a walkout by singer Eminem at last year's event turned out to be staged. Hip-hop superstar West, who was pictured before the ceremony swigging a bottle of Cognac, was escorted from the building after the rant, the network said. Soon after, an apology to Swift appeared on his blog: . ""I'm sooooo sorry to Taylor Swift and her fans and her mom,"" the message said in all caps. ""I spoke to her mother right after and she said the same thing my mother would've said. She is very talented! ... I'm in the wrong for going on stage and taking away from her moment!"" So went the 2009 edition of the awards, a show that is historically less remembered for its winners than for its antics. And as usual, the Sunday night spectacle, hosted by a not-particularly funny Russell Brand, delivered: . • Pink dangled upside down from the rafters as she belted out ""Sober"" -- upping the ante from last year, when she shimmied down a bed sheet from a second-story fire escape. •  Lady Gaga, apparently pressing home her feelings about celebrity photographers, dabbed at fake blood that dripped from her ribcage and smeared it on her face as she sang ""Paparazzi."" •  And Swift took the subway, from the 42nd Street station to a stage outside the show venue Radio City Music Hall, all the while singing ""You Belong With Me.""  See guests arrive to awards show » . The ceremony was as much an awards show as a reverential tribute to Michael Jackson, who died on June 25. Madonna got the evening off to a bittersweet beginning as she recounted how she forged a friendship with the singer and how they gradually grew distant. ""When Michael Jackson was 6, he became a superstar and was perhaps the world's most beloved child. When I was 6, my mother died,"" she began. ""I think he got the shorter end of the stick. I never had a mother, but he never had a childhood."" After Madonna's tribute, an army of dancers re-created dance moves from several of Jackson's music videos.  Watch highlights from the show » . As his single ""Scream"" beamed from a large overhead screen, Jackson's sister Janet came out and sang along to the only duet the siblings recorded. The show also gave fans their first look at ""This Is It,"" a behind-the-scenes documentary of Jackson's final three months. The two-and-a-half-minute trailer made clear the elaborate comeback show the singer was planning before he died. But the much-publicized sneak peek was overshadowed by Kanye West's tantrum. ""Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'm gonna let you finish, but Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time,"" he said, snatching the microphone from  Swift after she had won her award. Swift stood onstage, speechless, clutching her award. The cameras panned to a shocked Beyonce, while the audience booed and later chanted ""Taylor."" Though Beyonce later afforded the teen singer another opportunity to finish her speech, the West backlash had begun. ""F--- u Kanye,"" said a tweet on Katy Perry's Twitter feed. ""It's like you stepped on a kitten."" Pink's Twitter feed made several references to the incident. ""Kanye west is the biggest piece of s--- on earth. Quote me,"" one tweet said. Of course, West is no stranger to award show outbursts. He made a similar uninvited appearance onstage at the 2006 MTV Europe Music Awards when he was snubbed for his single ""Touch the Sky."" He leaped onstage, saying his video deserved to win because it ""cost a million dollars and Pamela Anderson was in it."" On his blog Sunday, West pleaded his case: ""I gave my awards to Outkast when they deserved it over me,"" he said, referring to the 2007 BET Awards, when he tried to give his trophy to the band. ""I'm not crazy y'all, I'm just real.""","Kanye West interrupts Taylor Swift's acceptance speech, apologizes on blog .

"More than 60 million American adults -- one in every four -- suffer from some form of mental illness, ranging from panic disorders to depression, according to mental health professionals. Nearly 14 million live with a serious mental illness, such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and severe depression. Americans often don't know where to turn when dealing with a loved one with serious mental illness, but there are resources available. Here are a few of those: . • The National Alliance on Mental Illness provides a program geared toward healthy living strategies and skill-building resources for adults. The course is free, confidential and led by trained individuals in recovery from mental illness. The organization also facilitates a discussion group called Teen Consumers, which provides a healthy environment for teenagers to discuss their diagnoses and treatments. The National Alliance on Mental Illness also offers support groups for parents of teens with mental illness. The nonprofit's website provides a state-by-state directory of local support groups. It has a hotline for general information, referrals and support: 800-950-6264. Its hours of operation are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET weekdays. • The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention is a nonprofit organization dedicated to  bringing together people and communities to ""understand and prevent suicide, and to help heal the pain it causes."" Those in crisis can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255 to talk to a counselor. • The Treatment Advocacy Center is a nonprofit that works to promote policies that support people with severe mental illness. Its website features links to connect families and individuals to treatment options, legal resources and crisis response strategies. • Treatment Before Tragedy is a new nonprofit organization dedicated to helping the most seriously mentally ill and their families. The group's mission statement is to advocate ""for better treatment, services, research and a cure for individuals and families impacted by serious mental illness."" • The Balanced Mind Parent Network offers support for parents and guardians of children with mood disorders. The nonprofit provides online support groups, a professional resource directory and a help line in which families can submit questions to trained parent volunteers. The network's website lists 28 support groups to address the needs of all ages -- from toddler to young adults suffering from depression or bipolar disorder as well as to their family members. The organization aims to see children thrive in spite of their disorders by receiving proper care and the support they deserve.","Mental health professionals: One in four U.S. adults suffer from mental disorders .

"(CNN) -- There's no skirting around the issue -- short shorts, long shorts -- it doesn't matter to the biggest name in women's football, Marta. Who better to talk about the struggles facing the sport than the woman known across the world as ""the female Pele?"" In fact, if you ask Pele himself, largely acknowledged to be the greatest player to have ever kicked a football, he will tell you that he calls her ""Pele with skirts."" Unlike the suggestion of FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who said in 2004 that women soccer players could wear skimpier outfits to make the sport more appealing, Pele's comment was taken as a compliment. ""Let the women play in more feminine clothes like they do in volleyball,"" Blatter said at the time. ""They could, for example, have tighter shorts."" Which clothes players wear are irrelevant according to Marta -- but ensuring that women's football retains a sense of femininity is important to the five-time FIFA World Player of the Year. ""I'm all in favor of us not losing our essence, our female side, because we are women and we have to be proud of that,"" the Brazil star told CNN's ""An Uneven Playing Field"" documentary. ""We have to have some vanity; we have to take care of ourselves and keep our spirits high. I think what really matters is the support you get in football regardless of the uniform you wear. ""Some girls feel good playing in long shorts while some of them feel good playing in tighter shorts. I'm not against it. It's obvious that women have to explore that female side of things and I don't think that's a mistake."" Campaigner . Marta is one of the most vocal campaigners in the battle for equality in women's football. Not bad for a girl who grew up in Dois Riachos, playing football on the streets against boys twice her size and without any formative coaching until the age of 14. Fast forward to 2013, and the 27-year-old is one of the most recognizable faces in the sport, starring for Swedish side Tyresö FF in Stockholm. Like Marta, women's football has come a long way too since it held its debut at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, where nearly 80,000 watched the U.S. win gold. Three years later, over 90,000 people were packed into the Pasadena Rose Bowl, California, for the 1999 World Cup as the U.S. defeated China. On the club front, the UEFA European Women's Champions League has been gaining in popularity since its inception in 2001. And yet still Marta believes that attitudes towards women within football have remained stuck in the past. Prejudice . ""I think it has changed a bit but that mentality still exists,"" she said. ""There's still prejudice and that resistance regarding women not only on female football but in various activities. ""Men think that women are a bit fragile to perform some types of activities or don't have the ability and aren't strong enough. ""That doesn't exist anymore. Women have shown they have capabilities in every sense better than men a lot of time, but it's that whole macho thing. ""Football in Brazil is seen as a masculine sport, even with a lot of people accepting the female sport. There's still a percentage that thinks like in the old days."" While women's football has struggled to gain its share of the limelight in Brazil, the sport is booming across the globe. According to the latest figures published by FIFA, the world's governing body, 29 million women and girls play football worldwide. That's a huge increase from 1971, when three international teams played just two matches -- by 2011 there were 129 teams playing 514 games. But while the women's game has grown in the U.S. and Europe, progress has been far more difficult to achieve in Brazil. Even the achievements of the national team, which has won two silver medals and finished as runner-up at the last World Cup, has not been enough to get the professional game off the ground. Fighting . ""When you have competitions like the Olympics or the World Cup, then it captures people's attention and that of the media,"" said Marta. ""But when that moment has passed and Brazil hasn't played well or won, then you lose that attention. ""Maybe that's what's missing for people who can do something for Brazilian female football, to actually wake up and change the reality of female football because we have three medals. ""Those three medals till today were useless because our reality hasn't changed that much. There were promises. There was a promise of starting a league, of doing this, of doing that, but in reality nothing was done and we are still fighting. ""We want to try and carry Brazil's name to the top but we don't have the support."" Marta was 21 when she played in front of a staggering 70,000 at Rio's famous Maracana Stadium -- an occasion where Brazil defeated the U.S. under-20 team in the final of the 2007 Pan American Games. But that attendance is an anomaly in a country where the game has little chance of competing for media attention against the constant frenzy surrounding men's football. Funding is scarce, sponsorship even more so, and while women's football is televised on a regular level in the U.S. in Europe, Brazil is still lagging behind. Marta, who has played in the U.S. and now in Sweden, has seen first hand the benefits of having sponsors and investment -- and now wants companies to invest in Brazil's women. Weaker sex . ""There's still the prejudice of thinking women are the weaker sex or that they weren't born to play sports,"" Marta said. ""I think people need to stop that and give us credit. ""I know that when people come to invest they want an immediate return, but that doesn't happen. ""There needs to be a schedule. With investment you will have television companies broadcasting the games and you will have more sponsorship. ""If we work on a project to bring more people to the stadium then television companies and sponsors will look at this and think it's a cool initiative. ""That will lead them to get even more involved. It has to be something where every side can be involved but it has to be out of solidarity and not to gain something out of female football, because at this point we can't really give away immediate return."" Hope . A lack of funding and investment combined with the demise of her former club, Santos, paints a bleak picture for the women's game in Brazil. But for someone who has broken down barriers from the very time she first touched a football as an inquisitive youngster, there is still hope. According to Marta, the Brazilian Football Association, the government and FIFA are all working together to establish a women's league which will be made possible through outside investment. ""There is hope for the future,"" she said. ""I hope they will create a league to give continuity and allow the girls to learn the basics so when they graduate to the national team, they are ready and developed. ""I really hope that happens, if not in my generation then in the ones that follow.""","Marta is considered to be one of the greatest female football players in history .

"(CNN) -- The death of Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan, who succumbed to Ebola in a Dallas hospital, is of course tragic. But the extraordinarily poor way his case appears to have been handled may also inadvertently have done the United States an enormous service -- not just in shining a light on the threat posed by this virus but also by revealing the profound problems both in our health care delivery system and the public health programs supposed to help prevent outbreaks, track contacts and control the spread of disease. Some of the hospital's actions -- including failing to communicate the level of concern for Duncan as a possible Ebola case, sending him home before properly evaluating him and possibly delaying in getting him medications that might have helped if given earlier -- were judgment errors that should never have happened. We can, I hope, presume that every hospital in the country took note -- and none would repeat those steps. And we should probably presume, as well, that the Dallas and Texas health departments will get their collective acts together. The fact that terrified family members and friends who had been in direct contact with Duncan were left to fend for themselves in an apartment filled with contaminated bedding, towels and surfaces for days is inexplicable. Then there was the announcement by top officials in Dallas that they were desperately trying to find good Samaritans to take the family into their homes. Really, was there no empty apartment in the city that could accommodate this family? I wish I could be confident that a similar set of problems would not have occurred elsewhere, but there is ample reason to believe that some version of the Dallas story could have happened in many other cities around the nation. So beyond the drama and attention directed at a single disease and foul-ups in care, the Obama administration and Congress have bigger and far more important actions to take with respect to making sure that we are ready to manage future large-scale public health crises. First, we need to restore -- if not increase -- federal funding for the Hospital Preparedness Program. The purpose of this program is to bolster hospital readiness to deal with major disasters, including serious epidemics. In 2003 and 2004, the program provided $515 million each year to fund preparedness initiatives in America's approximately 5,000 hospitals. A decade later, funding is forecast to fall to $255 million -- essentially half of what it had been. This is a problem because it takes money to develop disaster protocols, hire staff and do ongoing training to make sure our health care system is -- and remains -- ready for whatever catastrophe the future holds. And with more than one in three U.S. hospitals facing severe financial crises, this is not something that can happen without federal support. Congress needs to restore full funding for the Hospital Preparedness Program immediately. Second, while there may be some notable exceptions, like in New York and Los Angeles, severe funding cutbacks have put the vast majority of the nation's public health agencies in a state of serious fragility, truly lacking sufficient capacity to surge up at a time of a major public health crisis. How did this happen? Importantly, a federal initiative known as the Public Health Emergency Preparedness program has been cut back from a peak of about $900 million in 2005 to $610 million estimated this year. As a result, and exacerbated by many other program cutbacks, we are seeing a loss of some 50,000 public health workers in less than a decade. It's no wonder that so many health departments are struggling to keep up with routine functions, no less be adequately prepared and trained to respond to disasters. Ebola is clearly the latest ""disaster wake-up call."" But if history is any indication, we are likely to treat this by hitting the snooze button on the alarm. That means lots of media coverage -- and public anxiety -- until the reporters leave. Then it's back to our usual state of complacency without making the definitive changes we desperately need. Hopefully, this time will be different. But it will only be so if the administration and the Congress restore critical disaster preparedness funding and, simultaneously, restore the confidence of the American public that deserves better than what we saw in the weeks following Duncan's arrival in Dallas.","Death of Ebola patient in Dallas highlights problems in health system, Irwin Redlener says .

"Demonstrations in parts of Pakistan ostensibly about an anti-Islam film spiraled into chaos Friday, as mobs ransacked banks, cinemas and government offices and engaged in clashes with authorities that left at least 15 dead. The protests were not confined to Pakistan, as Muslims also hit the streets of Lebanon, Malaysia and Bangladesh. Nor was the target of their ire new: Muslim-led demonstrations have occurred daily since September 11 over an obscure, 14-minute trailer for a film that mocks the Prophet Mohammed as a womanizer, child molester and killer. Many protesters have vented their anger at the United States, where the ""Innocence of Muslims"" was privately produced, despite U.S. officials' condemnation of the video and insistence it was not sanctioned by Washington. And fresh fury has been stoked in recent days by French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo's decision to publish cartoons of a figure resembling Mohammed, prompting France to close diplomatic facilities in 20 countries Friday. Still, while many of the protests have been heated and at times violent, what transpired Friday in Pakistan was unique in its size and focus -- or lack thereof -- with local institutions targeted as well as international ones. Pakistani authorities effectively gave their blessing to protests -- even as others, including the Tunisian government, banned them on Friday fearing unrest -- ""by declaring a national holiday in protest of the film,"" noted Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf. And, indeed, tens of thousands answered the call. Most of them protested peacefully, with security forces out in large numbers as Interior Minister Rehman Malik warned Friday afternoon that  ""strict action"" would be taken against those who destroy property. Yet there were significant exceptions, with authorities reporting 78 injured in addition to 15 killed in Peshawar and Karachi alone. About 60,000 to 70,000 people turned out in the city of Mardan, a northwestern Pakistani city about 60 kilometers east of Peshawar, senior police official Khalif Nasim told CNN. After the crowd dispersed around 4 p.m. after Muslim prayers, an angry mob of about 700 teenagers broke into a church by storming past 15 police officers in the area, according to Nasim. After overcoming a security guard in the church, they vandalized and effectively destroyed the sanctuary, he added. Police responded with tear gas and by firing into the air, ultimately making ""several arrests and ... interrogating the hooligans,"" said Nasim. No one was hurt. Many other buildings in the same neighborhood were attacked and, in some cases, set afire, police noted. Abdul Wali, another police official, said protesters also broke into and vandalized a nearby university and several government buildings. In Karachi -- where, a day earlier, video showed about 100 children repeating an adult voice in chants such as ""Death to America"" and ""Any friend of America is a traitor"" -- angry protesters burned three cinemas and two banks, as well as set fire to tires in the streets. They also smashed windows and threw rocks at police who'd tried to keep them from government offices and shops, according to a senior police official. Protesters tried to reach the U.S. Consulate in Karachi, but police using tear gas and firing into the air turned them back, emergency spokesman Asif Farooqi said. Local television news channels showed protesters throwing rocks at a KFC restaurant in Karachi. KFC shuts down all its restaurants in Pakistan . The violence in the coastal city claimed at least nine lives, including at least two police officers, and injured 28 others, according to Farooqi. Two cinemas were torched in Peshawar, where six people died and at least 50 people were injured -- including three police officers -- according to Mujahid Khan, a spokesman for the city's emergency rescue service. Crowds of protesters also marched in Islamabad, and CNN affiliate Geo TV reported protests in Rawalpindi and Karachi. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton thanked the government of Pakistan for its efforts to protect U.S. facilities during the protests and deplored the loss of life. ""As I have said on numerous occasions, the violence we have seen cannot be tolerated,"" she said. Opinion: Protests as mindless as anti-Islam film . On the streets of downtown Islamabad, Pakistani citizens had mixed views on what fueled the protests. Voicing her opinion to an open microphone set up by CNN on Thursday in the Asian nation's capital, one woman said, ""They are angry about the movie. No one wants religion being insulted like that."" Yet others said the furor was rooted in more than just the video, with another woman noting ""many anti-religious movies have come out."" ""They're agitated because of ... poverty and unemployment"" and the deepening gap between rich and poor, she said. Opinion: #MuslimRage inspires comedic rage . More protests and one counter-protest . -- Hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators marched in Benghazi on Friday night and overtook the headquarters of Ansar al-Sharia, a radical Islamist group tied to the attack. They also claimed to have freed at least 20 captives held in the building. They took to the streets 10 days after U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi. -- Demonstrators turned out across Bangladesh on Friday to protest the film, according to the state-run BSS news agency. Video showed protesters in Dhaka carrying signs with slogans such as ""Kill us, but don't insult our Prophet Mohammed"" and burning a box draped in an American flag, labeled ""Cofin of Obama."" -- In Lebanon, supporters of Hezbollah, a militant Islamist group deemed a terrorist organization by the United States, marched Friday in a peaceful demonstration ""in support of the Prophet Mohammed,"" Hezbollah TV channel al-Manar reported. Video showed a stream of people marching slowly down the streets with signs reading, ""Loyalty and the victory of the Prophet Mohammed."" -- Bernama, the Malaysian national news agency, reported that thousands protested peacefully Friday against the film and cartoons in Kuala Lumpur. The U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur closed Friday morning before protests began. Khairy Jamaluddin, head of the youth wing of the Malaysian political party United Malays National Organization, said the United States and France should take immediate steps to punish those behind the film and cartoons, according to Bernama. -- In Indonesia, the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, its consular offices in Surabaya and Bali and two other facilities were closed Friday due to expected demonstrations. -- Germany also closed its embassy in Sudan's capital city of Khartoum on Friday in anticipation of protests over the cartoon published in Charlie Hebdo, state-run Ashorooq TV reported. Last week, protesters in Sudan's capital city managed to get inside a compound that is shared by the German and British diplomatic missions, according to the foreign ministers of both nations.","Pro-democracy protesters take over Islamist group's building in Benghazi, Libya .

"Swirling winds and heavy downpours probably did more than the massive Israeli police presence to dampen Palestinian protests in Jerusalem over the weekend. Dire predictions that a third intifada was about to erupt after the brief closure of the Temple Mount -- known to Arabs as the Noble Sanctuary -- came to nothing. But the weather could not sweep away the toxic atmosphere in the city. Tension in Jerusalem is perhaps at its greatest since the end of the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, ten years ago -- stoked by a rash of what some call hate crimes and others acts of terror. Regular -- almost daily -- outbreaks of stone-throwing by Palestinian teenagers are answered by tear gas and rubber bullets; hundreds of minors have already had their first taste of jail. The city's mayor, describing the violence as intolerable, has announced that surveillance balloons equipped with HD cameras will be deployed above troublesome neighborhoods to prevent disturbances. The Israeli cabinet is considering legislation that would introduce prison terms of up to 20 years for throwing stones. One of the most restive neighborhoods in Jerusalem is Silwan, a densely-packed area in the shadow of the Temple Mount, where there is little work, a heavy police presence and a growing colony of Jewish settlers, moving into properties bought from Palestinians. Touchstone issue . Last month, a Palestinian from Silwan drove his car into passengers getting off a tram in Jerusalem, killing a baby and injuring several others, including a woman who died later. And last week, a 32-year-old Palestinian shot and gravely wounded a right-wing rabbi, Yehuda Glick, as he left a Jerusalem conference called ""The Jewish people return to the Temple Mount."" Glick, now in a serious but stable condition in hospital, has long argued that the Jews must have a place of worship on the Temple Mount, a touchstone issue for Muslims who suspect a plan to expel them from the site, where the al Aqsa mosque is also situated. Glick's view is supported by some elected officials, including Housing Minister Uri Ariel and Deputy Speaker of the Knesset (and a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party) Moshe Feiglin. Glick's assailant, Mutaz Hijazi, who had spent more than a decade in prison, in part for crimes of violence, was shot dead by an Israeli counter-terror unit hours later. Hundreds of Palestinians attended Hijazi's funeral; his father said that if Hijazi had shot Glick it was because ""occupation equals resistance."" Israeli authorities reacted to the attempted assassination of Glick by closing the al Aqsa mosque altogether for one day, then restricting access to men over 50 years of age and women, and putting thousands more police on the streets. The Palestinian Authority described the closure -- the first in 14 years -- as a ""declaration of war."" There were also harsh words from Jordan, which remains the custodian of the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem according to its peace treaty with Israel. In such an environment acts of political violence can spark outsize responses and set off an uncontrollable chain of events. The killing of three Jewish teenagers in the West Bank back in May, which Israel said was the work of Hamas, sparked a crisis that ultimately led to the Gaza conflict. In July, the abduction and murder of a Palestinian teenager in Jerusalem provoked serious rioting. Three Israelis are on trial for the killing. Feiglin said ""the government's weakness and incompetence in handling terrorism"" were responsible for the attempt of Glick's life. Early on Sunday morning, with a police guard, Feiglin returned to the Temple Mount in defiance of an appeal from Netanyahu for Knesset members to show responsibility and restraint. 'Most sensitive kilometer on Earth' Netanyahu is walking a fine line between supporting the existing right of Jews to visit (but not pray at) the Temple Mount and preventing that right from sparking a broader crisis and renewed violence. In a statement Sunday aimed as much at the likes of Feiglin as Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, he said the Temple Mount complex is ""the most sensitive kilometer on Earth,"" and insisted the government would not change the status quo. ""It is easy to start a religious fire but much more difficult to extinguish it,"" Netanyahu said. On that note he and Abbas were in rare accord, the Palestinian President saying ""assaults and provocations by fanatics will lead to grave consequences."" Some commentators say Netanyahu is politically vulnerable on this issue. The Israeli right, and especially the Jewish Home Party led by Economy Minister Naftali Bennett, is growing in strength, according to opinion polls. Bennett -- a member of the Israeli cabinet -- argued for a tougher Gaza campaign aimed at destroying Hamas and is widely seen as Netanyahu's principal challenger. He told the Financial Times last month that ""the logic that the world will love us if we give up more land doesn't work"" and has pressed for more settlement construction. He also told CNN he supported the right of Jews to pray at the Temple Mount. By contrast, support for the centrist and leftist parties is dropping, while opposition to a two-state negotiated settlement is widespread. A poll this month for the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs found that 75% of the Israeli Jews oppose Israel's withdrawal from the Jordan Valley and the division of Jerusalem, which would give the eastern half to the Palestinians. The volatility in Jerusalem has become the latest flashpoint in Israeli-Palestinian relations. The peace process is moribund amid an absence of trust between the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority; much of Gaza is in ruins following seven weeks of conflict there this summer in which more than 2,000 people were killed. The European Union has questioned Israel's ""commitment to a peaceful negotiated settlement with the Palestinians"" in the wake of renewed momentum in expanding Jewish settlements in Arab East Jerusalem.  The U.S. State Department made a similar criticism. In such an atmosphere, it is hardly surprising that U.S. efforts to promote dialogue have stumbled. Writing in Foreign Policy, Stephen M. Walt says that if you invest real effort in the peace process -- as have President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry ""and you get precisely zero help from Netanyahu and his lieutenants, a degree of irritation is to be expected."" ""The United States wants a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a meaningful détente with Iran, the Netanyahu government opposes both,"" he added. The left-leaning Israeli newspaper Haaretz published a cartoon showing a grinning Netanyahu piloting an Israeli plane whizzing toward a U.S. skyscraper. Responding to a furious reaction in social media, cartoonist Amos Biderman said: ""The message is that Bibi is arrogantly and wantonly destroying Israel's ties with the U.S."" From the other end of the political spectrum, journalist Caroline Glick wrote: ""While [Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud] Abbas himself is responsible for the hit on [Yehuda] Glick, he has had one major enabler -- the Obama administration."" A Jerusalem Post poll at the weekend found that 53% of Israeli Jews now regarded the US administration as pro-Palestinian, with just 16% seeing it as pro-Israel. Responding to disparaging remarks made about him by unidentified U.S. officials last week, Netanyahu sought to turn the criticism to his advantage, saying ""the assault on me comes only because I defend the state of Israel."" But that doesn't include changing the delicate status quo on the Temple Mount and inviting yet more violence at the end of a year already full of bloodshed.","Tension in Jerusalem is perhaps at its greatest since the end of the last Palestinian uprising .

"From the beginning of 2015, Britain is embarking upon an experiment with driverless cars. Transport Minister Claire Perry has already labeled it ""transformational."" In Perry's perfect world it'll be the precursor to millions of driverless cars on our roads. For many, it has all the constituents of a recipe for disaster. And for the realists it's unlikely to happen in a major way for at least a couple of decades. According to Perry, driverless cars will help out harassed mums by taking on the school run. They'll give disabled people who currently can't drive the power of self-mobility. And best of all, they'll scythe into that irritating statistic that says 90% of road crashes are caused by human error. For many people, driverless cars are an alien concept. Car maker Volvo says 2012 data showed only half of 18-37 year-olds were ready for the driverless car revolution. That means half of this digitally-savvy age group weren't. Perry cites the technology as being the barrier for humans getting to grips with driverless cars. She's wrong. In 2014, more than two million new cars will be sold in the UK. A significant proportion will feature the cruise control, self-parking systems, autonomous emergency braking and lane departure warning that enable a car to be driverless. We're more than used to the technology. We understand computers are more than capable of reacting correctly to situations they've been programmed to deal with. But we also know our roads are an incredibly complex, constantly evolving and entirely unpredictable environment. Despite all our laws and rules, roads are random, like humans. Consequently we are brilliant at reading the situations we find ourselves in; accidents happen because we just don't react correctly. The result of this is that having driverless cars sharing the road with human-driven vehicles has chaos written all over it. And we're not just talking mayhem at street level. Multiple car makers agree that the technology is already fit for purpose. It's the legislation and logistics that need sorting out. To operate safely, self-driving cars need to talk to each other. They need to identify cars that are parked and therefore not a threat. If they're traveling in a convoy at motorway speed -- ""platooning"" as it's called -- Car A needs to tell Cars B and C to the side and behind that it wants to come off at the next junction. Then Car B needs to tell car D behind that it's slowing down to let Car A in and so on. The only way this can work is if they talk the same language. Some car makers are currently working on this but industry insiders say the specifics are unlikely to be agreed much before 2030. They haven't even agreed how much control the computers should take. Should they drive all the time? Or would humans retain some control? Once they have agreed that, drivers will need training. If you're buying a car that's going to hold your life in its computerized hands, the majority of responsible adults will want more than the 10-minute handover chat from a salesperson already preoccupied with how to spend their month-end bonus. And if the car then crashed because its human hadn't operated it properly, who would be liable? Does the owner's insurance cough up? Is it the manufacturer who sold you the car but didn't brief you properly? Or the third party who supplied the manufacturer with the technology? Again more questions. In an effort to answer some of these, the UK Government has set up a £10m ($16m) fund to look at how driverless cars can be integrated into everyday life in the UK. That sounds great, except £10m barely gets you off the driveway in car industry terms. A major manufacturer such as Ford will spend 100 times that just on marketing a new model. Let's assume the government does find some answers, will Mrs Smith really be able to trust her car to take Tarquin and Mungo to school? What happens if Mungo starts feeling sick? Or Tarquin's left his maths homework on the kitchen table? I'd hazard a computer will struggle with those little everyday challenges that we humans absorb so brilliantly. Perhaps more importantly, is just how much control we would cede. I would be happy to let a car do the driving in a slow-moving motorway traffic jam. I'm not sure about driverless cars in a congested urban environment. And I'm even less certain about having cars running around without a capable driver even in them. Perry is right: driverless cars could be transformational. But at the moment, there are too many questions to know if that's going to be in a good way.","The UK government has announced a £10 million fund to research driverless cars .

"What comes in a white cardboard box, weighs little more than a kilogram and can be purchased in a few clicks from Amazon? Few people would guess a drone -- a term that conjures up stealth strikes and spy movies. But that's the point for DJI, a Chinese company that dominates the young but growing market for personal and commercial drones. It wants to make the airborne gadgets, if not soft and cuddly, at least unremarkable. ""It's made of white plastic. It's not scary. It's pretty accessible to most people,"" says Eric Cheng, DJI's director of aerial imaging. The company's ready-to-fly Phantom photography drone makes it a ""global leader,"" in small unmanned aerial systems according to Frost & Sullivan, a research group. DJI believes drones like the Phantom will soon become another ""camera in your bag,"" allowing photography enthusiasts to embrace ""dronies"" with same fervor as ""selfies."" ""It's sort of an extension of the selfie stick really,"" says Cheng.  ""It's an unlocking of the third dimension for camera positioning."" Their latest four-propeller drone is equipped with a high-definition camera and a wi-fi transmitter lets pilots watch the video streamed live to their smartphone that attaches to the controller. Mounted on a three-axis gimbal or stabilizer, the camera can be rotated while the drone hovers in place enabling it to capture stunning aerial images such as close-ups of a volcano. Transition . The company was founded in 2006 by engineer and remote control helicopter enthusiast Frank Wang, who started out making kits for hobbyists before launching the Phantom range in 2013. It has expanded quickly, growing from 20 employees in 2009 to 2,500, who are mainly based at company headquarters in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen. Operating at the cutting edge of a new technology is rare for Chinese companies, which are typically regarded as manufacturers of ideas and designs hatched in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. It's the kind of company that China needs more of if it wants to make the transition from world's factory floor to a home for innovative companies with global reach. Cheng says Shenzhen marries the best of China's manufacturing prowess with a rich pool of design and engineering talent. ""You don't have to wait eight days for a prototype to come back in."" Confusing regulation? Its early lead puts it at the heart of the debate over regulation of the drone industry, which has been dogged by red tape, privacy concerns and a poor reputation. Many fear drones landing in backyards and peering in windows. Cheng says the policy environment is confusing for most users. In the U.S., amateur drone users can't go above 400 feet (120 meters), and the devices can only be used by hobbyists. The Federal Aviation Administration is working on clearing commercial unmanned aerial vehicles and details are expected by the end of the year. Other jurisdictions such as Australia and New Zealand allow wider use, says Cheng, and the company's drones are used in fields ranging from mining and agriculture, to nature conservancy and real estate. As drones catch on in the mainstream, the company has built in features to help first-time pilots. The device is programmed to avoid airports and automatically returns to a home point if it flies out of range. ""Most people are successful with the product and consider it easy to fly,"" says Cheng.  ""That said, it's still a flying machine so it has the potential to hit things and crash."" Just don't call it a drone . In an hour-long interview, Cheng only uses the word ""drone"" when pressed and says the industry is struggling with the terminology. But with ""I want a drone"" now reportedly one of the top recurring search terms based on Google autofill data and the word widespread in the media, the company says it's now focused on changing what drone means to people and regulators. ""It's really heartening -- once people use them, it's not a struggle to get them to think of the drone as a generic thing rather than (something) scary.""","DJI wants to make aerial photography drones mainstream .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton's lead over Sen. Barack Obama, her chief rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, is growing among African-American voters who are registered Democrats, and particularly among black women, a poll said Wednesday. Sen. Hillary Clinton is the top choice of African-American Democrats, a new poll suggests. Among black registered Democrats overall, Clinton had a 57 percent to 33 percent lead over Obama. That's up from 53 percent for Clinton and 36 percent for Obama in a poll carried out in April. The 26-point difference between black women and men underscores the fact that the nation's vote is divided not only by race, but also by gender, said CNN political analyst Bill Schneider. ""Black women don't just vote their black identity,"" he said. ""They also vote their identity as women."" Among white registered Democrats, Clinton drew 49 percent support, versus 18 percent for Obama and 17 percent for former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, the latest poll found. The question had a sampling error of plus-or-minus 6.5 percentage points. The former first lady's strongest support among blacks came from black women, 68 percent of whom identified her as their likely choice, versus 25 percent who cited Obama, the senator from Illinois who is African-American.  Watch Bill Schneider examine CNN poll results on black political support » . Black men who are registered Democrats were nearly evenly split, with 42 percent favoring Clinton and 46 percent favoring Obama. The sampling error of that question was plus-or-minus 8 percentage points. Black registered Democrats also appeared more sure of themselves than did whites, with two-thirds (67 percent) of blacks saying they would definitely support whichever candidate they had said they favored, versus one-third (33 percent) who said they might change their minds. White registered Democrats appeared more open to persuasion, with only 45 percent saying they would definitely support that person, and 54 percent saying they might change their minds. Overall, registered white voters polled appeared nearly evenly split between the two major parties, with 45 percent saying they would definitely or probably vote for the Democratic presidential candidate, and 47 percent saying the same about the Republican presidential candidate. That question had a sampling error of plus-or-minus 6 percentage points. But black voters appeared overwhelmingly likely to vote Democratic, with 80 percent of them saying they were definitely or probably going to cast their vote for the party's candidate. Just 13 percent of blacks said the same thing about the Republican candidate. Clinton maintained an overwhelming lead among black registered voters when pitted against former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, besting the leading GOP presidential candidate 86 percent to 13 percent. But when the same question was asked of white registered voters, the senator from New York's lead vanished, with Giuliani outpolling her 57 percent to 40 percent. That question had a sampling error of plus-or-minus 6 percentage points. The questions were asked based on the absence of former Vice President Al Gore from the race. He has repeatedly said he has no plans to run. But, were he to change his mind, and if he won the Democratic nomination, the poll found that 52 percent of 927 registered voters queried said they would choose him versus 46 percent who cited Giuliani. Among blacks, that lead was 78 percent for Gore versus 20 percent for Giuliani. In response to poll results showing him trailing Clinton, Obama has noted that Clinton has been a major figure in national politics for 15 years, versus just three for Obama. ""The 'sistah' vote is paying off handsomely for Hillary Clinton,"" said Democratic political strategist Donna Brazile. ""It's not only getting her the women's vote. It's also getting her the black vote."" A gender gap also exists among white Democrats, but -- at 11 points -- it is narrower. The CNN/Opinion Research Poll of 1,212 adult Americans was carried out by telephone Friday through Sunday. The sample included interviews of 307 blacks and 762 non-Latino whites.

"(CNN)Late on Friday night, the Sierra Leone-registered Ezadeen was towed into the port of Corigliano Calabro in southern Italy. Normally a livestock carrier, the vessel had just under 400 people on board, including more than 70 children. Most were from Syria, desperate to reach Europe -- whatever the cost and risk. For the second time in days a merchant ship had been abandoned by its crew in atrocious weather in the Ionian Sea between Greece and Italy, its human cargo left helpless in storm force gales. The message from the Ezadeen was simple and helpless: ""There is no one to steer."" The Moldovan-flagged Blue Sky M was abandoned by most of its crew three days earlier. One of the migrants on board had been able to raise the alarm, but initially a Greek frigate in the area reported nothing amiss on board. Some 800 people were crammed into the hull of Blue Sky M. In both cases, it was the Italian coast guard that eventually boarded and steered the ships to safety. Maurizio Albahari, an anthropologist from the Italian port of Gallipoli (where the Blue Sky M docked), says it's not the first time that larger cargo ships have been involved in  illicit journeys at this time of year, with the smugglers hoping there will be fewer maritime patrols over the Christmas period. But the tactic of setting vessels on autopilot and then abandoning them is rare. Albahari, an assistant professor at the University of Notre Dame in the United States, says these larger vessels are often ""mother ships"" that discharge the migrants onto smaller boats. But the heavy sea conditions suggest the Ezadeen and Blue Sky M -- both old ships -- were sacrificed for one last payday. People desperate to escape war, persecution . Ships carrying the migrants are frequently barely seaworthy -- flying under flags of convenience, sometimes with forged certificates. They are the workhorses of the Mediterranean, changing names and owners frequently, carrying cargoes like salt until sent on one last desperate voyage. Some have lost their safety certificate. The 73-meter (240-foot) Ezadeen was built in 1966, according to shipping records. These ships carry some desperate to escape war or persecution, who would typically be classified as refugees. The majority are trying to escape poverty or hunger -- illegal migrants. The distinction is often not easy to make. But with the conflict in Syria in its fourth year, and the collapse of Libya, the flow of desperate people heading north is growing exponentially. European officials say the port of Mersin in southern Turkey, which is still connected by ferry to Latakia in Syria, is often a starting point for the journey, and the ships will sometimes travel via Cyprus. The Blue Sky M appears to have called at the Syrian port of Latakia last month; the Ezadeen at nearby Tartus in October. There is always money to be made out of misery. Their routes can be difficult to trace; these vessels often sail with their Automatic Identification System disabled, making them electronically invisible. Albahari says officials at smaller ports in Turkey, Egypt and Albania sometimes turn a blind eye to the human trafficking, which can be disguised by bringing migrants on board in small batches. In Libya, the absence of any state authority allows Tunisian fishing boats to take part in the illicit traffic. Local militia in Libya control and profit from two migrant routes through the Sahara. In the east, Somalis, Eritreans and Sudanese come through al Kufrah; west Africans pass through Sabah. The ""passengers"" -- frequently without water, food or warmth -- pay anywhere between $5,000 and $9,000 a person for the crossing. So a single shipment might be worth $1 million. But most are prepared to pay the premium rather than risk trying to take the cheaper route from Libya, where African migrants endure far worse conditions. Figures from the European Union's border agency, Frontex, show that 270,000 people tried to enter Europe illegally in 2014 -- with huge increases in the numbers setting off across the central and eastern Mediterranean. According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 3,000 died in the attempt in 2014. Pope: Don't let sea ""become a vast cemetery"" For 15 months cash-strapped Italy ran a program called Mare Nostrum, which rescued thousands of would-be refugees and migrants in the Mediterranean. The Italian navy converted the San Giorgio into a rescue ship equipped with an infirmary, jail cells for smugglers and even quarantine sections for those with infectious diseases. But Mare Nostrum cost some $12 million a month and critics said it encouraged migrants to try to reach Europe. ""Traffickers have taken advantage of the situation by placing more vulnerable people in unseaworthy boats on the basis that they will be rescued and taken to Italy,"" the UK Immigration Minister James Brokenshire told Parliament last year. Britain refused to contribute to Frontex's Operation Triton, which replaced Mare Nostrum in November and has already rescued some 11,400 migrants. Even a patrol boat from Iceland has been involved: the Tyr was the first alongside the Ezadeen late Thursday. The Tyr also helped bring more than 400 migrants to a port in Sicily last month after rescuing them from ships that had set sail from Turkey. By its own admission the Frontex operation is limited, with patrols staying largely within 30 nautical miles of the European shore. Its budget is less than one-third of Mare Nostrum, and it has just two planes and a helicopter, and about seven patrol vessels. Human rights groups say the new approach amounts to ""Let them drown."" The ""autopilot"" tactic seen in the last week may be a reaction by smugglers to this new policy, as there is less chance of migrants being found farther out to sea. The incoming head of the European Commission, Jean Claude Junker, has promised to reinforce Frontex. But across the EU, support is rising for stronger action against would-be migrants. There is little sympathy for an expensive Europe-wide version of Mare Nostrum to pluck thousands of people from the Mediterranean. In November, Pope Francis made an impassioned plea for Europe to recognize the ""human dignity of immigrants."" ""We cannot allow the Mediterranean to become a vast cemetery,"" he told the European Parliament. But with several countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean highly unstable, smugglers will be hoping to make much more money in 2015. And hundreds of their customers are likely to perish in the process.","The flow of migrants has increased significantly .

"November 2014 may well be remembered as the time when humanity first landed a robotic probe on the nucleus of a comet. Fittingly, the mission that accomplished this remarkable feat is called ""Rosetta."" In 1799, French soldiers discovered an ancient Egyptian tablet, inscribed in 196 BC with writing in three different languages. Ultimately, this script on the Rosetta Stone, in combination with writing on an obelisk on the Nile River island of Philae, helped to unlock understanding of Egyptian hieroglyphs. This writing told of a far more ancient Egypt. Similarly, the modern-day creators of the Rosetta mission hope its exploration will unlock comets -- ancient nuclei of rock and ices that are keys to understanding the formation of our solar system. Scientists also hope the mission will provide an insight into Earth's earliest years. Comets bombarded the young Earth. Did they bring with them much of the water that still exists on our home planet, as well as the organic molecules that life needed in order to arise on Earth? November 2014 is significant for another reason -- the SETI Institute will celebrate its 30th birthday on November 20. Why is this relevant to the Rosetta mission? The SETI Institute's mission is to explore, understand, and explain the origin and nature of life in the universe. In many ways, the SETI Institute's goal is the same as Rosetta's -- but on a much larger stage. The word ""life"" for a researcher at the SETI Institute can be anything from a single-celled organism to a technological life form far more advanced than humans. It is the latter life form -- extraterrestrial intelligence -- that people typically associate with the SETI Institute. And the search for such intelligence stands in remarkable parallel to the spirit of Rosetta. Just as the discovery and study of the Rosetta Stone aided understanding of ancient Egypt, the detection and study of evidence from another technological civilization would place our own in a universal context. It could even give us a look into the future of our own species. Daily news reports tell of potential disaster that could befall civilization, be it in the form of global warming, a rapidly mutating virus, or an impact by a cousin of the very object that Philae will land on. Finding concrete evidence that technological societies have survived long-term elsewhere would be reassuring, even inspirational. While searches for signs of intelligent life have been ongoing for more than three decades with no detection, we have barely scratched the surface of such a quest. There are several hundred billion stars in our galaxy, and a similar number of galaxies in the known universe, all containing their own billions of stars. Recent results from the Kepler mission have shown that between 10 and 20%  of our neighborhood's stars have planets that could be habitable. To date, our searches for the intelligent life that might have grown up around those stars amounts to one scoop of sand compared to all of the sand on all of the beaches in the world. Be not discouraged by lack of detection to date. We must dig deeper and more thoroughly. However, the SETI Institute researchers search for more than just the endgame intelligent life. They also work to fill in all gaps in the story of life, its origins, and its evolution. While the discovery of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe is similar to the end of a well-written novel, appreciation of that ending is greatly enhanced when you read the other chapters in the book. To write those chapters, SETI researchers study extremophile life forms on this planet -- organisms that live beneath ice-covered lakes in Antarctica, inside the hot springs of Yellowstone in the United States, and in the high-elevation deserts of Chile. These studies inform us about whether life likely arose on other, less hospitable planets, how to recognize that life, and how life here has evolved. Institute scientists also investigate whether strange life may inhabit other nearby worlds. Imagine finding biology on Saturn's moon Titan, with its lakes of methane. Such life would indeed be very different from what we're used to. Its discovery would throw open the window of possibilities for biological beings elsewhere. How often does life make the leap from microbe to intelligence? Evidence now indicates that the basic building block of intelligence emerged on this planet some billion years ago, with increasingly intelligent life being present in the intervening years. Institute researchers study how non-human intelligent life on Earth communicates, hoping to grasp the fundamental elements of communication -- those we might find in the ""languages"" of extraterrestrial communicators -- both within and across species. We are just beginning to understand and appreciate the levels and variety of intelligence that exist on this planet, and the myriad ways that other animals can and do communicate. Institute scientists play a key role in these fields, seeking both to understand the evolution of Earthly intelligence and to grasp the daunting complexity of how we might recognize and understand a message from beyond our planet. However, public funding for science education programs, while steady in magnitude, is inadequate for the task. Government funding of space exploration is also in jeopardy. But it's these things -- engaging science teachers, iconic images of manned space missions on TV -- that inspire young people to thirst for knowledge of the universe around us, and to enter into scientific fields of research and study. As such, one of our main missions at the SETI Institute is to help educate the public and to instil a vigor for knowledge and exploration in the youth. Inspiring the next generation of scientific thinkers and explorers is paramount to our mission and our work. I believe that not only will the Rosetta mission help us understand where we come from and what our history is, but also help in inspiring a new generation to follow in the footsteps of Carl Sagan and Frank Drake. As we all celebrate the success of the Rosetta mission, those of us at the SETI Institute will continue into the fourth decade of the Institute's existence in pursuit of our mission -- understanding the origin of life on this planet and finding evidence of it on other worlds. As we continue our quest into the future, I hope you will join us at SETI .","Rosetta scientists hope mission will unlock comets' secrets .

"When a mainland Chinese tourist heard about a bookstore in Hong Kong that sold books banned by Beijing, he knew he had to check it out. The Beijing native traveled to Hong Kong for a weekend in July and stopped by People's Commune in Causeway Bay to see if the rumors were true. ""I want to know the inside stories of the party,"" said the man, who did not want to be identified because it was illegal to bring the books back home. ""It has nothing to do with me personally but there is no way you can get those inside China."" In mainland China the government places strict controls on mass media, which often means that political analysis and controversial accounts of Chinese history are impossible to find within the country's borders. However, entrepreneurs in Hong Kong -- a special administrative region of China that has freedom of press -- are cashing in on the ban to cater to the millions of mainland Chinese who travel to Hong Kong to shop. Bookstores such as People's Commune stock their shelves with forbidden tales of everything from the Tiananmen Square crackdown of 1989 to the ongoing scandal of ousted Communist Party official Bo Xilai. Deng Zi Qiang, the owner of People's Commune, has seen a growing flood of mainland Chinese customers since he opened the store in 2003, the same year Hong Kong was opened to an increasing number of independent travelers from China. In 2011, Hong Kong had 28.1 million visitors from the mainland, compared to 13.6 million in 2006, according to statistics from the Hong Kong Tourism Board. Now, ""95% of the customers are from mainland China,"" said Deng, a Hong Kong native. The People's Commune has opened an account on China's microblogging site Sina Weibo to inform their Chinese customers of new selections and to take orders. Most buyers are from developed cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, Deng said. They range in age from 30 to 40 years old and are scholars or businessmen. Even Chinese government officials and police chiefs have come through his doors. ""Some of them show me their police IDs when checking out"" to prove they are government officials, Deng said. As a businessman, Deng said he doesn't care too much about political rumors and scandal, but his book selection taps a huge potential market. ""Mainland China is short of information and freedom of expression compared to Hong Kong,"" Deng said. ""Besides luxury goods, I thought it could also be an attraction for mainland Chinese."" He said that he sells between 200 and 300 books a month. Zhou Baosong, a political professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said part of the allure for mainland Chinese is that reading such books makes people feel like they are political participants, rather than just helpless observers. That also explains why many Hong Kong locals don't pay much attention to the bookstores. In democratic societies like Hong Kong people don't exhibit the same passion for reading political books since they have adequate ways to get information and be involved in politics, Zhou said. But this information climate also provides lots of room for rumors and falsehoods. ""Mainland Chinese are more keen to read (whatever they can),"" said Zhou. ""Rumors then get the opportunity to spread."" On a recent Friday night dozens of customers sat in the store browsing selections at People's Commune. ""I found some books ridiculous,"" said a stock broker from Fujian Province, in Eastern China, who stopped in the bookstore while his wife and daughter shopped nearby. ""I think our country is the best place to be."" When returning to China, his customers risk having them confiscated at customs, Deng said. Still, many make repeated trips to obtain the books, he added. But it's not a defiance of the Communist Party that fuels his desire to read these books, said the customer from Beijing. ""Just because I'm reading these books, doesn't mean I'm anti-Party,"" he said. ""In fact, if the people have more access to the decision-making process they can give suggestions and provide their wisdom. ""As long as it doesn't hurt the fundamental well being of its people, I don't see a reason for the country to ban the information,"" adds the man, who left with several political magazines in tow. ""After all, we want the country to be better and our lives to be improved.""","Bookstores in Hong Kong are now catering to mainland Chinese tourists .

"Prisons in developing countries can usually be characterized as hazardous and chaotic places for offenders. Due to limited resources, the prisons are left to be run by ruthless gangs. In the Pedrinhas prison in northern Brazil, the decapitation of inmates by a rival gang highlights ""the lawlessness"" within Brazil's correctional system. Prisons in the Philippines bear many similarities. However, the Philippine prison system is about to go through reformation following last year's passing of the Modernization Act by the Philippine Congress. Plans include the building of a new super-max facility to replace New Bilibid Prison (NBP) to reduce congestion and eliminate gangs within the system. But is this the right path? From over four years of ethnographic research we have conducted in NBP, we don't think so. Gangs dominate prison . NBP, on the outskirts of Manila, is one of the world's largest maximum-security facilities. Recent statistics we have collected from the Bureau of Corrections, which administers NBP, has the inmate population to be now exceeding 14,200. With space for only 5,500, this makes the congestion rate around 260 per cent. Around 95% of inmates belong to 12 gangs that share control of the prison. In these overcrowded conditions, corruption is endemic and contraband, such as drugs and high-calibre weapons, is readily available. Over the past three years, prison raids have uncovered automatic machine pistols and other lethal weapons held by gangs. Two M-16 hand grenades have also been thrown during gang disputes. We have observed how easy it is for inmates to acquire mobile phones. The telephones facilitate criminal activity on the outside to be freely run from the inside. From all this, one can easily conclude that, like Pedrinhas prison, NBP is dysfunctional. However, from participant observation studies and over 100 informal interviews with gang leaders, inmates and prison officials, we have developed an alternative perspective on prison gangs. Why gangs are important . While there is no doubt that gangs are responsible for much of the criminality inside, we found that the gang system (or Pangkat) is not exclusively about crime. In fact, many inmates are kept busy with legitimate activities and ""do their time"" productively. Since their inception in the late 1940s, NBP's gangs have come to form a crucial part of inmate management and welfare. Much of the negative publicity about NBP only captures a small part of the reality inside. There are, in fact, many positive aspects of gang life in the seemingly chaotic conditions that are often overlooked yet crucial for inmate survival. When prisons become overcrowded and the inmate-to-staff ratio exceeds safe levels (that is, 4:1), the essential task of maintaining order and ensuring the safety and welfare of inmates becomes complex and problematic. To carry out these critical tasks, prison administrators are forced to not only compromise organizational integrity, but also relinquish aspects of their management function to inmate leaders. In NBP, with an inmate to guard ratio of around 80:1, it has become unofficial practice to operate under a system of shared governance. By default and not by design, gang leaders help maintain internal control and safeguard inmates as best they can. Even though prison stability is fragile, gang leaders help prison guards restore stability once disorder occurs. But prison gangs are not all about maintaining order. They also provide inmates with a network of social support, access to material benefits and a source of income. Without these, survival becomes difficult for many. 'Sense of community' Gangs also develop their own rehabilitation and educational initiatives, which are separate to the more resource-constrained programs offered by prison administrators. In another important feature, gangs provide a substitute family for those who have lost contact with outside relatives. Fellow gang mates become brothers and the inmate leaders their fathers (or big brothers). Inmates have told us that it is common for them to call their leaders as ""tatay"" (father) or ""kuya"" (older brother), a Filipino cultural dynamic that orders the social standing of inmates. Additionally, inmates are sometimes called ""tatay"" or ""kuya""; a recognition of their respectability and an early indication of their leadership potential. A gang leader stated to us that, as a general rule, those who are industrious, cunning and can produce the most resources are usually elected leaders. Inmate leaders also help manage the prison cell blocks, which is akin to running a mini-city with its own micro-economy. Like a city, leaders are elected, generate income and manage resources to meet the needs of their constituents. They also respond to emergencies and diffuse conflicts. They take responsibility for offenders with special needs by controlling violent offenders, caring for the sick and disabled and even monitoring terrorist inmates. To ensure they remain in office, leaders also host sporting activities and entertainment programs like rock concerts and TV shows. To the casual observer, NBP may seem more like a self-sustaining community than a high-risk volatile correctional institution. The lanes that criss-cross the prison are crowded with inmates working, cooking or playing sport. On most days, inmates with families roam the grounds. It is also common to see children playing or looking at animals in the small zoo. It is evident that one of the most beneficial features of this set-up is the inmates' sense of community. Even though one is inside a prison, the outside environment is being mirrored here. Evolution of prison life . In modern sophisticated open prisons like those in Scandinavia, correctional officials have found that progression through a sentence should be aimed as much as possible at returning inmates to the community. They assert that ""the more closed a system is, the harder it will be to return to freedom."" Thousands of miles away, we can see that, left to evolve almost by accident, NBP has progressed towards a similar model. While NBP was originally built as a closed, American style high-security facility, over time, the walls have become porous, security has lapsed and deals have been made with inmate leaders to ensure prison order. Consequently, compromises have been made to allow more inmate autonomy. Even mobile telephones, formally considered contraband, are unofficially accepted by prison administration and considered important for rehabilitation as they keep inmates in contact with family. As in Scandinavian prisons, NBP administrators have come to realize that regular family communication helps ""sustain emotional ties,"" as well as giving inmates outside avenues to vent and heal. Much of the existing knowledge on prison social systems is gained from settings where facilities are adequately provided, staff numbers are sufficient and properly trained and operational resources are allocated to ensure prisons run smoothly. In these settings, it is common practice to try to eliminate gangs due to their inherent problems. As such, the popular perception about prison gangs has generally been incomplete. Despite its many drawbacks, the gang system in NBP aids adjustment and survival by lessening the ""pains of imprisonment."" It also provides inmates with mechanisms to preserve self-identity and self-respect, which, in turn, equips them to re-integrate into the outside community upon release. Time will tell how the new reformation plans will impact on inmates. If they implement an American model of mass incarceration and eliminate gangs, without dedicating sufficient resources to replace the support structures they provide, prison reform in the Philippines is bound to fail. A better solution would be to continue with a more open prison model, formalize the social structure, target corruption, and, over time, reduce inmate dependency on illicit activities.","New Bilibid Prison in the Philippines has around 14,200 inmates, more than twice its capacity .

"The woman who filed a harassment lawsuit against Paula Deen said Monday her suit ""has never been about the N-word,"" addressing the slur that has tarnished the celebrity chef's image and cost her endorsements, a book deal and her TV show. The statement from Lisa Jackson was the first since the scandal began last month, when Deen's deposition in Jackson's suit was made public. In the deposition, Deen acknowledges using the racial slur more than once ""a very long time"" ago. In tearful interview, Deen slams 'horrible lies' ""This lawsuit has never been about the N-word,"" Jackson says in the statement, provided to CNN's Don Lemon by her lawyer, Matthew Billips. ""It is to address Ms. Deen's patterns of disrespect and degradation of people that she deems to be inferior. Opinion: We use Paula Deen to give ourselves a pass . ""I may be a white woman, but I could no longer tolerate her abuse of power as a business owner, nor her condonation of Mr. Hier's despicable behavior on a day-to-day basis. I am what I am, and I am a human being that cares about all races, and that is why I feel it is important to be the voice for those who are too afraid to use theirs."" Jackson is a former manager at Deen's restaurants in Savannah, Georgia. She is suing Deen and her brother, Bubba Hier, alleging they committed numerous acts of violence, discrimination and racism that resulted in the end of her five-year employment at Deen's Lady & Sons and Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House eateries in Savannah. Opinion: Can we forgive Deen? Deen's lawyer has called the allegations false, and Deen has said she does not tolerate prejudice. The chef, famous for her smiling demeanor and love of butter, has made tearful apologies that have failed to suppress the controversy. Since the scandal began, she has lost at least nine endorsements, her Food Network cooking show, and publication of her eagerly anticipated cookbook has been canceled.

"The suicide of a 14-year-old girl who was apparently targeted by online ""trolls"" has added fuel to calls in Britain for action to prevent abuse on social media, following outrage over rape and bomb threats made against women via Twitter. Teenager Hannah Smith was found dead Friday at her home in Leicestershire. She hanged herself after she was bullied on the website Ask.fm, her father told UK media, having gone there to look for advice on the skin condition eczema. And the nightmare is not over for her family. Her older sister, Jo, is quoted in the Daily Mirror newspaper Wednesday as saying that she is now herself the target of Internet trolls. ""I've just lost my sister and now I've got to deal with getting abuse myself,"" she told the newspaper. ""These trolls don't care what happened to Hannah or what we're going through, they just live in their sad little worlds. It's really upsetting. I'm struggling to cope with what's happened and don't need these trolls hounding me."" Nasty comments were also posted on a Facebook memorial page set up in Hannah's memory. More than 10,000 people have signed an online petition calling on the government to act after Hannah's death. It states, ""Cyber-Bullying has been an ever increasing problem within the UK for a considerable amount of time with one of the biggest offenders becoming Ask.fm, a site popular amongst young people where posts can be made with confidence anonymously which has led to bullying, mental health problems and suicides as well as grooming."" Ask.fm, a social networking and question-and-answer site, said the teenager's death was a ""true tragedy."" ""We would like to convey our deepest condolences to her family and friends. We have reached out to the Leicestershire police and would be happy to cooperate with their investigation in to the true circumstances of her suicide,"" it said in a statement. ""Ask.fm actively encourages our users and their parents to report any incidences of bullying, either by using the in-site reporting button, or via our contact page.  All reports are read by our team of moderators to ensure that genuine concerns are heard and acted upon immediately -- and we always remove content reported to us that violates our Terms of Service."" Advice issued by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, run by police, warns that Ask.fm is not suitable for children and offers limited privacy. ""More often than not the anonymous nature of Ask.fm leads to exchanges of hate speech and cyberbullying. As such we would not recommend it as an appropriate online environment for children whether they are over 13 or not,"" it states. It adds that users can block people who post offensive comments and can also disable their own account if they choose. A spokeswoman for Leicestershire police said the teenager's death was subject to a coroner's inquest, so police could not yet investigate. An inquest is held in Britain when a death is sudden or unexplained. Arrests made over threats . Police are already investigating the online rape threats made against feminist Caroline Criado-Perez and Labour Party politician Stella Creasy, as well as bomb threats directed at several women journalists. London's Metropolitan Police said Wednesday that a 32-year-old man had been arrested in Bristol, southwest England, as part of an ongoing investigation into allegations relating to the reported rape threats. Two men were also arrested last week in connection with the inquiry. Andy Trotter of the Association of Chief Police Officers said police will act when threats are made, but they can't respond to all offensive comments posted. ""Reports of credible threats and communications made over social media that specifically target an individual and constitute harassment will be taken very seriously by the police and investigated,"" he said. But, he added, ""There are many grossly offensive, indecent and obscene comments made every day on social media that will not meet the threshold and where the police should not be involved. ... We would like to see social networks do more to take actions such as instantly suspend accounts where it might be appropriate."" Amid growing public anger over the threats made against women, Twitter announced Saturday that it had revised its rules on abusive behavior and was introducing an ""in-tweet"" button to report abuse.","Sister of a girl who committed suicide after she was bullied online says abuse continues .

"A 17-year-old Texas student who spent 52 days in a medically induced coma after police used a Taser on him at school entered a full-time rehabilitation facility Friday, his family's attorney said. Noe Nino de Rivera was transported to the hospital on November 20 after Bastrop County Sheriff's Deputy Randy McMillan, serving as a school resource officer, used the device on him after the teen tried to defuse a school fight involving two girls, one of them his girlfriend, said attorney Adam Loewy. The parents have filed a lawsuit alleging their son never posed a threat to the deputy and that Nino de Rivera suffered a permanent brain injury when he hit the ground after McMillan tased the teen. The family is also asking the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement to outlaw the devices, along with pepper spray, on state campuses. Several civil liberties groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, sent a letter to the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement last month calling the use of such weapons on children ""unconscionable."" ""Texas families deserve to send their children to school without fear, knowing they can trust their schools to be safe havens,"" the letter said. A jumpy surveillance video provided by Loewy shows Nino de Rivera amid a commotion in the hallway of Cedar Creek High School, about 20 miles southeast of Austin. The teen appears to be stepping backward, away from the officer, when he is hit with the stun gun and falls to the floor. ""As a result of being tased, NDR fell to the ground, striking his head on the floor. While NDR was unconscious, defendant McMillan placed him in handcuffs,"" the family's lawsuit says. School officials did not immediately call paramedics, the lawsuit says. When they did, Nino de Rivera was taken to a local hospital and later airlifted to St. David's Medical Center in nearby Austin, where he ""underwent surgery to repair a severe brain hemorrhage and was placed in a medically induced coma,"" court documents say. The lawsuit claims McMillan used excessive force and that Nino de Rivera ""posed no imminent threat of death or serious injury to McMIllan."" It asks for compensatory damages and attorney's fees and expert's fees, among other relief. Cynthia Ramirez of the Bastrop County Sheriff's Office said the department could not comment because of the pending litigation, but a court document from the county's attorneys alleged that Nino de Rivera ""failed to comply with the lawful orders of Deputy McMillan and therefore Deputy McMillan used the reasonable amount of necessary force to maintain and control discipline at the school."" ""The actions of Deputy McMillan were the actions of a reasonable officer,"" the court documents say. Kevin Lawrence, executive director of the Texas Municipal Police Association, defended McMillan's use of a Taser in an interview with CNN affiliate KXAN, saying Nino de Rivera appeared coherent after the incident and apologized to the officers. ""He was saying 'I shouldn't have done that,' "" Lawrence said. ""When they got him to the hospital, he again got out of control and became aggressive to hospital personnel to the point they called the sheriff's office again and said, 'We need help over here.' "" Loewy called Lawrence's account ""100% false"" and ""complete nonsense."" The lawyer further noted that doctors at St. David's Emergency Center-Bastrop quickly sedated the teen before having him airlifted to the Austin hospital. ""The video speaks for itself. (Nino de Rivera) was not acting aggressively,"" the attorney said. ""The deputies were very aggressive in coming up to this situation. I think this officer made up his mind to go to Taser very quickly."" ""He never struck the police officer. He never disobeyed instructions,"" Loewy added. Deborah Fowler, legal director for Texas Appleseed, a group that fights for social and economic justice in Texas -- and a signatory to the ACLU letter calling for a Taser ban in schools -- said there is no state or national data on how frequently Tasers are deployed on students. The letter to the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement cites more than a dozen media reports on officers who used Tasers or pepper spray on students, and Fowler cited high-profile cases in Wake County, North Carolina, and Syracuse, New York, but said she suspects such media reports are ""just the tip of the iceberg."" Texas Appleseed would be open to discussing with law enforcement how best to use the devices when a student has a gun or other weapon, she said, ""but that's not how it's being used, for the most part."" The Texas juvenile justice system doesn't allow Tasers, and it has specific limitations on when to use pepper spray, so Fowler said she doesn't understand how the state can condone the use of such devices in places of learning. ""There are other methods of de-escalating fights that wouldn't pose the same risk,"" she said. Family wants answers in Florida teen's death after Tasering .

"Clearly something is broken when a Missouri man named Jeff Mizanskey can be sentenced to die in prison for purchasing seven pounds of marijuana. With two nonviolent marijuana convictions already on his record, Jeff received life without parole under Missouri's three strikes law. The punishment of growing old and dying behind bars for offenses like Mizanskey's is extreme, tragic, and inhumane. This should outrage us, but it should not surprise us. This country has spent 40 years relentlessly ratcheting up the number of people going to prison and dramatically expanding the time we hold them there. We've spent decades criminalizing people with drug dependency, passing extreme sentencing laws, and waging a war on drugs that has not diminished drug use. Small wonder, then, that even less serious crimes like Mizanskey's marijuana purchase result in costly and cruel sentences. And Mizanskey is hardly the only one. Just as he fell into the abyss of our nation's failed drug policies and excessive sentencing laws, millions more have sat in jails and prisons, often for years, even decades on end, for low-level drug and property offenses. While many of the lawmakers who passed harsh sentencing laws thought they were doing the right thing, the results are now in: This approach has devastated families and communities, generated high recidivism rates, drained state budgets from more productive investments, and has reinforced generations of poverty and disadvantage that disproportionately fall on communities of color. There were ways to hold Mizanskey and others like him accountable for their actions short of sentencing them to die in prison. We can and must do better. It's time for states to end the costly criminalization of marijuana and recalibrate sentencing laws so that the punishment actually fits the crime as opposed to a politician's reelection agenda. Public attitudes toward marijuana are rapidly evolving, and a Gallup poll last year found for the first time that a majority of Americans now favor legalization as a better course than criminalization. Unfortunately, laws and police practices that enforce them are out of step with public opinion. Nationally, nearly half of all drug arrests are for marijuana offenses. At least one person is arrested for marijuana possession every hour in Mizanskey's home state of Missouri, which also wasted nearly $50 million on marijuana enforcement in 2010. Although black people and white people use marijuana at about the same rate, a black person in Missouri was 2.6 times more likely to be arrested for having marijuana than a white person. The solution is clear. Instead of taxpayers spending millions of dollars on this unnecessary enforcement and keeping folks like Mizanskey in prison for the rest of their lives, states could follow Colorado and Washington by taxing and regulating marijuana and investing saved enforcement dollars in education, substance abuse treatment, and prevention and other health care. But even if states are not ready to expand their tax base in this manner, state lawmakers need to take a good, hard look at their sentencing laws and eliminate penalties that far outweigh the crimes they seek to punish. It is tempting to think that Mizanskey's case is an anomaly, but that is not the case. According to a report released by the American Civil Liberties Union last year, there are currently 3,278 people serving life sentences without parole for nonviolent crimes, including marijuana offenses. Many of them, like Mizanskey, are there because of three-strikes laws and mandatory sentencing regimes. These policies force judges to impose excessively cruel sentences and forbid corrections officials from granting early release or parole, even despite exemplary records in prison. The good news is that there is a growing bipartisan consensus all over the country that our criminal justice system has gone too far and that we can and must safely downsize our prison population. Missouri recently reformed the three strikes law that sentenced Jeff to prison for life. If he were sentenced today, he could have received a significantly shorter sentence and be eligible for parole. As states like Missouri make these kinds of reforms, we must not forget the people who languish behind bars because of old sentencing laws now thought to be excessive. Smart reforms that correct past injustice should be made retroactive, and governors must use their clemency powers more frequently. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon should grant clemency to Jeff Mizanskey. Public safety is not served by having him die in prison. We're not stuck with the criminal justice system that sentenced Jeff -- a system that too often is unproductive, wasteful, and unfair. Bad policies are made, and bad policies can and should be changed. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","A Missouri man received a life sentence for possessing marijuana .

"Celebrity chef Paula Deen's contract with the Food Network will not be renewed, the network said Friday, the latest fallout over revelations that she admitted to using a racial epithet in the past. Deen's contract with the network, which airs three shows featuring the chef, expires at the end of the month, it said. The Food Network's announcement followed reports that Deen acknowledged in a lawsuit deposition using the ""N word."" Earlier in the week, the network said it would monitor the situation, but that it ""does not tolerate any form of discrimination."" In a statement, Deen thanked the network for 11 ""great years."" ""... I have had the pleasure of being allowed into so many homes across the country and meeting people who have shared with me the most touching and personal stories,"" she said. ""... This would not have been possible without the Food Network.  Thank you again.  Love and best dishes to all of ya'll."" Home shopping network QVC is likewise re-examining its business relationship with Deen, Paul Capelli, vice president of communications, told CNN. He stressed the company does not ""tolerate discriminatory behavior."" The shopping network features the cookware line ""Paula Deen's Kitchen,"" among other sponsored items. A Walmart spokesman declined to comment on that company's ties with Deen. Last week's events are stunning twists for the chef whose Southern, folksy flair with food made her a household name, spawning a line of kitchenware, cookware and food. The Food Network's announcement came on a head-spinning day of developments that began when Deen backed out of an interview with ""Today"" on NBC. She later apologized and begged for forgiveness in a video on YouTube that she pulled and replaced with a self-produced video where she again apologized. ""I want to apologize to everybody for the wrong that I've done,"" Deen said in the first video statement. ""I want to learn and grow from this. Inappropriate and hurtful language is totally, totally unacceptable. I've made plenty of mistakes along the way but I beg you, my children, my team, my fans, my partners, I beg for your forgiveness."" A short time later, Deen replaced the professionally edited video with one she made herself. In that video, she apologized for backing out of the interview, saying she was ""physically not able"" to do it at the time. ""I'm taking this opportunity now that I've pulled myself together and am able to speak to offer an apology to those that I have hurt,"" she said. ""... My family and I are not the kind of people the press are wanting to say we are,"" she said. ""...Your color, your religion, your sexual preference does not matter to me. But it's what's in the heart, and my family and I try to live by that."" Share your views on Deen; Did Food Network make the right decision? Deen's friend, Juda Engelmayer, said after Deen recorded the first statement, she said it was not what she wanted to say. ""She picked up her own handi-cam and recorded it herself without a production team present,"" said Engelmayer, who was with Deen at the time. Engelmayer is senior vice president of 5W Public Relations but doesn't officially represent Deen. Deen and her brother are being sued for alleged sexual and racial harassment by a former manager of Deen's restaurants in Savannah, Georgia. Lisa T. Jackson's lawsuit alleges that Deen and Bubba Hier committed numerous acts of violence, discrimination and racism that resulted in the end of her five-year tenure at Deen's Lady & Sons and Uncle Bubba's Oyster House eateries in Savannah. Deen: From the frying pan to the firestorm . Deen's lawyer has called the allegations false. ""Contrary to media reports, Ms. Deen does not condone or find the use of racial epithets acceptable,"" her lawyer, Bill Franklin said. ""She is looking forward to her day in court."" Deen confirms that she has type 2 diabetes, unveils partnership with drug company . The language in question was revealed recently as part of a deposition of Deen by Jackson's lawyers in May. Jackson lawyer: ""Miss Deen, have you told racial jokes?"" Deen: ""No, not racial."" Jackson lawyer: ""Have you ever used the 'N word' yourself?"" Deen: ""Yes, of course."" Deen testified that she probably used the racial slur when talking to her husband about ""when a black man burst into the bank that I was working at and put a gun to my head."" ""I didn't feel real favorable towards him,"" she said, referring to the robber. Jackson lawyer: ""Have you used it since then?"" Deen: ""I'm sure I have, but it's been a very long time."" Deen said she couldn't remember other contexts in which she used the slur, but ""maybe in repeating something that was said to me."" ""But that's just not a word that we use as time has gone on,"" she said. ""Things have changed since the '60s in the South. And my children and my brother object to that word being used in any cruel or mean behavior."" Deen's company issued a statement Thursday saying the chef used the epithet, but in a ""quite different time"" in American history. ""She was born 60 years ago when America's South had schools that were segregated, different bathrooms, different restaurants and Americans rode in different parts of the bus. This is not today.""","Home shopping network QVC is re-examining its ties .

"Jury selection was minutes away for five ex-New Orleans police officers accused of shooting unarmed civilians after Hurricane Katrina when a commenter ripped into the defendants on a newspaper website. ""NONE of these guys should had have [sic] ever been given a badge,"" the commenter, identified only as ""legacyusa,"" wrote. ""We should research how they got on the police department, who trained them, who supervised them and why were they ever been promoted. You put crap in -- you get crap out!!!"" ""Legacyusa"" turned out to be one of the top federal prosecutors in New Orleans. His post was just one of many anonymous barbs that led a federal judge Tuesday to throw out the convictions of those ex-cops in the Danziger Bridge shootings, which left two people dead and four seriously wounded. In a 129-page ruling, District Judge Kurt D. Engelhardt cited long list of ""egregious and inflammatory"" comments by at least three Justice Department officials using a variety of online identities. Those comments fueled a ""21st century carnival atmosphere"" that tainted the 2011 trial and will require a new one, Engelhardt wrote. ""This case started as one featuring allegations of brazen abuse of authority, violation of the law and corruption of the criminal justice system; unfortunately, though the focus has switched from the accused to the accusers, it has continued to be about those very issues,"" the order states. ""After much reflection, the court cannot journey as far as it has in this case only to ironically accept grotesque prosecutorial misconduct in the end."" In a statement issued Tuesday afternoon, the Justice Department said, ""We are disappointed with the court's ruling. We are reviewing the decision and considering our options."" The five officers were charged with firing on an unarmed family at the New Orleans bridge and at others who were attempting to flee the scene, which unfolded six days after Katrina flooded most of the city. They were found guilty on a total of 25 counts of civil rights violations, and in 2012, Engelhardt sentenced them to prison terms ranging from six to 65 years. Justice Department rules forbid prosecutors from making public comments that might influence the outcome of a case. But lawyers for the convicted officers accused prosecutors of mounting ""a secret public relations campaign"" aimed at discrediting the defendants before trial. ""The government's actions, and initial lack of candor and credibility thereafter, is like scar tissue that will long evidence infidelity to the principles of ethics, professionalism and basic fairness and common sense necessary to every criminal prosecutor, wherever it should occur in this country,"" Engelhardt wrote in granting them a new trial. ""Given the time, effort and energy invested by the court in this matter from the beginning, this is indeed a bitter pill to swallow,"" he added. Two top lieutenants of then-U.S. Attorney Jim Letten -- the office's top trial lawyer, Sal Perricone, aka ""legacyusa"" and other handles; and Jan Mann, the first assistant U.S. attorney -- had already been identified as having posted disparaging comments anonymously. Justice Department, New Orleans Police Department agree on overhaul . Perricone had been trash-talking the New Orleans Police Department from then-Superintendent Warren Riley on down since at least 2008, Tuesday's order states. Six months before the Danziger Bridge trials opened, with other officers on trial for their conduct in the post-Katrina chaos, Perricone called the NOPD ""a collection of self-centered, self-promoting, insular, arrogant, overweening, prevaricating, libidinous fools ... the entire agency should be re-engineered from the ground up."" The third official cited in the order was Karla Dobinski, a senior attorney in the Justice Department's civil rights division. In the Danziger Bridge case, Dobinski had led the department's ""taint team"" -- the group charged with reviewing evidence to make sure no statements given under a grant of immunity get used against defendants. Though not part of the prosecution, she posted to the New Orleans Times-Picayune six times during the trial to praise pro-prosecution commenters, according to Engelhardt's order. Dobinski told investigators she was trying to get information ""otherwise unavailable from the prosecution team,"" the order states. But Engelhardt said it was ""difficult to accept"" that explanation and said she ""fanned the flames"" of those calling for a guilty verdict. Mann and Perricone have left since their involvement was revealed in 2012, said Anna Christman, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office.

"For any professional woman, finding the right balance between work and family is never any easy task. And when your office job is racing Formula One cars for a living, the leap between the daily grind and bouncing baby feels even wider. It's a juggling act Maria de Villota will one day tackle -- she's just got a few things to do on the track first. De Villota became the first female driver in Formula One in 20 years after joining Russian team Marussia in March in a testing role. She now works alongside Marussia's newly-formed lineup of German veteran Timo Glock and French rookie Charles Pic, and plans to get behind the wheel during the 2012 season. The 32-year-old Spaniard admitted it's been a hard slog to get there -- and she's not going to give it up for a baby anytime soon. ""My family is huge and we are all the time together. Of course I would like to have the same thing for me. If you have a baby, I don't know how my body, my mind, is going to react,"" she told CNN. ""If one day I do make that decision I'll make sure that all my racing goals are achieved. I need to make sure of what I'm thinking  -- which is being competitive and not about a little kid waiting at home for me."" But de Villota is proof that kids and the track can mix, having grown up the daughter of former F1 driver Emilio de Villota. ""He was a driver in the late '70s, early '80s and I used to go to see him race. I remember the moment when he would tell me, 'Please hold my helmet.' It was really good having that chance being beside him,"" she said. ""I think he didn't want me to be a racing driver but in the end I just wanted to be like him."" Considering her racing family, it's no surprise De Villota took to the track at an early age -- an experience that gave her a taste of her dream job. ""My racing career started in Madrid, where I was born, in a go-kart track,"" she said. ""I remember it was Christmas time and my brother had a go-kart and I had my first drive that day. I was around five and I just went all the way into the front. ""He was crying and saying, 'You're crazy, I'm not going to share with you anymore.' "" De Villota is the first woman to be part of the elite motorsport since Italy's Giovanni Amati entered three grands prix for Brabham in 1992, but failed to qualify for a race. Just weeks after De Villota signed with Marussia, 29-year-old Briton Susie Wolff joined Williams as a test driver. Wolff is just the seventh female F1 driver in the 60-year history of the sport and her recruitment, along with De Villota, was seen as an important step forward in the gender divide. It hasn't been an easy ride, though. ""Being a woman didn't stop me. I realized I could do it and I could do it good,"" De Villota said. ""Endurance has been tough because we're not as strong as men. I had to work really hard in order to make sure I could be strong enough to be driving Formula One.""","Female F1 test driver Maria de Villota admits she'd like a family one day .

"Next month, U.S. President Barack Obama will become the first sitting American president to visit Myanmar, the strongest endorsement yet of the country's efforts to tread a path to democracy. Much has changed in a year since U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a historic visit to the country in December 2011. CNN was also invited to enter Myanmar, also known as Burma, for the first time in years.  With an official journalist visa stamped in our passport, we and other media invited for Clinton's visit, knew this was a big change for a country that has repelled any kind of scrutiny for half a century. Q&A: What's behind sectarian violence in Myanmar? Obama's visit will come at a time when Myanmar is in the news again but not for the right reasons. Violence between Rohingya Muslims and local Buddhists continues in Rakhine state in the west of the country. The United Nations says at least 89 people have been killed in the past two weeks and 110,000 are displaced.  Some aid organizations are questioning whether now is the right time for Obama to add legitimacy to the government of President Thein Sein. But there's no denying a lot has changed in the past year and a half. Read more: Aung San Suu Kyi has ""soft spot"" for the military generals . So far, a quasi-civilian government has been sworn in, although the military still holds great sway. Hundreds of political prisoners have been released, ceasefires have been signed between the government and some but not all ethnic groups. Political and economic reform is well underway. Another change that didn't make headlines but has been clear to us during numerous trips over that 12-month period is the attitude of the Burmese people. Last year, very few people would speak to us on camera or in some cases even off-camera for fear of retribution. Decades of brutal military rule turned freedom of speech into a luxury most could not afford. Aung San Suu Kyi: Peaceful freedom fighter . But just four months later, during a bi-election in which the freed opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her party won almost all seats, caution was thrown to the wind and celebrations were passionate and unrestrained. Thousands of jubilant Suu Kyi supporters spilled into the street, holding posters of the woman who had spent much of the past two decades under house arrest -- these were scenes which just a couple of years earlier would have ended in arrest and imprisonment. U Myint Maung, a man from Yangon, had a simple explanation of the election.  ""The people were living in prison. Aung San Suu Kyi held the key to open the door,"" he said. We, as journalists, were welcomed and thanked on the streets as if the fact we were there documenting these changes meant they could never be reversed. Read more: Myanmar eases restrictions on news organizations . But not one person we spoke to over many months said their lives had physically improved.  They were more hopeful and believed democracy was now possible but they were still struggling to survive. Daily life is hard for many Burmese. A country that was one of the richest in Asia 50 years ago is now one of the poorest. Authorities are struggling to shore up institutions and update laws to protect people and resources from hungry international investors snapping at Myanmar's heels. The ethnic unrest in Rahkine state has tested the efforts of President Thein Sein's administration to seek reconciliation with Myanmar's different ethnic groups. There's no doubt that some changes in Myanmar have been swift and Sein deserves the international praise he is receiving. But the transformation from pariah to ally is not complete and the skeptics among us worry it could yet stumble.","President Obama will become first sitting U.S. president to visit Myanmar .

"In 2004, Sen. John Kerry entered the campaign against incumbent President George W. Bush with a seemingly unassailable advantage on a sensitive issue -- the liberal Kerry served in the Vietnam War, and the conservative Bush didn't. Rather than avoid the topic, Bush supporters came up with the notorious ""Swift Boat"" campaign that raised enough questions about Kerry's war record to negate a major strength. Such ""attack the strength"" tactics have been a staple of this year's presidential race, with both sides trying to undermine perceived advantages of the other. The latest example is a new Web video that accuses President Barack Obama of engineering classified leaks and claiming undue credit on his signature foreign policy achievement: the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The premise is simple: In a political environment where perception often trumps policy, mount early challenges to your opponent's strongest attributes to raise questions and create an alternative image in the minds of voters. For example, the Obama campaign has attacked certain Republican nominee Mitt Romney's successful business career, portraying the venture capitalist company he founded as a pioneer in outsourcing American jobs. The purpose was to blunt Romney's persistent claim that his business background made him better qualified than Obama to manage the slow-recovering economy, the most important issue to voters. Meanwhile, Romney's team is challenging Obama on the volatile issue of reforming Medicare, the popular health care program for senior citizens. By naming House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan as his running mate last week, Romney and his team knew the Obama campaign would attack Ryan's proposal to partially privatize Medicare, so they have tried to turn the tables by accusing the president this week of cutting more than $700 billion out of the government-run system. Both of the attacks are misleading or untrue, according to independent assessments. Websites such as PolitiFact.com and Fact.Check.org ruled that outsourcing by Romney's company, Bain Capital, occurred after he gave up daily management responsibilities in 1999. On Medicare, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that reforms to the program under Obama's 2010 health care law resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars in savings, rather than spending cuts that reduced benefits, as alleged by the Romney campaign. PolitiFact rated the Romney campaign's claim as ""mostly false."" To Republican strategist Ron Bonjean , the Romney camp's maneuver on Medicare was ""a brilliant move."" ""They are going to be attacked on it anyway. They have 'jujitsued' this,"" Bonjean told CNN on Friday, adding: ""It's a good idea to try to neutralize this issue right now, which I think they are being very effective at."" Outside groups supporting the candidates also are taking part. A video spot by Priorities USA Action, a super-PAC backing Obama, sought to link Romney to the death of the wife of a steel worker who lost his job at a plant closed down by Bain Capital. The ad, which has yet to be scheduled for broadcast, was rated ""false"" by PolitiFact. Now, a little-known group of former special forces members called the Special Operations OPSEC Education Fund has released the 22-minute Web video that criticizes Obama on the bin Laden takedown. A spokeswoman says the group has raised about $1 million toward an advertising campaign in some key swing states, but refused to discuss donors. Over a picture of Obama, the video's narrator says that the group's mission is to stop politicians from using sensitive intelligence about the bin Laden raid and other clandestine programs for political benefit. The organization, which describes itself as nonpartisan, shares an office with two Republican political consulting firms in Alexandria, Virginia. Its spokesman, Chad Kolton, worked for the Bush administration as a spokesman for the Director of National Intelligence, and its president ran for Congress as a Republican. To Darrell West of the Brookings Institution, the video evokes memories of the Swift Boat campaign that mounted a barrage of negative attacks against Kerry's war record. ""Obama's strong suit actually is on national security,"" said West, the vice president and director of governance studies at Brookings. ""He's the guy who got bin Laden, and that's been a central claim of his campaign. So there's always a risk of the opposition coming in with this type of ad to try to undermine the president's credibility and take away what is really his strong suit."" The president has regularly cited the killing of bin Laden as a campaign promise he fulfilled, and the head of special operations, Adm. William  McRaven, recently told CNN that Obama deserved credit. ""Make no mistake about it: It was the president of the United States that shouldered the burden for this operation, that made the hard decisions,"" McRaven said. Like other top officials, including Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, McRaven also has been highly critical of recent leaks about clandestine operations. The White House has denied leaking classified information, and two federal prosecutors have been assigned to investigate recent leaks about the Stuxnet virus and drone strike operations. Republicans blame Obama for the leaks that occurred on his watch, and they call for an independent investigation. The ""attack the strength"" tactic is nothing new, but gained prominence last decade when utilized by Republican strategist Karl Rove, who guided Bush's two presidential campaigns . ""Karl Rove did something that many other political operatives don't do, and it's really an element of why he's a unique figure in American political life,"" journalist Wayne Slater said in a PBS Frontline documentary titled ""Karl Rove: The Architect."" ""He understands that while other people look for the weakness in an opponent and exploit that, Rove has long looked at the strength of an opponent."" That was particularly true of the Swift Boat attacks on Kerry, said Slater, co-author of the book ""Bush's Brain: How Karl Rove Made George W. Bush Presidential."" ""The No. 1 thing that John Kerry offered was his heroic service in Vietnam,"" Slater said in the PBS documentary, ""and so what Rove did was attack the strength of Kerry, not his weakness."" Others clearly  took notice. In attacking Romney's background at Bain Capital, the Obama campaign is following the example of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich from the Republican primary campaign. Gingrich's criticism that Romney's business record included shutting down companies and outsourcing jobs got panned by many fellow Republicans. In response, Gingrich said his attacks were only the initial salvos of an all-out assault on the issue that Romney would face from the Obama campaign if he became the nominee.","A GOP strategist says the Romney campaign ""jujitsued"" Obama on Medicare .

"John Grisham is taking back statements he made about child pornography and sex offenders. In a recent interview with the UK's Telegraph, the lawyer and prolific author of books and Hollywood adaptations such as ""The Firm,"" ""The Pelican Brief"" and ""A Time to Kill"" sparked outrage when he expressed his belief that some people who view child pornography online are receiving punishments that don't match the scale of the crime. ""We have prisons now filled with guys my age, 60-year-old white men, in prison, who've never harmed anybody (and) would never touch a child,"" Grisham said during a conversation about high U.S. prison rates. ""But they got online one night and started surfing around, probably had too much to drink or whatever, and pushed the wrong buttons and went too far and got into child porn. ... They deserve some type of punishment, but 10 years in prison? ""There's so many of them now, sex offenders ... that they put them in the same prison, like they're a bunch of perverts or something."" He then used an old law school friend as an example: . ""I have no sympathy for a real pedophile. But so many of these guys don't deserve harsh prison sentences. A friend of mine, this was 10 years ago, was drinking, and his drinking was out of control. And he went to a website, and it was labeled, 16-year-old wannabe hookers or something, some stupid website. And it said 16-year-old girls. So he went there and downloaded some stuff. ""It was 16-year-old girls that look 30. ... He shouldn't have done it. It was stupid. But it wasn't 10-year-old boys, and he didn't touch anything."" To Grisham's recollection, the website his friend visited was actually a sting operation to capture sex offenders. He said his friend was then sent to prison for three years. Those comments and the nature in which Grisham discussed the very serious issue of child pornography incited a flood of hurt, disappointed and angry reactions from fans. ""The day that you came out in an interview and said that watchers of child porn get too stiff of a penalty for it (you said 10 years was too much) makes you someone that I cannot support nor no longer want to read,"" a reader named Kendra Benefield Lausman shared on Grisham's Facebook page; another posted that she's taken her entire Grisham library to her ""burn barrel"" with the intent to set the books on fire. ""How do you think child porn is made?"" a poster named John Kelly asked on Grisham's page. ""Someone is still getting hurt you imbecile. I'm sad to say that I will never purchase, nor consume, one of your books ever again. I am disgusted."" After the uproar began, Grisham issued an apology. ""Anyone who harms a child for profit or pleasure, or who in any way participates in child pornography -- online or otherwise -- should be punished to the fullest extent of the law,"" the author said in a statement. ""My comments made two days ago during an interview with the British newspaper The Telegraph were in no way intended to show sympathy for those convicted of sex crimes, especially the sexual molestation of children. I can think of nothing more despicable. I regret having made these comments, and apologize to all."" That may not be enough for some of his former followers. ""You clearly said in the interview that people (like your drunk friend) who look at child porn don't deserve severe punishment,"" Facebook user Raylene Jolly Wheeler posted in response to Grisham. ""Not sure how you can backtrack that statement.""","John Grisham has apologized for comments he made about child porn .

"(CNN)Hope Solo, the soccer star who makes headlines whether she's winning Olympic gold or having domestic violence accusations dropped against her, did it again Wednesday when she was suspended from the U.S. Women's National Team for 30 days. The team said the suspension stemmed from ""an incident that occurred during the current WNT training camp being held in Carson, California."" Solo's husband, former pro football player Jerramy Stevens, was charged with driving under the influence during the early morning hours Monday in Manhattan Beach, California, about 12 miles from Carson. The Los Angeles Times reported that Solo was in the passenger seat. ""I accept and respect the Federation's decision, and more importantly, I apologize for disappointing my teammates, coaches and the Federation who have always supported me,"" Solo said in a statement posted on her Facebook page. ""I think it's best for me to take a break, decompress from the stress of the last several months, and come back mentally and physically ready to positively contribute to the team."" The suspension means Solo, a goalkeeper, will miss the U.S. team's matches in France and England in February. She can apply for reinstatement when the suspension ends. ""During our current National Team camp, Hope made a poor decision that has resulted in a negative impact on U.S. Soccer and her teammates,"" said U.S. Women's National Team head coach Jill Ellis said in a statement. ""We feel at this time it is best for her to step away from the team."" Solo is perhaps the United States' best-known female soccer player, winning Olympic gold medals twice and playing on World Cup teams in 2007 and 2011. Sometimes she draws attention for off-the-field activities. Earlier this month, domestic assault charges against Solo were dismissed by a judge in Washington state. CNN affiliate KOMO reported that attorney Todd Maybrown successfully argued in court that he couldn't depose witnesses for the prosecution because they refused to be questioned despite a court order. Police had said Solo, 33, assaulted two relatives in June at a home in the Seattle area. Officers responded to a 911 call in which a man reported that a woman would not stop ""hitting people"" or leave the house, a police statement said. At the home, officers heard a disturbance. Inside, Solo appeared ""intoxicated and upset,"" according to police. Police said Solo's nephew and sister had visible injuries. Police believed that Solo was the ""primary aggressor and had instigated the assault,"" the statement said. She appeared on ABC's ""Dancing With the Stars"" in 2011.  She was eliminated from the show following a run on the show marred by frequent disputes with pro partner Maksim Chmerkovskiy and the judging panel. In 2012, Solo sent out a harsh tweet criticizing Olympic soccer commentator Brandi Chastain for her negative commentary during the 2012 London games. During the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup, Solo openly criticized U.S. women's soccer coach Greg Ryan after she was benched and the U.S. lost its next match by four goals. In an interview with CNN two years ago, Solo spoke about her public image. ""I have a bad rap,"" she said. ""People look at me as selfish, outspoken. But I know who I am."" The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency in 2012 publicly warned Solo after she tested positive for a banned diuretic -- a substance she claimed she didn't know was in premenstrual medication prescribed by her physician. The agency accepted Solo's explanation, and she competed in the 2012 Olympics. ""I don't expect any of the media to be positive,"" Solo told CNN in 2012. ""But I know that I'm doing wonderful things for the sport of soccer, and I know I'm doing amazing things for female athletes. So I can take it.""","U.S. Soccer team suspends star goalkeeper Hope Solo for 30 days .

"(CNN) -- Recently, the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection successfully ignited a public discussion about dietary supplements. It's about time. But this is only a first step, and of no substantive value without continued careful objective and scientific re-evaluation of how we view these products. The $30 billion dietary supplements industry, one of the fastest growing industries in the world, has reason to celebrate. More than half of Americans are taking supplements. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the passage of one of the most skillful pieces of legislation ever to undermine the health of Americans: The Dietary Supplement Health and Educational Act of 1994. The result was to remove from regulation by the Food and Drug Administration any substances labeled as a dietary supplement. The act was passed with strong bipartisan support. After all, shouldn't we make it easier for Americans to access good nutrition? If it is nutrition, isn't it good for you? And, if a nutrient is essential for an important body function, shouldn't more of it improve that body function? But supplements are not quite the amazing panacea that we have been led to believe. Supplements, which include substances such as vitamins and herbs, but can also include hormones and other pharmacologically active ingredients, can impact the effect and safety of various medications and alter our body's physiologic functions. For instance, severe bleeding has been reported as a result of supplements taken at recommended doses around the time of even minor surgery. This is of great concern given that a survey conducted by researchers at the University of Colorado found that 40% of patients undergoing surgery were taking herbal and vitamin supplements that block normal blood clotting and predispose them to excessive bleeding, and 17% were taking supplements that may prolong the effect of anesthesia. Nutrients are chemicals, and almost all are known to have toxicity when taken in high doses. Look in any nutrition textbook and you will find lists of vitamin toxicities, some of which may even be fatal. For example, overdose of vitamin A will cause brain swelling and liver failure. This is, fortunately, not common. But intake of vitamin A, only slightly higher than the recommended daily allowance, has been associated with thinning of bones and a higher risk for fractures. Some supplements, like zinc, may cause harm even at low doses, since it can cause a significant decrease in the levels of copper, another essential mineral for the body. Vitamin E and selenium supplements have both been proven, in a well-designed randomized trial with more than 35,000 men, to cause statistically significant increases in the incidence of aggressive prostate cancer. The National Cancer Institute felt the results were concerning enough to post them on their website, with a strongly worded warning that men should not take these, despite the claims of supplement proponents who vehemently deny the scientific data, based on outlandish theories. Nor do these proponents disclose conflicts of interest, which real scientists are ethically bound to reveal when they are in a position to make personal gains. Despite the proven risks, the market is glutted with supplement companies and vitamin pushers who argue that supplements, from multivitamins to herbal cures for everything from the common cold to obesity, are natural and thus, safe. They fiercely advocate for keeping access to dietary supplements unfettered by government regulation, claiming that further regulation would unfairly deprive the public of access to these potentially beneficial substances. They cite theory and inappropriate data to support their claims and dismiss any evidence to the contrary. Proper randomized studies, such as those performed to establish safety and efficacy of prescription medications, are needed to establish cause and effect of supplements. Such studies require large numbers of patients and are extremely costly. Without regulatory pressures, there is little motivation for industry to do the studies, even as supplements bring in large profits from sales to the American public. The other option is observational or epidemiological research, which is easier and less expensive. But conclusions from these studies can only be used to note the coincidence of events, not cause and effect. Erroneous conclusions are often drawn (e.g., only overweight people are on diets, therefore being on diets causes obesity). And guesswork, which some supplement proponents use to deny the science, costs nothing. Most people, scientists and nonscientists, are not aware of the weaknesses in the scientific data on supplements. Part of this misunderstanding is the fault of us nutrition experts, who want very much to provide something to slake the hunger of the public for advice on what to do to stay young, thin, fit and healthy, and are loathe to say ""we don't know."" It is a hopeful sign that this issue has come to the attention of the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection. But there is so much to be done. Just because a product is brought to market and labeled as a dietary supplements, guarantees neither efficacy nor, more importantly, safety. On this anniversary of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, with lawmakers now willing to challenge this powerful industry, it is time to reassess the regulation of dietary supplements, consider our priorities in how funding is granted for nutrition research, reeducate the community of nutrition experts as well as the public, and be honest about our inability to offer definitive, safe and effective nutritional recommendations.","More than half of Americans are taking supplements, fueling a $30 billion industry .

"(CNN)When other women ask Christine Lagarde about coping with failure -- and they often do -- the head of the International Monetary Fund doesn't mince her words. ""Oh get over it. Get over it and move on,"" says the fifth most powerful women in the world according to Forbes. ""I've failed myself. Twice I tried to enter the National School of Administration in the French system and I failed."" Legarde might have failed twice, but the 59-year-old is a woman of firsts. She is the first woman to chair the global law firm Baker and McKenzie. The first female finance minister of France. And since 2011, the first woman to lead the IMF. The mother-of-two's philosophy is to learn from her failures, adding: ""and then you move on."" ""Moving on"" is something Lagarde is trying to do now. Last year magistrates placed Lagarde under formal investigation in regards to a political fraud case, dating back to her days as a French finance minister. Lagarde is appealing the decision. But how does she cope with the weight of these allegations? ""With strength, with my sense of duty to my country, with the certainty that I made the right choice at the time independently,"" she said. We asked other women at the top of their fields about the biggest failures of their careers. Like Lagarde, many said set backs can later become sources of great strength. ""My mother would tell me from a very young age never to be afraid of failing,"" Huffington told CNN's Leading Women. ""I was absolutely fine taking risks. Trying to get into Cambridge when everybody said you'll never get in, or writing my first book when I was 23. ""A lot of things were likely to fail and many did fail.

"Estonia summoned Russia's ambassador on Friday to demand an explanation regarding what it described as the abduction of a security official near its joint border. The news came the same day Russia announced it had detained an Estonia security officer in its northwest Pskov region, where Russian officials allege he was carrying out an undercover operation, according to a report from state-run news agency Itar-Tass. The dueling claims follow mounting tensions between the two nations. Just days earlier, U.S. President Barack Obama visited Estonia, where he promised to protect the Baltic nation against Russian aggression. Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet called the abduction of the Internal Security Service official by unidentified individuals from Russia, near the Luhamaa border checkpoint, a ""very disturbing incident."" ""We expect to receive all manner of help and cooperation necessary from Russia in solving this case and bringing the Estonian citizen back to Estonia,"" Paet said, according to the Estonian Foreign Ministry. Neither Paet nor the Foreign Ministry provided details as to how they know the individuals are Russian. Meanwhile, Russia confirmed it detained a man named Eston Kohver, who its security service, known as the FSB, said was detained on Russian soil. The Estonian officer ""had a Taurus handgun, an amount of €5,000 in cash, equipment for covert audio recording, and materials indicative of an intelligence mission,"" Itar-Tass reported, citing the FSB.","Estonia's foreign minister says unidentified Russia individuals are behind abduction .

"Her requests for parole and a prison transfer recently denied, a member of the punk rock collective Pussy Riot was hospitalized amid a hunger strike Friday, according to Russian state-run media. Doctors ordered that Nadezhda Tolokonnikova be placed in the medical ward of a penal colony in Mordovia, southeast of Moscow, where she is serving a two-year sentence, reported RIA Novosti, citing the Russian penitentiary service. Her hospitalization came just hours after her request to be transferred to another prison was denied, her lawyer, Dmitry Dinze, told the media outlet. Tolokonnikova, 23, announced she was launching a hunger strike earlier this week. Her only sustenance for the last five days has been water, according to RIA Novosti. In a lengthy letter to the news site Lenta (a translated version was published in London's The Guardian), Tolokonnikova described ""slave labor"" and unsanitary conditions in which women work through sickness and injury up to 17 hours a day and are beaten -- or worse -- for failing to complete their duties. Tolokonnikova wrote that her life was once threatened and other prisoners tell her she is not beaten only because of the celebrity her case has brought her. ""It's true: Others are beaten up. For not being able to keep up. They hit them in the kidneys, in the face. Prisoners themselves deliver these beatings, and not a single one of them is done without the approval and full knowledge of the administration,"" she wrote. ""Mordovian prisoners are afraid of their own shadows. They are completely terrified."" Prison authorities told RIA Novosti that Tolokonnikova was blackmailing them for denying her request for special treatment, but her husband told Russian media this week that a guard had refused to give her water and grabbed her by the arms, refusing to let go. Those claims, too, were denied, as a penitentiary spokesman told RIA Novosoti that doctors recommended only that she be given warm water and no physical force had been used against her. Tolokonnikova and two other band members were imprisoned last year for ""hooliganism"" after Pussy Riot performed a ""punk prayer"" critical of then-Prime Minister, now President, Vladimir Putin at a Russian Orthodox cathedral. Video of the performance went viral. While Tolokonnikova and bandmate Maria Alyokhina remain in prison, a third Pussy Riot member, Yekaterina Samutsevich, was released in October 2012 after her defense presented new evidence in her case. In July, Mordovia's Supreme Court upheld a decision to deny Tolokonnikova parole, and last month lawyers for Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina requested that the court allow the pair to do community service in lieu of completing their sentences. Tolokonnikova is scheduled to be released in March. It's unclear if she will end her hunger strike as her letter to Lenta this week states she won't relent until prison conditions change. ""I am going on hunger strike and refusing to participate in colony slave labor,"" she wrote. ""I will do this until the administration starts obeying the law and stops treating incarcerated women like cattle ejected from the realm of justice for the purpose of stoking the production of the sewing industry; until they start treating us like humans.""","Pussy Riot member is hospitalized in a medical ward, state-run media reports .

"(CNN) -- After weeks of speculation, CBS has confirmed that James Corden is the next host of the network's ""The Late Late Show."" The official announcement, which arrived Monday, wasn't a surprise. Back in August, reports indicated that Corden was being considered as the replacement for current host Craig Ferguson, who announced in April that he plans to depart at the end of the year. Craig Ferguson to leave ""The Late Late Show"" In a statement, CBS Entertainment Chairman Nina Tassler praised Brit personality Corden as a ""rare entertainment force who combines irresistible charm, warmth and originality with a diverse range of creative instincts and performance talent. He is the ultimate multi-hyphenate -- a writer, creator and performer who is loved and respected in every medium he touches, including theater, comedy, music, film and television."" Corden's expected to take over ""The Late Late Show"" in 2015, although it's unclear whether the show will stay in Los Angeles, as CNNMoney reports. CNNMoney: What James Corden represents for CBS . In the meantime, here's what those unfamiliar with Corden should know: . 1. He's already a familiar face in Britain . If you're a fan of UK programming, you probably already know James Corden well. As an actor he got his start in the 1997 dramedy ""24 7: Twenty Four Seven,"" and then bounced around between film, the stage and TV, including an appearance on ""Doctor Who."" In 2008, he won a BAFTA for television comedy performance with the series he co-created and starred in, ""Gavin & Stacey."" 2. You'll see more of him this year at the movies . If you've seen Keira Knightley's musical drama with Mark Ruffalo, ""Begin Again,"" then you spotted Corden playing Steve, the best friend of Knightley's character. This fall, Corden's also starring as ""Britain's Got Talent"" winner Paul Potts in the October biopic ""One Chance,"" and he'll play the Baker in Disney's anticipated December release, ""Into the Woods."" 3. He has a strong social media following . He may not be as well-known Stateside as he is overseas, but The Wrap pointed out in August that Corden has something CBS execs would want: 4.3 million followers on Twitter. As late-night hosts from Jimmy Fallon to Stephen Colbert have shown, having a social army can only help. 4. He's a Tony winner . How does Corden do in front of a live audience? Just fine, apparently. When Corden starred in the play ""One Man, Two Guvnors"" on Broadway, he won a Tony for it in 2012. 5. Yes, he has some hosting and interviewing experience . In addition to co-hosting the sports-themed comedy show ""A League of Their Own,"" Corden's manned the stage for the BRIT Awards since 2011, after first hosting the music show in 2009. CNN's Brian Stelter contributed to this report.","James Corden will replace Craig Ferguson on ""The Late Late Show""
Reports in August suggested that the British actor and comedian would do so .
He isn't exactly a household name in the U.S., but he does have hosting experience .
He's also worked across film, TV and theater ."
"Bronx, New York (CNN)It started with a challenge Adam Green accepted almost 20 years ago. During a semester off from college, he was volunteering at a middle school in East Harlem. ""The teacher there said he'd had this dream to build a boat with his kids, but had never had the time to do it,"" Green said. ""(He) wondered if I wanted to take on the job."" Green, who grew up in New York, knew nothing about building boats. But, armed with a set of plans and a bunch of salvaged wood, he and a group of students set out determined to build one. Eight months later, they had constructed a rowboat. When they put it to the test in the school's pool, their 8-foot dinghy floated. ""It was just the most magical thing,"" Green said. ""Creating something that's not just real, but actually works and can get you somewhere ... was thrilling for me and for the kids."" The experience had such a profound impact, Green was inspired to use the same concept to help other young people in need. Today, his nonprofit, Rocking the Boat, empowers youth from the South Bronx to work together and build wooden boats from scratch. They use them to row and sail and do river restoration. ""Our work is really all about using boats to build kids,"" said Green, 41. ""We want to give kids a chance to create something of themselves and then be able to go off and succeed out in the rest of the world."" A river in the Bronx? Many Rocking the Boat students live in or near Hunts Point, one of the roughest areas of the South Bronx. According to the New York State Education Department, only about 42% of students in the Hunts Point area graduate high school. Of those students, only 12% are prepared for college. ""It's a really, really challenging place to live,"" Green said. ""Dangerous streets, crime, drugs, prostitution. All these things are swirling around our kids. They're walking through it every day."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2014 CNN Heroes . Amid the area's scrap metal yards and industrial warehouses, the organization's brightly lit workshop and spacious backyard give students a different reality to walk into. Its location also provides easy access to the Bronx River -- something many people in the community never knew existed. ""The Bronx River is really one of the most hidden gems of New York City,"" Green said. ""It has tons of birds and fish and all kinds of native plant life. ... It's this quiet, protected, calm place where young people can grow."" Students learn boating skills and conduct research on the river. They monitor local wildlife, measure bacteria levels and grow oysters and seaweed that help filter bacteria out of the water. ""It provides a platform for them to really make an impact and care about something,"" Green said. ""They can have a great time on the river, but also (have) a chance to change it and to make it better."" The group also brings the community together on the river, offering free rowing to the public on Saturdays through the summer. A lifetime membership . Rocking the Boat serves more than 3,000 people a year through its broad community programs. Beginning in ninth grade, students can apply for the group's core youth programs, which offer opportunities over multiple years. Working in the shop or on the water, participants learn to use all kinds of tools and sharpen their math and science skills. They set goals, build self-confidence and develop leadership, communication and problem-solving abilities. ""This is a real way to connect to kids and give them a sense of purpose and value and a reason for learning,"" Green said. Students also receive comprehensive support from a social worker to address issues, learn life skills, finish high school and apply to college or trade school. Alumni continue to receive support through college; a number of them are hired as program assistants. This year, Green said, all 12 seniors in the program graduated high school and are headed to college. Alyssa Colon is one of them. She joined Rocking the Boat three years ago when she was seeking an artistic outlet. ""I really had a bad attitude about high school. I didn't like going,"" she said. The 18-year-old now credits the program with her acceptance to the Rhode Island School of Design, which she will attend this fall. ""The program has taught me that I can take on any challenge. I've applied so many of the skills that I learned here,"" she said. ""If I wasn't part of this, I don't know where I would be."" Green said he is inspired every day knowing his efforts are helping students like Colon tap into their potential. ""They can really go anywhere and do anything. They've already got what it takes,"" he said. ""They just need to put it to work."" Want to get involved?

"On Monday morning, the first porn app for Google Glass was announced. Unfortunately, the app violated the most recent additions to Google's developer policies for the futuristic eyewear, which ban sexually explicit material. The pornographic app for Glass was released by MiKandi, an adult app store that has a successful Android app store for adult apps. Using the application, Google Glass wearers could look at photos and watch videos filmed using Google Glass. The company wanted to expand from first-person point of view videos to one-on-one interactions between adults who both have Glass. Now it seems that business plan will need to be altered. Google added a new section to its developer policies for Google Glass late last week that prohibits apps from delivering sexually explicit content. ""Our policies make it clear that Glass does not allow Glassware content that contains nudity, graphic sex acts, or sexually explicit material. Any Glassware that violates this policy will be blocked from appearing on Glass,"" a Google spokesperson said. The same section promises harsh penalties for any app featuring child pornography. Google also bans gratuitous violence, hate speech and gambling on Glass. The connected Glass headset features a tiny screen above the right eye that can display Internet content. The device is still in beta mode and is not expected to go on sale to the general public until late this year or early 2014. More than 10,000 people have visited the landing page for the porn app, and a dozen Glass owners have signed up with the app, MiKandi CEO Jesse Adams said in a blog post. He said the company made sure it was following the Google Glass developer terms when it started creating the app two weeks ago, but those rules were changed by Google just before the app's launch. MiKandi will comply with the new rules, and plans on rolling out a new app that somehow doesn't include any of the forbidden content. ""Although the app is still live and people are using it, at this point we must make changes to the app in order to comply with the new policies. Expect to see changes to the application tomorrow,"" Adams said in a blog post. This is not the first time the adult company has gone up against Silicon Valley giants. In 2011, Apple sent the company a cease and desist letter for using the phrase ""app store"" in its tagline. It has also had apps rejected from the iOS and Android app stores before. Google Glass is a completely new product, and the public is still figuring out how and if it will be used. The company is working hard to avoid a sullied reputation for the wearable computer before it it is publicly released.

"(CNN)Jon Stewart ripped into Mike Huckabee on the ""Daily Show"" Monday, saying the former Arkansas governor was being hypocritical in his recent criticism of Beyoncé. In his book that was released Tuesday, ""God, Guns, Grits and Gravy,"" Huckabee rails against what he describes as the artist's ""explicit"" style and questions whether her husband, Jay-Z, is ""exploiting his wife as a sex object."" Beyonce, 'My Dog Skip' and cigarettes: 7 things we learned in Mike Huckabee's new book . The potential presidential contender, who recently ended his Fox News show, also argued that the Obamas shouldn't let their daughters listen to the multiplatinum singer because ""what you put in your brain is also important, as well as what you put into your body."" On the show Monday, Huckabee argued that Beyoncé is a ""megatalent"" and doesn't need to resort to being ""vulgar in order to set a trend,"" especially given her role model status for young girls. ""Do you know any parent who has a daughter and says 'Honey, if you make really good grades, someday when you're 12 or 13, we'll get you your own stripper pole'.  I mean c'mon Jon, we don't do that in our culture,"" he said. That's when Stewart jumped in, interrupting Huckabee to say he's ""diminishing Beyoncé in a way that's truly outrageous."" Opinion: Why Beyonce's feminism scares Huckabee . He then played a clip of Huckabee jamming with controversial rocker Ted Nugent to the song ""Cat Scratch Fever"" on Huckabee's former Fox show.

""They know just where to go when they need some lovin' man / They know I'm doin' it, that I'm doing it all the time."" Stewart questioned Huckabee on why Nugent gets a pass. ""You excuse that type of crudeness because you agree with his stance on firearms,"" Stewart said. ""You don't approve of Beyoncé because she seems alien to you."" Mike Huckabee gets serious about a second presidential run . ""Johnny Cash shot a man just to watch him die!"" Stewart joked, referencing the lyrics of ""Folsom Prison Blues."" Huckabee responded arguing the Nugent song ""is an adult song, geared for adults,"" but modern culture has lower standards when it comes to ""things that are considered perfectly OK for kids."" ""That's the difference,"" he continued. ""You can't single out a corrosive culture and ignore the one that you live in because you're used to it,"" Stewart retorted.","Jon Stewart called out Mike Huckabee for saying Beyoncé was too 'vulgar'

"FIFA was under growing pressure Sunday after one of its key sponsors demanded an investigation into corruption allegations published in a British newspaper over the controversial award of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. In its second batch of reports, Britain's Sunday Times made a series of new revelations, centered on the role of Qatar's former top football official Mohammed bin Hammam, in the nation's bid to stage the global showpiece. Electronics giant Sony, listed as one of FIFA's six key partners, wants the world governing body to act promptly. ""We expect these allegations to be investigated appropriately, and continue to expect FIFA to adhere to its principles of integrity, ethics and fair play across all aspects of its operations,"" Sony said in a statement to CNN. The reports come the day before FIFA officially concludes its own probe into the 2018 and 2022 bids, won by Russia and Qatar. It is being led by its chief investigator Michael Garcia, the former U.S. attorney who is to make his findings public in mid-July through FIFA's new adjudicatory chamber. Sportswear company Adidas, one of the other five partners, also voiced its concern Sunday over the issue. ""A report is due to be submitted to the adjudicatory chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee, with findings then released publicly in due course. We are confident that the matter is being dealt with as a priority,"" Adidas said in a statement released to CNN. ""Adidas enjoys a long-term and successful partnership with FIFA that we are looking forward to continue. Having said that, the negative tenor of the public debate around FIFA at the moment is neither good for football nor for FIFA and its partners."" Another main sponsor, Visa, said it's taking a wait-and-see approach. ""We understand FIFA is taking this matter seriously and we will continue to monitor its internal investigation,"" it said. ""We expect FIFA will take the appropriate actions to respond to the report and its recommendations."" The six main FIFA sponsors are believed to have collectively paid around $180 million as part of their sponsorship agreements. Sony's deal is due to expire this year having been in place for the 2010 and 2014 World Cups. Among the latest Sunday Times allegations were claims that bin Hammam had acted as a broker between Qatari officials and governments to set up lucrative bilateral trade deals as an incentive to gather support for their bid. The newspaper insists it has had access to millions of emails, documents and bank records to show bin Hamman used a $5 million slush fund to influence the bidding process, but CNN has not had access to this material to verify its accuracy. Bin Hammam refused to directly respond to the Sunday Times allegations, but told the newspaper he believed ""that the truth will find its way to (the) public one way or another."" The 63-year-old first came to prominence when he challenged Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency in 2011 but was forced to withdraw to fight bribery allegations. He was later cleared of the allegations, but in 2012 he was banned for life by FIFA's ethics committee for ""conflicts of interest"" while president of the Asian Football Confederation. Qatar World Cup organizers have continually denied that bin Hammam had any official or unofficial role in the bidding process and remain confident that they will not lose the rights to stage the competition. In response to the latest reports,  the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy released a new statement to CNN. ""In regards to the most recent allegations by The Sunday Times, the Supreme Committee stands by its previous statement,"" it said. ""There is an ongoing investigation into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bid process with which we have fully cooperated,"" it said. ""Qatar has won the bid on its merits and we are confident at the end of the appropriate process, the award of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar will stand."" From the moment the decision was made in late 2010 for Qatar to become the first Arab state to host a World Cup finals, there has been a series of controversies. The extreme summer heat, with temperatures as high as 50 degrees C, has led to calls for the tournament to be switched to a date during the European winter -- coming into conflict with the major football leagues such as the EPL and La Liga . FIFA has also called for improvements in conditions for migrant workers amid damning reports from international labor organizations and Amnesty International. With the 2014 World Cup in Brazil due to start Thursday, FIFA officials have been gathering in the South American country for their annual Congress in Sao Paulo between June 9 and 12. FIFA president Sepp Blatter is expected to announce his candidacy for a fifth four-year term as head of the organization. FIFA has made no official comment on the latest allegations but Blatter took to social media to defend FIFA's handling of the affair. ""Never ignoring media reports on ethics allegations in football. But let the Ethics Committee work!"" he tweeted.","Key FIFA sponsor demands action over corruption allegations .

"Hey kids! Forget trying to become a doctor or rapper or a football star, not to mention all the teasing you may get in school for being a nerd -- computers are where it's at. That's one message of a new video in which Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and other tech execs urge young people to learn computer programming. ""Learning how to program didn't start off with wanting to learn all of computer science or trying to master this discipline or anything like that,"" Zuckerberg says. ""It started off because I wanted to do this one simple thing -- I wanted to make something that was fun for myself and my sisters."" Gates says, ""I was 13 when I first got access to a computer. I wrote a program to play tick-tack-toe."" The five-minute clip, called ""What Most Schools Don't Teach,"" was posted online Tuesday by Code.org, a new nonprofit foundation that seeks to cultivate computer science in U.S. school curricula. The foundation argues there is a worldwide shortage of computer programmers but that only 1 in 10 schools in America teach kids how to code. ""Our policy (at Facebook) is literally to hire as many talented engineers as we can find,"" Zuckerberg says. ""The whole limit in the system is that there aren't enough people who are trained and have these skills today."" The Facebook CEO appears to be passionate about supporting technology and science education. Last week Zuckerberg and a handful of other tech execs announced a $3 million annual prize for researchers doing life-saving work, saying he hoped it would inspire future scientists. The ""What Most Schools Don't Teach"" clip tries to make coding seem accessible and easy for anyone with a basic understanding of math. ""Addition, subtraction, that's about it,"" Gates says with a smile. ""It's really not unlike playing an instrument, or playing a sport,"" says Drew Houston, who created file-sharing site Dropbox. ""Even if you want to become a race-car driver, or play baseball, or, you know, build a house -- all of these things have been turned upside down by software."" Also featured in the video are musician Will.i.am and NBA star Chris Bosh, both of whom have taken coding classes. There's been much recent hand-wringing in Silicon Valley about how the United States is lagging behind other countries in developing future software engineers. Code.org claims that computer-programming jobs are growing at twice the U.S. national average while less than 2.4% of college students graduate with degrees in computer science -- less than 10 years ago. The video also emphasizes the perks and casual vibe of working at a deep-pocketed tech company, where employees get free food, work barefoot and skateboard around the office. ""The programmers of tomorrow are the wizards of the future,"" says Gabe Newell, co-founder of video game developer Valve. ""You're going to look like you have magic powers compared to everybody else."" The clip already has been viewed more than 2 million times on YouTube.

"President Barack Obama and other world leaders have decided to end Russia's role in the group of leading industrialized nations, the White House said Monday. The move to suspend Russia's membership in the G8 is the latest direct response from major countries allied against Russia's annexation of Crimea. ""International law prohibits the acquisition of part or all of another state's territory through coercion or force,"" the statement said. ""To do so violates the principles upon which the international system is built.  We condemn the illegal referendum held in Crimea in violation of Ukraine's constitution. ""We also strongly condemn Russia's illegal attempt to annex Crimea in contravention of international law and specific international obligations."" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier in the day that being kicked out of G8 would be no big deal. ""G8 is an informal organization that does not give out any membership cards and, by its definition, cannot remove anyone,"" he said during a news conference. "" All the economic and financial questions are decided in G20, and G8 has the purpose of existence as the forum of dialogue between the leading Western countries and Russia."" Lavrov added that Russia was ""not attached to this format and we don't see a great misfortune if it will not gather. Maybe, for a year or two, it will be an experiment for us to see how we live without it."" Ukraine orders Crimea troop withdrawal . In a nod to political and economic reforms, the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and Italy added Russia to their group in 1998 -- transforming it from the G7 to the G8. An aide to British Prime Minister David Cameron confirmed to CNN that a group summit initially planned for June in Sochi, Russia, where the Winter Olympics were just held, is now off. The United States and its allies in Europe are ""united in imposing a cost on Russia for its actions so far,"" Obama said earlier in the Netherlands where he attended a nuclear security summit with other world leaders. Western powers have imposed sanctions and other penalties against specific people in Russia close to President Vladimir Putin. A senior Obama administration official, not speaking for full attribution, said Obama and other leaders agreed that further steps to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin could include sanctions on energy, banking and defense sectors -- all areas where Europe is deeply engaged economically with Russia. Those additional sanctions could be prompted if Russia further escalates its incursion into Ukraine, which the official defined as sending troops beyond Crimea into the southern or eastern parts of the country. Violence in the contested peninsula could also trigger further sanctions. While the official said further penetration of Ukraine by Russian troops remains the most immediate source of concern for the United States, other potential land grabs also worry the United States and its allies. NATO has expressed concern Russia could attempt to reclaim a region of Moldova with Russian sympathies. Can Obama's European trip re-assert U.S. global leadership? Obama has said a military incursion in Ukraine is off the table, and his advisers are hesitant to even frame the crisis in Ukraine as a bad '80s flashback -- Obama in one corner, Putin in the other. It's not ""Rocky IV,"" as Secretary of State John Kerry said. White House officials don't care to publicly muse about Putin's intentions. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said the Russian President's actions speak for themselves. The White House emphasis throughout the Russian occupation of Crimea has been ""de-escalation."" Asked whether the United States will provide military aid to Ukraine's woefully underfunded armed forces, administration officials cautioned that such assistance could inflame tensions. ""Our focus has been and remains on the economic and diplomatic instruments at this point,"" Rice said. ""Our interest is not in seeing the situation escalate and devolve into hot conflict."" Lavrov met with Kerry on Monday and said Russia's action in Crimea was necessary. ""It was the necessity to protect Russians who live there and who lived there for centuries,"" he said in the news conference. ""And when our partners compare Crimea to Kosovo, because in Kosovo a lot of blood was shed then its independence was proclaimed. So we have a question then: Is it necessary for the blood to be shed in Crimea to agree on the right of the people in Crimea for self-determination?"" While Democratic and Republican lawmakers in the United States are stepping up their calls to provide Ukraine with light arms and other military aid, administration officials have argued that sanctions put in place so far must be given time to take hold. With an estimated 20,000 Russian troops on Ukraine's border, the question is whether Obama's use of soft power will deter Putin. With little resistance, the Russian President could easily move into eastern Ukraine even as Obama seeks to isolate Moscow in meetings with European allies. It's a possibility not lost on senior administration officials. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican, argued the Russian leader is likely eying more opportunities in the coming days. ""(Putin) has put all the military units he would need to move into Ukraine on its eastern border and is doing exercises.

"London (CNN)The Sun, Britain's best-selling newspaper, may finally be ditching its topless Page 3 models after all these years. Last Friday's print edition of The Sun was the last to feature a bare-breasted woman, ending one of British journalism's most controversial traditions after 45 years, according to The Times, the tabloid's sister paper. The Sun refused to confirm the report on Tuesday. ""It's all speculation by people who don't work on the newspaper,"" a spokesman told CNN. ""We regularly mix it up, there's no hard and fast rule."" Despite The Sun's denial, the women featured on the third page of this week's editions have indeed covered up -- model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley posing in lingerie on Monday, and bikini-clad soap opera stars frolicking on the beach on Tuesday. An overhaul of the most infamous page in the country would be seen as the end of an era and a victory for critics who have derided Page 3 as a sexist anachronism in a society that has moved on since 1970, when Rupert Murdoch launched the feature shortly after purchasing the paper. Stephanie Rahn, a 20-year-old German supermodel, was the first to strip off for the paper in November 1970. Page 3 quickly became an institution and ""Page 3 girl"" entered the British vernacular. The topless pics were credited by some for giving a boost to The Sun's circulation figures, as well as launching the careers of a number of glamor models over the years, including Melinda Messenger, Samantha Fox and Katie Price. But Murdoch had come under increasing pressure since 2012, when the No More Page 3 campaign -- whose slogan is ""Boobs aren't News"" -- demanded that The Sun's editors kill the page. The group's online petition has attracted more than 217,000 signatures since its launch. Murdoch, the media tycoon who also owns 21st Century Fox, seemed to indicate that change could be on the way when he branded Page 3 ""old fashioned"" in a tweet last September. A spokeswoman for No More Page 3 expressed delight about the rumors but said The Sun needed to go even further. ""We're really pleased, it's a definite step in the right direction,"" Laura Ashton told CNN. ""It kind of depends a bit as well what they replace it with -- if it continues to be women in bikinis then it's still women being objectified, and we don't really think there's any place for that in a national newspaper, so the campaign will continue."" Ashton also had her own idea for what Page 3 could feature in the future: ""I'd love to see a celebration of women -- The Sun's in a really unique position here where they could turn things around after 45 years of giving us sexist images. They could celebrate women in sport, or some other way in which women contribute to society."" No More Page 3 was launched by Lucy-Ann Holmes in the summer of 2012 after the writer and actress noticed that the ""largest female image in The Sun newspaper was of a young woman showing her breasts for men, even though Jessica Ennis had won her tremendous Gold Medal in the London Olympics."" Although topless shots may no longer grace the paper's print edition, the group's campaign is far from over. The tradition lives on at The Sun's Page 3 website, and the Daily Star, another British tabloid, was still featuring naked models on page 3 as of Tuesday.","The Times reports that The Sun is dropping topless Page 3 models after 45 years .

"(CNN)The arduous search for a missing technology executive and five others feared dead after a suspicious fire destroyed a mansion in Annapolis, Maryland, could take days, fire officials said Tuesday. The 16,000-square-foot waterfront house belonged to executive Don Pyle, chief operating officer for ScienceLogic, company spokesman Antonio Piraino said. Pyle was believed to have been at home with his wife, Sandy, and four grandchildren. The sheer size of the structure and the fact that three-fourths of the building had collapsed into the basement, with piles of deep-seeded debris still smoldering, compounded the search, said Anne Arundel County Fire Capt. Robert Howarth, who is leading the investigation along with a team from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. ""Your looking at five standard houses put together,"" he said. ""This is more of commercial fire than it is a residential fire. There are a lot of businesses that aren't 16,000 square feet. That adds to it."" Pyle had not been heard from on Monday, and his colleagues at ScienceLogic were ""hoping for a miracle,"" CNN affiliate WJLA-TV in Washington reported. By midday Tuesday, fire officials had not been able to search the still-burning ruins, Howarth said. Heavy equipment is being moved in over the next 12 hours to aid in the search for victims and clues -- a process that could take days. ""We have some very unique challenges with this house,"" Howarth said. ""The construction of the house contained a lot of very heavy materials. We're looking at some steel beams that weigh in the area of 7 tons."" When the first firefighters arrived on the scene early Monday, they received conflicting reports about whether the family may have been out of town. But after interviews with relatives, it was determined that six members of the family were not accounted for, Anne Arundel County fire officials said. ""We still do not have 100% proof that they're in this house,"" Howarth said. Fire officials said they were alerted to the fire about 3:30 a.m. Monday. About 80 firefighters responded. The ATF national response team responded because the fire was deemed suspicious, Howarth said. The burned-out home is being treated as a crime scene until investigators figure out the cause, he said. The Anne Arundel County Fire Department said crews had difficulty knocking down the blaze because the house is secluded, apparently with no fire hydrants on the scene. Photos the fire department posted on Twitter showed hoses stretched for long distances. Capt. Russ Davies, Anne Arundel County fire spokesman, said it took hours for fire department tanker trucks and a fire boat on an adjacent creek to bring the fire under control. Pyle's company bio described him as a industry veteran who has held multiple CEO positions,  with more than 25 years' experience in information technology infrastructure software and hardware management. Pyle told The Washington Post last year that after holding positions in a family business he decided to look for an ""industry that was in its infancy and something that would have growth potential."" He started in a sales position in a firm that connected computers over transmission lines, and later sold both hardware and software components for the Internet. Pyle told the newspaper he eventually moved from sales to sales management to general management positions. In 1992, the company went public and was sold to Cisco Systems five years later for $4.2 billion, according to the Post. CNN's  Ralph Ellis, Shimon Prokupecz and Lindy Royce contributed to this report .","Fire destroyed a 16,000-square-foot mansion, a fire official says .

"(CNN)In his State of the Union address, President Obama proposed making community college tuition free for two years to boost college graduation rates and lift more people into the middle class. Unfortunately, his plan doesn't make the grade. The proposal would not only pile up more debt by further subsidizing runaway college costs, it would also perilously undercut the emergence of more innovative educational programs designed to help students succeed in the workforce. Offering only a lukewarm pathway to the job market, community colleges are incapable of fulfilling the President's lofty ambitions. Although there are some high-performing community colleges and stellar stories of success for certain students, the overall picture of success at two-year community colleges is dismal. According to the Community College Research Center at Teachers College, Columbia University, only 22% of students graduate within three years, and 28% graduate within four. More telling, 80% of students say they want a bachelor's degree or higher, and yet only 20% of these students transfer to a four-year institution within five years. Even for those who earn a community college degree, it often isn't as useful as other options. Thanks to credential inflation, pursuing a professional certification — which more clearly indicates a person's skills than a degree — often pays off better than an associate's degree, according to Census Bureau data. The conversation around making community college free also masks a larger problem, which is that community colleges are already heavily subsidized and far less affordable than commonly believed. At $3,300, community college tuition is well under the $5,730 currently available in Pell Grant aid to low-income students. But the expenditure per student at a community college — the true cost of the education — is far higher, about four times more at $13,000 per student. That means that more than 60% of the cost of community college isn't paid for through tuition, but through various forms of government aid at the federal, state and local levels. As a result, even if the President's plan passed, it wouldn't help the large number of already-overcrowded community colleges that have waiting lists numbering in the thousands. Tuition is only a small part of the funding needed to educate additional students. What's more, because of the limited productivity gains possible in the community college model, those costs will continue to rise, which means that tuition will, too. The proposal's $60 billion price over 10 years is likely to grow with only a questionable return on the investment. Opinion: Two years of free community college makes sense . The larger question the proposal misses is not how to allow students to afford college, but how to make college affordable. There's a huge distinction. The focus should be to make postsecondary education less costly and of better quality, such that the question of how to afford it becomes manageable. The President's proposal merely charges education, in the form of debt for future generations of taxpayers, rather than changes it. Instead we need to encourage students to seek innovative offerings that are lower cost and improve the quality and accessibility of higher education. Such options are emerging. Patten University offers a new online, competency-based program that charges undergraduate tuition of $350 per month, or $1,316 per term. Tuition includes access to as many courses as one can complete and all the ebooks and course materials needed, and Patten receives no government funding. Another online, competency-based program, Southern New Hampshire's College for America, charges annual tuition of $2,500. Rather than supporting innovative options like Patten and Southern New Hampshire, the President's plan would nudge students toward a community college sector that is incapable of repositioning its model around student success and fuel rising college costs. 5 ways community colleges are fixing higher education . If enacted, the President's proposal would be unlikely to achieve its ultimate aims and would exacerbate a larger problem lurking behind college financing. Although the plan amounts to little more than political posturing given the current congressional makeup, it will negatively influence the political conversation around higher education in the years ahead. By supporting free community college, President Obama is merely kicking the can down the road for future generations to confront. We need a better strategy for skills training overall before we go further down the track of subsidizing students to attend community college only to emerge with little to show for it.","In his SOTU, President Obama proposed making community college tuition free for two years .

"Washington (CNN)The unraveling security situation in Yemen -- the same country President Barack Obama cited as a model for his fight against ISIS -- could throw the President's counterterror message into question ahead of Tuesday's State of the Union address. In Sanaa on Tuesday, the presidential palace was overrun by Shiite Houthi rebels, a situation the country's minister of information described as the ""completion of a coup."" That's a problem for the United States, which has relied on the government in Yemen as an ally in  battling the al Qaeda affiliate that's based there. A power vacuum could benefit al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the terrorist offshoot that U.S. officials consider the most dangerous branch of the global jihadi network. Obama himself cited the U.S.-Yemen partnership when he announced in September he was going after ISIS terrorists in Iraq and Syria. Explaining why he was ruling out sending American troops to fight ISIS, Obama said he was modeling his strategy after what he said were successful efforts in Yemen and Somalia to partner with governments to go after terrorists. ""This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines, is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years,"" Obama said on September 10. ""It is consistent with the approach I outlined earlier this year:  to use force against anyone who threatens America's core interests, but to mobilize partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international order."" What that strategy relied on, however, was a strong partnership between the United States and the existing government in Yemen, led by President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. Hadi reorganized Yemen's military to better go after AQAP, a strategy that worked for a time. But the plan was waylaid when resources were diverted to battle the militant Houthis, a Shiite group who say they feel marginalized in the majority Sunni country. Republicans have seized upon the latest news from Yemen to illustrate their opposition to Obama's terrorism strategy. Sen. John McCain, now the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, tweeted ""The 'success story' of Yemen continues to unfold"" on Tuesday, followed by a link to a news report about the violence there. When pressed by CNN in September whether U.S. efforts in Yemen could be described as a ""success,"" the White House said the strategy there has worked. Yemen is ""a place where the American counterterrorism strategy that has been put in place by President Obama has succeeded in degrading the threat that those organizations pose to the United States,"" press secretary Josh Earnest said. ""We intend to implement an analogous strategy against ISIL."" During Tuesday's State of the Union, Obama will ""talk broadly about our counterterrorism strategy as part of our national security strategy, and as part of our way to make sure American principles are held up throughout the world,"" according to White House spokesman Eric Schultz. A senior administration official said Obama was being updated on the situation in Yemen by his national security team. ""We strongly condemn the violence and those stoking it in an effort to disrupt Yemen's political transition. We will continue to support efforts to bring about a peaceful solution,"" the official said.","President Obama had cited Yemen as a success story in fight against terrorists .

"The detainee hunger strike at Guantanamo Bay is entering its third month. Official reports say 100 of the detainees remaining at the detention camp are refusing food; lawyers for the detainees say the number is closer to 130. Twenty-three are being force-fed through nasal feeding tubes and at least 40 additional medical personnel have been flown to the base to help the overwhelmed staff care for those protesting their detention. Last week, President Obama reaffirmed his position that the detention camp at Guantanamo needs to be closed and that keeping detainees there without charge indefinitely ""is contrary to who we are, it is contrary to our interests, and it needs to stop."" Closing Guantanamo was one of Obama's key 2008 campaign promises. Five years later, the prison complex is populated with 166 detainees, 86 of whom have been approved for transfer to other countries, and is being considered for a $200 million renovation. Opinion: Why has Obama abandoned his Guantanamo pledge? Nearly 70% of the almost 800 detainees who have been held at Guantanamo were released by the Bush administration. Since then, some U.S. officials have become increasingly worried about former detainees joining militant groups. A key reason Guantanamo remains open is the fear that released inmates would mount terrorist attacks against the United States, its interests and its allies. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, for instance, last year called Guantanamo detainees ""crazy bastards that want to kill us all"". This view appears to be substantiated by government reports claiming many released inmates go on to join terrorist groups. Last year the U.S. Director of National Intelligence issued an ""unclassified summary"" estimating that the number of released detainees confirmed (15.9 percent) or suspected (12.0 percent) of joining militant groups was 27.9 percent. It is impossible to assess the validity of the government's assertion that more than a quarter of former Guantanamo detainees are confirmed or suspected to have joined a militant group because the government has not publicly released the names of former detainees who have ""returned to the battlefield"" since April 2009. The New America Foundation analyzed Pentagon reports, news stories, and other publicly available documents to create a list of former detainees who have either joined or are suspected of joining militant groups since their release. The list is available here. Of the 603 former detainees who have been transferred out of the prison camp, we identified only 17 individuals (2.8 percent) who are confirmed to be engaging in terrorist or insurgent activities against the United States or its citizens, while there are 21 individuals (3.5 percent) who are suspected of engaging in such activities. We also identified 15 former detainees who are confirmed or are suspected of militant attacks against non-U.S. targets (2.5 percent). For the purposes of our study, for a former detainee to be considered ""confirmed"" that he had joined a militant group, there had to be a preponderance of information claiming he was directly involved in terrorist or insurgent activities. For those ""suspected"" of such acts, there were plausible but unverified accounts about their involvement in such activities. Released prisoners who simply made anti-American statements or propaganda were not considered to be confirmed or suspected to be part of a militant group. While it is possible there are some former detainees participating in terrorist and insurgent activities who have not been identified publicly, we are confident that our numbers are reasonably accurate because groups like al-Qaeda and the Taliban are eager to trumpet the identities of released Guantanamo detainees who join their ranks and the media is also quick to highlight such stories. Based on the public record, even if you combine all the released Guantanamo prisoners who are confirmed or suspected to have taken part in any form of militant activity anywhere in the world, the total comes to 53, or 8.8%, which is much lower than the 27% being cited by the U.S. intelligence community. This 8.8% rate is also far smaller than the recidivism rate of criminals in the United States, which currently stands around 67.5%, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Interestingly, all but one of these former Guantanamo detainees who joined militant groups were released under the Bush administration. Under Obama, comprehensive threat assessments have been used to determine a detainee's eligibility for release, which has contributed to the fact that of the 72 prisoners released under Obama we were only able to find one who had joined a militant group after his release. Still, even if the number of Guantanamo prisoners who have ""returned to the battlefield"" is quite small, they are certainly dangerous. Take Said Ali al-Shiri, who co-founded Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in 2009. Transferred to Saudi Arabia in November 2007 during the George W. Bush administration, al-Shiri completed the kingdom's rehabilitation program and promptly headed to Yemen, where he became AQAP's deputy commander. Another example is Abdullah Ghulam Rasoul, who has emerged as a senior Taliban commander. Rasoul was also transferred from Guantanamo to Afghanistan in 2007 by the Bush administration and rejoined the Taliban shortly after the Afghan government released him from custody. In 2009, after the Yemen-based AQAP claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing of a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day, Obama issued a moratorium on all detainee transfers to Yemen. Of the 86 detainees currently approved for transfer out of Guantanamo, 56 are from Yemen. Congress then passed, and Obama signed, the Defense Authorization Act of 2011 which barred the use of government funds to transfer detainees into the United States or into the custody of other countries unless certain security concerns, like maintaining effective control over the detention facility housing the detainees, could be met. So far, it has been close to impossible for countries in the Middle East and South Asia, where most of the remaining detainees are from, to meet the standards set in this legislation. Yet the fact remains that 86 of the prisoners in Guantanamo were cleared for release three years ago following a year-long investigation of their cases by an interagency task force of officials at the Department of Justice, Pentagon, State Department and the Department of Homeland Security. These detainees, some now on hunger strike, have good reason to despair that they will remain in Guantanamo forever. Their cases have been exhaustively investigated. They have found to be guilty of nothing, yet they are being held indefinitely. Indefinite detention without charge is a policy that we usually associate with dictatorships, not democracies. Add to this the facts that less than 3% of the detainees at Guantanamo can be confirmed by the public record to have engaged in anti-American terrorism or insurgent actions following their release and those 17 detainees were all released before the intensive review of the cases of the remaining prisoners at Guantanamo began under the Obama administration in 2009. And so the Guantanamo prisoners who have been cleared for release remain in seemingly perpetual custody, not because they've been charged or because the rate of former detainees joining militant groups is at all high, but because Washington politics has effectively ensured that there is nowhere else for them to go. For these prisoners, attempting to starve themselves to death is an almost rational response to their bleak future. It's a story that Kafka might have written. Unfortunately, this one is true.","Peter Bergen: Washington talks of Guantanamo prisoners as major threat .

"(CNN)Despite a shared passion for food, we come from very different backgrounds. To look at us, you might not think we have much in common; one of us is a veteran Marine from New Orleans, the other a tattooed New Yorker with Mexican roots. But together these different perspectives strengthen our shared work both as chefs and as advocates. That's why last summer, when we were offered a chance to join the international relief and development organization Oxfam on a trip to Haiti as part of its GROW campaign, we jumped at the opportunity. GROW is Oxfam's global campaign to shift how our food is grown, sold and distributed by promoting smarter investment in sustainable agriculture models that will ensure everyone has enough to eat now and in the future. Oxfam invited us to Haiti to meet some of the Haitian farmers and chefs who are planting seeds of hope in a country that has faced more obstacles than any community should rightly be expected to overcome. Oxfam hoped we could  learn about the inspiring work being done in Haiti and share our own experience with sustainable food systems. You don't often hear stories of hope from Haiti. In the rare moments when news from the country makes its way to the United States, it's almost always about crisis. The challenges Haiti faces were obvious when we visited one of the largest remaining camps for people who are still -- five years later -- displaced as a result of earthquakes that devastated the country in 2010. Extreme levels of poverty and hunger and a lack of economic opportunity are all ongoing and serious issues. But during our short visit, we saw a different Haiti. Almost everywhere we went, we met problem-solvers who were innovative, creative and full of hope. They are working to build a stronger Haiti that can prosper and thrive. Oxfam is working in Haiti to empower farmers with tools and sustainable models of production that will help them build thriving farms and businesses that feed their communities. It also advocates for changes to policies that make it more difficult for Haitian farmers to thrive. We saw the inspiration in the eyes of women farmers who were beginning to chart their own course for the first time, reaping the benefits from the System of Rice Intensification, a groundbreaking way to grow rice that improves the quality of harvests and yields more rice while using less water, fertilizer, and other expensive inputs. We felt the ingenuity of the lush urban gardens that seemed to have sprouted up from nowhere in places previously destroyed by the earthquake. We cooked jambalaya with produce bought from those gritty urban farmers, most of whom had lost spouses, siblings or parents in the earthquake. The gardens offer the prospect of a new way to earn a living -- growing fresh, healthy food for their community. We tasted the hope in the delicious meals we shared with young chefs who had just graduated from Haiti's Ecole Hoteliere -- their ambition and optimism the same as any chef you'd meet in New York or New Orleans or Paris. We cooked for them and ate the local dishes they prepared. Their food showcased a rich culinary tradition comparable to any food capital in the world. We danced and sang late into the night at the Carnaval des Fleurs until our ears rang and our throats were hoarse. The innovation, ingenuity and hope we saw can create the foundations of a Haiti known for its food, culture and beauty rather than its poverty.  This was the constant theme we heard throughout our trip. Together, Haitian people can lift themselves up and build a better future for their country.

"His uncle Harry has promised the newest addition to the royal family that he will have ""fun"" -- and if a centuries old tradition is to be followed, it is an odds on certainty that horse racing will play a prominent role in young Prince George's future social life. A love of horses and thoroughbred racing is ingrained in the House of the Windsor, and Prince George's great grandmother Queen Elizabeth II is a leading owner with a string of top horses. ""She adores breeding racehorses,"" her racing manager John Warren told CNN. ""The British bloodstock industry is very lucky to have a patron such as the queen."" Fittingly, the 87-year-old's most notable achievement is winning the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot with Estimate, a four-year-old filly guided by 10-time British champion trainer Michael Stoute. Ridden by Ryan Moore, Estimate stormed to victory in the prestigious Group One race in June, the first time in its 207-year history that the British monarch had owned the winner. It added to her earlier triumphs in the English Classics, the 1,000 and 2,000 Guineas, The Oaks and St. Leger. Derby disappointments . Only the Epsom Derby eludes the queen, who saw her latest hope, Carlton House, come home third in 2011 after starting as favorite. ""She has inherited her father King George VI's love of the turf,"" said Nick Attenborough, spokesman for Great British Racing. The Queen Mother had a long, successful affiliation with steeplechase racing, where horses run longer distances than flat horses and have to negotiate jumps or hurdles. She died in 2002 at the age of 101, but during her lifetime had 449 winners in her royal colors. A top race at the Cheltenham Festival, the Queen Mother Champion Chase, is named in her honor. But like her daughter, success in the most prestigious event -- the Grand National, jump racing's equivalent of the Derby -- remained a dream for the Queen Mother. She was cruelly denied success in the 1956 edition when her horse Devon Loch, ridden by Dick Francis, led on the run-in at Aintree before falling to the turf unexpectedly. It was said the horse became distracted by the ear-shattering noise from a loyal crowd, desperate for a royal winner, and missed a stride. 'She strives to have winners' While racing is often called the ""Sport of Kings,"" in Britain ""Sport of Queens"" is just as appropriate. According to official records, Queen Victoria is said to have become so excited while watching a race at Ascot that she broke the window of the Royal Box in a rush to see the finish. Her great great grand daughter would surely never be guilty of such unseemly behavior, but as Estimate stormed clear in the final furlong at Royal  Ascot she could be seen with the broadest of smiles and maybe a hint of a tear. ""It's a special thrill to win this race for the Queen and it will have given her enormous pleasure,"" Stoute said at the time. ""She really loves this game and it's a great recreation for her. ""The Queen has such a love for her breeding program and this will have been a bigger thrill to win with a filly, rather than a colt. She told me it was a very big thrill and thanked everybody involved."" Her grandson Peter Phillips put it more succinctly.  ""This is her passion and her life and she's here every year and she strives to have winners,"" he was quoted as saying. That passion extends to a day-to-day involvement with her bloodstock and training operation. Formidable operation . ""She names all her own horses, I believe -- it gives her fantastic pleasure, planning the whole process,"" Attenborough said. It is a formidable operation with Royal studs at Sandringham and Wolferton in Norfolk and Polhampton in Berkshire, feeding into her training operation with about 25 horses racing each season. One of the stallions at Sandringham is former Derby winner Motivator, with the queen part of a syndicate using the horse for breeding. She will doubtless be hoping that one of his offspring can deliver her success at Epsom after the heartbreak of Carlton House's unlucky near miss two years ago. The last Royal winner of the Derby, Minoru back in 1909, was owned by King Edward VII, who was renowned for his love of racing and the good things in life. Edward also had success as the Prince of Wales with Diamond Jubilee in 1900, named in honor of his mother Queen Victoria's long reign. For the current British head of state it would represent a monumental achievement to emulate this feat, but it is not for lack of knowledge or trying. Well informed . ""She is a very well-informed and keen owner, probably the best-informed owner in the country,""  said leading trainer Andrew Balding, who has looked after a number of the queen's horses, and knows he has to keep them in peak condition. The Queen's keenness extends to low-key visits in a private capacity to racetracks such as Newbury, which is in the Royal County of Berkshire, to check on the progress of her horses. ""Most of the crowd would be unaware she is there, walking around the paddock, possibly wearing a head scarf,"" revealed Attenborough, whose organization is responsible for promoting horse racing in Britain. While Queen Elizabeth will not hand over the reins of her racing operation anytime soon, Attenborough is confident that she will find a suitable successor. ""They are a family that understands traditional values and understand the value of succession,"" he said. ""It can be traced back to Queen Anne's day."" Queen Anne designated an area of land near Windsor to equestrian pursuits in 1711, and it later became Royal Ascot. The Queen Anne Stakes, a Group One race that takes place every year at Royal Ascot, is named after the monarch who was so influential in the history of thoroughbred racing. Attenborough, and the whole of the UK racing industry in the UK, are hoping that the latest edition to the Royal family -- Prince George of Cambridge -- will be just as keen. Royal patronage . They sent a special gift of a teddy bear, dressed in the queen's racing silks, to the maternity wing of the London hospital where he was born in July. Watch: Pictures of Prince George released . For now, Attenborough is delighted to have the queen as a figurehead to their sport, particularly as it is now competing for audiences with counter attractions such as the English Premier League and team sports like rugby and cricket. ""Fantastic for us as she has to be the most high-profile figure in Great Britain with a standing all round the world and it is hard for any country in the world to have a more prominent figurehead in their sport,"" he said. Her star horse Estimate will likely return to Ascot on October 19 for the grand finale of the British flat racing season,  the QIPCO British Champions Day, looking to repeat the earlier success on a course on which she has never been beaten, in the Long Distance Cup. Estimate will likely face stiff competition from horses owned by other royal families, with the rulers of the Gulf states, notably Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, whose powerful Godolphin operation has been a major force in British racing for over 20 years. Attenborough believes the royal connections, with long standing owner breeders like the Aga Khan and the queen now competing against relative new entrants such as Sheikh Mohammed, can only serve to  maintain interest in sport of the turf in the 21st century. ""Their involvement is a fantastic boost for British and European racing,"" he said. Meanwhile, Britain's monarch, despite her 87 years, shows no signs of slowing up in her relentless pursuit of thoroughbred perfection.","The British royal family are avid followers of horse racing .

"For Li Na, it was no big deal. For Flavia Pennetta, it was one of the most important victories of her tennis career.

I have to go for winners,"" Pennetta said of Radwanska, who she beat in Dubai in February before losing to eventual champion Venus Williams in the quarterfinals. ""But I can't rush too much, because she's a wall. I mean, I have to make seven times the winners against her. But I played really well against her in Dubai, so I hope to play the same way this time."" Li, the top seed in the Californian desert tournament in the absence of Serena Williams, shrugged off her defeat -- having improved on her last tournament outing, which ended in the second round in Qatar last month. ""It's not bad. It's not like I lost my first match,"" China's first grand slam singles champion said. ""At least I had a few matches in Indian Wells, and making the semifinals isn't bad, and it's not like I lost to a bad player. She was playing really well. ""It's nothing to worry about. I have a couple things I want to improve for the next tournament."" Pennetta is seeking her 10th WTA Tour title, but her first in a top-tier tournament -- and she has lost 13 other finals. ""In the beginning of the week if you told me, 'You're going to make the final here,' I would have said, 'Mmmm, I don't think so!' So I'm really happy. I'm happy with my game,""  she said. Halep, meanwhile, will rise to fifth from seventh in the rankings despite her defeat -- the best by any woman player from her country. ""It's amazing for me. I'm not sad because I lost here. It happens. That's tennis. I have to understand I cannot win every match,"" said the 22-year-old. Australian Open semifinalist Radwanska will be seeking her 14th WTA title, and her first since last September's Korea Open. Meanwhile, men's No. 2 Novak Djokovic made it through to Saturday's semifinals at Indian Wells, where he won the 2008 and 2011 titles. The Serbian defeated France's Julien Benneteau 6-1 6-3 on Friday to set up a clash with American John Isner -- who beat him at the same stage two years ago. Big-serving Isner progressed by beating Latvia's Ernests Gulbis 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (7-3) on Friday. Roger Federer, a four-time champion in the Coachella Valley, will face Ukraine's  Alexandr Dolgopolov in Saturday's opening semi.","Flavia Pennetta shocks world No. 2 Li Na to reach final at Indian Wells .

"(CNN)Days after North Korea's most famous defector revealed some of the details in his accounts about life in prison camps weren't true, the country's government fired back Tuesday. Shin Dong-hyuk's ""admission of his lies goes to prove that everything told by those who claim to be 'defectors from the North' cannot be trusted,"" the state-run KCNA news agency said, citing a spokesman for North Korea's Association for Human Rights Studies. The government news agency called Shin a swindler who ""styled himself a 'survivor' in the 'concentration camp of political offenders' that does not exist in (North Korea) no more than a sheer lie and a fiction."" Shin's horrific descriptions of his time in a North Korean prison camp became a best-selling book, made him a key witness before the United Nations and grabbed headlines around the world. He was one of the most high-profile North Korean defectors, winning several human rights awards and inspiring a documentary as his biography about escaping from a total control zone called Camp 14 was translated into 27 languages. But over the weekend, the publisher of the book and its author said Shin -- who claims to have been born in and escaped from a North Korean prison camp -- had admitted several inaccuracies, including the length of time he spent in Camp 14. Shin still maintains he was severely tortured, but he's changed details about the dates and locations of what he says transpired. North Korea's statement Tuesday says that Shin's revelation shows that last year's human rights resolution that the U.N. General Assembly passed criticizing North Korea ""was no more than a false document cooked up on the basis of false 'testimonies' made by human scum."" Advocates have said any inaccuracies in Shin's story shouldn't undermine the staggering suffering he and other survivors of North Korea's prison camps have helped bring to light. And the chairman of the U.N. Commission of Inquiry into North Korea noted that Shin was one of hundreds of witnesses, adding that his testimony consisted of only two paragraphs in a 400-page report. ""It's a very small part of a very long story. And it really doesn't affect the credibility of the testimony,"" said Michael Kirby, chairman of the Commission of Inquiry into North Korea. CNN has not been able to reach Shin, who noted in a Facebook post apologizing for the inaccuracies in his story that ""these will be my final words and this will likely be my final post."" In an opinion article he wrote for CNN Digital last year, Shin noted that North Korea had made repeated personal attacks against him. ""The dictatorship in North Korea has never been honest or truthful for more than six decades it has been in existence,"" he wrote. North Korea has repeatedly denied Shin's claims and described testimony before the United Nations commission by him and others as ""slander."" In a video posted last year on a website that carries pro-Pyongyang propaganda, Shin's father denied that his son was ever in a prison camp. Shin said in response that the government had taken his father hostage. CNN's Judy Kwon contributed to this report.","North Korean state media slams defector for his ""admission of lies""

"Moscow (CNN)Ukraine's latest allegations that Russian troops have been deployed into Ukraine are ""complete rubbish,"" the Russian Defense Ministry said Tuesday. A day earlier, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Russian troops had crossed the border to support pro-Russian rebels. Ukraine and the West for months have accused Russia of supporting rebels in eastern Ukraine by sending in Russian troops, weapons and supplies. The United States and European countries have imposed economic sanctions on Russia over its involvement in Ukraine, while Russian officials have frequently denied claims their military has sent forces to bolster the rebels. On Tuesday, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Monday's allegations were designed to attract sympathy and investment for Ukraine at this week's gathering of political and business leaders in Davos, Switzerland. Yatsenyuk, according to Ukraine's state-run media, said Monday that his country's military ""confirmed the fact military personnel and equipment have been transferred from Russia to Ukraine."" ""Tanks, GRAD multiple rocket systems, BUK and SMERCH systems, radio electronic intelligence systems are not sold at local Donetsk street markets. Only the Russian army and Defense Ministry have them,"" Yatsenyuk said. The prime minister's spokeswoman, Olga Lappo, confirmed to CNN the quotes attributed to Yatsenyuk are accurate. Unrest in Ukraine began with protests in the country's capital last year after pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych, favoring closer ties to Russia, dropped plans to sign a political and economic agreement with the European Union. After months of protests and days of deadly clashes between demonstrators and security personnel in Kiev, Parliament ousted Yanukovych in February. Weeks later, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula. In April, violence broke out in two Ukrainian regions that border Russia -- Donetsk and Luhansk -- as separatist leaders declared independence from the government in Kiev. Pro-Russian separatists have claimed control of parts of Donetsk and Luhansk since the spring, despite a push by Ukrainian forces to defeat them. From mid-April to September 16 alone, at least 3,500 people were killed and at least 8,100 others were wounded in the conflict, according to the United Nations. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Russian Defense Ministry spokesman: Allegations designed to attract sympathy .

"(CNN)It's bespoke, beautifully formed, and changing the face of transport in Ghana. The bamboo bicycle is gaining traction in the country and one organization is riding this popularity wave to increase youth employment in the process. Booomers International is a social enterprise training rural Ghanaian communities in the art of bamboo bicycle manufacture to provide an economic freedom many of them have never experienced. ""We were looking at how we can engage the youth in the right areas into a meaningful venture,"" says company founder and CEO Kwabena Danso, who last year launched Booomers as a subsidiary enterprise of a development organization called Yonso project. ""[I've been] engaging them in the bamboo bicycle business."" Top gear . Bicycles made from bamboo have been around for more than a century but demand has only increased in recent years, in part due to the reintroduction of the concept by renowned bicycle designer Craig Calfee in 1995. Calfee went on to form Bamboosero, a Californian company dedicated to increasing the uptake of bamboo bicycles, particularly in developing countries, and today a number of companies across Africa are seizing the opportunity to make use of this abundant, natural resource to create a boom in bicycling. It's tensile strength and environmental sustainability make bamboo a highly desirable material. ""We do bamboo bicycles, bamboo bicycle stands and bicycle baskets for now,"" says Danso and their biking portfolio includes road, city, and mountain bikes in both male and female versions. ""Each bike is purely handmade...once you get your bike nobody else in the world has it."" Whilst there are bikes being crafted by other manufactures in Ghana, at the root of Booomers lies not only innovative design but a social conscience with climate change mitigation and rural poverty alleviation among their primary goals. Danso takes his rural youth teams through the entire manufacturing process -- from the harvesting of bamboo through to the final assembly of bespoke bicycles -- to ensure they're equipped with a diverse skill set. Some apprentices have had the pleasure of being trained by Calfee himself. ""We managed to get him to come down to train people,"" says Danso. Overcoming hurdles . Danso knows the challenges of manufacturing in rural Ghana well, including low capital, high production costs and unreliable electricity sources. ""Sometimes you come to work for two days and there is no light,"" Danso says. ""That's a really big problem to manufacturing in Africa."" But despite such limitations he is determined for his bicycles to travel the globe. ""In the next five years we want to conquer the world,"" he concludes. His wish is for Boomers to become a resource not only for bicycles, but also furniture, household items and even houses made of bamboo. ""We want to make this place the point where you come and get everything from bamboo."" More from African Start-Up .

"(CNN)Russia is rarely out of the headlines these days -- often for controversial reasons -- but does that mean it should be avoided by tourists? Since the collapse of the Soviet Union the country's status as a travel destination has grown steadily, with visitors drawn as much by the spectacular architecture and history of Moscow and St. Petersburg, as by the people and rich culture. However, recent events in Ukraine and the Crimean region have dealt a blow to this popularity, and could spell further trouble for Russia's tourism industry in 2015. Ironically, with the ruble taking a significant hit after the West slapped sanctions on Moscow following the annexation of Crimea and tensions in eastern Ukraine, there's seldom been a cheaper time to go for visitors from many countries. But will they go? And, crucially, should they? Indications so far suggest that 2015 will be another tough year for the Russian tourism industry. In the past, Russia's biggest source of visitors has been former Soviet states -- chiefly Ukraine. ""Ukraine is by far Russia's largest foreign market. Last year, tourism from that country into Russia plunged 43%,"" says Gillian Kennedy, an analyst for the London-based Travel & Tourism Intelligence Centre. It's a situation mirrored across other former Eastern Bloc countries. ""Traditionally, these visitors have traveled to Russia by road, which is a cheaper route than flying. But many roads to Russia from Eastern Europe go through Ukraine, which were shut down because of the conflict."" Beyond the region, tourism from Germany, the United Kingdom and United States experienced the most significant drops -- trends Kennedy says are likely to continue in coming years. ""The political situation between Russia and the EU remains difficult, which affects the economy of Russia in a negative way,"" says Helen Isaeva, managing director of Moscow-based destination management company Travel Russia. ""Needless to say that Russia is currently not a popular destination to travel to for many countries there."" Russia's rail and river voyages -- usually a strong draw for tourists -- have seen a decline in interest for 2015 excursions. According to Dmitry Esakov, director of sales and marketing for Moscow-based Volga Dream Cruises, bookings are down by up to 40%, partly due to a backlash against Russia's recent actions. ""Business from all Western countries has been affected in one way or the other,"" he says. ""Whereas six months ago that drop down may have been mainly driven by safety concerns, now they are mostly of a political and emotional nature."" There are no major Western travel advisories warning against visiting Russia beyond its border regions with Ukraine and regions that have previously been beset by troubles such as North Ossetia and Chechnya. The UK Foreign and Commonwealth website notes on Russia: ""Most visits are trouble free."" There's a more cautionary message from the U.S. State Department, which expresses concern about sporadic terrorist incidents, crime, harassment and demonstrations -- but there's no explicit warning to stay away. Felix Willeke is the marketing manager for Lernidee Erlebnisreisen, a German tour operator running the Tsar's Gold Trans-Siberian train between Moscow and Beijing. He says the Crimean crisis initially failed to dent business when it broke out in March. Since there were no travel warnings, few people canceled. ""Nevertheless, only a few new bookings came in after April for the rest of the season -- 2014 wasn't the best year, but still, it was better than our forecasts for 2015."" Willeke says his company still plans to run its full schedule of trans-Siberian trains, even though advance bookings are already down 30%. American tour operators have experienced similar booking trends. Annie Lucas is the co-owner of MIR Corporation, a U.S.-based company with long roots in Russia. At this time last year, Lucas thought that 2014 was looking to be a strong year for tourism to Russia. While events in Crimea didn't  lead to cancellations of trips already booked, there was a drop in future demand. She says those who pulled out did so because they ""were not thrilled with the notion of what was going on, and they made their decisions based on that rather than personal security issues."" Another barometer of falling demand is a cutback of 2015 tour departures by international operators. River cruise companies Viking Cruises and Uniworld are cutting capacity, while AmaWaterways has pulled out of Russia altogether. For AmaWaterways president Rudi Schreiner, it's partly a matter of economics and partly a matter of emotion. ""I'm the first to admit that this is both a personal and a business decision,"" he says. ""One of my concerns is what the economic situation will be in the future. ""If there's another conflict, or if trade sanctions are being imposed, we don't want to provide support to the regime."" Economic factors are also at play, Schreiner adds. ""With the rapid decline of the ruble, it's extremely costly to bring in goods to Russia,"" he says. ""So, we cannot guarantee that we can import the quality of goods and employ the right people to provide our passengers with the level of luxury they are used to."" Business travel has also been hit, although the news isn't all bad. Despite the recent downturn, Asia is emerging as a potential growth market for Russia in terms of both business and leisure travel. ""Asian countries tend to be less sensitive to the politics,"" says Travel Russia's Helen Isaeva. ""The same we hear from hoteliers: as the number of Europeans goes down, the number of Asians increases. As a result, our focus will move from the West to the East."" Outside of former Soviet states, China is Russia's largest and fastest-growing international inbound market. According to TTIC's Kennedy: ""Out of the top inbound countries, China was the only one to increase last year. As a result, Russia's national tourist agency has been making a strategic switch from West to East in the last few months."" In part, it's doing so by making visas easier to obtain, especially for Chinese groups heading to Crimea. Those groups are needed to fill the empty rooms left by the decline of Ukrainian vacationers, who previously made up 70% of Crimea's tourism market, according to Kennedy. Fueled by marketing efforts, easing of visa restrictions, and by the increased buying power of the yuan versus the ruble, business from China is expected to be up at least 10% in 2015. If Westerners do venture to Russia this year, they may discover that it's actually a good time to go. Although Viking Cruises has dry docked a portion of its Russian fleet, Richard Marnell, senior vice president of marketing, points out that ""2015 may actually be the best time to visit Russia. It certainly won't be as crowded, and prices are down due to shrinking demand and favorable exchange rates against the ruble."" Lernidee's Willeke agrees. ""What many do not see in this context is that there couldn't be a better time to visit. People are friendlier than ever before, the cost for restaurants, theater visits, souvenirs, yes, even hotel overnights, are significantly lower, plus ... no queuing at the St. Petersburg Hermitage.""

"(CNN)Ian Foster learned how to drive when he was six years old. Growing up on a farm in Northern Ireland, he would help his father herd cattle on a motorcycle, going up and down a mountain close to his parents' home. For the 50-year-old Hong Kong based architect, this sparked a lifelong motoring passion, and today he owns a collection of 40 classic cars and 130 motorcycles. Even though Foster's day job entails designing master-plans for cities and big resorts in China, he managed to devote enough time to his hobby to create a classic car museum, housed in former sheds of his parents' farmhouse in Northern Ireland. ""When I buy or when I'm looking at new cars, there's got to be something that I'm passionate about -- maybe the age of the car, maybe I remember a movie or when my father had it when I was a youngster. My collection is based on that, not necessarily a collectible car,"" he says. The most prized possession Foster acquired in his 25 years of collecting is a rare Belfast-made DeLorean DMC 12. It has a right hand drive, and Fosters says it is one of only 12 ever made. ""I can remember when I was 14, coming back from rugby practice and seeing the two test cars going through my local town, and always wanting to have one of those cars, thinking one day I'll have that car,"" he recalls. For the past three years, this architect with a serious penchant for automotive history has been the chairman of Classic Car Club Hong Kong, and has also been researching a book on the first 100 years of motoring in the city. ""I've been collecting photos, old stories, stepping through the decades,"" he says. There is however, one car that he would still like to add to his impressive collection: ""If I could afford it, I would like an Aston Martin from the 1990s.""","Architect Ian Foster has amassed a huge classic car collection .

"Hong Kong (CNN)China has strenuously denied it stole designs for America's next generation fighter jet, calling the accusations ""baseless."" The Foreign Ministry in Beijing responded Monday to the publication by German magazine Der Spiegel of new documents purportedly from NSA leaker Edward Snowden. The ministry's spokesperson Hong Lei told reporters Monday, that he wondered if his country's accusers could produce any evidence to support their claims. ""Cyber attacks are hard to trace back and are usually committed across borders. This complexity means that it is extremely difficult to identify the source of the attacks."" One document reveals that U.S. authorities believe China stole ""many terabytes of data"" related to its new state-of-the-art F-35 fighter jet, including detailed engine schematics and radar design. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the authenticity of the document. The Chinese are currently designing their own stealth fighter aircraft, the FC-31, which analysts have noted resembles the F-35. According to Reuben F. Johnson, a correspondent for IHS Jane's Defence Weekly, the FC-31 ""looks"" stealthy and its shape mimics that of the F-35 in some respects, but it's questionable whether it rivals its American counterpart from a performance and technological point of view. A data breach impacting defense contractor Lockheed Martin, the maker of the F-35, was originally reported in 2009.  The company told CNN at the time that to its knowledge, no highly classified information had been accessed. It declined to comment on the latest documents.

"Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama became the first president to use the words ""lesbian,"" ""bisexual"" and ""transgender"" in a State of the Union on Tuesday night, issuing an historic call for protections for individuals of any sexual orientation. ""As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we're threatened, which is why I've prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained,"" Obama said. ""That's why we defend free speech, and advocate for political prisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious minorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. We do these things not only because they're right, but because they make us safer."" Obama: 'Tonight, we turn the page' The remarks were a surprise, but not entirely unexpected for a president who has made GLBTQ rights a quiet but consistent focus of his tenure in office. Obama was also the first president to mention transgender individuals in any speech, and last year signed an executive order extending protection against discrimination in the workplace for gay and transgender workers in the federal government. And he also called gay marriage a ""civil right,"" in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to take up the issue once and for all. ""I've seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in states that 7-in-10 Americans call home,"" Obama said.","Obama is the first president to use the words ""lesbian,"" ""bisexual"" and ""transgender"" in a State of the Union .

"(CNN)A Polish prosecutor on Tuesday asked a regional court in Krakow to consider whether to extradite famed film director Roman Polanski to the United States, where he is wanted for having sex with a minor in the 1970s. ""Further procedures in this case will be made by the court in Krakow,"" the regional prosecutor's office in Krakow said in a statement Tuesday. Mateusz Martyniuk, a spokesman for the prosecutor, said the court could take several weeks to reach a decision. U.S. officials have repeatedly tried to bring Polanski back to the United States to face sentencing in the decades-old case. Polanski pleaded guilty in 1977 in California to having unlawful sex with Samantha Geimer, who was 13. Polanski was 43 at the time. He fled to Europe before he was sentenced. Geimer publicly forgave Polanski in 1997 and has called for the case to be dismissed. The director of ""The Pianist"" has both French and Polish citizenship, and he has said he intends to film a movie in Poland, his parents' homeland, this spring. Tuesday's move by the Krakow prosecutor comes three months after Polish authorities, having received a request from U.S. officials to arrest Polanski, questioned the director but allowed him to leave after the interview. At the time, a spokesman for the Polish prosecutor general's office said that authorities there didn't believe it was necessary to hold him while the United States sought to extradite him. U.S. attempts to extradite Polanski led to his arrest in Switzerland in 2009. But the Swiss ultimately rejected the American extradition request in 2010. Switzerland let him go because the United States did not supply all the legal records Switzerland requested, and because Polanski had a reasonable right to think he would not be arrested if he visited the country, Justice Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said at the time. Besides an Oscar win for ""The Pianist,"" Polanski also received Academy Award nominations for ""Tess"" and ""Chinatown."" CNN's Steve Almasy and Antonia Mortensen contributed to this report.","Roman Polanski fled the U.S. in 1970s after pleading guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old .

"(CNN)AirAsia Flight QZ8501 climbed rapidly, and then stalled, shortly before it crashed, a top Indonesian official said Tuesday. ""The plane ascended suddenly, with a speed that was above the normal speed limit, and then it went up,"" Transportation Minister Ignasius Jonan told reporters after he briefed lawmakers at a parliamentary hearing. ""Afterward, it (the plane) stalled."" At one point, the plane was climbing at a speed of 6,000 feet per minute, Jonan said. A fighter jet like the F/A-18 Super Hornet can climb as fast as 30,000 feet per minute. But commercial jets are designed to ascend at a much slower rate. The latest data show the AirAsia plane, an Airbus A320, was climbing at a rate twice as fast as it ""could and should do on its own,""  CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo said. ""I think that means there was a tremendous amount of winds and weather,"" she said. The commercial jet lost contact with air traffic controllers on December 28 as it flew from the Indonesian city of Surabaya toward Singapore with 162 people on board. Amid increasingly bad weather, one of the pilots had requested to deviate from the plane's planned route, AirAsia has said. And experts have speculated since Day One that storms might have played a role in the plane crash. If the plane was climbing at 6,000 feet per minute, Schiavo said, numerous alarms would have sounded in the cockpit. But if the aircraft got caught in an updraft, she said, the pilots might not have been aware at first of why it was climbing so quickly when they weren't inputting that into the controls. Picture your speedometer showing your car accelerating when your foot isn't pressing on the gas pedal. ""The pilots would have had control of the plane,"" she said, ""but may not have even realized what was occurring because of the confusing readings from the aircraft."" Last week, searchers recovered the plane's flight data and voice data recorders, which investigators hope will help them determine what happened aboard the doomed flight. Indonesian investigators say audio recordings from the plane's cockpit contain no sounds of gunfire or explosions, making it unlikely the plane was brought down by terrorism. While transportation officials focus on figuring out what happened, search teams are still looking for most of the bodies of the people who were on board the plane. More than three weeks after the crash, the remains of 53 people have been recovered, some of them still strapped into seats. Many of the rest could be in the wreckage of the fuselage, which searchers located last week at the bottom of the sea. Efforts to examine and get inside the wreckage have been hindered by high waves and strong currents.

"(CNN)It's starting to feel a little bit like Groundhog Day when it comes to parents under attack for letting their children do things on their own. The latest case? A Silver Spring, Maryland, couple is facing a neglect investigation for letting their 10-year-old son and 6-1/2-year-old daughter walk home from a playground, about a mile from their house, by themselves on a Saturday afternoon in late December. The story immediately brought to mind the South Carolina mom arrested for letting her 9-year-old daughter play at the park alone while she worked at a McDonald's and a Florida mom arrested after letting her 7-year-old walk to the park alone. Is it just me or have things suddenly gotten way out of hand when parents are being arrested -- or investigated -- for doing what was considered totally normal and appropriate just a few decades ago? I asked Danielle Meitiv, the mother at the center of this latest national story, about her parenting philosophy. ""The funny thing is, it's so funny to call it a philosophy,"" Meitiv said. Brutally Honest: When is it OK to leave your teen home alone overnight? ""In terms of crime, I lived in a more dangerous time period and my parents lived in a more dangerous time period ... so it just never occurred to me that this has to be a philosophy."" Growing up in Flushing, Queens, in New York, she would go to the bowling alley or library at a young age by herself. ""The idea that a parent would escort you somewhere, I mean my mother would have cracked up, 'What are you, nuts?' "" As Meitiv's kids got older, she and her husband grew more aware of the whole concept of helicopter parenting -- and the idea that kids had to be supervised all the time. She started looking up information and found the book ""Free-Range Kids"" by Lenore Skenazy and began following her online blog, too. ""So from that, I would say, 'Yeah, I'm a free-range parent,' "" she said. ""Again, to me, the idea is, what happened to just parenting?"" Skenazy, a New York mom, television host, speaker and author, was called the worst mother on the planet and meaner things than we could include in this article after she wrote a story in 2008 on why she let her 9-year-old son take the subway by himself. After the uproar about her parenting, she wrote the book and started a blog, and now hosts a show called ""World's Worst Mom?"" airing at 9 p.m. ET Thursdays on the Discovery Life Channel. Mom arrested for leaving 9-year-old alone at the park . Skenazy actually broke the story on Reason.com about the Meitivs being under investigation by Montgomery County's Child Protective Services after they let their children walk home from a playground by themselves. ""We've been encouraged in our society to do what I call worst-first thinking, which is come up with the worst-case scenario first and proceed as if it's likely to happen, and that's what happened with the Meitivs,""  Skenazy said. ""Someone sees two children alone, and they leap to 'Oh, my God, they're neglected. What if they're run over by a Mack truck? What if they're kidnapped? There are predators all around.' "" Crime rates are way down from when many of us were kids in the '70s; rape, murder, burglary and arson are all down, said Skenazy, so it's not exactly true to think today's world is scarier than when I walked four blocks to the candy store when I was in the first grade. ""And if we are going to say, 'Oh, my God, I would never let my kid walk outside; something bad could happen,' well, I hope you're saying that 'Oh, my God, I would never put my kid in the car, something bad could happen,' because the No. 1 way children die in America is as car passengers, and yet we seem to keep that 'danger' in perspective, but we can't keep the same perspective when it comes to letting our children walk outside,"" she added. The afternoon that thrust the Meitivs into the national spotlight was as normal as you can get. Alexander Meitiv and the kids were heading home after synagogue (Danielle was in New York for a family event) when they passed the playground the kids had been begging to go to for weeks. This playground was going to be ""the next evolution of their ranging,"" Meitiv said. She and her husband felt they were ready, and so he dropped them off at the playground and told them to return home in a little while. Florida mom arrested after letting 7-year-old walk to the park alone . About halfway on their walk home, the children were stopped by two police vehicles, Meitiv said. When officers asked whether they were lost or in trouble, the kids told them they were fine, that their parents knew where they were and that they are allowed to walk home by themselves, she said. The police drove the kids home to the Meitivs' house. Rafi Meitiv, who's 10, called his mother crying, ""Mommy, the police are here. I'm afraid they're going to arrest Daddy,"" she remembered him saying. Alexander Meitiv was not arrested, but a few hours later, someone from Child Protective Services arrived and said the family needed to agree not to let the children be unsupervised until the matter was resolved within the agency, or the children would be taken into the custody of Child Protective Services. After a number of calls with CPS, and after CPS allegedly interviewed the Meitivs' children without their knowledge and without a parent being present, they are still waiting to have an in-office meeting with the agency. Brutally Honest: Is it OK to let your children fail? ""This is no joke,"" said Danielle Meitiv. ""The threat that they can take my kids is real."" The Montgomery County Health and Human Services Department said it is bound by state confidentiality laws preventing it from commenting on a specific case. ""Like all Departments of Social Services in Maryland, Montgomery County Child Protective Services is required to respond to all calls from community members and law enforcement about possible neglect,"" the statement said. Most states don't have laws on the books regarding how old a child must be to be left alone. Maryland is one of the few that does, stating that children under 8 years old may not be left unattended in a house or car. There isn't anything stipulated within the law about kids being alone outside. This is not the first time the Meitivs have been approached by CPS. In October, a few days after Danielle Meitiv let the kids play at a playground around the block from their house and walk home by themselves, two CPS workers came to her door after they were contacted by someone mostly likely from the neighborhood, Meitiv said. That case was eventually closed. ""We have no problem with people looking out for our kids. That's actually what people always did, look out for each other,"" Meitiv said. ""It's the idea that looking out for them then becomes reporting them to the police and making it criminal ... that it becomes somehow this is neglect. My kids were playing at the park."" The story has gotten a ton of traction online, with many parents expressing outrage about another case of a parent under investigation for letting children do things on their own. ""The parents in the above referenced story have the right to raise their kids as they wish. I do not think it is a CPS issue,"" wrote Annette Lanteri, a lawyer and mom of two girls in Bayport, New York, in an email. ""I personally give them credit for allowing their kids to have freedom at such a young age."" 'Brutally Honest': Is it OK to spy on your kids? Cherylyn Harley LeBon, a mom of two, said that whether she decides to let her children walk to the park alone is ""simply her business,"" not her neighbors'. ""And if there is a bona fide question of neglect in my household, then Child Protective Services should be notified. Anything less than that is government overreach,"" said Harley LeBon, a writer, strategist and former senior counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Laura Beyer, a mom of two grown daughters, said she doesn't believe the parents were negligent in this case, because the children were ""obviously capable"" of simply walking to and from the park. ""My thought is if those of us who care for others would simply 'keep an eye on' children as we drive to and fro, they would be safe nonetheless,"" Beyer said. ""If you see a child walking and he or she is being approached by what seems to be a stranger, pull to the side of the road and ask if he or she is OK."" But some parents are asking questions about how young is too young to leave kids alone and how much one's community should play in that decision. Terry Greenwald, a father of three in Alaska,  said, ""In a small town where the parent feels their children are safe, I'd understand a parent allowing some freedom, at least more so than someone living in a larger city. ""The world is a dangerous place, though, and we all need to protect ourselves and our children, especially our children,"" said Greenwald. The Meitivs hope their story helps get the message out that parents today may too often overestimate the danger and underestimate their kids. ""Our children need the freedom to grow into the happy, healthy, confident adults we want them to be, so we should trust our kids more,"" Meitiv said.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN)Historic talks set to begin on Wednesday between the United States and Cuba could lead to ""re-established relations,"" but dealings between the two countries cannot be considered normalized until the U.S. trade embargo is fully lifted, a Cuban official said Tuesday. The official, a high-ranking member of Cuba's foreign ministry, spoke to CNN and a handful of other media on condition of anonymity. A U.S. delegation arriving in Havana on Wednesday will first discuss migration accords and then begin negotiations on repairing five decades of strained relations that are expected to lead with the restoration of embassies in Washington and Havana. The talks are set to conclude on Thursday. Most likely additional discussions would take place in Washington and Havana. The United States broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1961 over concerns that Fidel Castro's revolution was increasingly aligning itself with the United States' then-mortal enemy, the Soviet Union. Last month, Cuba and the United States agreed to exchange prisoners and engage in the first formal negotiations to restore diplomatic relations since the rupture that led to the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis and other fraught conflicts of the Cold War. Last week, President Barack Obama eased some sanctions, including many of the restrictions that prevented Americans from visiting the island. For the first time, Americans will be able to travel to Cuba by booking flights directly through U.S. airlines and will be permitted to use U.S. credit cards for transactions there. ""They will be welcome,"" the Cuban official said of the wave of Americans expected to soon take advantage of the relaxed regulations. But the Cuban foreign ministry official said while those steps are positive signs, they did not go far enough and Cuban officials would push for the lifting of all trade sanctions and the so-called ""wet foot, dry foot"" policy that allows Cubans who reach U.S. territory to stay in the country. A U.S. official who spoke on background Monday said only the U.S. Congress could change those laws. The U.S. official said the State Department negotiators, led by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson, will argue that caps on diplomats stationed in Havana should be lifted to increase staffing numbers, as should the restrictions currently placed on U.S. diplomats that forbid them traveling more than 25 miles from the interests section. Cubans should also have unfettered access to a future U.S. embassy, the official said. But the Cuban official said first Washington should abandon efforts to support the island's dissident community, which Cuban authorities say works with American officials to topple the island's single-party communist government. U.S. officials have said human rights concerns and efforts to strengthen Cuban civil society remain key U.S. policies in Cuba. The State Department is also carrying out a review that could lead to removing Cuba from the U.S. list of countries that sponsor state terrorism. The U.S. official said it was possible that embassies could be reopened before that review was complete. But the Cuban official said it would be contradictory to re-establish diplomatic relations without first removing Cuba from the terrorism list. Countries on the list face political and economic sanctions. In a twist worthy of a spy thriller, a Russian intelligence-gathering ship on Tuesday arrived in Havana, docking in plain view in the city's port. The Viktor Leonov, a Vishnya class intelligence ship, visited Cuba twice in 2014, apparently to conduct electronic eavesdropping on the United States. The county's state-run media made no mention of the ship's return Tuesday, but the Cuban official said any navy was welcome to dock on the island as long as it had ""peaceful intentions.""","U.S. delegation in Havana will begin negotiations on repairing five decades of strained relations .

"(CNN)Violent protests have erupted in parts of the world over the latest issue of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. While there have also been largely peaceful protests, authorities from Africa to the Middle East are seeing clashes in the streets -- and seeking ways to tamp down the uproar among Muslims furious over depictions of the Prophet Mohammed. The deadliest violence has been in Niger, where authorities report 10 people killed.  Churches and homes have been destroyed, the government said in a statement. AFP, the France-based news wire service, said police reported that 173 people have been injured; at least 45 churches have been ""set ablaze in the capital (Niamey) alone,"" and a ""Christian school and orphanage were also set alight."" Numerous sites were pillaged before being burned. Video from Niamey showed protesters waving Qurans and yelling ""God is great"" while tearing apart Bibles and throwing them onto the ground. A bar owned by people from France could also be seen burning. Three days of mourning began Monday, the government announced. In Karachi, Pakistan, police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters outside the French consulate. A Pakistani photographer for AFP was shot and wounded, the news agency reported. At least 200 protesters were involved in the violence, which broke out after Muslim religious parties called on supporters to condemn the cartoon following afternoon prayers, said Ahmed Chinoy, chief of Karachi's Citizen Police Liaison Committee. Images from the scene showed police in running street fights with demonstrators. Those protests came after Pakistan's parliament unanimously passed a resolution condemning the caricatures printed in Charlie Hebdo. In Algeria, clashes erupted between demonstrators and police as well. And in Jordan, ""the Muslim Brotherhood organized a crowd of 2,000 protesters who clashed with police in the capital of Amman as they moved toward the French Embassy,"" USA Today reported.  ""Police used batons to break up the gathering."" In Gaza, ""Some 200 radical Islamists tried to storm the French cultural centre in Gaza City on Monday, shouting slogans threatening the lives of staff over Charlie Hebdo cartoons,"" AFP reported, adding that the protesters chanted ""'Damnation upon France!' and waved black flags adopted by jihadists. ""Leave Gaza, you French, or we will slaughter you by cutting your throats,"" the protesters chanted, according to AFP. Palestinian police arrested dozens who tried to break into the French cultural center, the report said. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said activists in Gaza wore uniforms similar to those of ISIS militants. The paper quoted one protester, Abu Abdallah Makdissi, as saying, ""Today, we are telling France and world countries that while Islam orders us to respect all religions, it also orders us to punish and kill those who assault and offend Islam's Prophet Mohammed."" There have been large-scale peaceful protests reported in several African nations, including including Mali and Somalia, and parts of the Middle East including Lebanon. Thousands from Russia's North Caucasus gathered in Grozny, Chechnya, for a peaceful event called Love for the Prophet Mohammed, Russia's state-run TASS news agency said.  News reports estimated hundreds of thousands may have taken part. In Senegal and Mauritania, protesters torched French flags, the French news agency France24 reported. There were similar scenes in Iran, where protesters burned U.S. and Israeli flags. CNN's Sophia Saifi contributed to this report.","Violent protests in Niger leave 10 dead, churches and other sites torched .

"Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton has been meeting with advisers at her Chappaqua, New York home for strategy sessions about launching a 2016 presidential run, a Democratic source tells CNN. The meetings have taken place for part of the last month, according to the source, and have focused on the strategy, tactics and policy that would make a possible Clinton run in 2016 campaign successful. ""She has got a lot of depth in policy, but she is looking for new ideas,"" the source said. ""She is also being very thorough about the path to the nomination and the path to the presidency. There are a lot of strategy meetings with tactics focused on that."" Democrats attending some of these meetings -- which were first reported by the Washington Post on Tuesday -- include Joel Benenson, Jim Margolis and Robby Mook, according to the source, who noted that all three operatives had been selected to play major roles in the Clinton campaign. In the run up to what is now an all-but-certain 2016 announcement, Benenson has been tapped chief strategist for the Clinton campaign, according to reports from the Washington Post and Politico. The source said that specific title has not been solidified yet, but the Democratic pollster is playing a big role in this pre-campaign process. ""She [Clinton] likes him for more than just reading poll results,"" the source said, noting that he would play a larger role than campaign pollster. The Clinton pre-campaign has also selected Mook -- a veteran of Clinton's 2008 campaign -- as their campaign manger, according to the source, and Margolis -- a senior adviser to Obama's successful 2012 reelection bid -- as media adviser. Both selections have been expected by Democrats close to Clinton and been previously reported. John Podesta, a top White House adviser who is slated to leave the White House in early February, has also been named campaign chairman, the source said. Politico was first to report his top campaign slot. ""He will be the chairman and the issue right now is if everyone will report to him as the chairman,"" the source said. ""I don't think he will be a titular head. I think the issue is is he going to be in charge of the campaign with authority and the intention is that he will be very active."" Podesta, a former top aide in Bill Clinton's White House, joined the Obama White House in 2013 to help on major projects and negotiations. Recently he has since been blunt about the fact he planned to leave the administration in early 2015 to help a possible Clinton campaign. ""If she runs, as I hope she will, I will do whatever she asks me to do,"" Podesta said on the Charlie Rose Show in November. ""Right now she hasn't made a decision to run, so I am expecting to return to what I was doing before."" Clinton's meetings at her home in New York seemingly explain her month long absence from the speaking circuit and Twitter. The former secretary of state has gone over a month without a high-profile speaking gig, a dearth in events that is noticeable considering how many event Clinton headlined last year. Clinton will headline her first event in over a month on Wednesday in Winnipeg, Canada. Although some structural decisions have been made, the source said the Clinton camp has not solidified the overall architecture of the operation as well as heads of the communications, field and digital operations. ""There are these structural things to do and then, really I think once that is done, the thing she is going to end up spending a lot of time on is her plan and her message,"" the source said. Clinton's 2016 team, though early, is already shaping up to be a departure from the team that surrounded her in her during her failed 2008 presidential run. Instead, Clinton is pulling heavily from Democrats who successfully won Obama the White House twice. Republicans seeking to tie Clinton and Obama have welcomed that fact, arguing that by hiring former Obama advisers, Clinton is making their job easy. In a memo from America Rising, an anti-Clinton super PAC, Tim Miller, the group's executive director, said ""Clinton is signaling that she's not just from the same party as the President, but that she's an Obama Democrat, who will back his policies, pursue his agenda, and represent a Third Term of the Obama Administration."" Emails to the a Clinton spokesman about the meetings and hiring went unanswered.","Hillary Clinton is preparing for a likely 2016 run by regularly meeting with advisers in her New York home .

"Beijing (CNN)China's largest instant messaging service has apologized to nationalistic critics who blasted the popular app for ""showering"" the accounts of some of its 400 million users with the U.S. flag. WeChat users typing in the phrase ""civil rights"" last weekend noticed a cascade of Stars and Stripes raining down their screens, much to the chagrin of some Chinese customers, who said that no special icons appeared when patriotic Chinese terms were entered. ""When we entered words like National Day, China and the Red Flag with Five Stars, nothing happened,"" complained the Fujian provincial committee of the Communist Youth League in its official microblog Sunday night, after posting pictures of its experiments. ""WeChat, could you explain why?"" In an online statement, WeChat -- owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent -- clarified that its team had added the U.S. flag special feature in honor of the Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the United States on Monday and had meant for it to be seen only by users in the U.S. ""A system error had caused users in other regions to use this feature as well,"" read the statement, which also apologized for the ""misunderstanding."" The controversy over the Stars and Stripes comes as the Chinese government -- under an increasingly powerful and ideologically conservative President Xi Jinping -- continues to tighten its grip over the cyberspace and beyond. The country's top Internet regulator has shut down 133 public WeChat accounts for ""spreading distorted historical information"" about the ruling Communist Party, state media reported Tuesday. The same agency recently told the state-controlled People's Daily newspaper that China's six major web portals deleted more than 340 million pornographic or otherwise ""harmful"" posts last year as part of the government's ""cleaning up the Internet"" campaign. Earlier this week, the Communist leadership in Beijing ordered universities nationwide to fortify ideological control by ""studying and propagating Marxism,"" as well as ""cultivating and promoting the core values of socialism,"" according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. While many applauded the Communist Youth League's criticism of WeChat's flag feature, other Internet users called it narrow-minded. Referring to the attached screen grabs that unmistakably show an Apple device being used, one of the most liked comments under the post shot back: ""A Chinese Communist Youth League provincial committee using an American smartphone -- could you explain why?""","WeChat messaging app users typing in the phrase ""civil rights"" were inundated with U.S. flags .

"(CNN)Wild tigers in India appear to be staging a comeback in the battle against extinction, with the country's Environment Minister announcing a 30% increase in the endangered species' population since 2011. ""Our latest estimate today is that India has 70% of the world's tiger population and we have now 2,226 tigers presently in 47 tiger reserves [up from 1,706 in 2011] and this is a great achievement. It is a net increase of 30% over the last estimation,""  Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said in a statement Monday. Researchers involved in the study, the third of its kind carried out in India, say they used advanced technology to assess the population of the big cats. Debbie Banks, head of the Tiger Campaign at the Environmental Investigation Agency, which carries out extensive research on the illegal tiger trade, welcomed news of the study, saying she looked forward to seeing the full report when it releases in March. ""I think it has set India apart from some of the other tiger range countries. If you look at China, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, there's more emphasis on tigers in captivity, farming and valuing tigers for their body parts higher than the survival of tigers in the wild,"" she says to CNN. India's once-thriving tiger population has been severely affected by poaching, a reduction in prey, habitat destruction and conflict with villagers who may occupy the same area. Although preliminary results of the government's study are promising, Banks warns against complacency. ""While this is good news from India, I don't think anyone is sitting back and saying 'we've won.' The demand within China for skins to decorate homes and bones for tiger bone wine all continue. And so it's a constant battle."" A major challenge is also the sophistication of the tiger trade, where body parts of the animal are transported across unofficial borders, such as mountain passes. ""The criminals have changed their practice. And there's no evidence of any enforcement there,"" she says. A historical symbol of power and beauty in cultures such as India and China, the significance of the tiger goes beyond its aesthetics, Banks says. ""Tigers are major indicator of the health of the environment, certainly the health of the forest that they inhabit. But they are the water gods, if you like. They are indicators of how well we are doing to conserve forests that provide water for millions of people and mitigate climate change. ""There's an ecosystem reason to save wild tigers."" And if today's results are anything to go by, Banks says India appears to be leading that charge. ""India, despite all the problems it has with high human population in small areas, is totally setting the benchmark for wild tiger conservation.""","India's Environment Minister has announced a 30% increase in wild tigers in India since 2011 .

"(CNN)The black-clad, masked British ISIS terrorist who has taken center stage in the group's hostage videos appeared in a new video on Tuesday threatening the lives of two Japanese hostages, Kenji Goto Jogo and Haruna Yukawa. The terrorist explained that they would be executed in 72 hours if ISIS isn't paid $200 million. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe responded on Tuesday saying the treatment of the hostages was ""unacceptable."" ISIS had similarly demanded 100 million euros (roughly $132.5 million) in ransom for the release of James Foley, the American journalist who was killed by the terrorist group in Syria in August. Like the $200 million demand for the Japanese hostages, the Foley demand was never a serious negotiation effort as it far exceeded the amounts of money paid for hostages held by jihadist militant groups in the past, which typically have ranged up to several million dollars. But the demand does shine a light on two uncomfortable facts about ""Kidnap & Ransom,"" or K&R, the dark netherworld of professionals who work to negotiate between murderous groups such as ISIS and the terrified families whose loved ones have been kidnapped. It also includes their worried employers and Western governments such as France that will pay ransoms, and other governments, notably the United States and the United Kingdom, that will not. The first uncomfortable fact is that if you pay a ransom, a hostage is more likely to be released. The other is that every time a ransom is paid it increases the chance that other hostages will be taken to help fill the coffers of a terrorist group. According to an investigation by The New York Times, al Qaeda and its affiliates have netted at least $125 million in ransoms since 2008. That finding is similar to a 2012 U.S. Treasury estimate  that $120 million had been paid to terrorist organizations during the previous eight years. Much of this revenue reportedly comes from France. French media reported that the government had paid 20 million euros (about $28 million, reflecting last year's exchange rate) for the release of four employees of a French nuclear firm. They were held by an al Qaeda affiliate for three years in northern Niger and were released last year. The French government denied paying a ransom,  but The New York Times indicated -- based on reports from Le Monde and Agence France-Presse  -- that France did pay in that case and has paid out a total of some $58 million to al Qaeda or related groups. Opinion: Why countries should think about paying ransoms . Not surprisingly, the Times also found that of the 53 hostages known to have been taken by al Qaeda and its affiliates during the past five years, a third were French. The French government's purported policy of negotiating with militant groups for the release of kidnapped citizens does appear to work. Four French journalists -- Nicolas Henin, Pierre Torres, Edouard Elias and Didier François, who were kidnapped in Syria last year by ISIS -- were released near the Turkish border in April, blindfolded and with their hands bound. One of those hostages, Henin, had been held by ISIS alongside Foley.  Henin is free, and Foley is dead. These are the facts that policymakers must confront as they consider what to do about the other Western hostages still held by ISIS. So far, ISIS has executed a number of Western hostages, including American journalist Steven Sotloff, and U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig. ISIS continues to holds one American female aid worker. CNN is withholding her name. For the hostages held by ISIS, there is always the chance that their governments will mount a rescue operation as the United States did in Syria in July 2014 to try and rescue Foley and the other Americans. That mission failed because the hostages had been moved from a location they had been kept in for some months. There is also the possibility that hostages could escape, as American photographer Matthew Schrier did  last year when he managed to crawl out of a window of the prison where he was being held in in the Syrian city of Aleppo by an Islamist militant group. But such escapes are rare, and while successful rescue efforts do happen, they are fraught with risks for the hostages. Linda Norgrove, for instance, a British aid worker held by the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2010, was killed in a U.S. rescue operation, likely by a grenade that exploded near her. If there's not an escape or a successful rescue effort, Western governments whose citizens are held by ISIS have only the options of either a negotiation involving ransom or the real possibility that their hostages may be executed. This is the sobering choice that has faced President Barack Obama and his national security advisers and now faces the Japanese Prime Minister. Last year, Obama ordered a review of U.S. hostage policy, which is never to negotiate with terrorists. The review is reportedly supposed to examine issues such as ""family engagement, intelligence collection, and diplomatic engagement policies."" But that seems to be rather missing the point. The real issue is: Will a ransom be paid, or not? An area of possible wiggle room would be to leave the door open so that ransoms for Americans could be allowed to be paid -- not with U.S. government funds but with private donations. In such a case, the government would simply look the other way when private donations were used to free an American hostage, as paying money to a designated terrorist organization is a crime in the States. This is the least bad solution to a terrible quandary, which is if that if you don't pay the ransom the hostage dies, and if you do pay the ransom, you are helping a terrorist organization.","Peter Bergen, Emily Schneider: ISIS seeking $200 million for two Japanese hostages' freedom .

"(CNN)Brown University has sanctioned two fraternities for holding unregistered parties last fall that officials said facilitated sexual misconduct. The action by the Rhode Island university -- outlined in a letter signed by two of its vice presidents -- comes as the U.S. Department of Educations investigates whether dozens of colleges and universities throughout the nation illegally handled sexual violence and harassment complaints. Brown also announced a review of alcohol policy and social event regulations this spring, according to the letter. ""The measures we are taking this spring reflect our interest in preventing sexual assault by addressing the campus climate at Brown,"" said the letter distributed to the campus. ""All Brown community members need to be involved in preventing sexual violence, and all student organizations are expected to ensure that adequate security measures are in place to promote safe events and activities."" Brown said Sigma Chi fraternity has been sanctioned with probation and ""suspension of social and university privileges until fall 2016."" ""It cannot sponsor social events, has lost access to the chapter room, lounge, library, and basement, and is ineligible to conduct recruitment, rush, or initiation processes,"" the letter said. In October 2014, Sigma Chi hosted an unregistered party in the basement of its residence. One student reported ""non-consensual contact of a sexual nature that occurred as students were exiting the crowded basement"" when public safety officers broke up the party, the letter said. The student was not able to identify the person who touched her. Phi Kappa Psi was sanctioned with loss of university recognition for four years, including loss of housing, effective immediately. The fraternity held an unregistered party in October 2014 during which two students reported receiving an ""alcoholic drink that contained a date rape drug,"" according to the letter. The drug was identified as gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB). The fraternity was charged with ""creating an environment that facilitated inappropriate, potentially dangerous, and possibly criminal behavior by hosting a party where guests were served a drink that contained a date rape drug,"" the letter said. One student reported ""non-consensual sexual contact that did not happen within the fraternity's facility nor did it involve a member of the fraternity, but its occurrence was a result of the student's incapacitation,"" said the letter from Russell Carey, executive vice president for planning and policy, and Margaret Klawunn, vice president for campus life and student services. Brown said no individual member of either fraternity was charged with sexual misconduct. The fraternities did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment. A separate federal investigation of dozens of colleges and universities centers on Title IX, under which a school must ensure that students are not denied or limited in the ability to participate in or benefit from its educational programs or activities on the basis of sex.","Brown University sanctions Sigma Chi Phi and Kappa Psi for unregistered parties .

"On the Turkey-Syria border (CNN)Hayat Boumeddiene is today among Europe's most wanted women. The widow of Paris supermarket gunman Amedy Coulibaly, she is believed to have disappeared into Syria in the days leading up to the shootings in Paris. Since the attacks, security officials have been scrambling to trace her movements. But on January 2, a week before her name was internationally known, security camera footage shows that Boumeddiene and a male companion cleared customs with ease at Istanbul's secondary airport.

They were monitored for a couple of days, but after engaging in what was described as ""touristic"" activities, the surveillance stopped. Female terror suspect more radical than boyfriend? Following the Paris attacks, Turks officials alerted French authorities that they had already gathered some intelligence on Boumeddiene. The French provided the Turks with phone numbers that allowed them further to track her movements. Boumeddiene's last known location is the city of Sanliurfa, along the Turkey-Syria border. Sanliurfa has become a key hub for transit into Syria. The touristic city has seen its population swell due to the influx of refugees from Syria's civil war, and just about anyone can blend into the chaotic streets. From here, those seeking to enter Syria can find plenty of routes for the next leg of their journey. CNN spoke to two men in a town close to the border, both of whom are professional people smugglers. Over the last few months, the Turkish military has really cracked down on the practice, one said, his head wrapped in a scarf to hide his identity. But there are always security breaches and alternate routes to be exploited. The second man, his face obscured by a black cloth, told CNN that a woman dressed all in black paid him some two to three times the going rate to get into Syria -- right around when Turkish authorities believe Boumeddiene slipped into the country. ""She said 'I will give you 100 lira just get me to Syria,'"" he recalled. ""She was entirely covered in black, like I am now."" It was the first time since the war in Syria began  in 2011 that either of them had taken a woman across on her own. The smuggler said the woman was of medium build, and guessed her age to be -- like Boumeddiene -- in her mid-20s. She spoke classical Arabic and did not have a Syrian accent. That, he claimed, is all he knows. ""I saw the 100 lira and I did not ask anything,"" he told CNN. What the woman paid is roughly $42. On the back of a motorcycle, they headed down a dusty border road dotted with potential illegal crossing points. The Turkish military stopped the CNN team before it could reach the area where the man said the woman crossed into Syria. There is no way of knowing if she was Boumeddiene. But within an hour of her transaction with the smuggler, the woman covered in black was in Syria.","Boumeddiene's last known location is the city of Sanliurfa, by the Turkey-Syria border .

"Zaanse Schans, Netherlands (CNN)Not far from Amsterdam is a living piece of Dutch history. The Zaanse Schans neighborhood celebrates the past as a working community whose roots can be traced back to the 17th century and it's one of the few places in the world where you can still find functioning traditional windmills. The Zaan region is among the oldest industrial areas in the world and in its heyday of the 17th and 18th centuries it was home to around 600 active windmills. At the Zaanse Schans, among its wooden barns, houses and museums, just 10 windmills are still in operation, grinding oil, spices and colorings. One of these historic windmills is ""De Kat,"" meaning ""The Cat,"" which uses wind power to create pigments for paint. The listed building has a rich history; first built between 1646 and 1696, the windmill survived a fire in 1782 and a body rebuild in the 1970s. Piet Kempenaar, the miller at De Kat, has been working with windmills for over 30 years. Every day he stands on the windmill's platform as millers have done for centuries, looking at the sky and feeling the power of the elements. ""You must have a special kind of feeling for this technology,"" Kempenaar says. Kempenaar has to pay close attention to the wind because it dictates the day's work. Each part of the mill, from the wings to the tail, can be adjusted and tweaked to make the most of the wind that day. ""Sometimes you hear a sound and it's a problem with a bearing. Sometimes you listen to the waves on the water and you say, 'oh boy the wind has changed direction.'"" De Kat is a fully functioning paint mill. When the wind is strong, it turns 3,000 kilogram granite stones which grind down limestone into a fine powder and pack it with pigments. ""The weight of the stones are enormous and powered by the cleanest energy in the world,"" Kempenaar says. ""The breeze of the Lord."" This natural process is nothing new; it goes back to the area's roots. ""The whole industrial revolution was born here,"" explains Kempenaar. ""It was all coming by Amsterdam, the main port of the world, the main port of Europe for 300 years, so many boats were arriving in the harbor of Amsterdam on the coast loaded with raw materials and needed an industrial process."" Windmills are a passion Kempenaar has had since he started his studies as a miller in 1978, and he'll continue to preserve this art for as long as the wind continues to blow -- and as long as the Zaanse Schans continue to preserve this reminder of the Dutch Golden Age.","Zaanse Schans, Netherlands is dotted with working windmill sites .

"(CNN)""American Sniper"" stormed the box office this past weekend with $105 million in ticket sales. Not since the Rambo movies have so many farmers and ranch hands buddy-upped to the popcorn counter. As much as I adore Bradley Cooper, I won't be seeing the movie. I can't see it. And my reluctance to see it has nothing to do with Michael Moore's flippant assertion that snipers are cowards (although he said he wasn't talking about the movie). I was always taught that cowards are those who refuse to serve their country. Friends who've seen the movie say I'm missing out. They say it is an accurate portrayal of what happens in war.  One friend, who declares herself as a pacifist, urged me to go. ""Far from glorifying war, it made war look brutal, and a means of destroying people for life,"" she said. What I keep wondering is why all these moviegoers  weren't  lining up to volunteer for war. Before his ironic death, Chris Kyle, on whom the movie is based, denounced Hollywood's version of war. ""Hollywood fantasizes about it and makes it look good. It -- war sucks,"" he told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly in 2012. Clint Eastwood deserves credit for the truth he does show. Women and children are killed more often than Americans like to consider. And good soldiers are always haunted by the comrades they couldn't save. I know. The surgeon who tried to save my soldier father in Vietnam's Ia Drang Valley still considers July 24, 1966, one of the worst days of his life. The men who were there that day tell me that my father grabbed Doc's arm and begged him, ""Don't let me die."" Doc did his best to save my father. I have thanked him for that. Still, he regrets that he didn't save him, and I hate that he lives with that. Maybe that's why I can't see the movie. When you have experienced firsthand the multitude of ways war wreaks havoc on families, you have little tolerance for the mythmaking that war always seems to invoke. Not to mention the patriotic, almost nationalistic fervor that accompanies a flag-draped coffin. Related: Why 'American Sniper' is a smash hit . When my father died there were no crowds gathered at Cowboys Stadium, no JumboTron displaying pictures of the family man my father was, and no front-page stories. There was just a broken family feeling very abandoned by an ungrateful nation. The other reason I can't see the movie is my friend Sgt. Gordon Wofford. Gordon was serving with 9th Infantry Regiment (Manchu), 25th Infantry Division when he was struck by a sniper's bullet on May 28, 1970. The bullet took out his lower jaw and all of his teeth. The company medic, Spec. Ronald Krebsbach, was killed by the next bullet while yanking Gordon to safety. Gordon spent 19 months at Walter Reed relearning skills toddlers know: How to chew. How to talk. How not to slobber all over himself. When I met him in 2005, Gordon was not getting help for his post-traumatic stress disorder. He didn't think he deserved benefits.  Before his death from cancer in 2009, Gordon and I forged a friendship from our experiences in war -- his as a soldier, mine as a Gold Star daughter. Every day as he went through the motions of putting in a set of false teeth, Gordon remembered  the sniper he so longed to forget. Krebsbach, the medic, left behind a young pregnant wife. That always haunted Gordon. He felt bad that he had lived and Krebsbach had died. I serve on a couple of boards of national organizations for veterans. I know by name the men and women who have suffered the aftermath of war. They are not fictional characters to me. Their numbers are in my cell phone. I have wept with them at the Vietnam Memorial Wall in Washington and at graves at Arlington National Cemetery. I have buried my Gold Star mother beside the only man she ever loved, my father. Why 'American Sniper' is a smash hit . Hollywood has a way of fictionalizing war, of making it all about ""us"" and ""them."" ""Ragheads"" was one of the names Kyle gave to the Iraqi people. He said he didn't give a ""flying f**k about the Iraqis."" Kyle dehumanized them. He had to. That's how the military trains snipers like him. ""Every person I killed I strongly believe that they were bad,"" Kyle told the BBC. I have traveled to my father's battlefield in Vietnam and I have befriended Vietnamese who lost even more than I did during the war.  I have learned there is no ""us"" and ""them."" There is only ""us."" Humanity.  All of us. I wish Hollywood would make a war movie that gets that point across.","Karen Spears Zacharias: Hollywood should not glorify war and make it about ""us"" vs. ""them""

"Maputo, Mozambique (CNN)Artists in Mozambique are certainly not lacking inspiration. Whether they draw from their colonial past, independence, or the turbulent years of civil war that followed, many Mozambicans have taken to the canvas to express themselves. It's no wonder the Mozambican art scene is taking the world by storm. For Goncalo Mabunda, the 16-year civil war that ended in 1992 provided not only the muse but the materials for his works. His sculptures -- intricate masks, thrones and figurines -- are molded from recovered weaponry and military equipment, namely old landmines, AK-47s and rocket launchers. Mabunda's work was made possible through the efforts of the Christian Council of Mozambique, a group of local churches that launched the ""Transforming Guns into Hoes Program"", which offers participants tools and building materials in exchange for recovered weapons. ""The war is over. Why do we still need weapons? Let's destroy (them). And I'm glad the government at the time said, 'yes, let's destroy'."" For other artists, like Naguib Elias Abdula -- whose half-mile murals are dotted throughout the landscape of Maputo, the country's capital, independence was the spark plug that got him painting. In 1975, when Mozambique became its own country following a decade-long insurrection against Portugal, the land was covered in debris, and was very much a blank canvas. For Abdula, artwork proved the perfect medium to inform the public. ""At the time, it was necessary to teach the people what's going on. What is independence? What is 'Mozambique'? It was necessary to teach people, and people [didn't] read, so we taught through paintings in the road,"" he says, referring to the low literacy rate back then (literacy has risen to 58.6%, up from 38.7% in 1997, according to UNESCO). Like Mabunda, Abdula's work has achieved international acclaim following an exhibit at the United Nation's headquarters in 1996. Since, he's been shown in countries throughout the world. It is a narrative that is becoming popular in the country, which has started to gain a reputation as an incubator of fine arts. ""There is an artistic movement,"" confirms Arturo Vicente, president of Maputo's Nucleo di Arte, a longstanding exhibition space that showcases many of the country's up-and-coming artists.

"New York (CNN)Two Yemeni nationals have been charged with aiding al Qaeda, authorities announced on Tuesday. The criminal complaint alleges that Saddiq al-Abbadi and Ali Alvi provided material support to the terrorist organization and conspired to murder Americans abroad. ""There is no escape from the reach of our law for violent terrorists, especially if they target our military,"" Loretta Lynch, the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of New York, said in a press release. ""Al-Abbadi and Alvi may have operated in the mountains of Afghanistan, but now they face justice in a courtroom in Brooklyn."" The complaint, which was unsealed on Tuesday, states that both Alvi and al-Abbadi were members of al Qaeda and had both fought against U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Al-Abbadi had also fought in Iraq, ambushing U.S. military convoys, according to court documents. Both men were arrested in Saudi Arabia and then transferred to U.S. custody. Al-Abbadi had already served more than five years of a 12-year prison sentence in Saudi Arabia before he was handed over. Judge Lois Bloom ordered al Abbadi be held without bail until his trial was completed, as he poses a danger to the community as an al Qaeda operative ""with extensive weapon and explosives training,"" according to Zainab Ahmad, one of the prosecutors handling the case. Both Alvi and al-Abbadi face a maximum sentence of life in prison, according to the release. Al-Abbadi has not yet entered a plea in the case and his court-appointed defense attorney refused to add anything after the hearing.

"(CNN)The mother called 911 to say her 5-year-old boy shot his baby brother with a paintball gun. But it wasn't a paintball gun. It was a .22-caliber Magnum revolver. And the 9-month-old boy didn't survive. Authorities are trying to figure out what led to Monday's shooting in Elmo, in the northwest corner of Missouri. ""At this point foul play is not suspected, and it appears at this time that the shooting was accidental,"" the Nodaway County Sheriff's Office said. Sheriff Darren White told CNN affiliate KCTV that the baby was in a playpen when his brother found the gun lying around a bed. When emergency crews arrived, they found the infant had been shot in the head. The child was flown to Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, where he was pronounced dead, the station reported. Authorities say the gun belongs to a relative, but not the mother. Police are investigating the gun's ownership, KCTV reported. The mother's other three children are with relatives, according to the station. The sheriff said guns are rampant in the rural community. ""We are big supporters of firearms around here,"" White told CNN affiliate KETV. ""We have a lot of people that own weapons. They hunt. They target shoot. ... Most people are very safe with them, and this is one of those cases where everything went together in the wrong way."" He added, ""We got some guys that work here that have little kids of their own. ... This kind of hits home with them, too. They take it personally."" Though they say the shooting was accidental, authorities have not determined whether charges will be filed against any adult in the case. At least one nearby resident told KCTV she believes the shooting could have been easily prevented. ""You know, just some gun safety could have come into play, and would have maybe, you know prevented the situation, but it's just really sad, altogether,"" neighbor Jessica Hutchison said. According to Project ChildSafe, gun owners should lock unloaded weapons in a safe, vault or cabinet inaccessible to children. Gun locks should be used in addition to safe storage, and ammunition should be locked away separately from any firearm. Parents should also teach their children that if they find a gun in a house, they should leave it where it is and tell an adult, even if the weapon resembles a toy, the advocacy group says. Monday's incident is the latest in a series of high-profile shootings involving children. Among them, a 4-year-old girl killed her cousin, also 4, in Detroit while playing with a gun found under a bed last January, a 9-year-old accidentally killed a shooting instructor in August while firing a submachine gun at an Arizona range and last month a 2-year-old fatally shot his mother in an Idaho Walmart after finding a gun in her purse.

It was a few years later when he decided to become a TV writer. As Wilmore tells it, he was just being practical. ""I knew Hollywood wasn't going to find me,"" he told New York magazine of his acting years, when the standard casting call wanted black men closer to Eddie Murphy's fast-talking types. ""I needed to be able to control my own destiny. Being an actor was too flighty.""

"(CNN)Ransom is as old as kidnappings, bad guys and money. But it never gets old enough not to demand again, as the Japanese government now knows all too well. In a video posted Tuesday to social media, a black-clad ISIS militant stood over two men he said were Japanese citizens. Both would die, he said, unless the Japanese government paid the Islamist extremist group $200 million within 72 hours. That ISIS wants ransom isn't unexpected. But a few things -- like the public nature and staggering amount of the request -- make it stand out. Yes. It's hard to quantify all the examples, because hostage takers in ambitious militant groups like ISIS rarely make their demands public. But just as kidnappings are the norm for such groups, so is asking for ransom. One documented example is the case of James Foley, an American journalist abducted in northern Syria in November 2012. ISIS would later demand 100 million euros (about $132 million) for his release, said Richard Byrne, a spokesman for the news website GlobalPost that Foley freelanced for before. Neither GlobalPost, nor Foley's family, nor the U.S. government paid that amount. Even if they had, there's no telling if ISIS would have kept its word and freed Foley. Instead, the group not only beheaded Foley, but recorded his killing and put it online for the world to see. One thing that makes the latest ransom request unique is that ISIS made it publicly and set a three-day deadline for it to be met. This suggests as much posturing as fundraising, especially when coupled with its decrying Japan for supporting governments involved in the anti-ISIS fight (even if Tokyo isn't part of the international military coalition going against it). ISIS' rationale seems similar to other terror groups: Kidnappings help raise money and, if ransoms aren't paid, make a point, such as the groups are not to be messed with and even civilians are in danger. Rationalizing the public relations strategy of a group like ISIS can be a challenge. But there's no doubt the group uses modern technology to get the word out on its captives, including when they are beheaded. Such pictures further the image of ISIS as a ruthless, defiant organization dedicated to wiping out anyone -- soldiers or civilians -- who doesn't follow its extreme conservative version of Sharia law. The money-making aspect is more under the radar, but still significant. The U.S. Treasury Department estimated in 2012 that al Qaeda and its affiliates (which don't include ISIS, though the terror groups have similarities) compiled $120 million from ransoms over the previous eight years.  And a New York Times investigative piece from July 2014 determined that al Qaeda and its affiliates took in $125 million since 2008, including $66 million in 2013 alone. There hasn't been a similarly detailed review for ISIS, but that doesn't mean ransoms -- in addition to things like oil revenues, criminal enterprises as well as taxes, tolls and other fees imposed on those in its territories -- aren't a significant part of the group's budget. Countries don't advertise how much they pay in ransom; doing so could invite kidnappers to seize their citizens for ransom. But that doesn't mean some countries don't do it. The summer 2014 New York Times article, citing French media reports, identified France as the country that pays out the most to al Qaeda affiliates. France's reported $58 million figure, since 2008, is far higher than the next-highest total, $20 million, as paid out from Oman and Qatar. The Times reports that Switzerland paid out $12 million, Spain $11 million and Austria $3 million in the same time frame. It's not just al Qaeda that France has dealt with: Four French journalists taken captive by ISIS were released last April. A group's ransom request could depend on a lot of factors. A high-profile hostage, for instance, could demand a higher price. And a solitary kidnapper may ask less than one belonging to a large, powerful, defiant group -- especially one, like ISIS, that's proved its willingness to kill civilians. The amount of ransom requested and paid apparently has gone up. A decade ago, the Times reported that a standard asking price might be $200,000. Nowadays, it's more likely to be in the millions. Phil Balboni, GlobalPost's CEO, told CNN that European governments have paid between $2 million and $4 million for hostages. But it is not $200 million, as was requested for the two Japanese hostages. Nor is it the $132 million requested for Foley. Both figures from ISIS are exceedingly high and seem to suggest the group is as interested in making a point (and killing its captives) as it is in making money, given the unlikelihood it will be paid. On Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe did not rule out paying a ransom or negotiating with his two citizens' captors. Does that mean Tokyo is willing to pay, or at least, talk? Not necessarily. Japan hasn't said it has paid ransoms before, and there's no reason to think the country would in this case. Japan signed a 2013 G8 communique that stated, ""We unequivocally reject the payment of ransoms to terrorists, and we call on countries and companies around the world to follow our lead to stamp this out."" This policy mirrors those of the United Kingdom and the United States, with Foley's mother, Diane, telling CNN that a U.S. official once threatened her with prosecution if she tried to raise ransom on her own. Why wouldn't countries like these two and Japan tap into their relatively vast resources to save the lives of their citizens? For one thing, groups like ISIS and al Qaeda may not be the most trustworthy, so paying up won't necessarily guarantee a release. And it might end up putting others at risk, both by encouraging more kidnappings and funding those behind mass killings. As Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen argued in 2012, ""Ransom payments lead to future kidnappings, and future kidnappings lead to additional ransom payments.  And it all builds the capacity of terrorist organizations to conduct attacks."" Some say that countries with no-ransom policies can end up giving militant groups incentives to kidnap more people if they negotiate with them. This debate raged after the Taliban's release of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl last year in exchange for five Taliban figures then in U.S. military custody at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. President Barack Obama said afterward, ""I make absolutely no apologies for making sure we get a young man back to his parents."" In Japan's case, such a prisoner swap isn't an option. It's not as if the country has a lot of suspected ISIS members in its custody. So Tokyo's bargaining chips might consist more of doing something like not giving $200 million to those invested in the anti-ISIS fight -- a pledge that Abe said Tuesday he's not willing to rescind. ISIS' history shows there may not be a lot, but it's possible that there will be talks with the ISIS hostage takers. Japan can point to the fact that unlike the United States and Britain, it's not involved directly with the military effort in Iraq or Syria. ISIS might surprise everyone by freeing the Japanese pair as a goodwill gesture. But absent a last-ditch diplomatic effort, Japan may have to rely on military forces from allies in the West, the Middle East or elsewhere to rescue its citizens. Whatever the approach, time is clearly running out.","On a video, ISIS demands $200 million to release two Japanese citizens .

"New York  (CNN)A team of senior-level FBI agents with decades of experience in long-term criminal and public corruption cases are handling the federal civil rights investigation into the controversial chokehold death of an unarmed black man by a white police officer, two law enforcement sources said Tuesday. The New York-based agents have come together in recent weeks following a December grand jury decision to not indict the police officer, the sources told CNN. The goal is a ""fresh look"" into the July death of Eric Garner at the hands of police Officer Daniel Pantaleo, in a case that led to anti-police demonstrations throughout the nation, a senior law enforcement official said. The veteran investigators include an agent from the white-collar crime division who specializes in long-term criminal investigations, a supervisor in the public corruption unit and an agent who investigated the infamous 1997 police torture case involving Haitian immigrant Abner Louima, the source said . The investigation, which began in earnest after a grand jury declined to indict the officer, will look at everything from the actions of the responding officers and paramedics on the Staten Island street where Garner died to the role NYPD training may have played in the death, according to the source. The New York City Police Department prohibits chokeholds. ""We want ... to take a fresh look,"" the senior official said. Pantaleo's attorney, Stuart London, said the agents will find ""there was no willful conduct with the specific intent to violate a federally protected right."" ""This was a simple street encounter and race wasn't an issue,"" he said. During Garner's fatal police encounter on July 17, he raised both hands in the air and told the officers not to touch him. Seconds later, a video shows an officer behind Garner grab him in a chokehold and pull him to the sidewalk, rolling him onto his stomach. ""I can't breathe! I can't breathe!"" Garner said repeatedly, his cries muffled into the pavement. Garner, 43, was pronounced dead that day. Police had suspected Garner of selling cigarettes illegally. Eric Garner: The haunting last words of a dying man . As part of the federal investigation, FBI agents have visited the scene of Garner's death. They're also interviewing witnesses as well as reviewing witness testimony, the senior official said. The investigation is overseen by the federal prosecutor's office in Brooklyn. The agents will also look over evidence from the NYPD's internal affairs investigation and may ask to interview officers and emergency medical technicians who responded, the official said. Another aspect of the probe will be whether a chokehold was in fact used in restraining Garner, the senior official said. The cause of Garner's death was ""compression of neck (chokehold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police,"" the medical examiner's office has said. The death was ruled a homicide. The medical examiner also listed acute and chronic bronchial asthma, obesity and hypertensive cardiovascular disease as contributing factors in Garner's death. The grand jury was made up of 14 white and nine nonwhite members, according to law enforcement sources. A total of 12 jurors who heard all the evidence must be in agreement for a decision. Videos document Garner's last moments . The case became emblematic of longstanding tensions between police and minority communities, especially given that the majority of people stopped under the NYPD's former ""stop-and-frisk"" police policy were African-American or Hispanic. A federal court ruled that stop-and-frisk was unconstitutional and tantamount to racial profiling. Garner's death led to demonstrations around the city and came weeks before the racially charged police shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Separate grand jury decisions declining to prosecute police officers in connection with both deaths sparked national protests that sometimes involved clashes with police. After the death, Pantaleo was put on modified assignment and stripped of his badge and gun amid the investigation, and the NYPD commissioner ordered an extensive review of training procedures. Two lawsuits have previously been filed against Pantaleo. The plaintiffs in both suits allege false arrest, unlawful imprisonment, civil rights violations and other charges. One suit from 2013 was dismissed in January 2014, while the second, from February 2014, remains open.","Senior FBI agents lead federal civil rights investigation in chokehold death .

"(CNN)A Montana pipeline burst sent as much as 50,400 gallons of oil gushing into the Yellowstone River, prompting the governor to declare a state of emergency. Residents in nearby cities were told not to drink the tap water, which some said smelled like diesel. The massive oil spill happened when the 12-inch pipeline, which crosses the Yellowstone River, ruptured Saturday about 5 miles upstream from Glendive, Montana's Department of Environmental Quality said. The Bridger Pipeline company shut down the pipeline. Glendive City Council member Gerald Reichert was among the residents who noticed a disturbing odor in the drinking water. ""Suddenly at our house there was a definite smell. It was a diesel smell,"" Reichert told the Grand Forks Herald. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock announced a state of emergency for  Dawson and Richland counties. And while officials wait for results from water sample testing, they're advising residents to use bottled water for drinking and cooking. A host of agencies have responded to the oil spill, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services. Adding to the problems, the weather: the Yellowstone River is partially frozen, making it difficult to clean up the mess. This isn't the first major oil spill into the Yellowstone River -- the longest undammed river in the United States. In 2011, up to 42,000 gallons poured out of a ruptured Exxon Mobil pipeline. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","An oil pipeline that crosses the Yellowstone River burst near Glendive, Montana .

"(CNN)The hunt is still on for the ringleader behind a terrorist cell targeted in raids last week. The suspected key link between senior ISIS operatives in Syria and the Belgian terrorist cell, Belgian-Moroccan ISIS fighter Abdelhamid Abaaoud, is still at large, a senior Belgian counterterrorism official said. Abaaoud's last known location was believed to be Greece, the official said. From Antwerp to Aleppo and back: Europe's nightmare . As Belgium's search continues, other European nations are also moving in on suspected Islamist cells amid concerns heightened by the terror attacks in Paris two weeks ago. Here's a look at the latest developments: - . Police in Berlin, Brandenburg and Thuringen raided 13 properties linked to suspected radical Islamists overnight, police in the German capital said Tuesday. Most of the action was directed at a group connected to a mosque in the district of Berlin-Moabit. The overnight raids are part of the investigation into two alleged Islamists who were arrested Friday, identified as Ismet D. and Emin F., Berlin police said. Both of them are accused of providing logistical aid to ISIS. Some 200 police officers were involved in the raids at 13 sites across three German states. Those subject to the raids have not yet been accused of any crimes, but had contact with Ismet D. and Emin F. There are no indications that the group was preparing attacks in Germany. Five Belgian nationals have been charged with participation in a terrorist organization in connection with last week's raids, federal prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt said. The terror cell was on the brink of an attack and planned to target police officers, he said. Belgian counterterrorism agencies say they suspect that the ringleader of the cell is Abaaoud, the senior Belgian counterterrorism official said. Abaaoud is also known as Abou Omar Soussi and Abou Omar al Belgiki, the official said. According to Guy Van Vlierden, a reporter at the Belgian newspaper HLN who tracks Belgian foreign fighters in Syria for the blog ""emmejihad,"" Abaaoud is a 27-year-old from the Molenbeek district of Brussels who traveled to Syria in January 2014 and joined ISIS soon afterward. The two gunmen killed in one of the raids, in the city of Verviers, are Belgians of North African descent from the same Brussels district. They were in phone contact with an ISIS ringleader in Greece, who Belgian authorities believe was probably Abaaoud. But Belgian authorities have not ruled out the possibility that an Algerian suspect arrested in Greece over the weekend was the key link between the terror cell and ISIS. That 33-year-old suspect was wanted in Belgium on charges of terrorist activity, Greek police said Monday. Belgium is requesting an extradition. One suspect survived the police raid in Verviers, named as Marouane El Bali. He was taken into custody and faces charges of participation in a terrorist organization and possession of explosives with intent to commit a criminal attack, among other charges, said his attorney, Didier De Quevy. But De Quevy said his client was not involved in any terrorism; he was just delivering shoes to a friend when he was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. Five men --  purportedly Russians of Chechen origin -- were arrested in southern France overnight while planning an act of terrorism, according to French media reports Tuesday. A cache of explosives was found, according to Midi Libre and other media outlets, quoting police sources and the local prosecutor, Yvon Calvet. CNN has not yet been able to confirm the reports. Meanwhile, the Paris prosecutor's office said Tuesday that four men arrested Friday are being placed under criminal investigation in connection with the Paris terror attacks. They are under investigation for association with a criminal terrorist organization with the objective of committing crimes against people. In addition, one of those in custody will be under formal investigation for possession or transport of weapons linked to a terrorist enterprise. The four men, ages  22, 25, 26 and 28, will remain in custody. Five other suspects held since Friday were released Monday night. Investigators say DNA found in a car used to transport Jewish market attack gunman Amedy Coulibaly has been traced to a man who is already in custody in connection with the attacks, according to a source familiar with the ongoing investigation. Investigators are still looking for a person whose DNA was found on a magazine for Coulibaly's gun. Coulibaly killed four hostages on January 9 at a kosher grocery store in Paris before police killed him. He's also believed to have killed a policewoman a day earlier. Before the siege, he had proclaimed his allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. New surveillance video obtained by CNN shows Coulibaly and his partner Hayat Boumedienne outside a Jewish institution in Paris. The video was recorded at the end of August or beginning of September and stored on a security camera. A source familiar with the ongoing investigation into the Paris attacks says the nature of the video makes it clear that the couple was carrying out surveillance of possible targets for several months before Coulibaly launched his attack against the kosher supermarket. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio visited the scene of the siege Tuesday, and he added flowers to a mound of bouquets, candles and handwritten tributes to those killed. He voiced his solidarity with France as it combats terrorism, and he met with representatives of the Jewish community. The supermarket assault happened during three days of terror in Paris that began with the January 7 attack on offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical newspaper by gunmen Said and Cherif Kouachi. In all, 12 people died in the Charlie Hebdo attack. The funeral for maintenance worker Frederic Boisseau, the first person to be killed, took place Tuesday. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al Qaeda's Yemen affiliate, claimed responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo shootings. France's Le Monde newspaper suffered a different kind of attack on Tuesday, when its official Twitter account was apparently hacked by the Syrian Electronic Army, a group of pro-Syrian regime hackers that has aggressively targeted major news organizations and activists. One post that appeared on the newspaper's Twitter account said, ""Je ne suis pas Charlie"" (""I am not Charlie"") and decried attacks on Syria. ""After the hacking of our account, our teams have taken it back into our hands,"" the newspaper's account said in another tweet about an hour later. ""We apologize for any fraudulent posts on our behalf."" CNN's Paul Cruickshank, Tim Lister, Sandrine Amiel, Marilia Brocchetto, Anna-Maja Rappard and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Syrian Electronic Army hacks French newspaper Le Monde's Twitter account .

"(CNN)Shortly after his tweet proclaiming ""snipers aren't heroes"" netted a barrage of criticism, documentary filmmaker Michael Moore tried to explain where that sentiment came from -- his war veteran father. The controversial tweet Sunday came as ""American Sniper,"" the Oscar-nominated biopic of a former Navy SEAL and sharpshooter, won the weekend box office. ""My uncle killed by sniper in WW2,"" Moore tweeted. ""We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse."" The backlash soon followed. Former U.S. House Speaker and CNN contributor Newt Gingrich invited Moore to spend some time with terrorist cells overseas, then weigh in on the value of snipers. But Moore explained his tweet in a Facebook post: . ""My dad was in the First Marine Division in the South Pacific in World War II. His brother, my uncle, Lawrence Moore, was an Army paratrooper and was killed by a Japanese sniper 70 years ago next month,"" Moore wrote. ""My dad always said, 'Snipers are cowards. They don't believe in a fair fight. Like someone coming up from behind you and coldcocking you. Just isn't right. It's cowardly to shoot a person in the back. Only a coward will shoot someone who can't shoot back.'"" The ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and ""Bowling for Columbine"" director has long been a staunch advocate for stricter gun control laws in the United States, and his statements are known to court controversy. Opinion: Why I refuse to see 'American Sniper' But Moore stressed that his comments were not a jab at the movie ""American Sniper,"" which earned $105 million in weekend ticket sales and nabbed six Academy Award nominations last week, including best picture. The box office take trumped previous records for a January opening. ""I didn't say a word about 'American Sniper' in my tweets,"" Moore wrote on Facebook. ""Here's what I think about American Sniper': Awesome performance from Bradley Cooper. One of the best of the year. Great editing. Costumes, hair, makeup superb!"" Why 'American Sniper' is a smash hit . Actor Seth Rogen equated the war drama to a Nazi propaganda film shown in Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds."" Rogen later clarified his statement, tweeting, ""I just said something 'kinda reminded' me of something else. I actually liked American Sniper. It just reminded me of the Tarantino scene."" ""American Sniper"" is based on the best-selling memoir of the same name by Chris Kyle. Kyle served four tours in Iraq with the Navy SEALs and is lauded as ""America's deadliest sniper."" He was not without controversy of his own, including disputed claims in his book that he punched former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura and killed two armed carjackers.

"(CNN)The poster boy for the Australian Open isn't quite sure he is the right man for the job. For once, four-time winners Roger Federer or Novak Djokovic are not center stage, and tennis hunk Rafael Nadal has been muscled out in Melbourne. The face of the fortnight belongs to homegrown hope Nick Kyrgios -- the highest ranked Australian on the men's tour. Wearing fluorescent sneakers, mismatched socks and a sharp haircut, the world No. 50 exudes typical Australian surfer cool on court but he has mixed feelings about his new found status. ""They could have chosen a lot more better-looking people than me,"" Kyrgios jokes to Open Court presenter Pat Cash in an interview before the first grand slam of the new tennis season started. ""When I saw myself up on a poster here ... well, it's just great to be play in front of a home crowd. I'm really excited."" Kyrgios first sent the green and gold clad home fans into a frenzy when he won the Australian Open boys' singles title in 2013. A meteoric 2014 season then saw the Canberra big-hitter rise from world No.186 to Nadal's vanquisher at Wimbledon. Kyrgios became the first wild card in a decade to reach the quarterfinals of the grass court grand slam, firing a career high 37 aces past the two-time Wimbledon champion and bamboozling him with an array of trick shots. Tennis experts immediately picked him out as future champion, a successor to Australia's last grand slam star Lleyton Hewitt, winner of the 2002 Wimbledon crown. ""That's a match I'm never going to forget,"" smiles Kyrgios, now ranked as world No. 50. ""That was the best serving and returning performance I've had in my life. ""Every time I get out on court I'm always thinking about it. It is confidence and motivation to train hard. ""When you're injured, to know that you can play at that level, it's motivation to get healthy and get back out on the court."" That's a reference to when the Australian's season hit the rocks in September because of fatigue and a niggling back injury after his Wimbledon whirlwind and a solid third round appearance at the U.S. Open,. Those injuries might be another reason for Kyrgios' reluctance to get caught up in the hype ahead of the Australian Open, which began in Melbourne, Monday. His competitive tour return at the Sydney International, five days before the start of the Australian Open, ended in a first round defeat by Poland's Jerzy Janowicz. The 19-year-old Australian had little time to get match fit for his home grand slam, so a five-set slog past Argentina's Federico Delbonis was probably not what he needed in the first round. One of two Australian players to reach round four, Kyrgios is determined not to get sucked into the pressure of  home expectation. ""Geez, I'm not going to put too much pressure on myself,"" he says. ""But I'd love to go out there and make a run like at Wimbledon. ""I definitely think I can make an impact if I'm healthy and feeling good. I can definitely match up with some of the best. ""There is a lot of expectation. I'm still young, I'm still maturing. I understand that it's a long journey and I'm ready for that."" Life on the peripatetic professional tennis tour means the 19-year-old is getting used to making personal sacrifices. He started playing tennis at seven, encouraged by his Malaysian mother Norlaila, who he promised to send a smiley face text to him after his victory over Nadal. His Dad George and older sister Halimah were in London to share in his success but his grandmother, who Kyrgios describes as ""a massive part of my life,"" died just a week after his Wimbledon breakthrough. Kyrgios is beginning the new season with the number 74, in homage to his grandmother, tattooed on his finger. ""I'm still trying to deal with some things in my life that have changed,"" he explains. ""Sacrificing time at home, grinding out tournaments week after week. ""I'm still learning how to deal with being away from friends and family. I think I'm dealing with it pretty well but I'm still a kid."" The Australian may only be at the start of his senior career but he is already learning from the best -- his idol, Federer. ""If I was to build my game around someone it would be Roger,"" adds Krygios. ""He's the greatest of all time. It's extraordinary how consistent he's been. ""I got an opportunity to train with Roger in Zurich for a week last year. ""It was such a good opportunity to see what he would do on the practice court and his ability to create drills for himself, to develop his game. ""He's still striving to get so much better and develop his game. That's what I learned so much from."" Federer entered the Australian Open as the men's second seed, behind Djokovic, while Kyrgios was relieved of some pressure by being unseeded. If he has doubts over this poster boy status, the Australian is looking forward to playing the role of crowd pleaser. ""Being able to get the crowd involved, hit shots they're going to love, that's what excites me most,"" he smiles. ""Playing on courts like the Rod Laver Arena, it just gives me goosebumps thinking about it. I'll try to keep the crowd going for as long as I can.""","Teenager Nick Kyrgios is the top-ranked home player at the Australian Open .

"(CNN)NASA released new images Monday of the dwarf planet Ceres that hint at crater-like structures on the surface. The images of Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, were taken by the Dawn spacecraft from a distance of 238,000 miles on January 13. With a diameter of about 590 miles, NASA describes the dwarf planet as ""Texas-sized."" ""We know so much about the solar system and yet so little about dwarf planet Ceres. Now, Dawn is ready to change that,"" Marc Rayman, Dawn's chief engineer and mission director, said in a release from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. NASA's Hubble Space Telescope took the best images to date of Ceres in 2003 and 2004. While the latest set of images is only at about 80% of Hubble's resolution, NASA expects the decade-old images to be eclipsed when the spacecraft has another imaging opportunity at the end of this month. Dawn, which was launched in 2007, is expected to enter the dwarf planet's orbit around March 6 for the first time. Scientists have long thought the surface contains vast portions of ice or even an ocean, and have previously detected water vapor. Ceres falls into the same unique category of dwarf planets as Pluto.  According to the International Astronomical Union, this classification is for a celestial body that ""is in orbit around the sun,"" ""has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape"" but is not able to ""clear the neighborhood around its orbit,"" meaning the body is big enough to clear objects like asteroids and debris out of its orbital way.","NASA's Dawn spacecraft delivers new images of the dwarf planet Ceres .

"(CNN)Republican operatives linked to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have launched a new super PAC focused on keeping the Senate in GOP hands in 2016, when they'll face a much tougher map and a political climate that favors Democrats. The new super PAC, called the Senate Leadership Fund, will work with American Crossroads, another major GOP super PAC, to defend Republican-held seats and help nominate the most electable candidates in primaries to contest Democratic-held seats, according to a source familiar with the group's plans. The source said the group will operate largely in general election and open-seat primary battles, but may also engage in defense of incumbents facing primary challenges. American Crossroads will also be heavily engaged in the GOP presidential general election fight, and Republicans will have 24 seats to defend in 2016 — far more than the 10 Democrats must defend, and many in blue-leaning or purple states that are more favorable to Democrats in a presidential year. Senate Leadership Fund will aim to pick up some of the slack at the Senate level, and will coordinate messaging, media buys and fundraising with American Crossroads. Stephen Law, McConnell's former chief of staff who currently heads up American Crossroads, will also sit on the board of the Senate Leadership Fund. ""The U.S. Senate is under new management — and is taking on President Obama's freedom-constricting, big-government agenda,"" the group's website says. ""As a new, independent super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund has one goal: to protect and expand the Republican Senate majority when Harry Reid, Elizabeth Warren and their army of left-wing activists try to take it back in 2016."" According to the New York Times, which first reported news of the group's creation, McConnell and his allies have conceived of the group as an answer to the Senate Majority PAC, the Democratic super PAC launched by operatives with ties to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid that engaged heavily in Senate races this past cycle.","Allies of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are launching a super PAC focused on Senate races .

"Paris (CNN)A traumatic event, such as the 9/11 attacks or the assault on Charlie Hebdo in Paris two weeks ago, can produce huge shifts in public opinion. A surge in patriotism, perhaps higher church attendances -- but one would not expect it to boost the work of an 18th century writer. In France, and especially in Paris, the mood over the past two weeks has been subdued, but punctured by public displays of solidarity across faiths. In a famously fractious society, there is a sense of cohesion. The French seemed to have coalesced in reaching back into their history and the Enlightenment: They have started reading Voltaire. One of France's most renowned philosophers, Voltaire published his ""Treatise on Tolerance"" in 1763.  It was an appeal for religious tolerance, within and between faiths. The French publisher Folio says sales of the ""Treatise"" have increased significantly since the Charlie Hebdo attacks. Between 2003 and the beginning of this year, Folio had sold 120,000 copies of the book -- roughly 10,000 a year. From January 12 to 14, immediately after the rally in Paris in support of free speech and tolerance, some 7,000 copies were sold. Folio said another 20,000 new copies would be made available to cope with demand. Online orders on Amazon and Kindle have also spiked. When first published, the ""Treatise"" was a revolutionary creed, and one that landed Voltaire in trouble with the French government and especially powerful religious interests, such as the Jesuits. His message has endured to become a cornerstone of the French republic, where the state and religion are formally and forcefully separated. But Voltaire went far beyond the rifts within Christianity in the ""Treatise."" ""I say that we should regard all men as our brothers,"" he wrote. ""What? The Turk my brother? The Chinaman my brother? The Jew? The Siam? Yes, without doubt; are we not all children of the same father and creatures of the same God?"" Voltaire wrote the ""Treatise"" because he was outraged by the execution of a Protestant man, Jean Calas, who was wrongly convicted of murdering his own son to prevent him from converting to Catholicism. His campaign to clear Jean Calas went all the way to King Louis XV, who pardoned Calas posthumously. Paris mayor: We'll sue Fox News . Last week, the justice minister here, socialist Christiane Taubira, celebrated Voltaire's legacy when speaking at the memorial for the Charlie Hebdo cartoonist Tignous. ""We can draw anything, including a prophet, because in France, the France of Voltaire and irreverence, we have the right to make fun of religions,"" she said. ""A right. Yes, because a right is democracy and democracy is the realm of the law."" That sentiment was shared across the political spectrum. Writing in Le Figaro on Tuesday, former Prime Minister Dominique Villepin said that ""Faced with the drama that struck it, France has shown great dignity."" Villepin, from the conservative UMP, wrote that, ""The people have chosen by instinct loyalty to France."" It was fitting, and perhaps not accidental, that when world leaders gathered at the rally last week to commemorate those killed in Paris, they began their walk down the Boulevard Voltaire, toward the Place de la Nation. Scattered around them, among the many tributes, posters of the writer bordered with the motto: ""Je suis Charlie."" Some of the marchers waved copies of ""A Treatise on Tolerance"" as they walked and left them at impromptu memorials in the Place de la Republique. The chateau at Versailles, once the residence of royalty, devoted the Hall of the Pope to a portrait of Voltaire in honor of the victims of the terror attack. Underneath, a sign quotes from the ""Treatise"": ""What is tolerance? It is the prerogative of humanity."" Opinion: Attacks show hypocrisy of West's outrage . The Societe Voltaire, charged with keeping the philosopher's flame alive, says the attacks in Paris were also an attempt to assassinate him. In an article in L'Express, the Societe said Voltaire's lifelong struggle was to ""crush the infamous"" (a saying with which he often ended his letters) and defend the victims of fanaticism. In the words of the Societe's Alain Sager: ""The border today is not between the religious and the atheist, between the Christian and non-Christian, Muslim and non-Muslim, between the Jewish and non-Jewish. It is between barbarism and civilization."" Among the millions of tweets in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo killings, not a few cited these words attributed to Voltaire: ""I do not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it."" Voltaire never actually said that. The phrase was invented by his English biographer many years later. But he did write this, in ""A Treatise on Tolerance"": ""The fewer dogmas, the fewer disputes; the fewer disputes, the fewer miseries: If this is not true, then I'm wrong."" Two-hundred-fifty years later, the words have new resonance.","After Charlie Hebdo attacks, French find comfort in writing from 1763 .

"(CNN)In a line-up of the world's financial heavyweights, Christine Lagarde commands attention. At almost 6ft tall, with a head of silver hair and year-long tan, the first female to lead the International Monetary Fund instantly stands out in the notoriously masculine world of finance. When the fifth most powerful woman in the world according to Forbes takes to the stage, journalists make sure their pens are poised. And in a time of economic austerity -- not to mention scandal allegations regarding the IMF's former managing director -- the media spotlight on Lagarde is fierce. But away from the camera lens, what personal events shaped the 59-year-old financial leader we know today? Here are five things you might not know about Lagarde. ""Clearly the death of my father when I was 16 was a pivotal moment because you suddenly realize the hardship, the pain,"" Lagarde told CNN's Gabriella Frias. ""It certainly provided me with a better understanding of how tough it can be for a single mother to raise kids."" Lagarde won a bronze medal in the French National Championship when she was just 15-years-old. Synchronized swimming might also have more in common with politics than you think. ""It was synchronized swimming that taught me: 'Grit your teeth and smile,'"" Lagarde told the Guardian. ""It was when I applied to the biggest law firm in Paris and I was told that I would be a great recruit and that I would be given good work to do -- but that I should never expect to make partnership because I was a woman,"" Lagarde told CNN. ""I thought to myself: 'You don't deserve me, I'm going.' And I had that sense of extraordinary freedom, walking down the staircase and thinking to myself: 'What would I do in this firm? Why would I work with that kind of attitude?"" ""For a while I felt sort of held back and I decided: 'No, no, no, no, no, no you have to get over it,'"" Lagarde told CNN. ""You need to try to take the learnings from that failure and ask yourself: 'Why did I fail?' Then you learn about it and you move on."" It's perhaps fitting that the IMF boss -- who oversees the world's finances -- was born on such a neat date.

"Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton's most vocal critics have long tried to tie the former secretary of state to President Barack Obama, hoping that her 2016 run would be dragged down by the somewhat unpopular president. But ahead of Tuesday's State of the Union address, critics say Clinton is making their job easy. Tim Miller, the executive director of America Rising, an anti-Clinton communications and research super PAC, argues in talking points to other Republicans that Clinton is tying herself to Obama by working with and hiring many of his staffers ahead of her all-but-certain 2016 run. ""By hiring his key political and policy staff and making no public moves to place clear distance between herself and the President on issues likely to be front and center in the coming Congress, Clinton is signaling that she's not just from the same party as the President, but that she's an Obama Democrat, who will back his policies, pursue his agenda, and represent a Third Term of the Obama Administration,"" Miller argues in a memo to the group's supporters. Since last year, Clinton has been meeting with a broad array of Democratic operatives and possible campaign staffers ahead of a possible 2016 run. But in the last month, Clinton has reportedly began to tap certain Democratic operatives -- many with ties to Obama's two successful presidential runs -- for certain jobs on her nascent campaign. John Podesta, a top aide on the Obama White House, has said a number of times that he plans to leave the White House in early February and would happily work for Clinton is she runs. ""If she runs, as I hope she will, I will do whatever she asks me to do,"" Podesta, who previously worked as chief of staff to former President Bill Clinton, said on the Charlie Rose Show in November. ""Right now she hasn't made a decision to run, so I am expecting to return to what I was doing before."" Democrats widely expect -- and other outlets have reported -- that Podesta will serve as Clinton's campaign chairman, should she run. In the memo, Miller argues that Podesta's inclusion on team Clinton is the biggest sign of her joining with Obama. ""He [Podesta] will bring that same policy agenda, willingness to subvert Congress and rhetoric to Team Clinton,"" he writes. What's more, Clinton has reportedly selected pollsters Joel Benenson, John Anzalone, David Binder and media adviser Jim Margolis for top roles in the campaign. All have worked in similar capacities for either the President's 2008 or 2012 campaigns. Clinton allies have long expressed concern that one of the most effective critiques could be that her presidency, should she run and be elected, would be nothing more than President Barack Obama's third term. But Clinton allies have become more upbeat about being tied to Obama in the last few months given improved economic indicators. Adrienne Elrod, spokeswoman for Correct the Record, a pro-Clinton super PAC, said Miller's energy behind the Clinton memo could have been dedicated at another possible 2016 candidate. ""America Rising, â€‹the Super PAC where Tim Miller works, is essentially a pro-Romney organization founded by staffers from Mitt Romney's failed 2012 presidential campaign. They would serve themselves better to focus on their growing Romney shadow campaign for their party's nomination."" Republicans have been closely watching for Clinton to break with Obama on certain issues, while at the same time labeling her 2016 run as ""Obama's Third Term."" ""Beyond Clinton's issues agenda, her campaign's political leadership is shaping up to be staffed not by her own former campaign advisers, but rely heavily on President Obama's 2012 campaign leadership,"" Miller writes. ""Put bluntly: the state of the Obama-Clinton 2016 Union is strong.""","A key Republican attack on a would-be Hillary Clinton presidential run would be that she'd be Obama's third term .

"(CNN)The happiest place on Earth just got a bit sadder for some of its employees. Due to a recent measles outbreak, several Disneyland workers are being tested for the virus. Five employees were diagnosed with measles, and three of them have fully recovered, Disneyland says. ""The measles outbreak exposure period of December 17-20 at the Disneyland Resort is over, and all cases from this exposure should have occurred by January 10, 2015,"" the California Department of Public Health says. ""No new cases have been identified in guests who visited after that time period."" Disneyland said it was informed of measles cases among employees on January 15. Measles is a respiratory disease caused by a virus and spread through the air, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As for symptoms, ""measles starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and sore throat,"" the CDC says. The outbreak apparently surfaced with five Disney employees who were diagnosed with measles, three who have fully recovered, Disneyland says. Disneyland said it was informed of measles cases among employees on January 15. Previously, public health officials in California and Utah confirmed nine cases among visitors to either Disneyland or Disney California Adventure Park. After Orange County health officials notified Disneyland of that on January 7, ""We immediately began to communicate to our cast to raise awareness,"" the theme park's Chief Medical Officer Dr. Pamela Hymel said in a statement.  Disneyland refers to its employees as cast members. ""In an abundance of caution, we also offered vaccinations and immunity tests. To date, a few Cast Members have tested positive and some have been medically cleared and returned to work.  Cast Members who may have come in contact with those who were positive are being tested for the virus.  While awaiting results, they have been put on paid leave until medically cleared."" It's not clear how many of the theme park employees were vaccinated. So far, five children and 13 adults have been diagnosed with measles in Orange County, according to the county health agency. One school in Huntington Beach has barred children who could not prove that they were vaccinated for measles from going to school until January 29, according to the county health agency. Those showing measles symptoms shouldn't be bashful about seeing their doctor, because a full body rash is likely to break out next. ""If you have symptoms, and believe you may have been exposed, please contact your health care provider,"" said Dr. Ron Chapman, director of the state health department. Vaccination is key. ""Two doses of measles-containing vaccine (MMR vaccine) are more than 99 percent effective in preventing measles,"" the press release said.  ""Measles vaccines have been available in the United States since 1963, and two doses have been recommended since 1989."" Measles was considered eliminated in the United States in 2000, though 2014 saw a record-breaking number of confirmed cases: 644 from 27 states, according to the CDC. That's ""the highest number of cases since measles elimination was documented in the U.S. in 2000,"" the CDC says on its website. ""Travelers to areas where measles is endemic can bring measles back to the U.S., resulting in limited domestic transmission of measles,"" read a statement from the California Department of Public Health. ""Disney and other theme parks in California are international attractions and visitors come from many parts of the world, including those where measles is endemic."" 5 things to know about measles .

"(CNN)Kenyan police have fueled outrage by tear-gassing schoolchildren who were protesting over a playground. The children, along with teachers and activists, were demonstrating after the playground was walled off during the holidays, said Boniface Mwangi, who participated in the protest. The playground, near the Langata Primary School, had reportedly been confiscated for the construction of a parking lot. Video showed students and activists pushing, kicking and hitting the wall with planks of wood. Children wearing their green school sweaters held signs calling the seizure of the playground ""terror against children"" and Kenya ""the land of shameless grabbers."" Some of the students taking part were as young as 6, Mwangi said. Riot police responded to the demonstration by unleashing plumes of tear gas that sent the children fleeing in panic. As news of the police's actions spread, thousands of people voiced anger on social media, using the hashtag #OccupyPlayGround. Children were ""promised laptops not canisters of tear gas,"" tweeted former Kenyan Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka. ""Someone must be held accountable."" Some children were treated in hospital after the incident, Mwangi said. At least one police officer was also hurt. Kenyan media reported that the police officer in charge of the operation at the playground has been suspended. Police didn't respond to CNN's request for comment. Some people on social media blamed the adult activists for the chaotic scenes. ""What has #OccupyPlayGround achieved apart from crying terrorised children, activists pushing agenda via kids?"" wrote a Twitter user on the handle @SnrMbatha. But Mwangi disputed that claim. ""This is kids' action,"" he said. ""They want back their playground and they came back to get their playground."" The children were set to go back to school Tuesday. But not without the memory of what Mwangi called ""a dark, sad day for Kenya.""","The playground was walled off during the holidays, an activist says .

"Washington (CNN) An Army combat engineer from Ohio, Army Staff Sgt. Jason Gibson's job was to clear the road of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). ""One guy had the metal detector, and if anything got a hit we'd check it out,"" Gibson said. ""We wanted to make sure the rest of the troops moving through were safe. We wanted to make sure it was us first."" Gibson enlisted in 2005 hoping for a long career in the military following in the footsteps of his two grandfathers. But all that changed on a spring day in 2012 during his third tour. While on patrol in Panjwayi Province near Kandahar in Afghanistan, Gibson knelt down on top of on an IED, which detonated. ""All I saw was red,"" he said. ""I remember everything until they put me in the helicopter."" Gibson's injuries were so severe he was kept in a medically-induced coma for two weeks.  The Army flew his wife and parents to Germany so they could say their goodbyes. Incredibly, Gibson survived. He lost both legs in the blast, and underwent 21 surgeries. While he was recovering at Walter Reed, the staff sergeant got a visit from Commander in Chief President Barack Obama. ""I was still loopy from the drugs. But I was just glaring at him, because he was hugging my wife, he was talking to my mom,"" said Gibson. ""But it didn't really register what was going on."" This year Gibson wrote the President a letter thanking him for the visit, and to tell him how far he has come since that Walter Reed visit. ""That was my worst time, and I wanted (him to know) this is everything I've done to, I guess, to better myself,"" said Gibson. His recovery has been astounding. Since his injury, he has surfed, skied, kayaked, fished, hunted, and raced in four marathons on the hand cycle. He has also gotten his private pilot's license. And he and his wife recently welcomed their first baby. ""There is life after a traumatic event and good can come of all things,"" he wrote in the letter to President Obama. Obama wrote back, and the White House invited Gibson to come as a guest to Tuesday's State of the Union. In December, Gibson, his wife, and their daughter moved into a custom built home for severely wounded veterans provided by the non-profit Homes for Our Troops. He's even got a rig to shovel his own driveway with a wheel chair powered plow. ""It's been great.  I can finally do the laundry, help out, and do the work.  I don't know if that's a good thing,"" he says with a laugh. Gibson's spirit seems truly unbreakable. ""I just want to show people there is life after a traumatic event. There's always a way to move on,"" he said.","Army Staff Sgt. Jason Gibson will be sitting in the box with first lady Michelle Obama for Tuesday's State of the Union .

"(CNN)The quest to complete the first solar-powered flight around the world moved a bit closer to reality Tuesday. Swiss pilots Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg announced the Solar Impulse 2 aircraft will depart the United Arab Emirates on their historic adventure in late February or early March, making a total of 12 planned stops. The route includes landings in Myanmar; China; India; Phoenix, Arizona; and New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. At speeds between 50 and 100 kilometers per hour (31-62 mph) Piccard and Borschberg aim to circle the globe flying about 25 days over a total of about five months. An earlier version of the plane was the first solar-powered aircraft of ""perpetual endurance"" to fly ""day and night without a drop of fuel,"" according to its website, thanks to advanced solar cells that charge light-weight lithium batteries. The batteries are able to store enough energy to allow the plane to fly long distances at night. Developers say Solar Impulse 2 takes what engineers learned from its predecessor and pushes it a step further. Compare the aircraft's wingspan to a giant Boeing 747-8: Solar Impulse 2 is 12 feet wider -- at 236 feet. And it's very lightweight, just 2½ tons, lighter than a large SUV. With just one seat, designers acknowledge Solar Impulse 2 isn't commercially practical. But that's not the point. Instead, engineers aim to demonstrate the possibilities of solar-powered aviation and to promote clean-energy technology. Soon, the plane's unique silhouette may be visible across the horizons of Southern Europe, Africa, Asia and North America. Cities on the planned route include the Chinese communities of Chongqing and Nanjing, as well as Ahmedabad and Varanasi in India. The pilots have already set a few solar aviation records. In 2010, with Borschberg in the cockpit, a previous Solar Impulse became the first manned plane to fly for 24 hours on nothing but solar-powered batteries. The team followed that up in 2012, when the plane flew from Spain to Morocco, making it the first manned sun-powered plane to fly to another continent. And in 2013, Piccard and Borschberg flew an earlier version of Solar Impulse on a mission across the United States. Piccard is a bona fide adventurer -- with world records to prove it. Decades after pioneering ultralight aircraft in the 1970s, Piccard and his colleague Brian Jones were the first to circle the earth nonstop in a balloon in 1999. Their gondola is displayed at the Smithsonian. Breaking barriers is a Piccard family tradition. His grandfather explored the stratosphere in a pressurized chamber carried by a balloon. Ten miles high, he was the first human to see the curvature of the planet with his own eyes. Piccard's father plumbed the Pacific, taking a special submarine to a record-setting depth of nearly 7 miles. Borschberg came to the project with more than two decades as a Swiss Air Force fighter pilot.","An attempt at the first solar-powered flight around the globe is set for late February .

"(CNN)The Boston doctor who was fatally shot Tuesday at Brigham and Women's Hospital had treated the mother of the gunman, according to law enforcement sources and the shooter's sister. Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said 55-year-old Stephen Pasceri of nearby Millbury came onto the second floor of the hospital, where the cardiovascular unit is located, and asked to speak with Dr. Michael Davidson. Pasceri shot Davidson when he came to the foyer between the waiting and exam rooms, according to Evans. Pasceri was found dead of what was ""clearly"" a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Evans said. Pasceri's sister, Marguerite Joly, told the Boston Herald that Davidson had performed heart surgery on their mother, Marguerite Pasceri, who died in November. ""I think it comes down to the fact that my brother thought it was the doctor's fault that my mother died,"" she told the Herald. ""I don't know why my brother would blame him. I really don't know why."" Joly said Pasceri worked at the Milford-based company Waters Corp. and had graduated from Worcester State with a degree in accounting. He had four children, she said. ""We can't even wrap our brains around this,"" she said. ""There was no indication whatsoever that he would ever do anything like this. He loved his mom, and he loved her very much. He appeared to be handling her death well."" ""I'm in shock, I can't believe it. He was such a nice a man and (he had a) beautiful family. It doesn't make any sense,"" Michelle Piselli, a neighbor of Stephen Pasceri, told CNN affiliate WHDH. ""It's hard to process."" Davidson, 44, was the director of endovascular cardiac surgery at the hospital and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, according to the hospital's website. Davidson lived in Wellesley, Massachusetts, and graduated from the Yale University School of Medicine in 1996. ""Dr. Davidson was a wonderful and inspiring cardiac surgeon who devoted his career to saving lives and improving the quality of life of every patient he cared for,"" the hospital said in a statement.  ""It is truly devastating that his own life was taken in this horrible manner."" At a new conference Wednesday, colleagues remembered Davidson as a loving father and devoted friend who played guitar in a band with other physicians. They set up the Dr. Michael J. Davidson Family Fund in his memory. Davidson's wife, Terri Halperin, also a physician, is 7 months pregnant. They have two daughters, ages 7 and 9, and a son, who is 2. One man taking his son to see a doctor said the scene at the hospital was hectic. ""There was nothing but police officers with guns drawn and everyone was yelling,"" witness James Pittelli told CNN affiliate WCVB. ""People were falling down,"" he said. ""Some were crying. It was a very surreal situation."" CNN's Tina Burnside and Lawrence Crook III contributed to this report.","The doctor, Michael Davidson, died late Tuesday evening .

The health care worker was hospitalized after a flight landed at Newark Liberty International Airport on Monday, a hospital spokeswoman said. The passenger was kept overnight at Hackensack University Medical Center for further evaluation ""in an abundance of caution,"" spokeswoman Nancy Radwin said. Luke Punzenberger, a spokesman for United, said an ill passenger was on a flight that arrived in Newark from Brussels Monday afternoon.

"(CNN)Gov. Chris Christie will make his third foreign trip since September when he travels to United Kingdom next month, venturing abroad as he prepares for what many consider a likely presidential bid. The trip, scheduled for Feb. 1-3, will include stops in London and Cambridge, where the New Jersey Republican will meet with business leaders and government officials. Clinton prepares for 2016 with staffing picks, meetings . It's being billed as an ""opportunity to strengthen economic and cultural ties between the United Kingdom and New Jersey while pursuing real opportunities in the life sciences and finance sectors,"" according to Maria Comella, Christie's deputy chief of staff for communications and planning. Christie traveled to Mexico in September and to Canada in December, where he made energy policy a big priority. ""As with all of his previous trips, this is a way for Gov. Christie to not just help grow New Jersey, but really listen and learn,"" Comella said. More details are still being worked out, but the governor is not scheduled to meet with the Queen or Prince Harry, the latter of whom toured recovered areas from Superstorm Sandy with Christie last year. News of the trip comes as Christie carries out a busy swing in the Washington-Maryland area. Before he attends Larry Hogan's inauguration ceremony Wednesday in Annapolis, Maryland, the New Jersey governor will huddle with a group of House Republicans for an informal meet and greet. Timeline: Chris Christie and Jerry Jones and why you should care . The private event, which takes places in the Capitol Hill area early Wednesday morning, is hosted by Rep. Candice Miller of Michigan and Rep. Patrick Meehan of Pennsylvania. According to her spokeswoman, Miller feels that Christie is an ""incredible leader"" and she organized Wednesday's event to get his ""insight on the future of the party."" While it's early in the Republican presidential race, Miller thinks Christie has proven that he can govern well, especially in a blue state. Miller was also involved in arranging for Christie to speak to newly elected House Republicans back in November. On Tuesday, Christie was in Northern Virginia just outside of Washington to meet with members of the local technology community at a lunch personally organized by GOP donor Bobbie Kilberg. Kilberg stressed that the event was not a fundraiser, but rather a roundtable discussion on how the technology sector affects the economy.  Christie spoke for about 15-20 minutes, she said, followed by a ""really good and robust"" discussion with the group. About 80 of the 92 attendees were CEOs or presidents of companies or organizations, including the presidents of the University of Virginia, George Washington University, Virginia Tech and Marymount University. She and Christie are friends, Kilberg said, and they've been talking about having such a meeting on technology since September, but due to the governor's busy travel schedule as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, the governor wasn't available until this month. ""So that is why it is set for now,"" Kilberg said. ""People ought to not read into it."" Christie says family can't veto 2016 decision . Separately, she said an organization that she leads -- the Northern Virginia Technology Council -- will co-host a leadership series starting in April with the Consumer Electronics Association for individuals seriously considering a presidential run. Christie said last week in a radio interview that he hasn't made a final decision yet on whether to run for president. His allies and supporters are building a leadership political action committee that will help him travel around the country in the early stages of a presidential campaign. The governor said he's urging his supporters to ""relax"" and that the quickened 2016 campaign season has not affected his planning. ""'I'm not going to allow other people to dictate to me my time frame,"" he said.","Gov. Chris Christie will visit London and Cambridge next month .

"(CNN)Two Japanese hostages, one demand from ISIS: Hand over $200 million, or else. The else being that the pair will meet the same gruesome fate as other captives held by the terrorist group, others who were shown in ISIS videos kneeling in orange jumpsuits in front of masked, black-clad men -- just like the Japanese hostages identified as Kenji Goto Jogo and Haruna Yukawa -- shortly before being beheaded. In the latest video, a masked man gives the Japanese government a choice to pay $200 million -- the same amount of money Prime Minister Shinzo Abe recently pledged for those ""contending"" with ISIS -- to free the Japanese men. That deal holds for 72 hours, which would seem to mean sometime Friday, since the video appeared on social media Tuesday. Another move that theoretically could change things would be if Japan's government halts its alliance with those fighting ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. Tokyo hasn't participated in airstrikes aimed at the Islamist extremist group, though its leaders have supported those who have, as well as the Iraqi government. ""Although you are more than 8,500 kilometers away from the Islamic State, you willingly volunteered to take part in this crusade,"" the masked man on the video posted Tuesday says, addressing his comments to Abe. But Abe, who is visiting the Middle East, didn't seem about to bargain Tuesday. He stood by a pledge, made in a speech at the weekend in Cairo, for funding to help build ""human capacities, infrastructure and so on"" for those affected by ISIS' armed campaign. ""The pledge aid is very important to the refugees in need and has nothing to do with the Islamic communities or the radical militants,"" the Prime Minister said. ""... We will contribute to the (region's) peace and stability, in cooperation with the global community."" As to the ISIS threat against two of his nation's citizens, Abe called it ""unacceptable."" ""I feel angry about it,"" he said. ""I strongly urge them to immediately release the hostages without harming them."" ISIS has asked for ransoms before, and apparently has been paid them. But rarely are such demands made publicly. Even rarer -- unprecedented, in fact -- is when the militant group puts its captives on video and threatens them, then lets them go. Instead, ISIS has made a public show out of its threatening and killings of Western hostages, starting with August's beheading of U.S. journalist James Foley. Others' killings were similarly recorded and posted online, including American journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, British taxi driver Alan Henning and U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig. While not participating in ground combat, both the United States and Great Britain have taken an active role in the anti-ISIS fight with airstrikes and training, arming and otherwise supporting groups -- such as Iraq's military, Kurdish fighters and moderate Syrian opposition -- taking on the militants face-to-face. That's not the case for Japan, whose post-World War II constitution allows it to use its military only for self-defense. But Tokyo is a strong ally with Western powers, such as the United States, that have been singled out by ISIS. In his remarks Tuesday in Jerusalem, Abe -- who dealt with another hostage crisis involving Islamic militants in January 2013, when 10 Japanese citizens were caught up in the terrorist seizure of a natural gas facility in Algeria -- said he had ordered Japanese officials to do the utmost to try to save the two men. At the same time, the Prime Minister added, ""Terrorists should not be forgiven, for any reason. I criticize (the taking of hostages) emphatically."" The aim is to safely bring home two men who were in the same war-torn region for very different reasons. Like Foley and Sotloff, Goto went there to help tell the story of what was happening in Iraq and Syria. In recent months, ISIS militants have managed to take over vast swaths of both countries, ruthlessly going after many in their way who don't share their extremist interpretation of Islam. The ISIS video refers to him as ""Kenji Goto Jogo,"" but on his Twitter handle -- and a photograph accredited to him -- he's just called Kenji Goto. The freelance journalist reported for various Japanese news organizations about the situation in the northern Syrian battleground city of Kobani, which for weeks has been under siege by ISIS, and other areas. While it's not known when he was taken captive, Goto's last Twitter post was on October 23. The man purportedly shown along with him, Yukawa, is believed to have been captured in Syria in August while traveling with rebel fighters, according to the Japanese news agency Kyodo. The 42-year-old claimed to have set up a company in Tokyo providing armed security services and posted videos online of his activities in Iraq and Syria. But a report by the news agency Reuters in August portrayed him as a lost soul, who went to the Middle East searching for a purpose after losing his wife, his business and his home over the previous decade. Kyodo reported previously that Japanese officials in Jordan had being trying to secure his release, including talking to various groups with possible connections to his captors. Abe spoke firmly Tuesday against the terrorists and their $200 million ransom demand. What he did not do, however, is rule out the Japanese government paying ransom or negotiating with its two citizens' captors. Like most countries, Japan has never advertised that it or Japanese companies have paid ransom for hostages. In fact, Japanese government officials have at times denied such a practice, and Japan is a signatory to a 2013 G8 communique that stated, ""We unequivocally reject the payment of ransoms to terrorists, and we call on countries and companies around the world to follow our lead to stamp this out."" One reason for this policy is that ISIS and groups like it can use ransoms to fund their bloody campaigns. Paying ransoms also may give them incentive to take more hostages, thus putting more people at risk. And ransoms might not always work, since ISIS and other hostage takers aren't usually seen as trustworthy. Still, ruling out ransoms also rules out one peaceful way to free Goto and Yukawa. It's possible someone else may intervene to negotiate their release, whether out of goodwill or in exchange for something else. Or troops from a Japanese ally could launch a raid to get to them, like the unsuccessful one this summer to free Foley. Either way, others could play a role in this story before it's done -- hence Abe's comment Tuesday that the international community ""needs to deal with terrorists without giving in to them.""

"President Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi are steering clear of competitive House districts but Republicans are still making sure their presence is felt. The president and House Democratic leader are star players in television commercials the GOP is pumping into these districts in the final stretch before the midterm elections. It's not surprising that the GOP is tying the president, whose approval ratings are at records lows, to vulnerable House and Senate Democrats. But Pelosi's image pops up even more than the president's in the latest round of Republican campaign ads targeting Democratic incumbents and challengers. One senior House GOP strategist tells CNN that while Obama is unpopular, their internal polls show that Pelosi remains even more ""toxic."" Obama on the airwaves . On Tuesday, the National Republican Congressional Committee unveiled a new television commercial attacking West Virginia Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall that includes a video clip of Obama declaring that even though he's not on the ballot his policies are on, ""every single one of them."" The narrator concludes ""a vote for Nick Rahall is a vote for the Obama agenda."" A similar spot is airing in Georgia, where the NRCC also uses the president's image adjacent to that of Democratic Rep. John Barrow several times in thirty seconds. The president served up another line for the GOP ad makers on Monday in an interview with MSNBC host Al Sharpton.  Obama conceded that campaigning with fellow Democrats in these competitive areas might only help energize Republican turnout.  But he didn't help those Democrats wanting to keep him at arm's length by saying, ""the bottom line is that these are all folks that vote with me. They have supported my agenda in Congress."" GOP's familiar strategy: tie Democrats to Pelosi . Pelosi, like the president, has focused her energy traveling to high ticket fundraisers in cities like New York, San Francisco, Washington, DC, and Los Angeles, rather appearing at public events in competitive House districts. POLL: Georgia Senate race statistically tied . But if you turn on the TV in many of those districts, Pelosi's image is front and center.  Out of the dozen new ads released by the NRCC on Tuesday, seven specifically show Pelosi right next to the Democratic candidates.  And these ads come after a barrage of similar spots that ran last month from both the NRCC and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Republican strategy is not new.  Ever since Pelosi joined House leadership ranks, she has become a familiar face in Republican campaign commercials. The GOP effort to tie every swing district Democrat to Pelosi - who they often label as a ""San Francisco liberal"" -- reached its peak in the 2010 midterms.  During that election, House Republicans made ousting Pelosi from the Speaker's chair their cause.  Over $65 million was spent on ads that specifically targeted Pelosi,  according to analysis of TV ads for CNN by Campaign Media Analysis Group after that election.  House Democrats lost 63 seats and control of the House. In the 2012 election the NRCC and other GOP groups again used Pelosi's image, often next to Obama's, since he was at the top of the ticket. Even though Pelosi isn't as big of a threat since her leadership position is diminished, GOP strategists say she is still well known, and they believe she maintains a partisan impression with voters that can hurt Democratic candidates. The new round of NRCC-funded campaign ads showcases the anti-Pelosi theme. Minnesota Democratic Rep. Colin Peterson is criticized for supporting ""Nancy Pelosi's energy tax.""  A picture of Iowa Democratic candidate Staci Appel is placed next to one of Pelosi as the NRCC ad denounces Appel's support of ""big government."" Pelosi also appears in an NRCC ad against Florida Democratic candidate Gwen Graham that highlights Graham's support of Obamacare. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a group with ties to House Speaker John Boehner, unveiled a new series of half a dozen ads this week that also prominently use pictures of Pelosi. The GOP group's television spot says Arizona Democratic Rep Ron Barber, will ""take your vote and give it to Nancy Pelosi"" and emphasizes that California Democratic Rep """"Ami Bera voted with Nancy Pelosi to support Obamacare."" Pelosi isn't surprised by the tactic, and in fact she appears to welcomes it.  Last month she called the move ""desperate"" and argued it was proof that Republicans ""have no ideas."" But the Democratic Leader also smiled and noted that when Republicans made it about her, ""they help me raise money every single day!"" Fundraising records do show Pelosi has brought in an impressive haul over this election cycle.  As of September, Pelosi raised over $80 million for Democrats this election cycle - more than the $65 million she raised in the fall before the 2012 election.  Her office said that she personally has raised more than one third of the $163 million that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raised for the 2014 midterms.","President Obama not on campaign trail but on airwaves .

"For the world's two largest economies -- and largest emitters of greenhouse gas -- to announce a sustained commitment to reducing carbon emissions by almost a third by the year 2030 is a watershed moment for climate politics on so many fronts. Firstly, it raises the tempo worldwide regarding just how seriously we should be listening to the science and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Secondly, it provides a new benchmark for international negotiations to break the lethargy we have seen at climate summits over the past decade. The realization of real and effective multilateral action has lacked political will, insofar as the largest emitters have not shown the kind of initiative needed to inspire the rest of the world. For this reason, this announcement may be a game changer for the Paris climate talks next year. Already on the table for that meeting is the EU's commitment to cut emissions by 40% of 1990 levels, but with China and the U.S. weighing in, multilateral momentum will likely shift from incremental to dynamic. Anyone skeptical that the Sino-U.S. announcement is without substance ought to consider that it is the culmination of nine months of secret talks, and has involved leadership right up to the countries' respective presidential offices. The increased global spotlight on China's climate policies will change international despair on climate. It is true that China surpassed the U.S. as the world's largest emitter in 2007, but it is disingenuous to simply caricature China as a rogue state that is out of control with its energy consumption. As the workshop of the world, China became a freight train of industrial growth before emissions reduction was on anyone's radar. Its emissions are not ""domestic"" in the way we usually measure carbon pollution, as it is developed nations which put the immense demands on China's energy sector. To meet these demands, China is burning more fossil fuels than anyone else, but it has also made the greatest leaps forward with renewables. China invests more annually in its renewable energy sector than the whole of the EU. It has now surpassed Germany with the largest domestic solar sector, and surpassed the U.S. in domestic wind power. According to a Lowy Institute report, the Chinese leadership has been frustrated in the past with the slow political inertia of international negotiations, which makes this announcement all the more significant. So all eyes will now be turning to the G20 summit on the weekend. With so many meetings of world leaders in quick succession, the opportunity for building momentum on global climate solutions has never been better. But it remains to be seen whether this breakthrough announcement will have an impact on the G20 meeting, as host Australia has been trying to keep climate off the agenda for all year. As an economic meeting, the G20 cannot afford to ignore the restructuring of energy markets and productive capacity that will be needed to accommodate these very ambitious cuts propose by China, the U.S. and EU. Australia has become a pariah state on climate since the election of Prime Minister Tony Abbott's government last year. With statements from Abbott as recently as last month that ""coal is good for humanity,"" Australia has been ridiculed in the international press as a regressive government that sees climate mitigation as incompatible with economic growth. Australia has been identified as the only country on Earth to be winding back national climate legislation -- a Globe International assessment on the effectiveness of decarbonization policies of 66 countries placed Australia at the bottom of the list. On hearing of the China-U.S. announcement, the Australian opposition leader Bill Shorten commented: ""Now this gigantic news has been announced at APEC four days before the G20, the Australian government needs to join the rest of the world.""","U.S., China announce historic climate deal to cut carbon emissions .

Yet we know what needs to be done, for example, to end the Ebola disaster, halt climate change, rid our world of hunger and begin the difficult process of healing deep divisions in our societies. Our failure is not because of a lack of knowledge or global resources but leadership and resolve -- by politicians but also throughout society. How we put this right must be at the heart of all discussions at Davos this week. Let's start with Ebola. We have known about this disease for 40 years, how deadly it is, how it is transmitted and how to prevent infection. Yet we have lost thousands of lives already to the epidemic in West Africa and only now have the resources, from within countries and outside, been mobilized to halt it. We need to learn the lessons and ensure we can move much more quickly and effectively before such deadly diseases take hold. The last few months have also underlined the need for big pharma to invest more into the research of diseases that occur in poorer countries. The extraordinary progress in tackling some of the world's greatest killers through the development and distribution of vaccines shows what can be achieved through our collective efforts. Second, Africa, with the world's most uncultivated arable land, has the potential to help end the global food security and nutrition crisis. Yet it fails to grow enough food even to feed its own people. Africa's governments have recognised their responsibility to put in place the policies and investments which will enable the continent's farmers, big and small, to provide the food needed. They must deliver the improved infrastructure which is vital to this ambition. Business must respond as well, particularly by giving small-holder farmers the access to new crop varieties, techniques and markets. The third area where leadership is absolutely crucial is the climate crisis. How is it possible that climate change conferences continually fail to provide the breakthrough given that the science is so clear about the threat to future generations and our planet? In December, a global agreement must be reached in Paris on the framework and policies needed to halt climate change. Political leaders need to look beyond the next electoral cycle. Civil society has largely already understood what needs to be done. I believe corporations will quickly respond to the challenge as many already have. There can be no clearer example of where our common values must be rediscovered. There are welcome signs that this is, at last, beginning to be understood. Fourthly, we know that successful peace processes are our only chance of escaping the circle of violence. Without the resolve to address the past openly, and without leaders showing the courage to give peace commissions the independence they need, solutions will be haphazard. It takes courage to address the rights of victims genuinely, but it is fundamental to heal wounds permanently. In a world riddled with conflict, this courage will be more essential than ever. The international community needs to do more to support countries through this often difficult process. Finally, there is also an urgent need to step up support for democracy and elections. While almost every country now votes, public faith in democracy is on the wane. In too many countries, political leaders manipulate the process to deny their citizens a proper voice.  Even in mature democracies, there is an increasingly widespread belief that elections change little and that the political elite serve only their only narrow interests. Leaders in 2015 will once more have the choice between using elections to give their regimes a veneer of democratic legitimacy or ensuring a level-playing field, respecting the secrecy of the ballot and, above all, accept the result peacefully. Last year's successful Presidential elections and peaceful hand-over of power in Indonesia, the world's third largest democracy, even when the result was very close provided real hope for the future.  Supporting the integrity of elections in Africa and elsewhere will be an area, like all these challenges, I and my Foundation sees as particular priorities this year. In times of uncertainty, it is all too easy to surrender to fear and retreat, look inward and think short-term. But what is urgently needed is the ability in politics but also in business and society as a whole to look beyond national borders, the next election or set of quarterly results. This must underpin not just discussions at Davos but all our actions as voters, citizens and consumers in the coming months and years. Read more of CNN's coverage from Davos 2015 .

"(CNN)From a distance this may look like an ordinary tree, but get closer and you will discover it is actually a power generator. French company NewWind has created the ""Arbre a Vent"" or ""Wind Tree,"" a 3-meter-tall generator designed for urban environments which makes the most of smaller air currents. Operating in near complete silence, the wind tree consists of 72 micro turbine ""aeroleaves"" that rotate in the wind, generating an estimated 3.1. kW of power. While this isn't much compared to industrial-sized turbines, which typically generate in the region of 1 - 3MW, having multiple smaller turbines has its uses. ""Urban wind is not very strong, but it is very turbulent,"" says ""Arbre à Vent"" engineer Julia Revuz. ""These turbines need less wind to get started and produce around 3kW of energy, which could heat a small home, fuel lights or charge an electric car."" NewWind was founded by Jérôme Michaud-Larivière three years ago when he had the idea for the Wind Tree while taking a walk. He saw the leaves on a tree moving in the wind and started thinking about the possibility of turning that kinetic energy into electricity. The current prototype of the tree is steel and the energy made from it goes into the electricity grid and is used locally. ""We haven't yet optimized the structure,"" says Revuz. ""We are hoping to make the leaves out of eco-friendly materials and for the tree to have as a low a carbon footprint as possible."" A 12-meter tall prototype of the tree will be on display from March 12 for two months at Place de la Concorde, a major public square in Paris. This prototype, which weighs around 5 tons and costs roughly $35,000, is to be used as an educational tool and will aim to show the public the technology behind the structure. The wind tree will be mass produced for sale from March 2015 and NewWind says it has raised €1.15 million ($1.34 million) to begin pre-production. ""The reaction has been very positive so far,"" explains Revuz. ""People don't know how it works but they like it, they find it magical. ""There is a very negative view of wind energy, people think it's ugly and it ruins their landscapes. Then they see the wind tree and they think differently."" NewWind has had interest from local government in France and Europe, as well as real estate agents and businesses that want to have the tree on their land. There are even talks about another demonstration tree in London next year. The Wind Tree may not be affordable and practical for everyone, but there are other applications that could be more accessible. ""Our technology is in the mini wind turbines (the aeroleaves),"" says Revuz. ""So we are developing other applications for them. ""Architects have been in touch and are interested in using them in their work, perhaps on the roofs of buildings. Mini turbines are cheaper to produce and buy than the wind tree."" Other ideas for the aeroleaves include rooftop foliage installed on buildings, foliage on roadsides and the smart balcony -- where the mini turbines are attached to balcony railings. However innovative, this is not the first urban energy source inspired by nature -- check out the ""Power Flower"" and others in the gallery above.

"(CNN)The only man charged in the 2010 disappearance and death of honor student Phylicia Barnes has been freed by a judge in Baltimore. On Monday, Judge Addison Howard granted a motion of acquittal for Michael Johnson because of insufficient evidence. Russell Barnes, Phylicia Barnes' father, said the ruling was heartbreaking. ""I feel like I got run over by a train,"" he said. The body of the 16-year-old Barnes was found floating in a Maryland river in spring 2011. Authorities said she was found without clothes and with no ""overt"" signs of wounds or injuries. The teen had been visiting her half-sister in Baltimore. She said she was going out to get something to eat and maybe a haircut when she left the residence. About a year after her body was found, police arrested Johnson, the half-sister's ex-boyfriend. Johnson was convicted of second degree murder in January 2013. But his attorneys successfully argued that he should have a new trial because the prosecution withheld evidence about a witness who linked Johnson to the killing, according to the judge's order that summarized the case. Last month, the second trial ended in a mistrial because the jury was allowed to hear information in recordings that should have been redacted, the court order stated. Defense lawyers filed a motion for acquittal. The judge's order said there was plenty of circumstantial evidence against Johnson, including that he was the last person known to see Barnes and that a witness watched him sweating as he carried an object in a tote down the apartment stairs on the day she disappeared. However, the judge wrote, ""there was insufficient evidence when taken as a whole"" to convict Johnson on a charge of second-degree murder. Prosecutors tweeted a statement saying they disagree with the judge's decision and will appeal the ruling. Defense lawyer Kay Beehler issued a statement saying, ""This case was a tragedy for everyone in the Barnes and Johnson families. Ms. Barnes was a lovely, vibrant young woman.  However, Mr. Johnson has maintained his innocence from Day One of this entire case, and we are very thankful that justice was done. "" Johnson left jail and was met by reporters on the street. ""It feels great to be out,"" he said. Russell Barnes said he'll keep working to put Johnson behind bars. ""We just can't let this go,"" he said. ""We have to see justice for Phylicia. We're just going to pursue ... the same gentlemen, a child killer who's on the streets of Baltimore.""

"Paris (CNN)Lassana Bathily, who emerged as the hero of the Paris supermarket attack, received his new French passport from the hands of Prime Minister Manuel Valls and Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve at a ceremony in Paris. The French government decided to award citizenship to the Malian-born 24-year-old supermarket employee after he risked his own life to hide customers from hostage-taker Amedy Coulibaly earlier this month. Four people lost their lives in the hostage-taking and shooting at the kosher grocery store. But the 15 people whom Bathily led downstairs to hide in a walk-in freezer stayed safe. Bathily, who describes himself as a ""practicing Muslim,"" told CNN affiliate BFMTV he switched off the freezer, turned off the lights and told everyone to stay calm. He went upstairs, following orders from the hostage-taker, but managed to run outside and tell police about the situation in the store. In his opening speech  at the ceremony Tuesday evening, Cazeneuve praised Bathily's gesture ""of courage and humanity"" which had become ""the symbol of an Islam of peace and tolerance."" Bathily, who arrived in France when he was 16, had dreamed of gaining French citizenship since his childhood. ""Today, this dream is becoming true, a bit faster than expected,"" Cazeneuve said. Valls also paid tribute to the courage of the young man. ""With you and with all the people in this room,"" the Prime Minister said, ""we just saw one of the most beautiful images of our country."" Valls also recalled the strong ties between France and Mali, a ""country which saw Timbuktu being wrecked by terrorists,"" and which received French support in its fight against jihadism. The French military has been involved in fighting Islamist extremists in Mali and the wider Sahel region since early 2013. Both Valls and Cazeneuve emphasized the importance of keeping French citizenship open in order to remain faithful to the Republican ideal. ""Welcoming new French citizens is an opportunity for the country as well as for those who become French,"" Valls said. Bathily then took the floor. ""I thank you with all my heart for awarding me French citizenship. I am proud and moved,"" the young man said. ""People think I am a hero, but I am not. I am just Lassana."" At the end of the ceremony, Bathily received his passport together with a letter from President Francois Hollande and the ""citizenship kit"" distributed to all new French citizens. Coulibaly, the terrorist killed in the police operation that ended the supermarket attack, also had roots in Mali. But, unlike Bathily, he was born in France and had French citizenship.","France awards citizenship to Lassana Bathily for his actions during the supermarket attack .

"(CNN)Dueling official Republican responses to Tuesday's State of the Union address meant to highlight the party's alternate vision for the nation instead underscored the GOP's deep divide on immigration reform. One, given in Spanish by Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo, asked the President to ""cooperate"" with congressional Republicans to make immigration reform happen. ""We should also work through the appropriate channels to create permanent solutions for our immigration system, to secure our borders, modernize legal immigration, and strengthen our economy,"" Curbelo said in Spanish. ""In the past, the President has expressed support for ideas like these. Now we ask him to cooperate with us to get it done."" The other, delivered in English by Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, made no mention of reform. She gave a folksy pitch for Republican proposals to improve the economy, overhaul the tax code and open up new trade markets abroad. While Curbelo and Ernst were the two officially-sanctioned GOP responses, a cacophony of Republicans spanning the ideological spectrum gave their own rebuttals throughout the night. House Republicans had said Curbelo would be delivering a Spanish translation of Ernst's speech in a press release that went out last week, but by Wednesday morning, that note had been deleted from the release. Curbelo told Politico he requested a copy of Ernst's prepared remarks and revised them to reflect his own priorities, and that GOP Leadership had okayed his version of the speech. ""I did not get any pushback whatsoever,"" he said. The freshman House Republican said it was ""a shame that Democrats would try to criticize us for each of us having our own priorities and ideas and making them known."" ""I think leadership should be commended for encouraging those it selects to talk about their lives, their priorities and their vision,"" he said. But the clash between the two speeches reflects the broader struggle within the party to expand its appeal beyond base conservatives and into untapped demographic groups, particularly minorities. With America's Latino population growing exponentially, Republican leaders have openly admitted they won't be able to compete on the national stage if they can't figure out how to narrow Democrats' advantage with that voting bloc. South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has expressed interest in a presidential bid, told CNN last month that it would be ""difficult, if not impossible"" for the GOP to win the White House in 2016 without passing immigration reform. Many in the party's right flank, however, remain staunchly opposed to any reform proposals that include a pathway to citizenship for immigrants here illegally, which conservatives decry as ""amnesty."" Ernst herself was a loud opponent of a pathway to citizenship during her campaign, and said she would've opposed the 2013 Senate reform bill for that reason. Curbelo, meanwhile, supported that bill during his campaign and bucked Republicans on a pair of amendments meant to block President Obama's executive action on amnesty last week, voting against them. But both Republicans hail from competitive swing states, and represent voting blocs that could be key to the GOP's hopes of winning the White House in 2016. Their disconnect on the immigration reform issue suggests the party still has a ways to go in bridging the gulf between the two.","Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst and Florida Rep.

"(CNN)His voice, his posture and his threats are menacingly familiar. The black-clad ISIS militant shown in a video demanding a $200 million ransom to spare the lives of two Japanese citizens looks and sounds similar to the man who has appeared in at least five previous hostage videos. The knife-wielding masked man with a London accent, nicknamed ""Jihadi John,"" has issued threats and overseen the beheadings of American and British captives. ""You now have 72 hours to pressure your government in making a wise decision, by paying the $200 million to save the lives of your citizens,"" the man in the video that appeared Tuesday says in comments addressed to Japanese citizens. ""Otherwise, this knife will become your nightmare."" Q&A: Harsh realities of kidnappings, ransom . The amount of money is the same as that recently pledged by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in humanitarian aid to Middle East countries that are affected by ISIS' bloody campaign in Iraq and Syria. Japan believes the deadline arrives Friday at 12:50 a.m. ET. And Chief Cabinet Minister Yoshihide Suga said Wednesday the country will do its best to communicate with ISIS through a third-party nation. But mystery and confusion still surround the identity of Jihadi John. U.S. and British officials have said they believe they know who he is, but they haven't disclosed the information publicly. That could be because Western intelligence agencies believe they have more to gain from keeping quiet, says Aki Peritz, a former CIA officer. ""They can put pressure on his family, put pressure on his friends,"" he told CNN. ""Maybe they have a line to him. Maybe they know who his cousins are who are going to Syria who can identify him. However, if you publicly tell everybody who he is, his real identity, then maybe he'll go to ground and he'll disappear."" There had been reports that Jihadi John was injured in a bombing attack by the U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition. But the video that appeared Tuesday would suggest, if it's really the same person, that he's alive and well enough to make a death threat accompanied by a demand for money. His apparent reappearance helps ISIS' slick propaganda machine, which is used by the extremist group to raise money and recruit followers. ""It shows them resilient -- that they're able to film this video with these Japanese hostages outside in broad daylight somewhere presumably in Syria,"" said CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank. Five months and roughly 2,000 airstrikes after ISIS' video of the killing of U.S. journalist James Foley, why does one of the West's most prominent tormentors appear to still be at liberty? U.S. and British military and intelligence officials declined to comment on the matter. Experts say the problem lies in the extreme difficulty of infiltrating commandos into Syria to reach Jihadi John. ""ISIS operates in what we call denied territory,"" said Cedric Leighton, a retired U.S. Air Force colonel.  ""And that means by definition, that it's very hard for our folks to get in there, it's very hard for them to actually lay eyes on target."" A mission by U.S. special operations forces in July failed to find Foley and other hostages in Syria. ""The attempt to rescue Mr. Foley is one of the things that has now made the White House very reluctant to act aggressively,"" said Tony Shaffer, a former U.S. intelligence operative, who directed special operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. A senior U.S. administration official, however, said the U.S. government is ""actively pursuing justice"" for the slayings of the hostages. ""The FBI has an open criminal investigation, and as you have seen, we will hold terrorists like this accountable, no matter how long it takes,"" the official said on condition of anonymity. ""For operational security reasons, we are not in a position to detail all of the steps we are undertaking."" Meanwhile, as ISIS' deadline draws nearer, the Japanese government has to decide how it will respond to the extremists' latest life-or-death ultimatum.","Western officials have said they believe they know the identity of ""Jihadi John""

"(CNN)It's a major European waterway that rivals the Volga, the Rhine and the Danube. Now, deadly fighting in Ukraine has transformed the Dnieper into something much more than a river. It has become a cultural symbol of a deeply divided nation. Along its winding path — and elsewhere — Polish photojournalist Justyna Mielnikiewicz met people whose lives have been profoundly changed since fighting erupted last year between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russia rebels. Despite a shaky ceasefire, which was reached last September, sporadic fighting continues. ""I'm trying to show the amazing unbroken spirit of people which are united and determined to fight for what they believe,"" Mielnikiewicz told CNN on the phone this week. Her camera captured fascinating people linked to the conflict: a masked fighter brandishing a piece of wood shaped like a rifle, children wearing paramilitary uniforms standing at attention, a young couple dramatically embracing in the midst of an intense protest. Mielnikiewicz also photographed landscapes reflecting the mood of the region: a cable car suspended over the mighty Dnieper, giant concrete wave-breakers blocking a road, and a protest billboard depicting Russian President Vladimir Putin wearing a Hitler-style mustache. The Dnieper basically slices Ukraine into two parts — east and west — as it flows roughly north to south connecting the capital, Kiev, to the Black Sea. The farther east of the river you go, residents tend to lean toward pro-Russia rebels. The farther west of the river, people are more likely to support the government. ""I'm trying to keep a wider perspective,"" Mielnikiewicz said, mindful that although the fighting has been limited to relatively small regions, it has very much affected people nationwide. Before the ceasefire, an August report from the United Nations said at least 2,220 people had been killed since mid-April 2014. At least 5,956 had been wounded, the report said, not including the 298 victims of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17, which was shot down over the region in July. Russia annexed Ukraine's semi-autonomous region of Crimea in March, supported by Crimea's ethnic Russian majority. Putin said Russia was protecting Crimea. But international opponents called it a land grab and slapped Russia with economic sanctions. Photographing people in war-torn countries wasn't what Mielnikiewicz had in mind when she first envisioned her career. She said she started as a ""very socially engaged person in general"" who aspired to become a painter. ""In a sense, photography can combine those two things,"" she said. ""You can be a socially engaged artist — being a photographer. What interests me in photography is it can be a tool to be able to talk to people — to discover their stories — to tell their stories."" She trained to become a film critic, she said. But eventually Mielnikiewicz knew she wanted to watch dramatic events unfold in real life, instead of on the silver screen. Her Ukraine photos won Mielnikiewicz a grant from the U.S.-based Aftermath Project, which encourages photographers to tell stories about the aftermath of conflict. She hopes she'll be able to return to Ukraine this year, to reunite with the people she met and see how their lives have changed. The ceasefire, Mielnikiewicz said, doesn't seem to be working well. And the fighting? ""It doesn't look like there's an end to it."" Nonetheless, she said she's discovered firsthand something that Ukrainians seem to share. ""The strength of Ukraine is really amazing — the determination,"" she said. ""Not just talking about the war, I think they're a very strong people.""

"(CNN)As thousands-strong anti-Islamization rallies make headlines in Germany following the Charlie Hebdo attack, one of the rallies' organizers has resigned as leader of a right-wing group after a newspaper published a months-old selfie of him posing as Adolf Hitler. The photo shows Lutz Bachmann, leader of PEGIDA, which translates in English to Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West. It appeared Wednesday on the cover of German tabloid BILD. Bachmann resigned as chairman of the group following the backlash to the Hitler photo, as well as another image Bachmann posted of a man in a Ku Klux Klan robe with the caption, ""Three K's a day keeps the minorities away."" ""I apologize to everybody who has felt attacked by my online postings. They were comments made without serious reflection, which I would no longer express today. I am sorry that I thereby damaged the interests of our movement, and draw the appropriate conclusion,"" Bachmann said in Dresden. The selfie was an act of satire, his spokeswoman Kathrin Oertel said on Facebook. While every citizen has the right to engage in satire, she wrote, insulting foreigners is not satirical. Though Bachmann apparently has deleted his own Facebook account, screen grabs published by numerous media outlets suggest Bachmann posted the Hitler photo in September, while the KKK image is from 2012. Bachmann told BILD, ""I took the photo at the hairdressers, for the publication of the audiobook of the satire 'He's Back.' ... You need to be able to joke about things now and then."" ""He's back,"" or ""Er ist wieder da"" in German, is a 2012 best-selling satire based on Hitler waking up in modern-day Berlin with no knowledge of what happened following World War II. The audiobook was released long before September, as January 2013 news reports indicate 75,000 copies had already been sold. It appears the images gained traction not because of timeliness but because PEGIDA has successfully organized weekly anti-Islamization demonstrations in Dresden. Police estimated that 18,000 people attended a January 5 rally, while about 25,000 people showed up at a January 12 rally. Monday's scheduled protest in Dresden was canceled after police persuaded PEGIDA to call it off following an ISIS fatwa targeting PEGIDA's organizers, the group wrote on the Facebook page for its United Kingdom branch. ""The police has canceled the rally in agreement with PEGIDA because they can't guarantee the security and safety of participants after information of planned attacks by islamistic groups,"" the Facebook post said. In response to Monday's cancellation, LEGIDA, the city of Leipzig's offshoot of PEGIDA, said it was organizing a rally expected to draw between 30,000 and 60,000 demonstrators, according to German media. As many as 4,000 police officers had been recruited from around the country in preparation for the event, one news outlet reported. On its main Facebook page, which has more than 155,000 ""likes,"" PEGIDA has stated its philosophy that citizens should ""wake from their slumber"" and recognize the ""danger in the Islamic ideology."" ""Stop the radical Salafists' Islamization,"" it urges. ""As a society, we should give people the chance to integrate, but we should not allow ourselves to be Islamized thereby losing our freedom and democracy!"" The group claims to have supporters in more than 30 German cities and 18 countries in Europe. A PEGIDA group in Norway also called for demonstrators to gather outside Town Hall in the capital, Oslo, earlier this month to show support for the French and demonstrate opposition to what it calls the ""Islamification of Norway."" German Justice Minister Heiko Maas and Chancellor Angela Merkel have called on the group to cancel the rallies in Dresden and other German cities. Counterprotests have taken place or been planned in Hanover, Düsseldorf, Hamburg, Munich, Dresden, Leipzig and Berlin. During a January 5 demonstration, Germany's Cologne Cathedral turned off its lights in a symbolic rejection of the rally taking place in its shadow. Joerg Forbrig, a European analyst with the German Marshall Fund of the United States, told CNN that the PEGIDA's message resonated only in the Dresden area, where its ideas had fallen on ""particularly fertile soil."" ""These protests are not so much fueled by fear of Islam and fear of Islamist attacks, but by frustration at the cost of reunification -- about the way they are being integrated and represented since the fall of the Berlin Wall,"" Forbrig said. Dresden already had a well-established network of right-wing extremists before PEGIDA's emergence, he said. ""It's more a case of East Germans not entirely feeling at home in Germany,"" Forbrig said. ""There is a feeling of second-class citizenship, and in order to be heard, many East Germans take to radical measures."" CNN's Rick Noack and Susannah Cullinane contributed to this report.","Leader of anti-Islamization group said he took Hitler photo as ""joke"" to coincide with audiobook release .

"(CNN)Brazilian surf star Ricardo dos Santos has died after reportedly being shot by an off-duty police officer. Heartbroken tributes poured in from the 24-year-old's surfing peers. ""An incredible human being!"" wrote Carlos Burle, another top Brazilian surfer, in a post on Instagram. He said dos Santos had ""a whole life ahead of him."" ""RIP Ricardo dos Santos.

Dos Santos was ""a fearless, world-class tuberider"" who ""captured the surf world's attention"" at the 2012 Billabong Pro event in Tahiti, according to Surfer magazine. The off-duty police officer shot dos Santos three times in the chest Monday after the two had an argument in front of the surfer's family home in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina, according to CNN affiliate Record News. Doctors carried out surgery four times to try to save him, the broadcaster reported. As his life hung in the balance, many of his friends and fans took to social media, pulling for him to make a recovery. Some urged people to make blood donations. ""We're all together with you, brother,"" Burle wrote on Instagram. But the doctors couldn't stop the bleeding. Dos Santos died Tuesday. ""We need to pray and thank God for the time he lived among us,"" his father said. ""A great athlete, he was an example."" The police officer suspected in the shooting, identified as Luis Paulo Mota Brentano, has been arrested but says he shot the surfer in self-defense, according to Record News. Many in the surfing community found it hard to grasp what had happened.

"(CNN)The Chinese are coming -- to European football -- and billionaire Wang Jianlin hopes his decision to invest $52 million for a 20% stake in Spanish champion Atletico Madrid (ATM) will open doors for China's best players. ""This investment will not only provide a golden opportunity for young Chinese players sent overseas by Wanda to be selected by leading European football clubs, it will also strengthen the quality of Chinese football and narrow the gap between the rest of the world,"" Wang said Wednesday.

"Cap Haitien, Haiti (CNN) -- Haiti's government appeared Tuesday to have lost control of Cap Haitien, where demonstrators angry over what they see as the United Nations' role in starting the ongoing cholera epidemic controlled many of the streets for a second consecutive day. At the airport in the country's second-largest city, commercial flights were suspended Tuesday. Police were not wearing uniforms in an apparent attempt to elude the wrath of Haitians, who had torched at least one police station on Monday. The only way to get from the airport into town was by motorcycle. Barricades composed of burning tires and vehicles blocked cars from traveling on many of the roads. As the sun set, smoke from the many fires mixed with tear gas fired by peacekeepers, and hovered over the city. The office of Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive had said early in the day that it was sending a delegation of government ministers by helicopter from the capital city of Port-au-Prince to Cap Haitien in an attempt to orchestrate a return to order, but by nightfall they were not visible. In Cap Haitien, at least one demonstrator was killed in riots Monday by a U.N. peacekeeper. At a hotel, guests were hunkered down, unwilling to brave the chaos of the streets. The focus of the the Haitians' ire centers on their contention that the cholera outbreak blamed for more than 1,000 deaths was started when untreated sewage from a Nepalese contingent of peacekeepers entered the water supply. That assertion has been denied by the United Nations. Protesters have demanded that the U.N. forces pull out of Haiti. Cap Haitien is in Haiti's North Department, which has had the nation's highest rate of cholera deaths. Of the 1,578 people hospitalized in the department from cholera, 119 have died. The 7.5 percent death rate is the nation's highest, according to figures released Tuesday by the Ministry of Public Health. The U.N. stabilization mission in Haiti charged that the riots may be politically motivated in advance of elections set for November 28. ""The way in which the events unfolded leads to the belief that the incidents had a political motivation, aimed at creating a climate of insecurity on the eve of the elections,"" the U.N. mission, known by the acronym MINUSTAH, said in a statement Tuesday. ""MINUSTAH calls on the population to remain vigilant and not let itself be manipulated by the enemies of stability and democracy in the country,"" the statement said. Imogen Wall, a spokeswoman for the United Nations, said at least one U.N. warehouse has been looted and that a flight that was to have carried cholera supplies intended for Cap Haitien was suspended. ""Cap Haitien is very serious for cholera right now,"" she said. ""You can't run cholera response in this atmosphere."" In the town of Hinche, northeast of the capital, about 400 demonstrators protested the peacekeepers, six of whom were injured, said Vincenzo Pugliese, a spokesman for MINUSTAH. ""This is a situation that began with a child who was in agony with cholera,"" said Lesley Voltaire, a former minister of education and presidential candidate who was campaigning for the upcoming elections. ""They were calling ambulances and MINUSTAH but nobody came. The kid died in front of many people and made the people furious."" Voltaire insisted the protests were spontaneous. ""The Nepalese [peacekeepers] are their target,"" added Voltaire, who said he was stranded at a local hotel overnight after the riots erupted on Monday and the airport shut. ""People believe the cholera came from Nepal."" In Quartier Morin, a municipality in the Cap Haitien arrondissement, a protester was killed after he was hit by a peacekeeper who fired in self defense, the U.N. said. An investigation is underway. The cholera outbreak, which was confirmed last month in northwest Haiti, has killed 1,034 of the 16,799 people who had been hospitalized with the disease, the Ministry of Public Health reported. It has been confirmed in seven of the country's 10 departments. So far, the government has been keeping track of the outcome only for those patients who have sought treatment in hospitals. ""We are now trying to ramp up the collection of data from the communities so that we can get a more realistic figure,"" Deputy Special Representative and Humanitarian Coordinator Nigel Fisher told reporters Monday at the United Nations in a teleconference call from Port-au-Prince. ""We expect to have, once that data comes in, a significant increase in recorded cases."" But counting the deaths that occur in the community will be difficult, said Pan American Health Organization spokesman Dan Epstein. He noted that care is being provided by ""tons of NGOs,"" each with their own hospitals and health centers. ""We're trying to integrate everything so we have one main source of information for Haiti, and that's a real challenge."" The government was trying to halt the spread of rumors and to educate the populace via radio and television programs about how to stem the spread of the disease, which experts say is relatively easy to treat through oral-rehydration therapy, and to prevent, through good hygiene. Both are often in short supply in much of Haiti, the hemisphere's poorest country. Its already fragile infrastructure was worsened during last January's earthquake, which killed more than 200,000 people. Since then, more than 1 million people have been living in makeshift camps in and around the capital. Still, many of the camps are equipped with latrines and most people in the camps are getting clean, chlorinated water, Fisher said. ""Our concern has been, I must say, less for the camps than it has been for the slums,"" he added, citing the Cite Soleil slum in the capital as an example. It has neither latrines nor access to clean water, ripe conditions for the spread of the disease. ""It is moving more rapidly in the slums than in the camps,"" he said. Despite the dire conditions and the mounting death count, he said, ""the government strategy, which we support at the moment, is to look at ways in which the (November 28) elections can go ahead -- even with the situation of cholera."" Planning has begun on how to disinfect polling booths between voters, he said. The situation has gone far beyond one of health or sanitation, he said. ""It's an issue, obviously, of national security."" Efforts are under way to get 10,000 to 12,000 more ""cholera beds"" in place, and plans are being put in place to transport the sickest people to treatment centers, which some residents don't want, he said. ""One of the demonstrations in Port-au-Prince was against the transport of sick people from a triage center to a cholera treatment center,"" he said. The government has asked Haiti's mayors to handle the disposition of bodies, but city authorities need help on how to do that, he said. The team leader in Haiti for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's anti-cholera effort said the agency determined that the strain of the bacteria is found not only in South Asia but elsewhere. ""This is not an uncommon strain,"" Dr. Jordan Tappero told CNN in a telephone interview from Port-au-Prince. ""It's around the world."" He described the bacteria, orginally found in the Artibonite River in the country's northern region, as ""like a hitchhiker,"" having arrived in Haiti through contaminated food, water, or in an infected individual who may have had no symptoms. ""Trying to figure out who did it and what country they came from, I think, is extremely challenging to do, probably not possible,"" Tappero said. ""What we should focus on, as we have been, is preventing deaths."" Those prevention efforts include training health care workers, few of whom have experience treating patients who may be losing up to a liter of water per hour. ""It requires some training"" to manage them well, he said. The goal, he added, is to get mortality to less than 1 percent, ""and we're not there yet."" Indeed, as of Tuesday, the death rate among hospitalized patients with cholera was 3.9 percent nationwide, according to the Ministry of Public Health. The United Nations, which has appealed to international donors for $164 million in aid, said it anticipates as many as 200,000 Haitians will be sickened with cholera over the next six to 12 months. Symptoms of the acute, bacterial illness, which is caused by drinking tainted water, can be mild or even nonexistent. But sometimes they can be severe: leg cramps, profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting, which can cause rapid loss of body fluids and lead to dehydration, shock and death.

"(CNN)This time last year, Li Na was at the center of the tennis universe as she won her second grand slam title at the Australian Open. Twelve months on, the former world No. 2 is facing a whole new challenge -- getting to grips with the vacuum cleaner. Persistent and worsening knee problems forced her to retire in September at the age of 32, and she admits the transition from tennis star to domestic goddess has been challenging. ""I do the house cleaning. Before, when I was traveling, I thought it was all pretty easy. And now I have to do all these things I think tennis is much easier,"" she told CNN's Open Court. Luckily for Li, she can count on the support of her husband Dennis, with whom she is expecting her first child this summer. ""Family for me is most important thing,"" she said, two days before announcing her pregnancy on the opening day of the year's first grand slam. ""I'm starting to learn how to cook -- before, I never had the time or the chance. Now sometimes I say: 'Hey Dennis -- I always do the house cleaning, you have to do some cooking.' He's a little bit like: 'Hey, I'm the man -- why should I do this?' Li, China's most successful tennis export, became Asia's first grand slam singles champion at the 2011 French Open before adding another title with that victory in Melbourne last year. But she says she'll be happy for all that to be forgotten if she can help usher through a new generation of Chinese tennis stars. ""I will try to have a tennis academy to help more young children,"" she explains. ""When I said I would retire and said I wanted a tennis academy, everyone in China invited me. ""But I have to find the right one, of course, in a big city, and to have communication with the government."" From what she has seen so far, lack of belief shouldn't be a problem when it comes to the nation's promising youngsters. ""I hear people say: 'Oh, my daughter is 10 times better than Li Na,' she smiles. ""I like this confidence. At least they have a goal."" And if she succeeds in her aim of encouraging fresh talent, Li -- who won a total of nine WTA titles -- says she wants people's memories of her outstanding career to fade quietly away. ""Honestly, I would like the world to forget me,"" she adds. ""Because, if they always remember me, that will mean that Chinese tennis hasn't grown up. I wish that a lot of young or new players will come up and people will say: 'Oh, this is a Chinese player.'"" But she admits leaving her own career behind was a very hard step to take, describing the decision to quit as ""pretty sad."" It was also inevitable. ""My knee couldn't handle it any more,"" she adds. ""I think it was after Wimbledon that I saw the knee was getting even worse. ""At the end of July, I had to have my fourth operation. I tried to recover, but didn't do very well. ""Women's tennis now is pretty tough, and everyone is much stronger. So if I couldn't stay healthy, I couldn't play at the highest level. If you're a professional athlete, you always want to win all of them [matches]. You never want to lose on court."" After all those years on the tour -- she turned professional in 1999 -- Li is slowly getting used to the idea of spending more time at leisure and less jetting from country to country. But she will never take her eyes off what is happening in the tennis world, and is watching the continuing progress of Japanese star Kei Nishikori with increasing interest. ""I think he's doing amazingly,"" she adds. ""Last year, in the U.S. Open, he was pretty close to the trophy."" She hopes the Japanese star's success will also inspire the men's game in China. ""He's doing well, but he's not so tall or so strong. People can think: 'He's not a western player,' and maybe men players [in China] can think we could do the same or even better."" And as she settles down to watch her first Australian Open for years as a spectator rather than a participant, who does Li feel might take the title that her retirement has left her unable to defend? ""I think maybe [Wimbledon champion] Petra Kvitova,"" she says, backing her best friend on the tour. ""I like the way she hits."" But -- as if we really needed warning -- don't write off Serena Williams. ""If she wants to win, she can win."" Whoever lifts the trophy, it might inspire Li -- knees permitting, of course -- to get back out on court and start hitting a few shots. There will be no glory this time, though, and no fans: all future games will be strictly for fun. After all, as she says, you can't totally leave something that has been so central to your world behind. ""Tennis is my life,"" she concludes. ""I grew up with tennis, and everything I know is from tennis.""","Two-time Grand Slam winner Li Na announced her retirement in 2014 .

"(CNN)What President Barack Obama described as the greatest threat to future generations was neither terrorism nor ISIS. It wasn't nuclear weapons in rogue states either. ""No challenge  poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change,"" said Obama in his State of the Union speech Tuesday. His statement was met with scattered, muted applause. The United States should lead in international efforts to protect ""the one planet we've got,"" he said. 2014 was the warmest year since record keeping began. ""One year doesn't make a trend,"" he said. ""But this does  --  14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century."" But American commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming has been intermittent throughout the years. The United States did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, a binding agreement in 1997 to cut greenhouse gas emissions. A 2007 U.N. climate change conference ended with anger at the United States, then under the Bush administration, when it balked at binding carbon cuts. ""We were used to having U.S. as a pariah,"" said Liz Gallagher, the  program leader of climate diplomacy at E3G, an environmental group. Environmentalist noted a shift in recent years under Obama, including a recent agreement with China to reduce emissions. ""It's better to have America inside the game than outside. It makes it easier to persuade everyone else,"" said Gallagher. Critical year for climate change policy . The U.S. remains the second greatest polluter, behind China. In a historic climate change deal in November, Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that both countries would curb their greenhouse gas emissions over the next two decades. The two countries account for over one third of global greenhouse gas emissions. ""Because the world's two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up, and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we've got,"" Obama said during his speech. A critical UN Climate Change Conference will be held in Paris in December this year, aimed at reaching a legally-binding, international climate agreement. ""This is a pivotal year for advancing the climate effort both at home and internationally, and the president's continued leadership is essential on both fronts,"" said Bob Perciasepe, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. Climate change disproportionately affects the most impoverished. Rising sea levels, threatened water and food supply devastate people's lives. A U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in a report that the effects of climate change could cost governments around the world more than $100 billion a year. Warming and warning . Since 1880, the Earth's average surface temperature has warmed by about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius), according to NASA scientists. Most of the warming has occurred in the past three decades. ""The best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we do not act forcefully, we'll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe,"" Obama said. ""The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act like it.""","Obama met with scattered applause when he calls climate change greatest threat to future generations .

"(CNN)Happiness isn't the only contagious thing at Disneyland in California. There's an outbreak of measles linked to the theme park, and one of California's top public health officials recommended that children under 12 months and people who've never had a measles vaccination stay away from the park while the disease event continues. Dr. Gil Chavez, deputy director of the state's Center for Infectious Diseases, noted at a Wednesday news conference that Disneyland would be ""perfectly safe"" if you've been immunized. When asked for a response, Suzi Brown of Disney media relations said, ""We agree with Dr. Chavez's comments that it is safe to visit Disneyland if you have been vaccinated."" Forty-two of the state's 59 measles cases since December can be linked to initial exposure at Disneyland and the adjacent Disney California Adventure Park in Anaheim, California Department of Public Health officials said. In addition, nine other cases from people living outside of California were linked to Disneyland, authorities said. The people in those cases live in Utah, Washington state, Oregon, Arizona and the country of Mexico, authorities said. The most recently reported case outside of California was in Arizona. A woman in her 50s who visited Disneyland in mid-December came down with measles but has since recovered, the Maricopa County Department of Public Health said in a statement Thursday. Since Friday, California's public health department had been saying the disease linked to Disney was over. But on Wednesday, Kathleen Harriman, chief of the Vaccine Preventable Epidemiology Section for the state public health department, said the most recent case was diagnosed, in a park employee, on Sunday. This outbreak, health officials said Wednesday, is ongoing. Measles is a respiratory disease caused by a virus and spread through the air, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Measles starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and sore throat, the CDC said. The disease outbreak apparently surfaced when visitors reported coming down with measles after visiting the park December 15-20. For the most part, it spreads among those who have not been vaccinated against the virus. Overall, 82% of those infected in this outbreak were not vaccinated, either because they're too young or because they elected not to be, officials said. Opinion: Heed the lesson from Disneyland measles outbreak . On Tuesday, Disney said five Disney employees had been diagnosed with measles, three of whom have fully recovered. After Orange County health officials notified Disneyland of the measles cases on January 7, ""we immediately began to communicate to our cast to raise awareness,"" the theme park's chief medical officer, Dr. Pamela Hymel, said in a statement.  Disneyland refers to its employees as cast members. ""In an abundance of caution, we also offered vaccinations and immunity tests,"" Disney said. ""To date, a few Cast Members have tested positive and some have been medically cleared and returned to work.  Cast Members who may have come in contact with those who were positive are being tested for the virus.  While awaiting results, they have been put on paid leave until medically cleared."" It's not clear how many of the theme park employees were vaccinated. So far, five children and 13 adults have been diagnosed with measles in Orange County, according to the county health agency. One school in Huntington Beach has barred children who could not prove that they were vaccinated for measles from going to school until January 29, according to the county health agency. Chavez said this is standard protocol for any school or childcare facility where a student has the virus. Those showing measles symptoms shouldn't be bashful about seeing their doctor, because a full body rash is likely to break out next. ""If you have symptoms, and believe you may have been exposed, please contact your health care provider,"" said Dr. Ron Chapman, director of the state health department. Vaccination is key. ""Two doses of measles-containing vaccine (MMR vaccine) are more than 99 percent effective in preventing measles,"" the health department said in a press release. ""Measles vaccines have been available in the United States since 1963, and two doses have been recommended since 1989."" Measles was considered eliminated in the United States in 2000, though 2014 saw a record-breaking number of confirmed cases: 644 from 27 states, according to the CDC. Last year there was a large outbreak of 380 cases in an Ohio religious community that doesn't usually vaccinate, said Dr. Mark Papania, medical epidemiologist with the CDC's Division of Viral Diseases. That outbreak drove up the numbers for 2014, he said. More than half of the 23 outbreaks in 2014 had five or less cases, he said. Other than Ohio, only two outbreaks had more than 20 cases. Health officials are concerned that an outbreak of more than 40 cases is occurring in the first week of January, Papania said. ""The numbers of cases seems to be increasing,"" Papania said. "" Last year was record high and we are already high (this year)."" 5 things to know about measles .

"Yaounde, Cameroon (CNN)Cameroonian troops and their allies have freed a German man who was held for six months by Islamist terror group Boko Haram, Cameroonian President Paul Biya said. Boko Haram kidnapped German citizen Robert Nitsch Eberhard in Nigeria in July, Biya said in a statement read Wednesday on state-run broadcaster CRTV. He did not detail how, when or where the rescue operation took place. ""A special operation of Cameroonian armed forces and security services of friendly countries"" freed the man, he said. Eberhard told journalists he was glad to be alive. ""I am happy to see all these people around me, who have rescued me and made sure that I survived, because until the last minute, I did not know whether I would survive or I would not survive. It was for me a big problem. Because it was darkness, total darkness, and you see nobody around you. Then this is a big problem to say OK, I will survive or not survive,"" Eberhard said. Eberhard was flown in from Cameroon's Far North Region to Yaounde shortly after noon Wednesday. He said he was grateful to all those who worked to secure his release. The German ambassador to Cameroon, Klaus-Ludwig Keferstein, also thanked Cameroonian authorities, particularly because ""we could find a solution to this problem of hostage-taking,"" he said. Eberhard spoke amid heavy security and mentioned that he was teaching at a vocational school in Gombe, Adamawa state, Nigeria, before the insurgents took him hostage in July. He has been taken to the residence of the German ambassador in Yaounde. The ambassador said initial medical care will be given to him before he is flown back to Germany for more medical attention. Biya said he was thankful to all those who ""directly or indirectly helped in the achievement ... and particularly the German government for their precious contribution."" He did not specify how Germany participated. The German Foreign Office did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, chairwoman of the African Union Commission, praised ""the decision of President Idriss Deby Itno of Chad, at the request of Cameroon, to deploy troops in that country, to contribute to the ongoing operations against the Boko Haram terrorist group."" Boko Haram, which has fought an anti-government campaign in northeastern Nigeria and parts of Cameroon, said previously that it was holding a German hostage. Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau said so in November, in a video message denying Nigeria's claims that it had struck a ceasefire deal with the group. It wasn't immediately clear if this was Eberhard. The operation came days after about 2,000 Chadian troops arrived in Cameroon to help fight the insurgents. Boko Haram, which means ""Western education is forbidden"" in the local Hausa dialect, has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. It has kidnapped students, including more than 200 schoolgirls who were abducted in northeastern Nigeria in April and remain missing. The Islamist group has attacked neighboring Cameroon, initially by crossing the border from Nigeria to steal food or kidnap foreign nationals. More recently, the group went after Cameroonian military installations. On Sunday, suspected Boko Haram militants kidnapped 80 people in Cameroon's Far North Region, officials in the country said. By Monday, a military operation had freed 24 of the captives; three others were found dead, state-run media reported. Boko Haram has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Biya has called for international cooperation in the fight against Boko Haram. Last week, the Russian ambassador to Cameroon, Nicolay Ratsiborinski, said his country will supply Cameroon with modern and sophisticated military weapons, including heavy artillery, armored cars and missiles. Michael Stephen Hoza, U.S. ambassador to Cameroon, said the United States would help train Cameroon soldiers and offer equipment for the fight.

"Paris (CNN)French Prime Minister Manuel Valls on Wednesday announced ""exceptional measures"" to respond to the ""change of scale"" of the terrorist threat in the wake of deadly attacks two weeks ago in Paris. Valls said close to 3,000 people in France with jihadist ties needed to be under surveillance -- and that the number of people with links to networks in Iraq and Syria had increased by 130% in the past year. In response to the threat, 2,680 new jobs will be created, of which intelligence services alone will account for 1,100, he said. Many of the new jobs will be dedicated to tackling the threat from online jihadism. France will allocate 425 million euros ($490 million) over the next three years to boost the fight against extremism, Valls said. These resources will be used to buy new equipment, such as bulletproof vests and better weapons for police officers. Valls also said a new bill would be presented in April aimed at reinforcing the intelligence services' legal position in conducting surveillance. Efforts for early detection of radicalization will be enhanced within the Justice Ministry, he said. People charged with or convicted of acts of terrorism will be placed on a list and required to report trips abroad or changes of address. Other measures are aimed at preventing radicalization in prisons and online. Internet companies and social networks will be expected to cooperate closely with authorities, Valls said. The Prime Minister also detailed the ""consequences for those who attack the nation,"" which may include removal from French territory for radical Islamists, or loss of French citizenship. The latter measure will need to be validated by the Constitutional Council on Friday. The costs of the new anti-terrorism provisions will be met through savings in other areas of public spending, Valls said. Through these measures, he concluded, the government was sending a ""message of relentless determination"" to the French people. Valls' announcement comes as Europe ramps up efforts against Islamist extremism in the wake of the Paris attacks. The attacks this month against the satirical Charlie Hebdo magazine and a kosher supermarket have turned the spotlight on links between radical Islamists in Europe and terror networks elsewhere. Al Qaeda's Yemen affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), has claimed to be behind the January 7 massacre by gunmen Said and Cherif Kouachi at the offices of Charlie Hebdo. And gunman Amedy Coulibaly, who attacked the kosher grocery store on January 9, proclaimed his allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. The suspects in the Paris attacks may have urged their associates to leave France before the plot was carried out, law enforcement sources told CNN. European authorities  are concerned that about half a dozen people with ties to the terror suspects are believed to be in Syria and could return to Europe to launch more attacks, the sources said. A Western official added the recent arrests across Europe are similar to the ""hyper-reactivity"" after 9/11 in the United States. ""We've become hyper-reactive to any suggestion of Islamic extremism and are chasing a lot of ghosts out of an excess of caution,"" the official said. ""Some are legitimate, and some are not."" From Antwerp to Aleppo and back: Europe's nightmare . In a video released this week, a senior AQAP leader and spokesman urged all would-be jihadists to wage war at home, when possible, as opposed to traveling abroad. ""If he is capable to wage individual jihad in the Western countries that fight Islam -- such as America, Britain, France, Canada, and others of the countries that represent the head of disbelief in waging war against Islam ... If he is capable of that, then that is better and more harmful,"" said Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi. He continued: ""But if that is impossible, and he is able to serve his brothers on the front lines, then let him immigrate, for it is better."" An off-camera interviewer asked why attacks have abated in the United States. ""By the grace of Allah the great (and) the almighty, we have made efforts in external work, and the enemy knows the danger of that,"" al-Ansi said. ""We are preparing and lurking for the enemies of Allah. We incite the believers to do that."" Paris prosecutor François Molins told a news conference that progress has been made in the investigation into the attack carried out by Coulibaly, but less so in the probe into the Kouachi brothers. Molins identified four suspects still in custody as Willy P., Christophe R., Tonino G. and Michael A., giving only the first initial of their last names, and outlined details of the charges against them. None of the four men has been charged with complicity in the kosher market attack. The first three, Willy P., Christophe R. and Tonino G., were present when Coulibaly bought the Renault car that he used to reach the site of the attack. It was found parked near the Porte de Vincennes after the attack. The fingerprints of the fourth suspect, named as Michael A., were found on one of the weapons that police discovered in Coulibaly's secret apartment in Gentilly, authorities say. His DNA was also found on a glove discovered at the scene of the crime, the prosecutor says. In the days leading up to the attack, Michael A. had exchanged 362 text messages and 18 phone calls with Coulibaly, the prosecutor says. The two men met on January 5, four days before Coulibaly's attack. The four men in custody, all in their 20s, were among nine people arrested in a police operation Friday. Five other suspects held since Friday were released Monday night. Amid heightened concern over the threat posed by radical Islamists in Europe, Belgium and Germany have cracked down on alleged extremists in recent days. Belgian authorities continue the hunt for the ringleader behind a terrorist cell targeted in countrywide raids last week in which two suspects died. The suspected key link between senior ISIS operatives in Syria and the Belgian terrorist cell -- Belgian-Moroccan ISIS fighter Abdelhamid Abaaoud -- is still at large, a senior Belgian counterterrorism official said Monday. His last known location was Greece, the official said. One line of inquiry being looked at is whether Abaaoud tried to fake his own death last year while fighting with ISIS in Syria so that he could disappear off the radar screen of Western intelligence services. In October, his family in Brussels received word he had been ""martyred,"" his sister told a Belgian newspaper. Belgian investigators believe Abaaoud, rather than dying on the front lines, traveled to Greece and suspect he was communicating by phone from there with the terrorist cell in Belgium. Despite an international manhunt, involving both American and European intelligence agencies, Abaaoud remains at large. The concern is he will return to Syria before he can found. The Belgian prosecutor's office, meanwhile, said Wednesday that custody had been extended for three suspects arrested in last Thursday's raids. All three are charged with participation at the activities of a terrorist group and violation of weapons laws. One is also charged with armed rebellion, in a group, with premeditation. That last is Marouan El Bali, who survived the police raid in Verviers in which two suspects died. His attorney said he was not involved in terrorism, but was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. The Greek authorities have also agreed to the extradition of an Algerian suspect named as Omar S., the Belgian prosecutor's office said. The extradition could take place in the following days. When he arrives in Belgium, he will be brought before the investigating judge, who will decide on an arrest warrant, the prosecutor's office said. Another suspect, named as Abdelmounaim H, was arrested Tuesday and charged with participation in the activities of a terrorist group. He's due to appear before a Brussels court on Friday, the prosecutor's office said. Federal prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt said last week that the alleged terror cell targeted in the countrywide raids was on the brink of an attack and planned to target police officers. Meanwhile, police in Berlin, Brandenburg and Thuringen raided 13 properties linked to suspected radical Islamists overnight Monday to Tuesday. The raids are part of the investigation into two alleged Islamists who were arrested Friday, identified as Ismet D. and Emin F., Berlin police said. Both of them are accused of providing logistical aid to ISIS. Those subject to the raids have not yet been accused of any crimes, but had contact with Ismet D. and Emin F. There are no indications that the group was preparing attacks in Germany. Coulibaly killed four hostages at the kosher grocery store in Paris before police killed him. He's also believed to have killed a policewoman a day earlier. New surveillance video obtained by CNN purportedly shows Coulibaly and Hayat Boumedienne -- believed currently to be in Syria -- outside a Jewish institution in Paris. A source familiar with the ongoing investigation into the Paris attacks says there is a high degree of confidence that the video shows Coulibaly and Boumedienne. The video was recorded at the end of August or beginning of September and stored on a security camera. The source says the nature of the video makes it clear that the couple were carrying out surveillance of possible targets for months before Coulibaly launched his attack against the kosher supermarket. The video was stored because it showed possible signs of unusual activity at the location, says the source. CNN's Sandrine Amiel reported from Paris, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London. CNN's Pamela Brown, Paul Cruickshank, Tim Lister, Marilia Brocchetto, Anna-Maja Rappard, Mohammed Tawfeeq and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","AQAP leader urges all would-be jihadists to wage war at home .

"Bath, Maine (CNN)Joe Leask spends most of his workday much like he starts it: swallowed in darkness. First by the morning, and later by the sea. Awake at 3:30 a.m., Leask heads first to the Bath, Maine, outpost of Frosty's Donuts for a Boston creme, small-town pleasantries and precisely the amount of coffee you would expect for a witching hour wake-up call. Then, it's an hour drive to the coastal community of Rockland and his floating ""office,"" the November Gale. ""You're going to want to sit down,"" Leask says when a wave swallows the vessel's bow as it makes its way well into Maine's Penobscot Bay. The November Gale tows a rickety 20-foot fishing boat close behind. The sun starts to tease its light over the horizon, but on a merciless December morning, its warm rays are an empty promise. As a sea urchin diver, this is Leask's version of a nine-to-five for the 38-day winter diving season. Equipped with a refashioned gardening tool and a mesh catch bag, he descends into the icy depths to rake for the area's prized green urchin. ""My job is sometimes the easiest job in the world and sometimes my job is the most difficult job in the world,"" Leask says. The day's end goal is the urchin's inner roe, commonly referred to as uni. More technically speaking, the yellow-orange delicacy is the animal's gonads, but the marketing choice is clear. Uni is buttery and briny, with a custard-like texture. It's often described as ""an acquired taste,"" flavored distinctively of the sea, which is perhaps one of its most desirable traits; there's nothing else quite like it. Above water, Leask's right-hand man, Clint Richardson, navigates the smaller boat with precision as a cigarette dangles from his mouth. His job is to look for bubbles or flippers as a sign of Leask; once spotted, he tosses a second bag in Leask's general direction and hoists up the first. Soon, he's methodically measuring each urchin from the first net and throwing back any animals that are less than 2 1/16-inch wide for a good yield of roe (measured by a ratio of gonad to whole urchin weight). The domestic urchin industry has seen a steady uptick in the past few years as the American palate wants new, now, next. Recently, it has become a darling of the growing gastronomy scene, often cited with the same reverence as hot ticket (and high-priced) items like foie gras, truffles and monkfish liver. But the industry has reached a crossroads as conservation efforts have kept the delicacy virtually off limits to new divers. ""Most Americans get bored with food real easily, so this is a new and hot item that is unique in taste and texture,"" Leask says. The industry, however, wasn't initially fueled by stateside demand, but rather by the Japanese. ""When I was a kid we had a cereal made of uni,"" Leask jokes. ""No, I never saw an urchin until I was two years out of high school."" Japanese-born Atchan Tamaki, who is now based in Portland, Maine, was one of the first to crack the potential of the eerie-looking echinoderms. He moved to Portland shortly after graduating from the University of Montana -- ""no urchin there,"" he jokes -- to help a friend open the town's first Japanese restaurant. By 1989, he had established ISF Trading Inc., and started shipping Maine's best known seafood, the lobster, to his home country. ""The lobster fishermen kept asking me if there was a market for sea urchin because they were getting a lot of them in the traps,"" Tamaki said. Growing up, he knew the sweet roe was a hot commodity in his community. He also knew that around Christmas, when urchins were not in season for Japan, they were in Maine. When Leask started diving in 1992, 100% of the fished urchins were exported to Japan. Now, only 20% are shipped abroad while the other 80% are shipped domestically, Tamaki says. ""We started out diving for 25 cents an urchin. When I got 35 cents a pound, I thought I was going to get rich. Then, it hit a dollar a pound and we all celebrated -- and then it hit $2 a pound,"" Leask says, adding that in recent years, the price has gone as high as $7.60 a pound. But with added demand comes the glut of potential harvesters. By 1994, there were 1,700 urchin diving licenses (plus 1,000 dragger licenses) issued in the state, according to Maggie Hunter, a biologist at the Maine Department of Marine Resources. Hunter, along with Leask and Tamaki, serves on the Maine Sea Urchin Zone Council, which was created to address concerns of depletion at the height of the urchin explosion in the early 1990s. The council ultimately divided the region into two zones, with a 15-day season for Zone 1 divers and a 38-day season for Zone 2. In Zone 2, Leask is permitted to fill up only seven bins weighing 600 pounds total per day, and dive Monday through Wednesday. The council also imposed a moratorium on licenses. As of 2013, there were 37 active divers in Zone 1 and 77 active divers in Zone 2; with the average ages at 49 and 46 years old, respectively. ""And that's pretty old for a diver,"" Hunter says. Those divers, like Leask, are at a delicate crossroads where they're going to need new people to start learning the ropes without compromising their conservation efforts. Hunter says the department does a survey dive every spring to inform their evaluation on licensing. As Leask's head surfaces above the water back in the bay, he doesn't betray any inner turmoil about his profession's sink or swim moment. He's at peace. ""There's nowhere else that I can think of that you're going to escape cell phones and noise,"" Leask says.","The domestic popularity of sea urchins has grown considerably in recent years .
Maine is grappling with the demand and conservation efforts .
Urchins are wanted at restaurants for their prized roe, called uni ."

"(CNN)Newtown, Connecticut, council members voted unanimously Wednesday to tear down the home of Adam Lanza, the site where he killed his mother before massacring 26 others at a nearby elementary school in 2012, according to First Selectman Patricia Llodra. The spacious yellow colonial, which sits on a hill on a grassy 2-acre property, was the first of two crime scenes in December 2012. Lanza, 20, shot his mother through her forehead in her second-floor bedroom. Lanza then went to nearby Sandy Hook Elementary School and killed 20 children and six educators before killing himself. There is no timetable to raze the home, but Mary Ann Jacob, chairman for the Newtown Legislative Council, said a town meeting will be held, which is a formality, and then ""the demolition can take place as soon as is practical."" Report finds missed chances to help Newtown shooter . Llodra, whose position is equivalent to town mayor, has suggested the town's legal counsel craft language that ensures any proceeds gained from the land or property be used to benefit the families of victims. When the home was last appraised in 2012, it was estimated to be worth $523,620. After the incident, authorities boarded up the front door to the home, where investigators found more than 1,600 rounds of ammunition, at least 10 knives and three samurai swords, among other weapons. A look at Newtown in 2013 . Sandy Hook Elementary School was demolished in 2013 and is being rebuilt, according to the town's website. Neighbors and townspeople have hoped that the house, a reminder of the second-deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, be torn down. ""I think it was the right thing to do for the families who live there and have to deal with the curiosity seekers,"" Jacob said. ""I think they should have their neighborhood back.""

"(CNN)The recent terrorist attacks in France and the rise of  violent attacks by terrorist cells elsewhere using religion as their calling card have cast an additional hew of darkness upon an already darkening world. Democracy, freedom of religion and speech are gifts that help define what it means to be fully human. But within any democracy there must exist a level of respectful restraint when challenging or debating treasured religious values of the ""other."" The Islamic admonition of not depicting the Prophet Mohammed in any human image is a sacred element of Islam. For anyone, Muslim or non-Muslim to do so is to disrespect and demean a basic tenant of the faith. What has happened tragically in France has provided other terrorists -- using religion as their selfish and feckless calling card -- with a motive to kill in the name of God. The end result of this latest slaughter is the construction of a global arena pitting freedom of speech against a time honored understanding of how to acknowledge the presence of the Prophet Mohammed in the world. Those who bully, abuse, imprison, and kill using religion as the rationale for their actions are neither religious nor faithful to their Abrahamic roots. Theirs is a desire to pit Muslims, Christians and Jews against one another in a religious war that will terminate years of hard won respectful, interreligious dialogue between the three great Abrahamic faiths; dialogue that has a place in creating a  more peaceable and forgiving world. Theirs is a desire to demean the genius of democracy, freedom of speech and religion to create a false image of Islam as a violent, vengeful religion. Nothing could be further from the truth! It is important to honor the lives lost in France and to remember that those murdered were Jews, Christians and a Muslim. Terrorists kill not only for their own sick, selfish motives but to create an environment where violence and hate will overwhelm peace and reconciliation between the faiths. They endeavor to show that democracy and freedom of speech have no place in their warped understanding of the Islamic world. ""Je suis Charlie"" is a phrase shared by millions, yet we all must understand that with freedom of speech must also come  a sense of respectful restraint in criticizing or demeaning the personhood or values of another, especially their religion during these tension filled times where sectarian violence is trying to rule the day. My Anglican colleague and Nobel Laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa reminded me that the essence of being human is contained in the African word ""ubuntu,""meaning a person can only be a person through engagement with another -- ""I am because you are!"" We can only be fully human when we are bound by trust, mutual respect and valuing the human dignity of another person. It is only by experiencing and embracing the ""other"" that we can be touched by the very hand of God, made whole and made a new creation. It is only then that we can extend our reach beyond our grasp and begin to change the future of humanity in a culture of peace. At this moment in time Christianity, Islam and Judaism have a great opportunity to work together effectively with governments and civil societies currently in turmoil. The Abrahamic faiths have the opportunity to re-shape the world into a culture of peace rather than a world torn asunder by violence, extremism and political pilfering. Christianity, Islam and Judaism must become the bridge builders of this century to span the raging waters of human conflict . It is pure heresy that has given birth to human behavior sustained by fear and hate rather than by love of God, love of self and love of neighbor. It is this heresy that takes the unconditional love of God for all human beings, hijacks it and shreds it into pieces of human interpretation that bear no resemblance to the core teachings of the One God of Christianity, Islam and Judaism as we know them. No person has the right to take the life of another person in the name of God. Human beings who claim to represent the true teachings of Christianity, Islam and Judaism and who indiscriminately slaughter those who are the ""other"" have lost the most fundamental principle of their religious tradition's theology. They have lost the core of a compassionate and loving God. Christians find direction in the New Testament from 1st John 4:18; ""there is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment. And whoever fears has not reached perfection in love.  Those who say; I love God and hate their brothers and sisters who they have seen cannot love God who they have not seen. The Commandment that we have from Him is this; those who love God must love their brothers and sisters."" Rabbi Jonathan Sacks wrote; ""I believe that we are being summoned by God to see in the human 'other' a face of the divine 'other.' The test so lamentably failed by the great powers of the 20th century is to see the Divine presence in the face of the stranger. To heed the cry of those who are disempowered in the age of unprecedented powers; who are hungry and poor and ignorant and uneducated, whose human potential is being denied the chance to be expressed. That is the faith of Abraham and Sarah who, with the great faiths Judaism, Christianity and Islam, trace their spiritual or actual ancestry."" War, sectarian violence and terrorism are definitions of human failure. For all who follow the teachings of the Prophets, Jesus and Mohammed, who will now stand firm and commit themselves to end all acts of violence and extremism done in the name of God? If not us, then who?","The attacks in France have pitted freedom of speech against respect for religious values, writes Bishop John Bryson Chane .
Bishop Chane says those who bully, abuse and kill in the name of the Abrahamic religions are neither religious nor faithful .
He says Christians, Muslims and Jews should work together to end conflict and extremism by those hijacking God's name ."
"(CNN)Anne Kirkbride, who played Deirdre Barlow for more than 40 years on the long-running UK soap opera ""Coronation Street,"" has died. She was 60. The death was confirmed in a post on the website for ITV, the UK network that airs the show. ""There are no words to describe the sense of grief we feel at Anne's passing,"" executive producer Kieran Roberts said in the post. ""We know only too acutely how much Anne meant to the millions of people who watched her create the legendary character of Deirdre Barlow."" Kirkbride first showed up on ""Coronation Street,"" the world's longest-running soap opera, in 1972 as a teenager with a handful of lines. Within a few years, she had entered into a short-lived marriage with one character and then a romance and marriage with another, Ken Barlow (William Roache, who'd been on the show since its inception in 1960). The latter proved to be as big in Britain as the Luke-and-Laura storyline on ""General Hospital"" in the United States. According to the Guardian, at one point, the scoreboard at a Manchester United game informed a stadium full of fans that ""Deirdre and Ken united again!"" The raspy-voiced character -- Kirkbride had a long smoking habit -- was Kirkbride's main claim to fame, though she started in the theater and was first noticed in another program, a 1972 filmed play called ""Another Sunday and Sweet F.A."" Intensely private, she once told the Guardian's Anthony Hayward that she was perfectly happy with staying true to ""Coronation Street."" ""I just enjoy having something to do that's good, something that's interesting and gives me a lot of scope,"" she said. ""I wouldn't be here if I wanted to perform Shakespeare."" Kirkbride was a survivor of non-Hodgkin lymphoma -- she lost her hair and acted in a wig for a time -- and talked about her depression in a 2012 documentary, ""Deirdre & Me: 40 Years on Coronation Street.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)Gov. Chris Christie said President Barack Obama's State of the Union address was ""a bit disconnected from reality,"" arguing that it felt like a ""campaign speech"" and that the President failed to strike a tone of unity. ""I thought the most ironic part of what the President said last night was when he said he ran his last campaign,"" the New Jersey Republican told reporters in Washington on Wednesday morning. ""It sounded to me like a campaign speech last night, like the '04 speech, like the '08 speech."" When Obama said he had run his final campaign Tuesday night, some members of the audience applauded. Obama quickly shot back: ""I know, because I won both of them."" Christie's comments came after he spent two hours in a Capitol Hill row house, meeting with a few dozen House GOP lawmakers, as well as Republican Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois. ""(Obama) had an opportunity to try to unite the country last night and he didn't take it,"" Christie said. Billed an informal meet-and-greet, the event was arranged by Rep. Candice Miller of Detroit, who said she likes Christie's ""blunt"" style and wanted to provide an opportunity for him to spell out his vision for the future of the party and to meet other lawmakers. ""I like straight talkers,"" she said, ""In my county ... we like blunt. It sells well there. We want the unvarnished truth. We know what the challenges are. We want someone who can tell us how to solve those challenges."" Christie, who was also in the area to attend incoming Gov. Larry Hogan's inauguration ceremony in Maryland, said he focused his message on governing. ""They have an obligation to govern and they need to govern in a way they think is in the best interest of the country,"" he said, adding that he knew most of the people in attendance. After the House members left, Christie spent close to half an hour with Kirk. The senator told reporters that he's been talking to the governor about foreign affairs and they specifically discussed his amendment that would impose sanctions on Iran if the country doesn't agree to a new deal to limit its nuclear weapons program. Kirk is sponsoring the legislation with Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey. As Christie prepares for a potential presidential bid, he's been trying to boost his foreign policy credentials. The governor's traveling to the United Kingdom next month, making his third foreign trip since September. Miller said Christie talked about national security and the threat of ISIS during the event, but did not offer specifics. Rep. Tom Reed, R-New York, said Christie ""had a good message about the future"" and felt ""impressed by his delivery."" ""As he's preparing for his decision, he's definitely evolving into a very creditable, national candidate,"" he said. ""One of the things I learned today is that he's clearly committed to the collaborative approach, trying to build networks of influencers, and that's very helpful in this town,"" Reed continued. ""The way you get things done here is you build relationships, and that was part of the effort here."" Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania said the main message he took away from Christie was that ""whatever it is you're going to do, you're going to have to win."" ""I've often felt that the country was ready for a big guy with an attitude from Jersey,"" Dent added. Other members who attended included Rep. Patrick Meehan, who co-hosted with Miller, Rep. Leonard Lance of New Jersey, Rep. Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, Rep. Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania, Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, Rep. Aaron Schock of Illinois, former Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, and Rep. Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey.","Chris Christie said President Obama failed to strike a tone of unity in his State of the Union address .

"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN)On a bright, clear morning in April 2013, two professional poker players from California were heading west on Interstate 80 in rural Iowa when they were stopped by two Iowa State Troopers. Before that stop was over, the officers had seized $100,000, which the men said was money to play poker. The troopers also called ahead to California authorities, who raided the men's homes and ultimately indicted one of them, John Newmerzhycky, on a charge of illegal possession of drug paraphernalia. If this sounds unusual and way out of the ordinary, it isn't.   The seizure is just one of thousands of highway stops that state and local authorities call ""interdictions:"" Roadside stops aimed at catching drug dealers or even terrorists, but which can also result in cash seizures alone with no criminal charges attached. It's called Civil Asset Forfeiture, and it was started in the early 1980s by the Justice Department. It has since migrated to thousands of state and local jurisdictions nationwide. The program, when it originated, was meant to target and take money authorities believed was connected to crimes. A legal advocacy group based in Washington called the Institute for Justice has been battling Civil Asset Forfeiture for years. ""It violates due process for Americans,"" said Larry Salzman, an attorney for the group. ""It's wrong. It's a simple premise that the government should not be taking money from people who have done nothing wrong.  It shouldn't be taking money from people who have not been charged, let alone convicted, of any crime."" In the case of the two poker players in Iowa, months after their money was taken, they reached a settlement in which most of the money —$90,000 — was returned.  They told CNN they believed it was the best deal they could have made at the time.  Now, however, they are suing to get the rest of the money back and have asked for unspecified damages.  The state of Iowa isn't giving it back and is not backing down. ""It has had widespread and deep impacts on my life,"" said William ""Bart"" Davis, one of the two poker players.  ""It's my primary focus right now.  It's made me aware of the things I was unaware of.  And made me angry."" Other examples are rife. In a small Nevada county two hours driving time east of Reno, a single deputy sheriff has been responsible for more than a dozen cash seizures in 2014 alone, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of motorists whose money was taken. That deputy, Lee Dove, asks one motorist in a dash-cam video how much money he has on hand.   When the driver answers, Dove said, quote, ""It's not counted is it?  Well, I'm seizing it."" Dove was so proud of his cash seizures that he autographed photos of himself with a bundle of money at his feet, accompanied by his K-9 dog. CNN wanted to ask him about the seizures but he didn't answer when our team approached his security gate just after nightfall.   As we were driving away a few minutes later, two Humboldt County Sheriff's deputies pulled us over even though we hadn't done anything wrong.   One of them said their colleague, Dove, ""had been going through a tough time"" and had called them to complain about our presence. The newly elected sheriff in Humboldt County, Mike Allen, said Dove is still with the department but has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of a state investigation. Allen said the entire program is suspended pending that investigation and that any future stops must have a clear connection to criminal activity. ""I want to know what crime they're investigating, and what evidence do they have to substantiate that crime before any property is seized, "" Allen said. The Justice Department recently said it was backing away from the civil asset forfeiture actions it had been taking for nearly three decades.  Its records show it seized more than $6 million in the most recent fiscal year.  Now, the department says it won't benefit from most seizures any longer. ""With this new policy, effective immediately, the Justice Department is taking an important step to prohibit federal agency adoptions of state and local seizures, except for public safety reasons,"" said Attorney General Eric Holder. Critics like the Institute for Justice, however, say that doesn't mean the elimination of the practice. The institute's president, Scott Bullock predicted it will continue in most states around the country.","Local authorities have seized property from motorists not charged with anything .

"(CNN)The neighborhoods look like those in many European cities. Restaurants and shops abound. There's a mix of new and old. Cars and buses shuttle from here to there. And people crowd the streets, the only thing distinct about them being that they look more diverse than some other places. These are places to go, locals say -- not ""no-go zones,"" as described by a Fox News commentator as well as Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. The last few weeks have seen characterizations of some European cities as inordinately full of Muslims, areas where a woman without a veil might feel too scared to explore, areas that police largely avoid, and where Sharia law rules the day. This storyline has struck a nerve in place like the British city of Birmingham and the Belleville neighborhood of Paris, coming on the heels of terror attacks in France that killed 17 and stirred worries around Europe. It's left some angry, dismissive or incredulous, unsure of what to make of it all. Who are these people, they ask, making sweeping, damning assessments of their hometowns from thousands of miles away? ""When I heard this, frankly I choked on my porridge, and I thought it was April Fools' Day,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron told network ITV, referring specifically to Fox News commentator Steve Emerson's remarks. ""This guy is clearly a complete idiot."" The central English city of Birmingham has a long and proud history, from Stone Age-era natives to Roman conquerors to medieval markets and more. Today, the city is home to more than 1 million people -- who, partly due to its universities, are younger than England's overall population with 45.7% under age 30. Birmingham is also relatively diverse, with about 42% of its citizens being not white and 22% born outside the country. In terms of religion, just over 46% of residents are Christian, just under 22% are Muslim, and about 19% have no religion. It is not as Emerson described it earlier this month: ""There are actually cities like Birmingham that are totally Muslim, where non-Muslims simply don't go in."" This assertion is wrong, as Emerson and Fox later admitted. But that doesn't mean it didn't sting. Britain's Press Association talked to several people in Birmingham, some of whom called such claims ridiculous, others who dismissed them as misconceptions, and one called it simply ignorant. ""We are not in cuckoo land,"" Raja Mohammed Ishtiaq, co-owner of the Raja Brothers market founded by Pakistani immigrants, told the Guardian. ""There are lots of Muslims here, but this is a multicultural society and there are beautiful links between the different religions. How can they say this? Birmingham is one of the stable communities."" Some poked fun at the remarks on Twitter, with one claiming ""the British army ... sent snow to make Birmingham white again"" and another showing a picture of a bingo hall called ""Mecca."" Joked one man: ""Was a bit surprised that I had to convert to the Muslim faith before they'd let me off the train at Birmingham the other day."" Birmingham wasn't the only British city caught up in the controversy. So, too, was the capital, London. Emerson, for one, talked about ""no-go zones"" around England. And during a speech in London, Jindal said that ""in the West, non-assimilationist Muslims establish enclaves and carry out as much of Sharia law as they can without regard for the laws of the democratic countries which provided them a new home."" ""It is startling to think that any country would allow, even unofficially, for a so-called 'no-go zone,'"" he said. ""The idea that a free country would allow for specific areas of its country to operate in an autonomous way that is not free and is in direct opposition to its laws is hard to fathom."" Jindal later doubled-down on the comments, telling CNN's Max Foster that ""there are people here in London that will tell you there are neighborhoods where women don't feel safe ... without veils"" and ""where police are less likely to go."" A CNN crew went out to Newham, the London borough with the largest Muslim population, and found people who thought the Republican governor's remarks were not based in reality. They said they felt safe and comfortable in a community that looked like many other parts of the city. Ken Marsh, who represents London's police union, was similarly disbelieving. ""This is not something we recognize at all,"" Marsh said. ""We don't have areas in London that are no-go. We don't have areas in London that are Sharia law only. And we police all areas of London."" This debate unfolded hundreds of miles from the place that got the world talking about it in the first place: Paris. That's where two Islamist extremists stormed the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine January 7, leaving 12 dead. A policewoman in the Paris suburb of Montrouge was killed a day later. The next day, the national nightmare climaxed in a pair of raids that killed three terrorists, on top of the four civilians dead after a hostage siege at a kosher market in eastern Paris. These events and their ties to an extreme, twisted and violent form of Islam made what's happening in France a talking point for commentators worldwide. Some of that media buzz drew the ire of French nationals, in particular Fox News for Emerson's comments and segments suggesting there are parts of Paris and other European cities where Islamic law is practiced and where police are fearful to work. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo went so far as to lay out plans to sue Fox News for having ""insulted"" her city. ""The image of Paris has been prejudiced,"" she told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""And the honor of Paris has been prejudiced."" Not everyone in France is rallying around Charlie Hebdo, especially after it published a cartoon depicting the Prophet Mohammed after the attacks. Teacher Eric Betencourt told CNN that many of his Muslim students felt the magazine's staff had some responsibility for what happened, saying, ""they continued doing what they were doing in full knowledge of the risks."" Yet even if the entire country isn't on the same page when it comes to the satirical magazine, that doesn't mean some places are isolated -- at least when it comes to police patrolling the streets or whether anyone, including women without veils, feel welcome on them. CNN's Laura Akhoun grew up in the Paris neighborhood of Belleville, which has a large number of Muslims and immigrants. She describes it as a lively place where rent is a little cheaper, items at the market cost a little less, and people feel welcome, wherever they come from. People who are there now echo that view, saying they feel safe, comfortable and happy to live somewhere that people of all ethnicities and religions call home. It's no wonder then, that some proud French nationals felt disgusted by the idea of outsiders casting aspersions on such neighborhoods as dangerous places.

"(CNN)The 911 caller in Tel Aviv sounded panicked, his voice loud and urgent. ""She was stabbed in the head!"" Go to Hamasger Street, the caller shouted. A man stabbed nine people, including the driver of a bus and passengers on Wednesday, in what police are calling a terror attack. The girl, was she conscious? the 911 operator asked. ""Yes, yes, she is crying, she is conscious,"" the caller answered. The attacker was a 23-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank city of Tulkarem, authorities said. Police shot him in the leg after he got off the bus. He was arrested and is being questioned, they said. The suspect was identified as Hamzeh Matrouk, said Israeli authorities and the suspect's family. His uncle, Ahmad Matrouk, said his nephew lives with his mother in the West Bank city of Ramallah. The suspect's father lives in another West Bank city, Tulkarem, where the uncle was interviewed by CNN. ""Hamzeh has no political affiliation,"" the uncle said. ""We were called by the Israeli military to come in for questioning. His father, mother and myself, we went and they were asking us about his political affiliation. We said that Hamzeh never had any political affiliation."" When asked what could be a motive for the suspect's attack, the uncle said it was ""because of what he sees of suffering of the Palestinians by Israel. The daily attacks by the extremist Jews and Israelis on the Aqsa mosque and especially this summer the killing of more than 2,100 Palestinians by Israel in Gaza."" The suspect works as an electrician supporting his mother and his younger brothers, the uncle said. ""He came to see his father last night and his friends last night, and he was in his nature nothing suspicious,"" the uncle said. The uncle said his nephew, born in late 1992, was age 22, not 23 as authorities reported. Israeli authorities couldn't be immediately reached for comment to clarify the suspect's age, but a government website stated the suspect was born in 1992, was originally from Tulkarem, and had no prior arrests. Witnesses and police say that when the attacker boarded the bus and stabbed the driver and a few passengers, the driver tried to fight back by spraying the assailant with pepper spray, veering the bus, pumping the brakes and opening the doors. Some passengers were able to get out and get away. The attacker ran after them and stabbed a few people on his way out of the bus. Prison guards who were in their car behind the bus got out of their vehicle and chased the assailant, witnesses and police said. The attacker was shot in the leg and apprehended. Four victims were seriously wounded, according to emergency responders. Five people were either lightly or moderately injured, emergency services said. Several other passengers were treated for shock. One person was severely injured, officials told CNN, and the attacker remains in moderate condition at a Tel Aviv hospital. The terror of the victims and the chaos during the attack was captured in other 911 calls. An injured woman can be heard telling an operator, ""My body is covered with blood."" In a separate call, another woman says, ""I have here a wounded man who is heavily bleeding, someone has to come for help, he is bleeding from the head from his neck, that is what I see."" The operator tells her to find a clean piece of cloth and press it against the man's wounds. A Hamas spokesman, Izzat al-Risheq, who is based in Qatar, praised the attack, according to the Times of Israel and Haaretz. ""The heroic stabbing incident against the Zionist in Tel Aviv is a daring and heroic act,"" he reportedly said.  ""It comes as a natural response to the terrorist occupation crimes against our people."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired back, casting a net of blame around Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, which together form a unity government. ""The terrorist attack in Tel Aviv is the direct result of the poisonous incitement being disseminated by the Palestinian Authority against the Jews and their state. This same terrorism is trying to attack us in Paris, Brussels and everywhere."" The U.S. Embassy in Israel, on its website, said that due to security concerns on Israel's northern border, all U.S. government personnel must get advance approval to travel within 1.5 miles of the Lebanese border or east of Route 98 in the Golan Heights. And, it said, in light of the bus attack, U.S. government employees are prohibited from using public buses throughout Israel and the West Bank. There has been a string of attacks against Israeli residents in recent months. Here is a look at a few of them: . -- A Palestinian man threw acid on an Israeli family near a Jerusalem checkpoint in December, Israeli authorities said. -- A teenage Palestinian girl with a knife stabbed an Israeli man in the West Bank, Israeli police said. --Two Palestinian cousins stormed a Jerusalem synagogue in mid-November with a gun and butcher's knives, killing five. They were shot dead by police. -- Days later, Israeli authorities said they foiled a plot by Palestinians to assassinate Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman. -- More than a week earlier, attackers stabbed one Israeli soldier to death in Tel Aviv and three more Israelis near a West Bank settlement, the IDF said. One of the West Bank victims also died. -- In early November, a Palestinian man driving a van plowed into pedestrians at a train stop in eastern Jerusalem, killing two. Another 12 people were injured. The man died in police gunfire after also attacking people with a metal bar, police said. -- In October, a Palestinian man rammed his car into commuters waiting at a light rail stop in Jerusalem, killing a baby and wounding several other people, Israeli police said. The driver of the vehicle was shot as he tried to flee and later died. -- Also in October, according to a Palestinian state news report, an Israeli man killed a 5-year-old Palestinian girl when he ran her down in a car as she walked home from kindergarten. The attack reportedly also injured a second 5-year-old girl. CNN's Amir Tal, Michael Schwartz and Kareem Khadder in Jerusalem contributed to this report.","Israeli military interviews suspect's family about his political ties, uncle says .

"(CNN)""I did not kill! I did not kill!"" a woman shrieks as Saudi police wrap her head with a black scarf. ""Praise God,"" a Saudi executioner dressed in white tells her. He lifts his long silver sword and strikes her neck -- a gasp, then she falls silent. Twice more the hangman hacks at her neck, before stepping away to carefully wipe the blade. Ambulance workers immediately start placing the woman's remains on a stretcher as charges against her are hurriedly read out over a loud speaker in the Muslim holy city of Mecca. She was accused of raping her seven-year-old stepdaughter with a broomstick and beating her to death. ""A royal decree was issued to carry out the sharia law, in accordance with what is right,"" the statement says. Cell phone footage of the execution, leaked last week by activists, gives a rare glimpse into what human rights groups call a barbaric practice of public decapitation as a punitive measure handed down by Saudi Arabia's judicial system. The country executed 87 people in 2014, most by beheading, Human Rights Watch told CNN. Saudi officials told CNN the punishment is an integral part of their system of Islamic law, and the only violation that took place at the macabre scene was the illegal filming of the act. The man responsible for the recording now faces charges of violating the country's cyber laws and will be tried, a Saudi official not authorized to speak on the case said. ""We emphasize respect for the right to life as one of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the law. It should not make us forget the rights of other parties violated by the perpetrators, which has to be seen with the same degree of respect, Mohammed al-Muadi, of the government backed Saudi Human Rights Commission told CNN when asked specifically about the practice of beheading. The oil-rich kingdom appears unyielding to international pressure, but domestically, a quiet debate is ongoing between hardline conservatives and more moderate members of the legal community, experts tell CNN. Abdulaziz Algasim, a former sharia law judge, said: ""From a pure Islamic law point of view there is no limitation for developing capital punishment."" But he said that methods such as lethal injection may be considered in coming years. ""There is dialogue in the jurisprudence society that another alternative action can achieve the goal with more mercy, and fit better with human rights."" A project inaugurated by the ruling King Abdullah to put laws into writing has ushered in a shift from the current uncodified system, which provides judges with little guideline or precedence. ""This is all part of big issue of division. The sharia court led by conservatives wants to keep the regulation away from the influence of the political regime, so they are very sensitive,"" Algasim says,  ""On the other side, the modernization has to be achieved and it needs a lot of development in the public policy if you want to develop a way to measure punishment and establish a more humanized alternative.""

"Beijing (CNN)A New Year's Eve stampede in Shanghai that killed 36 people and injured 49 others was ""totally preventable,"" local officials said Wednesday. ""We feel very sad and extremely guilty,"" Vice Mayor Zhou Bo told a nationally televised press conference. ""We offer our deepest condolences to the victims, and express our deepest apologies to their families as well as the injured and their families."" An investigating team said the stampede happened at 11:35 p.m. local time when huge crowds trying to reach the iconic riverfront promenade, known as the Bund, clashed with others attempting to leave on a staircase. Most of the victims were in their 20s with the youngest being only 12 years old. Of the injured, three remained in a serious condition in hospital as of Wednesday. Investigators blamed various government agencies of the city's Huangpu district, whose jurisdiction includes the Bund, for the fatal incident. They said local officials were ""ill-prepared"" for the crowds and ""mishandled"" the aftermath. Although the district authorities had earlier called off a popular riverfront light show on New Year's Eve, thousands of revelers -- unaware of the cancellation due to the lack of official updates -- still flocked to the Bund, investigators said. They singled out the district police department for severely underestimating the crowd size -- which had reached 310,000 people by midnight -- and assigning fewer than 600 officers and other security personnel to the area. Three top district officials in Huangpu have been sacked  -- the local Communist Party boss, his deputy and the district police chief, and a total of 11 officials face punishment for their role in the incident. In a nod to public criticism, the ruling Communist Party's disciplinary arm in Shanghai also confirmed on Wednesday that several Huangpu district officials -- including the fired Communist boss and his deputy -- violated Party regulations by wining and dining for free at a high-end Japanese restaurant on the Bund shortly before the stampede. After Chinese President Xi Jinping warned officials about public safety following the stampede, authorities across the country have rushed to cancel large gatherings, ranging from pop concerts to shopping festivals. But Zhou, Shanghai's vice mayor, said that, after careful risk assessments, officials have green-lighted most planned events in the city for the upcoming Chinese New Year celebrations in February -- though the popular lantern festival at the ancient City Temple won't go ahead.","Shanghai officials say New Year's Eve stamped that killed 35 ""totally preventable""

"London (CNN)Mohamedou Slahi was wearing black-out goggles. A guard dragged him onto a boat and someone forced him to drink seawater. ""It was so nasty I threw up...They stuffed the air between my clothes and me with ice cubes from my neck to my ankles...every once in a while one of the guards smashed me, most of the time in the face."" In a new book Guantánamo Diary, Slahi paints a horrifying picture of life at the hands of interrogators in the notorious U.S. military prison in Cuba. The book depicts long days in isolation, sometimes chained to the floor in agonizing positions, held in extreme temperatures, often deprived of food and sleep. On multiple occasions he describes being beaten and humiliated by his questioners. He says he was left ""shaking like a Parkinson's patient"" and felt one of his interrogators ""was literally executing me but in a slow way."" The 44-year-old electrical engineer, originally from Mauritania, has been held in Guantánamo Bay since 2002. He was accused of being a member of al Qaeda and of recruiting three of the hijackers in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as well as being involved in other terror plots in Canada and the United States. He's never been charged and his lawyers say there is very little evidence against him. Slahi admits to traveling to Afghanistan to fight in the early 1990s, when the U.S. was supporting the mujahedeen in their fight against the Soviet Union. He pledged allegiance to al Qaeda in 1991 but claims he broke ties with the group shortly after. The U.S. military continues to hold Slahi as an enemy combatant under the Authorization for the Use of Military Force of 2001 informed by the laws of war, according to Department of Defense spokesman Lt. Col. Myles Caggins. Guantánamo Diary is the first published account from a serving detainee which is being made available to the public. Slahi hand-wrote the manuscript in his cell in 2005 and it took nearly seven years for Slahi's lawyers to get it approved for release. He describes his first few years of detention in what he calls his ""endless world tour"" of interrogation from Mauritania, to Jordan, to Afghanistan and finally Cuba. In his early years at Guantánamo, Slahi was exposed to a number of special interrogation techniques that were personally signed off by then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, according to reports by the Armed Services Committee and the Department of Justice. That included sensory and sleep deprivation, designed to grind him down, which wreaked havoc on his physical and mental health. ""I couldn't tell a thing about days going by or time passing; my time consisted of a crazy darkness all the time,"" Slahi writes. ""I was starved for long periods and then given food but not given time to eat... ""You have three minutes. Eat!"" a guard would yell at me, and then after about half a minute he would grab the plate. ""You're done!"""". Slahi says the brutality reached a peak in late 2003. ""I thought they were going to execute me,"" Slahi writes. ""Thanks to the beating I wasn't able to stand, so [redacted] and the other guard dragged me out with my toes tracing the way and threw me in the truck, which immediately took off. The beating party would go on for the next three or four hours."" This period culminated in him being taken on a boat ride during which he was blindfolded and he says beaten for several hours. It was during this time that Slahi says he began to make false confessions in order to stop the torture.  At one point he says to his interrogator ""Just tell me the right answer. Is it good to say yes or to say no?"" Responding to Slahi's allegations of torture, Caggins, the Pentagon spokesman, pointed to a number of investigations into Guantánamo detainee treatment. Many of Slahi's claims are corroborated by reports published by the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee and the Department of Justice in 2008. The boat incident which Slahi describes in detail is mentioned in both reports, although neither provide complete details about what happened during this trip. Caggins also said ""Slahi is eligible to appear before a Periodic Review Board to assess whether his continued detention at Guantanamo remains necessary."" Even in its published form, portions of Slahi's account are redacted.  The U.S. Department of Defense says this was necessary to protect U.S. personnel and national security. In some sections of the book, several pages at a time are completely blacked out. Slahi's lawyers hope the book will build pressure on the government to finally let him go. In 2010 a district court judge ruled he was being held unlawfully and ordered his immediate release. But the government appealed that decision and the case has been in legal limbo ever since. ""Unfortunately for the government -- and fortunately for the rest of us -- these secrets are out now,"" Slahi's lawyer, Nancy Hollander, told CNN. ""The United States can't keep secret these things that it does any longer -- and it needs to close Guantanamo. It's as simple as that."" When U.S. President Barack Obama took office in 2008 he promised to close Guantánamo, but as he enters his seventh year in the White House 122 prisoners remain. At its peak there were more than 700. In Tuesday's State of the Union address Obama said his administration will work to finally ""finish the job"" and close it down. ""As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice - so it makes no sense to spend $3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit,"" Obama said. ""I will not relent in my determination to shut it down.  It's not who we are. It's time to close Gitmo.""","Mohamedou Slahi's harrowing story is the first time a serving Gitmo inmate has been published .

"(CNN)In A.D. 79, Mount Vesuvius erupted and buried the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Almost 2,000 years later, researchers may be on the brink of reading some of the charred scrolls damaged in the eruption. The scrolls, which were buried in a Herculaneum library and excavated 260 years ago, are easily damaged or destroyed by unwrapping, so researchers have been unable to read them without risk. But by using X-ray phase contrast tomography -- a 3-D technique used in medicine for soft biological tissue -- they have been able to reveal writing on the tightly wrapped scrolls without unrolling them, wrote a team led by Vito Mocella of the Naples-based Institute for Microelectronics and Microsystems of the National Council of Research. Their research was described in the journal Nature Communications. ""This attempt opens up new opportunities to read many Herculaneum papyri, which are still rolled up, thus enhancing our knowledge of ancient Greek literature and philosophy,"" they wrote. The Herculaneum library, which was uncovered in the 1750s, is the only ancient library to survive with its books, the researchers point out. The scrolls are primarily philosophical texts. The team looked at two scrolls given to Napoleon in 1802, burnt by volcanic gases reaching about 600 degrees Fahrenheit, and were able to discern a handful of Greek letters through the X-ray technology. Though difficult to make out, ""the letters are there in relief, because the ink is still on the top (of the papyrus),"" Mocella told the BBC. There's still a long way to go to completely read the texts of the scrolls, but scholars are optimistic. One of them, the University of Michigan's Richard Janko, told The New York Times we might find works thought lost to history. ""This technology, when perfected, does open the way to rediscovering a lot more ancient literature,"" he said.","X-ray technique used in medicine helps reveal ancient writing .

"In designating the al-Nusra Front as a foreign terrorist organization and an offshoot of al Qaeda in Iraq, the U.S. State Department has put flesh on the bones of its policy of discriminating between the ""bad"" Syrian rebels and the ""good"" ones. But the decision is getting mixed reviews in Syria. Rebels in brigades fighting around Aleppo have told CNN that the move is a miscalculation. Their argument goes something like this: ""The U.S. and the West in general have given us next to no help while we've witnessed thousands die at the hands of Bashar al-Assad's heavy weaponry and dominance of the skies. Read more: New head of Syrian opposition briefs European foreign ministers . ""To add insult to injury, Washington has now proscribed one of the most effective fighting forces among rebel groups. We may not share al-Nusra's worldview, but we need their organizational and battlefield experience."" This has translated into resentment and anger toward the United States on the ground, as people ask: ""Al-Nusra are terrorists, but Bashar is not?"" For the United States, the decision is part of a broader effort to support a moderate political opposition in Syria -- one that can be part of an eventual transition to a post-Assad Syria. Read more: Syrian rebels move toward unified command . Without such a presence -- one that can begin to function as a government in waiting -- U.S. policy-makers fear a prolonged war of attrition that will play into the hands of more radical factions while Syria's humanitarian crisis turns into catastrophe. Additionally there is concern among U.S. officials that groups like al-Nusra will make common cause with Sunni militants in Iraq, who would like nothing better than a sympathetic rear base across the Euphrates River. U.S. officials are making the argument that the overall affect of the designation of al-Nusra will be to minimize the group's role in the Syrian opposition while not reducing the fighting capabilities of the rebel groups. ""Al-Nusra Front is one of many groups that are fighting the Syrian regime now, it is not the only one,"" a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday in explaining the designation. ""In fact it is a minority. Its influence has grown in recent months, but it still represents the minority element within the broader armed opposition."" By the estimates of rebel commanders in Syria, al-Nusra (also known as Jabhat al-Nusra) makes up less than 10% of the brigades fighting the regime. Most of its fighters are Syrian. Some waged jihad in Iraq before returning home, though several also spent time in the Bucca prison camp in Iraq, where hundreds of insurgents were held. There is also more than a smattering of foreign fighters in al-Nusra's ranks -- Jordanian, Iraqi, Libyan, a few from Central Asia. U.S. officials also point out that the State Department has designated Syrian groups known as the Shabiha -- paramilitary militias controlled by the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that have attacked and killed opponents of the al-Assad regime. ""Whether the American steps today will immediately curtail al-Nusra's capabilities, I don't think they know,"" the senior administration official said. ""But I think that other nations that are involved in helping the armed opposition will now take more seriously our concerns about the Nusra front."" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Monday: ""We've had concerns that al-Nusra is little more than a front for al Qaeda in Iraq who has moved some of its operations into Syria. ... We do see al Qaeda in Iraq trying to make these inroads."" Some tribal leaders in Iraqi provinces like Anbar are already thought to be funneling money and weapons to Islamist factions across the long border, and al-Nusra has been strong in areas near the Iraqi border. Read more: Syria's chemical weapon potential: What are the health risks? The West appears ready to accept that Islamists loyal to organizations such as the Muslim Brotherhood will be part of the post-Assad scenery. They are well represented in the new Military Council established this week, from which al-Nusra was excluded. Al-Nusra had already boycotted the new political opposition, making common cause with other militant factions. Some analysts believe that al-Nusra is too important on the battlefield, especially in attacking military bases in the Northwest, for other rebel commanders to ostracize it. In the year since al-Nusra emerged, it has carried out a number of complex and coordinated suicide bombings against high-profile regime targets and built a coherent fighting force through a thorough vetting process. By the admission of Free Syrian Army commanders on the ground, al-Nusra was instrumental in the seizure of the Sheikh Suleiman Military Academy near Aleppo this week. A reporter for Agence France-Presse in the area said many of the fighters ""were from other Arab countries and Central Asia."" At another military base, rebel commander Ali Jadlan told CNN that fighters with al-Nusra were among the three brigades laying siege to the military academy. He said they were responsible for the most dangerous area. The group has continued its offensive against the regime with a devastating series of suicide bombings -- most recently claiming responsibility for blowing up a government checkpoint in al Qusayr, and posting before and after photographs on jihadist online forums. The analysts say that only if U.S. designation of al-Nusra were followed by serious weapons supplies to the ""good"" rebels might those rebels change their stance toward the group. While President Barack Obama has not ruled out the option of supplying weapons, officials say there first must be more clarity on the ground. ""For us, providing arms has to be done in a way that helps promote a political solution,"" the senior administration official said. ""Until we understand how these arms promote a political solution, we do not see how provision of arms is a good idea."" Not much is known about al-Nusra's structure or leadership, but its emir, who goes by the nom de guerre of of Abu Muhammad al-Golani, said in an audio message at the beginning of the year that its goal was to make Syria an Islamic state. The group's propaganda frequently tells Syrians that they have been ""abandoned"" by the West. The lesson of history is that revolutions tend to be won by the best organized and most ruthless, rather than the best intentioned and most reasonable. For Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks, organization was as important as ideology. The Taliban swept across Afghanistan as the only coherent force in a country craving order and stability. Egypt's revolution ended up favoring the Muslim Brotherhood as the only political organization tried and tested by decades of repression. Similarly, al-Nusra stands out among Syrian rebel groups as the most effective and disciplined. Al-Nusra has also learned from history, according to other Islamists among Syrian rebel ranks. Many of its more experienced fighters saw al Qaeda in Iraq alienate the Sunni tribes there with its vicious sectarian bloodletting. As Aaron Zelin of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy wrote in Foreign Policy last week, ""Jabhat al-Nusra seems to have learned from the mistakes of al Qaeda in Iraq: It has not attacked civilians randomly, nor has it shown wanton disregard for human life by publicizing videos showing the beheading of its enemies."" Instead, Islamist leaders in Aleppo say, it is looking to broaden its appeal and spread its fundamentalist message. Ordinary people in Aleppo complain that some FSA units mishandle or misappropriate bread distribution, and they have begun to look to Islamist groups for greater honesty in managing local affairs. One chant recently heard in Aleppo, revealingly, was this: ""We don't want a thieving free army, we want an Islamic army."" The United States would rather see that role in the hands of the Local Coordination Committees, present in many Syrian cities since early in the uprising. Such is the undercurrent of resentment toward the United States among Syrians pummeled by nearly two years of regime attacks that designating al-Nusra may have the unintended consequence of making it more popular. Designation may also make it more attractive to foreign jihadists. According to the SITE Intelligence Group, another jihadist group, the al-Sahaba Army, has already congratulated al-Nusra for its designation, describing it as a ""great honor"" and calling on other groups to rally to al-Nusra. For now, the group has no formal affiliation with al Qaeda, and according to other Islamist fighters it is probably wary of being pigeonholed as part of the group, for fear of causing a backlash among a population that historically is among the less conservative in the Arab world. One leading Islamist in Aleppo described al-Nusra as similar to jihadist groups in Iraq before they morphed into al Qaeda. So far, he said, al-Nusra has yet to receive al Qaeda's seal of approval. The U.S. State Department thinks otherwise.","U.S. State Department has added al-Nusra Front in Syria to its list of terrorist organizations .

"Gov. Chris Christie has a big decision to make come December: Anger the governor of Iowa, who holds significant power in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary contest, or anger basically everyone else. The New Jersey governor, who's seriously mulling a bid for president, will have to decide whether to veto a bill that would ban the use of pig gestation crates, small metal containers that confine breeding sows for essentially their whole adult lives. Critics consider the crates a form of animal cruelty -- the pigs aren't able to turn around in the limited space -- while advocates say they prevent sows from accidentally lying down or stepping on piglets. What are gestation crates? Despite having strong, bipartisan support in the state legislature, Christie vetoed a version of the bill in 2013. He's now facing mounting pressure from activists and celebrities, including Bill Maher, Danny DeVito, Martha Stewart and Edie Falco. The conservative news outlet National Review published a column by Bruce Friedrich, director of advocacy and policy for Farm Sanctuary, a national farm-animal protection organization, outlining a conservative case for Christie to ban the practice. But for Christie, the problem comes down to politics. While New Jersey's pork industry isn't very big and the ban would largely be symbolic, the pork industry is huge in Iowa. (There were 9,000 pigs in New Jersey last year, compared to 20.5 million in Iowa, according to the USDA.) Gov. Terry Branstad, who recently won re-election in the Hawkeye State, told the Associated Press that he urged Christie to veto the bill last year. ""I called him to tell him how bad I thought it would be and how the people that are involved in pork production, that really understand this, feel this would be very bad,""  Branstad said, reiterating the argument that the crates protect baby pigs from much larger adult pigs. Branstad said they discussed the most recent version of the bill when Christie was in Iowa last month for a fundraiser for Iowa Republicans. It's unclear what Christie will do with the bill. Last year, in his veto message, Christie said the decision should be made by the state's Department of Agriculture. ""The proper balancing of the humane treatment of gestating pigs with the interests of farmers whose livelihood depends on their ability to properly manage their livestock best rests with the state's farming experts â€” the State Board and the Department,"" he said. Confronted about it at a town hall earlier this year, Christie said he felt that farmers had a better argument than animal rights activists. ""If a bill comes back, I will certainly consider any additional evidence that people want to put in front of me,"" he said.","Chris Christie is facing pressure from Iowa on a controversial bill involving pigs .

"(CNN)Madonna says Israeli police have arrested a hacker who stole unfinished versions of her newest songs and leaked them online. ""I am profoundly grateful to the FBI, the Israeli Police investigators and anyone else who helped lead to the arrest of this hacker,"" the pop singer said in a statement posted on her Facebook page Wednesday. ""I deeply appreciate my fans who have provided us with pertinent information and continue to do so regarding leaks of my music."" An undercover Israeli police investigation in collaboration with the FBI led to the suspect, Israeli police spokeswoman Luba Samri said. ""The Tel Aviv resident, born in 1976, was believed to have stolen work from a number of artists and sold it online,"" Samri said. ""We have confiscated many materials and computer equipment from the suspect's house and investigations are still under way."" The stolen material included ""songs that haven't yet been released, sketches of songs, photos and other personal material,"" Tamir Afori, Madonna's attorney in Israel, told Haaretz. The theft cost the Queen of Pop millions of dollars in professional and personal damages, he told the newspaper. According to Haaretz, the suspect is a 38-year-old man who was set to be arraigned on charges of intellectual property theft and aggravated fraud. The FBI said its investigation would continue. ""This case highlights the international scope of online criminal activity and the need for close cooperation between nations as we collectively identify and bring to justice those who pose a threat in cyberspace,"" the FBI said. Madonna's next album, ""Rebel Heart,"" is set for release in March. After the songs leaked in December, a photo of broken iPod appeared on Madonna's Instagram feed. ""This broken ipod is a symbol of my broken heart! That my music has been stolen and leaked! I have been violated as a human and an artist!"" she wrote. Leaks have tormented Madonna in the past.

"(CNN)Two bodies have been found in the ruins of an Annapolis, Maryland, mansion that burned two days ago, Anne Arundel County fire officials said Wednesday at a press conference. Technology executive Don Pyle, his wife and four grandchildren are feared dead in the fire. Officials said the two bodies have not been identified. For the first time since the fire broke out on Monday, local and federal officials were able to secure the structure and access the foundation of the 16,000-square-foot house. Cadaver dogs led them to the bodies, officials said. Officials would not comment on the age range of the victims found, nor would they discuss where they were located or the possible cause of death. Authorities are treating the house as a crime scene. Officials said this is standard procedure for a case like this and no evidence has been found to indicate suspicious activity. The waterfront house belonged to Pyle, chief operating officer for ScienceLogic, company spokesman Antonio Piraino said. Pyle was believed to have been at home with his wife, Sandy, and four grandchildren. The sheer size of the structure and the fact that three-fourths of the building had collapsed into the basement, with piles of deep-seeded debris still smoldering, compounded the search, Anne Arundel County Fire Capt. Robert Howarth said Tuesday. He is leading the investigation along with a team from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. ""Your looking at five standard houses put together,"" he said Tuesday. ""This is more of a commercial fire than it is a residential fire. There are a lot of businesses that aren't 16,000 square feet. That adds to it."" Pyle had not been heard from on Monday, and his colleagues at ScienceLogic were ""hoping for a miracle,"" CNN affiliate WJLA-TV in Washington reported. Heavy equipment was brought in to aid in the search for victims and clues -- a process that could take days. ""We have some very unique challenges with this house,"" Howarth said. ""The construction of the house contained a lot of very heavy materials. We're looking at some steel beams that weigh in the area of 7 tons."" When the first firefighters arrived on the scene early Monday, they received conflicting reports about whether the family may have been out of town. But after interviews with relatives, it was determined that six members of the family were not accounted for, Anne Arundel County fire officials said. ""We still do not have 100% proof that they're in this house,"" Howarth said. Fire officials said they were alerted to the fire about 3:30 a.m. Monday. About 80 firefighters responded. The ATF national response team responded because the fire was deemed suspicious, Howarth said. The fire department said crews had difficulty knocking down the blaze because the house is secluded, apparently with no fire hydrants on the scene. Photos the fire department posted on Twitter showed hoses stretched for long distances. Capt. Russ Davies, Anne Arundel County fire spokesman, said it took hours for fire department tanker trucks and a fire boat on an adjacent creek to bring the fire under control. Pyle's company bio described him as a industry veteran who has held multiple CEO positions,  with more than 25 years' experience in information technology infrastructure software and hardware management. Pyle told The Washington Post last year that after holding positions in a family business, he decided to look for an ""industry that was in its infancy and something that would have growth potential."" He started in a sales position in a firm that connected computers over transmission lines, and later sold both hardware and software components for the Internet. Pyle told the newspaper he eventually moved from sales to sales management to general management positions. In 1992, the company went public and was sold to Cisco Systems five years later for $4.2 billion, according to the Post.

"(CNN) -- A 62-year-old man man was arrested early Thursday and faces criminal mischief charges for allegedly applying a herbicide commonly used to kill trees and brush to landmark 130-year-old live oaks on the edge of the Auburn University campus in east-central Alabama, police said. Harvey Updyke Jr. was taken into custody at the Auburn Police Department, Police Chief Tommy Dawson told reporters. Updyke was being held on a felony first-degree criminal mischief charge on $50,000 bond, said Maj. Tommy Carter of the Lee County Sheriff's Office. A preliminary hearing has not been scheduled. Dawson released few details, saying he did not want to jeopardize the investigation. He said he believes Updyke acted alone and he does not anticipate further arrests, although he said additional charges may be filed. The poisonings -- which came to light after a man called a Birmingham, Alabama, radio show and said he had poisoned the trees -- came as a heartbreaking shock to Auburn fans. For generations, they have thronged to the trees at Toomer's Corner, at the edge of campus, after victories to ""roll"" the trees with toilet paper. The latest significant celebration was after the Auburn Tigers defeated Oregon for the national football championship on January 10. Toomer's Corner is named after a historic drugstore at the opposite corner of the intersection. A man identifying himself as ""Al from Dadeville"" called ""The Paul Finebaum Show"" on January 27 and said, ""Let me tell you what I did the weekend after the Iron Bowl (the annual Auburn-University of Alabama game). I went to Auburn, Alabama, because I live 30 miles away. And I poisoned the two Toomer's trees."" ""They're not dead yet, but they definitely will die,"" the caller said, adding he didn't care if his actions were against the law. ""Al"" ended his call with ""Roll Damn Tide"" -- a variation of the Alabama's ""Roll Tide"" rallying cry. Auburn defeated Alabama 28-27 in Tuscaloosa on November 26, 2010. ""Al"" mentioned a jersey with Auburn quarterback Cam Newton's number placed on the statue of former Alabama coach Paul ""Bear"" Bryant at the time of the 2010 game. He also claimed he had a newspaper article showing Auburn students rolling Toomer's Corner after Bryant's death in January 1983. Finebaum told CNN Thursday that he's never heard of the Bryant death story. Auburn University spokesman Mike Clardy said ""by all accounts it did not happen."" Asked why ""Al"" might have called the show, Finebaum said that ""he was boastful. I don't think he cared."" Over the years, the host has gotten many calls about football and rivalries, but ""this is the low point,"" Finebaum said. ""Most people are horrified by it, but some people aren't losing any sleep,"" he said of the incident. Alex Bell, who screens calls for Finebaum, said the caller initially told him he was an Alabama fan and wanted to discuss the rivalry. But the caller then told him in detail about the poisoning. ""We deal with some crazy people, but when he mentioned the chemical and how he had done it, it was alarming to me,"" Bell said. Finebaum's program is a regionally syndicated sports talk show. Updyke's full name is Harvey Almorn Updyke, CNN affiliate WTVM reported. He made his first court appearance Thursday. The caller said he had used Spike 80DF, which was found when the soil was tested after the university learned of the radio show call. Thirty-three soil samples were taken the next day and were sent for testing. The expedited, final results that came back February 11 showed the levels of Spike 80DF are ""very lethal,"" according to the school. The substance has never been used at Auburn, horticulture professor Gary Keever told reporters Thursday. The substance is manufactured by Dow Chemical. A representative from Dow is advising the university on removal procedures, and expert horticulturalists also are being consulted, according to Auburn. Auburn spokeswoman Deedie Dowdle said Thursday that the university ""was taking a great deal of action"" in the days after receiving the results, but delayed making a public announcement because of the police investigation. The university said in a statement released Wednesday the trees had been poisoned. Asked Thursday whether the trees will die, Stephen Enloe, assistant professor of agronomy and soils at Auburn, grew emotional. ""I always want to hold out hope,"" he said, but the concentration of the herbicide translates into ""a very low probability"" of survival. He said it was unclear how long the trees could last before dying. Experts were re-evaluating soil samples and have applied liquid activated charcoal that can bind with the herbicide and inactivate it. They will also study whether an ""excavator vacuum"" can be used to take out some of the soil, Keever said. Offers of help have poured in from across the nation, from tree farmers, experts and others, officials said. A license is not required to purchase Spike80DF in Alabama, but ""it's not widely available,"" Enloe said, and ""it's not extremely cheap."" It is usually used to control vegetation on right of ways or along fence rows or to maintain bare ground near some industrial facilities, Enloe said. ""It's very effective at what it does, and that is to kill most plants."" The herbicide could spread through the soil and affect other nearby plants, including a white oak and magnolia trees, Keever said. Tom McCauley, with the university's Department of Risk Management and Safety, said there is ""very little chance"" it will affect groundwater for drinking water purposes. University President Jay Gogue and Police Chief Dawson told Auburn fans to act with class. ""This is the exception rather than the rule,"" Dawson said Thursday. ""This is a person who obviously has problems, to do something like this, so we want to use caution and let the justice system take its course.""

"Washington (CNN)A pillar of President Barack Obama's global anti-terrorism strategy is in peril as sectarian chaos consumes Yemen, a vital U.S. ally where chronic instability allows the deadliest surviving al Qaeda franchise to flourish. Iran-backed rebels of the Shiite Houthi sect sparked alarm in Washington after seizing a presidential palace in the volatile Sunni-majority nation, in what officials called a coup. There are now signs that the rebels -- which have been resistant to American anti-terror efforts despite a common antipathy to al Qaeda --  and the U.S.-backed government of President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi have agreed a deal to end the crisis. But the situation remains volatile and a reminder of how the intricate, shifting and treacherous tribal and sectarian divides of the Middle East often confound U.S. efforts to frame coherent anti-terror policy. Obama has spent much of his administration sponsoring a political transition designed to restore stability in Yemen and to cap the sectarianism that sustains al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Washington has offered counter-terrorism training to the government in the Yemeni capital Sanaa and has also mounted a campaign of drone strikes against key AQAP leaders. The group is regarded by U.S. officials as the most potent offspring of Osama bin Laden's jihadist movement and has claimed responsibility for the attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo this month. AQAP also almost succeeded in bringing down a United States commercial jet over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009, and has tried to attack the U.S. mainland on at least two other occasions. The group's potential was underlined in a video released on Wednesday in which a senior leader of AQAP in Yemen, Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi, said it was better for jihadists to wage war in their home nations, rather than fighting on the front lines in Syria. The message will alarm Western governments fearful that Muslim extremists radicalized at home or who have fought in Syria, Iraq or Yemen are plotting new attacks in the wake of the Paris carnage. RELATED: Yemeni government, rebels reach tentative agreement, source says . CNN's Brian Todd reported that meanwhile, ISIS -- al Qaeda's jihadist rival -- was now also beginning to establish a presence in the country. Yemen, which borders the Red Sea and the strategically important Gulf of Aden -- a major oil transit route -- sits next to key U.S. allies, Saudi Arabia and Oman. But it is also important rhetorically for the Obama administration. In a speech in September on combating ISIS, Obama held up U.S. operations in Yemen as an example for a new anti-terror doctrine which does not rely on sending troops into dangerous foreign quagmires. ""This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines, is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years,"" Obama said. Obama vowed to use ""force against anyone who threatens America's core interests, but to mobilize partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international order."" The obvious problem with that strategy is that it needs secure, powerful local partners to have a hope of working. In failed states like Syria and Yemen, those partners often do not exist, or are, like Hadi, are deeply vulnerable. Stephen Seche, a former career foreign service officer, who served as U.S. Ambassador to Yemen between 2007 and 2010, said the current situation was bad news for the White House. ""The Hadi government has been a good partner of ours in the counter-terrorism arena,"" he said. ""If you move President Hadi from the equation, then I think all bets are off in many respects."" After fighting raged in the streets of Sanaa, and a U.S. diplomatic vehicle was caught in the crossfire, the Pentagon moved two ships within range of the country in case the State Department gives the order for an evacuation of the embassy. With memories of the raid by extremists on U.S. compounds in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012, which killed four Americans still haunting the administration, and fears of a hostage drama, no one wants to take chances. SEE ALSO: ISIS gaining ground in Yemen . But the White House faces a tough decision as it seeks to preserve limited influence that it still has on the ground in Yemen. ""If we were forced to close down in Sanaa, the embassy, this would be a major foreign policy defeat,"" CNN intelligence analyst Robert Baer told Wolf Blitzer. ""We need a government in that country to crack down on al Qaeda. You cannot do this from the air, or the National Security Agency [cannot just] intercept intelligence. ""We need a strong central government -- whether it is a Houthi one or an independent one."" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday that the safety of embassy personnel in Sanaa was a top priority. He also made clear that preserving anti-terror cooperation in Yemen was also vital. But the long-term U.S. diplomatic posture in Yemen is unclear. The fact that al Qaeda is a common enemy of Washington and the Houthis raises the intriguing suggestion of possible cooperation. But any tie up would likely be tacit and covert, and Washington would have trouble publicly recognizing any Houthi regime. Mohammed Albasha, a spokesman for the Yemeni embassy in Washington said, ""Americans should care about the Houthis."" ""We need to find out a way for the Houthis and the government to co-exist ... they are now a fact of life,"" he told CNN. Charles Schmitz, an expert on Yemen and professor at Towson University, said the fallout from the apparent coup against Hadi was a mixed bag for the United States. ""The Houthi are virulently anti-al Qaeda. They have gone after al Qaeda like no one has before. There is a certain coincidence of interest with the U.S. with the Houthis against al Qaeda,"" he said. ""The Houthi have done nothing to even slightly irritate the Americans. they have been very careful not to do anything like that. The Americans are very much leaving the door open."" Kamran Bokhari, an adviser on Middle Eastern and South Asian Affairs for Stratfor, a global intelligence and advisory firm, said that the Houthi movement could not be ignored. ""It is not clear to me to what extent Washington has relations with the Houthi movement. But now effectively the Houthis are kingmakers. While they do not dominate Yemen, they control the largest piece of real estate and they are the single-largest group,"" Bokhari said. The level of Iran's support for the Houthi movement, beyond rhetorical backing is in question. Tehran's intelligence resources are already stretched by the Syrian crisis and its finances have been hampered by western nuclear sanctions and the fall in the price of oil. Iran, however, has spent years spreading its influence throughout the region in its wider proxy battle with its rival Saudi Arabia, an important U.S. ally, and now sponsors or heavily influences governments or key political forces in Damascus, Beirut and Baghdad, as well as Sanaa. The complex web of tribal and sectarian forces scrambling alliances and traditional alliances in Yemen represent the region in microcosm and reflects massive challenges facing U.S. officials in search of a working policy. ""We don't have a lot of leverage in there at the moment,"" Seche said. ""There are so many forces and counter forces at play -- none of which we or anyone controls effectively,"" he said. ""There are currents and issues and long standing hostility they are going to have to work themselves to some extent.""

(Also, sometimes stalking comes in handy -- a wedding ring can come off, you know). My question is: Am I really a creeper?"" - Creeper(?) in Connecticut . Well, Creeper(?), assuming -- as we did in the last column with Creepy Crushing in Chicago -- that you are not, in fact, out of your mind, allow us to parse this out for you by way of the following examples.

You've just shaken hands with your new cubiclemate and you're settling into your computer chair when you're hit with the uncontrollable urge to enter her name into Google and hit ""Search."" Are you a creeper? Nope. In the wild, wild west of fortune-cookie writing (and all other professions), it's advantageous to know as much as you can about the people you're working with. Does your colleague have a website? Does it have information about her past gigs? Does it include some hobby that you, too, enjoy (She does George R. R. Martin fan art, too?!)? Well, then, feel free to cast around. No one is going to be creeped out that you looked at a repository of information that they themselves put online -- just do it at home (How will you feel if she walks by to invite you to lunch and sees you're six pages into her blog?), and bring it up tactfully: ""Hey! I saw your website. What was it like working with Donald Lau? He's a legend!"" On the other hand, ""I saw all those pics on Flickr where you're dressed as Lady Gaga, passed out on a couch. I love 'Born This Way,' too!"" probably won't go over too well. As the cookie would say, ""A wise man knows when to keep his mouth shut."" Your date . You're chilling at your local tiki-themed watering hole when a tall drink of grenadine saunters up to you. ""My name is Jean Jameson,"" he says with a wink. ""And I would love to take you out for a steak and my namesake sometime."" Coyly, you extract the plastic monkey from your Soft Breezes Spritzer and reply (after a lengthy chug of this, your fourth sugary, plastic-animal-laden cocktail), ""Sure thing. Whisk me away, Whiskey Boy!"" The next morning, after copious glasses of water and capsules of headache medicine, you get a text confirming the date you agreed to in your sugared-up state. Through blurry eyes, you open up the Web browser on your mobile phone and start entering Jean's liquory last name. Are you a creeper? Well, this is where things get dicey. It's totally fine to do an initial Google on someone you just met (especially somewhere like a bar or online) simply to make sure that s/he is, in fact, who they say they are. But once you've confirmed that JJ wasn't lying about being a deep sea pearl diver/living in Manhattan/his nonmarital status, you can click on out of that search box.

A recent study by the Pew Internet & American Life Project shows that 57% of adults have plunked their own names into search engines. Let's get that number up, shall we? Look, Googling yourself isn't vain -- it's smart. A story: Back in 2009, American Girl put out a doll named Rebecca Rubin -- a young Jewish girl from New York's Lower East Side. At the time, one of these humble columnists was working at a Jewish culture magazine called Heeb, and decided to blog about the doll. A quick search for ""Rebecca Rubin"" unearthed an FBI wanted poster for Rebecca ""Little Missy"" Rubin, an allegedly armed fugitive. The FBI was thrilled with the turn of events: ""Any publicity that gets the word out that our Rebecca Rubin is wanted on various charges is certainly beneficial,"" Beth Anne Steele, a spokeswoman for the FBI, told The New York Times, but the doll now carries the name of a wanted criminal. A simple Google search by an American Girl employee could have waylaid that issue. So what exactly are we babbling about? Nowadays, when anyone can and will search for you online -- you're not the only one, Creeper(?) -- your Google results are your calling card. Therefore, you should be aware of what comes up when someone enters your name into that magnifying glass-flanked box. Seriously. You should even set up a Google Alert for your name. That way, the minute an article about a head-collecting serial killer who shares your name hits the Web, you'll know why that guy you met at that bar never called you. (If the above situation does happen to befall you, we suggest buying the domain associated with your name and setting up a website -- complete with clear photos of yourself -- that explicates your profession and hobbies.

"(CNN)President Barack Obama used Tuesday night's State of the Union address to demand action on progressive priorities — but his silence on a number of key issues spoke just as loudly as his words. In the 70-minute-long address, the President gave only lip service to immigration reform. He made no remarks on protecting Social Security and Medicare — just as Republicans have hinted at a coming battle over welfare reform — and only passing reference to the crowning achievement of his first term, Obamacare, just as it's beginning to bear fruit for many Americans. And he didn't mention the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline by name, which Republicans favor as a job-creation opportunity but the White House has said Obama would veto. The speech was overall a rallying cry to progressives, a promise that he'll put up a fight for their priorities now that he's freed from the bounds of another reelection fight. It drew widespread praise from congressional Democrats, and near-uniform dismissal from Republicans. But the omissions were a reminder that, though the President's popularity is on an upswing, his legacy remains unclear and his final two years in office will still be full of challenges. The immigration reform snub was perhaps his most glaring hole. Obama only warned against ""refighting past battles on immigration when we've got a system to fix,"" and called for empathy towards immigrants. ""Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student, and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is taken from her child, and that it's possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants,"" he said during Tuesday night's speech. That's in contrast to his 2013 State of the Union speech, when he called for Congress to pass a comprehensive reform bill and declared: ""Let's get this done."" Even last year he demanded, ""let's get immigration reform done this year."" On this issue, however, Obama may be feeling less urgency because he's already done some of the work on his own, with his executive action delaying deportations for millions of immigrant families last year. But the omission underscores what a prickly subject it remains politically, one that's already the center of another spending fight on Capitol Hill that will come to a head next month. Last year, Obama used a sizable chunk of his SOTU to highlight the benefits Americans would receive from the Affordable Care act, even as the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov drew months of negative headlines and created headaches for vulnerable Democrats on the campaign trail. This year, Obama's only hint at reform was his declaration that, ""in the past year alone, about 10 million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage."" That silence comes despite the fact at least 6.4 million Americans signed up for coverage under the law during this year's enrollment period, a significant spike from last year. But Obamacare still remains unpopular, with the Real Clear Politics average of polls showing a majority of Americans still oppose it. With GOP attention focused elsewhere, the best course for the President on that issue may be to let sleeping dogs lie — especially as many Americans may face penalties when they file their taxes this year because of the law. Obama also left off a pair of progressive pet priorities that have gotten bigger play before — gun control and campaign finance reform. With the Senate in Democratic hands last year, Obama pledged to ""keep trying"" to reduce gun violence; this year, he avoided the topic altogether. And though the speech came on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the Supreme Court's Citizens' United decision, which opened the floodgates for big-money donors to influence elections, Obama didn't talk about super PACs or public financing for campaigns. Still, with historic references to transgender and lesbian individuals, and a call for tax hikes on the wealthy, most progressives had little to complain about on Tuesday night.","President Barack Obama didn't mention or comparatively downplayed a number of key issues in his State of the Union .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- For more than a week, opponents of Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak had the upper hand in Cairo, protesting with near impunity in the face of police and an army that did little to stop them. That all changed on Wednesday. The morning after Mubarak dramatically announced he would not run for re-election in September, his supporters waded into Tahrir Square by the thousands, and suddenly serious, prolonged violence reigned in central Cairo. There were immediate suspicions that the pro-Mubarak demonstrators were not simply average citizens standing up for the man who has led Egypt for three decades -- suspicions that proved at least partly founded. As battles raged between the two sides, some pro-Mubarak protesters were captured by his opponents. Some were terrified to be caught and begged for their lives, screaming that the government had paid them to come out and protest. Others turned out to be carrying what seemed to be police identification, though they were dressed in plain clothes. Shadi Hamid, a Brookings Institution analyst based in Qatar, told CNN that the use of hired muscle to break up demonstrations ""is a longtime regime strategy."" ""There are usually a line of thugs outside a protest who are waiting there,"" he said. ""They're dressed in plain clothes, and then they'll usually go and attack the protesters. Egyptians have seen this for quite some time, and that's why they were able to recognize what was going on fairly quickly."" The global rights group Amnesty International said it has documented the use of unsavory forces by Egyptian authorities to disperse political gatherings in election years. ""It looks like much of this violence is being orchestrated by the Egyptian authorities in order to force an end to the anti-government protests, restore their control and cling onto power in the face of unprecedented public demands for them to go,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, the deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International. An Interior Ministry spokesman denied on state-run television that police identification cards had been confiscated from demonstrators. He said if they had been, they were were stolen or fake. But state television reporting Wednesday did not always match CNN's own observations of what was happening in Tahrir Square. Several CNN journalists heard from pro-Mubarak demonstrators that they worked for the government. Staff from the national petrochemical company said they had been ordered to come and protest. Amnesty International researchers said witnesses told them of ""lorry loads"" of pro-Mubarak supporters leaving Wednesday morning from Mahalla, north of Cairo. ""These (pro-Mubarak) protests were organized by the government and the ruling National Democratic Party,"" analyst Kamal Zakher told CNN. The government mustered government workers and lawmakers whose seats are threatened, he said. ""They were ordered to go out today. They are well organized and that is suspicious -- especially the use of camels and horses. These are abnormal techniques to demonstrate,"" he said, referring to the shocking charge of about 50 or 60 mounted men through Tahrir in the middle of the afternoon. And Emad Shahin, a Mideast analyst at the University of Notre Dame, said ""reliable contacts in Egypt"" told him the counter-protesters were organized ""by Mubarak himself,"" with the aid of businessmen who support him. ""The whole objective is actually to give the impression that there is still support for Mubarak and to force the demonstrators out of Tahrir Square,"" Shahin said. He said the embattled president ""is presenting a very difficult choice before the Egyptian people -- either liberty or security -- and he is hoping that they will choose security at the expense of liberty."" In Washington, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs expressed concerns about the outbreak of violence. ""The president and this administration strongly condemn the outrageous and deplorable violence that's taking place on the streets of Cairo,"" Gibbs said. ""Obviously, if any of the violence is instigated by the government, it should stop immediately,"" Gibbs added. State television called the pro-Mubarak demonstrators tourism workers. At least some Egyptians working in the tourism industry are known to be genuinely upset at the anti-Mubarak demonstrators, accusing them of hurting their business by bringing instability. Zakher also said it was suspicious that security forces did not intervene to break up the violence. ""There were no police or military to separate the two crowds at the beginning and that's also suspicious enough to implicate the security agencies,"" Zakher said. Journalist and protestor Reham Saeed told CNN she saw men with police uniforms go into hotels on the way to Tahrir Square and then come out wearing civilian clothes, joining the pro-Mubarak protesters. She called that an act of ""betrayal."" State TV interviewed several people at the demonstration who said they backed the president because he had provided stability and independence. ""For 30 years, we lived in peace. President Mubarak kept us safe and secure for 30 years instead of being a country that takes orders from external forces just like (U.S. President Barack) Obama now wants,"" Iman Abu Futuh, a pro-Mubarak demonstrator, said on Nile TV. ""They want us to be another Iraq and this will not happen."" Another man said, ""I didn't cry when my father died. I cried when Mubarak spoke yesterday. I grew up watching him, seeing him, having him as my leader and the great president of this nation."" And a female demonstrator said: ""Mubarak is our father. No one can insult and ridicule their elders. If we do that, we belittle ourselves. This is how we destroy our country."" CNN's Amir Ahmed, Frederik Pleitgen, Saad Abedine and Journalist Ian Lee in Cairo contributed to this report.","Some state workers told CNN they had been ordered to protest .

"(CNN)One small crowdfunding investment online, one giant leap for South Africa? At least that's the intention behind the Africa2Moon Mission which aims to muster enough money through internet donations to send a probe to the lunar surface within a decade. The project has been proposed by the Foundation for Space Development South Africa, a non-profit based in Cape Town that seeks to increase awareness around space education and research. By reaching for the stars (or moon, in this case), the idea is to energize the youth of South Africa and beyond and to boldly take the continent where its never gone before. ""We aim to inspire, to educate and then once the mission has started up, to do research and science,"" the organization's chief executive, Jonathan Weltman, told CNN. The mission's website proudly states that the probe could even be programmed to beam pictures of the experiments it undertakes to classrooms all across Africa. Online campaign . But how will these ambitious plans be turned into reality and how likely are they to succeed? Weltman concedes that most people still regard an African nation going to the moon as a remote prospect. However, Afirca2Moon has the backing of a number of South African universities and the South African Space Association among others. Funds have been rolling in via an online donation page over the last month and the target is to reach $150,000 by the end of January to ensure the first stage goes ahead. As of publication, the mission has raised $21,600. If succesful, this initial cash will be used to develop a full lunar program as well as undertake an associated feasibility study. Outreach and public participation events to garner publicity and create engagement will also be arranged. Beyond this stage, suggestions from the scientific community around the world will be considered as to what experiments the probe should be designed to carry out. For example, should it orbit the moon or should it take the shape of a vehicle that can land on the surface and take samples? ""Our research must fit in with the rest of the world in terms of making a contribution of getting a better understanding of the moon and the needs that the global community has,"" Weltman said. Educational prospects . While the ultimate goal is to follow the likes of the U.S., the USSR, India and China in getting up close to the lunar landscape, it's the journey to that point that most interests Weltman and the FSDSA given their focus on education. Studies have shown that countries like South Africa lag behind those in Europe and Asia in terms of the number of higher education graduates and PhD students they produce. According to an article penned by Weltman on the Africa2Moon website, meanwhile, one in nine African graduates also leaves the continent after completing their studies. This has a damaging long-term impact on the continent's development and economic prospects. But an eye-catching mission to the moon could help reverse these trends, Weltman believes. ""The benefits won't only come in a decades time when the data starts to come through,"" he said. ""If we can get somebody into science, if we can get somebody to ask how are they going to get to the moon and somehow get them interested in any of the sciences and engineering, that's our job done."" The great African space race . A number of African nations have invested in space programs in recent years. South Africa, Nigeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt have all launched satellites to aid the likes of communications technology, navigation technology, agriculture, disaster management and mining. The likes of Ghana, Uganda, Angola, Ethiopia and Kenya have also voiced their commitment to follow suit with space programs of their own. On top of this, the Square Kilometer Array project in South Africa's Karoo desert will be the largest and most powerful radio telescope on earth when it comes online. Construction on SKA -- which some have compared to CERN's Large Hadron Collider -- is set to begin in 2018. In a December interview with CNN, Harvard University professor and co-chair of the African Union's High-Level Panel on Science, Technology and Innovation, Calestous Juma, told CNN that such projects were vital to creating valuable and highly skilled workforces on the continent. Others, however, have asked whether space programs or complex science projects are where African countries should be placing their focus given the many other problems facing the continent. This is not a point of view Weltman has much sympathy for. Removing the plaster . ""There's no denying there's poverty,"" he said. ""There's Ebola in western Africa, there's religious unrest, there are a lot of trials and tribulations facing our continent and they do need to be dealt with."" ""But if we pool everything into aid, it's just a plaster or a band aid that doesn't fix the problem."" Instead, Weltman suggests a more ambitious and joined up strategy that includes space ambitions will prove more fruitful in the long term. ""We have to have education. Education leads to opportunity and opportunity will lead to economic empowerment,"" he explained. ""Beyond education you have to have skill retention. Its no good creating an educated group who then migrate to better shores. Then you lose that skillset and you lose those future leaders because you're not providing for them."" ""If we don't do that what chance do we ever have of standing shoulder to shoulder so that one day people saying 'Africa goes to Mars' is as normal as saying 'America goes to Mars,' he said.

"At the former headquarters of the East German secret police, cheerful American and British tourists scan maps and chatter as they file into the blocky concrete building once known as ""the House of One Thousand Eyes."" In its heyday, the Ministry of State Security, or Stasi, was the all-powerful shadow government of the communist German Democratic Republic (GDR). Behind a grim concrete screen molded into eye-shaped portholes, true believer Erich Mielke created the world's first surveillance state -- operating a network of agents and informers so vast it encompassed every school, factory, apartment block and bar in the country, according to Anna Funder, the author of ""Stasiland: Stories from Behind the Berlin Wall."" Mielke's grim bureaucracy wasn't the only game in town, I discovered on a do-it-yourself tour of ""the spy's Berlin."" Before the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, the unique position of West Berlin -- a walled outpost of freedom behind the Iron Curtain -- made the divided city the focus of Western and Soviet ""tradecraft"" for nearly 50 years, says Bernd Kostka, author of ""Berlin: Capital of Spies."" ""Only here in Berlin were the main protagonists of the Cold War living door to door,"" Kostka says. Along with the House of One Thousand Eyes, now home to the Stasi Museum (Ruschestrasse 103, Haus 1, Berlin; +49 30 553 68 54), various sites around the city commemorate the capital's clandestine history -- even as revelations that the U.S. National Security Agency was until recently tapping Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone prove that the tradition lives on. iReport: Tell us your favorite thing about Berlin . Noir intrigue . There's a wealth of experiences here for the espionage buff. On a rainy night at Checkpoint Charlie (Friedrichstrasse 43-45, Kreuzberg, Berlin), the most famous crossing point between East and West Berlin, it's just possible to imagine the noir intrigue of John Le Carre's ""The Spy who Came in from the Cold"" -- however much a tourist destination it becomes on a sunny afternoon. Watching the incomparable movie version starring Richard Burton helps. Featured in that masterpiece as well as countless other films, the crossing's main historical importance stems from the infamous ""Checkpoint Charlie standoff,"" when a 1961 confrontation between Soviet and American tanks nearly sparked World War III. Outside the Friedrichstrasse S-Bahnhof (Reichstagufer 17, Berlin-Mitte; +49 30 46777790) -- another Le Carre locale -- the Tranenpalast, or Palace of Tears, captures the atmosphere of paranoia more vividly. Named for the tearful goodbyes of separated families, this station was once the official crossing point for West Germans visiting relatives in the GDR. (Le Carre's ""Sasha"" recounts the story of a surrender to border guards here in ""Absolute Friends."") Along with smuggled contraband and artifacts from ""behind the Wall,"" the museum showcases an incredible exhibition of video interviews and documentary footage -- as well as the original signs and apparatus for the checkpoint searches and interviews. On the outskirts of town, the American side of the spy story is on display at the Allied Museum (Clayallee 135, Berlin; +49 30 8181990) in Zehlendorf -- which houses seven meters of a 420-meter-long Allied forces spy tunnel dug under the Wall to tap East German telephone lines in 1953. (A story fictionalized in Ian McEwan's ""The Innocent"" and the later movie starring Anthony Hopkins.) One of the most celebrated missions of the early Cold War, the tunnel was the largest and most expensive intelligence operation in Europe in the 1950s. But it's hard to say who benefited from it most, says ""Capital of Spies"" author Kostka. Though the tunnel allowed the Allies to intercept some 400,000 Soviet army telephone calls and countless telegraph messages before it was discovered in 1956, the Russians knew about it from the beginning, Kostka explains. They kept that knowledge hidden from Berlin to protect their own man in the British government, MI6 case officer and double agent George Blake. The eastern portion of the tunnel, long thought to be lost, was discovered by a man chopping wood in 2012. 'Bridge of spies' Near the tunnel's original location, the Glienicke Brucke, or Bridge of Spies, (Bundestrasse 1, Berlin) between Wannsee in the West and Potsdam in the East, is perhaps the most famous espionage landmark in the city. The border crossing designated for the exchange of captured spies, it was here that a KGB agent caught spying for the Russians in New York was traded for downed U-2 spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers. It's an attractive spot on the Havel River, but there's little more than a plaque to mark its significance, so it's best viewed today as a quick stop on a larger tour of Potsdam or other nearby sites. At the Teufelsberg, or Devil's Mountain, a similar listening post -- this one an abandoned U.S. radar station and observation tower -- has been taken over by Berlin's ubiquitous graffiti artists. A silent tour around the strange, white radomes -- weatherproof microwave antennae cases reminiscent of Disney's Epcot Center -- gives an eerie feeling in the age of the recent NSA disclosures from Edward Snowden. Once a secretive military enclave, the full history of the complex won't be revealed until documents are declassified in 2022, but it's estimated more than 1,000 spies worked here throughout the Cold War, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, as part of a surveillance network known as ECHELON. For me, though, nothing captures the Cold War spy's world better than the hot and stuffy Stasi Museum, where the GDR spymaster's suite of offices and conference rooms have been preserved unchanged. In these spartan chambers, banks of Bakelite telephones, steel desks and chunky typewriters evoke what renowned Nazi trial chronicler Hannah Arendt might have called ""the bureaucracy of evil,"" had she written about East Germany rather than the Third Reich. As the milky light reflects off the wood paneling, a shudder runs down my spine.","Berlin's past as an espionage hotspot has left the city with numerous spying-linked attractions .

"Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton did not have 65 Secret Service agents protecting her in Canada on Wednesday, a Secret Service source told CNN, despite a report from a Canadian radio station to the contrary. And the head of TCU Place, the venue for Clinton's event, now says the comment that came from a venue employee was incorrect. News Talk 980 CJME, a local radio station in Saskatoon, reported on Wednesday night that a security supervisor from the venue hosting Clinton said ""approximately 65 agents"" were in house to protect the former first lady. Poll: Clinton clobbers potential GOP foes . The news ballooned on Thursday morning when the conservative Weekly Standard cited the radio station in a post, the influential Drudge Report linked to the story and the anti-Clinton super PAC America Rising blasted an email to reporters about Clinton's ""army of Secret Service agents, paid for at taxpayer expense."" All of this, however, was incorrect, says a source at the Secret Service. ""Although it's our policy not to discuss specific security measures, in this instance we can say this number is grossly inaccurate and exaggerated,"" the source said. Bob Korol, the CEO of TCU Place, told CNN on Friday morning that the statement that 65 agents were protecting Clinton was a ""miscomment"" by the security supervisor. ""It was a miscomment,"" said Korol, who said the security supervisor was not the director of security and would not have been privy to those numbers. ""I don't know exactly how many it was,"" Korol said. ""But I don't think it was 65."" A Clinton spokesman declined to comment and referred CNN to the Secret Service. Because Clinton is a former first lady and secretary of state, she regularly travels with a cadre of agents who protect her wherever she goes. When Clinton is traveling for speaking engagements and events, her personal protection is regularly increased by local agents.","A security supervisor said ""approximately 65 agents"" traveled to Canada with Hillary Clinton .

"(CNN)It took six grueling years. But finally, Barack Obama took the chance to look the American people in the eye and declare job done. In his State of the Union address Tuesday night  -- more a lofty campaign style rallying call than a traditional plodding policy lecture -- Obama declared he had delivered on what voters first elected him to do:  conquering a ""vicious"" economic crisis and ending ground wars in the Middle East. ""Tonight, we turn the page,"" the president said in his address to a joint session of Congress, trying to make an emphatic break with a turbulent 15-year period when twin shocks from terrorism and financial meltdowns rocked the nation. ""The shadow of crisis has passed,"" he said. ""The state of the union is strong."" For the first time in a State of the Union address it sounded like he meant it. The loose and combative Obama who Americans saw on Tuesday night was not the graying, crisis-stifled president who last year seemed weary of his job and failed to mount an effective defense of Democrats as the party lost the Senate in November. There was no sign of contrition, or even an indication he felt at all bloodied by the disastrous mid-terms, in which Democrats lost control of the Senate. Instead, riding a tide of unexpected momentum which has even surprised White House aides, Obama shoved back in the game by wielding executive powers on issues like Cuba and immigration to prove he is still a political force in Washington. ""I have no more campaigns to run,"" he said drawing Republican applause, before silencing his foes with a kicker that encapsulates his attitude to an opposition party with which he has feuded for his entire presidency. ""I know -- because I won them both."" ""Middle class economics"" He said the ""verdict is clear"" that his brand of ""middle class economics"" works, and promised to wield his veto against any GOP attempt to roll back reforms on health care and the financial industry. In exactly two years, Obama will be out of the White House. But he could not resist offering a pointer for a Democrat who wants to succeed him -- presumably Hillary Clinton, pushing new doctrines of ""middle class economics"" and ""smarter"" Middle East policy which would keep ISIS at bay and spare American soldiers from foreign quagmires. Obama's claim of a new era of prosperity at home and security abroad angered Republicans. Potential candidates blast tax proposals . Mitt Romney, an old Obama foe mulling another shot at the White House accused the president of a lack of leadership. ""More intent on winning elections than on winning progress, he ignores the fact that the country has elected a Congress that favors smaller government and lower taxes,"" Romney said on Facebook. With fear of homegrown jihadists stalking the West, from Paris to Ottawa and Australia to Belgium, Obama critics say he was in denial over a failing strategy to take on global terrorism. Obama did not mention al-Qaeda at all. And he only referred to the attacks on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in passing. ""We stand united with people around the world who have been targeted by terrorists -- from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris,"" Obama said, but gave no indication that the sudden eruption of home grown jihadism would change his national security strategy. Obama cuts loose during speech . ""Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we're partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America,"" he said. Focus on economy, not terror . Potential GOP presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio warned that ""saying wars are over isn't enough to keep us safe."" And even as he declared one era of foreign wars over, the president asked Congress to give him backing to wage another -- albeit the arms length clash using mainly air power  -- against ISIS. Obama's aides said the president saw his address not as a chance to unveil the usual laundry list of programs -- but to tell a ""new story"" about a presidency which has unfolded in times of crisis at home and abroad. GOP skeptical of Obama's call for unity . His appearance, six years on from the cold January day in 2009 when he took the oath of office, coincided with a cluster of political turning points. For the first time in a State of the Union address Tuesday, Obama, the most liberal president since Lyndon Johnson, stood up in the House of Representatives and stared out at the members of two chambers which are now both controlled by Republicans. It was a reminder that despite two crushing presidential victories, Obama's two terms also included two bitter mid-term rebukes from voters. Economic milestones . But with unemployment down to 5.6 percent, with the economy churning out several hundred thousand jobs a month, and with growth accelerating, Obama may have reached a political milestone. For years, the president has got little credit for restoring an economy that was shedding 700,000 jobs a month when he took office. That's partly because the results of the rebound have been so uneven. While the stock market has soared, many in the Middle Class have been left behind. Wages are stagnant and many of the new jobs created pay less and have fewer benefits than the ones that are gone. Still, there is a sense now that the benefits of the recovery are spreading, and low gas prices are restoring a half forgotten sense of well being for many Americans. ""With a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry and booming energy production -- we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth,"" Obama said. ""It's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years, and for decades to come."" A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Tuesday showed that 45 percent of Americans were now very or somewhat satisfied with the US economy, and the trend is rising. The percentage of those who believe America is in decline has dropped to its lowest level since the crisis. The country now seems 50-50 split on that issue. ""This is a president who for whatever reason, woke up and saw the economic numbers and saw he had a pretty strong hand, and he is going to start playing some cards right now,"" said John Geer, a professor who specializes in the presidency at Vanderbilt University . Obama's own political fortunes are rising as a result. A Washington Post poll has him at 50 percent, his highest rating for nearly two years. Other surveys confirm the rebound, but place Obama in the high 40s -- still heady territory for a president shellacked in the mid-term elections. Confronting new threats . The sense that Obama is confronting an important political moment also played out as he addressed foreign policy. After years of telling Americans that the tide of war is receding, Obama is being forced to confront an alarming new manifestation of violent jihadism in Europe, which many officials fear could soon make its way to the streets of the United States. American warplanes are in the skies over Iraq again, following the sudden rise of ISIS. Up to 3,000 troops have been sent back to the country just years after Obama told Americans the war was over. Splintering states in the Middle East including Syria and Yemen are offering new safe havens for terror groups with the United States in their sights. Obama made the case for a focused but ""smarter"" campaign against ISIS, but took time to rebut criticisms by Republicans like John McCain and Lindsey Graham who believe he is too slow to use force abroad. ""When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads, when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military -- then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts,"" Obama said. The back end of a presidency . The speech also marked a moment of valediction. Barring some great national political crisis, Tuesday's appearance may have been the last time when Obama took the stage as America's most important voice for liberalism. When Clinton announces what is seen as her almost certain presidential campaign later this year, she will likely become the go-to voice for progressives on all domestic issues. And by the time of the State of the Union address next year, the presidential primary season will be in full swing -- drawing media attention from the lame duck in the White House. Robert Lehrman, chief speechwriter for former vice president Al Gore, said that Obama had long term political goals in mind as he knew almost nothing he proposed would get passed. ""But he is laying the groundwork for whoever it is in 2016 to run against a Republican,"" said Lehrman, now a professor at American University. Apparently sensing his time is short, Obama mounted an extraordinary defense of his own political skills, even referring to the speech in Boston he made as an unknown senatorial candidate at the Democratic National Convention in 2004. ""Over the past six years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasn't delivered on this vision,"" Obama said arguing that many people thought he was naive. ""I know how tempting such cynicism may be. But I still think the cynics are wrong,"" Obama said, in a plea for a ""better politics"" that will likely remain unfulfilled, in one of the biggest disappointments of his presidency.","Obama finally declares victory over economic recovery .

"The sheer amount and range of cultural activities available at any given time in Berlin is astonishing. Even with a good guidebook it's almost impossible to scratch the surface of its constantly evolving scene. Here are 10 destinations that'll help newcomers get up to speed with what's happening in a city that refuses to stand still. Klunkerkranich . Walking past Neukolln Arcaden -- a shopping center located in southeast Berlin -- you'd never suspect that a super cool 2,500 square-meter rooftop bar and garden sits atop the lackluster gray building. Formerly a concrete parking deck, Klunkerkranich has been revamped into a vibrant space for live music, film screenings and readings. In the summer, it's the perfect spot to have a drink, be entertained by local artists and watch the sun set over the city. It's not easy to find though. From U-Bahn station Rathaus Neukolln, enter through the Postbank/Bibliothek entrance and take the elevator to the 5th floor. Exit and walk towards the parking garage ramp to the 6th floor.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)After days of turmoil and talks of a coup in Yemen, the government and Houthi rebels reached a tentative deal Wednesday. The rebels have agreed to release the President's chief of staff and withdraw their militias from key government institutions if officials take a significant step: rewriting parts of the country's constitution, according to a Yemeni official with access to a draft text of the peace deal. Under the terms of the agreement, the government will accept changes in the draft of the new constitution that would grant the Houthis more political power. Word of the deal still leaves many questions unanswered: What could the reshaped constitution look like? How much power will the rebels get? And how much control will President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi have? Houthi rebels -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- abducted the President's chief of staff over the weekend, then took over the presidential palace in Sanaa on Tuesday. One government minister called it ""the completion of a coup,"" but rebels said they had not asked the president to step down. The chaos in Yemen is cause for concern far beyond the country's borders. For the United States and its allies, Yemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemen-based group linked to attacks such as the recent slaughter at French magazine Charlie Hebdo. AQAP also tried to blow up a plane landing in Detroit in 2009. ISIS is also recruiting in Yemen to expand its ranks​ . And questions over who's in charge over the past few days have sparked concerns that a power vacuum could help terrorist groups get a stronger foothold. But the deal inked Wednesday could signal a return to stability, said Mohammed Albasha, a spokesman for the Yemeni Embassy in Washington. ""The situation is fluid. It's critical. The government was paralyzed. Parts of the government (were) dysfunctional, but we did not reach the point of no return,"" he told CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""Things are difficult, but there are things that are moving forward."" Several of the constitutional changes sought by the Houthis would emphasize the characteristics of Yemen as a federal state and push for more inclusion of diverse groups. The Houthis call for marginalized political groups to have the right to partnerships in state institutions and fair representation, according to the text of the tentative agreement. In return for these government concessions, the rebels basically agree to withdraw their fighters from the capital. The rebels control or have blockaded several government installations: the presidential palace, the presidential residence, the Prime Minister's residence and a military installation where missiles are housed. Under the agreement, the Houthis would withdraw from all of these sites. The rebels would cooperate with the government so that the President and state institutions can return to their duties and would urge all state employees to return to their jobs. A Houthi official said the rebels will abide by the deal if the President follows a timeline specified in the negotiations. ""This deal draws the road map for the political process going forward with the participation of all factions in Yemen. In the past, timelines were not respected, who hope this time will be different,"" a member of the Houthi Political council said. This isn't the first time the rebels and the government have hammered out an agreement. Houthis swept into the capital last year, sparking battles that left more than 300 dead in a month. In September, they signed a ceasefire deal with the government, and Houthis have since installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions. Like them or not, Albasha said, the Houthis aren't going anywhere and are part ""of the Yemeni political structure."" ""They are now a fact of life. They are now a dominant force in many of the northern provinces,"" he said. ""We're going to have to coexist and live with them."" For days, the answers to questions about who's in charge of the country have varied, depending on who you ask. Even as rebel militiamen stepped up their presence outside the presidential palace, a Yemeni official told CNN the President does not consider himself a captive. The official said the Houthis were assisting Hadi's security detail in their protection mission because part of the detail had ""run away yesterday because of the fighting."" A senior leader of the Houthi resistance movement, Abdullah Shabaan, gave a similar account. He told CNN that the ""President's personal security left him, which forced us to gather hundreds of fighters from our security to ensure he is safe."" Summarizing the actual balance of power, the official said the Houthis' demands were clear and ""nobody can hide that they are the dominant force, but they still recognize government power."" Besides the confusion about who is at the helm in Yemen, the rebels seized military installations it says it will return under the agreement. Two Houthi field commanders told CNN that rebels had seized control of a massive weapons depot belonging to the government brigade that provides presidential personal security. The Houthis had control of 280 T-80 Russian-made tanks and other heavy artillery, the field commanders said. While most of the security forces reportedly fled after a light clash with militants, the Houthis said they captured at least 12 special forces soldiers. On Wednesday, Houthi rebels surrounded a Yemeni missile brigade in Attan, a suburb east of Sanaa. The installation is not under control of the rebels, but they have it surrounded, the field commanders and two government officials said. The Houthis said their objective is not to take over the missile brigade but to keep missiles from being moved elsewhere. Seven things to know about Yemen .

But a U.S. military official said that in the course of investigating the death of a civilian, the Navy received information alleging that Nettleton was engaged in an inappropriate relationship with the civilian's wife. According to the Miami Herald, Christopher Tur was found dead in the waters off Guantanamo Bay on January 11. He had been a worker at the base commissary. Having an affair violates military law -- the Uniform Code of Military Justice -- and could  in itself constitute grounds for Nettleton's reassignment. There are initial indications that Tur's death was a suicide, but no cause of death has yet been determined, according to one official with knowledge of the situation. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was asked about the story by reporters at the Pentagon on Thursday. He confirmed that Nettleton was no longer in command, but had no further comment. ""Well, the base commander has been relieved,"" said Hagel. ""It is now in the purview of appropriate authorities.  So, I won't have anything to say specifically about that, which would be inappropriate. But the commander has been relieved and that is right."" The Naval commander at Guantanamo Bay does not oversee the detention facility that President Barack Obama has vowed to close. Nettleton has been in charge since June 2012. The decision to relieve him of his duties was made by Rear Adm. Mary M. Jackson, commander of Navy Region Southeast, the military said in a statement.","Capt. John R. Nettleton has been reassigned to Florida .

"(CNN)Even after decades of battling one of the world's biggest killers, the treatment of cancer is still an inexact science. Successful methods such as chemotherapy work by killing the cancer cells, but they also destroy healthy tissue. Health practitioners have been searching for a magic bullet that goes straight to the source of the cancer -- and everything from monoclonal antibodies, which carry cancer drugs direct to cancer cells, to straight surgery to cut out tumors have been used with varying degrees of success. In Belgium, engineer and nuclear physicist Yves Jongen is pioneering a new therapy that targets cancers with proton radiation; a therapy that offers precision and minimal side effects. ""I started to designing equipment (for) proton therapy of cancer -- that was a radically new idea,"" Jongen told CNN. Encased in a two-metre thick concrete bunker that serves as a radiation shield, one of Jongen's cyclotron machines produces proton beams to treat cancer patients. ""In this space we accelerate the protons and we give them a higher and higher velocity until they reach two thirds of the speed of light -- that's 200,000 km per second and this acceleration takes place in the shape of a spiral,"" he said. ""That's needed if you want to be able to penetrate one foot into the body of a patient."" Once the proton beam has been generated, it's piped into a treatment room where patients receive a powerful dose of targeted radiation that kills only those cancerous cells. ""It does a lot less collateral damage to the patient,"" Jongen said. ""That's the great thing about proton therapy."" While proton therapy is a giant step forward, it's not yet  the magic bullet that clinicians are looking for. So far, it is not effective against all types of cancer. ""There are a number of cancers which are not localized,"" he said. ""If you look at leukemia, which is cancer of the blood cells, there is nowhere to shoot -- it's all through the body."" The other drawback is that the cyclotron is not cheap. Each system -- and the bunker needed to house it -- doesn't leave much change from $125 million. Currently there are just 43 operational particle therapy facilities worldwide, with a total of 121 treatment rooms. As the fame of the process has started to spread, some people have been taking desperate measures to get treatment. One British couple last year even sparked an international manhunt after they removed their son from hospital without doctors' permission to get to a proton center in Prague in the Czech Republic. Proton treatment is limited on Britain's National Health Service. Just one center in the north of the country offers proton therapy for certain types of eye tumors. Other centers, however, are currently in development. While the proton therapy market is expected to more than double by 2018, with an estimated 300 proton therapy rooms, Jongen's Brussels-based company IBA is working on a smaller and cheaper model they hope will make proton therapy more accessible. ""It would be much less expensive making it more possible for a hospital to afford it -- a smaller system can already treat a relatively large number of patients per year."" At the moment, fewer than 1% of cancer patients are treated with proton therapy, but Jongen is hopeful that smaller and cheaper machines will be the game changer. ""I have a number of letters from parents of young kids saying if it had not been for this treatment we would have lost our kid,"" he said. ""That's something I really cherish. When I feel a bit depressed, for whatever reason, I go back to those letters and they are very exciting."" Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: . Digital nose on a chip can sniff out cancer .

"Golden, Colorado (CNN)A Colorado resident who pleaded guilty to wanting to join ISIS jihad has adopted a new Muslim first name and prepared a new hairstyle for her sentencing Friday. Shannon Maureen Conley, 19, now prefers to go by Amatullah, she told CNN during a visit to her jailhouse the day before her sentencing. The name means female ""servant of Allah,"" she said. Conley initially took the name Halima after converting to Islam. She will become one of the first Americans sentenced for conspiracy to support ISIS. Conley attracted national attention last year after authorities arrested her at Denver International Airport. Investigators said she told them she was going to Turkey to await word from an ISIS member in Syria -- a man she met on the Internet and planned to marry. According to court documents, she intended to become a nurse in an ISIS camp. She is a Colorado certified nurse's aide. Here are three key questions about her case: . Conley seemed friendly and nervous Thursday, sometimes hesitant to say anything that would upset her attorney, who wasn't present. She was happy to talk about less-sensitive matters such as her new coiffure: a tight braid to her dark brown hair, arranged in four or five rows. She wasn't wearing a Muslim headscarf. ""Oh, this is for tomorrow,"" Conley said about her new hairstyle for the sentencing in federal court. She declined to go into detail, however, about her pending punishment, in which she is facing a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. She pleaded guilty last year to conspiring to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist group. ""I'm in a vulnerable place right now, and it would be stupid of me to talk to you when I'm vulnerable,"" she told CNN during a video conference visit in the Jefferson County Detention Facility in Golden, which didn't allow any on-camera taping. She didn't want to talk about her crime. ""No comment,"" she said. ""Didn't you learn your lesson last time?"" That was a reference to CNN's prior jailhouse visit, in which Conley said her attorney had advised her against talking to the media about her case. But Conley did acknowledge a measure of transformation since her arrest and jailing pending her sentence. That's why she changed her name, she said. ""I'm a different person than when I came in,"" she explained. Opinion: When Americans leave for jihad . Her mother, AnaMaria, was blunt. ""She was clueless. She's just a teenager, young, with a big mouth,"" the mother told CNN last year. ""I think another time, another place, she would just be another kid with a big mouth."" ISIS is extremely savvy with its Internet propaganda, and her daughter was a victim of the jihadist group, AnaMaria Conley said. The mother worries about other impressionable young Americans. ""I hope that justice rather than fear will prevail,"" the mother said. She and her husband, John, were aware of their daughter's conversion to Islam but didn't know about her interest in extreme Islam or jihad. John Conley reportedly caught his daughter talking to her ""suitor,"" a 32-year-old Tunisian man, on Skype. The couple asked for the father's blessing, but he said no. On April 1, the father called the FBI to report that he had found her ticket for an April 8 flight to Turkey on his desk. Opinion: Rise of the female jihadists . The FBI and Joint Terrorism Task Force were tipped off to Conley's suspicious activity in November 2013, when the pastor and security director of Faith Bible Chapel told local police that Conley was wandering around campus and taking notes, court papers said. The church's main campus in Arvada was the scene of a gunman's fatal shooting in 2007. When church staff confronted Conley about her notes, she allegedly told them: ""Why is the church worried about a terrorist attack?"" and that terrorists are ""... not allowed to kill aging adults and little children,"" according to court papers. Church officials asked her not to return. In an interview with the FBI the following month, she said she joined the U.S. Army Explorers to receive military training and intended to use the firearm skills to go overseas to wage jihad, court papers said. Over five months, authorities interviewed her seven times. Conley told them that ""jihad must be waged to protect Muslim nations,"" court papers said. She preferred to wage jihad overseas, to be with jihad fighters. Conley told investigators she ""would be defending Muslims on the Muslim homeland against people who are trying to kill them,"" according to court documents. Conley told her parents that her knowledge of Islam was based solely on research she had conducted on the Internet. Four days before Conley's April 8 flight, federal investigators again questioned her about whether she would engage in actual combat on the ISIS battlefield. ""If it was absolutely necessary, then yes. I wouldn't like it ... but I would do it,"" she told authorities, according to court papers. But, she added about her ISIS suitor in Syria: ""He's the man, he should be doing the fighting."" Opinion: What lures Americans to Syria fight? CNN's Ana Cabrera and Sara Weisfeldt reported from Colorado. Michael Martinez wrote and reported from Los Angeles.","Shannon Conley, 19, tells CNN at her jailhouse that she calls herself Amatullah .

"(CNN)Iran's Supreme Leader has written a letter in English asking Western youths not to judge Islam based on the Charlie Hebdo terror attacks, in a message published on the cleric's website and Twitter account. In the post, titled ""To the Youth in Europe and North America,"" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei calls on young people to seek out their own understanding of Islam, and he criticizes the media's portrayal of Muslims following the massacre of 16 people at the French satirical magazine and at a kosher supermarket in Paris this month. ""The recent events in France and similar ones in some other Western countries have convinced me to directly talk to you about them,"" Khamenei's letter reads. ""I am addressing you, [the youth], not because I overlook your parents, rather it is because the future of your nations and countries will be in your hands; and also I find that the sense of quest for truth is more vigorous and attentive in your hearts."" The Paris attacks, which have provoked a wave of anti-Islam protests in the West, were retribution for Charlie Hebdo's lampooning of Islam over the years. The magazine's first issue after the attack, which features a caricature of the Prophet Mohammed on its cover, has sparked demonstrations across the Muslim world. But the leader of Iran, where chants of ""Death to America"" have been a familiar refrain at Friday prayers and parliamentary sessions since the Islamic republic's founding in 1979, strikes a more conciliatory tone in his message to young people in the West. ""I don't insist that you accept my reading or any other reading of Islam,"" his letter reads. ""What I want to say is: Don't allow this dynamic and effective reality in today's world to be introduced to you through resentments and prejudices. Don't allow them to hypocritically introduce their own recruited terrorists as representatives of Islam."" Khamenei also riffs on Western history, explaining that the United States and Europe have a long tradition of oppressing people of ""color and non-Christians."" He describes his admiration for chastened Western historians who are, in his words, ""deeply ashamed of the bloodsheds wrought in the name of religion between the Catholics and Protestants or in the name of nationality and ethnicity during the First and Second World Wars."" Khamenei calls on readers to ignore media portrayals of Islam: ""Receive knowledge of Islam from its primary and original sources. Gain information about Islam through the Qur'an and the life of its great Prophet,"" he writes. ""Why does the power structure in the world want Islamic thought to be marginalized and remain latent?"" Khamenei asks readers to ask themselves, then: ""I would like you not to allow the derogatory and offensive image-buildings to create an emotional gulf between you and the reality."" The Supreme Leader finishes with a hopeful message that ""future generations would write the history of this current interaction between Islam and the West with a clearer conscience and lesser resentment."" Khamenei's letter comes at a time of thawing relations between Iran and the U.S., as the two longtime adversaries try to hammer out a deal on the future of Iran's nuclear program. Barack Obama even sent a letter to Khamenei in October, pointing out that they share a common enemy in ISIS, the Sunni Islamist terror group that has seized huge chunks of Syria and Iraq. But diplomatic progress has not stopped the Ayatollah from bashing the West on social media in recent months. He called the U.S. the ""enemy"" on Twitter two weeks ago in a tweet about nuclear talks, and in August he blasted the treatment of African-Americans in a tweet about the protests after the police killing of an unarmed black teen in Ferguson, Missouri. And in November, Khamenei tweeted a nine-point explanation of why Israel should be ""annihilated"" -- a comment that infuriated Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who urged Western powers to pull out of nuclear negotiations with Iran. Khamenei's letter in full can be read here.","Iran's Supreme Leader asks Western youths to study Islam before making judgments .

"San Diego (CNN)On the threshold of the 2016 election, the GOP is in a terrible fix over immigration. They've done such an effective job of alienating Hispanics over the years with their overall approach to immigration. Fences need to be mended. At least that's the views of Republicans who understand changing demographics and realize the folly of antagonizing a population that produces more than 2 million potential voters every four years and maintains a sizable presence in three battleground states: Nevada, Florida and Colorado. And yet, in politics, the first rule is that elected officials should always remember to take care of their base -- elements of which, for the GOP, frown on attempts by Republican politicians to engage in ""Hispandering"" by reaching out to Hispanic voters and softening their tone on immigration. It's mostly about jealously and resentment over seeing elected officials who used to woo them going off to woo somewhere else. Nonetheless, going forward, Republicans aren't sure what to do, and this indecision stems from three things. First, it is an article of faith among Republicans -- particularly those in the House of Representatives -- that the voters who turned out in November and put the GOP back in control of both houses of Congress want them to derail what the right-wing inaccurately describes as Obama's ""executive amnesty."" That's what House Republicans attempted to do recently when they used amendments to a spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security to cut off funding for the administration's plan to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation. The tactic divides Republicans and sets up a confrontation with GOP Senate colleagues, who are expected to scuttle the measure. It's also a largely symbolic effort that will, in the end, not amount to much besides giving House Republicans something to point to down the road, when they go home to their districts. They're probably counting on the fact that, while some of their constituents will be angry that Obama's executive action survived, others will give conservative lawmakers an ""A"" for effort. Second, the Republican establishment and other moderates -- both in Washington and at the state level -- are determined to win back Hispanic support and not further antagonize or alienate those voters, unless the GOP wants to turn up DOA in the next several presidential elections. Republicans don't have to turn themselves inside out, but they need to deal with immigration with more honesty, nuance and common sense. They should stop attacking immigrants because they're frustrated by the government's response to illegal immigration. And they should pick on people their own size by going after employers. Finally, they need to adopt a zero tolerance policy the next time a Republican official says something racist or nativist. Too many Republicans are cowards when it comes to acknowledging the role that ethnicity plays in the current anxiety that many Americans feel about managing immigration and securing the borders. And third, according to polls, nearly 90% of Hispanic voters support Obama's executive action and about 80% of Hispanic voters say the GOP should not interfere with it, which sets up the possibility that Hispanics will punish Republicans if they continue to try to dismantle the policy. This doesn't mean that all or even most Hispanics want open borders. It's hard to make that argument given that, at the moment, most Border Patrol agents are Hispanic. But what I hear from Hispanics is that while they're fed up with how both parties play politics with the immigration issue, they're really furious at Republicans for that party's efforts to demagogue this issue in order to scare up votes from white people. Hispanics say they want employers punished and not just the immigrants who can't defend themselves. And they tell me despite Republicans denying that race and ethnicity are factors in the debate, they don't believe for one minute that Americans would be this shook up if the majority of illegal immigrants were coming from Canada, Sweden or Great Britain instead of Mexico, El Salvador and Guatemala. So how do Republicans placate those right-wing elements of their base and undo Obama's executive action on immigration without further enraging Hispanics? It won't be easy. Payback can be brutal. And while some political parties never learn, Hispanics never forget. Republicans could stubbornly decide that they don't need Hispanic support in 2016 and beyond, and so they don't have to worry about alienating them. Or they could roll the dice and count on the assumption that -- despite what the polls say -- not all Hispanics support Obama's executive action because they oppose illegal immigration as much as other Americans. For now, Republicans seem to be going down a third road and simply ignoring the practical impact that their attempted rollback of Obama's executive action would have on the millions of illegal immigrants who -- if the GOP were successful -- would suddenly be, once again, eligible for deportation. Republicans don't want those people to be the focus of this discussion, and they'd prefer the attention to be on the validity of executive action itself. That is where they're shifting the conversation. That's a weak attempt to dodge the issue. Hispanics are closer to this issue than other Americans because more of them have first-hand contact with illegal immigrants. They know this debate isn't some abstract discussion of competing priorities. They know it's about people and detached politicians deciding who stays and who goes. That sounds like a fun game. Well, next year, Hispanics will get to play. They'll help decide which elected officials stay in office and which ones go home for good.","On the threshold of the 2016 election, the GOP is in a terrible fix over immigration .

"(CNN)Sunday, January 18, 2014 . Wow!  Sunday evening, it's 9:30 p.m., and I am beat.  Might fall asleep.  Guess I will find out how the Patriots did in the AFC playoff tomorrow (the game would have started at 11:40 p.m. local time). I arrived here in Liberia Friday evening, January 16, after a 26 hour trip (three flights with a long layover in Brussels), with my seven pieces of luggage, filled mostly  with donated drugs and supplies for ELWA Hospital, the ministry SIM runs just outside Monrovia. I've spent some time catching up with our SIM Liberia country director, Will, who just got back here from the UK about five days ago, and Dr. John, my colleague who has been anchoring the hospital medical staff throughout the Ebola crisis. Because I wasn't due to report for work until Monday, we decided to clean the apartment where I had stayed in August, as it had been unoccupied since I left. Dr. John and I suited up in gloves and gowns this afternoon to clean out the apartment, bleaching items that were valuable (like my Kindle and my digital camera, which both seem to work), disposing of the rest, washing the dishes in bleach and soap, and mopping all the surfaces with bleach. After a few more days of airing out, it will be ready to use.  It took over 4 hours in 90 degree heat. We were drenched with sweat -- no wonder I am exhausted! Later, when I tested my camera to see if it still worked after sitting in the humid, salty air for four months, I looked at the pictures I had taken back in August.  The final picture was one taken after I developed a fever: It was of a lovely pineapple upside down cake, baked by a good friend from church who didn't even realize I was sick. Her son had brought it to me after Sunday worship service, and I told him he had to just leave it on the step. Returning to the apartment, and seeing the picture of the cake, brought me right back to my last weekend there. It sharpened my recollection of my feelings -- waiting anxiously to see if my fever would break, praying earnestly and tearfully, and focusing my thoughts on God's love and care for me, whatever was to come. Seeing all my friends and colleagues, both missionaries and Liberians, has been great! It does feel like something is missing from our reunion, since we are not hugging or shaking hands in Liberia at this time. But still -- there have been wonderful smiles as people recognize me and express their thanks to God that my life was spared.  Liberians really know how to smile. Most people are visibly relieved by the improvement in conditions. The number of cases of Ebola has come down markedly -- the ELWA 2 unit associated with our hospital is now empty. There are still scattered cases in isolated pockets around the city, and in the rural areas in western Liberia. People seem optimistic but still very vigilant. They remember that there was a significant drop in cases back in May, early in the epidemic, which turned out to be just a lull followed by a huge second wave. It also sounds like more people are getting themselves to a treatment unit on time for care, so the survival rate is higher than it was at first. A dear friend told me the sad story of her neighbor who died of Ebola in November.  He was in denial the entire time, and would not admit that his symptoms might be due to Ebola.  He died and unfortunately eight others in his family also got sick and died. Many are recognizing this pattern: Those who are quicker to suspect Ebola and get tested do much better themselves, and help protect their family and community.  On the other hand, those who remain in denial, end up harming the ones they love. On the whole, Liberia has come to grips with the reality of Ebola, and I feel proud of their resilience and determination to beat this virus, with God's help.","Dr. Rick Sacra was treating patients in Liberia when he got sick with Ebola .

"New York (CNN)New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver was arrested Thursday on charges that he used his position as one of the state's most-powerful politicians to amass millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks, federal prosecutors said. Silver's remarkable fall from grace came one day after he shared the stage with Gov. Andrew Cuomo during the State of the State address in Albany. As Speaker of the Legislature's Democrat-controlled lower house, Silver held significant power over the operation of New York government, particularly over the real estate industry and health care funding. Silver, 70, was taken into custody at about 8 a.m. Thursday by FBI agents and charged with two counts of ""honest services fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, one count of extortion under color of official right and one count of conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right,""  said Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. The charges, if resulting in a conviction, carry a maximum penalty of 100 years in prison. Silver's attorneys, Joel Cohen and Steven Molo, said in a statement: ""We're disappointed that the prosecutors have chosen to proceed with these meritless criminal charges. That said, Mr. Silver looks forward to responding to them -- in court -- and ultimately his full exoneration."" Silver, who was released on bail, spoke briefly to reporters as he left court. ""I am confident that when all the issues are aired, I will be vindicated,"" he said, according to CNN affiliate NY1. In a criminal complaint, prosecutors said Silver abused his political influence and ""obtained about $4 million in payments characterized as attorney referral fees solely through the corrupt use of his official position."" ""We hold our elected representatives to the highest standards and expect them to act in the best interest of their constituents,"" FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Richard Frankel said in a statement. ""In good faith, we trust they will do so while defending the fundamental tenets of the legal system. But as we are reminded today, those who make the laws don't have the right to break the laws."" Read the complaint . The lawmaker, who has been Assembly speaker for more than two decades, allegedly masked the payments from public scrutiny by disguising the graft as income from what he claimed was a personal injury law practice, according to the complaint. ""Over his decades in office, Speaker Silver has amassed titanic political power,""  Bharara told reporters. ""During that same time, Silver also amassed a tremendous personal fortune."" The criminal complaint highlights the role of power and influence in what Bharara described as the ""show-me-the-money culture of Albany."" ""These charges go to the very core of what ails Albany -- a lack of transparency, lack of accountability, and lack of principle joined with an overabundance of greed, cronyism, and self-dealing,"" Bharara said in a statement. The complaint outlined an elaborate, alleged corruption scheme driven by influence and greed, including the siphoning of state funds to a doctor referring cases to the law firm where Silver worked and securing tax breaks for real estate developers. The graft provided Silver about $700,000 in kickbacks from steering two real estate developers with business before the state to a law firm connected to the speaker, according to the complaint. In addition, Silver allegedly collected more than $3 million in asbestos client referral fees. He received those fees by, among other official acts, awarding $500,000 in state grants to a university research center of a physician who referred patients with asbestos-related illnesses to Silver at the law firm where he worked, the complaint said. Prosecutors also accuse Silver of actively interfering with the work of the state's Moreland Commission to Investigate Public Corruption so it would not learn of his illegal income, including negotiating with Cuomo to prematurely end the commission. The panel issued subpoenas seeking information on the the outside income earned by lawmakers. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat, appointed members of the anti-corruption commission in 2013, but disbanded the panel one year later in exchange for changes in campaign finance reporting requirements and bribery laws for the Legislature, the complaint said. Bharara said Cuomo's decision came as ""great relief"" to Silver. Cuomo's office declined to comment but, in a meeting with the New York Daily News editorial board, the governor called Silver's arrest ""a bad reflection on the government"" and said the case against the speaker ""vindicates"" the commission's work. Bharara told reporters that a number of other public corruption investigations were continuing. ""You should stay tuned,"" he warned. The state Assembly canceled its session on Thursday. Silver can continue to serve as speaker despite his arrest but would have to leave office if convicted of a felony, according to NY1. Born on Manhattan's Lower East Side, Silver is a graduate of Yeshiva University and Brooklyn Law School.","One of New York state's most powerful politicians arrested on graft charges .

"(CNN)A little more than a minute. That's all it took for the exchange to turn deadly. The Police Department in Bridgeton, New Jersey, released video this week showing the death of Jerame Reid, 36, who was shot on the night of December 30. He was a passenger in a car that got pulled over for allegedly failing to stop at a stop sign. The dashcam video shows what happened next. Officer Braheme Days approaches the passenger side door. He asks how the two men inside the car are doing and identifies himself. The conversation is friendly. Days asks to see a driver's license. Suddenly, he steps back from the vehicle and pulls his weapon. Days shouts over and over: ""Show me your hands! ... Don't you f****** move!"" He yells at his partner, Roger Worley: ""Get 'em out the car, Rog. We got a gun in this glove compartment."" Days reaches into the car and removes what appears to be a silver handgun. The shouting continues. ""I'll telling you, I'm going to shoot you! You're going to be f****** dead!"" screams the officer. ""You reach for something you're going to be f****** dead."" And later: ""He's reaching! He's reaching!"" Despite the officer's entreaties, Reid appears to push his way out of the passenger side door. He gets out of the car with his hands in front of him. Both Days and Worley open fire. Reid drops to the ground. The vehicle's other occupant did not appear to be injured. He got out of the car, lay on the ground and was handcuffed. A December statement from the local prosecutor's office did not identify the driver. It said a handgun was revealed and recovered during the stop. Both officers have been placed on administrative leave, and an investigation into the use of deadly force is ongoing, the statement said. Bridgeton Police Capt. Michael Gaimari described Days and Worley as ""very good officers"" responsible for ""a lot of key arrests."" Another statement released this week said: ""The Cumberland County Prosecutor's Office is committed to conducting a thorough, fair and impartial investigation into the police-involved shooting death of Jerame Reid. Requests for the release of additional information while the confidential investigation is ongoing stand in the way of completing a neutral, objective and independent evaluation of the facts. This observation is not unique to this matter."" Gaimari said Days was one of four officers who arrested Reid last August on charges that included resisting arrest, drug possession, intent to distribute and failure to appear. The disposition of the case was not immediately known. In addition, Reid had been arrested six times by Bridgeton police since 2009 on charges of making terroristic threats, harassment, burglary, obstruction, marijuana possession and stalking, according to police records. The disposition of each case is unknown. Police and court records list Reid's first name as Jerome, but the prosecutor's office listed it as Jerame. In New Jersey, some local leaders are demanding that the state take over the investigation. ""Jerome put his hand ups,"" said Walter Hudson, chairman and founder of the National Awareness Alliance. ""You can see Jerome's hands are clearly up."" The Police Department reportedly released the video after a public records request was made by the South Jersey Times. Does video of police tell the whole truth? CNN's Ray Sanchez and Haimy Assefa contributed to this report.","A New Jersey police officer shoots and kills a passenger in a car .

"Washington (CNN)Bill Clinton has had a number of glory days since he played church league basketball in Arkansas. But in an interview on Thursday, the former president reminisced about the unexpected high point in his athletic life. Clinton called into the Mike & Mike show on ESPN Radio to talk about Humana Challenge PGA Tour event this weekend in California. The event is partly run by the Clinton Foundation and coincides with a Clinton foundation summit on personal health. But the hosts, Mike Greenberg and Mike Golic, got the former president to talk about that time he ""almost"" dunked a basketball in a church league game. ""I was in a church league. I wasn't very good, I was too heavy. But I would run pretty well in short distances,"" Clinton said. ""One night I was the leading scorer on our team. I scored 16 points in a church league game, never have before or since."" He then added, ""And I nearly dunked a ball! And I was only, at the time, six feet tall. I don't know what happened. It was just one of those magical nights. My hand got like right at the rim and I almost got the ball dunked in. I figured maybe every human being on earth is granted one good day in a sports game."" Clinton has long been an avid sports fan and has remarked in the past that he watched more games while his wife, Hillary Clinton, was traveling for work as secretary of state. While in the White House, Clinton also had the opportunity -- as all presidents do -- to congratulate and meet championship teams from the major U.S. sports leagues, something, he said, he ""really, really enjoyed."" ""I had incredible encounters with some of the athletes that would say hilarious things to me,"" Clinton said remembering those meetings.

"(CNN)In his first public remarks since being accused of having sex with an underage American woman, Britain Prince Andrews briefly addressed the allegation before a crowd in Davos, Switzerland. ""Firstly, I think I must, want, for the record to refer to the events that have taken place in the last three weeks. And I just wish to reiterate and to reaffirm the statements which have already been made on my behalf by Buckingham Palace,"" he said Thursday at the World Economic Forum. Earlier this month, Buckingham Palace issued a statement which said, ""It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York [Andrew] had any form of sexual contact or relationship"" with the woman. ""Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation."" Andrew is a son of Queen Elizabeth II and a brother of Prince Charles, the next in line for the British throne. The prince is accused of having sex with the woman when she was 17, details of which are is a sworn affidavit in Florida court dated January 19. The woman said that she and the Prince had sex ""three times, including one orgy."" The court documents showed that her lawyers had sent a letter to Buckingham Palace asking to interview the prince under oath. In her sworn affidavit, the woman described Buckingham Palace's denial that sexual contact ever took place between the pair as ""false and hurtful to me."" The woman, identified by Buckingham Palace as Virginia Roberts, first named the prince in a civil motion filed December 30 in the U.S. District Court in southern Florida in which she claims she was forced to have sex with several men. She is referred to as Jane Doe No. 3 in the legal filings. In the letter the woman's lawyers sent to Buckingham Palace, attorneys Paul Cassell and Bradley Edwards asked to interview Prince Andrew ""under oath regarding interactions that you had with Jane Doe No. 3 beginning in approximately early 2001. Jane Doe No. 3 was then 17 years old."" The letter includes a picture of the woman and Andrew which was taken around that time, they say. The lawyers also want to discuss subsequent interactions with their client in New York City later that year, the letter says. ""The interview could be conducted at a time and place of your choosing, and with your cooperation, I believe the interview could be completed in two hours or less,"" it says. New court pleadings involving the relationship between Jane Doe No. 3 and the prince are being prepared, the letter adds, but their filing will be delayed if Andrew accepts the interview request by January 19. The attorney for her legal team confirmed to CNN that Buckingham Palace had refused to accept the letter to Prince Andrew and that it was returned to them. Buckingham Palace didn't respond Thursday when asked by CNN about the letter. But the woman's allegations have previously been firmly rejected by Buckingham Palace. ""It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation,"" the palace said early this month. Prince Andrew is named in the court filing in Florida as one of a number of prominent people who allegedly had sexual contact with teenage girls through self-made billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who pleaded guilty some years ago in Florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation. CNN was unable to reach Martin Weinberg, Epstein's attorney, on Thursday. In her first sworn statement to the court, Jane Doe No. 3 gave more details of the alleged encounters. ""Epstein made me have sex with Prince Andrew several times,"" she said, according to the court document. ""I had sex with him three times, including one orgy. I knew he was a member of the British Royal Family, but I just called him 'Andy.' "" One day when she was in London, she said, Epstein told her she would be meeting a ""major prince."" She continued: ""Epstein told me 'to exceed' everything I had been taught. He emphasized that whatever Prince Andrew wanted, I was to make sure he got."" When the prince arrived, she was introduced, she said, and ""we kissed formally, cheek to cheek."" The group went for dinner and to a nightclub where she was served alcohol before returning to the townhouse. The picture referred to in the letter, of the prince with Roberts, was taken there, she said. After the pair were left alone, she said, ""We went to the bathroom and bedroom, which were just steps away from where the picture was taken. We engaged in sexual activities there. Afterwards, Andy left quickly with his security."" She said she had reported back to Epstein on the encounter next day, telling him, ""It went great."" ""I told Epstein about Andy's sexual interests in feet. Epstein thought it was very funny. Epstein appeared to be collecting private information about Andy,"" she added. Roberts also gave details of two more alleged occasions when the pair had sex. One was in Epstein's New York mansion in spring 2001, she said, when she was 17. The third and last occasion was at an orgy involving nine girls on Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, her statement said. ""I was around 18 at the time. Epstein, Andy, approximately eight other young girls, and I had sex together."" The other girls, who appeared to be under 18, were ""European looking and sounding"" and didn't really speak English, she said. She said she ""felt disgusted"" after the orgy. Roberts rejected the palace's denial of the allegations and said she hoped Andrew would agree to be interviewed under oath. ""I did have sexual contact with him as I have described here -- under oath,"" she said. ""Given what he knows and has seen, I was hoping that he would simply voluntarily tell the truth about everything."" Roberts and another woman are seeking to join two other women who are arguing in federal court for the U.S. government to reexamine its case involving Epstein. The investment banker agreed to a state plea deal in 2007 and began serving an 18-month sentence in 2008, according to court documents. He pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and procurement of a minor for prostitution.

"(CNN)The United Nations' top human rights official has called on Myanmar's leaders to ""unequivocally condemn"" an ultra-nationalist Buddhist monk who labeled a visiting U.N. rapporteur a ""whore"" at a protest. Ashin Wirathu, the leader of the far-right, anti-Muslim 969 movement, made the remarks about Yanghee Lee, the U.N.'s Special Rapporteur on Myanmar, at a public rally on Friday. ""Don't assume you are a respectable person, just because of your position,"" he said in the speech, footage of which was widely circulated on social media. ""To us, you are just a whore."" The comments drew a sharp response from the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, who described Wirathu's remarks as ""sexist,"" ""insulting"" and ""utterly unacceptable."" ""I call on religious and political leaders in Myanmar to unequivocally condemn all forms of incitement to hatred, including this abhorrent public personal attack,"" he said in a statement released from Geneva Wednesday. ""It's intolerable for U.N. Special Rapporteurs to be treated in this way."" Lee was on a 10-day visit reporting on the human rights situation in the predominantly Buddhist southeast Asian country, which is emerging from a half-century of military rule. She had spoken out about the crisis facing the country's 1.3 million-strong Rohingya Muslim minority, most of whom live under apartheid-like conditions in Rakhine state, with limited access to adequate healthcare and education. Since an outbreak of communal violence between Buddhists and Muslims in 2012, more than 130,000 live in wretched displacement camps they are forbidden to leave. Lee also criticized proposed law changes backed by the monks, including a bill restricting interfaith marriage and religious conversions. She made reference to Wirathu's comments in a statement this week. ""During my visit, I was personally subjected to the kind of sexist intimidation that female human rights defenders experience when advocating on controversial issues,"" she said. Wirathu was jailed in 2003 for inciting anti-Muslim violence, but released in an amnesty nine years later. Myanmar's Minister of Information and presidential spokesperson Ye Htut  posted comments on his Facebook page indicating he would ask the Ministry of Religious Affairs to look into Wirathu's speech.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney are set to meet in Utah on Thursday for a meeting that Bush scheduled before Romney announced this month that he's seriously considering a third presidential run. A senior Republican strategist familiar with the plans, speaking only on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the sit-down was put in the books some time ago, ""in the couple to several weeks range."" The source said the meeting, which was first reported by The New York Times on Wednesday, was requested by Bush as a gesture of respect for Romney's leadership role in the party â€” much like a recent Bush-John McCain meeting that took place at Bush's request. And now? ""Well obviously Governor Romney has changed the dynamics,"" the source said. Separately, two Romney sources and a senior Bush source confirmed that the meeting will take place. Bush was spotted Thursday morning by CBS News boarding a flight from Washington to Salt Lake City. Asked if it was true he's meeting with Romney, Bush responded: ""I like to ski. I can't comment."" When he arrived in Salt Lake City, he was met by a crowd of reporters and supporters who followed him from the gate through the airport. One man approached Bush and handed him what looked like a business card. ""I'm a Republican. I'm in the oil business. And I'm an actor,"" the man said. ""And I voted for your dad."" ""Thank you,"" Bush said, accepting the card as he continued to walk. Bush briefly signed autographs outside and was followed by the small flock until he got into an SUV. ""Thank you, Mr. President,"" one man shouted. The former Florida governor's itinerary this week also includes a speech Friday in San Francisco at the National Automobile Dealers Association convention. Romney told a group of donors in New York on Jan. 9 that he was angling towards another run at the White House, less than a month after Bush jumped to Republican frontrunner status following his own announcement that he was actively exploring a bid. The Romney announcement shook the early 2016 pre-presidential campaign and sparked confusion and competition as both men were now courting similar donors and influential Republicans behind the scenes. Making the competition more tense was a new CBS News poll this week that showed nearly six in 10 Republicans want Romney to run for president, while 50% feel the same about Bush. One reporter at the airport in Utah asked if the meeting would be awkward. ""No,"" Bush replied flatly. At times, their paths have almost crossed. Romney spoke publicly at last week's Republican National Committee meeting in San Diego, for example, while Bush was also in Southern California courting donors. Their circles are further overlapping as the two potential candidates start to staff up. CNN's Mark Preston reported earlier this week that two of Romney's former aides -- Megan Sowards and Matt Gorman -- are poised to play key roles in a potential Bush campaign. Ever since the prospect of a third Romney campaign became serious, Bush has played nice about his potential competitor. According to Bloomberg Politics, Bush praised the 2012 nominee at a private fundraiser Wednesday in Washington, saying he doesn't expect he'll need to wage ugly campaigns against his opponents to win a primary. Neither Bush nor Romney are scheduled so far to attend a major gathering of conservatives this weekend in Iowa. Nearly 10 prospective Republican candidates, including Gov. Chris Christie, will speak at the Iowa Freedom Summit in Des Moines on Saturday hosted by Citizens United and Rep. Steve King. While Bush's absence has stoked speculation that the former governor might plan to leave the first-in-the-nation caucus state out of his campaign strategy, Bush called the state's GOP chairman on Wednesday to assure him that he plans to make Iowa a priority, the Des Moines Register reported. ""What I heard is a man that's ready to come out and tackle the Hawkeye state,"" Kaufmann said, though he noted that Bush stressed he's still only considering a run and hasn't become an official candidate. Last week Ted Gatsas, mayor of Manchester, New Hampshire, tweeted that Bush had called him and told him he plans on coming to the Granite State, which holds the nominating season's first primary, at some point, according to the Union Leader. CNN's Dana Bash and Gloria Borger contributed to this report.","Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush are scheduled to meet this week in Utah, a source says .

"(CNN)For more than nine years on the throne, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah faced a tough balancing act. Calls to modernize his kingdom were constant. So, too, were objections from hard-line conservatives who chafed at change. Supporters hailed Abdullah, who died Friday at age 90, as a reformer. And in the United States, leaders have long described him as a close ally in the Middle East who played a key role in bringing stability to the region. He famously held hands with President George W. Bush as the two leaders met in Texas in 2005. With the wealth of his oil-rich nation behind him, Abdullah wielded far-reaching influence both inside and outside Saudi Arabia. As the U.S.-led campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria ramped up, his leadership was a ""game changer,"" Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a professor of political science at Emirates University, told CNN last year. ""It was King Abdullah who put all the moral, the political weight behind the international coalition to stop ISIS's momentum,"" he said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry described Abdullah as a ""revered leader"" around the world. ""He was so proud of the Kingdom's journey,"" Kerry said in a statement, ""a brave partner in fighting violent extremism who proved just as important as a proponent of peace."" Under Abdullah's leadership, the country slowly squashed al Qaeda, capturing or killing its leaders in the kingdom, forcing the remnants underground and sidelining radical preachers. In 2005, Abdullah launched a campaign through the country's media and its mosques to educate Saudi citizens about the danger of extremism. At the same time, the king -- unlike some of his predecessors -- began investing the country's oil wealth in creating jobs for the future. A massive building program, called King Abdullah Economic City, was one example -- and an acknowledgment that oil money wouldn't last forever. The king focused on ramping up education, too. King Abdullah University of Science and Technology was designed to be the first coed university in the country. Some of his more conservative ministers -- his half-brothers -- bridled at his changes. They weren't the only Saudis disappointed with his leadership. Many women had hoped for greater independence under his rule. But their dreams were not realized during his lifetime. He initiated forums for women to debate issues, but failed in the face of opposition to give them real freedom. Under Saudi Arabia's strict rules, women cannot marry, leave the country, go to school or open bank accounts without permission from a male guardian, who usually is the father or husband. Much of public life is segregated by gender and women are not allowed to drive. Even as he ran up against limits to what he could achieve inside Saudi Arabia, beyond its borders Abdullah saw the kingdom's stature grow. It was the only Arab nation with a seat at the G20, and also became the lead Arab nation in the U.S.-led coalition to eradicate ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Abdullah bolstered the desert kingdom's defense forces with a massive $150 billion infusion, and he backed Egypt's military rulers who ousted the Muslim Brotherhood from power. A spokesman for United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon praised Abdullah's ""efforts to address regional and international challenges at a time of turmoil and rapid change, and to promote dialogue among the world's faiths."" U.S. President Barack Obama pointed to Abdullah's work advancing the Arab Peace Initiative, which attempts to solve the long-simmering conflict between Israel and Palestine. ""King Abdullah left a tangible legacy that can still point the way toward peace in the Middle East,"" the U.N. secretary-general's spokesman said. In 2010, Newsweek called King Abdullah one of the world's 10 most respected leaders, praising his efforts ""to lift his ultraconservative country from the dark ages."" ""He's given the go-ahead to modernize schools, has appointed women to high office, and invested in science and technology education and nuclear power initiatives. He's also proven a stalwart ally against Islamic extremism, delivering a much-applauded speech in Mecca that called on Muslims to embrace 'the spirit of tolerance, moderation, and balance,'"" the Newsweek article said. But not everyone felt like Abdullah deserved his reformist moniker. Another headline in Foreign Policy magazine that year described him this way: ""Those who predicted the Saudi monarch would bring real change to the kingdom had it wrong. His real goal has been to tighten his family's grip on power."" ""Despite the new levels of openness enjoyed by Saudi citizens, Abdullah is not leading the kingdom on the path to political liberalism. Just the opposite: While making small social and economic concessions, the king is in fact turning the clock back in Arabia, using his popularity to confront clergy and restore the kind of unchecked authority his family enjoyed in the 1970s,"" Toby C. Jones, an associate professor of history at Rutgers, wrote in an analysis for the magazine. Ali Al-Ahmed, a former Saudi political prisoner, told CNN on Thursday that it isn't accurate to portray Abdullah as a reformer. Under Abdullah's rule, he said, political prisoners were harshly punished and extremism flourished in Saudi Arabia even as leaders claimed to oppose it. ""It's the epicenter of extremism, of terrorism, of funding terrorism. ... Reforms in Saudi Arabia do not exist. This is an absolute monarchy, let's be honest,"" Al-Ahmed said. ""This is an absolute monarchy where the government policies are controlled by one family. They decide everything."" CNN's Sarah Aarthun, Laura Smith-Spark and Becky Anderson contributed to this report.","Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has died after more than nine years on the throne .

"(CNN)It was one of hundreds of small businesses looted after a St. Louis County grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer in the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager. Surveillance video released by the St. Louis County Police Department on Wednesday shows looters at the Dellwood Market, just outside Ferguson, Missouri, following the November 24 grand jury decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson in the August death of teenager Michael Brown. A group of men is seen in the video futilely trying to break down the reinforced door. They pull and pull. With a stick or metal rod, they try to pry the door open. When all those efforts fail, they shatter a glass pane in the display window and barrel through a sheet of plywood behind the glass. A wave of looters -- at least 180, according to St. Louis County police -- can be seen in the video pouring into the small business. For several minutes, they are seen walking back out the way they came in. Some carry bottles of liquor and other merchandise; others haul boxes of goods. Stragglers arrive late and take some of what little is left. The owner of Dellwood Market, a family-owned business, was home watching the looting live on his surveillance system. ""My dad has had this place for 25 years,"" said Jan Lalani, 33, who took over the market about a year ago. ""It's been his livelihood for a long time."" During three bouts of looting between the time Brown was shot in the summer of 2014 and November's grand jury decision, Lalani estimates the business sustained about $300,000 in damages and losses. ""The first time we were hit in August it was like watching an action movie from Hollywood,"" Lalani said. ""In November, it was more the thought,  'Oh my God, not again.' I didn't even know what to think."" The surveillance video released by police only shows about five minutes of what happened that November night but, Lalani said, the looting started about 11 p.m. and continued until about 6 a.m. He estimates that more than 300 people ransacked the store during that time. ""I was at home looking at it while it was going on,"" Lalani said. St. Louis County Police are making video and still images of the Dellwood incident and others public in hopes of arresting some of the looters. Shawn McGuire, a police spokesman, said the release of the videos has taken time because detectives not only are working the looting cases but also current crimes. They hope people in the community will help identify the looters. ""It's pretty shocking,"" McGuire said. ""Even if we get one person identified from releasing the video it's a success."" The St. Louis Economic Development Partnership estimates that about 250 businesses in the area were affected by the disturbances from August through November, including looting, vandalism and other damage. The group is still working on a monetary estimate of the loses, partnership spokeswoman Kathryn Jamboretz said. At Dellwood Market, looters ran off with everything from toothpaste to cigarettes to frozen foods. Of some 2,000 bottles of liquor on the shelves, Lalani said, only about 40 remained that November morning. Still, Lalani said his family was fortunate. Looters twice tried to set the market on fire. Both times, he said, police officers arrived shortly after to extinguish the flames. ""For me, personally, thinking about coming in to work is not the same,"" Lalani said. ""But my relationship with the customers is still the same. We have so many great people coming in and showing their support and giving us hope.""","Video shows looters at the Dellwood Market just outside Ferguson, Missouri .

"(CNN)Residents in portions of New Mexico and Texas were dealing Thursday with a rare winter storm. More than a foot of snow had fallen just south of Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. The National Weather Service says Amarillo recorded its 11th snowiest day on record, dating back to 1892. El Paso, Texas, and Las Cruces, New Mexico, accustomed to only a wintry dusting, were seeing more than their usual share of the white stuff. On Thursday, snow continued to fall in eastern New Mexico and El Paso, where several road closures and school closures were announced. The Texas Department of Transportation was warning motorists to stay off the roads and watch for black ice on roadways in the El Paso area. New Mexico State Police tweeted several road closures and crashes due to ""whiteout conditions."" Notably, Interstate 10 westbound was closed in Las Cruces, where up to 5 inches of snow was recorded by midday.  Up to a foot of snow fell east of Raton, New Mexico, in the town of Folsom, said the National Weather Service.

"(CNN)When Barack Obama heads to India this weekend to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he will be both the first U.S. president to attend as Chief Guest and the first U.S. president to visit India twice during his term of office. But despite Obama's warm rhetoric and talk of U.S.-India ties being a ""defining partnership of the 21st century,"" the man of the hour when I was visiting India last month was a different world leader: Vladimir Putin. ""Russia has been India's foremost defense partner through decades. ... Russia will remain our foremost defense partner,"" Modi explained during the Russian President's visit, adding that the ""strategic partnership"" between the two countries was ""incomparable."" These comments followed Modi's claim to Putin at the BRICS summit last summer that: ""Even a child in India, if asked to say who is India's best friend, will reply it is Russia because Russia has been with India in times of crisis."" Throw in India's soothing expression of ""understanding"" over Russia's actions in Ukraine, and it is hard not to wonder whether Modi's words are more than just the kinds of diplomatic platitudes you might expect from a gracious host. Indeed, even as Modi signed off a speech in Central Park with the words ""May the force be with you,"" I was reminded of another classic American film series -- ""Back to the Future"" -- and wondered whether Modi's encouraging words to Putin might reflect a certain nostalgia for days gone by. True, since the fall of the Soviet Union and India's economic reforms, the world's two largest democracies have done their best to put the days of Cold War estrangement behind them: The United States has cooperated with India extensively on terrorism and maritime security, and India conducts more military exercises with the United States (India's largest defense supplier) than any other nation. In addition, the United States has done the heavy lifting in trying to bring India into the international civil nuclear community. And even India's traditional concern over the U.S.-Pakistan relationship seems to have eased in recent years. Yet as the State Department has noted, the India-Russia defense deals announced during Putin's visit come at a particularly bad time. For the first time since World War II, Europe has a leader in Putin who evidently believes it is acceptable to alter international boundaries through the use of force. One would think an India disputing Chinese and Pakistani territorial claims to entire Indian states would be particularly wary of the embrace of a former KGB agent who was so quick to force his own way. But even setting aside India's inconsistency on this, it is unclear what practical benefits India should see in wanting to so closely ally itself with a country whose currency is being severely devalued, whose economy is reeling from falling oil prices and international sanctions, whose trade with India is less than a tenth of that with the United States, and whose planes India has bought, even as questions are now raised about their reliability. In fact, the reality is that since the Cold War, Russia has been largely missing in action in regard to India. The views of Russia expressed during the Putin visit therefore seem largely formed by Cold War relations between India and the Soviet Union rather than present reality. But perhaps most importantly of all, this apparent nostalgia raises the question of how India's policy toward Russia can be reconciled with Indian values of democracy, the rule of law, and individual liberty -- values shared with the United States and that are often cited by leaders and citizens, including the 3.8 million Indian Americans who have helped build the natural partnership between the United States and India. Because unfortunately, these democratic values are being steadily eroded in Russia under Putin (the criminal prosecution of opposition leader Alexei Navalny being but the latest example), who has derided talk of them as American attempts to impose a sort of cultural imperialism. Both India and the United States need to work with Russia on a variety of issues. But this no time for reverting to relations of a bygone era. Most Indians, and a large number of Americans, were not even alive when the Soviet Union and India were the best of friends -- an era the United States and India should be working to put behind them by looking to a future in which U.S. and Indian school children will recognize their respective nations as best friends. For this to happen, the U.S. and India must act accordingly.","Barack Obama arrives for a visit in India this weekend .
