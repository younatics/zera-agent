"By . Jonathan Block . Asim Taylor, 35, owes nearly $100,000 in such payments. The 9th District Court Circuit of Appeals on Monday made its decision, upholding a ruling made in January 2013 by Lorain County Probate Judge James Walther against Taylor. Lorain County Probate Judge James Walther (center) issues the order in January 2013 barring Asim Taylor (left) from having any more children until he pays $100,000 in child support payments. His lawyer, Doug Merrill, is to Taylor's right . Taylor’s attorney, Doug Merrill, said he . plans to appeal the decision to the Ohio Supreme Court as he has . previously argued that the order violates Taylor’s right to reproduce. He said the only way his client can guarantee compliance with Walther’s . order, which requires Taylor to make all reasonable efforts to avoid . impregnating a woman,' is by abstaining from sex. 'Indeed, we have little to go on other . than what the trial court said in its journal entries, which is itself . limited,' Appeals Judge Carla Moore wrote in the majority decision for the appellate court. 'We . therefore have no choice in this case but to presume the regularity of . the community control sanctions and to affirm.' When Walther imposed the order in 2003, he called it 'a matter of common sense and personal responsibility.' He told the Chronicle-Telegram on Monday that the decision allows him to level similar sanctions against defendants in case that are similar to Taylor's. Asim Taylor, 35, of Elyria, Ohio, who has been barred by a judge from having more children unless he pays back $100,000 in back child support payment . Still, Walther was not completely satisfied with the appellate decision. 'I’m happy they upheld me, but I’m disappointed they didn’t decide on the merits,' he said. The high court in Ohio has previously ruled in such a case. In 2004, it struck down a similar order, though on technical ground. A lower court judge had neglected to include a way to have the order lifted. Walther’s order, however, addressed that issue by stating that the order would be lifted if Taylor could show he was taking responsibility for supporting his children, Judge Donna Carr, who delved into the issue more fully than her colleagues in a concurring opinion for the appellate court.","An Ohio Appeals Court has upheld an order imposed in January 2013 by a lower court judge against 35-year-old Asim Taylor .

"By . James Rush . A U.S. Marine was saved by his dog after it called 911 on his iPhone when he collapsed from a seizure. Terry McGlade, from Zanesville, Ohio, who was injured when he was hit by an IED in Afghanistan, said his retriever-pit bull cross Major has been trained to help when he has a seizure. Mr McGlade, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, said the dog managed to get the phone out of his pocket before placing his paw on the screen for several seconds, which caused it to automatically dial 911. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . U.S. Marine Terry McGlade has said he was saved by his dog after it called 911 when he collapsed from a seizure . Mr McGlade said the dog managed to get the phone out of his pocket before placing his paw on the screen for several seconds, which caused it to automatically dial 911 . Dispatchers sent help after receiving several calls from the dog, who then went to wait at the front of the house to take police and medics to his owner, ABC6 reported. Mr McGlade said: 'I probably would have been in severe trouble if he wouldn't have called.' Last month MailOnline reported how a Labrador-springer spaniel-cross called Judy had twice rescued her 61-year-old owner from death. The first life-saving act was four years ago when Judy helped bring Sharon Brookes a Mars bar after she fell into a diabetic coma. The latest occasion however was when Judy managed to dislodge a piece of toast from Miss Brookes's throat after she started choking in her home in Little Hereford, Ludlow, Shropshire. Miss Brookes, who has had Judy since she was a puppy, said: 'There was nobody else in the house and I just thought that was it - I thought I was a goner. I wouldn’t be here without her.' Mr McGlade said Major has been trained to help when he has a seizure . Pensioner Miss Brookes was snacking on toast in her kitchen when a piece got stuck in her throat. When she started to choke, her faithful dog knew something was wrong and jumped to the rescue. Judy 'punched' Miss Brookes on the back and managed to dislodge the food.","Terry McGlade said his dog has been trained to help when he has a seizure .

"By . Ted Thornhill . The judge at the Oscar Pistorius trial has ruled that the double-amputee will be sent for psychiatric evaluation after an expert said that he suffered from an anxiety disorder that gave him 'hyper-vigilance'. Psychiatrist Dr Merryll Vorster, for the defence, said that Pistorius' condition is linked to his disability and meant that he was prone to fight, rather than take flight, in the presence of perceived danger. If Pistorius' condition is found to have played a role in the fatal shooting of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in his home on February 14, 2013, then he may escape a murder charge.

Deep in conversation: Oscar Pistorius (left) speaks with his uncle Arnold Pistorius (right) during his trial at the high court in Pretoria on Tuesday . Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius listens to the State Prosecutor during his trial at the high court in Pretoria, on Tuesday . It means that the trial - already on its 32nd day - will be delayed. Judge Thokozile Masipa said the court would hand down . the details of the assessment on Tuesday, adding it would be preferable . for him to undergo the evaluation as an outpatient. The decision on Wednesday by Masipa followed a request for a psychiatric evaluation by the . chief prosecutor, Gerrie Nel. Nel questioned why the defense decided to ask Dr Vorster to testify on behalf of the Olympic runner. He has suggested that the trial is not going well for Pistorius and that his lawyers are floating the idea that a disorder contributed to Steenkamp's shooting and that therefore Pistorius bears less responsibility for her death. Pistorius says he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder when he shot her through the closed door of a toilet cubicle. Prosecutors say he killed her in anger after an argument. Professor Craig Jackson, Head of Psychology at Birmingham City University, explained to MailOnline more about the condition that it's claimed Oscar Pistorius has. 'Hyper-vigilance is more of a behavioural symptom of wider psychological problems than an actual psychiatric condition in itself,' he said. 'Hyper-vigilance is when an individual is in a chronic state of high anxiety and arousal and is constantly scanning their surroundings - the environment they are in, as well as friends and the people they encounter - for threats. 'This is often as the result of suffering a traumatic or frightening experience. After a while this state becomes second nature to the fearful individual and begins to shape their routine behaviours - for example always checking behind closed doors when entering a room, or assessing new places for the nearest emergency exit. 'Those who are hyper-vigilant are often easily startled, suffer from poor sleeping patterns, may have difficulty concentrating, and can be quite quarrelsome, spontaneous and irritable. 'Hyper-vigilance is one of the symptoms required in order for psychiatrists to make a diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) alongside other symptoms of intense fear such as avoidance, re-experience, flashbacks and intense arousal. 'Not everyone who suffers traumatic events will go on to develop PTSD or hyper-vigilance, and there may be other underlying personality factors or past experiences that make it more likely to manifest in some rather than others, such as narcissism or high intelligence.' Pistorius is hugged by a supporter on his arrival for Tuesday's trial . Cross-examination: Prosecutor Gerrie Nel questions psychiatrist Meryl Vorster at the Pistorius trial . In asking for another professional evaluation of Pistorius' mental state, Nel appeared to be trying to ward off any attempt by the defense to say Pistorius should be treated favorably by the court because of a mental condition linked to his disability. Pistorius' chief lawyer, Barry Roux, said at the start of defense-led testimony that the double amputee's vulnerability and disability was at the center of his case of a mistaken killing. He said Pistorius should not be sent for 30 days of psychiatric evaluation and that he wanted to call another witness to continue testimony. The psychiatrist, Vorster, met Pistorius this month, prompting the prosecutor to question whether the timing of her late entry to the stable of defense witnesses signified a change in tactics by the defense, which has said Pistorius fired out of fear that he was about to be attacked.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Greg Hardy, 25, faces two charges after his girlfriend reported that he battered her Tuesday . One of the Carolina Panthers' biggest stars has been arrested on charges that he beat and threatened his girlfriend at his downtown condo in Charlotte, North Carolina. Greg Hardy, 25, whose ferocity as a defensive end earned him the nickname 'Da Kraken,' was jailed Tuesday on charges of assault on a woman and communicating threats. His 24-year-old girlfriend had bruises and scratches when police arrived at Hardy's condo about 4am Tuesday, according to a report. She told officers that she had been dating the 6-foot-4 Pro Bowl player since last September. She had been drinking at the time of the alleged attack, according to police. The domestic violence arrest is just the latest trouble for Hardy - who saw his position in the 2010 NFL draft fall after teams became concerned over his off-the-field behavior, the Charlotte Observer reports. Hardy is one of the biggest stars on the Panthers. He recorded 15 sacks last year, a franchise record, and was named to the Pro Bowl. The team is currently in negotiations to sign him to a long-term contract and make him the highest-paid player on the team. He was named a 'franchise' player and is owed a contact that will pay him at least $13.1million this year - a tenfold increase from his $1.3million salary last year. At the University of Mississippi, Hardy was suspended for two games for missing meetings and violating rules. Hardy's on-the-field alter ego is Da Kraken, a nickname he earned because of his ferocity. He recorded 15 sacks last year . In 2011, he crashed his motorcycle and received injuries that kept him out of most pre-season training. In the summer 2012, he tweeted a picture of the speedometer of his Bentley clocking over 100mph. Last season, he was benched and fined by the team after missing a team meeting. He was forced to apologize to the head coach before he could return. He has also been ticketed three times for speeding - including once going 86mph in a 65mph zone.","Greg Hardy, 25, faces charges of assault on a woman and communicating threats .

"By . Lydia Warren . and Snejana Farberov . 'Predator': Tyler Kost, 18, allegedly raped a 15-year-old girl but it was miscoded by a counselor . A Planned Parenthood counselor intentionally noted a rape by an allegedly prolific teen sexual predator as consensual to avoid the 'hassle' of reporting it, according to a police report. The encounter allegedly involved Tyler Kost, 18, from San Tan Valley, Arizona, who has been charged with sexually assaulting 11 girls between October 2009 and April 2014 - although cops believe he may have attacked as many as 18. One of his alleged victims was a 15-year-old girl who became pregnant following the assault and when she underwent an abortion through Planned Parenthood last December, her mother told a member of staff about the attack, FoxNews.com reported. 'The counselor intentionally miscoded the . assault as a consensual encounter,' a police report states. 'The counselor . told them that they did not want the hassle of having to report the . assault to law enforcement as they were a mandatory reporter.' Planned Parenthood Arizona told Fox they have contacted the Pinal County Sheriff’s Department and said, if the allegations are true, it would be a 'serious violation' of its policies. Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu added that he was 'troubled' by the allegations about Planned Parenthood and said they had been forwarded to state officials by the victim's mother. 'If this is true, they should absolutely be held accountable,' he said. Scroll down for video . 'Misconduct': A counselor at a Planned Parenthood in Arizona said they did not want the hassle of reporting the alleged assault to law enforcement, according to a police report (file picture) Kost has been indicted on nearly 30 felony counts, including multiple counts of . sexual assault with a minor, sexual abuse with a minor and sexual . conduct with a minor. He also faces a count of child molestation. Pinal . County Attorney Lando Voyles said the victims in the crimes alleged in . the indictment issued Wednesday ranged from 12 to 17 years old. Voyles said the offenses - which involved victims that Kost dated or knew - occurred between October 2009 and April 2014 meaning that Kost . was 13 when the first offense allegedly . took place. But Voyles plans to try him as an adult on all charges. 'In Arizona, once an individual turns 18, we don't have a choice,' Voyles said. '[State law] makes it fairly clear.' Kost, . a senior at Poston Butte High School, would face between 147 and nearly . 334 years in prison if convicted of all the charges in the indictment, . the prosecutor said. Accused: Police said that Kost, pictured, dated some of his alleged victims, including a girl he took to prom . Pinal . County sheriff's deputies arrested Kost two weeks ago, accusing him of . being a serial sex predator who assaulted at least 18 students. But Voyles said he could not comment on why the indictment accused Kost of crimes involving only 11 victims. Arrested: He allegedly told one of the girls to kill herself - and she tried to take her life . Babeu said the baby-faced Kost threatened and harassed victims . to such an extent that two fled the state, and one attempted suicide. 'This is a serious and serial sex offender and rapist,' Babeu said. The . investigation was initiated after the Sheriff's Office received a call . March 25 from someone reporting that Kost had sexually abused and . molested five teenage girls. According . to the indictment, none of the alleged sexual assaults occurred on a . school campus. Kost is accused of abusing the victims in his . bedroom, in a parked car, a park and out in the desert. In one case, Kost threatened, harassed . and told one of the victims to kill herself, deputies said. The girl . followed through and attempted suicide, but survived and was hospitalized. While . in the hospital, she allegedly got a message from Kost threatening . that if she returned to school he would 'make her life a living hell.' In another case, a girl became pregnant after she was allegedly raped by Kost and ended up getting an abortion, the station KPHO reported. 'He . would assault these young female victims in their own bedrooms, in his . bedroom, in the desert, at a community pool, at community parks,' Babeu . said. Detectives said because he looked young and innocent, many people didn't perceive him as a threat. His alleged victims included girls he had dated. He was first jailed April 28 in . connection with sex crimes against one victim and re-arrested three days . later as sheriff's investigators tied additional victims to the case.

"By . Leon Watson . America's second richest man has shown his support for abortion by donating more than $1.2 billion to pro-choice groups in the last decade, it was claimed today. Billionaire Warren Buffett, the so-called 'Sage of Omaha', has pumped cash into a series of trusts and charities offering family planning advice and care between 2001 and 2012. Planned Parenthood, NARAL and Buffett's own charity, The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, which is named after his first wife who campaigned for women's rights, were among the beneficiaries. Scroll down for video . Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO Warren Buffett gestures during an interview on the Fox Business Network in Omaha, Nebraska . Buffett has given $289,811,421 to Planned Parenthood alone since 2001, Fox News reported . According to its webside, Planned Parenthood promotes a 'commonsense approach to women’s health and well-being, based . on respect for each individual’s right to make informed, independent . decisions about health, sex, and family planning'. In 2006, two years after his wife died, Buffett gave the foundation that bears her name a substantial gift. He said that he expected the gift to increase the foundation's annual expenditures by $150 million. In fact, the New York Times reported, total giving by the foundation, where two of the Buffetts' children sit on the board, increased from $202 million in 2007 to $347 million in 2008. Tax returns show that most of the foundation's spending goes to abortion and contraception advocacy and research. According to Access Philanthropy, a research institute that focuses on the giving preferences of foundations and corporate donors, family planning is one of the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation's main purposes. Warren Buffett, left, has shown his support for abortion by donating more than $1.2 billion to pro-choice groups . The foundation's non-profit 990 tax form shows that in 2008, Planned Parenthood and its affiliates in the U.S. received about $45 million; the international arm of the organization got about $8 million. There is no line item for the Ryan program or the Family Planning Fellowship. But the foundation paid out around $50 million to universities with one or both of the programs. Mr Buffett has never spoken publicly about his views on abortion. But in the 1990s, according to The Wall Street Journal, the Buffett Foundation helped finance the research and development of the pills that induce abortion. The foundation also helped finance a lawsuit to overturn the ban on so-called partial-birth abortion in Nebraska, Buffett's home state and the headquarters of his company, Berkshire Hathaway. In Thompson Buffett's only television interview, which was broadcast after her death, she told Charlie Rose: 'Warren feels that women all over the world get shortchanged. That's why he's so pro-choice.' According to sexual health study group the Guttmacher Institute, 1.06 million abortions were performed in 2011, down from 1.21 million abortions in 2008, a decline of 13 per cent. Research also shows the number of U.S. abortion providers declined four per cent between 2008 (1,793) and 2011 (1,720). The number of clinics providing abortion services also declined 1 per cent, from 851 to 839. Overall, 89 per cent of all U.S. counties lacked an abortion clinic in 2011, while only 38 per cent of women live in those counties.","Among the beneficiaries is a charity named after his first wife .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Our methods of finding planets outside the solar system are still very primitive, but we're now getting a stage where we can start taking photos of them. And doing just that, known as direct imaging, a gas giant has been spotted around a star three times less massive than our sun. But what is most striking about this planet, dubbed GU Psc b, is the huge distance at which it orbits its host star - about 2,000 times further than Earth is from the sun, a record among exoplanets. A gas giant planet, artist's impression shown, has been found in an orbit around a star that takes 80,000 years. It is one of the most distant planets from a star that has yet been discovered. It is located around GU Psc, a star three times less massive than the Sun and located in the constellation Pisces . The international research team, led by Marie-Ève Naud, a PhD student in the Department of Physics at the Université de Montréal, was able to find this planet by combining observations from the the Gemini Observatories, the Observatoire Mont-Mégantic (OMM), the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and the W.M. Keck Observatory. Mercury . Time taken to orbit: 87.9 days . Venus . 224.7 days . Earth . 365.25 days . Mars . 686.9 days . Jupiter . 11.9 years . Saturn . 29.4 years . Uranus . 84.3 years . Neptune . 164.8 years . Pluto . 247.7 years . Eris . 560.2 years . GU Psc b . 80,000 years . Given its distance from its star, it takes approximately 80,000 Earth years for GU Psc b to make a complete orbit. The researchers also took advantage of the large distance between the planet and its star to obtain images. By comparing images obtained in different wavelengths (or colours) from the OMM and CFHT, they were able to correctly detect the planet. 'Planets are much brighter when viewed in infrared rather than visible light, because their surface temperature is lower compared to other stars,' says Naud. 'This allowed us to identify GU Psc b.' The researchers were looking around GU Psc because the star had just been identified as a member of the young star group AB Doradus. Young stars (only 100 million years old) are prime targets for planetary detection through imaging because the planets around them are still cooling and are therefore brighter. This does not mean that planets similar to GU Psc b exist in large numbers, as noted by by Étiene Artigau, co-supervisor of Naud's thesis and astrophysicist at the Université de Montréal. 'We observed more than 90 stars and found only one planet, so this is truly an astronomical oddity,' he says. Here the planet GU Psc b and its star GU Psc A are composed of visible and infrared images. Because infrared light is invisible to the naked eye, astronomers use a color code in which infrared light is represented by the color red. GU Psc b is brighter in infrared than in other filters, which is why it appears red in this image . To determine other characteristics of the planet, including its mass, researchers used theoretical models of planetary evolution. The light spectrum of the planet GU Psc b obtained from the Gemini North Observatory in Hawaii was compared to such models to show that it has a temperature of around 800°C (1,500°F). Knowing the age of the star GU Psc due to its location in AB Doradus, the team was able to determine the mass of the planet , which is nine to 13 times that of Jupiter. In the coming years, the astrophysicists hope to detect planets that are similar to GU Psc but much closer to their stars, thanks, among other things, to new instruments such as the GPI (Gemini Planet Imager) recently installed on Gemini South in Chile. The proximity of these planets to their stars will make them much more difficult to observe. GU Psc b is therefore a model for better understanding these objects. The discovery was made by combining observations from the the Gemini Telescope (in the foreground), the Observatoire Mont-Mégantic (OMM), the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT, shown in the background) and the W.M. Keck Observatory . 'GU Psc b is a true gift of nature,' says René Doyon, co-supervisor of Naud's thesis and OMM Director. 'The large distance that separates it . from its star allows it to be studied in depth with a variety of . instruments, which will provide a better understanding of giant . exoplanets in general.' The team has started a project to observe several hundred stars and detect planets lighter than GU Psc b with similar orbits. The discovery of GU Psc, a rare object indeed, raises awareness of the significant distance that can exist between planets and their stars, opening the possibility of searching for planets with powerful infrared cameras using much smaller telescopes such at the one at the Observatoire du Mont-Mégantic. The researchers also hope to learn more about the abundance of such objects in the next few years using instruments such as Nasa's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.","A gas giant planet has been found in a large orbit around a distant star .
Called GU Psc b it takes the planet 80,000 years to complete an orbit .
It is 2,000 times further from its star than Earth is from the sun .
This distance, a record among exoplanets, has allowed it to be imaged .
And it could lead to the discovery of smaller planets in tighter orbits ."
"By . James  Nye . Suicide: Former pastor Scott Sechrist took his own life on Tuesday one week before his sexual abuse trial was due to start . A former Pennsylvania pastor has killed himself one week before he was to stand trial for molesting a nine-year-old girl 25-years ago. Scott Sechrist, 61, was discovered in his Red Cedar, Levittown home on Tuesday and police confirmed that they found a note near to his body. The girl, who is now in her 30s, first reported the sexual abuse in 1992, but claimed the molestations began three years prior to that. The Levittown Now reported previously that the girl recanted the allegations in 1992 because she feared she would be taken away from her mother. Bucks County prosecutor Jennifer Schorn said Sechrist's suicide note maintained his innocence but she did not elaborate further. Sechrist had served as pastor of the First Baptist Church of Morrisville and allegedly knew the girl's family from the church. According to police, the woman told a detective that Sechrist began sexually assaulting her by grabbing her butt. He reportedly told her it was 'cute' when she was in fifth grade inside a Bristol Township home. The assaults continued during evening prayer sessions that lasted for 10 to 15 minutes. Authorities alleged Sechrist’s behavior escalated to intercourse and happened multiple times a week over the course of two years. Sechrist had served as pastor of the First Baptist Church of Morrisville and allegedly knew the girl's family from the church . She said that the behavior stopped when she was 12-years-old.

"By . James Rush . Featuring seven bedrooms, five bathrooms and hardwood floors, this Tudor-style family home could be expected to cost a packet. But the property in Detroit is in fact listed for just $1,000 as the city expands its online auction of homes in its efforts to combat the area's blight. Mayor Mike Duggan and the Detroit Land Bank Authority announced the auction website Building Detroit last month, which was designed to get homes into the hands of people who will quickly fix them. This seven bedroom Tudor-style property in Detroit is listed at just $1,000 as the city expands its online auction of homes in its efforts to combat blight . Among those currently listed for auction on the site is a stunning six bedroom 1914 Georgian Revival property, complete with leaded glass, a tile fireplace, elegant wainscoting and original woodwork . This five bedroom brick home features five bathrooms and a three-car garage. The home needs new plumbing along with new front porch steps, electrics and kitchen . The property also needs cosmetic upgrades to the floor and paint for the walls, according to the Building Detroit website . The site launched with 15 homes up for auction - but the scheme has now been expanded to include two more neighbourhoods, featuring some impressive properties. A total of 13 listings in Boston Edison, on Detroit's west side, have been added to the website, along with 10 houses in the eastside Osborn area, according to WILX 10. Five houses were bought in the auction's first week, most commanding at least $30,000 after being listed for $1,000. Among those currently listed for auction on the site is a 1929 East English Village brick home, which has three bedrooms. Elsewhere, a stunning six bedroom 1914 Georgian Revival property is available, complete with leaded glass, a tile fireplace, elegant wainscoting and original woodwork. As with many of the properties on the site, the home does require some repair work. This brick colonial, which features six bedrooms and three bathrooms, sits on a generous lot and has several fireplaces . Upgrades to the property's electrical system, plumbing and interior waterproofing is recommended however . This three-storey 1920 home features ornate woodwork and historic masonry - although the property does require a number of repairs and updates . This 1881 historical home, which has been coverted into a two-family property, needs some windows and a few doors, but offers four bedrooms and two bathrooms . Detroit has been working for years to deal with vacant and dangerous buildings, often by demolishing them. Last month, Duggan announced a program for revitalizing neighborhoods by rebuilding and refurbishing homes. Following the auction website's launch last month, officials said owners of uninhabited and dilapidated homes will be put on notice that their homes will be seized through legal action unless they begin work to fix them. Any homes that are salvageable will be auctioned. 'This is a historic change in Detroit’s strategy in fighting blight,' Duggan said in April. This three bedroom brick colonial features a natural fireplace, formal dining room and garage - there are a number of areas however which need attention, including its roof and gutters . Mayor Mike Duggan and the Detroit Land Bank Authority announced the auction website Building Detroit last month which was designed to get homes into the hands of people who will quickly fix them . 'We are getting away from this mindless process of demolishing everything that’s vacant. What’s different is we are attacking the entire neighborhood at once.' The city was planning 'an extensive marketing campaign' to drum up interest in the auction. Duggan's program is modeled after a similar project he ran as the Wayne County prosecutor from 2001 to 2003, the Detroit News reported. That initiative saw 1,000 homes fixed up.","Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan announced auction website Building Detroit last month to help fill empty properties.

"By . Alex Ward . Violent row: Leeroy Reed leaves Bridgend Court where magistrates heard he 'used all his force' to slam his ex-girlfriend's head in a car door . Reality TV star Leeroy Reed has been spared jail after he slammed his ex-girlfriend’s head in a car door. The Valleys star was ‘foaming at the mouth’ during a row with Rebecca Jones, 21, the court heard today. The 23-year-old ‘used all his force’ to shut the heavy car door of his BMW as Ms Jones stuck her head inside the car as they fought over looking after their one-year-old son. Reed also sent his former partner ‘abusive’ text messages and shouted that he hated her during an argument. Miss Jones was a passenger in Reed’s 3-series BMW along with their baby son when they began arguing. Miss Jones told the court in Bridgend, South Wales: ‘When we were driving, he was very angry. He was foaming at the mouth. ‘When we arrived at my house he was sitting in the driver’s seat and I leaned into the passenger seat to speak to him. ‘The door was just ajar and I put my head in, not all of me. ‘He leaned forward and pulled the door and it hit my head. ‘The door and the door frame hit my temples. I felt dizzy, in pain and I started to cry. I later noticed bruises.’ Magistrates heard how Reed had been looking after their little boy while Miss Jones went out for the day. The court was told Reed became annoyed when she did not return at the time he had expected. He denied assault but was found guilty at an earlier hearing after claiming self-defence. 'Foaming at the mouth': A restraining order has been imposed against Reed, who starred in reality TV show The Valleys (pictured far right with the cast), not to contact ex-girlfriend Rebecca Jones . Mel Butler, defending, said: ‘Reed’s career within the entertainment industry has been hampered - with various contracts on hold at the moment which has affected his income. ‘This appears to have been a one-off incident.’ Magistrates gave him a 12-month community order with 150 hours of unpaid work. He was ordered to pay £630 in court costs and £50 compensation to Miss Jones. A restraining order was also imposed against Reed not to contact Miss Jones directly or by phone and text. Career hampered: Defending Reed, Mel Butler said that the incident had negatively affected his career in the entertainment industry. Reed said on The Valleys that he wanted to be Wales' next big urban music star . Chair of Bridgend magistrates Roger Norfolk told Reed: ‘The lesson here is violence is not the answer.’ The court heard Reed had 13 convictions for eight previous offences including two for violence. The Valleys is a MTV reality television show in which 11 Welsh aspiring celebrities share a big house in Cardiff. In the show, Reed said he wanted to be Wales' next big urban music star.

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Associated  Press Reporter . A mysterious radiation release that has indefinitely shuttered a nuclear waste dump in New Mexico may have been caused by a change in the type of kitty litter that is mixed with the toxic waste. That's one of the theories that officials are exploring as they investigate the February 14 leak at the Waste Isolation Pilot Project in southeastern New Mexico that contaminated 21 workers with low levels of radiation. Jim Conca, a scientist who worked at the facility from 2000 to 2010, said believes a change from non-organic to organic litter caused a chemical reaction inside a waste drum, releasing the radioactive isotopes. Mystery leak: The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad, N.M., became the site of a radiation leak in February . Exposed: The radiation release contaminated 21 workers and shuttered the southeastern New Mexico facility three months ago . New Mexico Environment Department Secretary Ryan Flynn confirmed to the Carlsbad Current-Argus Monday that he has heard Department of Energy officials discuss the possibility that kitty litter may have been to blame for the radiation leak. Flynn said it is one of many theories and nothing is certain at this time. In a statement Tuesday, the DOE said only that it is investigating 'all possible scenarios.' The dump 26 miles east of Carlsbad cannot take in liquid waste, so kitty litter is used to absorb any fluids before drums of waste are sealed and shipped to the facility, Conca said. One of a kind: In this March 7, 2014 photo released the U.S. Department of Energy, specially-trained workers make unmanned tests inside the shuttered Carlsbad facility - the nation's only underground nuclear waste dump . The dump is the federal government's only permanent deep-underground repository for waste from decades of building nuclear bombs from Los Alamos National Laboratories and other federal facilities. WIPP Recovery Manager Jim Blankenhorn told a town hall meeting last week that after several trips into the half-mile-deep repository, officials believe the radiation leak was likely caused by a chemical reaction in nuclear waste that was mixed with nitrate salt. Blankenhorn said a switch from a non-organic substance to organic was what triggered the event. The unidentified substance containing elements mirroring nitrate salt is kitty litter, Conca said. The DOE on Tuesday confirmed that any waste with liquid is typically treated with 'an absorbent like kitty litter.' 'I'm just dying to know why this happened and who approved it, because it was a dumb idea,' Conca said. 'You just can't make a change to the procedure without reviewing it.' Surprise culprit: A scientist believes a change from non-organic to organic kitty litter used to absorb liquid waste caused a chemical reaction . This May 10, 2014 photo provided by the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant shows waste stacks in a storage room with broken magnesium oxide bags and heat damage, seen as black streaks on the rim of the container at center, on top of a standard waste box . Investigators have said that crews on the latest trip into the mine spotted melted plastic and rubber on some drums and boxes of waste, indicating there was some kind of heat generated in the room where the waste is stored. Nine days before the release, a truck hauling salt in the mine caught fire. But officials have said the fire was far from the waste-handling area and that the events were likely unrelated. Initial investigations into both accidents have blamed them on poor management, an eroding safety culture, ineffective maintenance and a lack of proper oversight at the 15-year-old, $5billion site. The Department of Energy's investigation, the results of which were made public late last month, found  shortcomings at almost every step, from a more than 10-hour response to the initial emergency alarm to a bypass in the filtration system that allowed the radiation to escape above ground. Sub-standard: A preliminary investigation has blamed the accident on poor management and an eroding safety culture . 'The bottom line is they failed to believe initial indications of the release,' board chairman Ted Wyka said at a town hall meeting April 23. DOE's report also found that much of the operation failed to meet standards for a nuclear facility; a lack of proper safety training and emergency planning; lagging maintenance; and a lack of strategy for things like the placement of air monitors. Problems with oversight by the Department of Energy also were cited. Bob McQuinn, who took over as head of the contractor that runs the plant shortly after the release, acknowledged mistakes by Nuclear Waste Partnership. He also detailed a series of changes in management, training and operations to ""assure that every hazard that is posed by WIPP is examined"" and proper safeguards are put in place to make the operation 'a world-class nuclear operation.'","Radioactive isotopes were released into the air at Waste Isolation Pilot Project in February .

The mentally disturbed man who smashed his way into a Baltimore TV station Tuesday live tweeted the his take-over as he watched the commotion he had caused on a TV inside the studio. Vladimir Mehul Baptiste, 27, demanded to be let into WMAR-TV and claimed he was God. When a security guard refused to open the door, he returned - this time with a dump truck he had stolen. Security camera footage from the station shows him repeatedly ramming the front doors before finally plowing straight through into the lobby. Baptiste was arrested after barricading himself inside the station for five hours. He faces numerous charges, including three counts of attempted murder. After breaking into the station, Baptiste locked himself in an editing room and began tweeting as he watched live TV news coverage of the commotion he had created outside. 'Chillin @ abc2 news waiting and yawning,' an hour and a half after the break-in. The remainder of his tweets from inside the station appear to be meaningless babble about 'energy.' 'can you all see me the days of the negative energies hurting you are OVER!' he wrote. His final tweet was: 'ALL these millenniums of petyness and ""just for Fun"" Bulls***, you will not be forgiving by me! just wait.' Scroll down for video . Raving: Baptiste can be seen in surveillance video screaming outside WMAR-TV and demanding to be let in. An employee tried to calm him down - but would not open the doors . Back with a vengeance: Baptiste left, but then returned to the TV station with a stolen dump truck and smashed it through the front doors . He rammed the doors over and over again - until he finally broke through into the lobby of WMAR headquarters . Authorities believe Baptiste was mentally disturbed. Baltimore County Police Chief Jim Johnson said was 'ranting and raving incoherently' as he was taken into custody. A WMAR-TV employee recounted the scene as Baptiste tried to get into the TV station the first time. When a secretary refused to open the doors, he pounded on the front entrance and screamed 'let me in . 'Let me in! Let me in! I'm God, I'm f***ing God!' the witness told WBAL-TV. Baptiste is the son of Haitian immigrants. Merizia Saindor Baptiste broke down when she heard what her son was accused of doing. Mrs Baptiste told WMAR-TV she and her husband moved their six children to the United States from Haiti in 1999 in an attempt to give them a better life. Baptiste can be seen here surrounded by heavily-armed SWAT officers shortly after his arrest . Rantings: Baptiste sent out several incoherent tweets from the editing room where he barricaded himself at the TV station . Smashed: This is the doorway that a man smashed his landscaping truck through at the offices of WMAR-TV outside Baltimore, Maryland, Tuesday afternoon . Smashed: This is the stolen dump truck that smashed through the lobby of Baltimore TV station WMAR-TV on Tuesday . Police say that after locking himself in a second-floor editing room in the building, he turned on a TV and watched the commotion he had just caused unfold live on local and national broadcasts. Just before 5pm, Baltimore County police officers sent a dog into the room where the man was holed up. The man was subdued so that officers could arrest him. Police had initial reports that the man was heavily armed - possibly with several guns. Heavily-armed SWAT teams quickly swarmed the area and began clearing the building. Terrified staffers fled the building through a back door. Everyone was believed to be safe and accounted for within an hour of the incident. However, four hours after the attack, SWAT officers discovered one lone staffer who had taken cover and was cut off from the rest of the employees. The TV station is on lockdown. The TV news channel, an ABC affiliate, has not been able to get on air, but that hasn't stopped the staff from tweeting about the incident. Brian Keubler, a WMAR reporter, wrote that he watched at the man ran up to the front doors of the TV station and pounded on the doors. He screamed that he was God and yelled 'Let me in!' An image from the surveillance video at WMAR-TV shows the moment the truck crashed through the lobby . Frightening: Brian Kuebler, a WMAR-TV reporter, tweeted out live updates of the harrowing incident at his station . At least three heavily-armed SWAT teams have entered the building to search for the man, who is believed to be barricaded inside . SWAT officers arrived in force after police received reports that the suspect was heavily armed . Evacuating: SWAT officers have evacuated the building of all employees, according to WMAR-TV executives. SWAT officers are still searching for the suspect . Then, he got into a landscaping truck and rammed the doors at least three times before breaking through into the building. So far, a head count in the TV station has revealed that none of the employees are missing or injured, Kuebler wrote. Helicopter video from WJZ-TV shows a hole in the front of the building, large enough for a vehicle to enter. Drivers were still able to enter a neighboring shopping center, although a section of the road was blocked to traffic. Two schools near the TV station are on lock-down as officers hunt for the suspect. A stretch of busy York Road in Towson, Maryland, a Baltimore suburb, has been closed - disrupting traffic flow in the region.

"Poachers killed 33 elephants recently in remote Congo park . Three poachers died in gun battle with rangers at weekend . Garamba National Park, Congo, a stronghold for LRA . By . Paul Donnelley . The deaths of 33 elephants in a remote park in Congo has led to speculation that the rebel Lord's Resistance Army is poaching the animals. Ten were killed last Friday in Garamba National Park, according to African Parks, a conservation group that manages the park along with Congolese authorities. Park rangers killed three poachers in a weekend gun battle in Garamba, in Congo's northeastern corner near South Sudan. Ten elephants were killed last Friday in Garamba National Park, according to African Parks, a conservation group that manages the park . ‘We have reason to believe that the major poaching thrust is emanating from the heavily forested Azande Domaine de Chasse, which has been a traditional base for the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA),’ Peter Fearnhead, the CEO of African Parks, wrote in a letter to other conservationists that the news agency Reuters obtained today. Warlord Joseph Kony, the LRA leader indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, waged a brutal guerrilla war against the Ugandan government in the north of the country for nearly twenty years before fleeing with his fighters into the jungles of central Africa around 2005. A 2013 report from human rights group Enough Project said the LRA had begun systematically killing elephants and trading poached ivory for food, weapons, ammunition and other supplies. Joseph Kony, leader of the Lord's Resistance Army, whose group may be behind the poaching of 33 elephants recently in Garamba National Park . Mr Fearnhead wrote it was not yet clear ‘whether the current poaching onslaught emanates from the LRA, Sudanese poaching gangs, local Congolese poachers, or a combination of these.’ Garamba is home to around 1,800 elephants, according to African Parks, and has been targeted by poachers in the past. Twenty-two elephants were killed and their tusks and genitals removed in a single 2012 attack suspected of being carried out by the LRA. However, the rebels' involvement in the killings was never confirmed and some harbour doubts that the LRA is behind the latest wave of poaching. ‘We hear the elephants were killed by professional poachers. That is not the LRA,’ said Rev Benoit Kinalegu, a Catholic priest who heads a network monitoring LRA attacks and movements from the town of Dungu on the edge of the Garamba park. ‘This area is so militarised it is impossible to know who it was,’ he said. A 5,000-strong African Union Regional Task Force, supported by 100 U.S. Special Forces, is hunting for Kony and his commanders, who are accused of abducting thousands of children to use as fighters in a rebel army that has earned a reputation for mutilating its victims. While Kony is believed to be hiding in a Sudanese-controlled area of a disputed enclave in South Sudan, according to the United Nations, his fighters continue to operate in an isolated zone straddling South Sudan, Congo and Central African Republic. The Lord’s Resistance Army, also known as the Lord’s Resistance Movement, is a militant religious movement, which operated in northern Uganda and South Sudan. The LRA has been accused of widespread human rights violations, including murder, abduction, mutilation, child-sex slavery, and forcing children to participate in hostilities. The LRA was originally formed to resist the Uganda People's Defence Force before it took control of the country. The UPDF has been accused of widespread murder, rape, and pillage.

A 13-year-old Colorado boy suspected of shooting his father dead and concealing the killing for days made his first court appearance Monday as prosecutors weighed whether to charge him as an adult. Kai Kelly was arrested last week on suspicion of first-degree murder in the death of his father, Joseph Kelly Jr, in the small mountain town of Gypsum, about 105 miles west of Denver.

The blaze began in the Rancho Bernardo area and was spread along the parched ground by the gusty Santa Ana winds . Officials said no homes were reported damaged in the fire. But there are still fears of more wildfires spreading across California as more record-high temperatures are predicted over the next two days . San Diego fire chief Javier Mainar said the firefighters now had a 'pretty good handle' on the wildfire . The wildfire comes after months of drought, as well as some of the highest temperatures seen in the area for more than 30 years. On Tuesday, the day the fire started, record temperatures of 94F - which is around 35C - were recorded for the first time since 1979. As the fire took hold of the area, evacuation orders were made for more than 20,000 homes, as well as several schools, on the outskirts of San Diego. Meanwhile, another 1,200 homes and business in Santa Barbara County - which is 250 miles to the north - were also evacuated due to a fire, which spread across 500 acres. Daniel Berland, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said at least six other fires in total had been reported in the state, but they were all now believed to be under control.

"By . Associated Press . and James Rush . Father Robert Cormier, of Jersey City, died after falling about 1,000ft from the top of Oregon's tallest peak, it has been reported . A Catholic priest from New Jersey died after falling about 1,000ft from the top of Oregon's tallest peak. Father Robert Cormier, 57, of Jersey City, ascended Mount Hood's south side with two others but continued alone when one of his companions suffered a leg cramp, Hood River County sheriff's spokesman Pete Hughes said. Father Cormier appeared to reach the summit before he fell near Eliot Glacier at the volcanic peak 50 miles east of Portland. A helicopter photographed the climber and his position but saw 'no signs of life,' Hughes said. The office later confirmed his death. Father Cormier, a published author of books on religion and faith, was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1982. Jim Goodness, spokesman for the Archdiocese of Newark, told MailOnline: 'He was a very dedicated priest, very passionate and compassionate. 'Most of his life as a priest, we are talking about 32 years really, he was ordained in 1982, he was involved in urban ministry settings, so he was very familiar working with people who are city residents - different ethnic groups, those on a lower economic level and immigrant populations. He was fluent in five languages.' Father Cormier's biography on his publisher's website also describes him as a pilot, mountain climber, sailor, cave explorer and scuba diver. Father Cormier appeared to reach the summit before he fell near Eliot Glacier at the volcanic peak 50 miles east of Portland . Hughes says rescuers will wait until next . week to recover Cormier, when colder temperatures would afford them . more stability on the rocks and ice. Spring is the prime season for climbing Mount Hood because the weather is better but not so warm that the ice melts and rocks fall more readily. The peak is notorious for loose rocks in warm weather. Conditions were warm in the area on Monday and Tuesday, with a reported temperature of 47F (8C) Tuesday morning on the summit. 'Climbers up there reported the snow was getting warm, and they wanted to get down and get off,' Hughes said.

Thousands of people climb the 11,240-foot peak each year. The most recent death at Mount Hood was in August. A Polish military officer visiting the United States for training with a drone manufacturer went to the summit on a day off. The most fatalities in one accident were seven students from Oregon Episcopal School and two adults who died after they dug a snow cave during a sudden storm in May 1986.","Father Robert Cormier ascended Mount Hood's south side with two others .

"By . Julian Robinson . The father of an Ohio soldier who was kidnapped in Iraq ten years ago and later killed has urged an Iraqi judge to fully prosecute the man accused of taking his son’s life. Keith Maupin, 63, of Cincinnati, took part in a video teleconference from the Pentagon in the case of a man in Iraqi custody, whom U.S. officials say confessed to the killing of Sgt. Matt Maupin. The 20-year-old soldier was kidnapped when insurgents with rocket-propelled grenades and small arms ambushed his fuel convoy near Baghdad in 2004. Closure: The Pentagon says an Iraqi has confessed to killing Matt Maupin, who was captured in 2004 . Answers: Keith Maupin, who refused to shave while his son was still missing, wants to know why Matt was killed . At the time, video of the young Maupin was released showing him sitting on the floor surrounded by masked gunmen. The soldier's family held hope he was still alive, but his remains were later found in a shallow grave near Baghdad in 2008. On Tuesday, the initial hearing in the case was closed to reporters. Mr Maupin, who refused to shave for more than four years as he waited for news of his son's fate, said he appeared by videoconference and spoke via translator to the Iraqi judge, who asked to hear statements from the family. Afterwards he said he came away from the hearing feeling confident that justice will be served. Ordeal: Shortly after Matt was captured when his fuel convoy was ambushed, a video appeared showing masked gunmen surrounding him . Ambush: Matt Maupin was taken hostage after insurgents attacked the fuel convoy he was traveling with . The judge did not indicate how he might rule or when he might rule, but that the man will be punished if found guilty, according to Mr Maupin. A week ago, Mr Maupin revealed he did not know whether he would have the chance to speak to the suspected killer – but in the end, the man in Iraqi custody was not present at the hearing. ‘I made it clear to the judge that I feel this guy needs to be held accountable under Iraqi law,’ Mr Maupin said after the hearing. ‘If Matt's death can benefit the Iraqi people by ensuring a strong justice system, it will be worth it even though he is gone.’ According to Iraqi authorities, the man is Iraqi and initially confessed to Matt Maupin's killing in 2009, when he was tried and sentenced to death. Campaign: Keith and Carolyn Maupin at a homecoming event in 2005. They founded a care package charity in memory of their son . Never forget: Matt's parents founded the Yellow Ribbon Support Center, which delivers care packages above to the forces, to help other soldiers and keep their son's memory alive . But, he is now being retried due to problems in the initial paperwork. For years Mr Maupin and ex-wife Carolyn had held on to hope that their son would be returned alive, after he was ambushed by insurgents in April 2004. His captors released a video showing the young man surrounded by armed insurgents as he sat on the ground. A few months later another video, appearing to show him being killed, was released. Finally, in March 2008, the Army contacted Sergeant Maupin's parents to say that remains had been found and that DNA analysis showed they belonged to their son. In April 2008, the family were told that two of the kidnappers had been sentenced to death, and that at least six Iraqis were believed to have been involved.

"By . Sam Webb . A ‘secret millionaire’ who lived in a council flat left his entire £1.1million life savings to a hospital charity after his death, it has emerged. Former railway worker James Redgate, of Nottingham, chose to donate the legacy to a good cause instead of friends and relatives - who have praised his generosity. Mr Redgate, who never married and had no children, appeared to live a frugal life, according to neighbours, and is thought to have built up his fortune by saving his wages and pension. He stunned staff at the Nottingham Hospitals Charity with the seven-figure donation following his death at the age of 83 in 2011. Act of kindness: James Redgate left £1.1million to a Notttingham Hospital Trust. His money bought two new state-of-the-art CT  scanners. Pictured, his sister Joan (left) and other relatives in front of one of the scanners . Mr Redgate lived . with his mother in Arnold, Nottingham, before she died of leukaemia, and . his family believe it may have been the care and treatment that she . received which prompted him to leave the cash to Nottingham Hospitals . Charity in his will. Mr Redgate also suffered from the disease. The charity has now spent the money, which totalled £1.1m, on two new CT scanners that will help thousands of patients. However, rather than feeling they have missed out on a windfall, Mr Redgate’s family have hailed his extraordinary generosity. Speaking at the unveiling of the scanners, his sister Joan said: 'I had no idea this would happen, it’s been such a surprise. 'James would have been so happy that this new scanner is going to help so many people. That’s the sort of person he was, if he could help someone he would. 'Our mum would have been very proud of him.' The ground-floor council flat of Mr Redgate. The former railways worker, who never married and had no children, is thought to have built up his fortune by saving his wages and pension. His identity was initially kept secret when the donation was first announced last year. Former neighbours of Mr Redgate, who is thought to have served in the army before working on the railways, said he seemed to live a basic life in his humble ground-floor council flat. Patricia Barber, 82, said: 'He had lived here since he was in his 70s. We used to chat over the garden fence, just passing the time of day. 'He didn’t have a car and used to go away on coach trips with his sister. He never gave any indication of being wealthy. In fact, you would say he lived quite frugally. 'He apparently never married and seems to have spent much of his life looking after his parents, especially when they were elderly. 'The only person he seemed close to was his sister. You wouldn’t say he was reclusive, he would walk to the shops most days.' James Redgate's sister Joan (left, in yellow) and other relatives at the unveiling of a plaque commemorating the act of generosity . She added: 'He loved spending time in his garden but in later years couldn’t get around much because his legs had gone. He never gave an sign of being that well-off. He was a very nice gentleman.' Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'It’s incredible, we never knew he had so much money. It’s like something out of the Secret Millionaire TV show. 'But I think what he’s done is marvellous. It’ll help so many people.' The new scanners, which are replacing older models, are faster, reduce the radiation dose to patients by a fifth, aid early diagnosis and help improve treatment. One each will be placed at Nottingham’s two major hospitals. Barbara . Cathcart, chief executive of Nottingham Hospitals Charity, said at the . time of the donation: 'He has relatives, but his life savings came to us. We knew . nothing of it. 'He . had his reasons for giving that he took to the grave, because his . family do not know why. It wasn’t malicious. He just gave it all to us.' After . the scanners were unveiled this week, Mrs Cathcart said: 'This is an . incredibly generous donation, which will help many thousands of patients . in the Nottingham area. 'We . are so grateful to James Redgate for remembering Nottingham Hospitals . Charity in his will, and would like to thank his family for joining us . at the official opening of the first of two scanners that are being . purchased in Mr Redgate’s memory.

"By . Leon Watson . Convicted murderer Robert Campbell was headed to the Texas death chamber for lethal injection as appeals courts considered arguments from attorneys . A federal appeals court has halted a convicted Texas killer's execution so his attorneys can pursue appeals arguing he's mentally impaired and ineligible for the death penalty. Robert Campbell, 41, would have been the first U.S. inmate executed since a botched execution in Oklahoma two weeks ago. He had two separate appeals, one claiming mental impairment and another that challenged the state's plan to use a drug for which it will not reveal the source, as was the case with drugs used in Oklahoma. 'I am happy. The Lord prevailed,' Campbell said from a cell just outside the death chamber in Huntsville, Texas, before being returned to death row at a prison about 45 miles to the east. The drug secrecy issue was pending before the U.S. Supreme Court when the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals halted his punishment about two and a half hours prior to his scheduled execution. Campbell was set to die for killing a Houston bank teller in 1991. 'Campbell and his attorneys have not had a fair opportunity to develop Campbell's claims of ineligibility for the death penalty,' a three-judge panel of the New Orleans-based court said. 'In light of the evidence we have been shown, we believe that Campbell must be given such an opportunity.' That appeal contended Campbell wasn't mentally competent for execution because he has a 69 IQ. Courts generally set a 70 IQ as the minimum threshold. In 2002, the Supreme Court ruled mentally impaired people cannot be executed. Campbell's attorney, Rob Owen, argued Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials failed to turn over three intelligence tests from Campbell's earlier imprisonment that bolstered his claims of mental impairment. The records had been requested 10 years ago by a previous attorney who was told they didn't exist and only recently surfaced, he said. State attorneys contended defense lawyers never asked for the records until March. The next Texas execution is scheduled for August. Missouri has an execution scheduled for May 21 that now would become the first one since the botched injection in Oklahoma. Scroll down for video . Family members of victims walk out of the Walls Unit following the execution of Angel Maturino Resendiz, in Huntsville,Texas . A gurney used for executions in Texas. Unlike Oklahoma, which uses a three-drug combination, Texas uses a single dose of pentobarbital to kill inmates . Campbell's lawyers also made an issue of the drug to be used in the execution and the source not being identified. Like Oklahoma, Texas won't say where it gets its execution drugs, saying it needs to protect the producer's identity to prevent threats by death penalty opponents. Unlike Oklahoma, which used a three-drug combination in the April 29 botched execution of Clayton Lockett, Texas uses a single dose of the sedative pentobarbital to kill inmates. During Lockett's lethal injection, the inmate's vein collapsed, prompting Oklahoma prison officials to halt the procedure. Lockett later died of a heart attack. Oklahoma has put executions on hold while an investigation is ongoing, but authorities there have suggested the trouble started with Lockett's vein rather than the drugs. Campbell's attorneys were among several arguing the incident demands greater execution drug transparency. Lockett writhed and grimaced after the lethal injection was administered, and corrections officials did not realize not all the drug had entered his body for 21 minutes. Campbell's attorneys say Lockett's failed execution proves what many inmates have argued since states turned to made-to-order drugs: that the drugs put the inmates at risk of being subjected to inhumane pain and suffering. Texas' attorneys said Campbell's claims were speculative and fall 'far short' of demonstrating a significant risk of severe pain. 'The Constitution does not require the elimination of all risk of pain,' argued Ellen Stewart-Klein, an assistant Texas attorney general. Campbell's execution would have been the eighth this year for Texas, which kills more inmates than any other state, and the fourth in recent weeks to use the compounded pentobarbital. Texas invoked confidentiality in late March when it obtained a new supply of pentobarbital to replace a stock that had reached its expiration date. The 5th Circuit late on Monday rejected an appeal on the drug secrecy issue, saying mere speculation wasn't enough to prove the claim Campbell could be subjected to unconstitutionally cruel pain if executed with drugs from Texas' unidentified provider. Campbell was convicted of capital murder for the 1991 slaying of Houston bank teller Alexandra Rendon, who was abducted while putting gas into her car, robbed, raped and shot. Rendon, 20, had been making wedding plans and was buried wearing her recently purchased wedding dress.

Legendary basketball coach Don Meyer, 69, is in hospice care in South Dakota (pictured in 2010) 'Coach Meyer is at peace, loved, enjoying his family and getting exceptional care from Avera St. Luke's. As a family, we are so proud of his perseverance, faith and strength.' Meyer retired from coaching in 2010 with a then-NCAA record 923 victories in 38 seasons at Northern State University in Aberdeen, Lipscomb University in Nashville, and Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota. In September 2008, the native of Wayne, Nebraska, was critically injured in a car accident that led to the amputation of his left leg below the knee. Doctors discovered during his treatment that he had an inoperable form of cancer. 'What's great about this is I would not have known about the cancer had I not had the wreck,' Meyer told The Associated Press at the time. Don Meyer pictured at the 2009 ESPY Awards at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles with his award . 'God has blessed with the one thing we all need, which is truth. I can now fight with all of my ability."" In August 2012, Meyer had a pacemaker implanted and three heart valves replaced due to the cancer. Meyer launched a leadership teaching tour less than a month after the surgery. ESPN awarded Meyer the Jimmy V. Award for Perseverance at the ESPY Awards in Los Angeles in 2009. He received the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame's John W. Bunn Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010 and the Naismith Outstanding Contribution to Basketball Award in 2012. Meyer was named NAIA National Coach of the Year in 1989 and 1990. He was enshrined in the NAIA Hall of Fame in 1993.","Coach Meyer's health has drastically declined over the past months .

"By . James Rush . A giant sinkhole big enough to swallow a car has appeared in the middle of a Detroit road in the latest reported case of craters opening up in the city's streets. The 10ft hole appeared over the weekend in a road in a busy neighbourhood on the west side of the city. It is at least the fourth time a sinkhole has been reported to have appeared in Detroit since January.

It caved in however over the weekend and has now been taped off. Crews were today continuing attempts to repair the hole, the Detroit Water & Sewerage Department has said. Harsh winter conditions are believed to have caused several problems for Detroit and this is at least the fourth report of a sinkhole in the city since January. Greg Eno, Detroit Water and Sewerage Department spokesman, told MailOnline it was believed the latest hole was caused by a 'failed' water pipe underneath a basin riser. He said: 'The thinking is that it was a pipe that's failed and then caused a backlog which eventually built up and it caved.' Just last month, with only moments between them, two cars found themselves trapped in the same sinkhole as Fox 2 television cameras captured the accidents.

Inside . the cavern was a criss-crossing matrix of pipes and utility lines that . worried maintenance crews rushed to secure as neighbors feared natural . gas leaks and interruptions in water service. Efforts toward repairing the hole began almost immediately, but it was feared the wider flaws in the decaying city's infrastructure meant the holes could keep appearing elsewhere. Just last month, with only moments between them, two cars found themselves trapped in the same sinkhole . Darryl Latimer with Detroit's water department told WWJ-TV that the sinkhole was discovered while crews were sending a camera through a sewer line. And in January, traffic came to a halt in downtown Detroit after a sinkhole opened in the middle of one of the city's main streets. The hole originally was about twice as big as a manhole cover but eventually opened up to measure about 14 feet by 10 feet, WWJ-AM reported.","Hole big enough to swallow a car appeared in Detroit street over weekend .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Joshua Gardner . A veteran of the war in Afghanistan who fought through concussions and shrapnel to the face in order to save a fellow soldier after an ambush by the Taliban became just the seventh living recipient of the nation's highest military honor on Tuesday. President Barack Obama gave the Medal of Honor to Kyle White in a White House ceremony befitting the courageous deed the Seattle native performed that November day in 2007 when he was just 20 years old. White fought for the lives of his comrades amidst rocket-propelled grenades, gunfire and a round of friendly mortar. He even continued to fight when he came to after an explosion knocked him unconscious 30 seconds into the battle. Scroll down for shocking video of the Taliban ambush... Honored: Seattle native Kyle J. White became just the seventh living soldier to receive the military's highest honor when Barack Obama gave him the Medal of Honor at a White House ceremony on Tuesday . Best of the best: The former active duty Army Sergeant, smiles after being awarded by President Obama the Medal of Honor for conspicuous gallantry, during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House, in Washington, DC on Tuesday . 'We pay tribute to a soldier who embodies the courage of his generation': Obama lauded White as he became the seventh living recipient to be awarded the Medal of Honor for actions in Iraq or Afghanistan . Good company: Former Army Spc. Kain Schilling, standing right, the soldier that former Army Sgt. Kyle J. White saved, and members of the second battalion, Chosen Company of the 173rd Airborne Brigade, stand at attention as they were recognized by President Barack Obama while in attendance at Tuesday's ceremony . Another honor: Former U.S. Army Specialist Kain Schilling, who was saved by White in the 2007 fight, has since made White his daughter's godfather . By the time the four-hour firefight was over, White had saved one comrade's life and helped secure the evacuation of other wounded Americans. 'We pay tribute to a soldier who embodies the courage of his generation,' Obama said. With the medal, White, who was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress syndrome after the ambush, also draws attention to the recent scrutiny confronting the Veteran's Affairs health care system and allegations of lapses in care and delays in mental health treatment. Brave: White was only 20 years old and not yet two years into his military service when the group was ambushed while pinned to a steep mountainside. He was knocked unconscious in the first seconds of the fight and came to only to continue helping his comrades . Though Obama did not mention the VA controversies specifically, he told White: 'You did your duty, and now it's time for America to do ours: after more than a decade of war, to welcome you home with the support and the benefits and opportunities that you've earned.' Following the ceremony, White, 27, said the valor belonged to all the members of his platoon that day. 'Battles are won by spirit,' he said. 'Without the team, there can be no Medal of Honor. That's why I wear this medal for my team.' An Army account of the attack says White, then a 20-year-old Army specialist, and his team of 14 U.S. troops, along with Afghan National Army soldiers, were ambushed Nov. 9, 2007, after attempting to hold a meeting with village elders in the village of Aranas in Nuristan province. After regaining consciousness from the grenade hit, White found his platoon split by the ambush. Half the team had slid down the cliff for cover. He remained atop with three dead, dying and wounded comrades. Obama described the drama to an East Room audience of service members, family and White House staff: . 'Across Afghanistan, base commanders were glued to the radios, listening as American forces fought back an ambush in the rugged mountains. One battalion commander remembered that all of Afghanistan was listening as a soldier on the ground described what was happening. 'They knew him by his call sign, Charlie-1-6-Romeo. We know it was Kyle, who at the time was just 20 years old and only 21 months into his military service.' Though suffering from concussions, White treated Schilling's injuries under the shadow of a lone tree and used one of the unit's radios to call for help. When a helicopter arrived after nightfall, White only allowed himself to be evacuated after the wounded were assisted. A shocking video posted on Live Leaks shows footage taken of the brutal ambush by the Taliban. Shocking: Video taken by the Taliban during the November 9, 2007 ambush features a narrator invoking the Qur'an as he describes why White and his fellow soldiers must die . Horrifying: The soldiers can even be seen slipping down the mountain in the video. At the time, some of the group made it out of the way of enemy fire while White and others remained pinned at the top of the mountain . A narrator invokes Allah as he describes the evil deeds of the soldiers in the footage and the 'proper reception' the men are about to receive as guests in the hostile region. The footage rolls on as gun fire and the grenade launches begin and the soldiers slide helplessly down the mountainside to which they are pinned. Left at the top with White were platoon . leader 1st Lt. Matthew C. Ferrara, Spc. Kain Schilling, Marine Sgt. Phillip A. Bocks, who was imbedded with the group, and its interpreter. White set about trying to assess the condition of his fellow soldiers, . running and crawling through gunfire only to find Ferrara dead and Bocks . badly wounded. Though he tried to stop Bocks' bleeding, the Marine . later died. Schilling attended White's Medal of Honor ceremony. White retired from the Army in 2011 as a sergeant. He graduated from the University of North Carolina-Charlotte with a finance degree, and he now works as an investment analyst at a bank in Charlotte. 'Kyle will tell you that the transition to civilian life and dealing with the post-traumatic stress hasn't always been easy,' Obama said. 'More than six years later, he can still see the images and hear the sounds of that battle. Every day, he wakes up thinking about his battle buddies.' Later, White said he and Schilling wear identical bracelets. 'On it are the names of my six fallen brothers,' he said. 'They are my heroes.' 'The first thing that they need to do is reach out and get the help that they need': White himself suffers from post-traumatic stress and has recognized the need for those like him to connect and get help .","President Barack Obama gave gave the Medal of Honor to 27-year-old Kyle White at a White House ceremony on Tuesday .

"By . Associated Press . Three college friends of the Boston Marathon bombing suspect will be tried separately, but those trials do not need to be moved out of Massachusetts, a federal judge ruled Tuesday. Judge Douglas Woodlock ruled that Azamat Tazhayakov will stand trial on June 30, followed by Dias Kadyrbayev on September 8 and Robel Phillipos on September 29. Their lawyers had asked the federal judge to move the trial out of state, saying that overwhelming media coverage of the case would mean that their clients won't receive fair trials in Massachusetts. This courtroom sketch shows defendants Azamat Tazhayakov, left, Dias Kadyrbayev, center, and Robel Phillipos, right, college friends of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, during a hearing in federal court today . Robel Phillipos (center), a friend of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev who is charged with lying to investigators, arrives for a hearing in his case at the federal courthouse in Boston today . Woodlock said the defendants could receive fair trials in Boston, or if need be, in Springfield, 80 miles west of Boston. He pointed to the trial of Boston mobster James 'Whitey' Bulger, which was held in Boston despite the case's high profile. Prosecutors opposed the venue change but didn't object to severing the trials. Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov are Kazakhstan nationals who are charged with tampering with evidence for removing Tsarnaev's laptop and a backpack containing fireworks from his college dorm room shortly after last year's fatal bombing. Kadyrbayev also faces conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges. He and Tazhayakov have been held without bail for more than a year. Phillipos, of Cambridge, is charged with lying to investigators. He has been held under house arrest. The Kazakhs, who have been held in . federal custody on immigration violations since their arrest days after . the attack, were allowed to appear in court in dress shirts and . trousers, rather than prison jumpsuits. Phillipos, who is out on bail, . arrived in a light gray business suit and tie. Each pleaded not guilty. All three sat quietly in the courtroom as Tuesday's hearing began. Their lawyers have also asked the judge to strike references to 'terrorism' from the charges, noting prosecutors have not contended that the three played any role in the bombing attack.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, now 20, is awaiting . trial on charges linked to the bombing and faces the threat of execution . if he is convicted. His older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, . died in a gun battle with police three days after the attack as the . siblings attempted to escape the city. He and his older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, allegedly placed two pressure cooker bombs near the marathon finish line. Three days later, Tamerlan was killed in a gunbattle with police, the same night Massachusetts Institute of Technology security officer Sean Collier was shot and killed. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is facing state charges in Collier's death. Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in Tsarnaev's trial, which is set to begin in November. Defense lawyers for the three friends also filed motions to suppress some evidence, which Woodlock did not immediately rule on. Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov face charges of conspiracy and obstruction of justice, which carry a penalty of up to 25 years in prison. Phillipos faces a less serious charge of lying to investigators, which carries a possible 16-year sentence.

"By . Associated Press . The number of possible victims of a teacher suspected of drugging and molesting boys during a four-decade career at schools around the world has risen sharply, with the FBI saying hundreds of people have contacted it about the case. Calling William Vahey one of the most prolific pedophiles in memory, the FBI had said that the teacher molested at least 90 boys whose photos were found on a memory drive stolen by his maid in Nicaragua. But Special Agent Shauna Dunlap yesterday said the bureau has now 'been contacted by several hundred individuals from around the globe wishing either to reach out as potential victims or provide information in the ongoing investigation.' The FBI said last month that William Vahey (pictured) had molested at least 90 boys, whose photos were found on a memory drive stolen by his maid . Dunlap said officials wanted as many people as possible to call or contact the FBI through its website in order to receive counseling and provide information about Vahey, who killed himself at the age of 64 after evidence of molestation was found on a memory drive stolen by a maid in Nicaragua. He was one of the most beloved teachers in the world of international schools that serve the children of diplomats, well-off Americans and local elites. The discovery of his molestation has set off a crisis in the community of international schools, where parents are being told their children may have been victims, and administrators are scurrying to close loopholes exposed by Vahey's abuses. Apparently, not even Vahey's victims knew they had been molested. The double-cream Oreos that he handed out at bedtime on school trips were laced with sleeping pills — enough to leave the boys unconscious as he touched them and posed them for nude photographs. There were decades of missed opportunities to expose Vahey, starting with an early California sex-abuse conviction that didn't prevent him taking a series of jobs exposing him to children. In 1969, Vahey was arrested on child . sexual abuse charges after police said he pinched the penises of eight . boys, ages 7 to 9, at an Orange County, California, high school where he . taught swimming. Vahey, then 20, told authorities he had started . touching boys without their consent at age 14. Vahey taught at the Southbank International School in central London from 2009 to 2013 . A security guard stands at the entrance of Jakarta International School (JIS) compound in Jakarta, Indonesia, where Vahey taught from 1992 to 2002 . He pleaded guilty to a single charge of lewd and lascivious behavior. He received a 90-day jail sentence and five years' probation, but he was allowed to leave the country in January 1972. Vahey began his international teaching career at the American School in Tehran, the first in a series of stays around the Middle East and Europe. He taught history, social studies and related subjects in Lebanon, Spain, Iran, Greece, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, almost always to middle school students. By the time he arrived in Saudi Arabia, Vahey was married and had two sons with Jean Vahey, a widely respected administrator. In addition to teaching, he coached basketball and led school trips to Bahrain, Turkey and Africa. Authorities may have missed a warning sign during a later teaching stint in Venezuela: Two students under Vahey's care were rushed to a hospital after falling unconscious in their hotel room on a trip, parents and staff said. Officials were unable to determine why and chalked it up to a possible failing air conditioner. Seven years later, the Vaheys went to . work at the Westminster campus of London's Southbank International . School, with about 350 pupils from 70 countries. Police say at least 60 . of the 90 or so children in the images on the USB drive were from that . school. The house where Vahey lived, near the American Nicaraguan School in Managua, where he worked as a teacher from 2013 to 2014 . Vahey began his international teaching career at the American School in Tehran, the first in a series of stays around the Middle East and Europe. He taught in Lebanon, Spain, Iran, Greece, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, almost always to middle school students . Southbank's chair of governors, Chris Woodhead, told Britain's Press Association there had been one complaint against Vahey, but, 'The boy's parents agreed that there was nothing untoward and the matter shouldn't be pursued,' Woodhead said. In early March, the maid who had taken the memory drive handed it to American Nicaraguan school director Gloria Doll, who found it contained photos of unconscious boys, many between the ages of 12 and 14, often being touched by Vahey. Doll confronted Vahey, who told her, according to an FBI affidavit, that he had given the boys sleeping pills, adding: 'I was molested as a boy, that is why I do this. I have been doing this my whole life.' Vahey said he had swallowed more than 100 sleeping pills in November after discovering the USB drive had been taken. In early March, the maid who had taken the memory drive handed it to American Nicaraguan school director Gloria Doll, who found it contained photos of unconscious boys, many between the ages of 12 and 14, often being touched by Vahey . Doll demanded Vahey's resignation, according to the affidavit, and notified authorities at the U.S. Embassy in Managua the next day, U.S. officials said. Embassy officials immediately notified Nicaraguan police, but Vahey had already flown out of the country. Vahey traveled to Luverne, Minnesota, where relatives live. He checked into a hotel and stabbed himself in the chest with a knife, leaving a note apologizing to his family. The discovery has led to reviews of recruiting policies, background checks and security procedures at organizations of schools around the world. Jane Larsson, executive director of the Council of International Schools, said a group of six international education associations was examining to close loopholes allowing pedophiles to move from country to country without being detected by background checks or other reports. 'When this kind of thing happens it's a shock to everyone and it mobilizes action,' she said.","FBI last month said teacher William Vahey had molested at least 90 boys .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . Michael Sam, the first openly gay football player to be drafted into the NFL received a warm welcome as he arrived in St Louis, Missouri on Monday to start training with the Rams. The draft turned Sam into an instant celebrity across the U.S. and especially within the LGBT community. At his first Rams press conference on Tuesday, Sam reacted to hearing a story about a son who was able to finally come out to his father after being inspired by the football player's story. 'I'm honored that I helped someone be comfortable with who they are, gave him a little courage to deal with his father. I'm honored to have that happen to his son,' Sam said. Scroll down for video . 'I guess it's great': Michael Sam spoke about being the first openly-gay man drafted into the NFL at his first press conference with the St Louis Rams on Tuesday . 'But right now I'm just looking . forward to continuing on my dream. If it inspires other people, hey, I'm . with you. Anyone that's not OK with that, if someone disowns you, be a . part of my family. I welcome you. Ram up!' Sam, a graduated of the University of Missouri, was selected in the seventh round of the draft and celebrated on live TV by kissing his boyfriend Vito Cammisano. A father posted the heartwarming tale of his son's coming out on the university's Facebook page after. The man says he was watching the draft with his son and other family members, who are mostly military veterans. 'When Michael Sam was finally drafted my 15 year old son started crying and told me he was gay. He said he didn't want to hide anymore or be embarrassed about who he was. Thank you Mizzou for embracing Mr. Sam and recruiting a young man of his caliber so that kids like my son have more positive role models to look to...' The call: Both Sam and his boyfriend Vito Cammisano cried tears of joy as they received the good news . At the press conference on Tuesday, Sam said he was thankful to have been drafted, especially just to a team located just two hours from his alma mater. 'St Louis feels just like home,' he said. 'I still [don't] really feel like I’m part of the NFL right now. I'm . blessed.' When asked what it felt like to be the first gay man hired in the NFL, Sam said: 'I guess it's great.' He apperaed with five other late-round draft picks for the press conference on Tuesday. After about 20 minutes, the other players left and Sam answered questions solo. He says he hopes his landmark drafting will let other people know 'It's OK to be who you are.' 'Whether you're gay, straight, black or white. It's OK to be comfortable in your own skin,' he said. An honor: Sam said he was blessed to be in the NFL. Pictured above at the Tuesday press  conference with Rams coach Jeff Fisher . Landmark moment: Sam says he hopes his drafting proves that it's 'OK to be who you are'. Sam has a long road ahead of him if he wants to make the Rams' 53-man roster by football season. The Rams are already pretty well-stacked for the position he used to play at Missouri, so he'll have to focus on learning another role. But he believes the attention he's received is only going to help him play better. 'Thank God for you guys making this all a big deal, because it’s just going to make me a better player than I am now,' Sam said. 'I'm determined to be great so I'm going to train hard and try and make the team,' he added. There were fears that Sam would be the target of homophobia if drafted, and Miami Dophins player Don Jones was even fined for tweeting 'HORRIBLE' after Sam was selected. But the Rams have so far been a tolerant team for Sam. 'They came to me, actually,' he said. '""Welcome to the family, let’s get to work,"" and that’s what we’re going to do.'

And if he is targeted for his sexual orientation, Sam says he'll focus his energies on the game. 'I have every confidence in myself that I will make this team,' Sam said. 'So when I do make it and when I put my pads on, if someone wants to say something, then you'll see No. 96 running down the field and making big plays for this team.' But the conference took a dark turn when one of the reporters asked if he had spoken to his father, who told the New York Times that he would be opposed to his grandchildren being raised by gay parents. 'I have not had a one-on-one conversation with my father,' Sam answered bluntly. He did not elaborate. Sam arrived in St Louis on Monday after spending the weekend in Las Vegas celebrating the draft with his boyfriend. At the Las Vegas airport, Sam was greeted with applause as he boarded his flight for St Louis. 'He had a nice big round of applause from everybody.  They were congratulating him and welcoming him to St. Louis.  It was really impressive to see,' passenger Jason Hall told KTVI.

"By . Steph Cockroft . A 15-month-old baby has survived falling from an 11th floor balcony, after he narrowly missed hitting a pavement and instead landed on a soft bed of soil. Toddler Musa Dayib is now in a critical but stable condition after falling from the high-rise Riverside Plaza Apartments in Minneapolis, U.S, where he lived with his family. The boy suffered serious injuries and is said to be in a critical but stable condition at Hennepin County Medical Center, where his parents continue to keep a bedside vigil. Musa Dayib, who is 15 months old, is in a critical but stable condition after falling from the 11th floor of the high-rise Riverside Plaza Apartments in Minneapolis, U.S, where he lived with his family . But neighbours are amazed that the boy - who was said to be conscious when he was found at the bottom of the high-rise building - survived the shocking fall. The toddler avoided hitting a pavement more than 100 feet below and a steal box by inches, in what one doctor described as 'a gift from God'. Dr Tina Slusher from the pediatric intensive care unit the hospital said: 'If you and I fell that far, we would be dead.' The tragedy unfolded after the baby's . father Guled Ahmed quickly went to the kitchen while he was playing with . his two children, according to the Star Tribune. Less than one minute later, his three-year-old . daughter ran into the kitchen saying: 'the baby fell'. Sahra . Dayib, Mr Ahmed’s sister, said her brother looked over the balcony . railing and saw Musa lying on the ground 11 storeys below. He grabbed his daughter and ran down the stairs to reach his son - who was conscious and crying - as quickly as possible. Dr Slusher said: 'He’s a baby and he happened to land on a very small patch of mulchy area. Musa Dayib, 15 months, miraculously survived after falling 11 floors from his family's balcony at the Riverside Plaza Apartments in Minneapolis, U.S . Neighbours are amazed the boy - who was said to be conscious when he was found at the bottom of the high-rise building - survived the shocking fall from the 11th floor balcony, pictured . 'He’s a kid so they tend to be more flexible and pliable than you and I would be. Having said that, it’s a real gift from God that he made it because this is a huge fall.' Neighbour Abdirizak Bihi said he and his daughters were out . for a walk Sunday night when they saw the commotion outside the building. When news spread about the toddler’s horrific fall, neighbours gathered to see what they could do to help the little boy. Musa was then taken to hospital, where he was treated for his injuries, including concussion, bruising to the lung and fractures in his ribs, backbone and arms. Mr Bihi said: 'When people found out he survived, no one could believe it. 'I’m more concerned about his dad and his mother. They’re devastated. They can’t even speak. 'It took place in less than a minute. The grandmother told me that the daughter opened the balcony door. This is such a tragedy. The parents are blaming themselves.' Bihi said the Somali-American community is trying to help the mother and father to focus on the miraculous survival of their son. Neighbours also pledged to set up a fund for the family, as they come to terms with the horrific incident. In a statement released by hospital . officials, the parents said they were thankful for the 'continued . prayers for Musa and his family at this time'. After the incident, owners of the Riverside Plaza apartments met with community members to talk about measures to stop small children opening the patio doors. Neighbour Larry Ross described how the young boy was crying and had narrowly missed the pavement and a large steel box of housing electric equipment. Mr Ahmed's brother Abdirahim Ahmed - who said the lock on the family's patio door was broken - also told the meeting that his brother was 'terrified' but was a 'good dad'. He said: 'We’re just praying that he’s OK.' The toddler is said to be in a critical but stable condition after the fall, which happened while the young boy was playing in the apartment with his sister and father . Matt Lindstrom, a spokesman for the city, said the balconies at Riverside Plaza exceed the state's requirements. George Sherman, whose family owns and manages the complex, said new patio doors, screens and locks were added to the high-rise buildings during a recent $65 million renovation. On request, the building’s managers provide wood blocks that can be placed in the patio door’s track to prevent the door from being opened, he added.

"By . Associated Press . Caught: The man who called himself Waylon Wilson (pictured) has been arrested and identified as Dallas Smallwood . A man accused of escaping from a South Carolina jail nearly 40 years ago has been captured in western Michigan living under a different name. Dallas Smallwood, 58, was arrested Monday in Zeeland, 25 miles southwest of Grand Rapids. Smallwood is accused of escaping from a jail in 1977 in Anderson County, South Carolina, while serving a five-year sentence for grand larceny and receiving stolen goods. Smallwood escaped from the jail in Stockage on October 3, 1977 just months into his sentence. The suspect, who works as a trucker, . was living under the name Waylon Wilson but using his actual birth date, . the U.S. Marshals Service said. 'He would not admit who he was until we fingerprinted him at the jail,' Deputy U.S. Marshal Steve Hetherington said. He said Smallwood may have been in western Michigan for a decade. Smallwood had no criminal record in the state. 'We believe he had a girlfriend who didn't have any idea about his past,' Hetherington said. Back in the day: Dallas Smallwood was arrested for grand larceny in South Carolina in 1977 and escaped prison just months after being put behind bars . Spreading out: The search for Smallwood was revived a year ago and database searches crossreferenced with surveillance footage led investigators to Michigan . Michigan Live reports that a task force of deputy marshals and state police were able to use database checks that were cross-referenced with surveillance footage to show that Smallwood and Wilson were one in the same. He was arrested without incident on Monday but he would not confirm his true identity until he was forced to give a fingerprint at the police station which matched his old records. Smallwood is in custody at the Ottawa County jail, awaiting extradition to South Carolina. Marshals have been looking for Smallwood for about a year in a wide-ranging search that included Texas and Kentucky. Hetherington said he didn't know what information led investigators to Michigan.","Dallas Smallwood was arrested in South Carolina for grand larceny in 1977 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The man suing X-Men director Brian Singer for raping him as a teen claimed he had never actually been to Hawaii - where many of his explosive allegations took place - in a separate 2003 lawsuit that was unearthed today. Michael Egan, now-31, stated under oath that he had never left the continental United States in part of a deposition, obtained by Buzzfeed, that was taken for a previous lawsuit after the rapes allegedly took place. The news casts doubt over his horrific claims last month that Singer and others drugged and raped him during a series of sordid pool parties in Encino, California, but mainly in a seven-bedroom estate in Kailua, outside Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1999. Conflicting information: Michael Egan, pictured April 21, 2014, stated under oath that he had never left the continental United States in a deposition, unearthed by Buzzfeed, that was taken for a previous lawsuit after the rapes allegedly happened . In the 11-year-old deposition, Egan directly contradicts much of his own case through his sworn statement that he'd never at that point left the mainland U.S. with the defendants. Buzzfeed obtained six pages of the 84-page deposition. In those pages, Egan responds to a question about his travel, saying he'd 'never had any trips outside the continental U.S., no.' He then specially refers to Hawaii, clarifying that another person did go to the state. 'I'm . not sure how he interpreted the continental United States,' Egan's . lawyer, Jeff Herman, told Buzzfeed of the remarks in the deposition. 'I'm not sure what he's talking about specifically here.' Alleged rapist: The news casts doubt over his horrific claims last month that Bryan Singer, pictured, and others drugged and raped him during a series of sordid pool parties in Encino, California, but mainly in a seven-bedroom estate in Kailua, outside Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1999 . Herman . said Egan's mother, Bonnie Mound, confirmed the trips to him, telling . him she'd authorized either Marc Collins-Rector or Chad Shackley to take . her young son to Hawaii at least twice. And Egan also confirmed them, Herman said. However, in the deposition, Egan explained that he'd never traveled outside the continental U.S. because his mother would not let him. Collins-Rector or Chad Shackley plus . another man, Brock Pierce, were being sued in the previous lawsuit by . not just Egan but four other co-plaintiffs. The case, which played out in Los Angeles County court, targeted the internet entrepreneurs, who were allegedly the ringleaders in the abuse of young, aspiring male actors. In the deposition, Egan was asked if he ever took any trips with the defendants, to which he responds that he did, to places like Las Vegas and Lake Havasu. But he said he didn't not travel outside the continental U.S. though someone, likely another victim who's name is redacted from the deposition, did. Asked where, he responds 'From what I recollect, I believe he went to Hawaii.' When he's asked why the other boy went and he didn't, he said his mom would never allow him to anywhere within any far amount of distance, like Mexico, any of those' and would 'pretty much lock the door' when he asked. Last month's lawsuit also claims Singer 'forcibly sodomized Egan' in the Encino mansion, an allegation not undermined by the newly publicized deposition. However, the Hawaii allegations are vital to the latest case as Egan was able to file suit in the state because of an extended statute of limitations for older cases such as his. He filed April 16, 2014, just days before the April 24 cut off. Scene of the crime? Egan was allegedly taken on two trips to Hawaii with Singer where they stayed at the Paul Mitchell resort, entrance pictured above. However, those claims are now in question . Meanwhile, . another alleged victim, an unnamed British teenager, filed a lawsuit . early this month alleging that the Hollywood heavyweight sexually . assaulted him. Now aged 25, the man accuses Singer of sexually abusing him when he was 17 at a London hotel along with Broadway producer Gary Goddard. This second blow came after the X-Men director called the rape accusations made against him 'a sick twisted shake down' and announced he would be missing press appearances for his upcoming movie in light of the allegations. Singer's attorney did not comment to Buzzfeed in regard to the latest news.","Michael Egan stated under oath that he'd never left the continental U.S. in a 2003 deposition for a previous lawsuit after the rapes allegedly happened .

"By . James  Nye . The family of a late Wizard of Oz actor who played a Munchkin in the classic film appeared in St. Louis court on Monday to claim $500,000 back from his former caretaker. Mickey Carroll's family claim that the hypopituitary dwarf, who died in May 2009 aged 89, was exploited by carer Linda Dodge just before his death. His nieces and nephews first launched the civil suit in 2011 after discovering that their uncle, who never married or had children, had lost significant assets from his fortune. Iconic role: Mickey Carroll picture here in 2008 (left) one year before he died holding the famous ruby slippers from The Wizard of Oz and (right) in 2007 when he received a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame along with six other ex-Munchkins from the 1939 movie . Recognition:  (from left to right) Mickey Carroll, Clarence Swensen, Jerry Maren, Karl Slover, Ruth.. 'The Munchkins' Receiving a Star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame, Los Angeles, on 20 November, 2007 . 'Linda Dodge wormed her way into the life of Mickey Carroll and started to isolate him from other family members,' said the family’s attorney, Patrick McCarthy, in opening statements according to St. Louis today. However, Dodge's defense team said that she was the only one who cared for Carroll as his Alzheimer's advanced and brought him to doctor's appointments and even moved him into her home before he died. 'Ms. Dodge genuinely cared for the decedent,' said one of her attorneys, Christopher Blaesing. 'She treated him like family.' He said the simple explanation for the extravagant spending exhibited by Carroll was because of his generosity. 'He was a small man but he was larger than life when it came to his spending.' The suit accuses Dodge of getting Carroll, who stood just over three-feet tall and was 18 when he appeared in 1939's The Wizard of OZ, to grant them power of attorney over his affairs. Carroll's neices and nephew's allege that Dodge, her daughter Wendy Oldham and her husband, George W. Anderson got the munchkin actor to take out a $100,000 line of credit from a bank on his St. Louis house. Iconic: Mickey Carroll (to Judy Garland's left hand in the green with pocket watch) appears in the 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz . His family claimed that prior to this he was frugal and had no debts. Indeed, five days after taking out his bank loan on January 22, 2009 bank records show that he began to sign checks made out to cash, with the first being for $42, 836. Then two days after that he signed a check for $27,000 to cash and that same day, another one for $27,000. Dodge, in an interview with the Post-Dispatch shortly after Carroll died on May 7, 2009, called allegations of missing money 'foolish.' She said she became Carroll's caretaker in January 2009. The suit says that 'at a minimum,' a total of $225,071 was embezzled from Carroll's account at Regions Bank. Carroll's niece, Josephine Romeiser said her uncle was successful as a gravestone and monument maker after his Hollywood career ended. 'If you look up the word entertainer, that was my Uncle Mickey,' she said, according to St. Louis Today. Carroll was one of more than 100 adults and children who were recruited to play the movie natives of what author L. Frank Baum called Munchkin Country in his 1900 book 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.' Carroll told The Associated Press in a 2007 interview that the Munchkins made only $125 a week while filming the movie that would become a classic. 'The Wizard of Oz' was Carroll's only movie. When it appeared on television in the 1960s, he found a new career at charitable events, retail events and Oz-related events. Mickey Carroll in the 'Wizard of Oz' (captioned on the pictured) Carroll was 18 when he appeared in the 1939 movie . 'It's not me; it's the movie,' Carroll said. 'When they see me, they think of their childhood, and it makes them smile.' Carroll was born Michael Finocchiaro on July 8, 1919, in St. Louis. The son of immigrants, he grew up in an Italian neighborhood on the city's north side with a twin sister and four older siblings. All preceded him in death. A pituitary condition caused Carroll's short stature. Stephen Cox, a friend of Carroll's and the author of a book on the Munchkins, told the St.Louis Post-Dispatch that Carroll was 4-foot-3 when he stopped growing in his 40s. Carroll danced at the Muny Theater in St. Louis when he was in grade school, he once said, and in the 1920s worked in Chicago clubs and on the Orpheum Theater vaudeville circuit. His gift of gab and comedic timing helped his popularity. He warmed up crowds for President Franklin Roosevelt while campaigning in New York City and served as a crowd-getter in President Harry Truman's whistlestop campaign. He did Phillip Morris live radio ads and appeared in shows with Mae West. He later did radio shows with George Burns, Gracie Allen, Jack Benny and Al Jolson. Mickey Carroll.: One of the last surviving Munchkins from the 'Wizard of Oz' at home in St Louis, Missouri, America in September 2008 . But it was his role as one of the 'Oz' Munchkins that defined him. Carroll played the part of the Munchkinland 'Town Crier,' marched as a 'Munchkin Soldier' and was the candy-striped 'Fiddler' who escorted the movie's wide-eyed orphan, Dorothy Gale, played by Judy Garland, down the yellow brick road toward Emerald City. In the mid-1940s, Carroll returned to St. Louis to run the family business making cemetery monuments. After he sold it in 1996, he filled his time with charity work, Dodge said. In November 2007, Carroll and six other surviving Munchkins received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Carroll was joined on that occasion by former Munchkin colleagues Ruth Duccini, Jerry Maren, Margaret Pellegrini, Meinhardt Raabe, Karl Slover and Clarence Swensen. Swensen died in February. At a special screening of the film in 2005 in Los Angeles, Carroll said talking to longtime fans about the movie brought back their childhoods. 'They have tears,' he said. 'I'll say, 'May the magic of Oz always be with you.' And, 'Follow the yellow brick road!' And they're all excited. I bring back their childhood. Ain't that something?'","Family of Mickey Carroll claim the actor was extorted of $500,000 by his caretaker in the last days of his life .

"By . Associated Press . The Mississippi martial arts instructor who tried to frame an Elvis impersonator of sending ricin-laced letters to the President has tried to change his original guilty plea by saying that he wants a chance to prove his innocence. James Everett Dutschke pleaded guilty in January to sending the tainted letters to Obama as well as Republican Senator Roger Wicker and Mississippi judge Sadie Holland. He was set to be sentenced Tuesday in Aberdeen, Mississippi but when he was in court, he told U.S. District Judge Sharion Aycock that he is innocent and wanted a chance to prove it. Changing stories: James Everett Dutschke argued today that FBI agents and federal prosecutors committed perjury, specifically regarding his DNA allegedly found on a dust mask (pictured today) Dutschke argued FBI agents and federal . prosecutors committed perjury, specifically regarding his DNA allegedly . found on a dust mask. Dutschke said he was making a harmless organic fertilizer not poisonous ricin. He . was so confident that the substance was harmless that he offered . prosecutors a 'free shot' by letting him eat the remaining substance . that's in evidence. 'I will . dump the contents of the two remaining letters on a peanut butter . sandwich and eat it and wash it down with a glass of chocolate milk,' Dutschke said. Chad Lamar, the chief federal prosecution in the case, said there was not perjury. 'The . defendant is simply mistaken,' Mr Lamar told Judge Aycock. Hoping for freedom: James Everett Dutschke originally entered a guilty plea for sending ricin-laced letters to the President and other officials but said in his sentencing on Tuesday that he wants to change that (pictured in April 2013) 'The mask he threw in . the coffee grinder box was the mask that tested positive.' Aycock did not rule immediately, saying she would look at arguments from the defense and prosecution. 'Your filing the motion to withdraw does not necessarily mean the court will grant it,' Judge Aycock told Dutschke. 'I do want you to understand that your withdrawal is in the discretion of the court.' She said she will likely hold a hearing before ruling on Dutschke's request. The ricin case drew national attention not only because of the threat to the President but also because of the internal small-town dynamics at play in the subsequent investigation. Rivals: Dutschke, a martial arts instructor (left), tried framing his longtime enemy Paul Kevin Curtis (right), an Elvis impersonator, of sending the letters last spring . Prosecutors in that case said Dutschke was trying to frame Paul Kevin Curtis, a longtime enemy and Elvis impersonator, who was briefly jailed before Dutschke was jailed in his place. The ricin charges are separate from three cases where he admitted to inappropriately touching three young girls who were students at his martial arts studio in Tupelo, Mississippi. Today's court appearance and his attempt to change his plea in connection to the ricin plot is not expected to have an effect on his admission of guilt for fondling three girls, who were 8- to 10-years-old when the incidents occurred from 2007 to 2013.","James Everett Dutschke originally entered a guilty plea for the ricin-sending case but has now asked to change it .

"By . James  Nye . Charged: Marckenson Chery is facing a minimum of ten-years in prison for allegedly participating in Skype sex sessions with a 15-year-old girl . A 28-year-old Fort Lauderdale man appeared in court on Monday facing up to 10-years in prison after a 15-year-old girl's father discovered alleged cyber-sex sessions between the pair. Marckenson Chery, who turns 29 this week, is accused of several online sex sessions with the San Francisco teenager during which he convinced the alleged victim to masturbate, show herself naked and then watch while he masturbated. The teen told Chery, whose Skype name is 'Swag likeus Robinson', that she was 15 and investigators claim that she reminded him this several times during the two months they were online. Federal agents from Homeland Security say that the California teen met Chery online in September using the anonymous online chatting site called Omegle. They then moved their relationship to video messaging service Skype and when the girl's father became suspicious in November he took her phone and discovered 143 pages of sexually explicit chat between the two. He handed this over to San Francisco police who then contacted Homeland Security Investigations agents in South Florida. Appearing in federal court in Fort Lauderdale on Monday, Chery pleaded not guilty to one charge of enticement of a minor. Skype: The popular video messaging system was allegedly used by the teenager and Chery for sex sessions . His attorney, Joshua Fisher, said he did not want to comment on the allegations until he has properly reviewed the evidence. If convicted, Chery faces between 10-years to life in prison and a $250,000 fine. Joe Trias the deputy special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in South Florida said that criminals use many different apps to make sexual contact with children and teens. 'We are seeing an increase in these kinds of cases, though I'd be hesitant to call it a trend,' Trias said in a phone interview with the Sun Sentinel on Monday. 'There's such a huge variety of apps … the criminal element is always going to find ways to use them for their own purposes.' He warned parents to be vigilant with the social their children are using. 'The way one of our agents puts it is: 'Do you want a 30-year-old man in your child's bedroom at 1 a.m.?' Trias said.","Fort Lauderdale resident, Marckenson Chery, 29, is charged with months of internet sex sessions with a 15-year-old San Francisco girl .

"By . David Gardner In Los Angeles . While most schoolchildren are finishing off their exams and looking forward to the summer break, Haris Suleman will be taking off with his father on an incredible journey to fly their single-engine plane around the world in just 30 days. If they succeed, 17-year-old Haris - who has been flying with his father, Babar, since he was eight - will be the youngest ever to accomplish this daredevil feat. But it’s not just personal goals that the Sulemans, from Plainfield, Indiana, are striving for. When they begin their journey next month they will also be raising money to help educate Pakistan’s poorest of the poor – the children living in some of the world’s worst slums. A veteran at 17: Haris Suleman has been flying with his father since he was a toddler, and next month will embark on a round-the-world trip, with Haris the lead pilot . The father-son team will take flight in a single-engine plane that they are familiar with and say they have taken all the necessary precautions in preparing . Dad Babar Suleman is an experienced pilot and said he only plans to take over the controls from his son Haris in the event of an emergency . The charity Babar and Haris are supporting – The Citizens Foundation – is this week celebrating the opening of its 1,000th school. Since TCF’s inception in 1995, the non-profit organization headquartered in Karachi, Pakistan, has built purpose-made primary and secondary schools in the nation’s most in-need communities with the proviso that every attempt is made to have an equal number of boys to girls in the classrooms and the teaching staff is all female. Depending on the weather, Babar and Haris plan to set off from Indianapolis in June. - Greenwood, Indiana - Goose Bay, Canada (9 hours flight time) - Goose Bay, Canada - Reykjavik, Iceland (9 hours) - Reykjavik, Iceland - Biggin Hill (London) - England (7 hours-Oil Change) - Biggin Hill (London) - England - Crete, Greece  (9 hours) - Crete, Greece - October, Egypt (4 hours) - October, Egypt - Aswan, Egypt (3 hours) - Aswan, Egypt - Al Ain, UAE (9.5 hours-Oil Change) - Al Ain, UAE - Karachi, Pakistan (4.5 hours) - Karachi, Pakistan - Sargodha, Pakistan (3 hours) - Sargodha, Pakistan - Islamabad, Pakistan (2 hours) - Islamabad, Pakistan - Lahore, Pakistan (1 hour) - Lahore, Pakistan - Nagpur, India (7 hours) - Nagpur, India - Bangkok, Thailand (6 hours) - Bangkok, Thailand - Bali, Indonesia (9 hours) - Bali, Indonesia - Darwin, Australia (8 hours - Oil Change) - Darwin, Australia - Cairns, Australia (4.5 hours) - Cairns, Australia - Nadi, Fiji (10 hours) - Nadi, fiji - Pago Pago, American Samoa (9 hours) - Pago Pago, American Samoa - Kiribati (Christmas Island) (8 hours) - Kiribati (Christmas Island) - Kona, Hawaii (8 hours - Oil Change) - Kona, Hawaii - Sacramento, California (13 hours) - Sacramento, California - Greenwood, Indiana (9 hours) Their trip will include stops in Canada, Iceland, England, Greece, Egypt, Pakistan, Indonesia, Australia, Fiji, American Samoa, Kiribati, Hawaii and California. Using the latest technology, anyone interested will be able to follow the exact flight path of the plane and watch their progress from videos mounted on the outside of the aircraft. 'I am really looking forward to getting going,' said Haris, a junior at Plainfield High School. 'I only just got my license but I can’t imagine a better way to spend my summer.' 'He will be the pilot in command,' added Babar. 'I will only take over the controls in an emergency situation. If all goes well, my son will be going back to school for his senior year with some tall tales to tell. 'He has been flying with me since he was 8-years-old. He couldn’t see above the windshield in those days but he would keep the three instruments in line.' Last September, Australian teenager Ryan Campbell, 19, became the youngest person to fly a single-engine aircraft solo around the world, pipping the Guinness World Record set by 21-year-old Jack Wiegand three months earlier. Their journeys took 70 days and 58 days respectively. ‘Haris is not going solo, so he is in a different category,’ said his father. ‘But no 17-year-old pilot in command has ever done this so far, so he gets to hold that record. ‘The second record is the attempt to do it in 30 days, depending on the weather.’ The intrepid pair have taken every precaution to be ready for any emergency, even going on a sea survival course to learn what to do in the event they have to ditch in the ocean. Babar knows all too well that when you’re flying a plane, things don’t always go to plan. He survived an emergency landing after his plane developed engine trouble during a flight in 2008. 'I had to land on a highway when my engine gave out,' he said. 'My idea this time is that I am planning for an actual ditching. Then if nothing goes wrong it’s a bonus!' About 60% of the trip will be over huge expanses of water, including the Atlantic, the Pacific and parts of the Indian Ocean. They will also be passing over the Swiss Alps, the Arabian Desert and the tropical forests of Southeast Asia. The longest stretch - from Hawaii to California – will take about 13 hours. Today, TCF runs 1,000 schools with . 145,000 students across Pakistan. Every teacher, every principal, is a . woman. Every classroom strives to hold as many girls as boys. The . organization’s founders hope that with the help of supporters like the .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Pittsburgh Zoo has found a unique way to keep its mammoth African elephants in line when a human being can't do the job, and that's a pair of 25-pound Australian cattle dogs. Major and Zeta are the zoo's secret weapon, giving staff an important safety buffer when dealing with the giant animals. 'It . was a safety issue initially around some dangerous animals and the dogs . just kind of fit right into there,' Willie Theisen, the elephant . manager at the Pittsburgh Zoo, told reporters. 'They were an extra piece to the puzzle . and helped out immensely.' At the Pittsburgh Zoo, dogs Major and Zeta have made a name for themselves by becoming great elephant herders . Keeping the mammoth African elephants can be dangerous business without a safety zone like the one the dog's provide, said zoo officials . As the dogs are bred to move livestock, herding the elephants comes naturally to them. 'If you are dealing with say a dangerous animal, it kind of gives you . that added advantage (to know), 'The elephant's not so focused on me,'' Theisen told CBS News. 'Now, the elephants have to watch that dog to see what . they are going to do, so that they are going to become actually more . responsive to me.' So respected are the brave canines that the elephants will perk up if they even hear a handler call one of their names. With the dogs in the enclosure, elephants won't come within 25 yards of their keeper . They also become alerted upon hearing the dog's licenses jingle as they run around a corner. Yet Theisen said the dogs are much more than simply a pair of aggressive guards, meeting children visiting the zoo with warm and loving welcomes. 'These dogs . are actually love dogs. They would be would be great family dogs because . when they are not working, they will go out, interact with the public. They love just being petted, and I mean, they are in heaven,' he said. When they aren't herding elephants, the dogs love playing with children visiting the zoo . The practice of using dogs to herd zoo animals remains so rare Pittsburgh is the only facility in the Northern Hemisphere to use them. 'Other . than the institute in Canada, I think we are one of the very few zoos . that actually use them around the elephants,' Theisen said. But Major and Zeta have been so successful other zoos are now visiting just to watch them work. The dogs provide important safety. In 2002, keeper Mike Gatti was killed by a female elephant at the Pittsburgh zoo. Without the dogs present, CBS cameras captured the elephants walking over to Theisen to nuzzle him with their trunks. Besides providing security, the dogs help the elephants exercise. A baby elephant even rolled onto her back on the ground alongside him. Without safety precautions elephants commonly attack people and killed on man at the Pittsburgh Zoo in 2002 . But when he walked in with the dogs, the elephants would give him a distance of at least 25 to 30 yards. Unless Thiesen commanded the dogs to stay and walked away from them, he could not walk up close to the elephants. 'It's . kind of like having a second set of eyes,' he said. 'Again, by . watching the elephants, you can see they (the elephants) are more keyed . on the dogs than they are on us.'","Major and Zeta keep the elephants at a safe distance when their keeper visits .
The sweet canines love playing with children visiting the zoo .

Father-of-two Jay Watson, 42, from Illinois, has been collecting cans as a hobby for just three years but in that relatively short space of time he has stacked up a staggering 4,000 drinks cans. Mr Watson's massive collection has taken over all cupboards and wardrobes in his home and basement and is now spilling into his garage. Jay Watson with some of his staggering 4,000 strong collection of cans . But although his hobby may seem a fizzy drink fan's dream, Mr Watson hasn't actually drunk a single drop of his collection. Mr Watson doesn't enjoy fizzy drinks and he would prefer to drink water. So when Mr Watson gets a new can, he actually pours the contents away. He will then carefully rinse and save the can. 'I am passionate about my can collection but the funny thing is, I don't ever drink soft drinks,' he said. 'I do feel bad when I pour the drink down the drain, but I have to if I really want the can. I will have the occasional juice or iced tea if it comes in a can, but I usually just prefer water.' The audio technician loves to collect cans from across America and around the world and his collection started with a Pepsi can, which had sat on the top of a water cooler at his work place for several years. In the relatively short space of time Mr Watson has stacked up a staggering 4,000 drinks cans . Father-of-two Jay Watson, 42, from Illinois, has been collecting cans as a hobby for just three years . Mr Watson detests fizzy drinks and he would prefer to drink water . Mr Watson said: 'Someone bought it from a vending machine but found it had a small hole in it, so was placed on top of the water cooler where it stayed for years.' He has spent more than $1,600 collecting on his drinks collection, which includes cans from 30 different countries. In his collection Mr Watson has a Pepsi can from 1983 as well Tizer and Sparking Lemonade cans from the UK. His oldest can has been preserved since 1965 and is an American orange drink called Nehi. Mr Watson also has one blank, unopened can which came in a box of cans he ordered off the internet. Mr Watson said: 'It is great as a novelty piece as I haven't got a clue what is inside.' As he only drinks water he will sometimes get his two children involved with his hobby. A can of the Scottish drink Tizer from Jay Watson's collection . In his collection Mr Watson has this Pepsi can from 1983 . A can of sparkling Vimto, a fruit flavoured drink. This one appears to have Arabic writing on it . Mr Watson said: 'Fizzy drinks are a treat for the kids. And when they do have it it's usually without caffeine as they have enough energy as it is. 'One of our favourite things to do is to 'taste test' a new beverage, whether it's soda, tea, juice, whatever. I have a few cans in the pantry now that are awaiting a taste test before they move into the collection. Mr Watson said when he started collected he never thought he would gather so many cans, with his original target set at just 500 cans.

Mr Watson said: 'The collection began with just a few cans. I soon started collection all sizes, 8oz, 12oz, 16oz, 24oz, 32oz, whatever I could get a hold of. 'And I couldn't limit myself to just older steel cans or just newer aluminium, so I collect both. It looked like I would never find a limit.' The only rule he has is that he doesn't collect beer cans. Mr Watson's oldest can has been preserved since 1965 and is an American orange drink called Nehi . Mr Watson said: 'I would collect any size beverage can made of any material with any style opening mechanism - as long as it didn't contain alcohol.' He said: 'I don't drink alcohol and I had to draw the line with my collection somewhere, so call of my cans are non-alcoholic beverages.' 'I've bought 1,432 cans off eBay, 1,265 cans from trades or from other collectors. As far as energy drinks go, I like the design of Monster Energy cans. 'The design of the regular flavours are kind of boring, but their speciality flavours usually have really neat cans. 'And any Halloween-themed can gets moved to the top of my favourites list as well. 'In one of the can lots I bought, there was a blank, silver can. It's a sealed can complete with pull ring still intact, but there's no printing on the can at all. It's interesting because I have no idea what it could be.' Mr Watson has no plans to stop collecting and often asks friends and relatives to look out for old or unusual cans which he doesn't already have. He said: 'I love this hobby and I am always keen to get my hands on new pieces to add to the collection.'","Jay Watson, 42, has been collecting cans for just three years .

Lezley Picton, 52, ballooned to 16 stone after indulging in high-fat convenience snacks she would pick up on her way home form the stables including sausage rolls, crisps and full-fat cola. But she began to worry about injuring her 15 hands high Welsh cob Maddy after she noticed the seven-year-old horse getting short of breath while she rode her. Weight loss: Lezley Picton, 52, with her horse Maddie (l) and in June 2013 before shedding the pounds (r) Lezley, who shed five stone in just 10 months, at her stables in Shrewsbury, Shropshire . The mother-of-one, from Eaton Mascott, Shropshire, joined her local Slimming World group and in just 10 months lost five-and-a-half stone and shrank eight dress sizes. She now weighs 10.5 stone - going from a size 26 to a svelte size 10. Lezley, who lives with her partner Claire, 53, is now back in the saddle. She said: 'I have always struggled with my weight. Horses are meant to be able to carry a big weight but as a responsible horse owner I did feel sorry for them carrying me. 'It wasn't much fun for me either because I was uncomfortable and I struggled to put my wellies and jodhpurs over my calves.' Lesley once ripped her jodhpurs and was shocked to find the next two sizes up didn't fit her when she went shopping for a replacement pair. 'Miserable': Lezley in 2011 and 2012, when she weighed 16 stone - she said she is happier since losing weight . 'Being overweight had made me so miserable, I had to do something about it, and the jodhpurs episode was the final straw. I just found picking up something snacky was much easier than cooking from scratch. 'You're on our way home and the crisps and sausage rolls at the petrol station just look so inviting. 'I tried . loads of those fad diets, I was a real yo-yo dieter, you know the ones . where you don't eat and then lost a load of weight before putting it all . back on. 'I was so miserable, I was just a horrible person to live with. 'My friend suggested I accompany her to her Slimming World, I was nervous but I shouldn't have been, the members were so welcoming that I felt at home right away. 'I was worried that I wouldn't be able to eat all my favourite foods but with food optimising I was amazed at what I could eat. 'I still eat bread, fish and chips, curries and chocolate - I've just changed the way I eat and how I cook. Back in the saddle: Lezley still eats bread, chips, curries and chocolate but has changed how she cooks . Breakfast - Cereal . Lunch - Sausage roll, crisps, sandwich . Dinner - Restaurant curry or sausage roll . Snacks - Crisps, pasty . Breakfast - Cereal or fruit . Lunch - Sandwich . Dinner - Homemade curry . Snacks - None .

'I can't . thank Claire enough, she is an absolute rock to me, she came onto the . diet with me eating the same things despite the fact that she didn't . need to lose weight. 'I just feel so much better now.' Lezley has now trained as a consultant for Slimming World and has taken over her own group. She added: 'Obesity is becoming such a huge issue across the UK. 'When I first joined Slimming World as a member, I never dreamed that I would end up helping other people to lose weight but now I just can't wait to get started. 'It's a privilege for me to be able to pass on the experience, insight and understanding that helped me, so that I can give my members the support they need to get to target.'","Lezley Picton, 52, weighed 16 stone and indulged in high-fat snacks .

"By . Ted Thornhill . It was the wackiest police chase anyone can remember - armed officers in the Chinese capital Beijing pursuing a runaway ostrich. The flight-less bird – which in short bursts can reach 45mph - set the pace when he escaped from a farm and hit the asphalt running. ‘He was fast and he was big,’ said onlooker Chou Mai-an. ‘People stuck in traffic had to look twice when they saw it come up alongside them and cyclists had to swerve to get out of its way.’ Scroll down for video . Winging it: The ostrich was snapped running at speed besides traffic in China's capital, Beijing . The big bird, which is twice as fast as a road runner, got police headquarters in a flap, with several traffic patrol cars having to be diverted to monitor its progress through the city, because of fears it would distract drivers and cause an accident. A police spokesman said: ‘We checked with the main zoo and it hadn't escaped from there so we are assuming it was either someone's private pet or broke out of an ostrich farm - there are several around. They are reared for their meat and eggs. ‘The bird was not violent but its beak is capable of blinding a human if it chose to attack, and its feet can do severe damage as well. Eventually we managed to overpower it with the help of a bird expert.’ Bird of a feather: The ostrich was eventually caught by armed police and an expert handler and taken to an animal shelter . The hunt is now on to reunite the bird with its rightful owner. It is being cared for in a Beijing animal shelter until they can be traced. The ostrich is the world’s largest bird and its long legs help it to achieve its remarkable top speed.Its stride can stretch to between 10 and 16 feet. Although it can only reach 45mph for short periods, it can run for long distances at around 30mph. Last year CCTV footage (above) emerged of an ostrich on the loose in Zhangzhou city in China, with the bird caught dashing at speed at night between cars and motorbikes. A few seconds into the clip it is struck by a car - but it gets up after a few moments and runs off.","An ostrich got Beijing residents in a flap when it ran amok in the city .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . A powerful new ad series shows mothers nursing their babies in bathroom stalls, in a bid to change negative attitudes towards breastfeeding in public. The posters - which ask 'would you eat here?' - were created by University of North Texas design students Kris Haro and Johnathan Wenske as part of a college project. The duo state on their website, When Nurture Calls, that they wanted to show 'mothers who have been harassed to the point where they feel they have no other option but to nurture their baby in the restroom as to not offend anyone.' Behind closed doors: A new ad series shows mothers feeding their babies in bathroom stalls in a bid to change negative attitudes towards breastfeeding in public . The posters are captioned: 'bon appetit', 'table for two' and 'private dining', presenting a strong contrast with the distressed looks on the women’s faces. Small print at the bottom of each ad reads: 'Would you eat here?’ It continues: 'By law, breastfeeding mothers are not protected from harassment and refusal of service in public, often forcing them to feed in secluded spaces such as public bathrooms. 'Contact your state and/or local representative to voice your support for breastfeeding mothers, because a baby should never be nurtured where nature calls.' Tackling undiscussed issues: The posters were created by University of North Texas design students Kris Haro and Johnathan Wenske as part of a college project . Miss Haro and Mr Wenske encourage people on their website to support the HB 1706 bill, which legally protects women from harassment when they breastfeed in public places such as movie theaters or restaurants. It was originally introduced in 2013 by Texas House Representative, Jessica Farrar, but has since been dismissed . 'I breastfeed my beautiful . daughter wherever I am, however I always feel on edge that . someone is going to have a go' Ms Farrar states that the lifelong benefits of breastfeeding include improved cognitive development and reduced risk factors for childhood obesity, asthma, celiac disease, post-neonatal death, and certain cancers. The HB 1706 bill is now expected to be reintroduced in January 2015, and Miss Haro and Mr Wenske say the purpose of their campaign is to keep support and momentum going. Since launching their initiative on Monday their Facebook page, When Nurture Calls, has attracted more than 1,000 ‘likes’. Many women have praised them for highlighting an 'undiscussed' issue. Spreading the word: The adverts were created in a bid to break the taboo of breastfeeding in public and many mothers have praised the initiative . One fan wrote: 'I am breastfeeding my beautiful daughter and I do this wherever I am, however I always feel on edge that someone is going to have a go. It would not stop me doing it as I refuse to feed my child in a toilet. Thank you for doing this. Breastfeeding is the most natural thing in the world.' Another added: 'I am so glad you are bringing attention to this. In addition to breastfeeding in bathrooms and cars, I (as a teacher) had to pump in the co-ed faculty high school bathroom between classes.' Miss Haro and Mr Wenske have also designed an app as part of their Breast Friends project, which will allow mothers to search for places that support breastfeeding and have a friendly attitude towards it. Forty-five states and the District of Columbia have laws that specifically give women the right to nurse in public. However, in many cases, the legislation would not allow a mother to take legal action against a person who harasses or discriminates against her.",The ads were created by University of North Texas design students Kris Haro and Johnathan Wenske as part of a college project .

VIDEO Scroll down for Holland coach Louis van Gaal names World Cup squad . Talks: Ryan Giggs was pictured in Holland for a meeting with Louis van Gaal on Wednesday . Showdown: Giggs was to meet with Van Gaal for crunch talks over his Manchester United future . Meeting point: Noordwijk's Hotel van Oranje was the destination of choice for the pair . Incoming: Van Gaal is expected to be announced as the new United boss this week . Van Gaal could be announced as David Moyes' successor as early as this week, when the club will then reveal who will join the 62-year-old on the . coaching staff. With Phil Neville and goalkeeping coach Chris Woods on the way out and Nicky Butt, and perhaps Paul Scholes, expected to head back to coach the club’s Under 18s, it is Giggs’ future that remains shrouded in doubt. Van Gaal was expected to hand Giggs a coaching role at the meeting. However, whether or not he decides to stay will depend on whether he thinks the role he is offered is senior enough. He has already indicated privately that he will not stick around if he thinks he is not going to be a fundamental part of the set-up. Van Gaal is currently in the thick of preparing the Dutch team for a friendly with Ecuador on Saturday and the World Cup in Brazil next month. However, Holland's players enjoyed a day off on Wednesday, enabling the coach to meet Giggs and Woodward to discuss the way forward. Switch: Van Gaal announced his Holland team will play a 5-3-2 at the World Cup in Brazil . He revealed a shock change in tactics, from the traditional Dutch 4-3-3 to a seemingly more defensive 5-3-2, at a press conference in Hoenderloo on Tuesday — but refused to say much about United. ‘That is for Manchester United to comment on,’ he said. ‘No, I would not say anything about it. I am here for the Dutch team, not as coach of Manchester United. You’ll have to wait until the process is finished or (put) questions to Manchester United — or perhaps to another club. I cannot say anything further.’ Different directions: Phil Neville (left) will be cut from the coaching staff, though he hasn't been told formally, while Paul Scholes will have a meeting on Thursday to discuss his future role at the club .

Indeed, Generation Z exhibits a tendency to use stove tops instead of microwaves for preparing meals. This is in contrast to Gen X consumers (considered as everyone between the ages of 38 and 48), who are more focused on convenience and therefore more likely to prepare microwaveable foods. In fact, the rising generation tends to spend more time in general in the kitchen, meaning home-made breakfasts like omelets and French toast are set to overtake packaged cereals and oatmeal. Trends: Also forecast to increase are the consumption of savory snacks and 'better-for-you' snack foods like dried fruit and granola bars, as well as sandwiches and breakfasts that require some cooking . Involved: Darren Seifer, NPD food and beverage industry analyst, says Gen Z 'wants to have a hand in the production of the food so that when it hits the plate they can say that they were part of the project' Darren Seifer, NPD food and beverage industry analyst, pointed out on his blog that it may seem counter-intuitive that the younger generation - which is typically time-pressed - is spending more time in the kitchen. But he explains the logic behind it, writing: 'There seems to be a need to have their say or approval on the final product. 'It's almost as if they want to have a hand in the production of the food so that when it hits the plate they can say that they were part of the project.' Changing habits: Fresh food consumption is expected to increase more than 11per cent in the next five years, and the consumption of convenient microwaveable meals will decrease . He added that younger consumers are increasingly using additives - i.e. putting fruits or syrups on their foods - for the same reason, to feel more involved in the overall process. Judging by growing food trends, having what is typically considered a side dish as a main meal is another eating habit that will continue to become more popular. And with Hispanics making up a large percentage of Millennials as well as Gen Z, the NPD group expects the consumption of Latino foods to grow by seven per cent in the next five years.","The youngest generation of consumers is known as Generation Z, and consists of everyone up to the age of 23 .

"By . Daniel Mills . A Victorian man who blew himself up during a five-hour siege with police was wearing a homemade bomb vest but did not intentionally trigger it, a court has heard. Counsel assisting the coroner Jessica Wilby said on Wednesday that Glenn Saunders, 48, had explosives strapped to a vest he was wearing during the tense stand-off with police outside his home. But a separate explosion inside the house, five hours after the siege began, startled the former mechanic, who moved his arms in the air detonating the pull-chord device. Accidentally blown-up: A Victorian court has heard that explosives enthusiast Glenn Sanders may have blown himself up by accident during a five hour seige with police . Devastation: Glenn Sanders house was also blown to pieces during the seige with police. The 48-year-old may have accidentally tripped a chord to a bomb vest he was wearing . She also said Mr Sanders may not have had any intention of harming police, who arrived at the property about 6.45pm on April 11 to arrest him for a separate matter. The siege lasted until the early hours of April 12 before the explosives killed Mr Sanders. Police are still awaiting an autopsy report to be completed, and a further briefing document will be provided to Coroner John Olle by September 6. A decision will then be made on whether to hold an inquest into the death. Meanwhile, residents of the town have previously said how Mr Sanders' life began to spiral out of control after the death of his wife 18 months ago. They called his sanity into question, saying he was was known to walk around with explosives strapped to his chest for no apparent reason. But despite his troubled past and questionable sanity, a Derrinallum resident told the Herald Sun he would be missed.

Vidic, who is leaving United after more than eight years to join Inter Milan, has confirmed that the players fell out as their season lurched from one disappointment to another. 'We argued amongst ourselves,' admitted the United captain in an interview with the Daily Telegraph. 'This year more than any other, because when you have bad times, people show they care. We are still friends, but we were arguing to get better. We wanted to improve. 'We could say those things to each other because we have been together for so long, but it hurt.

"By . Wills Robinson . Diplomatic Protection Officer James Addison, 37, used Whatsapp to send 'disgusting' images to colleagues while on duty . A police constable who worked at Downing Street during the Plebgate scandal has been spared jail after he admitted sending colleagues extreme porn while on duty. Diplomatic Protection Officer James Addison, 37, distributed the 'disgusting and offensive images' to fellow officers from his mobile phone using Whatsapp. The court heard the elite policeman believed he was passing on the disturbing content 'as a joke'. But he was arrested after detectives discovered the sickening images during an investigation into his unit as part of Operation Alice, a probe into the controversy which led to Tory MP Andrew Mitchell's resignation. Westminster Crown Court heard the pictures included bizarre sex acts and scenes showing defecation. He was fined £6,000 and told the images go 'way beyond what is legal in this country.' Wearing a black suit and tie and yellow shirt, he hugged tearful relatives as he left the courtroom a free man, although he is likely to lose his job. District Judge Howard Riddle told Addison: 'Even at a time when the state has retreated to a huge extent in sexual judgment and taste and humour, these images go some way beyond what is legal in this country. 'These images are very unusual indeed.' Sparing the officer a jail sentence, the judge added: 'The situation would be very different indeed if this involved children and similarly if there had been involvement of animals. 'I sentence you on the basis that there were no obviously unwilling participants in the films. 'Perhaps the greatest harm is that at least some of these images were received and sent while you were working and while you were being paid by the public to carry out a very important task on behalf of the public.' The judge also accepted that the images had been sent to 'shock and amuse' rather than for profit and that Addison had not been involved in making them. 'I fall short of saying that you are not worthy of wearing a police uniform, that is for somebody else to decide,' he said. The court heard that Addison is facing an internal misconduct investigation and remains suspended. He pleaded guilty to 11 counts of publishing an obscene article under the Obscene Publications Act last month. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard the elite police officer sent pictures and video clips that included 'bizarre' sex acts. Detectives then found the content during a probe into the Plebgate scandal . Prosecutor Emma Scheer said officers on the Plebgate investigation found that Addison sent 'images of an extreme pornographic nature and some of an obscene nature'. In total, 15 people received images from him, all of them police officers, between February and June last year. 'Some were sent whilst he was on duty and on some occasions they were sent to multiple recipients at the same time,' she told the court. 'In terms of the images, some were likely to result in the infliction of serious harm to at least one of those involved and others featured defecation.' Defending, James Hines said that the images had been sent as a joke rather than for sexual gratification. Mr Hines said of his client: 'He hasn’t lost his job but he undoubtedly will do so, there is no doubt about that. District Judge Howard Riddle told Addison that the content he sent went 'some way beyond what is legal in this country'. He was fined £6,000 and faces losing his job . 'He is a man of previous good character - a good, solid, hard-working officer and family man,' he said. In total 14 officers have been subject to criminal investigation over possession of and distribution of obscene images on mobile phones. Four officers from the Diplomatic Protection Group (DPG), including Addison, were arrested but only he was charged. No further action was taken against the other three in relation to the criminal allegations but they have been the subject of a misconduct probe with eight other officers from the DPG, and two officers based in boroughs. The images were found on Addison's computer during the investigation into Plebgate, but he was not implicated in the scandal. Former Chief Whip and Tory MP Andrew Mitchell stepped down after the Plebgate affair . Former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell resigned after he was accused of launching a foul-mouthed rant at officers guarding Downing Street. The row ignited when Mr Mitchell was accused of the calling them 'plebs' during the outburst on September 19, 2012. The images Addison sent were discovered during the exhaustive £250,000 internal investigation into the controversial affair, known as Operation Alice. Forensic analysis of phones and computers were part of the lengthy probe. Every officer in the Diplomatic Protection Group (DPG) was questioned. Some 30 detectives took statements from all 800 officers in the elite unit as part of the inquiry.

Their alleged victim blotted out her three-year ordeal for almost four decades before a torrent of suppressed memories resurfaced, a court was told. Carolee Hickman, 64, is accused of preying on the Bridgend schoolgirl, convincing her she was a witch in a powerful coven linked to devil worship. Her terrified victim allegedly returned to Hickman’s home again and again, where she was regularly sexually abused. Hickman gave the girl and a number of her friends 'pagan crosses' to wear and plied them with cigarettes and alcohol, it is claimed. Husband Albert Hickman, 65, allegedly raped the schoolgirl during an encounter set up by his wife. Hickman was with the RAF based at St Athan during the period in question. A jury at Cardiff Crown Court watched a DVD recording of an interview the couple’s alleged victim made for the police. A bearded Hickman listened in silence. His wife sat in court in a mobility scooter. He denies a single charge of rape. His wife denies three counts of indecent assault and one of aiding and abetting rape. All charges relate to a period between September 1972 and September 1975. The jury has been told the couple have already been jailed in the past after being found guilty of indecently assaulting children. Their alleged victim, now aged 52, said in interview that she began visiting the couple with other friends aged 11. Charged: A bearded Hickman listened in silence in court while his wife sat in a mobility scooter . She said Hickman later claimed she was a witch, talked about the occult, used black magic and did readings with tarot cards. She said the older woman used a bejewelled knife wrapped in black silk, and kept in a wooden box, to cut the girl’s thumb and suck the blood. 'She got us believing in Satan and that she was this powerful person,' said the alleged victim, who cannot be identified for legal reasons. 'She used to tell me that I was hers, I was special. 'She told me that in the night she was going to come and get me and take me to her coven and they would fetch the devil and I would be part of the circle. 'Being so young I was gullible and believed her.' The court heard repressed memories of her schoolgirl abuse allegedly resurfaced during bereavement counselling after the death of a son.

"By . Hugo Gye . Pope Francis would be willing to baptise Martians if they came to Earth and asked to become Catholics, he said yesterday. During his daily mass, the leader of the Roman Catholic church said that no one should be denied entry into the church for any reason. He joked that even if space aliens were 'green men, with a long nose and big ears, like children draw', they deserved to be baptised if they wanted. Welcoming: Pope Francis, pictured at an ordination ceremony for new priests, says aliens deserve baptism . 'If tomorrow, for example, an expedition of Martians arrives and some of them come to us... and if one of them says, ""Me, I want to be baptised!"", what would happen?', Francis said, according to AFP. He added that the early church had an officer charged with welcoming people in to the building, but 'it was never the ministry of the closed door'. The Pope's comments came as he discussed the passage of the Bible in which St Peter is criticised for baptising non-Jews into the Christian church. However, they are likely to be seen as a coded jab at Francis' conservative critics who may have objected to his policy of openness towards poor and marginalised groups. In January, the Pope courted controversy by baptising the child of an unmarried couple in the Sistine Chapel. Embrace: The Pope insisted he would welcome visitors from Mars if they sought to be baptised . Ceremony: Francis ordained 13 priests during a service at the Vatican Basilica yesterday . Francis' joke about baptising aliens is not the first time that the Catholic church has intervened in the debate over the possibility of extraterrestrial life. In 2010, Vatican scientist Guy Consolmagno said that although he did not expect to find life on other planets, aliens would be welcome to join the church. 'God is bigger than just humanity,' he said. 'God is also the god of angels. 'Any entity - no matter how many tentacles, it has has a soul.' Track record: The Vatican has its own observatory, pictured, and has long been a leader in astronomy . And in 2008, the official Vatican newspaper published an article by an astronomer titled 'Aliens Are My Brother', in which an astronomer insisted that it was not irreligious to search for extraterrestrial life. The Vatican has its own observatory, with one telescope situated outside Rome and another in Arizona. The church's interest in astronomy began as a way of calculating the calendar and determining the date of Easter. Throughout the 20th century, the Vatican became a pioneering force in astronomical research, and photographs of never-before-seen astronomical phenomena were first captured at the papal observatory.","Francis told audience at mass that he would baptise 'green men with a long nose and big ears' if they wanted it .

"By . Sam Webb . A police force faced with slashing its budget is dealing with some victims of crime over the phone in a bid to save money. Lancashire Police now no longer deploys Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) resources to routine vehicle crime and routine criminal damage. And it has changed the way it deals with lost property, minor thefts and non-domestic burglaries - speaking to some victims of crime over the phone instead of in person. Police Federation bosses say they fear changes to how police handle crime could dent the public’s confidence in the force. Lancashire Police now no longer deploys Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) resources to routine vehicle crime. Other crimes may now also be dealt with over the phone. File picture . Federation chairman Rachel Baines said: 'Quite often there’s a whole section of society whose only contact with the police is when they are a victim of minor crime. 'You can’t take 700 police officers out and carry on doing what you did before. It’s the thin end of the wedge. It’s not just about public safety, it’s public confidence. 'The officers want to provide the same level of service but they can’t. It’s government policy, the chief constable has got no option but to reduce the budget. 'The cuts have got to come from somewhere. The cuts are starting to show, they are only just being felt.' Attendance to non-domestic burglaries and minor theft is now 'dependent on a number of factors' and the force says 'victims are spoken with and the action that is appropriate to be taken given the circumstances is explained by officers'. Attendance to non-domestic burglaries and minor theft is now 'dependent on a number of factors', the force said. File picture . The police say the approach supports 'meeting the challenges presented by shrinking budgets' but say they know people ‘wish to report incidents and crime in a way that suits them such as online or over the telephone.' The force has already identified £60m of the required savings, and have already taken £40m out of the budget, with a further £20m being taken out in this financial year. It still needs to find about £19m to meet the savings target by 2017/2018. Paul Hansen, 35, from Preston, Lancashire, was left angry and frustrated after he contacted police when his moped was stolen and after recovering the vehicle himself was told the police couldn't send a CSI team out because of budget cuts. The moped, which Mr Hansen was restoring, was stolen from outside his house and after reporting it to the police he found it himself, smashed up by the canal. Mr Hansen said the vehicle was 'blatantly covered in fingerprints'. He said he had no complaints about the officer he dealt with but slammed the fact the police wouldn't come out as 'pathetic'. The father-of-one said: 'As somebody that pays taxes we are supposed to have faith in the police. 'Somebody can steal a motor vehicle or cause criminal damage and the police are not interested.' A Lancashire Police spokesman said: 'Due to the Comprehensive Spending Review and subsequent restructure of the force, CSI staff and resources have reduced. 'As a consequence, it is necessary to prioritise the nature of work in line with risk and threat. 'Therefore Chief Officers made the difficult decision not to deploy CSI resources to routine vehicle crime, effective from April 1, 2014.' Lancashire Police now no longer deploys . Crime Scene Investigation resources to: . - Routine vehicle crime . - Routine criminal damage . Some victims of crime will be deal with over the phone instead of in person if the crime is: . - Lost property . - Minor thefts . - Non-domestic burglaries . Assistant Chief Constable Mark Bates explained: 'Every report of crime to Lancashire Constabulary is scrutinised by a police officer and a decision is made on the most appropriate course of action. 'This action could range from the immediate attendance of an officer, through to a telephone-based investigation. 'The police officer will decide on the most appropriate level of investigation by considering what information is available, by assessing the threat, risk and vulnerability of the victim and considering the ‘solvability’ of the crime. 'Not all reports of crime receive a police attendance, in fact some people prefer to be dealt with quickly over the telephone, but regardless of the crime ""type"" they all go through this initial process of investigation. 'I would like to point out that we have not stopped dealing with non-domestic burglaries and minor thefts. 'However, the way we deal with them has changed. As with all crimes. we assess each of these types of incidents that come into us and from that. 'We decide whether there is a realistic chance or being able to solve the crime with the evidence available.' Lancashire’s Police and Crime Commissioner, Clive Grunshaw said while it is 'no secret' that the force has 'diminishing resources' the way 'people wish to deal with the police is changing.' He added: 'Forensic evidence is not always available, and this has to be taken into account when decisions are taken around officer deployment. 'As part of my ongoing scrutiny of the Chief Constable, I am committed to ensuring decisions taken around deployment do not adversely impact on the trust, confidence and satisfaction levels of residents with Lancashire police.'","Lancashire Police doesn't send forensics officers to certain offences .

"By . Sam Webb . A woman plied underage boys with alcohol and allowed them to smoke cannabis in her home to groom them for sex, a court heard. Chantelle Goatley  of Newbury, Berkshire, allegedly slept with one teenager and molested a second after permitting illegal drinking and drug sessions at her house. The boys she invited into her home were 14 to 15 years of age at the time, it was said. Jurors heard of messages exchanged on Facebook between her and one of the boys . The 36-year-old denies five charges relating to events between January and April last year. Jurors heard of messages exchanged on Facebook between her and one of the boys. In it she asked him if he regretted anything, and whether he could ‘remember it all’. Two days later a message from her account to his informed him: 'You’ve got 18 bottles of Stella and loads of weed to have. xx.' Minutes later she added: 'Vodka, weed, me. What more could you ask for?' The second boy told police that on one occasion, after he drank and smoked so much as to lose all memory of events, he awoke to find Goatley next to him and she asked him: 'How was the b*** j**?' When she started rubbing his thigh he got up and went downstairs. Prosecutor Matthew Walsh said: 'They were still children and she knew their ages.' Chantelle Goatley allegedly slept with one . teenager and molested a second after permitting illegal drinking and . drug sessions at her house . 'The address she was living at became a popular place for these boys to spend their time, particularly at weekends. 'There was alcohol ready for them to drink, which she bought. There was cannabis there for them to smoke. 'This was, in effect, for those interested in drinking and smoking cannabis, a good place to spend the weekend. 'But there was more to it. This wasn’t just provision of alcohol and cannabis. There was a motive behind it: It was grooming, grooming these young boys... because when they were drunk, or to use the common expression ""stoned"", struggling to function normally, she would be in a position to take advantage. 'The prosecution case is that is what she did. She took advantage.' Goatley’s Tesco clubcard showed a purchase of 18 bottles of Stella Artois lager and a four-pack of Smirnoff Ice alcopops on March 19 last year - the same day the message was sent to the boy about having '18 bottles of Stella'. Mr Walsh said in addition to the alcohol, the cannabis was provided or 'money given to them to source it'. When the first alleged victim was in such a state that he could barely stand, Goatley was said to have taken advantage of the situation to have sex with him at her home, Reading Crown Court heard . Once the boys’ inhibitions were down Goatley would use sexual language, telling them she would 'do it with them all night', the court heard. When the first alleged victim was in such a state that he could barely stand, Goatley was said to have taken advantage of the situation to have sex with him at her home. The following morning she was said to have performed a sex act on him. Later that day, as she was in hospital awaiting an operation, he began receiving messages from her, which read: 'Do you regret anything???' and a smiley face, it was said. When he said he did not think so, she asked: 'Can you remember it all? Be honest hun x.' He responded with: 'Not after I was sick,' to which she returned: 'Oh' and a sad face. As the conversation continued she was said to have written: 'I’m sorry. I thought you actually liked it/me. I was wrong. It was my fault,' before later adding: 'If it was a mistake just say.' She then told him: 'Make sure you delete these messages please babe.' Mr Walsh asked the jury: 'What is she talking about. What is the it/me she’s talking about there? Was what a mistake, and is he interested in what, you might wonder?' It was two days later that she was back in touch, mentioning the 'Stella and weed'. When she was first interviewed by police Goatley told them that no such sexual activity had taken place as the boys had described and that the 'it' in the Facebook conversation had related to smoking cannabis and not sex. Yet when she was interviewed a second time, Goatley changed her account, the jury heard, and said her memory of the messages and of everything she had told police in the first interview had been affected by prescription painkillers given to her by the doctor at the police station. She said she had not sent the messages to the boy. 'She said she didn’t remember having those exchanges and because it wasn’t her that had been sending those messages it must have been someone else, unless the boy had been going into his Facebook account and sending himself those messages,' said Mr Walsh. Goatley denies one charge of permitting her premises to be used for smoking cannabis, one of committing an offence with the intention of committing a sexual offence, one of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and two of engaging in sexual activity with a child. The trial, before Judge Johannah Cutts QC, at Reading Crown Court, continues.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . MPs are packing their bags for a 20-day break because Parliament has run out things to debate. The Commons and the Lords will not sit again until the Queen’s Speech on June 4, sparking claims of a ‘zombie Parliament’. There are also concerns that because Parliament does not really exist during prorogation it cannot be recalled in the event of a national emergency, or an escalation of tensions in Ukraine. MPs gathered for Prime Minister's Questions today, the last session until the Queen's Speech in June 4 . It had been thought that Parliament would break next week, but at the weekend it emerged ministers were preparing to prorogue on Thursday night. However, with no new laws to debate the constitutional procedure of proroguing Parliament - involving tricorn hats and Norman French – will take place tonight. Labour MP Chris Bryant said: ‘It is daft to prorogue today. Parliament will not be able to be summoned, in any event at all, until 4 June.’ Shadow Commons leader Angela Eagle told the BBC: ‘It does feel a bit like it’s the undead running around at the moment. ‘What they ought to be doing is they should have had a proper legislative programme for five years. ‘They’ve had five years to know that that’s where they were going to be and instead we’ve seen a government running out of steam, running out of ideas, keeping Parliament ticking over because they can’t think of things to do. It’s not showing the right level of respect to Parliament.’ However the government has rejected the idea that it has run out of policies. Tory minister Andrew Lansley said: ‘It's always the case every year that once we've completed the business that has been set down for a particular session, so that once the government bills and other bills have complete their passage, then Parliament rises and there is what is called 'prorogation', which is the gap before the start of the new session. At around 7pm, Leader of the Lords Lord Hill will read a message from the Queen to begin proroguing Parliament. Commons Leader Andrew Lansley, pictured sitting behind David Cameron today, has rejected claims that the government has run out of ideas . Recalling MPs in the event of an emergency is very difficult and would require a Royal Warrant. Foreign Secretary William Hague yesterday warned MPs it would be ‘unprecedented’ and could only happen in ""extreme circumstances if there is a threat to the United Kingdom"". Embarrassingly MPs have only been back in Westminster for eight days since they returned from a 17-day Easter recess. They also had nine days off in mid-February for a half term break, which came only four and a half weeks after their Christmas break which last from December 19 to January 6.","Tories and Lib Dems order break because there are no more laws to discuss .

"By . John Hall . and Hugo Gye . New homeowners in a single suburban street have paid the government more than £1million in stamp duty in just two years.

The average sum levied on a transaction was £65,532, with the properties purchased ranging from a two bedroom flat to five-bedroom terraced houses. The highest bill was the estimated £99,970 thought to have been paid by the new owners of 52 Hillier Road when they bought the three-bedroom property for £1,999,408 last December. The lowest stamp duty bill is believed to be the estimated £23,450 paid on 63b Hillier Road - a two-bedroom flat which sold for £557,000 in October 2011. That property changed hands again in November last year for £699,950, with its stamp duty rising to an estimated £27,998.

Cost of owning: The highest bill was the estimated £99,970 thought to have been paid by the new owners of 52 Hillier Road when they bought the three-bedroom property for £1,999,408 last December . Housing: The lowest stamp duty bill on Hillier Road in the last two years is believed to be the estimated £23,450 paid on 63b Hillier Road (pictured left) - a two-bedroom flat which sold for £557,000 in October 2011. That property changed hands again in November last year for £699,950, with its stamp duty rising to an estimated £27,998 . Another Hillier Road property - the three-bedroom terraced house at number 55 - was also sold twice during the period in which the data was gathered. It fetched . £990,000 in January 2012, when its stamp duty was an estimated £39,600. By November that year, the price tag had risen to £1.79million and the . tax bill to £89,750. Property website Zoopla estimates the current value of the house to be £2,193,939 - meaning it would cost a buyer an extra £153,575 in stamp duty.

Just one year ago, renters were paying only four per cent less than homeowners, but as house prices soar buying has become increasingly unaffordable . Anger: The government is facing growing calls for stamp duty - which was introduced in 2003 - to be reformed. Critics argue it puts people off buying properties. Stamp duty starts at 1 per cent for those paying between £125,001 and £250,000, and rises 7 per cent for homes costing more than £2million . Ministers are also under pressure to tackle the housing bubble, which has put home ownership increasingly out of reach of millions of Britons. The price of the average home in the UK has risen by 11 per cent over the past year, to a new high of £260,000. By . contrast, the cost of renting rose by 3.7 per cent in the year to . April, according to figures from property firm Countrywide. Across the nation, the average monthly rent stands at £873, up from £837 a year ago. The . company says that for every £1 of mortgage repayments by a homeowner . with a 10 per cent deposit, the average renter has to pay only 93p. That gap is even wider in London, epicentre of the housing boom, where renters pay just 86p compared to mortgage repayments. Stamp duty starts at 1 per cent for those paying between £125,001 and £250,000, and rises to seven per cent for homes costing more than £2million. Buyers are charged three per cent of the price when paying between £250,001 and £500,000 for a property. A four per cent tax is levied on homes fetching between £250,001 and £500,000, rising to 5 per cent for properties bought for more £1million and up to £2million. The UK house price bubble is continuing to cause concern for for homeowners, with the cost of buying a property rising at its fastest rate for nearly seven years. The average home now costs nearly £18,000 more than it did last year, with house prices jumped by 11 per cent year-on-year. This is the first time that annual house price inflation has been in double figures since 2010, and the highest rate since June 2007. Ministers are now under pressure to tackle the bubble, which is putting home ownership increasingly out of the reach of millions. Earlier this month Robert Gardner, chief economist at the Nationwide, Britain’s biggest building society, warned of the ‘wide margin’ between the rate at which house prices are rising and people’s pay rises. Bubble: Figures from the Office of National statistics show that house prices have increased by 10.9 percent over the past year . The average worker with a full-time job earns around £27,000, but the average house price has jumped to £183,577, which is nearly seven times higher than their salary. Official figures, from the Office for National Statistics, reveal the average pay rises is currently 1.7 per cent a year, compared to house price growth of 10.9 per cent a year. As a result, people’s pay is barely moving but house prices are rising rapidly. The luxury housing market is also hit by the bubble. Last month the property company owned by the Duke of Westminster has sold off £240million of luxury homes in central London amid fears the capital's house price bubble may be about the burst. Grosvenor Group said it was cutting its exposure to high-end residential properties after growing concerned that the rate of growth in the London luxury house price market was unsustainable.","Analysis of sold house prices on Hillier Road in Wandsworth, south London reveal vast sums paid in stamp duty .

"By . Ryan Lipman . A male GP has been found guilty of professional misconduct after it was revealed he violated female patients, including 'nuzzling' a woman's breast while conducting a skin examination. Dr Mohammed Naiyer, from the NSW North Coast, was found guilty by the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal over inappropriate behaviour towards two female patients on separate occasions in 2011. A 25-year-old patient, know as Patient A, was at the medical centre where Dr Naiyer worked so she could have a mole removed from her buttock, the Medical Observer reported. Breach of trust: GP Dr Mohammed Naiyer violated female patients including 'nuzzling' a woman's breast while conducting a skin examination in a medical centre where he worked . Dr Naiyer waited for a nurse who was present during the removal procedure to leave before inviting Patient A into his office so he could inspect a mole on her right breast. 'When I looked down I recall seeing the white of [the respondent's] eyes and observed his mouth brushing or nuzzling my breast,' Patient A said. More...

Woman raped on Sydney train with passengers nearby: Police appeal to four possible witnesses after 21-year-old attacked on way home from Kings Cross . Earlier in the same year, Patient A visited the centre with concerns she had contracted an STI. While the patient previously expressed concern about the mole, in her statement to the tribunal, she said the doctor used a dermascope to look at the mole and at the same time she could also feel him moving his head in a circular motion over the top of her breast. Inappropriate behaviour: The doctor was found guilty of two counts of unsatisfactory professional conduct for incidents towards two female patients in 2011 . After he took blood samples from the patient, Dr Naiyer completed a physical examination including internal and external examinations of her vagina and anus. Despite being compulsory by law, the GP did not record details of the examination and went on to deny it took place. It was found by the tribunal that the examination did not need to be carried out and that Dr Naiyer knowingly provided false information to the Health Care Complaints Commission in his denial that the examination occurred. A second 32-year-old woman known as Patient B also attended the tribunal to give evidence against the doctor. Dr Naiyer used a dermascope to look at a mole on patient's breast and at the same time moved his head in a circular motion over the top of her breast . Patient B said Dr Naiyer had asked her to save his mobile number and if 'next time we can do coffee or coffee at night?' While giving expert evidence, skin cancer primary care physician Dr Peter Kean Mun Lye said in his 22 years experience using a dermascope he never needed any part of his face, including his mouth, to touch a patient. NSW skin cancer practitioner and GP Dr Hein Carel Vandenbergh also testified against Dr Naiyer and said a direct vaginal examination in relation to an STI needed to take place with a swab or speculum.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Cocaine and heroin are smuggled into jails on an almost daily basis, shocking new figures show. Hard drugs, knives and mobile phones were among contraband seized in prisons hundreds of times last year. Prison guards found cocaine, heroin and knives more than once a day, raising fears about security behind bars. Cocaine was found in jails in England and Wales 80 times last year, raising questions about how it ended up in the hands of inmates . New figures reveal the scale of contraband seizures in the nation's prisons in 2013 . Ministers insist contraband in prisons is taken ‘extremely seriously’, with new technology used to block mobile phone signals and x-ray scanners used to stop illegal items being smuggled in to prisoners. But new figures reveal the scale of the problem in jails holding some of Britain’s most serious criminals. Figures released in Parliament show 352 knives and drugs seizures were made last year, more than one a day. It included 80 seizures of cocaine, 210 of heroin and at least 62 knives, although the figures did not including details of weapons found in every high security prison. It includes five heroin seizures and two for cocaine at Wormwood Scrubs, two heroin bundles at Wandsworth prison. G4S-run Rye Hill prison in Warwickshire, a category B jail holding 664 male inmates, made eight cocaine seizures and nine of heroin. Forest Bank prison in Salford made the most heroin seizures - 11 - and three of cocaine. The Category B jail holds 1,300 male prisons. The figures were released in Parliament in response to a parliamentary question by Labour MP Jim Cunningham. Latest figures on mobile phones, dating from 2012, showed 7,301 handsets or SIM Cards were found, up from 6,756 in 2010. Sadiq Khan, Labour’s shadow justice secretary, said: ‘The amount of drugs and knives getting into our prison revealed by this data is alarming. ‘How can we possibly punish and reform criminals if contraband and weapons are circulating so freely in our jails? ‘This needs a concerted effort by ministers to put a stop to this, but with all their cuts to prison staff and the increased overcrowding and violence on their watch in our prisons, I’ve not got much confidence they’re up to it.’ David Cameron is pictured visiting Wormwood Scrubs, where staff made five heroin seizures and two for cocaine in 2013 . The Ministry of Justice insisted that anyone caught with illegal contraband in jail will face tough penalties. Justice minister Jeremy Wright said: ‘National Offender Management Service, which runs jails in England and Wales, takes the issue of all contraband in prisons extremely seriously and deploys a comprehensive range of robust searching and security measures to detect items of contraband both at the point of entry to the prison and concealed within the prison. ‘These include targeted searching, random and targeted mandatory drug tests, the use of x-ray machines and CCTV surveillance cameras, Body Orifice Security Scanners to detect contraband secreted internally, and the imposition of closed (non-contact) visits. ‘Prisoners found with prohibited items face swift and robust punishment. This can include having days added to their custody, being transferred to a different prison and losing privileges.’","Cocaine seized 80 times, heroin 210 times and knives 62 times in 2013 .

"By . Sam Webb . Two men have been jailed for a large-scale human trafficking ring which saw Hungarians lured to work in the UK as modern-day slaves - being paid a measly £10 for a 100-hour week. Up to 50 men were kept in one house in Batley, West Yorkshire, and were subjected to regular beatings - with one house rule that no-one could say ‘no’ to their keepers. Janos Orsos, 43, and Ferenc Illes, 25, were sentenced on Tuesday at Teesside Crown Court to five years and three years respectively after pleading guilty to people trafficking offences. The court heard Orsos preyed on vulnerable Hungarians with promises of well-paid factory and labouring work and accommodation. Scroll down for video . Janos Orsos, 43, and Ferenc Illes, 25, were sentenced on Tuesday at Teesside Crown Court to five years and three years respectively after pleading guilty to people trafficking offences . But on arrival they were faced with squalid and cramped accommodation, long hours with barely any pay, and beatings from Orsos if they disobeyed his orders. Workers lived in accommodation in Ravensthorpe, Batley, Heckmondwike and Bradford, where beatings were regularly dished out by Orsos. They were then sent to work throughout Dewsbury, Bradford and Wakefield. Many were too scared to escape and one woman who had lost her job feared for her life after she overheard Orsos saying she would be killed. Sentencing, Judge Peter Armstrong said the victims were forced to live in 'severely cramped, multi-occupancy rooms in Dewsbury and left in fear of violence if they protested'. West Yorkshire Police launched Operation Tavernhouse back in 2011 after an alleged victim - a 20-year-old man - contacted the charity Hope For Justice and told them he was being exploited. More victims soon came forwards and others were identified, helping officers to build a case which identified the principle suspects. Sickening: Det Sgt Paul Simm, of Kirklees CID, said these offences do not belong in modern Britain . Among those exploited was a 45-year-old woman who was kept prisoner and forced to do housework for free. She was not given clothes and was only fed once a day during her captivity. She was later given more freedom and was eventually able to flee and catch a train away from the town. The court heard a Hungarian man was put up in Ravensthorpe and forced to work for more than 21 weeks for just £30 and lost more than 10 kilos in weight. Both Illes, of Dewsbury, and Orsos, of Heckmondwike, admitted charges of conspiracy to traffic people within the UK for exploitation dating back to 2011. The pair were due to face a six-week trial with 13 witnesses who had been trafficked by the pair, until they pleaded guilty. Orsos was also guilty of blackmail and converting criminal property. The court heard he made at least £60,000 from the conspiracy, which was sent out of the country using a Western Union account. Sentencing him, Judge Peter Armstrong said: 'This was a criminal enterprise from the outset. Having got people to come to this country you were in effect number one in the gang over here. 'These people were forced to work by being in an atmosphere of fear of being beaten or having no alternative economic means of moving away.' Illes was described by Judge Armstrong as Orsos’s 'right hand man'. He was in charge when Orsos was away and drove victims to and from work. Judge Armstrong added: 'You were aware of the conditions in which these people were living and the conditions in which they were working yet you were prepared to work for this gang, albeit acting under instructions from Orsos.' Det Sgt Paul Simm, of Kirklees CID, added: 'We are pleased to see the conviction of Orsos and Illes today for offences which, quite simply, should not be taking place in 21st century Britain.' Hope For Justice director of operations Allan Doherty said after the case: 'With upwards of 30 or 40 people living in a two-bedroom house, can you imagine the smell, the overcrowding, the dirt? 'People were living on scraps of food or slop that was reheated again and again. 'You wouldn’t let animals be kept in those conditions. This case highlights the issues of human trafficking and I know people hearing this sickening story today will be shocked that slavery is happening in their towns. 'But the fact of the matter is that human trafficking is a significant and unacceptable problem in Britain in the 21st century.' Det Chief Insp Paul Jeffrey of Kirklees CID, added: 'These convictions have followed a long running, detailed and at times, difficult investigation and I want to thank partners including Hope For Justice, who have worked with us to bring this case to a conclusion. 'I would encourage anyone who feels they may be a victim of this type of trafficking and is being exploited to contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.' West Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Mark Burns-Williamson, who is spearheading the creation of the national working group to tackle human trafficking, said: 'This very sad case demonstrates yet again that human trafficking is an issue which exists within West Yorkshire and that fact cannot be ignored.'","Janos Orsos and Ferenc Illes promised work but kept victims as slaves .

"By . Mark Duell . Choked to death: Gauravdeep Bassi  accidentally picked up the dropped nut and put it in his mouth . A seven-month-old baby died after choking to death on a pistachio nutshell which paramedics did not remove, an inquest has heard. Gauravdeep Bassi had been crawling on the living room floor when he accidentally picked up the dropped shell and put it in his mouth. His mother Rajwinder Kaur, 37, of West Bromwich, West Midlands, immediately called for an ambulance as her son struggled for breath. But when paramedics arrived after three minutes on March 17 last year they did not even try to remove the shell which was lodged in the child's throat, Smethwick Coroner’s Court heard. He died after being transferred to Sandwell General Hospital with the object still obstructing his airway. The shell was lodged in his throat for more than 21 minutes before he died. Pathologist Tamas Morton said his life could have been saved if an emergency tracheotomy had been carried out en route to the hospital. Giving evidence on Monday, Mrs Kaur said she had been in the house with her sister and nephew and were all in the same room together. She added: ‘I was cleaning away toys at the time and I do not know when the baby got down on the floor. No-one saw him pick up the shell. I heard his breathing and knew something was wrong. 'Accidental airway obstruction': Gauravdeep is pictured aged three months (left) and two months (right). The shell was lodged in his throat for more than 21 minutes before he died . ‘I did not know it was a nutshell - I just knew he had put something in his mouth. I called for an ambulance.’ Mrs Kaur said before crews had arrived she and other members of the family had tried to dislodge the object by patting her son on the back. On the advice of ambulance service staff on the phone they had also carried out chest compressions until paramedics had arrived. She added: ‘When they arrived they checked his breathing and his neck and took him straight away.’ Taken by ambulance: Gauravdeep died after being transferred to Sandwell General Hospital (pictured) House: Gauravdeep's mother said before crews had arrived at her home in West Bromwich (pictured) she and other members of the family had tried to dislodge the object by patting her son on the back . The inquest was told crews may 'not have been fully aware of the situation' and the shell had not been removed until arrival at hospital. 'No-one saw him pick up the shell. I heard his breathing and knew something was wrong' Rajwinder Kaur, mother . But attempts to revive the youngster were unsuccessful and he was pronounced dead at Sandwell Hospital. Mr Morton told the hearing: ‘All of my observations show there was no underlying medical condition. ‘However any findings in cases such as this are not specific so in this case I have to rely on circumstantial evidence. I would give the medical cause of death as accidental airway obstruction.’ Cause of death: When paramedics arrived after three minutes on March 17 last year they did not even try to remove the pistachio nutshell (file picture) which was lodged in the child's throat, the court heard . Senior coroner for the Black Country Mr Robin Balmain adjourned the inquest to hear from a representative from West Midlands Ambulance Service. 'I would give the medical cause of death as accidental airway obstruction' Tamas Morton, pathologist . Mr Balmain said he wanted to know if crews were trained to give this procedure and to hear more about how paramedics responded in this case. He added: ‘I am not going to conclude this case today. I want to hear from the ambulance service.’ The inquest will resume at a date still to be set. West Midlands Ambulance Service has declined to comment until the conclusion of the inquest.","Gauravdeep Bassi picked up dropped shell on floor and put it in his mouth .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Interest rates will not be hiked to tackle runaway house prices despite fears they are running out of control, the Bank of England's Governor Mark Carney revealed this morning. Mr Carney said using the Bank's power to put up interest rates on people's mortgages 'would not be the right tool' to to tackle a house price bubble. He added: 'Will not target house prices.' His remarks come amid growing fears that ordinary family homes are becoming unaffordable - even as fresh figures suggested that the economic recovery had finally taken hold. The Bank chief warned however that the recovery had not yet made it 'through the qualifying rounds of the World Cup' despite falling unemployment, rising wages and house price increases. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney admitted the prospect of rate rises had moved closer - but revealed they were likely to stay historically low a long time to come . House prices soared by 9.2 per cent across the country last year - and by more than 18 per cent in London. This far outstripped the 1.7 per cent rise in average earnings in the year to March, according to figures released by the Office for National Statistics today. Wages are, however, now increasing slightly more than inflation - currently running at 1.6 per cent - for first time in four years. Mr Carney this morning said the Bank would only use a rate rise as a 'last resort' to tackle runaway house prices. 'We do have a range of other tools and these are tools, some of which we have a very high degree of confidence about their effectiveness,' Mr Carney said. He said the Bank 'cannot control all aspects of the housing market', adding that has no power to build a single one of the 120,000 houses experts say are needed houses needed to meet demand. But Mr Carney admitted that the booming economy had 'edged closer' the time when interest rates would begin rising again after more than five years at just 0.5 per cent. Just last week the Bank held the rate at its record low for another month. The Bank of England Governor this morning said house price rises would not influence their decision to increase interest rates . Britain’s economy has 'started to head back to normal', Mark Carney said. But he stressed that any increase would be 'gradual and limited' and warned that it 'may stay at historically low levels for some time'. He added that the economic recovery was not yet secure. He said:  ‘Securing the recovery is like making it through the qualifying rounds of the World Cup. ‘That is an achievement, but not the ultimate goal. The real tournament is just beginning and its prize is a strong, sustained and balanced expansion. Across the Bank we are setting policy in order to help win that prize for the good of the people of the United Kingdom.’ Mr Carnye's remarks prompted bookmakers to slash the odds on an interest rate rise before the General Election. Despite the Governor's attempts to downplay the possibility, Ladbrookes cut the odds of a rate rise before May next year to 4/6. But the chances of rates staying at 0.5% until next year's likely poll have been pushed out to 11/10 from even money. Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said: 'Carney's not convinced us in the slightest and the odds of a rise have been cut accordingly.' Mr Carney's intervention this morning came after figures revealed the number of people in work has reached a record high after further falls in unemployment. But Labour claimed the figures obscured the fact that ordinary families were still feeling the squeeze. Employment Minister Esther McVey welcomed this morning's employment figures as more evidence that the economic recovery had taken hold . Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said: 'Average earnings have finally crept up above CPI inflation, though only when bonuses are included, and there is a huge amount of lost ground to catch up. 'Working people are now over £1,600 a year worse off than when David Cameron came to office and the link between the wealth of the nation and family finances remains broken. 'While the top one per cent have seen their share of national income rise over the last year, the bottom 90 per cent have seen theirs fall. It's totally out of touch for the Tories to try and claim the cost-of-living crisis faced by hardworking Britain is suddenly over. 'Thousands of people in work are struggling to make ends meet because the Government's failure to make work pay and tackle the cost-of-living crisis.' GMB general secretary Paul Kenny added: 'GDP per head is still 5.8% below 2007 levels. ""That is the root cause of average earnings being down 13.8% in real terms since then. The pay of the bottom half of the workforce is still being squeezed. Public sector workers' pay is being frozen or increasing less than inflation."" The TUC's general secretary Frances O'Grady backed Mr Kenny - and urged the Government not to 'kid themselves' that the recovery was pulling everyone out of poverty. She said: 'It a real concern that rising employment is failing to boost pay, which is barely growing in real terms. This should serve as a reminder to the Bank of England that this is not a full-blown recovery, and that an early rise in interest rates could choke it off.' However the Tory employment minister Esther McVey said: 'As the recovery takes hold, more people are able to get a job or set up their own business and become the employers of tomorrow. 'Each and every person who has made a new start or hired someone new is helping to make Britain a more prosperous and confident place to be. 'We will continue to support those in and out of work who want to get on and fulfil their ambitions for a more secure future.' Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted:  'There's more to do, but it's welcome unemployment is down again. More jobs means more financial security for people.'","Mark Carney says rate rise has moved closer as economy picks up .

"By . Ruth Styles . From Lady Gaga to delicate rose bushes, it seems there's little that artist May Sum can't turn into a sculpture. But these are not your average sculpture. Instead of stone or bronze, Sum creates her incredibly intricate pieces using lipstick. Unfortunately for those who fancy owning a lipstick sculpture of their own, would-be buyers will need deep pockets, as each piece costs an eye-watering £529. Clever: Hong Kong artist May Sum turns ordinary lipsticks into mini sculptures and sells them for £529 . Nevertheless, the Hong Kong artist says that her pieces can be used for their original purpose, although they might not look the same afterwards. 'They can be used since all the lipsticks are new,' Sum explained in an exclusive interview with MailOnline. 'I like to use MAC and Nars because their texture is harder and they always have special colours,' she continues. 'Chanel is also great, as they  have a  beautiful red colour series.' The lipsticks, which have now gone on sale at luxury launches website, VeryFirstTo.com, are available in a choice of themes and can also be customised with portraits of the customer's choice. Sum, who began her career as a make-up artist, takes between 12 and 13 hours to create a floral sculpture but says the more detailed portraits can take up to a week. Elaborate: Lipsticks used in Sum's botanical series are set in flower-filled wooden containers . 'As a senior make up artist, I understand cosmetics very well,' adds Sum. 'But understanding  cosmetics doesn't mean being limited. 'I reinterpreted the meaning of lipstick. Each sculpture makes lipstick become an art work. Each lipstick is a brand-new story.' For those wondering what sort of person wants lipstick-turned-art in their lives, Sum has some answers. 'Most of the people who order the lipsticks do so as a . special gift to special person,' she reveals. No limit: According to Sum, clients can choose to have their own or another portrait sculpted onto their lipstick . 'I have quite a lot of male clients who . order it for their wives, which is so sweet. Of course some of my clients . order them for themselves, as they want their own face on the lipstick.' While for now Sum says she's concentrating on lipstick art, she says she won't rule out working with different types of cosmetic in future. 'i have done it before,' she explains earnestly. 'I once used stick foundation to create my art and I'd like to try powder foundation and eye shadow.' She pauses for a second and adds: 'Blusher too!' Iris Apfel (l) and Vivienne Westwood (r) star again, alongside Madonna (second from left) May says keep the lipstick around 17-25¿. Do not put it into the refrigerator as it will crack .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Internet access is as essential as water, the government has been warned as figures show 6.4million people have never been online. The government is under pressure to increase high speed web access across the country, with more and more official services now only offered digitally. Almost all 16 to 24 year olds used the internet in the first three months of this year, compared with just a third of over-75s, amid claims it is now ‘impossible to function’ without broadband. New figures from the Office for National Statistics shows how the proportion of people using the internet is continuing to fall . Some 4.6 million adults in the UK used the internet in the first quarter of this year, up 1.1 million on the same time in 2013. However, 6.4 million – 13 per cent of all adults - had never used the internet. In all, 89 per cent of men used the internet, compared to 85 per cent of women. London had the highest proportion of web users (90 per cent) while Northern Ireland had lowest (79 per cent). In the House of Lords, the government was warned it needed to do more to roll-out high speed broadband across the country. Tory peer Baroness Neville-Rolfe said: ‘Broadband and mobile coverage have become essential utilities, like water or power. ‘Without coverage it is like living in the old world without a post box or hot water,’ the former Number 10 policy official said. She the government needed to encourage the industry and the regulator ‘to buck up and meet their obligations to citizens and businesses, all of whom now need to be able to operate online’. Men are more likely to have used the internet than women, the new figures show . 99.3 per cent of women aged 16-24 have used the internet, compared to 29.5 over over-75s . Lord Addington, a senior Lib Dem, added: ‘It is virtually impossible to function without broadband.’ He asked how ‘people are supposed to cope until this situation is corrected’. Campaigners are particularly concerned that older people, who are less likely to be online, will struggle access government services. Of the 6.4 million adults who have never used the internet, almost half were aged 75 years and over. However, in the last three years the proportion of adults aged 75 years and over who have ever used the internet has increased by 13 percentage points . Higher earners are also more likey to use the web. Amongst people earning more than £500-a-week, or £26,000-a-year, almost everyone uses the internet. But among those earning less than £200-a-week or £10,400, one in 20 had never used the internet. London had the highest proportion of web users (90 per cent) while Northern Ireland had lowest (79 per cent) The government insists that good progress is being made to roll-out superfast broadband. Culture minister Lord Gardiner of Kimble said: ‘In January this year the programme was making superfast broadband available to 10,000 premises a week. ‘The figure is now 20,000 a week, and by the summer it will be 40,000 a week. More than half a million premises have benefited so far and more than 4 million will benefit by the end of the programme. ‘For mobile, the combination of commercial and government mobile rollout will improve mobile services for 98% of UK premises by 2015. ‘Clearly, we are in part of the technological revolution and the Government wish to go digital, but it is certainly important that those who do not have the facility are still able to conduct business in a traditional way.’","1 in 8 people have never used internet, says Office for National Statistics .

"By . Jill Reilly . A British executive of drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline has been charged with corruption after a probe found the firm made billions of yuan from bribing doctors and hospitals. Mark Reilly and two Chinese executives, Zhang Guowei and Zhao Hongyan, were also suspected of bribing officials in the industry and commerce departments of Beijing and Shanghai, the official Xinhua news agency reported, quoting police in Hunan province. The announcement was the first time a foreign employee in China of British-based GSK was accused in the investigation announced last July. A British executive of drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline has been charged with corruption after a probe found the firm made billions of yuan from bribing doctors and hospitals . It highlighted the widespread use of payments to doctors and hospitals by sellers of drugs and medical equipment in a state-run and poorly funded health system that Chinese leaders have promised to improve. Reilly is accused of operating a 'massive bribery network,' said a police official, Gao Feng, at a news conference. He said the case had been handed over to prosecutors. He said that resulted in 'illegal revenue' of billions of yuan (hundreds of millions of dollars). Gao said that as far as he knew, Reilly still was in China, but he had no details of his status. He said dozens of other people also were implicated but he gave no names or other details. Reilly is GSK's senior vice president of pharmaceuticals for China and Hong Kong and former general manager for China. Beginning in January 2009, Mark Reilly was accused of ordering his sales team to pay doctors, hospital officials and health institutions to use GSK's products (file photo) Police previously identified four Chinese employees of GSK who they said confessed to bribery. A second foreign drugmaker, AstraZeneca, said in July that police in Shanghai were investigating one of its salespeople. The company has given no information since then. Chinese state media have publicized the investigations of GSK and AstraZeneca. But economists who study Chinese health care say such payments are more widely used by China's domestic drug manufacturers. Doctors and hospitals routinely accept informal payments from patients and suppliers of medical goods to top up low salaries and cover gaps in budgets. Hospitals also raise money by adding surcharges to drug prices and assigning employees sales quotas. That can also distort treatment by encouraging overuse of expensive drugs or procedures. As a result of bribery, GSK was able to receive prices for its medications that were up to seven times the level of the same products sold in other countries, Gao said. In a separate statement, police in the central city of Changsha, where the investigation began, said Reilly and two Chinese executives also are accused of bribing government officials in Beijing and Shanghai. Police in Changsha said last July that employees appeared to be trying to evade GSK's internal anti-bribery controls by making payments totaling as much as 3 billion yuan ($490 million) to a travel agency that gave back at least part of that money. The investigations coincide with efforts by Communist Party leaders to improve China's health system and rein in surging costs of medicine and medical care that are fueling public frustration . One of the detained Chinese employees was shown on state television at that time describing how he paid bribes to government officials to win support for use of the company's medications. The British Embassy in Beijing said it could not comment while the case was underway and referred questions to GSK. Gao said possible charges include bribing nongovernment workers and bribing corporate units, while GSK might face charges of corporate bribery. GSK said previously it shared the Chinese government's desire to 'root out corruption' and supported the investigation. The company has given the investigation its 'full support and assistance,' said Gao. He said GSK employees had obstructed previous inquiries into possibly misconduct by bribing investigators and other government personnel. Britain's biggest pharmaceuticals group bribery was against its values. ""We take the allegations that have been raised . very seriously. They are deeply concerning to us and contrary to the . values of GSK,"" it said in a brief statement. ""We want to reach a . resolution that will enable the company to continue to make an important . contribution to the health and welfare of China and its citizens."" The investigations coincide with efforts by Communist Party leaders to improve China's health system and rein in surging costs of medicine and medical care that are fueling public frustration. Under the current system, the state-set price to see an oncologist or other specialist is as little as 7 yuan ($1.10), less than the cost of a hamburger and too little to cover a hospital's expenses. The top salary for an experienced physician might be as little as 6,000 yuan ($980) per month. The ruling party has promised higher spending on health care, but economists say that with a population of 1.3 billion people, the cost of a full-scale overhaul will be high. Mr Reilly is understood to be in his early fifties. He is a graduate of University College, London, where he studied for a BSc in medical sciences, and a PhD. He also holds an accountancy qualification. He has spent all his career with the pharmaceutical firm, working mainly in Britain, before moving to Singapore in 2003 for three years and becoming its most senior Chinese executive in January 2009, based in Shanghai. He lists his interests as football and squash. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Mark Reilly, is accused of operating a 'massive bribery network'

The brown-haired teen had alighted the Upfield service, packed with commuters, with a friend after having words with another passenger just before 5pm, The Weekly Review Melbourne Times reports. After the doors of the train closed he whipped out his spray can with disregard for his own safety. He wore a black rucksack on his back and appeared unfazed by the immediate danger he put himself in. Attempting to scare a passenger with whom he had exchanged words on the train, he held the can up against the window. The boy then leaned closely to the scratched window and bashed the can against the glass numerous times, according to passengers who say they did not know the boy. Foolish: The boy is wearing a checked shirt as he leans closely to the scratched window with his spray can . It is not clear whether the train was sprayed or damaged as it departed the station.

"By . Jill Foster . Less than 12 hours before I’m due to have a C-section to bring my twin daughters into the world and I’m on the phone to my younger sister Abigail, begging her to come to my flat. Sensing the urgency in my voice, she drives across South London to be with me. Naturally I’m restless. Like any mother-to-be, I want my babies to arrive safely. But I’m also concerned that a vital piece of equipment, one that will smooth my ride into the first few days of motherhood, has broken. Luckily my sister has a spare. A breast-pump, perhaps? Maybe a nappy-disposal system? Er no ... hair straighteners. Less than 12 hours before she was due to have a C-section to give birth to her twin daughters, Jill (pictured) asked sister Annabel to borrow her hair straighteners . The fact that I was even thinking about my hair when my main focus should have been my babies came as no surprise to my family. For decades, they have listened to me moan about my mop of unruly curls. It’s not only that it has more twists and turns than an Underground map, but it’s thicker than the entire cast of Made In Chelsea. If I was going to look anywhere near presentable in the post-partum snaps, it was going to need straightening. Was I being ridiculously vain? Absolutely. But I also knew that by fighting the frizz, I’d feel more in control as I embarked on the overwhelming journey into motherhood. It will come as no surprise that once Charlotte and Martha arrived, and were then whisked off to the special care unit because they were premature, I barely gave my hair a second thought. And since that day I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve sported straight hair. As a result, I’m finally coming round to the curly mane that used to be the bane of my life. Like Jill, Nicole Kidman has tried to hide her curly hair by straightening it . Seems I’m not alone. Earlier this week, fellow frizzhead Nicole Kidman admitted that after years of loathing her curly hair, she is learning to love it. The Oscar-winning actress said that her three-year-old daughter Faith has inherited her corkscrew ringlets and prefers it when her mother wears her hair au naturel. ‘I almost never straighten it any more; I let it go curly and wild,’ she said. ‘It’s taken me 40-something years, but I embrace the curl.’ The Oscar-winning actress said that her three-year-old daughter Faith has inherited her corkscrew ringlets and prefers it when her mother wears her hair au naturel. I can relate. I’m approaching 40 and it’s only since becoming a mum that I have appreciated my ringlets. It’s not simply a question of saving precious time — although drying my hair curly takes five minutes whereas having it straightened takes about 45 minutes, a myriad smoothing products and, often, a hairdresser. No, it’s because suddenly I’m happier in my hair. The smooth look that gave me such confidence when I worked in a stressful office environment no longer reflects my personality or circumstances. Life with two marauding toddlers is about as smooth as a Channel ferry crossing. Curly, wild hair matches my circumstances. Yes, it’s slightly out-of-control, but it’s more relaxed, less bothered about what others think about it. I inherited my bouncy hair from my father, Clive, whose dark head of curls has made him look like a cross between footballer Graeme Souness and comedian Bobby Ball. My late grandmother — whose hair was wavy, but not the full frizz — blamed the fact that she ate walnuts throughout her pregnancy, which always made us laugh. As a baby, I had a mop-top of curls, but oddly in my early childhood my hair straightened out to a glossy reddish brown.  Then, in the Eighties I had a bubble perm. As soon as I looked in the mirror I regretted it. Sure enough, at school I earned a range of nicknames from Crystal Tipps — the Seventies cartoon character with wild hair — to Aslan, the lion from C.S. Lewis’ Narnia Chronicles. Still, I felt sure it would grow out. Jill's perm left her looking like Aslan form the Chronicles of Narnia . Except it didn’t. Although perms are known to damage the hair, some experts believe the texture can also change during puberty thanks to hormones making each strand of hair thicken. What followed were years full of hair-angst. These were the days before serums banished frizz. I improvised with greasy concoctions of my own invention — one involving baby oil and Vaseline. If any boys had shown any interest — and they didn’t — they would have had to approach me in protective clothing. At university, I had to leave it curly as I couldn’t afford expensive hair products. But I’d tie it back, up or even wear hats indoors. Over the years the teasing continued, but I figured it was better to be talked about than ignored. It was during this time that hair straightening came into fashion. Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Aniston and Kylie all became purveyors of the poker-straight look. When I could afford it, I would get my locks smoothed professionally. Suddenly, I noticed I was taken more seriously. Jill found she was taken more seriously when she straightened her hair . It got me thinking about wavy hair and success. Apart from interior designer Kelly Hoppen and the late Body Shop founder Anita Roddick, there are few women with curls in positions of power. Straight hair means straight-talking and I recall an interview with a female BBC reporter who said she straightened her hair as curly hair wasn’t acceptable on air. Apparently, newsreader Natasha Kaplinsky also religiously straightens her naturally frizzy hair. Yet now, as I’m coming around to the idea of leaving my hair as nature intended, it seems I’m on trend. A survey of more than 2,000 women found that 74  per cent of those with wavy or curly hair say their look gets compliments. My husband Robin says my hair was one of the first things that attracted him to me and doesn’t like it when I straighten it. My daughters also seem to prefer curly mummy to straight mummy. When they see pictures of me looking glossy and groomed, they look confused. When they see me with a wild mane, they smile and say: ‘Mummy!’ which melts my heart. Likee Nicole Kidman, Jill will remain natural from now on for the sake of her daughters . Like Nicole Kidman, I will remain natural from now on for the sake of my daughters. Their baby-soft strands may be straight now but the curly gene is beginning to take hold at the edges. It looks impossibly gorgeous. I want them to know that it’s OK to be different. Of course, it’s inevitable that they will go through phases of hating their hair and I know I won’t be able to keep them away from straighteners for ever. But for now, I’ll be steering clear. In a world so obsessed with fixing every flaw, I’d hate for my girls to think they must iron out every imperfection just like mummy irons out her hair. Making a mane of corkscrews look ‘naturally beautiful’ can be an awful lot of hard work. Here are my top tips . . . TAME THE TANGLES . Brushing curls results in a cloud of fluff, but brushing before you get in the shower gets rid of tangles and means shampoo and conditioner work more effectively. Try John Frieda’s Curl Around Style Activating Conditioner (£5.59, boots.com) which you can even leave in overnight. When it comes to the final rinse, curly-haired Nadia Dean, stylist at London’s John Frieda salon, recommends tipping your head upside down and rinsing from the nape of your neck to the tips. ‘This stops the hair going flat at the roots,’ she says. USE A PRIMER . Because of their shape, curls never looks as shiny as straight hair. Sorry, laws of physics, flat surfaces reflect light better than curved ones. For a glossy look, try a primer. Living Proof Prime Style Extender (£18, spacenk.com) seals hair against water and the dreaded frizz, while Alterna Caviar Repair Protein Cream (£24.75, beautyflash.co.uk) renders even the coarsest hair sleek. Nadia suggests combing primer through using a Tangle Teezer (£10.20, lookfantastic.com). FIND A GREAT GADGET . If, like me, you’d rather not leave your curls to chance by letting them dry naturally, there are some excellent options. Curlformers (£10, thisisbeautymart.com) are the modern version of rolling your hair with rags but with spiral tubes. Babyliss’ Curl Secret (£119, johnlewis.com) might be pricey, but can’t be beaten. You clamp the gadget on a section of dry hair, then it winds the hair into the heated chamber and, releases a perfect curl. SLEEP IN A SCRUNCHIE . However you create curls, sparing use of a serum or oil is essential to give shine. My favourites include Charles Worthington Shine Booster All Over Gloss Spray (£5.99, boots.com) and L’Oreal Extraordinary Oil (£9.99, boots.com). To preserve your curls overnight, tie up your hair as high and as loose as possible — an old school scrunchie is ideal.","For decades Jill has moaned about her hair .

"By . Sam Webb . Business analyst Karl Howes, who drove into a lamppost after a night of heavy drinking and was so drunk he died of alcohol poisoning as he lay in the wreckage of his BMW . A business analyst who crashed his car after a night out was so drunk he died of alcohol poisoning as he lay in the wreckage of his BMW. Company high flyer Karl Howes, 34, ploughed into two vehicles and left a trail of destruction before flipping his own company car onto its roof when it hit a lamppost at 50mph. Despite the impact Mr Howes suffered no life threatening injuries but when police arrived at the scene he had already died as a result of 'acute alcohol intoxication' due to the estimated nine pints of lager and 'several' spirit shots he had drank. Friends who saw him in the run up to the crash said Mr Howes was acting 'like a zombie' but was still able to hug and talk to them. It is believed the grammar school and university educated keep fit fanatic, passed away shortly after the impact in Bingley, near Bradford, West Yorkshire. On December 20 last year after he consumed three pints of . lager with friends at a work Christmas do in Bingley before meeting . girlfriend Jodie Coonan, 29, an inquest heard. He . drank another six pints and spirit shots and planned to leave the black . car and get a cab but the couple became separated and Mr Howes decided . to drive home. As . he did so, his vehicle careered into a bus shelter, hit an oncoming car . and then subsequently swerved into a parked vehicle to his left. Friends . stopped Karl at scene of his first collisions with the bus shelter, to . urge him not to drive, describing him 'like a zombie' - but he ignored . them. A . short distance later, he hit the pavement outside a school and swerved . into a lamppost which catapulted his car upside down. The impact left . the lamppost leaning on a tree. PC . Paul Lightowler of West Yorkshire Police said: 'Karl had the company . car from new. He had been out with a friend for a Christmas party at a . pub. He was observed to consume three pints of lager and then Karl drove . them back to Bingley. 'He . parked the vehicle with intention of collecting it the next day but he . and his partner became separated and couldn’t reach each other by phone . despite a number of calls.' Despite the impact Mr Howes suffered no life threatening injuries but when police arrived at the scene he had already died as a result of 'acute alcohol intoxication' due to the nine pints of lager and the spirits he drank . He added: 'Karl . got into a BMW to drive home. He is seen on CCTV getting in the vehicle . and driving along the main street in Bingley, slowly and meandering. 'He stopped in a layby for some unknown reason then is seen reversing and he collided with a glass bus shelter.' Two . people Mr Howes knew came to assist him and asked him not to continue . driving but he hugged them, got back in his car and carried on. PC . Lightowler added: 'He left the bus stop travelling at a high speed. He . then collided with a white VW. The driver did stop but no damage was . done to his vehicle. 'When . he hit this car he moved to the left of the carriage way where he hit . another BMW vehicle which caused some damage but Karl did not stop and . carried on driving. We can see from footage that he accelerated away . from the incident. 'At . 1.40am an onlooker saw the car coming past at 50pmh and it seemed to . be swerving. The vehicle then hit the pavement, a grass verge, before . effectively using a lamppost as a ramp which turned it on its roof.' A . post-mortem test recorded superficial lacerations to the back of Mr . Howes’ head and forearm but acute alcoholic intoxication was recorded as . cause of death. PC . Lightowler said of the test results: 'I have never seen situation like . this. It is very unique. 'It seems that such a significant event to . happen at the time he died are linked together for me.' Ms . Coonan, 29, told the hearing: 'When I first met Karl he used to go out . on a Wednesday night to a Sunday night drinking. 'He would work those . days but would go out in the evenings drinking around four or five . pints. And all weekend he would drink. 'That . did get lower and lower as I knew him. He wouldn’t really be drunk . after five pints. When I saw him that night you could tell he had been . drinking but he was not stumbling.' He was formerly a national executive at the greeting cards firm Hallmark. It was . claimed he suffered bouts of depression due to his 'high-pressure' career path and began binge drinking and gambling heavily in 2010 . following an inquiry into his company expenses. Mr . Howes’ GP Dr Russell Livingstone told the Bradford hearing: 'He was . binge drinking in excess. He was offered support and counselling. He was . suffering from anxiety symptoms. 'He worked hard to maintain responsibility but explained he was exhausted from working ""silly hours"". 'He was developing negative thoughts and concerned about work. He remained agitated about the expenses action.' 'In . September 2010 he was put on anti-depressants and continued to have . peaks of feeling better and being anxious about the pressures of work. 'After . a period out of work in 2011 Karl was phased back before being made . redundant which he felt was handled badly,' added the GP. In January 2012 Mr Howes got a new job as a business analyst with a Bradford baking company Speedibake and was dealing with multi-million pound contracts and appeared to be happier. Recording a narrative verdict Bradford assistant coroner Dominic Bell accepted the post mortem findings but concluded Mr Howes’ death was 'attributed to a road crash attributed to the use of alcohol'.","Karl Howes, 34, left a trail of destruction before flipping his car .

"By . Daily Mail . A generation fell in love with Felicity Kendal as dungaree-wearing Barbara Good in TV’s The Good Life. And today, at 67, she still radiates sex appeal. This week she revealed: ‘I haven’t done fillers or Botox for ages. There comes a point where you have to match bits of you with the other bits, otherwise you get a terribly random situation.’ It was wise to call a halt to the Botox. But, given her enduring looks just how intense was the work Felicity’s had? Here, we reveal the effort that created this sensational 60-something from a promising young starlet . We reveal the effort that created this sensational 60-something . She may have given up Botox now, but that enviably smooth forehead is the beneficiary of regular past injections, as Felicity has admitted. Treatments are recommended between every three and six months. It seems Felicity’s long had a love-hate relationship with Botox. In an interview three years ago, she said that she had stopped having the procedure in 2010, but was thinking about going back to it once more. ‘I might have it again soon,’ she said. ‘It’s nice not to have lines when you frown, especially on TV. I don’t know why people make such a fuss about it. No one is interested if a woman has her  teeth capped or her hair dyed.’ Now, though, she says she has quit for good. It may be enviably firm, but Felicity attributes her youthful jawline to great genes because her mother also looked young right into her 70s. She also keeps her weight under control with yoga. As for a much rumoured facelift, Felicity denies all, saying that she visited Dr Laurence Kirwan only once, for Botox around ten years ago, and didn’t like the results so didn’t return to his clinic. A generation fell in love with Felicity in The Good Life, and today she still looks just as good as she did then . Felicity has admitted having fillers — to plump out nose-to-mouth lines as well as those around the eyes — in her cheeks, but without success. ‘Don’t have fillers when your cheekbones are high! It’s chipmunk time!’ She added: ‘The only thing to do eventually is the full thing [a facelift] but you have to do that when you’re 40.’ No squinting around the delicate eye area for Felicity. She had severe astigmatism for years, which meant that she needed to use a magnifying glass to apply her make-up. Then, fed up of the squinting, she had a lens implant in 2009. She later said: ‘I see more now than I ever did before. It’s the most magical operation in the world — you go from being blind to actually seeing.’ Naturally brunette, Felicity has been blonde and had essentially the same flicky, layered style for four decades and counting. Blonde bombshell: For many years, she has been a loyal client of the five-star Mayfair salon Michaeljohn . For many years, she has been a loyal client of the five-star Mayfair salon Michaeljohn, where she has it coloured and cut in a process which she complains takes more than two hours. Other Michaeljohn devotees have included Cherie Blair, Mick Jagger and Dustin Hoffman. Those perfect pins of Felicity’s are kept slender by strict regular exercise and a lifetime of yoga. She says that she remembers watching her mother, who ran a Shakespeare touring company in India, doing her yoga exercises when she was a small girl. Felicity said: ‘I used to exercise for three hours a week doing Pilates and weights. Now I have to do five or six hours to get the same result.’ Felicity was named Rear of the Year in 1981, no less, and has kept a shapely figure thanks to exercise and an active sex life, saying: ‘It’s part of life, like eating or breathing.’ She said that her experience in Strictly in 2010 — in which she stunned viewers by doing the splits — made her famous rear more pert than ever because she was dancing for six or more hours a day. Felicity said that taking part in Strictly in 2010 made her famous rear more pert than ever, because she was dancing for over six hours a day . Michael Rudman — the theatre director whom she married, divorced and is dating again — goes to the gym three or four times a week with her. Felicity says he is far more health conscious than her. Eternally trim, Felicity has always watched her weight, briefly going on a diet of nothing but seaweed in her 20s. Lunch is often just a bowl of Thai vegetable soup and a cup of coffee. ‘As for junk food, if I’d ever walked down the road eating anything, my father would have clouted me,’  she said. In 2009, she said: ‘I used to diet when I was younger because one wants to be skinny, but I don’t diet any more. I eat quite healthily. I don’t like stodgy food, so I am a salad, pasta and steak girl.’ Any vices? Well, she allows herself a couple of glasses of red wine and a sneaky cigarette if she feels like it. Felicity has confessed to being ‘rock chick’ at heart and had her first tattoo – a star on her foot representing her younger son, Jacob, 27, a fledgling criminal barrister — at the relatively late age of 63. A year later, she had a moon surrounded by feathers inscribed on her calf, which symbolises her elder son, Charley, and his two children. She’s now considering a third. Felicity spent her childhood in India, and the cosmetic legacy is still apparent today in the sun damage you can see on her chest. Brown spots and wrinkles pepper her decolletage and hands. But her face, by contrast, is as smooth and pure  as silk. How? Well, she’s confessed to having Polaris laser treatment on her face to combat the sun damage. It was administered by Dr Jean Louis Sebagh at a cost of around £200 a time. ‘It’s really quite painful,’ she told an interviewer. ‘But it takes off brown spots and makes skin finer.’ Devotees have to go back every three months to keep their skin looking peachy. Enjoying the sunshine: On holiday with her family . One wonders whether Felicity will extend the treatment to her body, too, to stop the mismatch effect. She’s also a fan of lathering on face cream, recently graduating from ‘good old Nivea’ to the pricey cult beauty favourite Creme de La Mer, which costs £103 for a tiny 30ml pot. She said: ‘I don’t wear a great deal of make-up, but I use lots of cream. I love Clarins After-Sun, which smells lovely — like a holiday in a tube — and is very nourishing.’","Felicity used to have regular Botox injections but stopped in 2010 .

"By . Jill Reilly . Three astronauts who had spent six months aboard the International Space Station have returned to  Earth - and one of their first requests was for a glass of red wine. Russian Mikhail Tyurin, American Rick Mastracchio and Koichi Wakata of Japan spent 188 days in space and touched down in a Kazakh steppe 148 km (93 miles) southeast of the town of Dzhezkazgan at 07:58 a.m. (0158 GMT). Search and recovery forces soon converged on the Russian Soyuz space capsule which was charred by extreme heat on re-entry, and opened the hatch, extracting the crew.

A smiling Tyurin was the first to experience Earth gravity after six months in orbit, taken from the capsule and carried to a semi-reclined chair, while a doctor checked his pulse and blood pressure. 'The heart rate is 100 (per minute),' a presenter for Russian space agency Roscosmos said. Tyurin, whose crew had symbolically carried a torch of Russia's Sochi Winter Olympics to orbit, was then shown making a call via a satellite telephone. 'The landing was wonderful. Everything was just perfect,' he said.

Finally, Mastracchio was extracted from the spacecraft, and the trio were then carried to an orange inflatable tent set up nearby to undergo medical checks before their flight to Star City outside Moscow. The returning space trio climbed inside their Russian Soyuz capsule and departed the orbital outpost at 6:36 p.m. EDT/2236 GMT as it flew 260 miles (418 km) over Mongolia.

The capsule lands in the steppes of Kazakhstan at  at 07:58 a.m. (0158 GMT) 'What an exciting time we shared in this increment,' Wakata said during a change-of-command ceremony broadcast on NASA Television. NASA astronaut Steven Swanson takes control of the station. Swanson and cosmonauts Alexander Skvortsov and Oleg Artemyev will manage the station, a $100-billion project of 15 nations, on their own, until new crewmates arrive on May 28. Until Tuesday, the station partnership, headed by the United States and Russia, had been relatively untouched by the rhetoric and economic sanctions stemming from Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. But the programme's protected status shifted after Dmitry Rogozin, Russia's deputy prime minister for space and defense, told news agencies on Tuesday that he would not support a U.S. and European proposal to extend the space station beyond 2020.

Rescue team members arrive as the Russian Soyuz TMA-11M space capsule rests on the ground . Rogozin, who is among 11 Russian officials sanctioned by the United States, also said he would ban the sale of Russian-made rocket engines, which are used to launch U.S. military satellites. United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, use the Russian-made RD-180 engines to power the first stage of its Atlas 5 rockets. Apparently exempt from Rogozin's ban are Soyuz flight services, now the only means of taking crew to the space station following the retirement of U.S. space shuttles in 2011. NASA pays Russia more than $60 million per person to fly its astronauts on Soyuz capsules and is expected to continue to do so until at least 2017. NASA said it had not yet received any official notification from Russia on changes in space cooperation. 'Space cooperation has been a hallmark of U.S.-Russia relations, including during the height of the Cold War, and most notably, in the past 13 consecutive years of continuous human presence on board the International Space Station,' it said in a statement. 'Ongoing operations on the ISS continue on a normal basis.' NASA, which aims to break the Russian monopoly on crew flight services by 2017, is reviewing proposals from at least three U.S. firms to develop a commercial space taxi.

"By . Katy Winter . Art teacher Ashley Crane is a picture of beauty as a Miss England contestant, but her modelling career only came about after her rugby dream was cut short. The 22-year-old self-confessed tomboy, who has just been crowned Miss Surrey, was tipped as a future star of the women's game until a serious shoulder injury forced her to quit. The stunning 6ft blonde had dreamed of sporting fame after being discovered at university and even played in a Dubai 7s tournament. After turning out for the first team at Loughborough University Ashley, pictured here playing rugby, was tipped to become one of the greats of the game . Following her shoulder injury on the pitch, friends persuaded a reluctant Ashley to compete for Miss Surrey and she was shocked to walk away with the crown . But last week Ashley, who now works as a teacher at St John's School in Leatherhead, Surrey, swapped her rugby boots for stilettos as she entered her first beauty pageant - and walked away with the Miss Surrey crown. The title puts her in the running for the national Miss England contest next month - and if she wins that, she would be in the running for Miss World. Ashley, from Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, said: 'It was weird because I was a tomboy and had my head in the game for so long. I thought I had lost my grace. 'I always had the same dress I would chuck on for special events and I'd do my hair. I'd never get glammed up but when you do pageants, you realise how important that is for a girl. 'I loved it from the beginning, you are with all the girls and they were all so chilled out. 'I was over the moon when they called my name at Miss Surrey. I just couldn't believe it. Now I am just buzzing for Miss England, I can't wait. 'There are a few obstacles before the competition - I just have to train well and get the right nutrition.' Last week Ashley, pictured centre after winning her Miss Surrey crown, swapped her rugby boots for stilettos as she entered her first beauty pageant . Ashley started playing rugby when she was 17 - scoring two tries on her debut for a local team. She picked up the sport at Loughborough University and was put into the first team, taking part in the Dubai 7s tournament in summer 2012 as part of a social team. Her side reached the semi-finals where they were beaten by the Kazakhstani national side. But it was Ashley's last tournament as she injured her right shoulder at trials for the Midlands. She faced the choice of spending £6,000 on a private operation or two years on an NHS waiting list, so reluctantly gave up the game. Ashley added: 'When I first started, my mum really didn't want me to play and I didn't realise I had the potential to be good. 'The Dubai 7s massively encouraged me to play professionally. I took so much pride in the fact I was good at what I was doing. Accomplished Ashley, who is currently working as an art teacher, is fundraising for Beauty With A Purpose, a charity that helps children in poverty around the world . 'You get bashed about a lot and you just deal with it. It is an old school mentality of just getting on with it. 'I basically took the tackle and I went down on my shoulder. I thought it was a dead arm at first but it was actually torn tissue. 'It is something that can be repaired with keyhole surgery. I didn't have the money or savings to drop in to and I didn't want to wait around for the surgery. 'The first two months were some of the hardest of my life but then I decided to put it all behind me.' Friends persuaded a reluctant Ashley to take to the catwalk and she she was stunned when she was picked from more than 100 hopefuls to be named Miss Surrey. If she wins the Miss England competition she could be set to win £25,000, a trip to Mauritius and a place in Miss World.

"By . Emily Crane . A mother left paralysed after giving birth has arrived home to find a gleaming $45,000 Nissan Navara complete with a giant red bow parked on her front lawn and a note from an anonymous Good Samaritan. Jessie Bruton, 27, lost feeling in both of her legs after pressure on her spine caused severe nerve damage while she was pregnant with her third son nine months ago. The mother of three found the white Nissan Pathfinder outside her house in Oak Flats, south of Wollongong, last month. Jessie Bruton from Oak Flats lost feeling in both of her legs after she suffered nerve damage while she was pregnant with her third son nine months ago . 'I had a really bad day... I was in heaps of pain. We came home and the car was there. I didn’t think it was for me. We sat around out the front for ages before we checked if it was open,' Mrs Bruton told MailOnline. The generous donor left a card inside the car saying they hoped the gift would make Mrs Bruton smile considering what she has faced. 'My husband Mick was crying, I was crying and my boys were running around trying to find DVDs to put in the car,' she said. 'I stared at it for ages, but when I jumped in I realised it had been converted for me. It was pretty amazing.' The car has been fitted with hand controls and is big enough to accommodate her walking frame, wheelchairs and prams for her young sons - Levi, 7, Nash, 2, and six-month-old Klay. An anonymous donor dropped off a custom-fitted Nissan Pathfinder on the 27-year-old's front lawn last month . 'At first I thought my friend Kylie was behind it because she’s been organising a fundraiser. But I rang a few people and no one knew anything,' Mrs Bruton said. The Bruton's used the hand-over papers in the car to contact the seller but she wouldn’t reveal who the generous buyer was. 'Then I thought they did it out of the kindness of their heart so I shouldn’t dig around to find them if they don’t want me to,' she said. Mrs Bruton said she would be 'forever grateful' and wished she could hug the anonymous donor. 'They have no idea what they’ve given me,' she said. 'Klay was our last baby, we’d bought a house, I'd finished my certificate III in fitness. 'Everything was in place and it turned our world upside down. It’s been really hard to rely on others so much.' The car had been fitted with hand controls and is big enough to accommodate her walking frame, wheelchairs and prams for her young sons Levi, 7, Nash, 2, and six-month-old Klay . Mrs Bruton, who had been driving for 10 years before she was left paralysed, passed her disability driving test on Tuesday. 'My husband and I went and had a coffee last night and I drove him. I felt normal for the first time in 12 months,' she said. Doctors are not sure if Ms Bruton will ever walk again unaided, but the former fitness instructor said she was doing as much physiotherapy as possible to help. Mrs Burton, her husband and three boys had to move back in with her parents while they raise money to modify their family home. Her friends have organised a fundraiser at Wests Illawarra Leagues Club on Friday night. For more information, visit jessiebruton.eventbrite.com.au.

"By . Louise Cheer . Growing up to 40cm in length, super-sized goldfish are lurking in Western Australian waterways. They are among the invasive feral fish of the Vasse River, south of Perth, with some growing to a massive 2kg after preying on native species. A pet goldfish normally grows to about 5cm in length. Dr Stephen Beatty holds up one of the goldfish that has spread to the Wilyabrup Brook that flows between Cape Naturaliste and Cape Leeuwin near Perth. One of the giant goldfish pulled from Perth's Vasse River. Some of them can measure up to 40cm and weigh 2kg . After being released into the wild by owners, the goldfish grow to super-size by gorging on native fish eggs and stir up algae blooms while they feed on the bottom of rivers. It seems the mutant goldfish have also spread to the Wilyabrup Brook, near Busselton, in Western Australia. But the brook is part of a different river system to the Vasse - the home of the world's fastest growing goldfish. There are fears the fish could spread further with some highly tolerant of salt water. A research fellow at Murdoch University's School of Veterinary and Life Sciences in Perth has helped to remove more than 1600 of the giant goldfish in the past decade and has been monitoring the growth rate of others. The average size of a pet goldfish is about 5cm, eight times smaller than the giant ones found in the Vasse River . 'They can grow up to 18cm in the first year, which is quite incredible,' Dr Stephen Beatty said. More... Argghh, it's alive! Brisbane Council worker shortchanged at the parking meter after finding a SNAKE hidden inside . Where sharks go to die: Researchers find unique 'underwater graveyard' of giant fish . The goldfish is just one of the feral fish species entering the south-west waterways where alien species are outnumbering local fish for the first time. About 80 percent of the fish introduced into Vasse River are aquarium species, usually kept as pets, thought to be released by owners. To track the movements of the goldfish, Dr Beatty and his colleagues implanted 21 of them with smaller replicas of acoustic tags normally used on great white sharks. The team also installed listening posts along the river similar to the ones used to find out when the predator is near a beach. It was part of a study they were doing last summer, the results of which will be published soon. The scientists also found the fish's breeding ground was in a wetland part of the Vasse. As part of their studies, Murdoch University scientists implanted 21 feral goldfish with smaller versions of tracking tags used on great white sharks . Goldfish normally live in freshwater. Dr Beatty said the study was useful because it would help find preventative measures to keep alien species from crossing into other waterways.","Goldfish up to 40cm in length and weigh 2kg found near Perth .

"By . Wills Robinson . Kathryn Smith, 25, was sacked as a 999 call handler after leaking information during the hunt for one-eyed murderer Dale Cregan . A 999 call handler has been sacked for sharing the identity of a neighbour who tipped off police during the manhunt for Dale Cregan. Kathryn Smith, 25, from Droylsden, Manchester, gave her boyfriend, a 'childhood friend' of the murderer, the name of a man who alerted police about a suspicious car parked outside the home of Cregan’s mother Anita. The one-eyed-fugitive was . wanted wanted for two gangland murders at the time and later shot dead WPCs Fiona Bone, . 32, and Nicola Hughes, 23. Now 30, he is serving four whole life sentences for the murders. The unnamed neighbour was later confronted by Mrs Cregan, 56, about his call and was ‘questioned’ for six hours. He was subsequently warned his life might be at risk. Smith, whose father is a police inspector, later stood trial charged of misconduct in a public office after she was accused of helping the Cregan family during the manhunt. But she was acquitted in February after claiming the confidential information had been leaked as part of 'lovers’ tittle tattle' and didn’t realise the information would be passed on. Mrs Cregan and neighbour Sean Booth, 31, who at the time was Smith’s boyfriend, was cleared of aiding and abetting charges. Today Greater Manchester Police said Smith had been dismissed from her job fielding 999 calls at a police communications room at Chester House, near Manchester United’s Old Trafford football ground. She is appealing against the decision. A spokesman said: 'While the court found no criminal offences took place, the actions of the staff member in disclosing confidential police information and compromising a member of the public, who had the right to expect that information to be kept secure, clearly fell far below the standards we expect from our staff. ‘As a result, the staff member was dismissed from Greater Manchester Police. We can confirm an appeal against the dismissal has been lodged. During Smith’s trial at Manchester Crown Court earlier this year, the jury was told she used the force computer to look up incidents central to the hunt for Cregan. He had shot Mark Short, 23, in a pub in May 2012 then killed Short’s father David, 46, in a gun and grenade attack the following August. She also looked up details of police . operations, including the identity of the armed officers on patrol in . the area where Cregan was thought to be at large. Smith told her boyfriend Sean Booth, 31, the name of a neighbour who alerted police of a suspicious car outside Anita Cregan's home (right). Her son (left) was wanted for the murder of two police officers at the time . The court also heard Booth was a childhood friend of Cregan and was 'like a brother' to him. The investigation into Smith began after a caller rang police reporting a 'suspicious' car outside Mrs Cregan’s home. Minutes after the tip-off there was a raid on Mrs Cregan's home involving dozens of officers, with firearms warrant, dogs, and a helicopter. At the time the property was being bugged by police who were manning a listening post ‘up to 24 hours a day’ Smith, pictured outside Manchester Crown Court earlier this year, said she often spoke about her work with Booth, but 'trusted' he would not share it . In . recordings, Mrs Cregan was heard to talk about where the tip off came . from and said: 'I’m really not the type of person who can sit on that.’ Cregan, now 30, is currently serving four life sentences for murder . Later . she was heard saying: 'I have just text somebody saying we have got a grass . in the street, asked him who it was and he found out today, can you . believe it?' The vehicle’s owner, Cregan’s sister Kelly, was arrested, but later released without charge. 'The two policewomen were killed in September 2012 after Cregan made a hoax emergency call to the police. When they arrived, Cregan shot them and threw an M75 hand grenade at them. Both officers were hit by at least eight bullets as Cregan fired 32 shots in 31 seconds. He later handed himself in at a police station, admitting to killing Hughes and Bone. Later when Smith was confronted about her use of the force computer she claimed she was looking at it out of 'nosiness' and insisted there was 'nothing sinister.' She said she didn’t know Mrs Cregan but had been introduced to Cregan himself once by Booth in a pub and 'didn’t like him'. She claimed she often talked about her work with Booth and 'trusted' he would not share it with anyone else. Booth admitted passing on the information but claimed he did it because he believed neighbours ‘had it in’ for Mrs Cregan.","Kathryn Smith, 25, was sacked after leaking information to her boyfriend .

"By . Tania Steere . Motorways are becoming so congested that motorists should get used to driving at 40mph, according to the civil servant in charge of Britain’s roads. Graham Dalton, the chief executive of the Highways Agency, said roads are getting ‘slower and slower’, and suggested there was now an unofficial target of 40mph during busy periods. Mr Dalton, who has been the agency’s chief executive for the past six years, said motorway speeds were ‘getting more predictable, but slower and slower’ and this ‘is not acceptable’. Graham Dalton, the chief executive of the Highways Agency, said roads are getting 'slower and slower' He told Civil Service World magazine: ‘If you’re driving down the M6 to come to work in Birmingham every morning, we’ve got to the point where 50mph or 40mph is acceptable, and the target is to make it 40mph every weekday morning.’ The Agency is in charge of maintaining 4,300 miles of England’s motorways and A roads. Four million vehicles use the roads daily. Shadow Environment Secretary Mary Creagh says people will be shocked to hear that 40 mph is the best drivers can hope for on some motorways . Mary Creagh, the shadow Transport secretary, told the Telegraph: ‘People will be shocked to hear that 40 mph is the best drivers can hope for and shocked by ministers’ complacency. ‘We need a national plan for our road and rail networks so they can support the jobs and growth our country needs. ‘This startling admission is an indictment of this Government’s decision to slash spending on our motorways and cancel many road projects that would have tackled congestion and increased speed and reliability on our motorways.’ Britain is ranked 24th in the world for its roads behind many other developed countries such as France, according to the magazine. A Highways Agency spokesman said: ‘There is no target for managing average motorway traffic flows at speeds below 70mph. ‘The Highways Agency has been successful in making journeys more reliable and predictable – now we need to make them quicker as well.’ Officials said that an example of this was the agency’s ‘smart motorways programme, which adds an extra lane, with the default speed limit of 70mph’.","Chief executive of Highways Agency says motorway are becoming slower .

"By . Jennifer Newton . This is the shocking moment two men appeared to smoke crystal meth in the middle of the day while travelling on a tram in Manchester. A commuter, who does not wish to be named, took the picture of the pair while on an East Didsbury-bound Metrolink tram on Monday evening. The two youths, who appear to be in their teens, got on the tram before Central Park and stayed on past St Peter's Square in Manchester city centre. The two youths on the Manchester tram, who appear to be smoking crystal meth . The picture was taken as the tram stopped outside the headquarters of Greater Manchester Police in the Newton Heath area. The commuter said: ‘I could see white smoke coming out of a plastic coke bottle and something was bubbling away in there. ‘I'm not sure what it was but something was bubbling away in there. It looked like what I've seen on Breaking Bad, it wasn't an electric cigarette that's for sure.’ ‘I tried to take the picture discreetly. I wasn't sure what to do because I didn't know if I called the police or said something to them if they might attack me,’ she added. Methamphetamine, also known as crystal meth, is a class A drug often compared to crack cocaine because it is also smoked and is highly addictive. After taking the picture, the commuter on the tram then posted the image to Twitter, alerting Greater Manchester Police’s city centre Twitter account, but it took them 40 minutes to respond. When they did, they told the woman to phone the non-emergency hotline number 101 if she saw it happening again. They tweeted: ‘""@MCRMetrolink Just seen this. If you witness again can you call straight away on 101. Will try intercept"". The commuter, who took the picture, alerted Greater Manchester Police via Twitter but got this reply . The commuter, who travels from Salford to Oldham every day for work, then replied: ""@GMPCityCentre @MCRMetrolink will do, didn't think about the 101 number. Not sure how they would have took it as I was near them"". A spokesman from Metrolink, who operate Manchester’s trams, said they were happy for people to report problems via Twitter and said they would have responded if the incident had occurred during their office hours, which they are looking to extend. A spokesman said: ""If the claims being made are proved to be accurate, it's criminal behaviour that has absolutely no place on the network. We will review CCTV footage from the tram and at stops that, together with the picture tweeted, should help police to take action. ‘Our drivers and staff are encouraged to report any anti-social behaviour they witness to build intelligence so that we can work with the police to target areas as required. ‘Incidents like this are incredibly rare. To keep it that way, passengers should report any criminal incidents direct to the police as matter of urgency, and contact our customer services team on 0161 205 2000 so we can support any action required as quickly and effectively as possible. 'Passengers can also use the help points at stops to pass information on.’","Two young men appear to be smoking crystal meth on a Manchester tram .

"By . James Salmon . and Hugo Duncan . and Becky Barrow . Mortgage approvals have fallen by a fifth since tougher checks were introduced less than three weeks ago . Mortgage approvals have fallen by a fifth since tougher checks were introduced less than three weeks ago, according to one of the UK’s biggest lenders. The startling figure - disclosed to the Mail - is the first sign that more borrowers are being rejected for home loans since the new rules were enforced on April 26. There are growing fears that mortgages will soon become more expensive and harder to qualify for. The Bank of England is today expected to indicate interest rates are likely to rise within the next 12 months – possibly before the end of the year. The prospect of an interest rate rise comes as the Financial Ombudsman Service will today warn record numbers of people are struggling with their mortgage. Nearly 13,700 people contacted the service last year for help with their mortgage or another secured loan, which is the largest-ever number. Many are in a state of ‘debt denial’, which means they refuse to deal with the problem until it is too late. Lasting up to three hours, the stricter vetting is designed to prevent a return to the reckless lending which contributed to the biggest recession in living memory. Applicants are being asked intrusive questions about their finances and personal life, including whether they eat steak or play golf. Some experts are concerned the rules have gone too far and believe a ‘boxing ticking’ approach is freezing out some applicants who can comfortably afford to pay a mortgage. Brokers complain that applications which typically took a month to process are now taking five to six weeks. Some lenders introduced the stricter tests months before the new regime officially came into force. Last night one leading expert said the same lenders asking ‘frankly ridiculous questions’ are routinely failing to ask how much savings an applicant has. This means those who have saved money to pay for extra expenses such as children’s school fees are being rejected, as the lender assumes the fees will have to be deducted from their salary. Ray Boulger from mortgage broker John Charcol described this as the ‘key failure’ of the so-called Mortgage Market Review. He said: ‘On a long term basis, tougher rules mean that there will be clearly be some reduction in the number of people who get approved for mortgages. ‘The key failure in the system is lenders are not taking into account savings. ‘Lenders appear to assume savings are irrelevant and that people will blow all their money on a Lamborghini.’ Applicants are being asked intrusive questions about their finances and personal life, including whether they eat steak or play golf . The concerns will not go unnoticed by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who will today be quizzed about the state of the housing market and the risks of a dangerous new bubble. The Canadian, who has already promised to be ‘vigilant’ about rising house prices, will outline what the central bank can do to prevent an unsustainable boom – including stress tests on the banking system and a clampdown on risky mortgage lending. The Bank is expected to raise its forecasts for the UK economy – paving the way for an early rise in interest rates. The economy is now within a whisker of its pre-recession peak and among the fastest growing in the developed world – undermining the case for record low rates which have been held at 0.5 per cent since March 2009. At the Bank’s last inflation report in February, Mr Carney hinted that rates could rise next spring.But stronger growth and lower unemployment could force the Bank to bring that date forward when it publishes its latest inflation report today. Former Bank of England economist Rob Wood, who now works at Berenberg Bank, said the Bank is likely to ‘admit that a rate hike is coming sooner rather than later’. He said: ‘Record low interest rates are increasingly unnecessary.’ Some analysts believe rates could rise as soon as November this year. Andrew Sentance, a former member of the monetary policy committee that sets interest rates, called on the Bank to ‘prepare the ground for a rise in interest rates later this year’. He added: ‘You can only make gradual and limited interest rate rises if you make them in good time. If you delay you then have to push rates up quite sharply.’ But the figures released from the Ombudsman today reveals the tightrope the Bank of England is walking. They cast doubt on the ability of many families to cope with an increase in interest rate, if they cannot afford their loan when rates are at a rock-bottom level. Tony Boorman, the chief ombudsman, said many of the cases are ‘heart-breaking’ because people face losing their home after becoming overwhelmed by their debts. The Financial Ombudsman Service said many people are ‘unrealistic’ about how much help their lender can give them, such as asking for their mortgage to be written off or their monthly payments to be suspended indefinitely. Of all the cases that come to the service when people say they are in ‘severe financial difficulty’, half involve problems with their mortgage, it said. One of Britain’s biggest housebuilders yesterday said the clampdown on risky mortgage lending will benefit the economy in the long-run. Pete Redfern, chief executive of Taylor Wimpey, said: ‘The UK housing market continues to perform strongly with sales rates and pricing at the upper end of our expectations. We believe that the recent introduction of new regulations is a positive move for the long term health of the market.’","There are growing fears that mortgages will soon become more expensive .

"By . James Rush . Bernard McSorley was jailed for life today at Preston Crown Court after being convicted of murder . A 53-year-old man besotted with a woman 30 years his junior stabbed to death a young love rival who he feared was about to start dating her. Bernard McSorley gave himself the pet name 'Papa Smurf' while he called 23-year-old Lorna Nardone 'Baby Smurf'. But he flew into a jealous rage when he discovered she had developed feelings for father-of-two Paul McDonagh, 30. McSorley stabbed Mr McDonagh in the back with a Stanley knife in Lancaster, saying: 'You're a dead man.' He later told friends: 'He was making a c*** of me - a few more people are going to get slashed.' Mr McDonagh was treated at Lancaster Royal Infirmary and told to see his GP the following week. But he refused to stay in hospital for further assesssment and was found dead five days later. Tests showed the cause of death was due to shock and internal bleeding due to the stab wound to his back. Police who caught up with McSorley discovered he had previously served a prison sentence for attempted murder after attacking an ex-partner with an axe. He was jailed for life today at Preston Crown Court after being convicted of murder. He must serve a minimum of 25 years in jail before being considered for parole. The victim, a keen guitarist nicknamed 'Hightower' due to his 6ft7in frame, had moved to Lancaster from Maidstone after his partner was found to have a muscle degenerative disease and wanted to be closer to her family. He met McSorley at a community centre in the city in October last year and they began feuding over Miss Nardone. McSorley flew into a jealous rage when he discovered Lorna Nardone had developed feelings for father-of-two Paul McDonagh (pictured) Paul Reid QC prosecuting said: 'The attack appears to have been motivated by McSorley’s jealousy towards Paul McDonagh. 'McSorley had developed feelings for a much younger woman, Lorna Nardone, but she did not reciprocate those feelings and had feelings for Paul McDonagh.’ On the morning of the stabbing, Miss Nardone, Mr McDonagh and another man were at Lancaster bus station when they saw McSorley. When McSorley saw McDonagh and Miss Nardone together, he shouted 'you’re going to get it.' Later that day, McSorley was seen running towards where Mr McDonagh was sitting behind TK Maxx. Eye witnesses described seeing McSorley remove his jacket and shirt and place them on a nearby bench before running at Mr McDonagh, who was sitting on steps talking to a friend. The killer then walked away and dumped the Stanley knife down a drain. Mr McDonagh, a keen guitarist nicknamed 'Hightower' due to his 6ft7in frame, had moved to Lancaster from Maidstone after his partner was found to have a muscle degenerative disease and wanted to be closer to her family . Mark Chapman, who was with both men at the time of the attack, told the court: 'He was pretty angry. I think he was showing off. He said a few more people are going to get slashed.' McSorley later claimed he was acting in self defence, saying he bought a knife from a pound shop when he was advised to 'watch his back' when he heard Mr McDonagh was looking for him. He denied murder but a jury took just one hour and 25 minutes to convict him. During the trial Miss Nardone gave evidence telling how she and McSorley referred to each other as 'Papa Smurf' and 'Baby Smurf.' When quizzed by Mr Reid about McSorley's feelings for her, she grew agitated and shouted: 'That’s Papa Smurf, he shouldn’t be in prison for murder, I know that for a fact.' In a statement Mr McDonagh’s partner . Denise Daniel said: 'He was an amazing dad. He used to do the school . run, cooking, cleaning, he was pretty much a full time dad because I was . finding things difficult, my disease means I’m different from one day . to the next. McSorley was seen running towards where Mr McDonagh was sitting behind TK Maxx . 'He was creative, very artistic, his passion was music and he played the guitar and wrote songs. He was 6ft 7in, and people called him a gentle giant who would do anything for anybody.' Detective Sergeant Mark Haworth-Oates, of Lancashire Constabulary’s Force Major Investigation Team, said: 'This was a particularly brutal and cowardly attack on a man who was posing no threat and who had no warning or opportunity to defend himself. 'McSorley stabbed Paul in a town centre street, busy with shoppers, in the middle of the day in an attack fuelled by the defendant’s jealousy. 'As the Judge stated in sentencing, the defendant has not shown an ounce of remorse and this is reflected in the sentence that has been imposed. 'The verdict and sentence will hopefully allow the family of Paul to begin to move on with their lives knowing that justice has been done and our thoughts remain with them and with Paul’s friends.'","Bernard McSorley jailed for at least 25 years after being convicted of murder .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Banned: Joanna Shuter, former head of Quintin Kynaston in north London, has been barred from teaching for life . A disgraced headteacher has been banned for life from the classroom after spending more than £30,000 of public money on lavish parties taxis and mobile phone bills. Joanna Shuter, who was once named headteacher of the year and awarded a CBE, used £6,292,20 of funds for Quintin Kynaston School in north London to pay for her own 50th birthday party. She claimed another £5,855.67 for taxis, as well as £8,269 for an overnight stay at the Grove Hotel, Hertfordshire. Her children's mobile phone bills were also charged back to the school. Today, Ms Shuter, 53, was found guilty of 'unacceptable professional conduct' while working at Quintin Kynaston School in north London - and banned from teaching indefinitely. A judgment approved by the Education Secretary also barred her from applying to lift the order at a later date. Ms Shuter, who was awarded a CBE in 2010 for services to teaching, resigned from her post a the school in St John's Wood last year while the government launched a probe. It found she had used school funds for 'inappropriate purposes'. It emerged Ms Shuter bought furniture worth £1,500 that was delivered to her home. She also claimed on expenses for posh dinners, personal taxi rides and nearly £3,500 in flowers. Today's judgement issued by a . professional conduct panel found that she had been a 'force for good' in . many respects - but that her expenses claims 'undermined' the entire . teaching profession. The . staggering bill for her 50th birthday party in 2011 included money spent . on catering, alcohol, food, party lights and 'landscaping' - as well as . extra pay for the staff's time. That money was not paid back for more . than a year. Ms Shuter admitted the allegations, the judgement says. Ms Shuter, pictured meeting the Queen in 2007 to receive a CBE for services to education, resigned last year . The panel said her 'unacceptable' claims at Quintin Kynaston 'undermined' the entire profession . She also admitted taking on paid work for speaking at conferences and consultancy during term time. Her personal assistant was instructed to carry out non-school related tasks such as organising her public speaking engagements, booking flights for her family and arranging the rental of her holiday home. The panel said: 'In light of the panel’s findings against Ms Shuter, which involved making numerous and extensive expenses claims in respect of public money, over a significant period of time for personal gain, there is a strong public interest consideration in maintaining public confidence in the profession. 'This is particularly so in Ms Shuter’s . case, in light of her high national profile as an influential figure in . the education world and public recognition as Headteacher of the Year . and her receipt of a CBE. 'This high profile increases the risk of public . confidence in the profession being undermined. Ms Shuter, who has previously been named as headteacher of the year, spent nearly £3,500 on flowers . Ms Shuter cannot apply to lift the life ban as she showed 'a lack of insight into the severity of her behaviours' 'The Panel is also of the view that in the climate of recent years, the public interest in maintaining public confidence in the management of public finances, including ensuring that expenses claims against public funds are appropriate, is particularly strong. 'Accordingly, the Panel considers that public confidence in the profession could be seriously weakened if conduct such as that found against Ms Shuter were not treated with the utmost seriousness when regulating the conduct of the profession.' It added that while Ms Shuter had admitted her wrongdoing she had also showed 'a lack of insight into the severity and impact of her behaviours'. The document says that in respect of the birthday party, Ms Shuter set up separate accounting for them but failed to reimburse the school until she repaid £5,906.98 in April 2012 - more than a year after receiving an invoice for it.","Joanna Shuter admitted spending more than £30,000 on personal expenses .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . The M25 could be expanded to an unprecedented 14 lanes in a tunnel underneath a third runway at Heathrow, as part of a radical new plan, it emerged yesterday. The airport unveiled its controversial expansion proposal in a submission to the Government's aviation commission - as it battles to fend off growing competition from its rival Gatwick. It is thought that a 600 metre, 14 lane tunnel would replace an existing part of the M25 and would pass under a third runway. The airport claim it would be built without any disruption to the current motorway. Scroll down for video . Heathrow bosses released the airport's new proposal for a third runway - with a series of striking computer generated designs of what it will look like in 2025, including this one (above) Bosses at Britain's busiest airport claim that only Heathrow can rival other 'hub' airports around the world. They released this image (above) of what a new runway to the south of the airport would look like from above . Britain's second busiest airport, Gatwick, has put forward its plan for a second runway in a bid to challenge Heathrow's dominance. It released this image (above) of what a two-runway Gatwick would look like from the air . The Govermnent is considering three options to ease the growing pressure on London's airports. Option one would see a third runway built at Heathrow - costing £15.6billion. But taxpayers would be asked to spend an extra £1.2billion for a tunnel under the M25 as well as extra lanes on the motorway near the airport. Heathrow claims the extra runway would be up and running by 2025. A second Heathrow plan calls for an existing runway to be extended to allow more flights. But Britain's second busiest airport, Gatwick, has urged the Government to ditch Heathrow from its plans. It says a second runway at the airport would be cheaper - at £7.8billion - and would not need any Government subsidy. Boris Johnson has urged the Government commission to add a giant four-runway Thames Estuary airport to its shortlist, but this is likely to be rejected. A final recommendation on Britain's next runway will be made after the 2015 general election. But London Mayor Boris Johnson dismissed . both airport's plans. His chief airport adviser said Heathrow's bid was 'lunacy' while Gatwick's bid for a second runway was a 'humongous red herring'. Under Heathrow's £15.6billion proposal, which needs a £1.2billion taxpayer-funded Government top up, the airport would build a third runway by 2025. It claims the new runway would boost the UK economy by £100billion and create 100,000 jobs. A third runway would take the number of annual flights out of Heathrow up from the current 472,000 to 740,000 - with 40 new daily routes around the world. But to make the runway possible, a new 600 metre tunnel will be needed on the M25. The motorway will also need to be widened to seven lanes in each direction. This would turn the motorway into a giant 14 lanes on the stretch between junctions 14 and 15 near Heathrow. The airport's chiefs today insisted that this work, taking three to four years to complete, could be done without having to close part of the motorway. But a rival bid by Gatwick claims it could add a second runway for less money - and without any taxpayer top up. The £7.8 billion Gatwick plan would see a second runway built at the West Sussex airport, creating 120,000 new jobs. Initial plans by both airports made it onto a shortlist chosen by the Government's Airports Commission looking into the best way to boost the number of flights in and out of Britain. A final recommendation will be published in 2015 - after the next election. Motorists are often forced to endure heavy traffic on the M25 near Heathrow Airport and could be expected to suffer further queues if a third runway is built . Also on the short list is a rival Heathrow scheme to extend the existing northern runway to at least 6,000 metres. Gatwick bosses said its second-runway plan will allow 10 million more passengers each year to able to travel. They also claim that it can be built about five years earlier than a third runway at Heathrow at no additional cost or risk to the taxpayer; . Far fewer people will be affected by noise as well, they claim - a second runway at Gatwick would have an impact on only 14,000 people compared with the 240,000 people impacted by noise from Heathrow today. John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow's development director and chief executive designate, said: 'Expansion at Heathrow matters to the whole country. Boris Johnson has campaigned against expanding Heathrow or Gatwick - in favour of a giant new four-runway hub airport in the Thames Estuary . 'Only Heathrow will connect all of the UK to fast-growing international markets. The plans we are submitting to the Airports Commission demonstrate major economic benefits from a third runway for the whole of the UK.' He added: 'Our plans are deliverable. Heathrow offers the fastest, most cost effective and practical route to connect the whole of the UK to growth and we have proven our ability to deliver a world-class hub that will make Britain proud.' But Stewart Wingate, Gatwick's chief executive, said: 'As we reach this critical point in the aviation debate it is clear that the Airports Commission has a very real choice to make - expand Gatwick and create genuine competition in the market with lower fares for everyone, or move back to a London airport market dominated by a single player and saddle the next generation with higher air fares. 'Why would you choose to fly a quarter of a million more planes every year over one of the world's most densely populated cities when instead you can fly them mostly over fields? 'Why tunnel part of the busiest motorway in Europe - the M25 - causing serious traffic disruption, when you can build on land already set aside for expansion? The choice is an obvious one. Expand the best and only deliverable option - Gatwick - and create a market that serves everyone.' The option of a new airport in the Thames Estuary - the so-called 'Boris Island' scheme favoured by London's Mayor Boris Johnson - did not make the shortlist drawn up by the commission which is headed by former Financial Services Authority chief Sir Howard Davies. But the commission is still studying the scheme and is expected to make a decision later this year on whether the project should be taken forward. Mr Johnson's chief aviation adviser Daniel Moylan said: 'It is lunacy to suggest that any plan to build a third runway will reduce noise levels at Heathrow. And their owners must think we were born yesterday if they expect us to believe they have experienced a fit of conscience that has resulted in a new commitment to the wider regions of the UK. 'A third runway will not restore the 11 regional routes axed at Heathrow since 1990 as peak slots will be dominated by the most profitable long-haul flights. Their claim to be the only deliverable plan on the table is patently untrue and their proposals to encourage more passengers to use public transport are based on false assumptions. Put simply their arguments are all hot air.' He added: 'A new hub airport in the inner estuary could be built for the same cost as a four-runway Heathrow, and would bring new jobs, homes, and long term competitiveness to the east, while simultaneously opening up the largest potential site for new homes and jobs in London to the west. 'It is the only credible option and the only one that portrays a compelling vision for this country's claim to be the natural economic capital of Europe.' Mr Moylan said that building a new runway at Gatwick airport was 'a humongous red herring'.","Airport wants to add third runway to keep pace with global rivals .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Claims: Police constable Robert Baillie is accused of failing to arrest a suspect, with his ex-wife reporting the allegations to his superiors . A love cheat policeman has appeared in court after the wife he left for a younger woman reported him for failing to arrest a suspect because he was a family friend. A court heard that Tammy Baillie tipped off her husband Robert's superiors, telling them he had seen suspect Alexander Bett and although a warrant had been issued, failed to arrest him. Robert Baillie, 37, an officer in Cumbernauld, near Glasgow, is also accused willfully neglecting his duties by not telling senior officers that he knew Mr Bett, 29. Airdrie Sheriff Court heard how a probe into Baillie's conduct was launched when Mrs Baillie, who says she was 'devastated' when her husband left her for a younger woman two years ago, reported him for not arresting Bett. The court was told that mother-of-two Mrs Baillie claimed her ex had come home from his first day on duty in April 2010 and revealed that he had been asked to apprehend Bett after a sheriff had granted a . warrant for his arrest. 'He told me his first job was an outstanding warrant for Alex Bett,' she said. 'He said he chapped his door and did not tell his partner that he knew the family. 'Alex’s mum answered the door and was told Alex didn’t live there any more. 'Robert said he didn’t think she recognised him because he didn’t have glasses on and was in his uniform.' Mrs Baillie, a civil servant, told . the court she had been with her husband when they later encountered Mr Bett . when out in Cumbernauld - but the police officer had failed to act. 'They said a passing hello to each other and just after that I asked him if the warrant was still outstanding,' she said. 'He said it was but then said that even though he was off duty, he should do something about it.' Mrs Baillie refuted a suggestion from Shelagh McCall QC, defending, that she was a woman ‘scorned’ who was seeking revenge on her husband for leaving her in January 2012. The court heard he had since fathered a child with his new partner. Mrs McCall said: 'Is it not the case that when you found out about your husband’s affair, you were angry and you then threatened to ruin him? Former love: Tammy Baillie (pictured wearing sunglasses as she left court) said she was 'devastated' when he left her, but denied she was seeking revenge . 'You told him you would finish him and he would be stacking shelves in Tesco. 'You received a letter filing for divorce and that is what motivated you to make a complaint to police about him, and it is that that motivated you to lie about this knowledge that he did not tell his partner about Alex Bett.' Mrs Baillie said: 'No, I am telling the truth. Tammy Baillie, pictured, told the court: 'I was devastated and upset my marriage had broken down but that had nothing to do with this, he was not acting the way a serving police officer should' 'I was devastated and upset my marriage had broken down but that had nothing to do with this, he was not acting the way a serving police officer should.' The trial also heard Amanda Coughlan, 34, Mrs Baillie’s sister, deny defence claims she had lied to back up her sibling’s story. Miss McCall asked her: 'You were at the Basement night club in Cumbernauld and had had a bit to . drink, you then went up to a police officer on duty outside and said to him, ""my sister has got Robert Baillie by the balls and if any of you try to get involved you will be going down too”.' Ms Coughlan replied: 'I do not remember saying that, in fact I couldn’t tell you if I was there or not, but I wouldn’t like to think I would say something like that.' Baillie denies that between June and October 2010 at Cumbernauld Police Office and elsewhere, he wilfully neglected his duty by failing to execute when required any warrant endorsed by a sheriff relating to criminal proceedings. He also denies wilfully neglecting his duty and violating the trust and duty of his office as a constable, failing to execute a warrant for the arrest of Alexander Bett, and failing to tell his supervising officer that he knew Bett, and he had seen him on at least one occasion in Cumbernauld. The trial before Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has been adjourned until Friday.

"By . Riath Al-Samarrai . Follow @@riathalsam . It may all end in tears, but there is enough of Paul Gascoigne in Ross Barkley to suggest it is right for England to give youth a chance at this year’s World Cup. That is the view of Gary Lineker, who thinks the touch and confidence to try the audacious has seemingly passed from the man who lit up Italia 90 to a 20-year-old who is one of England’s brightest hopes heading to Brazil. Lineker is convinced the youthful combination of Barkley, Adam Lallana and particularly Raheem Sterling represents England’s best hope of surviving Group D. Similarities: Gary Lineker can see a little bit of Paul Gasocigne in England frontman Ross Barkley (pictured) Gifted: Gazza's audacious skills and talent lit up Italia 90 when England reached the World Cup semi-finals . Have a word with him: Lineker was on hand after a tearful Gazza had been booked a would be suspended should England get to the World Cup final in 1990 . Could all end in tears: Lineker's signal to England boss Bobby Robson to speak with Gazza is an iconic moment in England's World Cup history . The striker who scored 48 goals for his country said: ‘I think a good percentage of them will start. I think he (Roy Hodgson) knows that’s his best chance, rather than trying the ones that have been there, seen that, done it. ‘I see things in Barkley’s game, in terms of strengths and weaknesses. Like Gazza he can go past people. He’s incredibly strong. He’s got a similar stature, got amazing ability and will score amazing goals like Gazza. ‘On the defensive side he’s slightly lacking in terms of tactical nous, but if you play him in a certain position that wouldn’t necessarily be that important. I’m not going to say Barkley’s the next Gazza, but I think there are two or three (who could take a World Cup by storm like Gazza).’ While Barkley has excelled from central positions, it is Sterling, magnificently effective across Liverpool’s attack, who has most grabbed Lineker’s attention. Mersey duo: Barkley has performed well for Everton while Raheem Sterling has impressed at Liverpool (left) The 19-year-old has won only two caps - only Luke Shaw of the 20 outfield players in the squad has fewer - but his versatility and form excite Lineker. ‘Sterling is a phenomenal talent,’ he said. ‘He’s probably the best of the youngsters. He looks slightly ahead of Barkley in terms of consistency, and his ability to play in a number of positions is incredible for one so inexperienced. ‘Lallana is a beautiful footballer. He lacks a bit of pace but he is wonderfully gifted with both feet and he keeps the ball well. Daniel Sturridge could also comfortably emerge and become a star.’ Only six of the squad have experienced a World Cup, but Lineker, who believes reaching the quarter-finals ‘would be a pretty good effort’, said: ‘We’ve got exciting young players not stained by  previous tournaments.’ Wonderfully gifted: Lineker described Southampton midfielder Adam Lallana as a beautiful footballer .","Gary Lineker can see a little bit of Paul Gascoigne in Ross Barkley .

"By . Mark Duell . Father of three: Roy Tomlinson spotted the iPhone on the floor near where the young patient was sitting . A callous hospital cleaner has been spared jail and fined just £350 after he stole an iPhone from a young cancer patient who had just finished a course of radiotherapy. Father-of-three Roy Tomlinson, 46, of Aspley, Nottingham, spotted the iPhone on the floor near where Nathan Read was sitting. After swiping the phone at Nottingham City Hospital he was unable to get it to work - and dumped the device in a public toilet. Mr Read, 22, realised his phone had gone missing while he waited outside the hospital in January, Nottingham Magistrates’ Court was told. He reported the theft to hospital security staff - who scrolled through CCTV footage and spotted Tomlinson bending down next to his victim. Mr Read also used an app on his phone to track it down to the same street where Tomlinson lived. After he told police Tomlinson, who had worked at the hospital for 26 years, was arrested and charged. He admitted one count of theft last month and was yesterday ordered to pay £349.99 compensation and £85 court costs. The court heard that Tomlinson had dumped the phone in the cistern of a public toilet after he was unable to unlock it. Tomlinson, who represented himself, . refused to comment on the incident when asked by magistrates - and did . not say anything outside court. Threw it away: Tomlinson could not get the device to work after swiping it at Nottingham City Hospital (pictured) Probation officer John Davies told the court the defendant had mental health issues and ‘felt remorse’. He added: ‘On this day, his life seems to have overwhelmed him. ‘He recently heard about the death of a colleague, there were difficulties at home, he was upset his daughter was suffering from health problems. With his anxiety, things became too much for him. ‘He couldn’t explain why he took the phone. He did not know who [it] belonged to. The following day he tried to retrieve the phone and realised it was already recovered. He said he panicked.’","Roy Tomlinson spotted it on floor near where Nathan Read was sitting .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Predatory: Paedophile Gavin Shaw, 54, has been jailed again after he tricked his way into shop jobs so he could meet children . A predatory paedophile whose identity police once tried to keep a secret has been jailed again after he tricked his way into shop jobs so he could meet children. Gavin Shaw, 54, was arrested after he ignored a ruling banning him from mixing with children by moving from town to town, getting jobs in shops so he could meet young customers. While working on a voluntary basis at one shop, Shaw, from Nelson, Lancashire, gave one little girl a toy and money as he sat her on his knee, and later became friendly with a boy. Shaw, who has a history of child abuse spanning almost 40 years, was caught after officers visited him at home during a routine risk assessment and found out about his job. As he was being arrested Shaw began to damage his computer and hurled an illegally held CS gas cannister at police, saying: 'You might as well lock me up for that as well.' It emerged the shopkeeper who gave Shaw a job knew nothing of his background. Burnley Crown Court heard Shaw had convictions for sex offences dating back to 1975 and had been sent to prison seven times. He had previously tricked another shopkeeper into giving him a job in a different town . Four years ago, Shaw was made subject of a ten year Sexual Offences Prevention Order (SOPO) after it emerged he was pretending to be a council officer, dressing up in a high-visibility jacket with his name on it to win the trust of children. At the time police backed a legal application made by Shaw's defence team to keep his identity a secret amid fears he would fall victim to vigilante attacks. The application was turned down when sex abuse victims argued that the public had a right to know about his activities. Background: Burnley Crown Court heard Shaw had convictions for sex offences dating back to 1975 and had been sent to prison seven times . Shaw, . once described as a 'clever child predator', is now starting an 18 . month prison sentence after he admitted breaching the SOPO and . possessing a prohibited weapon for the discharge of noxious liquid or . gas. The court heard he had . convictions for gross indecency, indecent assault and attempted serious . sexual offences, and had previously been sentenced to prison terms of seven years, six years, four years and 41 months. The SOPO was imposed in Shaw’s former hometown of Blackpool in 2010 just weeks after his release from jail when it emerged he had been adding children as young as 12 as friends on his Facebook page. Breach: In 2012 Shaw was arrested again after he was spotted persuading children to get into the back of his van at the seaside resort of Morecambe . At the time police found Shaw with a bag of cuddly toys, which he said were for friends who had children. The . children - all under sixteen - were present when he went to their . homes, leaving parents - who had been friendly with him - 'horrified' when they found out about his background. The order banned Shaw from . working or associating with anyone under 16 unless supervised, with the . prior approval of social services officials. However, . in 2012 Shaw was arrested again after moving 40 miles to Morecambe . where he was spotted persuading youngsters to get into the back of his . van. 1975: Shaw is first convicted for a sexual offence. 2004: According to his defence lawyers, this is the last year Shaw was convicted of molesting a child. 2010: Following his latest release from jail, Shaw is subject to a Sexual Offences Prevention Order after it emerges he has befriended children on Facebook. He is also accused of dressing in a hi-vis jacket to gain children's trust as they think he is a council worker. 2012: Shaw is arrested after moving to Morecambe where he was seen persuading children to get into his van. He is jailed for 16 months in October and on his release the following year moves to Nelson. April 2014: Shaw is arrested for breaching his SOPO . May 2014: Shaw is jailed for 18 months . He had befriended the . children after getting a job at a shop in the seaside resort without . telling his employers about his criminal record. A local support worker, who had some concerns about Shaw, saw three or four children getting into the back of his van and called the police. It emerged he had taken a child to the beach and had bought him a Manchester United money box. as well as taking pictures of him. In October 2012 Shaw was jailed for 16 months, but after his release moved 54 miles to Nelson and got a job at a shop in the town - again keeping his criminal history a secret from his new employer. Although he was not paid, he regularly worked at the shop and would look after it unattended. Charles Brown, prosecuting said: 'The prosecution would say there are elements of grooming in these particular circumstances.' Robert Elias, mitigating, said Shaw had not been convicted of molesting a child for 10 years, and that he had 'moved on' from adolescent boys to gay men. 'He robustly denies having any sexual motive with the two children,' said Mr Elias. 'He didn’t seek them out. They came into the shop when he was there. He does have a human need to seek companionship and friendship. 'He knows and is resigned to a custodial sentence. He doesn’t consider himself to be a threat to children, but that is not the view of the probation service.' Sentencing, Judge Jonathan Gibson said Shaw was assessed as 'high-risk' and told him: 'Court orders are there to be obeyed. 'The sexual offences prevention order is there to protect children.'","Gavin Shaw, 54, ignored ruling banning him from mixing with children .

"By . David Kent . Former Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-Sung announced his retirement from football on Wednesday, bringing the curtain down on a career that took him to the 2002 World Cup semi-finals and saw him become the first Asian to play in a UEFA Champions League final. Park's industry, energy and work ethic made him a favourite of Sir Alex Ferguson during his time at Old Trafford and his performances in England and with Dutch side PSV Eindhoven helped raise the profile of Korean football around the world. The 33-year-old, who called time on his international career after the 2011 Asian Cup, said he could not continue to play at the highest level because of knee issues but added that he was leaving the game without any regrets. Calling it quits: Park Ji Sung has announced his retirement from football due to a knee injury . 'I didn't cry about it yesterday, and I'm not crying about it today, that means I'm leaving with no regrets,' he told a news conference at the Park Ji-sung Football Centre in Suwon, where he has a street named after him. 'I enjoyed playing football. I have achieved more than I have thought I would. I'm truly grateful for all the support I have received and I will live the rest of my life thinking how I can pay it back.' After leaving Manchester United in 2012, Park signed for Queen's Park Rangers but spent the last season on loan at PSV. Issues with his knee sidelined him for long spells over the last two years. 'I thought about getting an operation but even if I did it wouldn't mean the injury would be gone completely. Naturally, retirement was the option,' he added. Park grabbed the spotlight at the 2002 World Cup finals, which were co-hosted by South Korea and Japan. Under the tutelage of Dutch coach Guus Hiddink, the shaggy-haired midfielder flourished on the game's biggest stage, scoring the winning goal against Portugal to seal Korea's place in the knockout stages for the first time. Time to go: Park tells a press conference in South Korea about his decision to quit football . Young fireman: Park as a child growing up in South Korea dressed up in a fireman's hat . Young friends: Park with a young female friend in South Korea . After the World Cup, Hiddink was appointed manager of PSV and brought Park with him, where, after a tough start, he won over the fans and caught the eye of then Manchester United manager Ferguson. Park, described by Ferguson as the 'ultimate professional', spent seven seasons at United, winning four Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2008, though he was surprisingly omitted from the squad for the final. In 2009, he became the first Asian to play in the Champions League final when he started in United's 2-0 loss to Barcelona. Making his name in England: Park played for Manchester United for seven years . National hero: Park won 100 caps for South Korea before retiring from international football in 2011 . 'The proudest moment for me was of course the 2002 World Cup,' said Park, flanked by his father and his mother, who was in tears throughout the news conference. 'The most influential figure in my life is Guus Hiddink. He took me abroad after the World Cup and that was the turning point of my life. 'Ferguson also helped me play at the world's top level... the coaches I've spent time with are definitely my great asset.' Moving on: Park left Manchester United in 2012 and joined QPR but only played there for one season . Park gave himself a 'seven out of 10' for his career and said he would pull on the PSV uniform for the last time on May 28 when the Dutch side visit Korea to play in a charity match as a tribute to the victims of the recent ferry disaster. Park said if he had to choose only one team to play for it would be the national side.'I would choose to wear the national team uniform because it was my lifetime dream to wear it.'","Midfielder calls time on career due to knee problem .

"By . Libby Galvin . Britain's oldest man has died aged 110 years and 63 days, his friends revealed today. The Reverend Reg Dean passed away on Saturday, just two months after celebrating his 110th birthday, according to an announcement by the Dalesmen Male Voice Choir in Derbyshire. He was the choir’s life president, and helped to found the group in the 1980s. The former United Reform Church minister saw 26 prime ministers enter Downing Street, . received seven telegrams from the Queen, survived two world wars and lived to become Britain's oldest man. Celebrations: Reg Dean celebrated his 110th birthday in November last year . Mr Dean, a former Army chaplain and . teacher, was born in Tunstall, Staffordshire, on November 4 1902, just . two years after the death of Queen Victoria. He became Britain’s oldest . man in June 2010 after the death of Stanley Lucas, 110, of Cornwall. During the Second World War, Mr Dean . was stationed in Burma in the Far East. It was during his time in the . Army that he said he found the key to his long life. Three-times married Mr Dean named the source of his longevity as a ‘mysterious brown-looking’ elixir of life given to him by a . doctor when he was an army chaplain in India. 'He said to me, “I have concocted a drink that will make you live for . ever”, or something like that, and would I like to take it?’ he recalled on his 110th birthday in November. ‘Well I’m very naive, I can’t say no, so I drank it and here I am.’ Incredible: Mr Dean outlived the average human male by 32 years and the typical woman by 28 years . When speaking to ITV Central in 2011, Mr Dean said there are three questions everyone should ask themselves. These were 'who am I, why am I here and where am I going?' He admitted that he didn't know the answers to any of them. The Reverend lived through five monarchs. The Wright brothers achieved the first manned flight just after his 1st birthday, and the Titanic sank when he was ten years old. Early years: Reg Dean pictured in 1903 aged 11 months and as a choirboy aged 12 . Growing up: Reg Dean ordained as a minister 1932, left, and in the 1940s during his time with the British Army . Settled life: The minister is snapped smiling in the 1960s, left, and painting in the early 1980s . Reflecting on all he had witnessed . during his life, he said at the time: ‘I remember before the days of . Tarmac, the roads were all dust heaps. ‘I can remember hearing about the sinking of the Titanic when I was at my uncle’s farm.’ The father of one and grandfather of . three returned to England in 1945 and settled in Stratford-on-Avon, before . moving to Derby in 1947. In 1958, Mr Dean became a teacher at Herbert . Strutt School in Belper, where he remained for 10 years. He was also a minister at the United Reformed Churches in Wirksworth and Matlock before retiring 30 years ago aged 80. In the late 1980s Mr Dean helped found the Dalesmen Male Voice Choir and was made life president. The choir marked his 110th birthday . with a performance from more than 200 singers from five male voice . choirs at Derby’s Assembly Rooms. He lived independently until four years ago when he movde to a sheltered . housing complex, and received telegrams from the Queen to mark his . 100th and 105th birthdays and one every year since. The world's oldest living man is Jiroemon Kimura, from Kyotango in Kyoto, Japan, according to a spokeswoman for the Guinness Book of Records. He was was born on April 19, 1897, and is aged 115 years and 263 days. Year by year: Reverend Reg pictured on his 108th and 109th birthdays. He said that he wished to live to be 120 . Honour: Rev.

"By . Damian Spellman, Press Association . Alan Pardew is confident he will get a sympathetic ear from Newcastle owner Mike Ashley as the pair attempt to find a way forward. The two men are meeting this week to carry out a debrief after a difficult season and decide on a summer transfer strategy, although their discussions are far from showdown talks. Both men have come under fire from disgruntled fans in recent weeks, but in the short term at least, there appears to be no prospect of either going anywhere. Pardew knows he has challenging questions to answer after a campaign of two halves, but insists the annual get-together is far from confrontational. Staying on: Alan Pardew will remain as Newcastle's manager for next season after achieving a top 10 finish . Unwanted: Newcastle fans want Pardew sacked after amassing just 16 points in 19 league games for 2014 . He said: 'I think it's important he understands some of the problems I have had. We can talk through some things I think need to improve. 'Although he has a reputation of being aggressive, he's a better listener. That's why he has had such great success. 'He doesn't really say much. He listens and comes back to me, sometimes 48 hours after, and draws some conclusions from what I have said. 'It's not like there's too much hollering and shouting, it's more a case for Mike to listen to the problems I have had. 'Then he reflects on the budget and everything else to see how he can help me.' Let's hear it: Owner Mike Ashley is a good listener, says Pardew . Poor: Newcastle ended the season with a 2-1 defeat at Liverpool thanks to Daniel Sturridge (right) winner . Pardew needs significant help this summer with a replacement for midfielder Yohan Cabaye and a complete rebuild of the striking department the priorities. Cabaye's departure for Paris St Germain in January and the failure to replace him were the central factors in a second-half collapse, and plugging that gap will be key. However it is up front where Pardew, chief scout Graham Carr and newly-appointed managing director Lee Charnley face their biggest challenge. Loic Remy spent last season on loan at St James' Park from QPR and the prospect of securing a permanent deal has receded in recent months. Luuk de Jong joined him from Borussia Monchengladbach in January on a similar basis and failed to make a significant impression, while long-serving Nigeria international Shola Ameobi is out of contract an unlikely to be handed an extension. There will be other vacancies too with Dan Gosling set to join Bournemouth and the likes of Hatem Ben Arfa, Sylvain Marveaux and Gabriel Obertan having become peripheral figures as the season drew to a close. The success or otherwise of the mission to plug those gaps could go a long way towards determining whether or not the Magpies can win over supporters, whose patience has worn critically thin after two transfer windows during which not a single permanent signing was made.","Newcastle finished 10th in the Premier League .

The Northern Irishman was honoured for the first time at the annual awards dinner in London after he led the Reds to second place in the Barclays Premier League, which was the club's highest finish in five years. The award is voted for by all LMA members, including every manager from the top four professional leagues in English football. Unstoppable: Suarez struck 31 goals in 33 games for for Liverpool over a remarkable season . Finish: The striker curls a superb shot past Stoke keeper Jack Butland for one of his strikes in January . Despite their dominantion of the individual awards, Liverpool's season will remain tinged with sadness after losing out to City in the title race. Defender Kolo Toure believes the pain of missing out on a first league title for 24 years will make the Reds players stronger and give them a better chance of ending their drought next season. Toure, who has had to watch from the sidelines for most of the second half of the campaign after making a promising start to his Liverpool career, believes the experience gained this season will be of benefit in the long run. 'I think we did everything we could and at the end City won it,' he said. 'The most important thing was that we have been fighting until the end. 'We will learn from the mistakes we made and next year we will be better. 'Nobody expected us to be where we are but we lacked a little bit of experience and that is why I think we will gain experience. 'We will gain experience by making those mistakes and losing the title like we did. 'I am sure that will give us the strength to better next year.' So close: Liverpool's title chase came up just short, leaving Suarez in tears at Crystal Palace last week . Suarez, meanwhile, was named by by boss Oscar Washington Tabarez in Uruguay's 25-man preliminary World Cup squad on Tuesday alongside Liverpool team-mate Sebastian Coates. Defender Coates was sidelined for almost eight months after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury on international duty last August, but has been on the comeback trail at former club Nacional, whom he joined on loan from the Reds in January . There are three other Premier League players in the squad with Liverpool star Luis Suarez, West Brom defender Diego Lugano and Southampton midfielder Gaston Ramirez included, along with 34-year-old Cerezo Osaka forward Diego Forlan and Paris St Germain's Edinson Cavani in a powerful-looking attack.","Liverpool star Luis Suarez is named Barclays Player of the Season .

The broadcaster yesterday unveiled its team of presenters and pundits who will travel to Brazil to present coverage of one of the world’s biggest sporting event, which is expected to attract millions of viewers per game. Former Daybreak host Adrian Chiles will head a 16-strong team which includes regular ITV pundits Roy Keane and Lee Dixon as well as a host of other former players such as Ian Wright, Glenn Hoddle and Gordon Strachan.

Last week the BBC unveiled its own line-up of presenters and pundits for the World Cup, which includes two women; long-time sports presenter Gabby Logan and Tina Daheley.

'Whenever opportunities arise to bring in new people for ITV Sport, our aim is always to get the best we can.’ During the last World Cup held in South Africa in 2010, ITV employed reporter Kelly Cates to help present its coverage. However, the broadcaster will only take one reporter to this year’s event. On message: The BBC line-up for World Cup 2014 includes Alan Shearer, Rio Ferdinand, Gary Lineker, Thierry Henry, Gabby Logan, and Alan Hansen . Speaking at the launch of ITV’s World Cup team of presenters, Adrian Chiles said of the lack of female reporters: ‘It is a fair point, but the BBC are taking four reporters. We are not taking any because it comes down to cost. ‘If we did have four reporters I am sure we would have a women on the team. But we are not we are taking one who is Gabriel [Clarke] who will be with England. It comes down to numbers. ‘Who are you going to take off our panel? I think it is difficult. If we had a bigger team there would definitely be female involvement. Some of our biggest operators behind the scenes are women. The head count tells a different story. It is not sexist business as far as I am concerned. 'Most of the Albion fans I watch the game with week in week out are women. ‘I don't know if you'd call it a boys club, we have got a lot of our key players behind the scenes are women actually.’","Former Daybreak host Adrian Chiles will .

England's 13-man Twenty20 squad, led by Eoin Morgan in place of the injured Stuart Broad for a one-off match at The Oval next week, is also notable for the return to the shortest format of Ian Bell and the absence of Michael Lumb. Seamers Harry Gurney, who made his international debut in a reduced 50-over match against Scotland last week, and Tim Bresnan - after his late start to the season - are also in both squads.

"By . Jonny Singer . Italy legend Paolo Maldini says he doesn't understand Roy Hodgson's decision to leave Ashley Cole out of England’s World Cup squad. The former AC Milan defender, who played until the age of 40, called Cole 'one of the great left backs of all time' and praised the Chelsea man for his big game performances. Maldini, who won over 100 caps for Italy before retiring from international football in 2002, said Cole would have been one of the first players on the teamsheet if he were in charge. World class: Ashley Cole is still one of the best in the world according to Maldini . 'I don't understand': The former Italy defender says he would have taken Cole to Brazil . Maldini said: ‘Ashley Cole is one of the great left backs of all time - and I have seen nothing to suggest that he is still not one of the best in the world. ‘The coach must make his own decisions - but he would have been one of the first players I would have picked. ‘Not only for his big game experience - but for the way he performs in the big games.

"By . Adrian Durham . Follow @@talkSPORTDrive . JOSE MOURINHO HAS WRECKED ASHLEY COLE'S ENGLAND CAREER . JENKINSON, GAYLE AND WICKHAM DESERVE ENGLAND RECOGNITION . For years and years Manchester City fans knew nothing about trophies. Odd-shaped silver things that never came anywhere near Maine Road. And then Shiekh Mansour arrived with billions of pounds and he was ready to pump endless stacks of cash into the club. Good luck to him and his club I say. If he’s prepared to spend big, put money into football and make City fans happy at the same time – why not? The control freaks at UEFA need to wind their necks in and deal with bigger issues in the game. Just the start: Vincent Kompany lifts the Premier League trophy after Manchester City beat West Ham on Sunday to win the title by two points . Next level: Kompany and City manager Manuel Pellegrini must now conquer Europe in 2014-2015 . Investment return: Sheikh Mansour (second right) expects a constant stream of silverware for the millions he has pumped into the club . Winning trophies wouldn’t be the difficult part – Pellegrini was gifted £100m worth of players last summer, and not all of them regulars in the starting line-up. That’s a lot of garnish alongside the already brilliant players including this season’s true stars Aguero, Silva, Toure, Hart, Dzeko and Kompany. You’ve got to be pretty useless not to win silverware with the current City squad. The difficult part for Sheikh Mansour is raising the expectations of City fans. They are stuck in their old ways: they didn’t want Roberto Mancini to go after he had won a title and an FA Cup – he was still a hero to the supporters. Never mind that he’d completely lost the dressing room. The fans held the Capital One Cup aloft like it was something revered in Abu Dhabi. If Sheikh Mansour was excited about it when they beat Sunderland at Wembley, a little bit of research would reveal last year’s final was between Swansea and Bradford. Just the beginning: Pellegrini's first piece of silverware was the League Cup in March, but this trophy is bottom of City's priority list . Warning signs: Roberto Mancini was sacked after failing to win a trophy last season . Fair to say the League Cup might excite the success-starved City fans trying to make up for all those lost years after Dennis Tuert’s overhead kick, but it’s not why the billions are being pumped in. Winning that trophy was almost embarrassing for a mega-rich club like City. No, the owners made it clear when they arrived they want to be “winning in Europe.” The Champions League is everything to the Sheikh, along with the kudos of being accepted at the same table as Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona. Domestic domination is seen as inevitable for Manchester City by Abu Dhabi. The managers they appoint will be judged by what they achieve in Europe, and to that end, Manuel Pellegrini failed this season. Domination: Manchester City's owners want to emulate the achievements of Bayern Munich at home and abroad . Not bad: Manuel Pellegrini and Yaya Toure size up the Premier League trophy during Man City's open-top bus parade on Monday . I’m not saying he’s about to get the chop – far from it. But he should be aware that 18 months before Mancini was sacked, the owner had declared that his manager was on “the right path” and it would “take time” as City were heading out of the Champions League. There is nothing wrong with City fans, who have been United’s embarrassing inferior little brother for decades, enjoying every piece of success and silverware their club gives them, and waving it all right in front of every United fan’s face. But the owners set a higher standard than a League Cup and another Premier League title. They want European domination for Manchester City. Anything less is failure.","For the millions invested, City should expect to win the Premier League .

"By . Bianca London . For years they have been unfairly regarded as the sole preserve of maiden aunts and respectable ladies of a certain vintage. Now pearls are replacing diamonds as a staple of the fashion set after being championed by the Duchess of Cambridge, among countless other celebrities. Elegant pearl earrings - as worn by the former Kate Middleton on last month’s royal tour of Australia and New Zealand - have become a wardrobe must-have. Girl with pearl earrings: The Duchess of Cambridge has long championed pearls and is setting a trend . It’s not just British royalty who are pearl fans. America’s First Lady Michelle Obama is often seen wearing her favourite double-stranded pearl necklace and fashion icon Sarah Jessica Parker has long been a fan of pearls. She wore an eye-catching strand of pearls at the launch of her pop-up shop in New York in February and regularly accessorises her outfits with pearls. Thanks to the Duchess of Cambridge and . Sarah Jessica Parker, pearl wearers are becoming younger and championed . by the fashion faces such as Rihanna and Cara Delevingne. Big fans: Lady Michelle Obama is often seen wearing her favourite double stranded pearl necklace, left, while Sarah Jessica Parker has long been a fan of pearls .

Makeover: The Duchess of Cambridge teams her pearls with high-fashion outfits for a contemporary look - meaning the gem has suddenly become cool and worn by the likes of Jessie J, left, and Rihanna . So popular have they become that classic sets of the gems are being sold for huge sums by one of the world’s leading auction houses. Bonhams believes natural pearls are now hitting record prices because of their rarity - overfishing and pollution mean the supply of new natural pearls is waning - coupled with the influence of celebrities. Other pearl fans include singer Katy Perry, Angelina Jolie and Scarlett Johansson. The . Duchess of Cambridge factor - teaming pearls with high-fashion outfits . to create a more contemporary look - means pearls suddenly have an . important new cachet. Big earner: While the younger A-listers like Rita Ora, left, and Ashley Olsen opt for more contemporary designs, classic sets of the gems are being sold for huge sums by auction houses . Sought after: Bonhams says investors are increasingly snapping up rare natural pearls because of their increasing rarity, do Mariah Carey, left, and Goldie Hawn have lucrative pearls? The Duchess looked stunning in a set of simple pearl drop earrings visiting Christchurch, New Zealand, last month. But it was not the first time Kate has modelled pearls, and her patronage is introducing them to a new generation. Jean Ghika, head of jewellery in the UK and Europe at Bonhams said: 'Pearls were once seen as a bit dated - perhaps the preserve of an older generation, but we’ve seen a complete change in how they are viewed. 'A . younger fashion set is now completely at home wearing classic pearl . earrings and you’re as likely to see them in nightclubs and premieres as . you are at Ascot or the Epsom Derby.' Bonhams says investors are increasingly snapping up rare natural pearls because of their increasing rarity. Reality TV approved: TOWIE's Lydia Bright, left, and Made In Chelsea's Kimberley Garner, right, are fans . Really good examples of natural pearl - based on size, uniform shape, lustre and blemish-free skins - do not appear on the market as often as they used to. Miss Ghika added: “They are a rare commodity and it is often very difficult to find good quality examples. Quite simply, the supply of natural pearls is not going to increase. 'Long-term, they will become more of a rarity and therefore even more highly prized. As a result, pearls that have some age, or were part of a historic collection, can be highly appealing to potential buyers and investors.' The auction house has recently recorded record sales of natural pearls, including a pair of natural pearl and diamond earrings which sold for £290,500 in April - double their estimate.

They also auctioned a single natural pearl measuring 11.5mm mounted as a ring, which sold in April for £30,000, ten times the upper estimate and a long single strand of graduated natural pearls measuring 5.5mm-8.5mm, . which sold for £87,600 in April 2012, more than double the pre-sale . estimate. A rare pearl worn as one of a pair of earrings for years has just sold at auction for a world record £811,000. It . was worn as jewellery by a lady who had no idea how much it . was worth and two large round pearls made up the earrings that had been . given to her as a gift by her husband. He later showed them to experts who identified one of the gems as a natural pearl. Experts from Woolley and Wallis Auctioneers of Salisbury, Wilts, gave it a pre-sale estimate of £120,000. But . competitive bidding drove the hammer price up to £680,000. With all the . fees added on, the overall price paid was £811,600 and it was bought by . renowned international jewellers David Morris of London's Bond Street. It will now be made into a necklace for a potential buyer in Hong Kong. A pearl is produced within the soft tissue of a living shelled mollusc. Pearls . that occur spontaneously in the wild - or 'natural pearls' - are rare . but extremely valuable and are made up of nearly 100 per cent calcium . carbonate and conchiolin. They come in a variety of shapes but, the rounder they are, the more valuable. Cultured pearls, however, are the result of the a piece of mantle tissue from a shell being transplanted into another shell. The . only way to differentiate between natural and cultured is via X-ray at a . gem-testing laboratory - a cultured pearl will show a different . structure. Imitation pearls are made of mother-of-pearl, coral or conch shell. £2.19m is one of most expensive pearls to be auctioned at Christie's.","Duchess of Cambridge has given pearls a contemporary edge .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . He's called Pippa Middleton ugly, Adele fat and Lana del Rey fake, and now Karl Lagerfeld has unleashed his acid tongue on pretty much anyone who has had cosmetic surgery in attempt to conceal the aging process. 'The worst are the lip operations,' he rants to Zeit Online. 'They look like they flew through the windscreen during a car accident and were patched up badly afterwards.' The 88-year-old fashion designer - who is perhaps as famous for his cutting remarks as he is for his work at the helm of Chanel - added that he knows people he doesn't even 'recognize' after they've undergone lip surgery. Outspoken: Eighty-eight-year-old Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld (pictured last week in London) has slammed those who go under the knife in order to look younger . 'Nothing makes you look older than attempting to look young,' he continues. And Mr Lagerfeld's contempt for the 'old' appears to extend much further than just those who try to cheat the clock by going under the knife. 'I don't know anyone from my generation. I find those people terrible', he admits, favoring the company of much younger people instead. Car crash? Mr Lagerfeld took particular issue with lip surgery, likening people who have had it (such as Jocelyn Wildenstein, 74, pictured) with victims of car accidents who have 'flown through the windscreen' Fans: Other notable sporters of the trout pout include Courtney Stodden (right) and actress Lindsay Lohan (left) who was once regularly seen on the arm of Mr Lagerfeld, but before she allegedly started having lip injections . And he is true to his word when it comes to hanging out with a younger crowd. The formidable fashion king regularly makes appearances in the selfies of the young Hollywood-elite, most recently posing at a Prada store launch party with 21-year-old model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne and singer Lily Allen, 29. He's also a fan of 24-year-old actress Kristen Stewart, who stars in his latest campaign for Chanel, and was once regularly spotted in the company of Lindsay Lohan - although that was before she started sporting her famous 'trout pout', and we know now how he feels about that. But even his favorite supermodel, Miss Delevingne, hasn't escaped Mr Lagerfeld's sharp tongue of late. Speaking to The Guardian last month, he revealed that he did not consider the bushy-browed Brit to be 'a standout beauty' - but rather a model with 'strange' proportions. Younger crowd: The formidable designer also says he prefers the company of younger friends (pictured with Cara Delevingne and Lily Allen last week) over his own 'terrible' generation . Sharp tongued: Despite Miss Delevingne being a firm favorite of Mr Lagerfeld (pictured together closing Chanel's AW14 show) he recently said he doesn't consider the model to be 'a standout beauty' He also spoke frankly of his views on tattoos, beloved by his many youthful friends worldwide, saying: 'Tattoos are like sleeping in a printed T-shirt, you will never get clean again.' Mr Lagerfeld, who has enjoyed a 67 year career in the fashion industry, concludes his interview with Zeit by offering a little insight as to the very beginnings of his age-related preferences. 'As a child I only had one wish: to be grown up,' he remarks. 'I didn't play with other children, I thought they were dreadful. The only thing I did was read, learn languages and sketch.'","The Chanel designer has a particular disdain for lip surgery .

"By . Bianca London . While the honeymoon period may only last for the first few months of a relationship, love and romance can have long lasting positive effects, a new study reveals. Psychologists of the German Universities of Jena and Kassel have found that being in a relationship can have a positive effect on personality development in young adults - and even reduce neuroticism. Speaking about the study, published in the online edition of Journal of Personality, psychologists said: 'We were able to show that they become more stable in a love relationship, and that their personality stabilises.' The never-ending Honeymoon period? A new study has found that being in a long-term relationship can stabilize your personality and have lomg-term positive effects . Researchers analysed 245 couples between the ages of 18 and 30 and looked at the correlation  between neuroticism and relationship satisfaction. Scientists also asked participants to imagine made-up scenarios and how they'd react. 'This part was crucial, because neurotic people process influences from the outside world differently,' explained one researcher. Positive effects: Researchers found that the longer someone was in a relationship, the less negatively they looked on situations, therefore making them less neurotic . 'For instance, they react more strongly to negative stimuli and have a tendency to interpret ambiguous situations negatively instead of positively or neutrally.' Researchers found that the longer someone was in a relationship, the less negatively they looked on situations. 'The positive experiences and emotions gained by having a partner change the personality - not directly but indirectly - as at the same time the thought structures and the perception of presumably negative situations change,' added researchers.","Study by psychologists of the German Universities of Jena and Kassel .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Skin saver? Kale now making its way into skincare with organic brand Éminence set to release a citrus and kale serum next month . Just one cup of chopped kale contains 206per cent of your recommended daily intake of vitamin A, 134per cent of vitamin C, and a whopping 684per cent of vitamin K - but would you put it on your face? The superfood is now making its way into skincare with organic brand Éminence set to release a citrus and kale serum next month. With added ingredients like spinach, broccoli, avocado, lemon, and grapefruit, the $110 serum claims to brighten and lighten sun-damaged skin, prevent inflammation, and reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Spinach is . loaded with beta-carotene and lutein, two nutrients that have been . shown to improve skin elasticity, according to a study in the Journal of . Agricultural Food Chemistry. Meanwhile . avocado - applied topically - has long been touted to moisturize the . skin, treat sunburn and reduce wrinkles, and grapefruit, ;oaded with . vitamin C, helps fade spots by reducing excess production of skin . pigment. And . kale's vitamin K, which in the body plays a major role in helping blood . to clot properly, is often used topically to treat rosacea, remove . spider veins and stretch marks, and speed up skin healing after surgery - reducing bruising, swelling and scars. Dr . Pauline Hili, who is behind the skin care brand Nourish and who recently launched a kale anti-aging eye cream, told The Telegraph that 'kale is a . super-food . with one of the highest levels of beneficial vitamins, particularly . vitamin K. From salad to skin: With added ingredients like spinach, broccoli, avocado, lemon, and grapefruit, the serum claims to brighten and lighten sun-damaged skin, prevent inflammation, and reduce fine lines and wrinkles . 'We know that topical addition of vitamins can be up to 100 . times more effective for the skin,' she explained. 'It just makes sense to use this . ingredient as a powerhouse to re-invigorate the skin. Its delicate . effectiveness makes it particularly suitable for around the eye.' Nourish's Revital-Eyes Kale Biomimetic Anti-Ageing Eye Cream promises to protect skin elasticity, reduce the appearance of wrinkles and redness whilst promoting healing and a reduction in puffiness. But while the benefits of eating kale, which is also loaded with antioxidants that can quench free radicals, have been proven time and time again, the dark green leaf still needs further study when it comes to its effectiveness in skin care according to dermatologist Dr. Whitney Bowe. 'Kale has the potential to be a great . anti-aging ingredient and could potentially even help boost the . protective effects of sunscreen,' Dr. Bowe told MailOnline. 'But it still needs further study to ensure that those effective ingredients can penetrate the surface layers of the skin, and are stabilized in such a way as to still be effective by the time they reach the skin.'","Kale is high in vitamin k, which is used to treat rosacea, remove spider veins and stretch marks, and reduce bruising, swelling and scars ."
"By . Ruth Styles . Perched on the edge of glamorous Copacabana Beach, Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana Palace is one of the most exclusive hotels in the world. Beloved of the rich, famous and powerful, it has played host to everyone from Prince Charles to Marilyn Monroe during its 90 years in existence. Now the hotel has opened its doors to a team of documentary makers  - and the results are eye-opening. Luxury: The Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro has played host to a who's who of Hollywood and real royalty . From the guest who has 'moved in' to the hotel, along with his pet bichon frise and mountain of Louis Vuitton luggage, to the president demanding a room made up with entirely new bed linen, it seems there's no limit when it comes to pleasing the people who stay there. One regular is Marco Antonio di Biaggi, a Brazilian celebrity hairdresser who made his millions via his salon business and decamps to the Copacabana Palace each weekend. 'I was born very, very poor and I . remember when I was a teenager, I saw Copacabana Palace from the front, . and thought: ""One day, I'll stay here"",' he remembers. 'And I work very, very hard for it. I'm a famous hairdresser and I work 12 to 14 hours a day. There is no . secret - that's how I can afford to come to Copacabana Palace every . weekend.' The coiffeur, who lives in Sao Paulo, says the secret of the hotel's success is knowing what guests want - and delivering it before they even think to ask. Glamorous guests: Madonna spent 10 days at the Copacabana Palace and Princess Diana also visited . Regular visitor: Celebrity hairdresser Marco Antonio di Biaggi spends every weekend at the Rio hotel . Sumptuous: Baccarat crystal chandeliers decorate the public areas at the Copacabana Palace . 'Copacabana Palace is very unique,' he explains. 'I know . everybody and they know what I like. For example, in Brazil, we don't do . the eggs, we don't like the omelettes. 'We like the fresh fruit and the . pastries, and they always make the special ones I like for me.' And Mr di Biaggi is by no means alone in his appreciation of the Copacabana Palace's charms. Joining him on the guest list is a veritable who's who of real and Hollywood royalty - all of whom come with special requests. In charge of dealing with them is Anne Phillips, a glamorously coiffed and perfectly presented woman who has been working in hospitality for 60 years. 'Every hotel has a golden book, wherever they are in the world,' she explains. 'These are guest books of very VIP guests who have . stayed with us.' While most behave, not all are so considerate, among them actor Orson Welles. 'There's a story that he threw a desk out . the window during a ball because he thought his one love had been . unfaithful or something like that,' she remembers. Fine dining: Guests have the choice four different restaurants to choose from and can eat in their rooms . Comfortable: According to manager Andrea Natal, the hotel is home to the most comfortable mattresses in Rio . 'I don't know how he could throw a . desk out of the window - I really don't know how he did it.' Much better behaved were Fred Astaire and Ginger Rodgers, who immortalised the hotel in their 1933 film, Flying Down to Rio. More recent guests have included Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber and even the King of Sweden, although as Phillips points out, King Carl XVI Gustaf isn't the first European royal to visit. 'Charles . and Diana were here,' she says. 'They stayed in the Presidential Suite. I've had Madonna here too -  I . had Madonna for 10 days. 'Francis . Ford Coppola, he was very nice. And Robert de Niro, I had him . down here. And he was here when Francis Coppola was here and it was . difficult because we didn't know he was coming, so we had to manouvre a . lot and keep him happy until we could get him up to the sixth floor.' Although no room at the Copacabana Palace comes cheap, the sixth floor is where the most luxurious suites are to be found. So expensive are the rooms, the hotel won't publish the prices which means, glamorous though it might sound, keeping Hollywood's finest happy is an exhausting job. 'You do wind up working through the night . sometimes,' explains Phillips. 'Especially if, like Tom Cruise, they're keeping to California . times. Early riser: Tom Cruise insisted on being served breakfast at 4am . Immortal: Fred Astaire starred in 1933's Flying Down to Rio . Visit: Recent guests have included Justin Bieber . Fit for an A-lister! Each room boasts an elaborate granite and marble en-suite bathroom . Idyllic: The exclusive hotel boasts incredible views of Rio de Janeiro's glamorous Copacabana Beach . 'You do wind up giving them breakfast at 4am in the morning or . something like that.' With the majority of A-listers now eschewing hotels for the privacy of rented villas, what keeps them coming back to the Copacabana Palace? Manager Andrea Natal thinks she has some answers. 'Once you are inside this hotel, you feel . peaceful,' she reveals. 'We have an open-air pool, with a beautiful bar. And I think, . in this hotel, we have the most comfortable mattresses that I ever saw in . my life. 'That is something remarkable,' she continues. 'Keith Richards' wife bought . two mattresses from us. 'We have people who love to serve, to pamper people. We have to make sure guests are happy because, ultimately, that is what they're here for.'

"By . Lizzie Parry . Cancer-fighting cells harvested from a mother-of-six have been used to fight the tumours invading her body - a treatment hailed by doctors as a 'blueprint for treating the disease'. Melinda Bachini, from Billings, Montana, was diagnosed with a rare bile duct cancer on her son's 14th birthday in December 2009. Doctors warned the 45-year-old she had just months to live. But experts at the National Cancer Institute in the U.S. have developed a new treatment, hailed as a 'blueprint for fighting cancer', successfully shrinking Mrs Bachini's tumours by a quarter. Melinda Bachini, from Montana in the U.S. was diagnosed with a rare form of bile duct cancer in December 2009 . The mother-of-six was given just months to live. When a course of powerful chemotherapy failed to shrink her tumours, Mrs Bachini researched her options on the internet, stumbling across a trial that was taking place at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland . The case, reported in the journal Science, involved experts harvesting Mrs Baldhini's own immune cells - those which were identified as having the right tools to attack the tumours. The cells were then replicated in the laboratory, and implanted back into Mrs Bachini's body. They have now been attacking and shrinking her tumour for the last six months. 'It's the first time we have been able to actually target a specific mutation in the immune system,' Dr Steven Rosenburg told NBC. 'It represents a blueprint for how to do this. It is a new method for potentially attacking any kind of cancer.' While her hair is now growing back and she is once again chasing around after her three youngest children, Mrs Bachini is realistic - she still has cancer. When her disease came to light, cancer was not on Mrs Bachini's radar, she said. Doctors were carrying out tests to detect gallstones and found a mass in her liver. After . breaking the news, medics started the 45-year-old on a course of . chemotherapy, which damaged the nerves in her ears, hands and feet. But . the treatment failed to shrink her tumours. Researching the options . available to her, Mrs Bachini found details of a trial taking place at . the National Institutes of Health. The 45-year-old, pictured with her husband and six children, became the first patient to have her own immune cells harvested from her body, grown in a lab and implanted back into her body to fight the disease . Mrs Bachini's tumours have now shrunk by around 25 per cent, since undergoing the pioneering new treatment, hailed by the team behind it as a 'blueprint for treating cancer' She signed up and started treatment in March 2012. The study centres on immune cells known as CD4 T-cells, which can detect cancer cells and in some cases destroy the disease. The process of cancer immunotherapy, has for years, tried to pinpoint those T-cells and replicate them for patients. Dr Rosenburg said it has been difficult to perform the process in epithelial cancers - solid tumours which account for around 80 per cent of all cancers. But he said recent advances in genetic sequencing have meant it is now more likely to be successful. His team removed a tumour from Mrs Bachini's left lung, and managed to extract the T-cells found attacking the disease. Over the course of a month, the experts nurtured the cells, growing them in a lab. A powerful bout of chemotherapy was then prescribed to kill off any other immune cells, working within Mrs Bachini's body. Once the chemotherapy was complete, the T-cells were implanted. Bile duct cancer affects around 2,500 people in the U.S. and another 1,000 people in the UK each year . There are only around 2,500 new cases of cholangiocarinoma diagnosed each year in the U.S and a further 1,000 in the UK. The five-year relative survival rate for early stage cases of the disease is only about 30 per cent. Bile ducts are tubes that carry bile. The main function of bile is to break down fats in food to help our digestion. Bile is made by the liver and stored in the gall bladder. The bile ducts connect the liver to the gall bladder. The cause of most bile duct cancers is unknown. A number of conditions, including the chronic inflammatory bowel condition ulcerative colitis can increase a person's risk of developing cancer. Those born with congenital abnormalities of the bile ducts, such as choledochal cysts, also have a higher risk of developing the rare cancer. In Africa and Asia bile duct cancers are thought to be caused by an infection caused by a parasite known as the liver fluke. The disease can strike at any age, but more than two in three cases occur in those aged over 65 years old. Cancer in the bile ducts causes the tubes to block, prohibiting the flow of bile from the liver to the intestines. It causes the bile to seep back into the blood causing a person to become jaundice - their skin and whites of their eyes become yellow. Other symptoms include abdominal discomfort, a loss of appetite, high temperatures and weight loss. Source: Macmillan Cancer Support . For six months the tumours shrank, and for the next six months they stablised. But as the cancer mutated, the disease started to grow again. By this time Dr Rosenburg and his team had managed to develop a technique to map the tumour and find the mutations. After stringing together all the mutated DNA, the scientists tested it against a sample of their patient's T-cells - a feat that would not have been possible were it not for the new high-throughput genome sequencing technique. The team found the precise T-cells that could attack the tumours and once again cultivated them in the lab before implanting them back into Mrs Bachini's body. For the last six months her tumours have once again been shrinking in size. She added: 'When I went into this trial I felt like I had nothing to lose but everything to gain.' 'Life definitely doesn’t stop because you have cancer,' she said.","Melinda Bachini was diagnosed with bile duct cancer in December 2009 .

"By . Emma Innes . A mother has today told of her horror after her baby was born with ‘two heads’. Ellie Wellman-Smith, 20, said when Harry, now one, was born he had such a large growth on his shoulder, prompting fears her son had a second head. But after surgery to remove the fluid-filled growth, Harry is now a healthy toddler. Ms Wellman-Smith said she is glad she chose not to have routine pregnancy scans, which could have led doctors to offer her a termination. Harry Barron-Edgley, now one, was born with a huge fluid-filled lump on his shoulder . When Harry Barron-Edgley was born he had a lymphatic malformation – a fluid-filled lump just under the skin. Ms Wellman-Smith said: ‘Lymphatic malformations can sometimes indicate lots of other problems including chromosomal abnormalities. I probably would have been told that termination was an option. ‘As it is, Harry is a lively, wonderful, healthy child. He can eat, he can play, he can mess around with his brother and enjoy life.’ Single parent Ms Wellman-Smith, a former financial services advisor, was initially shocked when Harry was born with the large growth after a 15-hour labour. She said: ‘I said aloud what I thought - it looked just like a second head. When he was two months old, Harry had surgery to remove the growth and he is now a healthy one-year-old . Harry's mother, Ellie Wellman-Smith, 20, says that when Harry was born she initially thought he had two heads . Ms Wellman-Smith says she chose not to have any pregnancy scans and that she is now pleased she made this decision as she fears she would have been advised to terminate the pregnancy . ‘I was worried it was some kind of cancer. If you see a cyst or a lump on anyone’s body, that’s what naturally comes to mind. ‘After I’d gone through the surprise, I had an instinct that Harry would be alright. I didn’t panic - I knew he would be fine.’ She was able to take Harry home for three weeks as doctors decided on the best course of action. A lymphatic malformation is an area in the body containing clear fluid. It appears as a lump just under the skin, often in the neck or armpit. It occurs when the lymph vessel fails to form correctly during the early weeks of pregnancy. Most do not need treatment other than careful cleaning to prevent infection. However, they might need treatment if they interfere with breathing or feeding or if they are large and restrict movement. There are a number of different treatment options including surgery. Source: Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital . A specialist surgeon at Birmingham Children’s Hospital eventually removed the huge cyst in a series of operations when Harry was eight weeks old. Ms Wellman-Smith, from Corby, in Northamptonshire, said: ‘It was impossible to get t-shirts over him, and his head would always slump forward when he was sitting upright because the cyst was too heavy. ‘At first we were told that Harry could have injections which would stabilise the growth, and it would become less noticeable as he grew up. ‘I was devastated. I worried about bullying at school and how he would cope with his first nights out in town as a teenager - all the day-to-day challenges he would face. ‘The surgery was risky. There was a 30 per cent chance of damage to a nerve which controls Harry’s shoulder. But I was determined to do the right thing by him.’ Harry’s wound became infected following the procedure and he required four more operations during a month-long hospital stay. Ms Wellman-Smith, who also has a two-year-old son, Bailey, was finally able to take Harry home when he was three months old. She said: ‘It’s been quite a journey. When you’re caring for a baby with health problems your whole life changes. The things you worried about in your old life seem completely ridiculous. Ms Wellman-Smith said: 'Harry is a lively, wonderful, healthy child. He can eat, he can play, he can mess around with his brother and enjoy life' Since having the lump removed, Harry has restricted movement in his shoulder and this is being investigated . Ms Wellman-Smith said that she was worried Harry might have cancer when she saw the lump and that she was relieved to find out this was not the case. Harry is pictured after his operation . ‘I chose not to have a 12 week scan when I was pregnant because it didn’t matter to me whether Harry had any disabilities or not, and I’m really glad I didn’t change my mind. ‘I can imagine other families of children with lymphatic malformations going through with the scan and being given a list of all the serious health problems that it might indicate, and thinking that the risk to the child’s quality of life was too great. ‘It’s easy to see how the temptation would be to terminate, and try again for a healthy baby.’ Ms Wellman-Smith said: 'Harry's hilarious. He's the naughtiest one-year-old you'll ever meet. He copies his older brother in all his cheeky behaviour.' Image shows the cyst being prepared for surgery . After the cyst was removed (pictured) Harry developed an infection and had to have four more operations . Harry now follows a special diet to regulate lymphatic fluid in his body and experiences some mobility problems in his right shoulder which are currently being investigated. Ms Wellman-Smith marked her son’s first birthday on May 2 with a party at which she asked friends and supporters to make a donation to the Birmingham Children’s Hospital. She said: ‘Harry’s hilarious. He’s the naughtiest one-year-old you’ll ever meet. He copies his older brother in all his cheeky behaviour. ‘I’m so glad he’s with us.’","Harry Barron-Edgley, now one, was born with a huge fluid-filled lump .

"By . Emma Innes . Robert Collett, 62, died from heart failure following a routine knee operation . A 62-year-old grandfather died from heart failure while undergoing a routine knee operation after NHS doctors failed to act when he showed signs of cardiac distress, it emerged today. Robert Collett was assessed at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham and found to have an abnormal heart reading just a week before the procedure. But doctors went ahead with a total knee replacement even though he complained of chest pains in the anaesthetic room. And medics even refused to halt the operation when the father-of-three started showing signs of cardiac distress in the theatre. The grandfather-of-two suffered a cardiac arrest and died after being transferred to Birmingham City Hospital just hours after the operation on February 9, 2011. Today his family received an admission of responsibility from The Royal Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. Expert evidence found a catalogue of failings at the hospital and concluded Mr Collett would still be alive today if staff had halted the knee surgery. But his wife Angela, 54, a former nurse, said she was furious she had received no apology for her ‘needless’ loss. Mrs Collett, who worked at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital at the time of her husband’s death, but has since left, added: ‘I went to the theatre recovery room on my lunch break and it was unusually quiet. ‘I remember asking two nurses where my husband was and when I said his name was Robert Collett, their faces just dropped. ‘I was told he would be transferred to City Hospital where they could treat him. ‘Because of my job I knew the policy was that doctors can only transfer patients once they are stable so I hoped that was the case. ‘But when I arrived I was taken straight into the relative’s room and was told Robert had suffered a cardiac arrest and there was nothing anybody could do, he had died. Mr Collett complained of chest pains while in the anaesthetic room at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham but the operation went ahead without further investigation . ‘Robert’s death has left a huge hole in all of our lives. ‘Had they taken notice of his complaints of chest pain and carried out the necessary investigations he may still be here today. ‘Whilst I am relieved the Trust has admitted liability, it won’t bring him back.’ Mr Collett, from Halesowen, West Midlands, left behind his devastated wife Angela, his three children and two grandchildren. The part-time driver was referred to the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in 2010 by his GP after suffering from knee pain. Doctors said he would need a complete replacement and a decision was made that he would stay awake during the surgery. But medics went ahead with the operation despite clinicians hearing him complain of chest pains and feeling unwell beforehand. The trust confirmed in writing that ‘had the procedure therefore been discontinued when the deceased first developed chest pain it is likely that the arrhythmia would have been avoided and the cardiac arrest would not have occurred’. The family are now in line for a compensation payout following the admission of liability. An inquest into Mr Collett’s death at Birmingham Coroner’s Court last year heard he was coughing as the operation began and his oxygen levels had dropped. As he struggled to breathe, cracking noises were heard through the stethoscope which was fluid leaking into his lungs, but the surgery continued. A coroner criticised the anaesthetic records at the hospital and recommended bosses use the case as an example in lessons to all of their staff on the importance of competent record keeping. And an independent review carried out by The Royal College of Anaesthetists after Mr Collett’s death found a catalogue of mistakes had been made including ‘extremely poor’ record keeping. The probe also said the leadership by the senior anaesthetist was ‘poor’ and revealed the standard of pre-operative assessment was also ‘poor’. Laura Ralfe, a medical law expert at Irwin Mitchell, who represented the family, said: ‘There are clear guidelines in place on the importance of assessing a patient’s pre and ongoing-surgery condition so there is no excuse for all of these points being noted as poor in the independent review that was carried out following Robert’s death. ‘The . evidence we obtained from medical experts was clear - a complaint of . chest pain should have led to the surgery being stopped. ‘Instead, . a catalogue of failings meant Mr Collett died a completely preventable . death which has obviously been incredibly hard for his family to come to . terms with. ‘Whilst . we welcome the admission of liability from the Trust we remain . concerned at the lack of reassurance that lessons have been learnt and . improvements made to protect patient safety in future. ‘The . Collett’s and future patients deserve confirmation that every possible . step has been taken to prevent the same mistakes from happening again.’ During the operation the surgeons also failed to stop operating when Mr Collett started to show signs of cardiac distress. The hospital has now admitted responsibility for his death . Jo Chambers, Chief Executive of the hospital trust, said: 'The Royal Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust apologises sincerely to the family of Mr Robert Collett for their loss and the on going distress this has caused. 'The trust has admitted liability in this case for failure to discontinue the patient's operation when there were clear indications that this should have been considered. 'Since 2011 the trust has put in place a number of measures to make sure the same mistakes don’t happen again. 'In acknowledging the findings of an independent review carried out by the Royal College of Anaesthetists after Mr Collett’s death, the trust has developed a new method of pre-operative assessment where a consultant anaesthetist is available to consider pre-existing conditions likely to affect surgery and to call for additional tests as necessary. 'We have extended and improved our training within the operating team and carried out a peer review of best practice, to improve communication. 'We’re carrying out an ongoing review of record keeping, and in several unannounced visits by the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and Care Quality Commission (CQC) improvements to our record keeping have been acknowledged on each occasion.'","Robert Collett was at Royal Orthopaedic Hospital, Birmingham for surgery .

"By . Binky Felstead . Mums, mates and make-up: when a girl's feeling low, this triple-whammy of female gorgeousness is guaranteed to lift the spirits. For those who have been watching MIC recently, you'll know I've been through a rough patch, romantically - suffice to say, I'm grateful for the invention of waterproof mascara, as I've shed an ocean of tears in the last few weeks. Mummy Felstead to the rescue! 'We're going to get you through this,' she announced. Before I knew what was happening, she'd got on the phone to my friend, the singer Stacey Jackson, who just happened to be shooting the video for her new single Dance The Night Away. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Binky appears in Stacey Jackson's latest music video, Dance The Night Away . Together my mum and my mate arranged for me to be chauffeured to the video set and glamorously made up, so I could appear in the video. The song is a funky house number and the vid is set in a nightclub - so it called for a sultry nighttime face. I was so pleased with my look, created by brilliant make-up artist Buster Knight, that I thought I'd share it with you. STEP 1: The Face . Forget 'no make-up make-up', this is a full-on high-glamour look, which demands a flawless complexion. Buster began by prepping my skin using Clarins Instant Smooth Perfecting Touch Primer. Next he applied DiorSkin Forever Foundation all over my face, before dotting a touch of Clarins Instant Light Brush-On Perfector on top, to highlight the skin, add definition and camouflage any imperfections. Binky says that by no means is this a natural look and looks best with heavy contouring and dramatic eyes . He fixed this base in place with a dusting of Vichy Dermablend Powder, lightly applied with a big, soft brush. Finally, he contoured and highlighted my face using Daniel Sandler Sculpt and Slim Contour Kit. Last but not least, a swoosh of Guerlain Terracotta Bronzer across my cheeks and forehead gave my skin the warm, sexy glow that I love. STEP 2: The Eyes . Just as with the complexion, prepping the eye area is all-important when creating a dramatic, smoky effect like this one. Buster began by blending bareMinerals Prime Time Brightening Eye Primer across my lids. This creates a smooth base on which to apply colour, and gives your make-up added staying power, ensuring you look just as fabulous leaving the club as you did on arrival. Next, Buster buffed Daniel Sandler Sheer Satin Shadow in Gilded Taupe all over the lid and through the socket, forming a nude base. Then he ran DiorShow Fusion Mono Shadow in Nocturne along the lashes, winging it out at the corners. Using Clarins Crayon Kohl Eye Pencil in black, he intensified my lash line, before applying false eyelashes to create an ultra-glam wink, and finishing up with Too Faced Lash Injection Mascara. Finally, Buster touched up my brows using Too Faced Brow-Nie Brow Pencil, to create a strong frame for my dramatic eyes. Binky achieved her intense eyes with a darker shadow and false lashes . Binky's glamorous lips were created using a nude palette and finished with a high shine gloss and bronzer across her cheeks and forehead gave her a warm, sexy glow . STEP 3: The Lips . This look is all about the intense eyes, so Buster kept my lips luscious but neutral, framing and filling in my lips with Guerlain Lip Liner in Rose de Bulgarie. Next he applied Dior Rouge Couture Colour Lipstick in Ambre Zemire, followed by a sexy slick of Clarins Gloss Prodige in Papaya for the final glamorous touch. If you'd like to recreate this look, you can purchase all the products you need at online beauty boutique, Escentual.com. When Buster had finishing working on my face, I felt newly gorgeous and ready to party. Stacey and I went straight from dancing in the video shoot to dancing all night in a club, with our sultry faces still in place. It was the perfect girly pick-me-up! As all you girls know, you can't beat a bit of retail therapy when you're feeling glum, so I treated myself to some gorgeous new bits from my fave lingerie brand Bluebella. I picked up the Skylar bra and briefs; the pale hue is perfect for spring and I love the girly ruffle detailing. It's a playful, whimsical set with a touch of naughtiness in the form of the sheer fabric - j'adore! The tears are drying and Binky's back!

The company, founded by charismatic CEO Jack Ma in his apartment in 1999, controls 80 per cent of all online commerce in the world's second-largest economy. And it's gearing up to conquer the American market next. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. handled more than 1.5 trillion yuan - about £147 billion ($248 billion) - of transactions for 231 million active users across its three main Chinese online marketplaces in 2013, more than Amazon and eBay Inc combined. It did so with 20,884 full-time workers, fewer than eBay. But if beauty products are more your thing, then Alibaba has some intriguing offers. The female electric nose lifter, for instance, promises to give you a firmer, higher nose by zapping it with vibrations for just three minutes a day. Not to be left out, there is also a wide array of male grooming product for sale. Lovers of Apple products, who also happen to have an embarrassing ear wax problem, can get their hands on a Steve Jobs-banded ear cleaner tool set. The pack contains eight items for ear cleaning and manicuring and is priced at 50p ($0.8) at a minimum order of 2,000 sets. Another popular category on the site is ‘live animals’. In the event you need the services of a camel, then you can purchase 500 for around £350 ($600) each. Unicorn meat (right) and Buddha-shaped pears can also be purchased in bulk on the Chinese retail website . If cutting up bananas is too strenuous, then this gadget could help you reduce both time and effort . And if you want to impress your dinner guests, Alibaba can help in that area too. The site has Buddha-shaped pears on sale, invented by a farmer in China. The £3 ($5) fruit is the invention of Hao Xianzhang who spent six years perfecting the intricate baby pears, carefully crafting each one which grows inside an individual mould. Alibaba was virtually unknown outside Asia just a few years ago, but the Chinese online retailer has now set its sights on global domination. While these products may seem ridiculous, the company has a far more serious goal in sight. The group is preparing an initial public offering that could be the largest opening stock sale in U.S. history - raising up to £11.8 billion ($20 billion), according to some estimates. The company, founded by charismatic chief executive Jack Ma in his apartment in 1999, controls 80 per cent of all online commerce in the world's second-largest economy. You can also purchase 1 million barrels of Libyan crude oil (left) If you don't need that, the how about a ear-wax cleaning kit with Steve Jobs' face on it? (right) You might think excitement over getting an email died with AOL's 'you've got mail' popularity. But if you're one of those people who gets excited every time they get an email, then an LED light which lights up every time your inbox gets a hit, could help you share that excitement .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Austfonna, one of the largest ice caps in the world, is moving much faster than expected. This is according to the recent satellite images which reveal what scientists describe as ‘extraordinary’ changes in the region. The ice cap, which had been relatively stable for years, is located on Norway's Svalbard region and covers just over 3,000 square miles (8,000 sq km). Austfonna, one of the largest ice caps in the world, is moving much faster than expected. Pictured on the bottom right is a satellite image from Sentinel which reveals the region on the move in red . Launch: 3 April 2014 at Kourou, French Guiana . Life: Minimum of seven years . Mass: 2300 kg (5070 lbs) Instrument: C-band synthetic aperture radar . Dimensions: 9.2ft (2.8m) long, 8.2ft (2.5m) wide, 13ft (4m) high . Mission: Monitoring sea ice, oil spills, winds and waves, land-use change and to respond to emergencies such as floods and earthquake . A combination of measurements by Esa’s Sentinel-1A last and Germany’s Terrasar-X satellite recently revealed a dramatic acceleration in ice motion. The movement is in the south eastern section, which is now flowing at least 10 times faster than previously measured, claim scientists. Researchers had believed the Arctic's Austfonna Ice Cap was losing substantial amounts of ice through its major glacier at Cap Mohn. These images confirm that theory. ‘We've observed Austfonna with various satellite radar datasets over the past 20 years, and it hasn't done very much,’ Professor Andy Shepherd from Leeds University told the BBC. The movement is in the south eastern section (pictured) which is now flowing at least 10 times faster than previously measured, claim scientists . Austfonna, which has been relatively stable for years, is located on Norway's Svalbard region and covers just over 3,000 square miles (8,000 square km) ‘But we've now looked at it again with the new Sentienl-1a spacecraft, and it's clear it has speeded up quite considerably in the last two or three years.’ Together, the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets contain more than 99 per cent of the freshwater ice on Earth. Ice sheets are constantly moving, slowly flowing downhill under their own weight. But long as an ice sheet accumulates the same mass of snow as it loses to the sea, it remains stable. Sentinel-1A's ability to 'see' through cloud and rain and in pitch darkness make it particularly useful for monitoring sea ice . Sentinel-1A’s ability to ‘see’ through cloud and rain and in pitch darkness make it particularly useful for monitoring sea ice. Images from its advanced radar can be used to distinguish clearly between the thinner more navigable first-year ice and the hazardous, much thicker multi-year ice. A detailed report on Austfonna and the possible causes of the speed-up is now being prepared for publication in a science journal. 'It remains to be seen whether the abrupt speed-up reflects natural variability in the ice cap motion, or whether it is a symptom of regional climate change,' said Esa.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Patents typically feature groundbreaking devices or innovative uses of existing technology, but Amazon’s latest filing is neither. The retailer has been awarded a patent for taking photos on a white background - a process that has been carried out since cameras were invented. Its filing even details the best way to set up a photography studio, where to place the ‘elevated platform’ - or table - and a step-by-step process. Amazon has been awarded a patent that details a system of taking photos against a white background, stock image pictured. The files even explain how best to set up a photography studio. Amazon has been criticised for patenting a generic shot used regularly by photographers . Amazon is developing a system to send items to buyers before they have even decided they want it. The technique could mean deliveries arrive within minutes - or could even be waiting for buyers when they decide to buy. A patent filed by Amazon in January revealed the plans for its 'anticipatory package shipping'. According to this patent, the packages could wait at the shippers’ hubs, on trucks or even in an apartment building until an order arrives. Packages would be shipped without an exact address, which could be added once an order is made. This would allow Amazon to ship copies of items such a popular book on the day it is published, for instance. The reasoning behind Amazon's application remains a mystery. One source, however, suggested Amazon might be wanting to patent how products are photographed and rotated on the site's vast catalogue. Although it sounds like a joke, the patent is available on the U.S Patent and Trademark Office website and was awarded in March. Of course, the filing is more specific and although it describes a standard ‘studio arrangement with a background comprising a white cyclorama and a front light source’, it does go into more detail. For example, it states the ‘image capture position’ needs to be located between ‘the background and the front light source in the longitudinal axis’, and the shot should be taken with an 85mm lens. It goes on to say there should be ‘at least one image capture device further configured with an ISO setting of 320 and an f-stop value of 5.6.’ Images of the arrangement show the ‘elevated platform’, depicted as a table, positioned between the ‘image capture position and the background in the longitudinal axis’. The filing describes a standard studio arrangement with a white background and front light source. It also states the 'image capture position' needs to be located between 'the background and the front light source in the longitudinal axis', pictured left. The patent even describes the work flow process, pictured right . Amazon additionally claims the shot should be taken with an 85mm lens and goes on to say there should be 'at least one image capture device further configured with an ISO setting of about 320 and an f-stop value of about 5.6'. This patent image shows the layout described in the files . It goes on to describe a 'front light source being directed toward a subject on the elevated platform’ with ‘a first rear light source aimed at the background and positioned between the elevated platform and the background.' In short, Amazon has described a camera pointing at a person sat on a table being lit from the front and rear, with additional lights above and below. Amazon claimed this arrangement will result in photos that don’t require a lot of editing in post-production. But as Gizmodo’s Ashley Feinberg explained: 'Amazon almost undoubtedly did not pioneer this technique’ but ‘the extensive and specific conditions listed mean there is pretty much no way to either violate it or know if the patent has even been violated in the first place.","The U.S Trademark and Patent Office awarded the patent in March .

"By . Mia De Graaf . It is 3,341 years since Tutankhamun was laid to rest in one of the most opulent tombs ever crafted by human hands. The gilded wood walls dotted with blue porcelain, giant casket, and 16-foot shrine lay undetected until British archaeologist Howard Carter found it in 1922. Since then, billions have flocked to visit the 19-year-old ruler's resting place in Egypt's Valley Of The Kings - and the delicate chamber is starting to crumble. Recreation: Designers, scientists and historians have worked for years using these 3D scanners to create exact replicas of the 19-year-old ruler's resting place . In a desperate bid to protect the famous tomb, an exact replica has been built almost next door in the southern city of Luxor. A multinational team of scientists and historians have worked for years mocking up every detail with high-tech 3D scanners. It is hoped visitors will go to see the . replica instead of causing further damage to the original, which could . well be closed to the public eventually. Without falsely ageing the chamber, the team insists it will feel authentic. 'I want people to come in and actually say, ""My goodness, I can't tell the difference!"",' Adam Lowe, the British head of Madrid-based company Factum Lowe which is leading the project, told the Financial Times. The original: This is Tutankhamun's mummified body in its original casket surrounded by painted and gilded wood walls that have survived 3,341 years . Replica: The team, backed by a multinational team of museums, has worked for years to reconstruct the tomb in the hope that they can close the original . It will have exactly the same floor, ceiling, walls, gate, lights, sarcophagus and lid. Scientists are also working to ensure the temperature is the same - but have had to wait until visitors started to arrive to accurately calculate the humidity. He added: 'The most important thing is really sound. 'We have tried to ensure that the acoustics are similar - I have an acoustic archaeologist in my team - but this area of work needs more attention.' In a hall between the burial chamber and an antechamber hang photos and explanations of the discovery of the tomb and its treasures. The original casket (left) was intricately designed by Egyptians in 1327 for their revered 19-year-old leader, and has now been replicated exactly in similar material (right) Here, the first panels of the facsimile are erected in the underground chamber prepared near Carter House in the US by a multinational team of museums . The fascination with Carter's story and the perpetual promise of more discoveries has seen tourists pouring into the sun-drenched site although there has been a significant dip in tourism this year as the country has suffered from ongoing political protests. Lowe, is hopeful that the replica will become as popular as the original as visitors 'become part of the force that protects it [the original] rather than a force that is leading to its destruction.' He told the BBC: 'They will have the thrill of visiting something they know is 3,000 years old and they have the guilt of knowing, as they look at it, that their presence is part of the reason why it won't be there in another 100 years' time.'","Opulent chamber lay undetected for until 1922, when it was discovered by British archaeologist Howard Carter .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Listening to local radio can cause robins to lose their way. Biologists have proved that the electromagnetic ‘noise’ from AM radio transmitters interferes with the Earth’s magnetic field, which migratory birds use to navigate. The problem is thought to affect birds in urban areas more as there is less interference in the countryside. Lost in music: Biologists have proved that the electromagnetic 'noise' from AM radio transmitters interferes with the Earth's magnetic field, which migratory birds such as robins (pictured) use to navigate . The study led by Professor Henrik Mouritsen of the University of Oldenburg, Germany, has proved for the first time that the magnetic compass of robins fails entirely when the birds are exposed to AM radio waveband electromagnetic interference - even if the signals are just a thousandth of the limit value defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as 'harmless'. The findings, published in the journal Nature, are based on seven years of research by the scientists, in cooperation with Professor Peter Hore of Oxford University. ‘In our experiments we were able to document a clear and reproducible effect of human-made electromagnetic fields on a vertebrate,’ Professor Mouritsen said. ‘This interference does not stem from power lines or mobile phone networks’ but is generated by electronic devices like AM radio transmitters. ‘The effects of these weak electromagnetic fields are remarkable: they disrupt the functioning of an entire sensory system in a healthy higher vertebrate.’ Expert navigators: It has been known that migratory birds navigate the planet using the Earth¿s magnetic field to find their way for around 50 years. Biologists have proven this in numerous experiments in which they tested the birds' navigation abilities in so-called orientation cages . It has been known for 50 years that migratory birds navigate the planet using the Earth’s magnetic field. Biologists have proved this in numerous experiments in which they tested the birds' navigation abilities in so-called orientation cages. ‘So we were surprised when robins kept in wooden huts on the Oldenburg University campus were unable to use their magnetic compass,’ Professor Mouritsen said. Dr Nils-Lasse Schneider, an electrophysiologist proposed covering the wooden huts, along with the orientation cages they contained, with sheets of aluminium to see if this made a difference. It did not affect the Earth's magnetic field, which is vital for the birds to navigate, but it greatly reduced the electromagnetic interference – also known as electrosmog – inside the huts. The scientists found that the birds' orientation problems disappeared. ‘Our measurements of the interferences indicated that we had accidentally discovered a biological system that is sensitive to anthropogenic electromagnetic noise generated by humans in the frequency range up to five megahertz,' Professor Mouritsen explained. Scrambled compass: The electromagnetic broadband interference is present in all urban environments, presenting a navigational challenge to migratory birds (pictured). The problem lessened in rural areas so the issue is localised . He was surprised that the intensity of the interference was far below the limits defined by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection and the WHO. The team performed a large number of experiments to explore the effect that they observed. ‘Over the course of seven years we carried out numerous experiments and collected reliable evidence in order to be absolutely certain that the effect actually exists,’ Professor Mouritsen said. Students conducted the same experiments without knowledge of previous results and proved that as soon as electromagnetic interference was deliberately created inside the aluminium-clad and earthed wooden huts, the birds' magnetic orientation ability was immediately lost again. The scientists were able to show that the disruptive effects were generated by electromagnetic fields that cover a much broader frequency range at a much lower intensity than previous studies had suggested. And this electromagnetic broadband interference is present in all urban environments, presenting a navigational challenge to migratory birds. The problem lessened in rural areas so the issue is localised. ‘However these findings should make us think – both about the survival of migratory birds as well as about the potential effects for human beings, which have yet to be investigated,’ Professor Mouritsen said.","Scientists from the University of Oldenburg, Germany, said electromagnetic noise from AM radio transmitters affects migratory birds .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A rare bee thought to be extinct in the UK since 1946 has been rediscovered in Kent by a wildlife photographer. Roger Tidman, 66, was in Dungeness when he unknowingly spotted a female Andrena vaga bee carrying pollen. But although Mr Tidman was drawn to the striking grey-haired insect because of its colour, he had no idea it was so rare. The unique Andrena vaga bee, commonly known as the mining bee, was last spotted on British soil 68 years ago - but has now been spotted by wildlife photographer Roger Tidman off the Kent coast . Mr Tidman, 66, from Briston, Norfolk, was immediately drawn towards the bee, but had no idea it was so rare until he showed the photo to his friend Nick Owens, a bee expert . It was only when Mr Tidman showed the photo to his close friend Nick Owens, a bee expert, that the true identity of the bee was revealed. Unbeknown to Mr Tidman, the bee had last been seen on British soil 68 years earlier and was even considered by experts to be extinct. Mr Tidman, from Briston, Norfolk, was over the moon when he realised he had spotted an incredibly rare species. He said: 'I had no idea it was so rare, but it turns out it has not been since in the UK since 1946. 'I'm not a bee expert, but my close friend Nick Owens is and when I showed him the picture he said: 'You've hit the jackpot, mate!' 'He explained that this bee was declared extinct in the UK 68 years ago and that he couldn't believe it was back in England. The keen photographer spotted the distinctively grey-haired insect carrying pollen before burying it underground . The bee, which is more regularly seen across the Channel in France, is only one-and-a-half centimetres long . Mr Tidman wanted to call the bee by an easier name so has named it the grey-backed mining bee . The bees that populate Britain today were mostly introduced from abroad - including the popular honeybee. In total, there are around 250 species of bees . in the UK. These include 25 species of bumblebees, . around 225 species of solitary bee and just a single honeybee species. Although bees are not a protected species, they are incredibly important to the UK. They pollinate fruit and vegetable plants - making them worth £560m a . year to the UK economy. They are a critical part of the food . chain because flowering plants depend on insects for pollination. The honeybee is the most effective. Nationally, seven of the UK’s 25 native bumblebee species are in decline. Two have become extinct, including the short-haired bumblebee. But sightings of rare bees, including the . ruderal bumblebee, the red shanked carder bee, the moss carder bee and . the brown-banded carder bee, have increased. 'It was very exciting when he told me how rare the bee is and when I realised I could be the only person with a clear picture of it, I was thrilled.' Mr Tidman, who has been a wildlife photographer since the late 1970s, said the bee's return was probably due to global warming. He said the energetic insect had most likely flown across the English Channel from France, where it is more regularly seen. He said: 'It is called the Andrena vaga, but I wanted to call it something easier to understand so I've named it the 'grey-backed mining bee'. 'Hopefully this common name will make it easier for children to understand so they can get involved and interested in nature. 'Because it is a mining bee, the female was flying around to gather pollen before burying it underground. 'It has a grey back, and looks like a small bumble bee, but it is only one-and-a-half centimetres long. 'Anyone who has knowledge of bees would have been able to tell it was something completely different and incredibly rare.' Bees are a critical part of the food chain because flowering plants depend on insects for pollination. The honeybee is the most effective. It pollinates 90 commercial crops . worldwide, including most fruit and vegetables, alfalfa for cattle feed, nuts and cotton.","The Andrena vaga bee, known as the mining bee, last spotted 68 years ago .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . For the first time in millennia, the average level of carbon dioxide has topped 400 parts per million (ppm) for an entire month. April’s carbon dioxide readings come less than a year after scientists warned that the amount of the gas in the Earth’s atmosphere could surpass the 400ppm marker and stay there. The gas is considered by many scientists to be responsible for global warming and has consistently breached the mark for a month – likely for the first time in 800,000 years. An unfortunate first: For the first time in human history, the average level of carbon dioxide has topped 400 parts per million (ppm) for an entire month. Many scientists think that the burning of fossil fuels and other material (pictured) is responsible for global warming . Climate change is already having an impact on every part of the US, according to a doom-laden report published by the Obama administration earlier this week. The third U.S. National Climate Assessment says the number and strength of extreme weather events have increased over the past 50 years. President Obama is set to use the paper to convince the American public on the need for a crackdown on greenhouse gas emissions. The report, compiled by 300 experts and released by the White House, said: ‘Climate change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present. 'More than half the US population lives in coastal areas that are ‘increasingly vulnerable’ to the effects of climate change, the report said. And efforts to cut emissions so far are ‘insufficient to avoid increasingly negative social, environmental, and economic consequences’, it concluded. April’s average carbon dioxide reading was 401.33ppm, according to scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego. The institution is the custodian of the longest continuous record of carbon dioxide measurements, which were started in the 1950s by Charles David Keeling on the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii, USA Today reported. The ‘Keeling curve’ measurements are thought to be representative of carbon dioxide levels around the world. Rising levels of the gas in the atmosphere are thought to be caused by the burning of fossil fuels and are claimed to be responsible for the warming of the planet. Based on ice core samples  from the . Antarctic ice sheet that preserve samples of old air, experts from . Scripps said that carbon dioxide levels did not breach 300ppm prior to . the industrial revolution for the past 800,000 years. Earth probably had carbon dioxide . levels of 280ppm before the Industrial Revolution experts said, and the reading was 316ppm when the Keeling curve began in the 1950s.

The Earth probably had carbon dioxide levels of 280ppm before the Industrial Revolution experts said . However, while carbon dioxide levels are expected to remain consistently above 400ppm throughout this month, scientists expect them to drop slightly when plants die in autumn.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The ancient Egyptians believed that when a person died, parts of their soul known as ka – a body double - and the ba – a person’s personality - would go to the Kingdom of the Dead. And now a tomb with a remarkable painting of the afterlife has been uncovered. It dates back to around 1,100BC and was uncovered in Saqqara, around 18 miles (30km) south of Cairo, according to Egypt's Antiquities Ministry. Discovered: A tomb dating back to around 1,100BC with a remarkable painting of a funerary procession (pictured) and the afterlife has been uncovered. Here, the guard's three sons make offerings to their seated parents. Paser's title can be read and a monkey (top left) perhaps indicates that the guard was married - although it could be a pet . The ancient Egyptian afterlife is one of the earliest known recorded belief systems in history. People believed that when a person died their soul known as ka - or body double - and the ba - their personality - would go to the Kingdom of the Dead. While their soul stayed in the Fields of Aaru, Osiris - the god of the afterlife - demanded work in return for his protection, which is why you often see farming scenes inside tombs. Statues were placed in tombs to serve as substitutes for a person. In order to reach the afterlife, a person had to have a pure heart as well as recite passwords, spells and forumlae from the Book of the Dead. People believed that in the Hall of Two truths the heart was weighed and if it was lighter than the Shu feather, they could pass on - or be destroyed by a demon. Mummification and the sarcophagus was a requirement for being able to access the afterlife and the Fields of Yalu. The 'opening of the mouth' ceremony was of importance as well as the presence of objects such as jewellery to keep a body safe on its dangerous journey. The tomb belongs to a guard of the army archives and royal messenger to foreign countries, Egyptian Antiquities Minister Mohamed Ibrahim said. Chris Eyre, professor of Egyptology at the University of Liverpool’s School of Archaeology, Classics and Egyptology (SACE) deciphered hieroglyphs for MailOnine and said that the guard's name is Paser. While his name might be common at the time, he was of high rank, shown by the elaborate tomb and its expensive bright blue decoration. The tomb contains a brightly coloured painting of the afterlife and several inscriptions. It measures 12 metres long and six metres wide and was discovered by Cairo University’s Faculty of Archaeology. It can be . dated back to the end of the Ramesside period, which is named after the . eleven kings with the name Ramesses, who ruled in the Nineteenth to the . Twentieth Dynasties. Ola . el-Egeizy, of the Cairo University said the tomb contains ‘very nice . inscriptions’ of the funerary procession and the afterlife of the . deceased. Professor Eyres said that is 'remarkable' that the full height of the wall is preserved, which is 'very unusual' for this type of open courtyard tomb. The structure was found near another one . dating back to the same period, which belongs to the head of the army. It . was discovered in the previous excavation season. The tomb belongs to a guard of the army archives and royal messenger to foreign countries, Antiquities Minister Mohamed Ibrahim said. In this image, the guard (right) is adoring Osiris (left with the crook), shown as he is placing his palms towards the god. Offerings of food - perhaps loaves (which look a bit like doughnuts), water in a vessel with a spout and meat, can be seen on a table . The site, pictured, was uncovered in Saqqara, around 18 miles (30km) south of Cairo, according to Egypt's Antiquities Ministry . That tomb is larger but much of what remains is mud bricks as 'most of its stone blocks were stolen and many of them are in museums all over the world,' said Mr el-Egeizy. Because of the blocks, archaeologists had long known that the tomb of the messenger existed, although it was not uncovered until recently. One panel shows the god of the afterlife Osiris and with other figures processing with objects integral to the body's wellbeing for eternal life. Another panel pays tribute to the guard in life, showing his three sons offering him items such as incense and a monkey can be seen, which might have been a pet. Hieroglyphs spell out the man's title as 'chief of people who look after writings of the army,' Professor Eyre explained. Ola el-Egeizy of the University of Cairo said the tomb contains 'very nice inscriptions' of the funerary procession and the afterlife of the deceased. The central part of the image is drawn as if it were a shrine and bears the name of the guard - Paser on the bottom of the 'frame'. The god of the underworld, Osiris, is pictured on the right of the panel in a shrine and the guard is offering him incense and water . The tomb contains a brightly coloured painting of what could be the afterlife. The blue colouring was difficult and expensive to produce, indicating that Paser was of high social standing. Here, his charioteer brother beings offerings to place on the blue table, which is already laden with loaves, lotuses and a dangling milkpot . One of the wall decorations is drawn as if it was a shrine and bears the name of the guard - Paser. Despite being an important bureaucrat, it is not known if his name appears on other contemporary monuments, but as Saqarra was 'excavated' by early Egyptologists in the 18th century, there is a chance that artefacts that fit with the tomb will turn up in museum collections. 'Once a tomb emerges lots of museums find they have a bit here and there - but Paser is not particularly well known at this point,' Professor Eyre said. many tombs have images of processions which show family members carrying objects needed in the afterlife, such as intense and water. Paser's brother, Setti, who was a charioteer, carries a teapot-like vessel containing water, as the ancient Egyptians believed people needed a clean heart to be granted eternal life. A standard bearer from the army follows closely behind, although it is hard to tell whether the objects will be used to prepare Paser for his journey, or whether the scene is from the afterlife. 'The grammar of the inscriptions makes it unclear if people are dead or not,' professor Eyre explained. 'It's hard to know if this is a funeral of the afterlife. There's a deep continuity between this life and the next.' Saqqara was the necropolis for the ancient Egyptian city of Memphis and site of the oldest known pyramid in Egypt. Here, workers dig at the site of the newly-found tomb in the hope of uncovering fresh evidence of the Ramesside period . The tomb, pictured, is of open courtyard style and can be dated back to the end of the Ramesside period, which is named after the eleven kings with the name Ramesses, who ruled in the Nineteenth to the Twentieth Dynasties. Here, a man works on a wall inside the tomb of the head of the army archives . Mr Ibrahim said that the discovery of the tomb adds ‘a chapter to our knowledge about the history of Saqqara’. Saqqara was the necropolis for the ancient Egyptian city of Memphis and site of the oldest known pyramid in Egypt. The occupant of the tomb lived during a time characterised by great wars. Many of the events and instances of everyday life were carefully documented by scribes, including strikes by tomb workers. The tomb dates back to around 1,100BC and was uncovered in Saqqara (marked), around 18 miles (30km) south of Cairo, according to Egypt's Antiquities Ministry .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . It’s regarded as one of most promising places for alien life in the solar system. But missions to Europa have been few and far between, with many questions about this frozen moon still left unanswered. Now in an effort to carry out some key research on Jupiter's moon, Nasa is finally looking at proposals – but they’re sticking to a tight budget. Nasa is now accepting mission proposals to explore Jupiter's icy moon Europa. In this image, taken by Voyager 2 as it flew by on 9 July 1979, can be seen chaos terrain, faults and ridges that are almost certaintly the result of a vast, ice-capped global ocean underground . Nasa issued the Request for Information (RFI) to science and engineering communities for ideas for a mission to Europa to be submitted by 30 May. The RFI's focus is for concepts for a mission to Europa that costs less than $1 billion (£590 million), excluding the rocket that would take them into space. Each mission proposal must aim to meet as many of the science priorities as possible recommended by the National Research Council's 2011 Planetary Science Decadal Survey for the study of Europa. ‘This is an opportunity to hear from those creative teams that have ideas on how we can achieve the most science at minimum cost,’ said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for the Nasa Science Mission Directorate at the agency's headquarters in Washington. ‘Europa is one of the most interesting sites in our solar system in the search for life beyond Earth. ‘The drive to explore Europa has stimulated not only scientific interest but also the ingenuity of engineers and scientists with innovative concepts.’ Nasa has studied a variety of mission designs and concepts in previous years and currently is funding the development of technologies that will be needed for the science instruments for a Europa mission. The Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey is a review of astronomy and astrophysics literature produced every 10 years. It recommends research priorities for the coming decade based on the review. The 2011 Decadal Survey deemed a mission to Jupiter moon’s Europa as among the highest priority scientific pursuits for Nasa. It . lists five key science objectives in priority order that are necessary . to improve our understanding of this potentially habitable moon. The mission will need to: . • Characterise the extent of the ocean and its relation to the deeper interior. • . Characterise the ice shell and any subsurface water, and see how they interact. • Determine global surface compositions and chemistry, especially with regards to habitability. • . Understand the formation of surface features, including sites of recent . or current activity, and identify and characterise candidate sites for . future detailed exploration. • Understand Europa's space environment and interaction with Jupiter's magnetosphere. There have been various proposals to explore Europa over the years, such as the Cryobot (pictured) which would be taken underground by a larger drill before it was then released into the ocean, searching for signs of past or present alien life . Congress appropriated $80 million (£47 million) for this work in the Nasa’s last budget, while the most recent budget proposal requests an additional $15 million (£9 million). Previous scientific findings point to the existence of a liquid water ocean located under the moon's icy crust. This ocean covers Europa entirely and contains more liquid water than all of Earth's oceans combined. Although Europa and Jupiter's other moons have been visited by other spacecraft, they were each limited to a single distant flyby of these satellites. Nasa’s Galileo spacecraft, launched in 1989 by the space shuttle, was the only mission to make repeated visits to Europa, passing close by the moon fewer than a dozen times. In December 2013, Nasa’s Hubble Space Telescope observed water vapour above the moon's frigid south polar region. This provided the first strong evidence of water plumes erupting off the moon's surface, and a spacecraft could even be designed to fly through the plumes to make measurements of the composition of the underground ocean. Any . mission to Europa must take into account the harsh radiation environment . that would require unique protection of the spacecraft and instruments. In addition, spacecraft must meet planetary protection requirements intended to protect Europa's potentially habitable ocean. These requirements are very strict and involve ensuring that a viable Earth organism is not introduced into the Europa ocean. Water plumes seen spouting from the surface provide evidence for the existence of a vast ocean beneath Europa. It is thought the moon holds more water than all the oceans and sea on Earth combined, making it one of the most attractive science destinations in the solar system . The last spacecraft to visit Europa was New Horizons (artist's illustration shown), which flew past the icy moon in 2007. The Nasa vehicle is now on its way to Pluto, which it will arrive at in July 2015 .","Nasa is now accepting proposals for missions to explore Jupiter's moon .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Electric cars have been silently taking over our garages, streets and cities. But while the vehicles may be good for the planet, some people are concerned their magnetic fields may not be good for a driver’s health. Now a seven-country study argues that these concerns are unfounded with evidence to suggest electric cars do not generate electromagnetic fields higher than the dose recommended. When electric cars first began appearing on our roads, some people were worried about the dangers of electromagnetic fields (EMF) that might affect drivers. Now a seven-country study has found that the magnetic fields in electric vehicles pose no danger as their EMF levels are below recommended standards . The dangers of electromagnetic fields in hybrid and electric vehicles began emerging on internet forums as soon as the first car began appearing on our roads. The flow of electrical current to the motor that moves a hybrid vehicle produces electromagnetic fields (EMF). A number of studies have linked EMF exposure with serious health issues, including a possible risk of cancer, miscarriage and a higher risk of leukaemia among children. Batteries and power cables in electric and hybrid vehicles are usually placed close to the driver and passengers, meaning that prolonged exposure to electromagnetic fields is unavoidable. The highest values of electromagnetic exposure in electric cars were measured near the floor, close to the battery itself and when starting the cars. In all cases, exposure to magnetic fields was lower than 20 per cent of the value recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) ‘Some members of the public have attributed a diffuse collection of symptoms to low levels of exposure to electromagnetic fields at home,’ according to the World Health Organisation. The flow of electrical current to the motor that moves a hybrid vehicle or electric produces electromagnetic fields (EMF). A number of studies have linked EMF exposure with serious health issues, including a possible risk cancer, miscarriage and a higher risk of leukaemia among children. Batteries and power cables in electric and hybrid vehicles are usually placed close to the driver and passengers, meaning that prolonged exposure to electromagnetic fields is unavoidable. ‘Some members of the public have attributed a diffuse collection of symptoms to low levels of exposure to electromagnetic fields at home,’ according to the World Health Organisation. ‘Reported symptoms include headaches, anxiety, suicide and depression, nausea, fatigue and loss of libido, sleep disorders, headaches, tiredness, concentration and memory problems.’ ‘Reported symptoms include headaches, anxiety, suicide and depression, nausea, fatigue and loss of libido, sleep disorders, headaches, tiredness, concentration and memory problems.’ According to a report by Jim Motavalli in the New York Times, a number of hybrid owners tested their cars for electromagnetic fields using hand-held meters and were alarmed by the results. But the latest study, led by Norway-based Sintef, argues these concerns have been blown out of proportion. EMF levels in seven different electric cars, one hydrogen-powered car, two petrol-fuelled cars and one diesel-fuelled car were measured in the laboratory and during road tests. The highest values of electromagnetic exposure in electric cars were measured near the floor, close to the battery itself and when starting the cars. In all cases, exposure to magnetic fields was lower than 20 per cent of the value recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). Sensors picked up a burst of radiation that same level, when the cars were started. Measurements taken at head-height - using a test dummy with sensors located in the head, chest and feet - were shown to be less than two per cent of the recommended value. The flow of electrical current to the motor that moves a hybrid vehicle or electric produces electromagnetic fields (EMF). A number of studies have linked EMF exposure with serious health issues, including a possible risk cancer, miscarriage, depression and a higher risk of leukaemia among children . In the case of petrol and diesel powered cars, exposure was measured at around 10 per cent of the exposure levels considered to be safe. ‘There is absolutely no cause for concern,’ said Kari Schjolberg-Henriksen, a physicist at Sintef. ‘The difference between this research and similar earlier work is that we have taken into account what contributes to the magnetic fields. ‘The rotation of the wheels themselves generates considerable magnetic fields, irrespective of vehicle type.’ The EU-funded research project EM Safety is the most comprehensive study yet carried out to identify different sources of magnetic fields in electric cars.","Flow of electrical current to motor produces electromagnetic fields (EMF)

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Powering down a runway in an aeroplane could be a thing of the past - for the rich and famous at least - if this concept for a personal aircraft takes off. A team of engineers who specialise in the design of wind-energy turbines have designed a small electric aeroplane that can take off vertically. Its lift off would be similar to a helicopter’s, but once airborne, the S2 aircraft’s 12 rotor blade motors fold up so it can glide along like a conventional plane. Scroll down for video . Up, up and away! A team of engineers usually intent upon designing wind energy turbines have come up with a small electric airplane that can take off vertically (illustrated) Electric motors: Light, powerful and reliable motors will provide the propulsion for the aircraft. Blades: 12 helicopter-style rotor blades will provide vertical lift and then swivel and fold up so the aircraft can fly as a plane. Batteries: The next generation of lithium polymer batteries will supply the power for the vehicle and are said to be more efficient than using conventional fuel. Sensors: Technologies developed for consumer electronics like smartphones provide sensing capabilities once reserved for rockets all on a circuit board the size of a postage stamp. Entrepreneur JoeBen Bevirt has not yet built a full scale prototype of the S2, but around 24 10lb (4.5kg) models exist to prove the design works. The models have piqued the interest of Nasa, which is now funding the development of a 55lb (25kg) version. Joby Aviation, the firm behind the design, which is based in Santa Cruz, California, has produced supercomputer simulations of a 1,700lb (770kg) full-scale S2 aircraft and claim it should be able to fly two people between New York City and Boston – a 200mile (322km) journey – in just one hour. Soaring through the skies: It's take off might be similar to a helicopter's, but once airborne, the S2 aircraft's 12 propellers fold up so it can glide like an aeroplane (illustrated in this computer simulation) Distinctive: The S2's most striking feature is its retractable arms that reposition the motors from a horizontal position like a helicopter (pictured) to take off vertically, to folding up for aerodynamic flight . Such a trip would require 50kilowatt-hours of electricity, which would make it around five times more efficient that a personal aeroplane burning approximately one-and-a-half gallons of fuel. Mr Bevirt told Popsci that the plane would not have been possible a decade ago, but compact and efficient motors, increasingly power dense batteries, smart control systems and ever tinier sensors mean that the S2 could soon take to the skies. Its most noticeable feature is retractable arms that reposition the motors from a horizontal position - like a helicopter to take off vertically - to folding up for aerodynamic flight. Computers can adjust the speed of the motors 4,000 times per second to optimise efficiency, reduce noise and improve flight control, according to the firm. The models demonstrate that 12 compact electric motors work three times as efficiently as combustion engines on personal airplanes, which could make the S2 a safer way for the rich and famous to travel in the future, the company said.

Safer? Models of the aircraft have demonstrated that its 12 compact electric motors work three times as efficiently as combustion engines on personal airplanes, which could make the S2 a safer way for the rich and famous to travel in the future . While the S2 is currently a number of models, Rolls-Royce has developed the world’s first short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) system capable of powering a supersonic aircraft - the Joint Strike Fighter. It is the successor of the famous Harrier jet and its LiftSystem is so powerful it could lift 17 Mini cars. They system claims to make operations safer for pilots, enabling the plane to hover like a helicopter and take off vertically. The fighter jet is the third STOVL aircraft to go into production, but unlike the proposed S2, it needs a very short run-up on a runway to take off before it can hover. The LiftSystem is a dramatic improvement on the previous one as it has twice the capability of a Harrier jet, while being able to travel faster and further. Replacing the ageing fleet of Tornados and the now-retired Harrier fleet, the Joint Strike Fighter will give the Royal Air Force an all weather aircraft with day and night capability, which is able to operate from air bases or the Queen Elizabeth Class Aircraft Carriers. The innovation has been shortlisted for the Royal Academy of Engineering’s MacRobert Award - the UK’s longest running national prize for engineering. The first Joint Strike Fighter equipped with the Rolls-Royce LiftSystem was delivered in January 2012 and the fleet has now grown to 42.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Atmospheric CO2 levels are expected to be significantly elevated by around 2050. And researchers have warned that crops that provide the global population with most of their dietary zinc and iron will be affected. That's according to a new study led by the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH), who say plants will have . significantly reduced concentrations of those nutrients. A new study from the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) says plants will be significantly less nutritious by 2050 if levels of carbon dioxide continue to elevate . An estimated two billion . people suffer from zinc and iron deficiencies. This results in a loss of 63 . million life years annually from malnutrition. Thus the reduction in these . nutrients represents the most significant health threat ever shown to be . associated with climate change, says the HSPH. 'This study is the first to resolve the question of whether rising CO2 concentrations - which have been increasing steadily since the Industrial Revolution - threaten human nutrition,' said Samuel Myers, research scientist in the Department of Environmental Health at the HSPH and the study's lead author. Some previous studies of crops grown in greenhouses and chambers at elevated CO2 had found nutrient reductions, but those studies were criticised for using artificial growing conditions. Experiments . using free air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) technology became the . gold standard as FACE allowed plants to be grown in open fields at . elevated levels of CO2, but those prior studies had small sample sizes . and have been inconclusive. This study now, however, shows that the loss of iron and zinc from grains and legumes at elevated CO2 is significant. In the study they found that grains and legumes lost significant amounts of iron and zinc at elevated levesl of CO2. The researchers say two to three billion people around the world receive 70% of their dietary zinc and/or iron from crops like these . Myers and his colleagues estimate that two to three billion people around the world receive 70% or more of their dietary zinc and/or iron from C3 crops, particularly in the developing world, where zinc and iron deficiency is already a major health concern. C4 plants are those that have long growing seasons and spend a lot of time in the sun. C3 plants, meanwhile, are found in a broader range of environments. In the study C4 crops appeared to be less affected by higher CO2, which is consistent with underlying plant physiology. This is because C4 plants concentrate CO2 inside the cell for photosynthesis so they might be expected to be less sensitive to changes outside the cell in CO2 concentration. But the researchers were surprised to find that zinc and iron varied substantially across cultivars (plants chosen for their desirable characteristics) of rice. That finding suggests that there could be an opportunity to breed reduced sensitivity to the effect of elevated CO2 into crop cultivars in the future. In addition to efforts to reduce CO2 emissions, genetically engineering crops to increase their nutritional value (known as biofortification) with regards to iron and zing could reduce the human health impacts of these changes, said Myers. He also suggests we could breed cultivars with reduced sensitivity to CO2 and provide nutritional supplementation for the populations most impacted if rising CO2 levels cannot be quelled. 'Humanity is conducting a global experiment by rapidly altering the environmental conditions on the only habitable planet we know,' he said. 'As this experiment unfolds, there will undoubtedly be many surprises. 'Finding out that rising CO2 threatens human nutrition is one such surprise.' The researchers analysed . data involving 41 cultivars (plants chosen for their desirable . characteristics) of grains and legumes from the C3 and C4 functional . groups from seven different FACE locations in Japan, Australia, and the United States. C4 plants are those that have long growing seasons and spend a lot of time in the sun. C3 plants, meanwhile, are found in a broader range of environments. The . C denotes carbon and the different photosynthesis processes; C3 plants . convert atmospheric carbon into a chemical compound with four carbon . atoms, while C3 plants convert one into three. The level of CO2 across all seven sites was in the range of 546-586 parts per million (ppm). They . tested the nutrient concentrations of the edible portions of wheat and . rice (C3 grains), maize and sorghum (C4 grains) and soybeans and field . peas (C3 legumes). The results showed a significant decrease in the concentrations of zinc, iron, and protein in C3 grains. For example, zinc, iron and protein concentrations in wheat grains grown at the FACE sites were reduced by 9.3 per cent, 5.1 per cent and 6.3 per cent respectively, compared with wheat grown at ambient CO2. Zinc and iron were also significantly reduced in legumes, although protein was not. The finding that C3 grains and legumes lost iron and zinc at elevated CO2 is significant, says the HSPH.","Harvard School of Public Health says food will lose key nutrients by 2050 .

"By . Joshua Gardner . Dramatic dash cam footage shows the terrifying moment a woman's Toyota pickup violently veers into another woman's car on a California freeway last weekend. Police are now investigating whether Stephanie Pontarolo, 33, was after rogue highway justice when her truck smashed into 21-year-old dental assistant Kelsey Shakespeare's car on Saturday. If it does turn out to be a case of road rage, Pontarolo is likely now kicking herself with the one foot she didn't injure after her truck--not Shakespeare's Volkswagen--flipped completely over in the collision. Renegade highway justice? Dramatic dash cam footage shows the shocking collision between a Toyota pickup and a Volkswagen Jetta on a San Diego freeway last Saturday in what police are now saying could potentially be an act of road rage . Unlikely standoff? Stephanie Pontarolo, 33 (left), was behind the wheel of the truck that smashed into the Volkswagen driven by 21-year-old Kelsey Shakespeare (right) at nearly a 90-degree angle . In addition to her foot, Pontarolo suffered lacerations on her face and arm while Shakespeare complained of back pain, according to a California Highway Patrol news release. The driver whose dash cam caught the shocking episode told police that the altercation began when Shakespeare cut off Pontarolo on I-8 in San Diego, reports KTLA. In the tense seconds that are subsequently caught on camera, the green pickup truck speeds up beside the Jetta before ramming it at a nearly 90 degree angle. Just before the incident: Some reports have suggested the the incident began when Shakespeare cut off Pontarolo in her truck . Many dangers: A few tense seconds later and the truck is nearly perpendicular to Shakespeare's car as a tanker truck speeds down the freeway behind them . Moments later, both cars have miraculously veered into the highway shoulder and avoided oncoming traffic. But the damage hasn't all been done . Flipping out: In an ironic twist--if she was in fact acting out of rage--it's Pontarolo's truck that flips over in a cloud of dust as Shakespeare's car keeps all four wheels on the ground . Both vehicles swerve across lanes of traffic and onto the shoulder where Pontarolo's truck flips completely over while Shakespeare's car keeps all four tires on the ground. A tanker truck was just behind the collision in the far right lane and narrowly avoided smashing into the vehicles, notes KTLA. According to KSWB, CHP at first called the incident an accidental collision. However, if they discover that Pontarolo is at fault and was out for revenge, she could be headed for the courtroom. 'If it is determined through our investigation that there was an intentional act to harm another person, this incident would not be treated as a collision and separate charges would follow,' reads the CHP news release. If that happens, California Highway Patrol authorities say Pontarolo could face charges as serious attempted murder. A California Highway Patrol statement reveals that Pontarolo (seen at left in a preview meth-related arrest photo) suffered lacerations on her foot, face and arm while Shakespeare complained of back pain following the crash .

"By . Ryan Lipman . A human head and a decapitated torso discovered 45 kilometres apart in regional Queensland do not belong to the same person, police have revealed. Tests have determined the adult head and the previously discovered torso found near Gympie are from different bodies. Toolara Forestry workers, who were clearing at the time, found the head in a tree plantation about 1km off Cooloola Coast Rd on April 11. The torso was discovered on Cedar Pocket Rd on September 19, 2013. Scroll down for video . Unsolved mystery: A torso, found on Cedar Pocket Rd, pictured, in September 2013, does not match a head found just 45km away in April . On Wednesday, Detective Inspector Bruce McNab said tests proved the head and torso do not match, the Courier Mail reported. The grim discovery of the torso left Gympie, with a population of about 18,000, horrified when it was found burning on the side of the road. The torso was decapitated above the collarbone and below the rib cage and had its hands gruesomely hacked off at the wrist. Tests indicated the torso belonged to an athletic man, who was taking medication for high blood pressure, malaria, cramps and restless leg syndrome. He is believed to have been aged between 40 and 80, of a solid build and between 180cm and 190cm. There were no tattoos on his upper chest and there was no match on the DNA database, which means he had no criminal history. The torso revealed a 3cm scar on the right side of the man's back, about halfway down, from an old injury. Since the find, there have been no reports of a missing person despite public appeals for information. Cadaver dogs have also been used as part of police investigations. Clues: A burnt towel was found near the the burning torso . With the mystery baffling Queensland police, the FBI and international forensic experts are being used to help solve the case. Last month, Insp McNab said items of interest had been discovered in the search of Toolara State Forest, but could not reveal what they were. 'We have found some other items of interest during the search we have done of the area and we are still searching there,' he said. 'We are not able to say what those items are.' The charred towel found near the torso was wrapped in tarp-like material. A plain-coloured T-shirt was also found. Police are looking for a female suspect, described as small to medium build, middle aged, with blonde to brown shoulder-length hair. Call for help: Queensland police are asking for public assistance with the ongoing investigations . It is believed she was wearing black exercise pants to her knee and driving an orange to brown hatchback. Sighted in the Gympie area for about an hour on the night of September 19, the woman was seen at her car on the side of Cedar Creek Rd, outside the town's centre. Police have been able to piece together details about her movements, with passing drivers seeing her in the driver’s seat of the car and also standing next to the front passenger door. The woman was also seen leaning over a grass area near the road's edge but kept her head down, with her back to the road. At 6.30pm, shortly after she left the area, passing motorists saw a fire at the same grass area. The fire revealed a burning torso, which had been doused in an ­accelerant and set alight. Insp McNab said investigations into the gruesome discoveries human body parts remains were ongoing. 'We continue to appeal to anyone who has any information on either of these incidents to come forward,' he said. Anyone with information should contact Crime Stoppers anonymously via 1800 333 000 or crimestoppers.com.au . Crime scene: The area pictured, is where the headless torso was discovered.

"By . Hugo Gye . The bus driver was caught on camera using a mobile phone while driving the vehicle full of passengers through Sheffield . A bus driver has been fired after he was caught on camera talking on his mobile phone for several minutes while in control of his vehicle. The driver had only one hand on the steering wheel for most of the journey - but at times he took both hands off the wheel while waving at other motorists or scratching his head. After passenger Anna Williams, a young mother travelling with her two children, handed mobile phone footage of the incident to the bus operator, the reckless driver was sacked. During the journey through Sheffield, the driver - who has not been named - negotiated busy rounabouts and skirted past parked cars while talking on the phone. When he stopped the bus to let Ms Williams off, she told him that she had captured the whole journey on the phone, and promptly sent the video to TM Travel, the company which runs the bus route. 'Sometimes he didn't even have his hands on the wheel,' she said. 'He was scratching his head and driving along, opening his window and putting his hand out to say thank you to other drivers. 'He just had no concern at all for the public or anyone he was carrying on the bus. 'I expected him to end the call before he started the journey.

'He travelled at 30 mph - it's a bit of a rough bus journey to start off with, without being on your mobile phone!' Ms Williams said she felt powerless to challenge him, but realised she had to let the company know how the driver had behaved. Footage showed the driver had only one hand on the steering wheel for most of the journey through Sheffield . 'I phoned the bus company up straight away as soon as I got to my destination,' she said. 'Obviously they said they weren't very happy about it and so they said he would be suspended pending further investigations. 'I understand he has now lost his job. I am satisfied with that, but to be honest I think it should be referred to the police because it is a criminal matter.' Phil Stockley, the general manager of TM Travel, said he was 'shocked and upset' to be handed the footage. 'We were extremely shocked and upset to see one of our drivers behaving in that fashion,' he said. 'We pride ourselves on employing highly professional, very skilled drivers and they, in turn, like to set a good standard and a good image for their profession. We are all very upset to think that any of our staff would behave in that way. 'Clearly the driver has done something he shouldn't do and he has been dealt with accordingly.

'I've shot a lot of pigs': Antonio Arroja, father of the woman (pictured) at the centre of the Mitchell Pearce nightclub saga says he's furious . Although the internal investigation conducted by NSW Police has not led to further legal action due to Ms Arroja choosing not to make a formal statement to detectives, the Sydney Roosters handed out their own penalties to Pearce on Tuesday. The footballer has been stood down from a single match and fined $20,000 which will be donated to charity. He's also expected to complete a counseling program. However he will be free to play in the May 28 Origin opener. More...

AFL player Toby Greene hit with TEN charges after allegedly assaulting pub staff during night out with friends in Melbourne . Mr Arroja, a Canterbury Bulldogs supporter, also slammed staff at the Beach Haus nightclub for letting Mitchell Pearce enter the establishment after he was removed from another hotel earlier in the evening. 'Why was he allowed to go into a club if he was already kicked out for being drunk,' he said. 'He'd been drinking at the Clovelly and got kicked out.' Mr Arroja said he was dubious that Pearce would be adequately punished for lunging at his daughter Melissa Arroja (pictured), shortly before it was revealed the footballer had been fined $20,000 .

Asked for his views on the now-infamous yellow dress which inspired a social media storm, Mr Arroja said: 'As far as I'm concerned it's a normal dress...she bought it from a shop.' The father-of-four said he was bombarded with phone calls and emails from family after bulletins revealed the identity of his daughter. MailOnline also asked for his opinion on Melissa Arroja's online 'Melzbubblebutt' alias. 'You'll have to talk to her,' he said. He also said he 'already hated the Roosters' prior to the booze-fueled incident early on Sunday morning.

He was arrested, led away in handcuffs and later issued with a $500 fine for failing to leave a licensed premises. Police announced on Tuesday morning they had wrapped up their inquiries after Ms Arroja declined to press charges. Summing up the Kings Cross incident, Mr Arroja said 'She's not a child. She's done nothing wrong...if she was in trouble with police then I'd be worried. 'I think (Pearce) learned a good lesson, and if not somebody's going to teach him.' Ms Arroja, of Portugese decent, removed her social media accounts from the internet on Tuesday afternoon after media outlets reported her name. She earlier boasted to followers that her slitted Fluro dress attracted footballers, writing on an Instagram picture of herself: 'That dress is shooo hot but attracts nothing but drama… And footy players farkkk,' according to the Daily Telegraph.

The Seafield Arms Hotel in Cullen, Moray, was originally put on the market for £900,000 when it went on the market in 2011. But after being reduced to £490,000 by Shepherd Chartered Surveyors last May, its guide price has been slashed once again to attract a buyer as it goes up for auction in London next week. Unattractive offer: The Seafield Arms Hotel has stood empty for the past three years . Prominent position: The 23-bedroom hotel attracted thousands of guests in its heyday . During its heyday the hotel attracted thousands of visitors to the Moray coast but after shutting up shop in 2011 it has failed to attract a buyer. Simon Bailey, a director and auctioneer at Eddisons, the firm holding the sale, said: ‘This is a well-known property in a prominent position which could be re-established as a fully trading hotel. ‘It also has potential for alternative uses, subject to planning.’ Originally built as a coaching house by the Earl of Seafield in 1822, the three-storey building was restored in 1972.

But after its closure local residents branded it an eyesore. Ron Shepherd from Moray Council said: ‘The Seafield Arms was a really nice and classy place, so I'm hoping that it remains a hotel. ‘But the main thing is that something is done with it - even if it's turned into flats. ‘At the moment it looks awful. It's in a really prominent position in the town and it's terrible to see it all boarded up.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Could radar be the answer to keeping an eye on elderly people without invading their privacy? That’s what a team of researchers at Villanova University in Pennsylvania are aiming to prove with their experiment. They say using radar could keep track of older relatives and even detect when they fall over. Scroll down for video . Researchers at Villanova University in Pennsylvania have developed a radar system that can detect when people move and fall. They say it could be used to keep track of elderly people and get them help if needed. Pictured is a graduate student taking part in the experiment . The system uses radar units small enough to fit in your hand. They send electromagnetic waves into the surrounding environment. As these waves bounce off people and objects they can monitor what is going on in the room. The system can tell the difference between some falling and just sitting down. If it detects a fall, it sends a signal to mobile phones or relevant people, such as relatives and emergency services. The technology is so accurate that apparently it can also monitor the heart rate and breathing of people in the room. And it can also pinpoint which part of the room events have happened in, so the response can be swift if needed. However, the system is specific to the user, so it is not quite ready to be rolled out en masse yet. The algorithms are trained to the motions of one user, but in future this could be generalised. Right now, according to the researchers, 40 million Americans are over the age of 65, and the Census Bureau predicts that by the year 2030, 80 million Americans will be 65 or older. Due to these rising statistics, families, communities and health care providers are at a cross-road in terms of how to best serve this growing aging population. Many elderly individuals choose to live alone, which poses a great risk as falls and other ailments become more likely as a person ages. In order to increase the safety and security of an elderly person living alone, researchers at Villanova University are examining the use of through-the-wall radar technology to detect falls and monitor the elderly in their individual living spaces. Graduate . students in the College of Engineering were trained in walking, falling, . and functioning like an elderly person and experiments were conducted . in the radar-imaging lab on Villanova’s campus. Kelly . Nestor, a clinical instructor in Villanova’s College of Nursing and an . expert in the growing elderly population, educated and trained the . students on how the elderly carry themselves and walk - with or without . the assistance of canes or walkers. The system works by bouncing radar off people and objects. It must be individually tailored to a specific user so it knows if, for example, they have a cane or other form of support. It is hoped the system can be generalised to various users in the future though . 40 million Americans are over the age of 65, and the Census Bureau predicts that by the year 2030, 80 million Americans will be 65 or older. Due to these rising statistics, families, communities and health care providers are at a cross-road in terms of how to best serve this growing aging population . Dr . Moeness Amin, director of the Center for Advanced Communications in the . College of Engineering, is the Principal Investigator for the project. His research focuses on various applications for radar imaging, including search and rescue, defence, and law enforcement. Dr . Amin and his team, through a grant from Qatar University, are now . developing a series of algorithms to identify the patterns and routines . of an elderly person in his or her home. The radar, with the help of these algorithms, can detect when a person is sitting, standing, walking and so on. They . say detection of motion, and even classification of what sort of motion . it is (such as walking or falling), can be achieved in all rooms inside . a home with just one or a few radar units. ‘Radar has become a mature technology,’ says Dr Amin in the video. ‘Radar is becoming faster, less expensive, more compact and more reliable. ‘So people have started thinking about transitioning this technology into healthcare. ‘In the elderly care the radar looks at the human as a target, so we would like to detect the fall and locate the fall. ‘We would like to do so with respect to privacy, and also try to focus on the fact that it should be non-intrusive.’","Scientists in the US have developed a system for monitoring elderly people .

"By . Mark Duell . An attempted grave robbing was today being investigated by police after thieves tried to access an elderly couple’s buried coffins. The culprits dug a large hole next to the final resting place of Henry and Betty Brazil at Tredworth Road Cemetery in Gloucester - in a crime that was a throwback to the days of Victorian England. Officers from Gloucestershire Constabulary said the suspects had tried to access their joint casket in a failed bid to get to the jewellery they were wearing when they were buried. Failed attempt: The grave belonging to Henry and Betty Brazil at a cemetery in Gloucester showing the hole next to it where robbers planned to gain access to the coffin . Resting place: Officers from Gloucestershire Constabulary said the suspects had tried to access their joint casket in a failed bid to get to the jewellery they were wearing when they were buried . The couple’s distraught family only discovered the attempted theft after visiting the cemetery to pay their respects, finding someone had dug a 4ft deep hole, 3ft wide and 3ft long, next to their graves. The offenders had even placed two recycling boxes upside down in the hole and laid earth across the top in an attempt to disguise their work. Nothing was stolen but the family believe the offenders were after jewellery and other valuables contained in the buried casket. Jenny Jones, Mr and Mrs Brazil’s daughter, said: ‘This is very upsetting. It’s like the dead can’t rest anymore. It’s not fair at all. All my brothers and sisters are distressed. Couple: Nothing was stolen but the family believe the offenders were after jewellery and other valuables contained in the buried casket, containing the bodies of Henry and Betty Brazil (pictured) Front and back: The grave in Gloucestershire has a message to Mr and Mrs Brazil from 'your boys and girls' ‘There’s someone at the grave pretty much every day at the moment to make sure this doesn’t happen again but we can’t keep that up forever. My message is, “Please, just let them rest”.’ 'This is very upsetting. It’s like the dead can’t rest anymore. It’s not fair at all.

She said: ‘When it happened I was in complete disbelief. We couldn’t believe what had happened - why would somebody do that to someone? ‘I just can’t understand why.

The answers to these questions lie hidden behind the six or seven-digit code at the end of your address. Forty years after every town and city in the UK was allocated its own postcode, a new study commissioned by Royal Mail, today gives a detailed insight into everyday life in communities across the country. The research examined five key areas - health and wellbeing, work, the cost of living, safety and security and home life. What does your postcode say about you? A new study by Royal Mail reveals a snapshot of daily life in communities across the UK . Healthiest postcodes in England:1. SW1X - Central London2. EC2V - Central London3. W8 - Central London4. SW7 - Central London5. EC1A - Central LondonHighest average age of population:1. IP15 - Suffolk Coastal2. LL73 - Anglesey3. PO34 - Isle of Wight4. BH13 - Poole5.

EX21 - Beaworthy, Devon5. EC2V - Central London . Does your postcode begin with IP15? If so then you will be a resident of the charming Suffolk coastal town of Aldeburgh. It is known for its music festivals, fish and chips and being the home of composer Sir Benjamin Britten. But what you might not know, is that it is the postcode with the oldest average population in Britain, with locals typically aged just over 55 years old. At the other end of the age spectrum, the university city of Birmingham harbours the postcode district with the youngest average age. The city's B4 postcode area, covering part of the city centre and Aston University, has an average age of 23. The study reveals London has the five healthiest areas in England - with the exclusive SW1X area of Knightsbridge taking top spot. Researchers looked at all aspects of health, from general health to death rates, hospital stays and A&E attendances. The postcode EC2V stretching from London's St Paul's cathedral to Bank is ranked the second healthiest spot with parts of Kensington, Chelsea and the Barbican completing the top five. Outside London, Hampshire has the two healthiest postcode areas - Fleet (GU52) and Hook (RG27). In Scotland, the top three healthiest postcode sectors are in Dumfries and Galloway. They are Langholm (DG13), Gretna (DG16) and Canonbie (DG14), followed by Edinburgh (EH9) and then the PA72 postcode sector representing Argyll and Bute. In Wales the healthiest spot is Cynderwen in Dyfed (SA66) and in Northern Ireland it is Hillsborough (BT26). Meanwhile those people living in Poole are more likely to be married than those living anywhere else in the UK. Of those with the BH18 postcode, around two-thirds are married. Canterbury . in Kent (CT1-CT6) has the lowest birth rate in Britain, with just under . 44 births for every 1,000 women aged between 16 and 44. The highest is in Barking (RM5-RM10), with 90 births for every 1,000 women in this age group. Those living in the Suffolk coastal town of Aldeburgh can expect to enjoy a long and happy life, with the postcode IP15 revealed as being home to those with the highest average age in the country . The exclusive address of Cadogan Square in London's Knightsbridge is the healthiest area of the UK, according to a new study commissioned by Royal Mail to mark the 40th anniversary of the towns and cities across the country being allocated postcodes . The postcode of B4 covering part of central Birmingham is the area in the UK with the lowest average age . The people of Worcester have the most cars, an average of 1.95 per household, according to the statistics from the Centre for Economic and Business Research. Those in the Isles of Scilly have the fewest, typically one car for every ten homes. The report reveals that outside London the biggest mortgage debt is in Surrey’s exclusive Virginia Water (GU25), typically at around £50,000 per person. The place with the highest mortgage debt is the City of London (EC4A). Mostly a business area, it includes some hugely expensive residential homes and has an average mortgage debt of £112,000 per person. Postcode sectors in the City of London, . Coldstream in Northumberland and the Isle of Islay, Scotland, have some . highest average personal loan values in the UK. Somerton and Frome in the West Country have the lowest unemployment rates in the UK, while Birmingham has the top ranked postcode sector outside London for highest qualified residents.Northumberland and West Cumbria have the lowest crime rates in England. In Scotland it is Shetland (ZE2), in Wales it is Clarbeston Road in Dyfed (SA63) and in Northern Ireland it is Craigavon (BT67). Postcodes were first tested in Norwich in 1959, but it was not until 1974 that all parts of the country had their own. Two-thirds of those people living in the BH18 postcode area of Poole in Dorset are married - the highest in England . The town of Coldstream on the Scottish borders, Northumberland has the lowest crime rate of any postcode across the UK . The Canterbury postcodes have the lowest birthrate of any in the country . In 1959 the first postcodes were trialled in Norwich. The need came as Royal Mail started a major mechanism programme designed to use machines to overcome the problems of labour intensive letter sorting. This depended on reducing the address to a machine-readable code. In 1966, the eight-year programme to postcode the whole country began. This was completed in 1974 with the recoding of Norwich. In 1959 the first postcodes were trialled in Norwich. in 1966 the eight-year programme to postcode the whole country began, and was completed with the recoding of Norwich in 1974 . There are around 1.8 million postcodes in use today across the UK. The use of the postcode has evolved over the years and has now become much more than a tool for driving Royal Mail delivery. The Postcode Address File (PAF), managed by Royal Mail’s Address Management Unit, contains details of all 29 million UK delivery points. It is used by tens of thousands of organisations and businesses every day to update databases, confirm identities, prevent fraud and support new satellite navigation and location solutions. In total, there are 48 million postcodes available under Royal Mail’s alpha-numeric systemThe combination of letters and numbers was chosen because people can remember a mixture of numbers and letters more easily than a list of numbers and it gives more code combinations. Optical recognition machines read the postcodes and automatically convert them to phosphor dots. These are in turn read by the sorting machines which handle correctly addressed mail, post-coded letters 20 times faster than manual sorting. On average one postcode covers 17 residential addresses. Royal Mail’s online Postcode Finder is one of the UK’s most used webpages with around 100,000 visits a day – more than 40 million a year.","Study commissioned by Royal Mail to mark 40th anniversary of postcodes .

"By . Hugo Gye . Theft: Barmaid Abby Brindle has admitted stealing £3,000 from the pub where she worked . A barmaid who was caught on camera stealing £3,000 from the till of the pub where she worked has been ordered to repay just £500 after saying she was sorry. Student nurse Abby Louise Brindle, 21, took cash from her employer and used it to pay off credit cards and buy cannabis and a new iPhone. However, after she told magistrates she was 'acutely remorseful' about the crime and expressed concern about her future career, they said she would have to repay only £5 a week. Richard Hilliard, manager of Tricky's bar in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, set up a CCTV camera disguised as a smoke alarm after noticing that money was going missing from the till. He saw Brindle stuffing banknotes into her handbag, and when he confronted her she admitted stealing the money to pay for credit card and loan bills. She also spent the cash on cannabis, an Xbox console, a new iPhone, hair extensions and bicycles which she gave to young relatives. 'Within 12 minutes of her shift starting, she went to the cash drawer, took the money out, and put it in her bag,' Mr Hilliard said. 'We then watched the rest of her shift, and she was just taking money out of the drawer over and over during the night and putting them in her purse. There were people at the bar while she was doing it. We were stunned.' Caught: A hidden CCTV camera filmed Brindle taking bundles of cash from the bar . Stash: She put the money in her handbag and later spent it on drugs and expensive gadgets . Brindle, . from Accrington, pleaded guilty to theft at Blackburn Magistrates' Court, but was told she only had to repay £500 at a rate of £5 a week, . to be deducted from her benefit payments. Mr Hilliard says he cannot reclaim the additional £2,500 from his insurer because the theft was an 'inside job'. 'There was once a time that any employee who stole from the boss was automatically sent to jail - and I expected her to get at least three months in prison because she had been stealing from me for some time,' the landlord said. 'But I was fuming when I heard what she got. Payback at £5 a week is a joke and just mere pocket money for what she did - and as a taxpayer I even have to pay it because it comes out of her benefits. Student: Brindle is currently studying as a nurse and worries she will not be able to get a job in future . Workplace: The manager of Tricky's bar in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire is £2,500 out of pocket . 'Abby was . like part of the family. We have known her for years and we were the . best of friends. I gave her a job and I trusted her completely. I let . her run the pub, and if she was stuck for money I would lend it to her. I . can't believe she has betrayed us like this. 'When . we went to court and heard the verdict I just sat there shocked and . appalled. I have never had money stolen from me before and never thought . it would be from one of my own. 'The irony is that you don't expect your staff, your family even, to steal from you. I will never get that money back.' Mr Hilliard added that he had never suspected that Brindle could be capable of the crime, due to the long-standing links between him and his employee. Sorry: Brindle was allowed to avoid paying back the majority of the money after she apologised in court . Benefits: Brindle, pictured on a night out with a friend, is living off benefits after taking a year off from university . Fury: The manager of the bar said that Brindle was like a member of the family . 'Abby is a really bubbly girl who lights up the room when she walks in,' he said. 'I honestly thought I had got a diamond when she started doing shifts with us. 'I have known her mother for a long time too. They are a lovely family and they were all in tears when they found out what she did. Her mother offered to pay me back - but it isn't her fault, why should she pay me back?' In court, defence lawyer Janet Syme claimed Brindle was 'acutely remorseful' to be appearing in court for the first time. She said Brindle was taking a year out from an adult nursing course at Edge Hill University in Ormskirk because of a spinal injury. Miss Syme added: 'She has ambitions to become a nurse and fears this conviction may be an obstacle to that. People who have known her for a long time were shocked to hear she had been involved in this offence. 'She has never been in trouble before and it is completely out of character for her.'","Abby Louise Brindle, 21, took cash from bar where she worked in Lancashire .

"By . Jill Reilly . Vinod Khosla, 59, a billionaire technology mogul who blocked access to a popular public beach . A billionaire technology mogul is at war with surfers after blocking access to a popular public beach. Vinod Khosla, 59, the co-founder of Sun Microsystems who now runs his own venture capitalist firm, appeared in a San Mateo County courtroom on Monday afternoon to testify in the civil dispute. Mr Khosla is accused of closing the only road that leads to Martin's Beach in violation of the California Coastal Act. The beach is about 35 miles south of San Francisco and is a favourite with surfers for its great waves. It was open to the public for years for $5 access and parking . In California, unlike in many other states, all beaches are open to the public under the constitution. But private landowners are not always required to allow access to the coastline across their properties. Many disputes have arisen over the years, often involving wealthy beachfront homeowners. In the case of Martin's Beach, the previous owner had allowed locals to access the beach for a fee. But Mr Khosla, a father of three, who owns the land via limited liability . corporations, has closed off the access road and hired guards to keep people . out. Scroll down for video . Mr Khosla, a father of three, who owns the land via limited liability corporations, has closed off the access road and hired guards to keep people out . In court this week he said he did not remember seeing certain documents, including one from a judge saying he would need approval to close off access to the beach. 'I get 500 to 1,000 pages of documents a week. I'm not trying to be unreasonable, that is what my life is like,' Mr Khosla testified, according to KTVU-TV. 'I was dumbfounded at the lack of . ability to explain or remember,' the plaintiff attorney Joe Cotchett . told KTVU outside the court. For the 100%, not just the 1%: Protesters in February hold up signs in support of beach access to Martin's Beach . Without the road access Martin's Beach (pictured) can only be reached from the ocean . Mr Khosla bought the 89-acre Martins Beach property for $37.5 million in 2008, reports SiliconValley.com. Two years later he closed the gate on a private road off Highway 1 leading to it - a move that incensed the Surfrider Foundation and environmentalists . Mr Khosla's attorney, Jeffrey Essner, says the public was previously allowed to access the beach for a fee, so there was never a right of public access. According to the Surfrider Foundation because the gates were permanently locked, the usage of the land has changed - they argue that qualifies as development under state coastal law and therefore required a permit from the California Coastal Commission. But Mr Khosla, who has been an early backer of environmentally friendly startups, says he does not need a development permit as his lawyers argue there has been no development. But his attorneys claim he simply wants to establish that he cannot be forced to allow people on the property and he had no specific plans for the property. Mr Khosla said that his attorneys have pursued the issue in court because he wants 'facts of law' to determine what is right, rather than 'public opinion.' Video courtesy Surfrider Foundation . Mr Khosla, 59, the co-founder of Sun Microsystems who now runs his own venture capitalist firm, appeared in a San Mateo County courtroom Monday afternoon to testify in the civil dispute . The dispute echoes record mogul David Geffen's long battle to prevent use of a walkway near his Malibu home. In 1983, Geffen agreed to allow a pathway to Carbon Beach when he sought permits for a pool and other additions, but he later filed suit to fight the access. In 2005, Geffen settled the suit and allowed the public walkway. Dubbed 'Billionaire's Beach,' Carbon has been home to titans such as Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison and movie and television stars John Travolta, Courtney Cox and David Arquette. The tiff also evokes some other neighborly disputes in recent years involving wealthy technology executives including late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and Ellison. Jobs fought a bitter battle with neighbors in Woodside, California, over a 1920s-era house he owned but wanted to tear down and replace with something sleeker. He twice won demolition permits that were contested by preservationists; the wrecking ball finally came down in 2011, months before his death. The property is now vacant. That same year, Ellison settled a case he had filed against his neighbors over trees he said blocked views of the bay from his house in San Francisco's Pacific Heights neighborhood. In 2012, special-effects pioneer George Lucas, the creator of Star Wars, got so fed up with his development-fighting neighbors in Marin County, California, that he scrapped plans to expand his Skywalker Ranch and said he would instead sell it to a developer to build low-income housing.","Vinod Khosla, 59, is the co-founder of Sun Microsystems .

"By . Joshua Gardner . and Associated Press . Still smiling? An upstate New York school board president will soon be asked to step down after he was caught calling a parent 'chubby wubby' on an open mic last night during a board meeting . Parents of school children in a tiny New York State town are calling for the resignation of a school board president after he described one parent as a fat 'chubby wubby' on an open mike. The remark by Ray Cote, who's led the board since 2011, was made during a Mahopac school board meeting last month. It was videotaped and broadcast on a local cable access station and live-streamed via the Internet. Now parents plan to call for Cote's resignation at a board meeting Tuesday night, whether he apologizes or not.

"By . Snejana Farberov . The wire: Karen Dziewit, 24, was charged with unlawful wiretapping after secretly recording her arrest for disorderly conduct . A 24-year-old Massachusetts woman was charged with unlawful wiretapping after secretly recording her arrest for disorderly conduct. The Springfield Police Department accused Karen Dziewit of drinking outside a building at about 2am Sunday. She’s also accused of yelling and disturbing residents and refusing to quiet down. When the 24-year-old Dziewit was about to be taken into custody, police say she turned on a recording feature on her smartphone, hid it in her purse and captured her arrest. Ms Dziewit was charged with unlawful wiretapping, disorderly conduct and an open container violation. On Monday, the Chicopee resident was arraigned and released on her own recognizance. She is due back in court July 8 for a pre-trial hearing. Under a Massachusetts state law, it is illegal to record someone's voice without the person's knowledge or permission. Chapter 272, Section 99 of the General Laws states that it is against the law 'to secretly hear, secretly record, or aid another to secretly hear or secretly record the contents of any wire or oral communication through the use of any intercepting device by any person other than a person given prior authority by all parties to such communication.' The incident that landed Karen Dziewit behind bars took place at around 2am Sunday outside of 140 Chestnut Street in Chicopee. According to the arrest report obtained by The Springfield Republican, police officers Jameson Williams and Clay Canning were called to the scene after receiving reports of a verbal spat in the street involving a woman and two men. Rabble-rouser: Police say the 24-year-old woman, who claimed to be a law student, told them she has been secretly recording her arrest with her smartphone concealed in her purse . The responding officers identified Dziewit as the 'aggressor' in the fight and observed in their report that she had a 'strong odor of alcohol emanating from her person.' The 24-year-old woman was described as being very irate, and her demeanor grew more belligerent as the officers tried to calm her down. One of her companions explained to police that the trio were driving home from a bar in West Springfield when Dziewit became upset over an argument they had earlier in the evening. The report states that when Dziewit and her two friends got out of the car on Chestnut Street, the woman slapped one of the men in the face. Belligerent: Dziewit got into a fight with two male friends on her way home from a bar, and she refused to stop yelling even after two responding officers and passersby pleaded with her to calm down . After the two officers responded to the scene of the altercation, they said Dziewit continued shouting obscenities at her two male companions, and screamed at the cops that they didn’t know how to do their jobs. According to the arrest report, the woman then demanded Canning and Williams' badge numbers claiming that she was in 'law school,' and that she was going to get the two of them 'fired.' The Chicopee resident continued yelling even after two passersby pleaded with her to settle down, police said. As the woman refused to stop screaming, Canning and Williams decided to arrest her for disorderly conduct. That is when the 24-year-old cried out: 'I've been recording this the whole time, my phone is in my purse, see in court.' When the officers searched Dziewit's bag, they reportedly found her cell phone with the voice recorder switched on, as well as an empty half-pint of Five O’clock Vodka. Massachusetts is one of a dozen 'two-party consent' states where it is prohibited by law to secretly record a conversation with someone. However, in 2011, an appeals court citing First and Fourth Amendment rights ruled in favor of a Boston attorney who was arrested for videotaping police activity in public.","Springfield, Massachusetts, police officers say Karen Dziewit threatened to get them fired during her arrest on disorderly conduct charge .

"By . Louise Boyle . A female prison guard has claimed that she was sexually assaulted by 17 inmates - and that it took her bosses more than two months to call the police. The woman, who has not been identified, was on duty in December at a Miami-Dade correctional facility in south Florida when she was cornered by a gang of men while responding to an out-of-control murder suspect. While she was dealing with the prisoner, other inmates flooded into the enclosed area  after a cell door that should have been closed was left open. Scroll down for video . In the prison surveillance footage, a riot breaks out among inmates at the Florida jail leaving corrections officers struggling to regain control. It was during this time that one female officer claims to have been sexually assaulted . The open house prison in south Florida erupted into violence on December 30 - but a female officer who was allegedly assaulted said that her attack was not reported to police . The prison door on the upper left of the surveillance tape screen was left open by mistake which allowed men to pass into another area where one female guard was trying to restrain a prisoner . She told NBC 6: 'I was devastated. I was traumatized. I was physically and sexually assaulted.' In a horrifying video, prison guards can be seen struggling to get control of dozens of inmates in the open housing bay. Three other guards were also hurt in the December 30 incident. Shortly before the situation gets out-of-control, the surveillance footage shows show several inmates slipping through an open cell door. Off-camera, the female guard said she was on the other side of that open door, trying to get control of Derrick Harrell, 23, who was awaiting trial for murder. In a later report, the female officer told her supervisors: 'I was pushed, punched... in my head, . face, neck... abdomen and back; the inmates began to grab my vaginal . area, breast, and buttocks. 'I was kicked in . the vaginal area and groped by several inmates. While I was being . sexually assaulted... I thought I was about to be gang raped.' The woman, who has not been identified, said that the sexual assault had left her 'traumatized' The diagram reveals how two gates left open my mistake led to the female prison guard being cornered by a gang of male prisoners .

She . spent 60 days off work while recovering from the assault and when she . returned, the woman was shocked to find that no one had taken the . incident to police. She threatened to call police herself if no one took action. On March 15, police were notified - 73 days after the attack took place. Harrell was arrested the next day for battery on a law enforcement officer. He has pleaded not guilty. MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the corrections department's interim director Marydell Guevara.

"By . Dan Bloom . Police must do more to report and track hate crimes so people can 'fully understand what is happening in our communities, and how to stop it,' the director of the FBI has said. James Comey said some areas still fail to report hate crimes on their watch, while others say none occurred - 'a fact that would be welcome if true'. Mr Comey spoke out less than two weeks after a white supremacist disowned as a 'loose cannon' by former Ku Klux Klan members was charged with shooting three people dead in Kansas, Texas. Anger: FBI director James Comey said hate crimes 'strike at the heart of one's identity' and must be stopped . Accused: Frazier Glenn Cross in a court appearance last week. The 73-year-old white supremacist is accused of shooting dead three people including a 14-year-old boy at a Jewish community center in Kansas, Texas . Frazier Glenn Cross shouted 'Heil Hitler' to television cameras as he was arrested for the murders at a Jewish community center and a nearby Jewish retirement home. Dr William Corporon, 69, was shot dead alongside his grandson Reat Underwood, 14. Also killed was 53-year-old Terri LaManno, who was visiting her mother at the retirement complex. Investigators said Cross was 'trying to hurt someone based on race or ethnicity' in what has been interpreted as an anti-Semitic attack. But it transpired that all three victims were Christians. Speaking to a summit of the Anti-Defamation League yesterday, Mr Comey said 73-year-old Cross was a 'madman with a warped view of what America should look like'. Last week it emerged Cross, who rose through the ranks of several white supremacist organizations, once entered the witness protection program for soliciting a black male prostitute who was dressed as a woman. Accused: Cross previously appeared before a court dishevelled and in a sleeveless smock . Victims: Dr William Corporon, 69, his grandson Reat Underwood, 14, and 53-year-old Terri LaManno . Hate crimes are distinct from other crimes, Mr Comey said, because 'they strike at the heart of one's identity.' He . said: 'We must continue to impress upon our state and local . counterparts in every jurisdiction the need to track and report hate . crime.  It is not something we can ignore or sweep under the rug.' The FBI publishes hate crime statistics, described as offenses motivated by a bias against a race, religion, sexual orientation or other traits, from local law enforcement data. But those reports are generally incomplete because not all jurisdictions contribute information, Mr Comey said. Warnings had already been raised about Cross, who went by the name Glenn Miller and wrote to white supremacist Kevin Harpham after he was sentenced to 32 years for planting a bomb at a Martin Luther King Day parade in Spokane, Washington, in 2011. In August, he was mentioned as an example of dangerous anti-Semitic figures in a presentation to the Jewish community center by the Institute for Research & Education on Human Rights. It wasn't clear what, if any, steps were taken by the center to act on the information.

Warnings: Glenn Miller, aka Frazier Glenn Cross, pictured in 1985 as the leader of the White Patriot Party at a training camp in North Carolina (left) and in 1984 after founding the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (right) The Anti-Defamation League also noted a sharp drop in anti-Semitic attacks less than two weeks before the shooting. In a report on April 1, the civil rights organisation noted a 19 per cent drop in 2013 compared to 2012, part of what the group called a 'decade-long downward slide' and one of its lowest tallies since it started keeping such records in 1979. Mr Comey told the annual summit in Washington that homegrown violent extremists pose a continuing threat, while the overseas threat from terrorism has continued to evolve along with new tactics and methods of communication. Though al-Qaeda is less dominant than it used to be, its affiliates remain a 'top threat,' he said. He added the FBI remained concerned about American citizens who are radicalized by fighting in countries like Syria.","Frazier Glenn Cross accused of killing three people in Kansas, Texas .

"By . Leon Watson . Norman Foster has expressed his 'sadness' after his firm's controversial $350 million revamp of the New York Public Library was scrapped. The celebrated architect's company . Foster + Partners had been enlisted to redesign the Library's . century-old Beaux-Arts research building on Manhatten's Fifth Avenue. The plan had drawn widespread opposition from scholars and was the target of four lawsuits. One critic labelled the Foster design as having 'all the elegance and distinction of a suburban mall'. The New York Public Library has abandoned its $300 million plan to revamp its flagship midtown Manhattan building and move 1.5 million books to New Jersey . New York's new mayor Bill de Blasio also campaigned against the renovations during last year's municipal elections. And only last week hundreds of protesters gathered outside . the building during a meeting of trustees. But the most obvious reason . for the U-turn is the project's increasing price tag. Foster + Partners declined to . comment, but Lord Foster told The New York Times: 'Obviously, I respect . the decision of the trustees and whoever's been involved in the . decision. 'If I have any . kind of sadness on the thing – besides obviously not having the project . going ahead and having spent a huge amount of passion on the project . with colleagues – it is that the proposals have never been revealed, and . there hasn't really been a debate by those involved, including those . who would have benefited from an inclusive approach to the library.' British architect Norman Foster has expressed his 'sadness' that his firm's plan to revamp the New York Public Library has been scrapped . The renovation would have involved moving 1.5 million books from stacks in the Fifth Avenue building to storage in New Jersey . New York's new mayor Bill de Blasio also campaigned against the renovations during last year's municipal elections . The plan involved closing and selling two midtown branch libraries. Their functions would have been consolidated inside the main research library at 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue, which would have become a circulating library. The New York Times, which first reported the library's about-face, said probable cost overruns were one factor in the decision. It said a study showed the project's cost would have been significantly more than the $300 million originally budgeted. The renovation would have involved moving 1.5 million books from stacks in the Fifth Avenue building to storage in New Jersey. Scholars complained that moving so many books would have created hardships for researchers. The revised plan still will involve renovating the research library, formally known as the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, while keeping the stacks intact. The renovation was to have been partly financed with $150 million from the city budget. That money still will go to the library but now will be used for other purposes.","Foster + Partners enlisted to redesign Library's research building .

"By . Julian Robinson . V. Stiviano’s part in the firestorm over Donald Sterling has taken a fresh turn – after she reportedly crashed the Ferrari he gave her. Miss Stiviano sparked controversy after an audio recording was leaked of the 81-year-old LA Clippers owner launching a racist rant in which he berated his girlfriend for being seen in public with black friends, including Magic Johnson. Now it has emerged that the 31-year-old has been involved in a road crash, having rolled the Ferrari Mr Sterling is said to have given her as a gift into the back of another car. V. Stiviano, pictured right at the wheel of her Ferrari and wearing her customary visor . Pictured on a separate occasion with her visor down, V. Stiviano steps out of the red Ferrari given to her by LA Clippers owner Donald Stirling. Reports suggest she crashed the vehicle into the back of a Range Rover . TMZ reports that she was driving the luxury red car behind a Range Rover when she is believed to have failed to stop and rear ended the vehicle in Beverley Hills. The Range Rover driver has told the website that she was wearing her distinctive visor at the time of the crash. The report says Miss Stiviano then jumped out of her Ferrari before ‘screaming every obscenity in the book’ telling the driver: ‘You know who you’re messing with, mother f*****?’ When it came to exchanging insurance details by the side of the road, she reportedly refused and asked ‘an assistant’ to do it instead.

Stiviano, pictured climbing out of her Ferrari on a separate occasion, reportedly refused and asked ¿an assistant¿ to do it instead . V. Stiviano drives her Ferrari without her face visor. The driver of the black Range Rover she crashed into has reported how she screamed 'every obscenity in the book' after the incident . Miss Stiviano is then said to have claimed she had to return the vehicle, though she did not expand on the comment. The incident came just days after the former Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda said of V Stiviano: 'I don't wish that girl any bad luck, but I hope she gets hit with a car.' He made the remark after being asked about the race row involving Mr Sterling, his friend of 30 years. A lawsuit filed by Mr Sterling’s estranged wife of 50 years, Rochelle, claimed to show how the Clipper’s owner treated his girlfriend by lavishing her with a series of gifts including the Ferrari, two Bentleys, a Range Rover and a $1.4 million apartment. Mr Sterling was banned from the NBA after tapes surfaced of him telling Miss Stiviano not to bring black people to his games or pose with them in photos on Instagram. She had posed in the picture with basketball great Magic Johnson several weeks ago. Apologising: Mr Sterling, pictured at a Clippers game last October, has revealed he is sorry for the racist comments he made in recorded conversations with girlfriend V. Stiviano . At the center of the controversy: V. Stiviano (right) posted a picture of her and Magic Johnson on her Instagram, causing Sterling to get mad at her and telling her not to pose for pictures with black people . Miss Stiviano, who has described herself as being his 'confidante and friend', has denied releasing the tapes. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has since banned Mr Sterling for life and fined him $2.5 million. During a television interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Mr Sterling started by apologising for his racist comments. But as the interview progressed he blamed the media for blowing his words out of proportion before going on an angry attack against Magic Johnson, one of the targets of his racist remarks. Barbara Walters interviewed V. Stiviano, pictured, about Donald Sterling's alleged racist comments . Sterling first said the former basketball star was a ‘good person’ but his tone quickly changed and he made a series of disparaging remarks about Johnson's HIV-positive status, dismissing his work in charity and business and saying he's not a proper role model for children. He then said he believed his estranged girlfriend duped him by recording their private conversations.‘She would always use the word “black,”’ Mr. Sterling said of Stiviano. ‘That's a black girl, that's a black guy, this is black, that's black. So when she said to me I'm going to bring “four gorgeous black guys to the game,” players she was referring to either football or basketball, I was a little jealous maybe.’ The NBA swiftly punished Sterling following the release of the first recordings, banning him from the league for life and hitting him with a $2.5million fine. They may also force him to sell the team, and the NBA's Advisory/Fianance committee met by conference call last Wednesday to discuss the possible termination. Donald Sterling, pictured with his wife Rochelle Stein at a Los Angeles Police Awards Dinner in August 2011 . The committee released a statement saying they will meet again next week to discuss the matter further. Three-quarters of the NBA team owners would have to vote in agreement in order to force Sterling to sell. Former Time Warner Cable head and Obama advisor Dick Parsons has been chosen as the team's interim CEO for the transition period. Meanwhile, Sterling's estranged wife Shelly hopes to hold on to her 50 per cent stake in the Los Angeles team.","V. Stiviano crashes the Ferrari LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling gave her .

"By . Martin Robinson . Evidence: Andy Coulson admitted today he listened to David Blunkett's hacked voicemails but 'didn't know it was illegal' Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson today admitted he listened to hacked voicemails left by MP David Blunkett  where he told his married lover she was 'breaking his heart'. In the messages the former Home Secretary was said to . have repeatedly declared his love for Kimberley Fortier, as she tried to . break off their affair in July 2004. Coulson . told the Old Bailey hacking trial today he was played extracts of the . messages in his office but 'at that stage, I didn't know it was . illegal'. In some, Mr Blunkett asked her not to end their . relationship, which is thought to have begun in 2001. In . one recording the Labour politician says: ‘You are breaking my heart.’ In others, he tells her that he ‘yearns’ and ‘longs’ for . her. The Old Bailey heard previously police investigating phone hacking at the tabloid discovered 330 messages from Mr Blunkett and associates hidden in a News of the World safe. Coulson . said today he was 'shocked' when his chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck . first told him about the hacked messages, while he was on holiday in . Italy. 'Neville told me he . had a tip that David Blunkett was having an affair with Kimberly . Fortier. He said that he believed the story was true because he heard . some voicemails. 'I was . shocked because he told me he had heard some voicemail messages. I was . shocked that he was telling me this as well because it was in relation . to David Blunkett, the Home Secretary. 'I was quite angry about it. I used . reasonably colourful language, words to the effect ""What in earth do you . think you're doing"".' Scroll down for video . Ex-editor: Andy Coulson told the court that the News of the World was a competitive environment and that he had become 'paranoid' about leaks of stories to rivals. 'He believed it was in the public interest and he wanted to play me some voicemails to establish that to effectively demonstrate that', he said. 'I remember a few things, I remember a message where David Blunkett was effectively declaring his love and also saying he had considered taking the relationship public. 'I remember a phrase along the lines of 'I'm going to blow this apart', a mention of a terrorism arrest, and also I have in my mind a reference made to GCHQ. 'Neville believed the relationship had been going on for three years', said Coulson. 'And . he also made mentioned of the possibility that there might be an issue . of the paternity of one of Kimberly Fortier's children'. Coulson said the more he listened, the more he started to think there was 'some public interest justification' in the story but he wanted time to think about it. Asked where he thought the reporter had got the vociemail by his lawyer Timothy Langdale QC, Coulson said: 'The conversation did not go into detail about that. If I made an assumption, it was Neville had done this himself. It was all coming from Neville.' He added: 'I remained shocked - this was the first and only time a voicemail had been played to me.' Later, . Coulson said he started to justify pursuing the story on the basis that . Mr Blunkett was 'distracted' by the affair and he was sharing sensitive . information. He said he . took legal advice about the privacy aspect of the story. He concluded . the story still needed to be stood up but decided that Mr Blunkett was . more likely to do so if the NotW did not name his lover. Heartbreak: In the messages, Mr Blunkett was . said to have repeatedly declared his love for Ms Fortier as she tried to end their affair . He said: 'I thought, rightly or . wrongly, if I suggested to David Blunkett that I would not name Kimberly . Fortier, he would be more likely to confirm the story.' Coulson told the court that, looking back, he 'should not have handled the story the way I did'. Coulson authorised his staff to check . if Mr Blunkett met his lover when they suspected he would, as he still . felt the story needed 'standing up'. He . eventually resolved to speak to Mr Blunkett himself to confirm the . affair, and ran the story without her name because he was concerned . about breaching her privacy. He confronted Mr Blunkett about . the fling before the story was printed. In a tape of a meeting played to . the jury, Coulson said: ‘People know about this affair. I’m not saying . it’s an open secret, but people are aware of it.’ Paranoia over leaks rather than phone hacking at the News of the World prompted Andy Coulson to send an email ordering 'Do his phone', jurors have heard. The former editor denied the instruction to a colleague had anything to do with hacking the voicemails of celebrity Calum Best, son of footballer George Best. Coulson said an atmosphere of suspicion around a member of NotW staff led to the decision to inspect his phone billing data. He told the Old Bailey: 'I was quite resistant to the idea of anybody working for me leaking stories but there was a growing body of evidence that was being put forward by some other people on the paper and in the end - reluctantly - I approved the request for billing data in relation to (the member of staff).' He told jurors he was in no doubt that the email he sent was not an 'instruction to anybody to hack anybody's phone'. The risk of stories being published elsewhere was greater on a Sunday newspaper than a daily and that led to 'paranoia' over leaks. But he said: 'It was very destructive. It was all too much time and too much effort.' In the event, there was no evidence to support the suspicions surrounding the reporter in question, the court heard. Mr Blunkett refused to . confirm or deny it as his private life was ‘not fair game’. Coulson . said today he regretted not telling Mr Blunkett the affair story had . come from phone hacking because that would be brought it 'to a head'. 'At this distance, I shouldn't have handled the story in this way', he said. 'I should have stuck to my first instinct. 'It would have become apparent very quickly what I was laying out was the product of an illegal act.' In the confrontation with Mr Blunkett, Coulson repeatedly refused to reveal how he knows about the affair. Coulson told the court today: 'At least I would be able to argue my case. 'At that stage, I didn't know it was illegal and I felt it was possibly justified. 'It could have ended in legal action, it could have ended in police action. 'I sincerely wish I had followed that course of action at that point.' On his regret over the Blunkett story, Coulson said: 'It is easy to say now that what we were laying out in front of him was the product of an illegal act. 'My view is that I kind of wish I had. It would have brought the whole thing to a head and I would have at least been able to argue my point. 'I did not know it was illegal. How it would have ended I have no idea. It could have ended in legal action. It could have ended in police action. I sincerely wish I had followed that course of action at that moment. Coulson . quit as editor of the News of the World in January 2007 after the . convictions of Royal editor Clive Goodman and private detective Glenn . Mulcaire for phone hacking. Six . months later, he was appointed director of communications and planning . for the Conservative Party, retaining the post when David Cameron became . Prime Minister.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A fox in a field of newborn lambs would be enough to worry any ewe. But apparently not this one, who was pictured standing calmly beside the intruder as it watched lambs in the Scottish Borders. In one shot a young lamb just a few weeks old is in the foreground in full view of the fox. Best buddies: It looks almost as if the mother sheep is gunning for the fox, but she did nothing of the sort, and let the predator be . Adult mother sheep can be protective of their young and shepherds have told of seeing them lower their heads to butt a fox or usher it away from their new born. But in this instance the adult sheep are totally unconcerned by the proximity of the fox and, to be fair, the fox doesn’t seem much bothered either. The pictures were taken by Mal Young, 69, at a field near the village of Newstead, near Melrose, in the Scottish Borders recently. Mr Young had been walking his Labrador dog along a lane next to the field when he spotted the fox. He said: ‘It was a very strange sight. I saw the fox in the field and the sheep and lambs were not taking a blind bit of notice of it. Just the three of us: The ewe, the fox and the newborn lamb all appeared to be happily 'grazing' on the field . Having a field day: The new friends were pictured near the village of Newstead, near Melrose, in the Scottish Borders . ‘I have lived in the countryside for a long time and never seen anything like it. 'If there is a dog about the sheep normally go mad so I couldn’t understand why they would just be ignoring a natural predator like a fox, particularly as there were very young lambs in the field. ‘I watched the fox for a good five minutes hiding behind a gate so it couldn’t see me and managed to take some pictures. ‘The fox eventually ran off when two ladies came along the lane and I think it either saw them or picked up a scent.’ Mr Young said the fox appeared to be eating grass, like the sheep, although foxes eat a lot of worms as well so it may have been foraging.

Sentenced: John Yelcick, pictured, pleaded guilty to the abuse of a corpse and evidence tampering when he moved the body of his lover David Sellers . He told investigators the two had had sex and he woke up to find Sellers dead.

By filing an official missing person's report, the FBI and police will be able to join the search for Kasem, who is 82, has advanced Parkinson's, and struggles to speak. Scroll down for video . Search: Radio host Casey Kasem has been officially listed as a missing person a week after the 82-year-old was removed from his Santa Monica care home . Worried: Kerri Kasem has been made a temporary caretaker for her father and a judge demanded an investigation into his disappearance . A judge has made Miss Kasem a temporary caretaker for her father, and the courts have ordered an investigation into his whereabouts as his adult children say they fear for his well being. Concerns: A judge has ordered an investigation into the care and whereabouts of Casey Kasem . 'We don't know where he is. Nobody knows,' Danny Deraney, a representative for Miss Kasem, told People. The radio show host's middle daughter said that she and her sister Julie had visited their father last week, just days before he was secretly moved from his Santa Monica nursing home. Miss Kasem claims that her estranged stepmom, Jean Kasem is . responsible for the disappearance, and that the woman moved him in the . middle of the night without a court order or doctor's discharge. On Tuesday, a court granted Miss Kasem conservatorship of her father's health. 'I will do whatever I need to do to get my dad back!' Kerri, 35, told Closer. 'I'm praying that he is somewhere safe. I'm praying to God that he’s . being cared for and that he's not getting sicker and sicker by the day.'

Attorney Martha Patterson, an attorney for Ms Kasem, has claimed that Jean Kasem has no authority  to act as a healthcare agent or to move her husband without permission from a doctor. 'I cannot imagine someone in his condition being carried out without proper medical equipment,' she said. Miss Kasem added that she was 'filled with an extreme amount of worry' about her father. The daughter's words come after a . judge ordered an investigation into the whereabouts of the comedian . after an attorney for the ailing man's wife said he had been removed . from the country. Los . Angeles Superior Court Judge Daniel Murphy ordered a court investigator . and adult protective services to find out where Mr Kasem is being . treated and report back to the court. The elderly radio personality has been in various medical facilities chosen by his wife. His . children had earlier complained they had been unable to see their . father in accordance with an agreement with their stepmother. Legend: Casey Kasem, 82, suffers from advanced Parkinson's disease and has been in various medical facilities chosen by his wife, Jean Kasem . Ties: Radio Personality Casey Kasem, is seen with wife Jean Kasem, daughter Kerri Kasem, son Michael Kasem and daughter Julie Kasem on January 25, 1985. The children are from another marriage . Miss Kasem's attorney, Troy Martin, said the family believes the entertainer has been taken to a Native American reservation in Washington state. Judge Murphy's order came after Craig Marcus, an attorney who appeared on Jean Kasem's behalf at Monday's hearing, said he did not know where the radio personality was but knew that he had been removed from the country. 'I have no idea where he is,'Mr Marcus said. The . revelation brought stunned protests from Judge Murphy and two of Mr Kasem's daughters from a . previous marriage. 'Your statements concern me even more,' the judge told Mr Marcus, who declined to comment after the hearing. Mr Marcus said in court that Jean Kasem had every right to move her husband as she saw fit. Judge . Murphy appointed a doctor to look into Mr Kasem's care and ordered a . court-appointed attorney to find out his whereabouts as soon as . possible. Mr Kasem . gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, American Top 40 and . Casey's Top 40, and was the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon Scooby Doo.

Miss Kasem's case is the second one opened by one of the former host's children to try to gain access to their father and have some oversight over his care. A previous case by her sister, Julie, was dismissed after she reached a settlement with her stepmother, but the daughter said on Monday that agreement has been breached. In a court filing last week, Kerri Kasem's attorneys wrote that the entertainer has been repeatedly moved without warning and his children have been unable to see him. The complaint accused Jean Kasem of elder abuse by isolating her husband from his family. 'We've been troubled for a long time,' Miss Kasem said after Monday's court hearing. She said Judge Murphy's orders will ensure that the truth about her father's care comes out.

"By . Guy Walters . Clayton Derrell Lockett: Took 43 minutes to die when he was executed last week . Last Tuesday evening, a 38-year-old man called Clayton Derrell Lockett was led into the execution chamber at Oklahoma state penitentiary. The sentence he was due to receive had been handed down 14 years ago, for the horrific crime of torturing, shooting and burying alive teenager Stephanie Neiman. Unsurprisingly, on the day of his death, Lockett spent his last hours being extremely unco-operative with those who were to kill him. That morning, he had refused to be taken for an X-ray, and his guards were forced to stun him with a Taser. When he finally reached the medical centre, it was found that Lockett had earlier cut his own arm — perhaps as a way of trying to cheat his executioners by taking his own life. Despite the condemned man’s truculence, the grim routine of an execution continued unchecked. During the afternoon, Lockett was asked what he wanted for his final meal. He requested a chateau- briand steak, but it was turned down because it exceeded the $15 budget for last meals. He was offered a steak from a local fast-food joint, but declined. In the chamber, Lockett was asked if he had final words, to which he answered simply: ‘No.’ At 6.23pm, he was strapped down, covered in a white sheet, and then the process of killing him began. In Oklahoma, executions are carried out by a series of injections, which is considered the most ‘humane’ method. Under normal circumstances, a combination of three drugs is used. First, the prisoner is given an anaesthetic or powerful sedative. Second, another drug paralyses the body, which is swiftly followed by a third, which stops the heart. This method has been used many times, and it has been shown to be grimly effective, and — reportedly in most cases — painless. However, last Tuesday, the execution would be a little different. Instead of using a traditional drug to sedate Lockett, it was announced that a substitute would be used. As any medic will tell you, it is hard to predict how the body will react to certain combinations of drugs. As a result, the prison authorities were a little apprehensive, since this new ‘protocol’ for executing a prisoner had never been tried. Observers were warned that the process might take a little longer than usual. That was an understatement. At 6.33, ten minutes after he was first injected, Lockett was declared to be unconscious. However, three minutes later, the condemned man started to struggle violently, thrashing around and writhing against his restraints. He was even heard to say the word: ‘Man.’ Alarmed, the prison authorities drew the blinds so that the observers could not see what was quickly becoming all too apparent — the execution was being botched, and Lockett was in agony. In the end, it took Lockett 43 minutes to die. Death, it was announced, was finally brought about by a ‘massive heart attack’. Scroll down for video . A gurney used for executions in Texas.

Robert Patton, the director of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, later revealed what had gone wrong. ‘We’ve had a vein failure in which the chemicals did not make it into the offender,’ he said. ‘His vein exploded.’ Although the precise details are still not clear, it appears that the authorities had to administer the sedative via a catheter into Lockett’s groin, after which they were finally able to inject him with the second and third drugs. Mary Fallin, Oklahoma’s Governor, immediately ordered a halt to 54 planned executions, and demanded ‘an independent review’ into how the state executes those on Death Row. Around the world, opinion was divided, as it always is with the death penalty. ‘Why should we give him a humane death when he didn’t give his victim a humane death?’ asked one Oklahoma defence lawyer. ‘I think that’s a basic instinct.’ On the other side of the debate was the United Nations. A spokesman for the High Commissioner for Human Rights declared that the execution  process may have amounted to ‘cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment’ under international human rights law. Also adding their voice to those who condemned the execution was a London-based organisation called Reprieve UK, which campaigns worldwide for the abolition of capital punishment. ‘States need to stop conducting secretive, experimental executions,’ said Maya Foa, head of Reprieve’s Death Penalty team. Ms Foa, a 30-year-old former teacher, then launched an attack on companies that supplied the drugs used for executions. ‘It is a clear demonstration of why no responsible pharmaceutical firm or pharmacy wants to get involved in selling drugs to executioners,’ she said. ‘How many more of these horrifying events will it take before the authorities in Oklahoma and elsewhere get the message?’ However, what Ms Foa — unsurprisingly — failed to mention was that Lockett’s execution might never have been botched had it not been for Reprieve. Mary Fallin Govenor of Oklahoma ordered to halt the executions - demanding an independent review . For the past four years, Reprieve has been vigorously lobbying governments and pharmaceutical companies to stop supplying the U.S. Department of Corrections with drugs for executions. The campaign has been so successful that it has brought near chaos to the U.S. justice system, as it has been denied supplies of the tried and tested drugs. As a direct consequence, the authorities have had to test new ‘protocols’ on their condemned prisoners — some of which have produced agonising and unnecessarily drawn-out deaths. The botched execution of Clayton Lockett follows a similarly mishandled execution in January in Ohio, when it took a 53-year-old rapist and murderer called Dennis McGuire nearly half an hour to die, during which time he was clearly contorted in agony. Had the authorities had access to their normal drugs, it is likely McGuire’s execution would have passed in much the same way as that of the 52 other Ohio prisoners killed by lethal injections. In fact, of the 1,300 prisoners the U.S. has executed since it restored the death penalty in the Seventies, nearly 1,200 have been killed by lethal injection. Reprieve’s campaign, Stop the Lethal Injection Project (SLIP) started in 2010. In October of that year, the organisation discovered that a British firm, Archimedes Pharma UK, had made — but not knowingly supplied — the drug that was used in the execution in Arizona of a murderer called Jeffrey Landrigan. Reprieve lobbied the Business Secretary, Vince Cable, to impose  an export ban on the chemical. At first, Cable did not agree, but then, at the end of November 2010, the Business Secretary acquiesced. The director of Reprieve, Clive Stafford Smith, a high-profile British lawyer who has contested numerous death penalty cases in the U.S., clearly regarded this as a triumph for his campaign. ‘All politicians should be congratulated when they admit a mistake,’ he said, ‘and it is a credit to Vince Cable that he has backed down.’ But Reprieve was not going to stop there. Shortly afterwards, the group was tipped off that the Arizona Department of Corrections had been charged £4,528.25 in September 2010 for the supply of drugs normally used in executions by a company based in Acton, West London, called Dream Pharma. It is fair to say that Dream Pharma is not a pharmaceutical giant. In fact, its offices are based behind a shabby shop front for the Elgone Driving Academy. A tatty blue sign in the window states that it is also the home for Dream Pharma. The company is run by Mehdi Alavi, and in January 2010, he reported his firm as having an annual turnover of £844,229, with a pre-tax profit of £94,460. Until the 2010 export ban, it was quite legal for Mr Alavi to supply the drugs, and there is no suggestion that he has ever acted outside the law. When he was confronted by reporters at the time, Mr Alavi simply stated: ‘It does not matter what I do. I am not even going to comment on anything.’ Since then, Reprieve has successfully continued campaigning both in Britain and worldwide. Towards the end of 2011, the EU also introduced an export ban. As a result, many U.S. states have found it almost impossible to obtain execution drugs. Lobby group Reprieve have called for Vince Cable to to impose a ban on the chemical - which he first refused. He changed his mind in November 2010 . Some are resorting to desperate measures to get hold of them, and Missouri has even imported drugs from Oklahoma — which goes against its own state laws. With a shortage of drugs, some states are now considering resorting to the use of other methods of execution, some of which are far less humane than lethal injections. In Tennessee, for example, the state legislature has passed a bill that permits its Department of Corrections to use the electric chair if no drugs can be found. In Wyoming, one senator is demanding the return of firing squads. Clearly, botched executions, the restoration of firing squads and electric chairs can all be regarded as constituting an enormously troubling — if unintended — fallout for Reprieve’s campaign. Naturally, Ms Foa strenuously denies anything of the sort. ‘The execution of Clayton Lockett was not an example of the wrong type of drugs being used to kill someone, but a particularly horrendous demonstration of the fact that there is no such thing as a “humane” lethal injection execution,’ she told me. ‘It is a myth. Botched lethal injection executions have been happening since prisons started using medicines that were intended to help people to kill them instead.’ Whatever side of the debate people stand on, it is clear that in the future, judicial killings in the United States could become more like sinister experiments than executions. No matter how unpalatable it sounds, it appears the road to a more hellish form of death has been paved by those with  good intentions.","Clayton Derrell Lockett executed at Oklahoma state penitentiary .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A mother who killed her two children while suffering from postnatal depression has been seen at her £1.5million home with the husband who stood by her throughout the tragedy. Jewellery designer Felicia Boots suffocated the couple's ten-week-old son Mason and 14-month-old daughter Lily days after the family had moved into their new home in south west London, in May 2012. Boots, 36 was suffering postnatal depression at the time and was under the delusion that her children were about to be taken away from her by social services. Scroll down for video . Felicia Boots, 36, who killed her two children while suffering from postnatal depression, has been seen for the first time since the tragedy with her banker husband Jeff, 36 . She was spared jail when she was sentenced at the Old Bailey in London, and was instead detained in a psychiatric hospital until doctors deemed her fit for release. At the time, a judge said a prison sentence would be 'wholly inappropriate'. Mr Justice Fulford, who described Boots as 'someone who delighted in being a mother' had also told the court: 'This is an almost indescribably sad case. 'Although the results of Mrs Boots's actions were profoundly tragic . given the loss of two young lives, what occurred was not criminal . activity in the sense that expression is normally understood. 'I . unreservedly accept that what she did to the two children, that she and . her husband loved and nurtured, were the results of physical and . biological factors beyond her control.' Now, nearly two years after the tragedy, the 36-year-old has been seen in the neighbourhood where the incident occurred with her banker husband Jeff, 36 . Residents in the area, known as ‘Nappy Valley’ because of its popularity with young, rich families, were surprised to see the couple return, but pleased that their lives looked to be getting back on track. One neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, told The Sun: ‘People thought she'd never return because the memories must be awful, but we're pleased that she appears to be recovering. ‘Those who know them are humbled by the strength of their relationship. It's a tribute to their character that they appear to be picking up the fragments of their lives. ‘Her treatment has clearly worked and you've got to hope they can find peace.’ Mrs Boots was suffering from post natal depression and feared her children would be taken away when she suffocated her ten-week-old son Mason (pictured) and 14-month-old daughter Lily . Mr Boots had returned home to find his wife sitting in darkness, and his children lying side by side on the floor of a walk-in wardrobe . Boots was supported by her husband after she admitted two charges of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility in October 2012. At the time, she told the Old Bailey: ‘I will be eternally sorry ... but I am a good mum and I never meant this to happen.’ Her not guilty plea to two murder charges was accepted by prosecutor Ed Brown QC. Her husband, who was in court, has stood by his wife. On the night of the tragedy, he returned home from work to find the house in darkness and his wife sitting on the stairs, hugging herself. He ran upstairs and found their children lying side by side on the floor of a walk-in wardrobe in the master bedroom of the semi-detached house. They had apparently been strangled, the Old Bailey heard. Mr Boots was heard wailing: ‘My lovely son, my beautiful daughter. They have gone. Help me, help me, help me.’ Felicia Boots, pictured, was supported by her husband after she admitted two charges of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility in October 2012 . Police at the family home. Mr Boots told officers at the scene that his wife was a good mother and he 'could not believe that she would do such a thing' His wife had been diagnosed with postnatal depression after the birth of both children. She had been prescribed antidepressant medication and her condition outwardly appeared to be improving. Hours before she killed her children she sent a photograph taken on her mobile phone of Lily to her husband, who took this as a sign that she was feeling better. He was unaware that she had stopped taking the medication because she was worried about its side effects while breast feeding despite reassurances from her doctor. Computer records show she made a series of Google searches about her concerns in the preceding weeks. In a note found next to the bodies she ‘questioned how she could have done such a thing’. She wrote how ‘she was scared and sorry’ and that her ‘life started to fall apart a few weeks before’. Her husband called the emergency services but paramedics were unable to save the children. His wife, who was ‘unsteady and weak on her feet’, was arrested. Mr Boots told officers at the scene that his wife was a good mother and he ‘could not believe that she would do such a thing’. The couple live in a £1.4million home in an area of south-west London known as Nappy Valley because it is popular with young, rich families . Many new mothers will experience a brief period of feeling emotional, irritable and tearful after giving birth, which is commonly known as the 'baby blues'. The latest figures show 85 percent of mothers can feel this way and it usually starts around three to ten days after giving birth and only lasts for a day or a few days. However, for a smaller percentage of mothers these feelings can develop into a deeper and longer-term depression, known as postnatal, or postpartum depression. Around 10 to 15 percent of new mothers are affected, with symptoms usually developing within six weeks of giving birth, although it can be several months later. Common symptoms of the depression include low mood, believing you are unable to cope, difficulty sleeping and feeling like you’re not emotionally connected to your partner or baby. Charity the Association for Post Natal Illness says it is contacted by 9,000 women every year who are suffering from depression. Research has also shown that around one to four percent of men experience depression while their child is under one. As long as postnatal depression is recognised and treated, it is a temporary condition you can recover from, according to the NHS. Experts advise mothers to ask for help, however many people don’t seek treatment because they might not recognise what’s happening or may feel afraid to ask. Treatment for postnatal depression can include self-help techniques, cognitive behavioural therapy and antidepressant medicine. PND is thought to be the result of several factors including the physical and emotional stress of looking after a newborn baby, hormonal changes and social problems including anxiety over money, and women who have a previous history of depression are deemed to be more at risk. Some mothers experiencing depression can have some obsessive thoughts, become very frightened about doing something wrong, being in some way inadequate and having their baby taken away, or fear they may harm their baby in some way. Most women who experience it won’t act on these thoughts, but it can still be frightening. If a mother is afraid that she may cause harm to the baby or herself then she should talk to her doctor as soon as possible. Infanticide cases in the UK are very rare. Figures compiled by the Office For National Statistics from between 2010/11 and 2012/13 show that in 6.4 per cent of the 1,1715 recorded homicide cases from that period the victim was aged under two (around 110 children). Between 1995 and 1999 in England and Wales, 80 per cent of homicide victims under one year old were killed by a parent, according to research by the Home Office. However, there are currently no statistics available for how many infant deaths were attributed to postnatal depression.","Felicia Boots suffocated her ten-week-old son and 14-month-old daughter .

"By . Katy Winter . One of the greatest and divisive romances of all time, the relationship between Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson, which saw the newly crowned king give up his throne for the American divorcee, continues to captivate the nation. Now a historic velvet settee where the two started their love affair is to be auctioned. The blush two-seater couch, measuring 60inch wide, has been restored to its former glory ahead of the auction, where it is expected to fetch between £2,000 and £3,000. Edward and Wallis, seen left on their wedding day, and, right, outside Goverment House in Nassau, the Bahamas, circa 1942, had one of the most controversial romances of modern times . When Lady Thelma - Edward's former girlfriend - discovered his love for Simpson she cut the sofa in revenge . The settee was owned by Lady Thelma Furness, Edward's girlfriend at the time, who introduced the pair during a party at her Burrough Court house in Leicestershire in 1931. The Prince of Wales, Lady Furness and Simpson would often talk together on the then three-seater couch, according to Northamptonshire-based auctioneer Jonathan Humbert. But when it was revealed the future king wanted to marry Simpson, Lady Furness cut up the sofa in revenge, he said. Now the seat is to be sold by auctioneers J P Humbert on May 22. Mr Humbert said: 'Every once in a while, something truly remarkable is offered for sale. After refusing to give Wallis - who, being twice divorced was considered unsuitable for a king - up, Edward eventually abdicated the throne in favour of his brother . The blush two-seater couch, measuring 60inch in width, has been restored to ahead of the auction, where it is expected to fetch between £2000 and £3000 . 'This is one such item - this is a true one off complete with provenance. 'This really is the original ""seat of love"" where arguably the greatest love affair of the 20th century began. 'Nobody knew it at a time, but this settee was set to change the course of history.' In 1934 Edward transferred his affections from Lady Furness to Simpson, who had recently divorced her husband Ernest after years of living 'beyond their means'. Lady Thelma had been visiting New York with her family, and on discovering Edward and Wallis’s new relationship cut down the seat to two seats. The sofa has been restored from the frame up and has been re-upholstered in period blush pink velvet. Included in the auction lot is a DVD with images of the restoration a former auction catalogue with ‘Borough Court’ provenance. The twice-divorced Simpson was consider totally inappropriate for a reigning monarch to marry . Few . could have imagined, as the 20th century dawned, that an American . socialite would prove the cause of the biggest constitutional crisis the . Royal Family has ever faced. But Wallis Simpson was no ordinary socialite and her future husband Edward VIII, no ordinary king. The pair met in January 1934 and twice-divorced Simpson and the then Prince of Wales swiftly fell in love. At . first the relationship raised few concerns, Edward was notorious for . his affairs with society ladies, but that all changed when George V died . on January 20, 1936. When, . the next day, the new King-Emperor chose to watch the proclamation of . his accession in the company of Simpson, it became clear that he . intended to marry her. This . precipitated a crisis, firstly because the political establishment . considered a twice-divorced woman an unsuitable consort, and secondly, . because Edward was now head of the Church of England, which at the time, . did not allow marriages between divorcees. Edward . suggested a morganatic marriage which would have prevented Simpson . becoming Queen Consort, but the prime ministers of the UK, Australia and . South Africa rejected the plan. By early December, the true nature of Simpson's relationship with the King had become public knowledge and she fled the country. Despite . attempts by Simpson to get him to reconsider, on December . 13, 1936, Edward abdicated and was succeeded by his brother, George VII. The couple eventually married, a month after Wallis' second divorce was granted, on the June 3, 1937 in the south of France. Although .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A surf photographer who went on a quest to find a Great White Shark spotted two swimming in the water - just 25 yards from the shore of a popular surfing beach. Gus McConnell managed to catch the moment on camera as the 6ft shark casually swam among boarders, just off 44th Street on Manhattan Beach, California. The photographer - who was so close to the shark he could have touched its tail fin - decided to go shark searching after reports from fellow surfers that a Great White Shark had been spotted in the water. Scroll down for video . Gus McConnell spotted a Great White Shark as he paddled in the water off 44th Street at Manhattan Beach, California . And amazingly, Mr McConnell - who paddled to three different spots to see the shark - believes he spotted two of the sharks during his search. 'The surfers were looking at me . like I was crazy, but the shark was acting docile. If I reached down I . could have grabbed his tail fin, but I didn’t want to push my luck,' he said. When Mr McConnell heard about the sightings, he equipped himself with a mask, snorkel and a Pentax waterproof camera before pushing himself out to sea on a prone paddleboard. He said: 'A neighbour was about to go surfing at 44th Street when some . guys coming out of the water said there was a shark swimming around. She . didn’t go out. 'A few other friends had mentioned sightings, so I figured they were hanging around.' When he failed to spot a shark at 44th Street, the determined surfer paddled another seven blocks to Rosecrans Avenue, where he hoped to catch a sighting. Gus McConnell, who lives near to the beach, had gone on a quest to find the shark after reports of sightings around the area . While he was there, Mr McConnell spotted a shadow lurking beneath him - which he believes was a Great White Shark. But due to poor visibility, the photos Mr McConnell tried to take were not clear. Before he had the chance to take another snap, the shark had disappeared. Mr McConnell then decided to paddle back to 44th street - where he 'got lucky' for the second time. He said: 'I paddled back to 44th Street and got lucky. A 5ft to 6ft shark was circling the surfers, not more than 25 yards from shore. Manhattan Beach, a popular swimming and surfing beach, where the shark was spotted - twice . 'Unless the one at Rosecrans followed me, I think this was a different one.' Mr McConnell managed to photograph the Great White Shark as it swam between surfers' boards in 6ft of water. He used his left arm to follow the shark, while clicking away with his camera using his right arm. Mr McConnell said he believes the shark, which was about the size of an adult human, was a young Great White Shark, based on its white belly, girth, and length. Sharks generally eat fish and not mammals until they measure around 9ft.","Gus McConnell spotted a Great White Shark at Manhattan Beach, California .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Health officials have confirmed a second U.S. case of a mysterious virus that has sickened hundreds in the Middle East. The latest case is not an American — he is a resident of Saudi Arabia, visiting Florida, who is now in an Orlando hospital. He was diagnosed with MERS, or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Sunday night. It is a respiratory illness that begins with flu-like fever and cough but can lead to shortness of breath, pneumonia and death. Scroll down for video . Deadly: MERS belongs to the coronavirus family that also includes the common cold and SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome . The man is at Dr. P. Phillips Hospital in Orlando. He arrived there with relatively mild symptoms, is stable and doing well . Fortunately, the U.S. cases so far have not been severe. The first case, a man in Indiana, was released from a hospital late last week. And the second patient is doing well, officials said. The two cases are not linked, officials said. 'The risk to the public remains very low,' said Dr. Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. MERS is a respiratory illness that begins with flu-like fever and cough but can lead to shortness of breath, pneumonia and death. Most cases have been in Saudi Arabia or elsewhere in the Middle East. But earlier this month a first U.S. case was diagnosed in a man who traveled from Saudi Arabia to Indiana. That man, an American, was a health-care worker at a hospital in Saudi Arabia's capital city who flew to the United States on April 24 on a plane that originated in Riyadh, stopped in London and then landed in Chicago. The man took a bus to Munster, Indiana where he became sick and went to a hospital on April 28. He improved and was released from a Munster hospital on Friday. Tests of people who were around the man have all proved negative, health officials have said. Contagion: This map shows the route that the man hospitalized currently in Orlando traveled after contracting MERS . The first case, discovered in Indiana on May 2, involved a male health care worker who was living and working in Saudi Arabia who fell ill on his return to the United States . Health officials now must track down fellow travelers who were around the newest case, and this time it will be more challenging: There were more flights involved. This man also was a health-care worker at a hospital where MERS cases were being treated, the CDC said. He traveled on May 1 on flights from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, first to London, then to Boston, then to Atlanta, and finally to Orlando. He went to a hospital on May 8 and was placed in isolation. The first flight was Saudi Airlines flight 113 to London, according to a Public Health England press release. The U.S. government did not identify the flight information for the other legs. Health officials did not immediately release additional detail about his travels or his week in Florida, except to say he was not at any theme parks and remained in the Orlando area to see family. The man is at Dr. P. Phillips Hospital in Orlando. He arrived there with relatively mild symptoms, is stable and doing well, but there is no timetable for his release, said Dain Weister, a spokesman for Florida's health department. As early as the first flight, the latest case was suffering fever, chills and a slight cough. That doesn't necessarily mean he infected anyone. Experts think MERS cases are most infectious when they are severely ill, with symptoms like pneumonia and difficulty breathing, Schuchat said. CDC: CDC spokesman Dr. Alan Kumar has announced there has been a second detected case of MERS in the United States . However, health officials are trying to contact as many as 500 people who were on the three flights within the United States to let them know the situation and watch for symptoms. People on the flight from Jeddah to London also will be contacted, CDC officials said. MERS belongs to the coronavirus family that includes the common cold and SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which caused some 800 deaths globally in 2003. The MERS virus has been found in camels, but officials don't know how it is spreading to humans. It can spread from person to person, but officials believe that happens only after close contact. Not all those exposed to the virus become ill. But it appears to be unusually lethal — some estimates have suggested it has killed nearly a third of the people it sickened. The estimate has been dropping as health officials have begun diagnosing more and more cases with less severe illness. But the estimated fatality rate for MERS still is far higher than what's seen with seasonal flu or other routine infections. Fortunately, it is not as contagious as flu, measles or other diseases. There is no vaccine or cure and there's no specific treatment except to relieve symptoms. Overall, 538 people have been reported to have the respiratory illness, including 145 people who have died. So far, all had ties to the Middle East region or to people who traveled there. As many as one-fifth of cases have been in health-care workers, Schuchat said.","Second case of MERS detected in Orlando, Florida announces the CDC .

"By . Martha De Lacey . A young, overweight virgin who worried he would never find a girlfriend when the scales tipped 20 stone has launched himself into a fitness programme, toned up, lost five stone... and found love. Ben Davis, 21, from Rochford, Essex, struggled with weight all his life, was bullied during his school years and found it awkward and embarrassing even talking to girls. Bullies called him 'the chubby kid' and 'fatty boom boom', and would laugh at him when he got out of breath running up stairs. Ben before losing the weight, left, and now with his new girlfriend Fern, who says she is sure she would have fancied him even before he began working out . He said: 'I always had some friends but most of . them were cousins and I would never have gone up to a girl in school . because I was so afraid they would laugh in my face. 'When I got older everyone I knew was going on nights out and wearing trendy clothes and I couldn't think of anything worse.' Even after leaving school, he was left embarrassed by his 19st 8lb frame, turning down nights out with his friends in favour of staying in eating junk food. He gorged on a diet of fast food, always . choosing the large option in places like McDonald's, and never turning down chocolate bars and crisps. Ben, pictured left before the weight loss and right after, said: 'My man boobs were so big I could easily have borrowed my sister's bra to keep them up' And when the weight kept piling on he used . food as a comfort and ate continuously through the evenings, unable to pull himself out of his unhealthy lifestyle. He said: 'Instead of helping myself I just got stuck in the same rut of eating everything that was bad for me and doing no exercise. 'My man boobs were so big I could easily have borrowed my sister's bra to keep them up. 'I was so embarrassed about how I . looked with my top off that I used to go swimming in a T-shirt. I didn't . want anyone to see me.' But after attending a bodybuilding event with his cousin, Ben realised that he couldn't deal with looking the way he was. Ben and Fern are now completely besotted with each other, and even though Ben has showed her pictures of himself before losing the weight, she says 'it doesn't bother me' 'I was really interested in doing . bodybuilding, but my cousin told me that I wouldn't even be able to . start trying until I had lost a serious amount of weight. 'That night I stood in front of the mirror and was repulsed at what I saw. 'I had spent the day surrounded by all . these men that were toned and had amazing bodies and I was foolishly . thinking that I could look like that if I just started lifting weights. 'I then realised something needed to change as I couldn't go on the way I was.' Ben said: 'The raspberry ketone pills really . accelerated the weight loss I was already achieving through a better . diet and exercise. I could not have done it without them' Raspberry ketone refers to the aroma compound of fresh raspberries. It is used in both the food and cosmetics industries for a fruity scent and flavour. Approximately . one kilogram of the fresh fruit is required to produce just 1-4mg of . pure raspberry ketone. This makes it one of the most expensive natural . food flavourings, at around $20,000 a kilogram. Though raspberry ketone has been on the Food . and Drug Administration (FDA) safe list since 1965, it has only been . marketed as a weight-loss supplement since 2004 after a study in Japan . found it prevented weight increases in mice on a high-fat diet. No . similar studies have been conducted on humans, and critics believe one . would need to consume huge quantities of the product to see the same . kind of results as the study with mice. Ben began researching diets on the . internet and spotted an advert for Forza raspberry ketone supplement pills . which he began taking alongside a high-protein diet. In five months he . lost five stone. He said: 'I remember doing four weeks of really heavy duty training. I checked my weight and I had only lost 9lbs. 'But by then I was hooked. Gradually I learned more about diet and nutrition and the weight just fell off me. 'The raspberry ketone pills really . accelerated the weight loss I was already achieving through a better . diet and exercise. I could not have done it without them.' Then, at a family party, Ben couldn't believe it when a girl took an interest in him: 'I couldn't believe it when Fern told me she thought I was fit. I hated my body and couldn't see how any woman would be attracted to me. 'I have always had weight issues since I was a kid and could never imagine anyone would ever be interested in looking at me, even after I lost all the weight.' It was instant attraction between the couple, but Fern, 18, says that she would still have spotted him if he hadn't lost the weight. Fern, also from Rochdale, Essex, who is training to be a hairdresser, said: 'I spotted Ben and instantly thought he was gorgeous. 'I sent my friend over to tell him at first as I was too shy but as soon as we got chatting I felt so comfortable around him. 'He showed me pictures from before he lost weight and it didn't bother me. I got to know him and it's his personality I fell for.' Forza Supplements managing director Lee Smith said: 'We were delighted to help Ben Davis achieve his ultimate goal. 'He is lovely lad and we are thrilled that he has finally found happiness. 'Our Raspberry Ketone capsules are particularly popular with young men who like to body build like Ben. They help them to lose crucial body fat so that they have a better body equilibrium when they do lose bulk.'","Ben Davis, 21, from Rochford, Essex, lost weight in five months .

"By . Darren Boyle . An undersea explorer who claims to have found the wreck of Christopher Columbus' flag ship the Santa Maria believes that looters have stolen some artifacts from the wreck site - including a cannon. Barry Clifford, from Massacheusetts said he believed he found the 500-year-old wreck off the coast of Haiti in 2003. During his earlier dive, Mr Clifford photographed a large cannon which has since gone missing prompting fears that looters have scavenged the site. Scroll down for video . Barry Clifford believes this cannon, photographed in May 2003 belongs to the Santa Maria but was later stolen by looters . Barry Clifford, pictured, said all the evidence points to the wreck being the Santa Maria . Mr Clifford said the Santa Maria went down on Christmas Day in 1492 after striking a reef off the coast of Haiti . Speaking at a press conference at the Explorers Club in New York, Mr Clifford said the evidence 'strongly suggests' the wreck is that of the Santa Maria. He said he would now be seeking authorisation from the Haitian government to begin recovering artifacts from the wreck site. The Santa Maria went down on Christmas Day in 1492 after striking a reef. According to Mr Clifford: 'I think the evidence is overwhelming that the ship is most likely the Santa Maria. Mr Clifford has already opened discussions with Haitian authorities and begun talks with the country's president Michel Martelly. The Santa Maria was believed to have been sunk after striking a reef off the coast of Haiti on Christmas Day 1492 . Mr Clifford said he discovered the wreck after studying Christopher Columbus' logs . Mr Clifford said that a cannon discovered at the scene in May 2003 was of the same design used at the time of Christopher Columbus' maiden voyage . The 68-year-old adventurer said the wreck is lying in 10-15 feet of water approximately five miles offshore. Columbus, abandoned his ship after running into the reef and returned to Spain, leaving some of his men behind in a fortified camp called La Navidad. However, when he returned the following year, all of his men were dead. Clifford said some ballast rocks lying at the site could be linked to a quarry near Columbus' home port in south western Spain. Mr Clifford said immediate action was required to save what remains of the vessel. 'I think this is an emergency situation. I think the ship needs to be excavated as quick as possible and then conserved and then displayed to the world.' 'I hope to be able to work with the . Haitian government and with all other countries including Spain in . helping to preserve this irreplaceable resource.' The Santa Maria's anchor is on display in Haiti having been salvaged from the ship before it went down . Roger C Smith, underwater archeologist for the state of Florida added: 'The evidence, as you can imagine, after more than 500 years is not going to be very much because of time and the environment that the site is in.' Mr Clifford's exhibition is being funded by this History Channel . The 58foot ship was the flagship of the expectation, but its final whereabouts have never been known - until now. Christopher Columbus on Santa Maria in 1492, in a paiting by Emanuel Leutze from 1855. Experts now believe they have discovered the wreck of the ship off the coast of Haiti. The route of the first voyage - and the final resting place of the Santa Maria . Previous researcher has found the daring seafarers who went on Christopher Columbus’ second trip to the New World in 1493 had major obstacles to overcome in their journey. Not only were they stepping into the unknown to find a home, but a new study suggests they may have also suffered from scurvy while sailing across the Atlantic. The scurvy killed many of the early colonisers, researchers claim, causing the ultimate demise of the La Isabela settlement within just four years of it being founded. This is according to historic documents and analysis of 27 skeletons buried at Columbus' settlement in what is now the Dominican Republic. Researchers believe the colonisers beat most of the scurvy by the time they died, but the disease may have contributed to a wave of deaths in the early colony. La Isabela, the first permanent European town in the Western Hemisphere, was abandoned within just four years of being established amid sickness and deprivation. Bones of sailors and colonists from graves behind the abandoned village's small churchyard have been unearthed from the site since the 1980s. La Isabela was established in what is now the Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. It was one of the first European settlements in America. It was founded by Christopher Columbus during his second voyage in 1493 and named after Queen Isabella I of Castile. Historic documents and analysis of 27 skeletons buried at Columbus' settlement in what is now the Dominican Republic suggests the early colonisers suffered from severe scurvy . Hunger and disease is thought to have soon led to mutiny, punishment, disillusion, and more hunger and disease. A group of settlers, led by Bernal de Pisa, attempted to capture and make off with several ships and go back to Spain. La Isabela's demise took place in 1496 when Columbus decided to abandon it in favour of a new settlement, which is now known as Santo Domingo. ‘They were still encased in earth when we started the study. We had to clean the bones to proceed,’ study author Vera Tiesler told National Geographic. Historians have blamed smallpox, influenza, and malaria for the town's failure, but the latest study by Mexico's Universidad Autonoma de Yucatán argues scurvy was the main cause. At least 20 of the 27 skeletons had signs—ridges carved in the outer lining of bones—of what the study describes as 'severe scurvy.' Scurvy, caused by one to three months of vitamin C deficiency, plagued seafarers until the 18th century. Symptoms included lethargy, anaemia, and, the re-opening of old wounds. Researchers suggest the voyagers might have avoided scurvy if they'd sailed directly from Spain to La Isabela - a journey of two months or less. When Columbus and his companions reached the Americas, they landed at a Hispaniola outpost first. ‘It was especially long, this trip - three months. And that's exactly the time scurvy needs to be in full bloom,’ Professor Tiesler said.","Researchers 'confident' excavation will prove the ship's identity .

"By . Tom Leonard . Separated by more than 50 years and an ocean of experience, they were the unlikeliest of bosom friends. He was a retired Irish priest — albeit a worldly one — and she was a wealthy, 21-year-old American student who was soon to become the most glamorous woman in the world. And yet, from their first encounter during her visit to Dublin in 1950, Jackie Kennedy was ‘enchanted’ with Father Joseph Leonard, a 73-year-old friend of a friend, as he chaperoned her around the city, taking her on a trip to the theatre and Dublin’s finest French restaurant. They were to meet only once more, but in an astonishing 14-year correspondence, she poured out her hopes, fears and secrets to the old priest with a candour she admitted she never extended to anyone else. Private letters: Jackie Kennedy pictured with Father Joseph Leonard in Dublin, Ireland, in 1950. They would only meet once more before he died in 1964, but their 14-year correspondence would shed fresh light on Jackie's most private thoughts . In 33 newly discovered handwritten . letters, amounting to some 130 pages, the famously tight-lipped Mrs . Kennedy writes freely of her suspicions about JFK’s fidelity, her . reservations over his frightening ambition and her utter loneliness and . anger at his tragic death. In . correspondence before and after she joined her husband in the White . House, she admitted the rising political star was consumed by ambition . ‘like Macbeth’. Writing in . 1953 — the year they married — she said that politicians were ‘a breed . apart’ but admitted that she too was vulnerable to their craving for . attention. ‘Maybe I’m just . dazzled and picture myself in a glittering world of crowned heads and . Men of Destiny— and not just a sad little housewife,’ she told the . priest. Never seen before: Philip Sheppard of Sheppard's Irish Auction House in Durrow, Co Laois, says that the letters came from 'a private source' ‘That world can be very glamorous from the outside, but if you’re in it — and you’re lonely — it could be a Hell.’ It . may have taken decades for star-struck Americans to realise their . revered president was a ruthless and vain womaniser, but his wife saw it . even before she married him. In . July 1952, she had confided to Father Leonard that: ‘I think I’m in . love with . . . John Kennedy — he’s the son of the ambassador to . England.’ She continued: . ‘Maybe it will end very happily — or maybe, since he’s this old and set . in his ways and cares so desperately about his career, he just won’t . want to give up that much time to extracurricular things like marrying.’ She . also admitted that she saw some of the characteristics of her own . hard-drinking, gambling and womanising stockbrother father, John ‘Black . Jack’ Bouvier, in JFK. Bouvier divorced her mother when Jackie was just . ten, and it is said he was so drunk at her wedding to JFK that her . stepfather had to step in to escort her to the altar. Young love: JFK and Jackie pictured in the early days of their courtship. At this point, Jackie was already writing to Leonard, likening her future husband's womanizing ways to those of her father . Jackie wrote: ‘He’s like my father in a way — loves the chase and is . bored with the conquest — and once married needs proof he’s still . attractive, so flirts with other women and resents you,’ she told Father . Leonard at the end of 1952. ‘I saw how that nearly killed Mummy.’ If . Kennedy ever did ask her to marry him, she mused, ‘it will be for . rather practical reasons — because his career is this driving thing with . him’. She clearly managed to overcome her initial qualms, telling her . priest friend in 1954: ‘I love being married much more than I did even . in the beginning.’ If she . was always forgiving of Jack, she wasn’t always quite so kind about his . family. Father Leonard clearly provided an outlet for her to whisper the . things she dared not say out loud. She . once wrote witheringly of her mother-in-law, Rose: ‘I don’t think . Jack’s mother is too bright — and she would rather say a rosary than . read a book.’ Newlyweds: The couple married in 1953. A year later, Jackie writes in a letter to Leonard: 'I love being married much more than I did even in the beginning' The treasure . trove lay undisturbed for 50 years in a safe at the priest’s former . seminary, All Hallows College, in Dublin, until being discovered by . chance by a visiting book valuation expert. Made available to the Irish . Times, they are expected to fetch at least £1 million when they go up . for sale next month. Kennedy . experts have been stunned by the haul. For while Mrs Kennedy was privy . to some of the most extraordinary years in White House history, she . refused to write a memoir or even give an interview in the last 30 years . of her life. Friends who . betrayed her confidences were immediately ostracised. Father Leonard, it . appears, may have been her only real confidant. ‘It’s so good in a way . to write all this down and get it off your chest — because I never do . really talk about it with anyone,’ she told him. She . was even ready to criticise God to him after JFK’s assassination in . Dallas in 1963, revealing her anger at the Almighty for taking away the . man she loved just months after the death of a son [Patrick], who lived . for only two days. Shaken faith: Jackie, pictured with her young children at JFK's funeral in November 1963, shares her heartbreak with Leonard, admitting that she had become 'bitter against God' ‘I am so . bitter against God,’ she wrote in early 1964 on a letter on . black-bordered paper. Soon, she wrote again, telling the now 86-year-old . priest: ‘I feel more cruelly every day what I have lost — I always . would have rather lost my life than lost Jack.’ But . she didn’t want to raise their children ‘in a bitter way’. She added: . ‘God will have a bit of explaining to do to me if I ever see him.’ But . she would keep praying, she said sadly, as ‘I have to think there is a . God —  or I have no hope of finding Jack again’. It was one of her last . letters to the priest, who died in the autumn of 1964. At his funeral, a . bouquet of red roses lay on his coffin — sent by Mrs Kennedy. As . one might have expected with a priest and a practising Catholic, their . correspondence had a religious aspect. Father Leonard sent her books . about the lives of the saints and she admitted he had rekindled her . interest in religion. In . early 1952, she wrote: ‘I terribly want to be a good Catholic now and I . know it’s all because of you. I suppose I realised in the back of my . mind you wanted that — you gave me the rosary as I left Ireland.’ Longstanding friendship: Father Leonard and Jackie, pictured in 1950 during their initial meeting, corresponded faithfully over the course of 14 years . She . was so smitten with him that it got on JFK’s nerves when the two . friends met a second time, this time on a visit by the Kennedys to . Dublin in 1955. The couple and Father Leonard were guests at a dinner . hosted by Declan Costello, son of the Irish prime minister and his . glamorous wife Joan. Jackie . recalled in a letter to the priest: ‘Our happy marriage was nearly rent . asunder because Jack was enchanted with Joan, and I was enchanted with . you — but somehow we patched it all up at the movies.’ In . letters, she addressed him as ‘Father L’, always signing off: ‘XO’. That, she felt she had to explain to the man of God, meant ‘hugs and . kisses’. One particularly effusive letter ended: ‘Bushels, barrels, . carts & lorry loads of love to YOU — Jacqueline XO’. Another . finished with ‘XXX OOO’. What . was it about Father Leonard that so captivated the young American? The . bon viveur and well-read cleric was certainly no ordinary Irish priest. He had spent much of his priesthood in London, teaching in a Catholic . teacher-training college in Twickenham. Jackie's men: Sitting with John F Kennedy just before they married in 1953 . During . World War I, he served as a British Army chaplain on the Western Front, . an experience that left him partially deaf. In London, he moved in . literary circles, counting playwright George Bernard Shaw among his . friends. When he retired to Dublin, he was often visited by friends of a . wealthy American couple he had befriended in London — including Mrs . Kennedy. Biographers of . Jackie Kennedy have never realised the importance of Father Leonard to . her. One biographer noted casually how she enjoyed the company of a . priest who ‘embraced a joyous form of Christianity that saw no conflict . between religious piety and enjoying the finer things in life’. B . ut as Mrs Kennedy confided to Father Leonard, he was someone who ‘loves . everything I love — who you can have FUN with . . . whom you can talk . to about anything in the world and know you won’t shock them’. We . may never know exactly what he thought of her because his letters . haven’t been found, but we can surmise her high opinion of him was . reciprocated, although she reveals how he also accused her of being . fickle, calling her a ‘girouette’, the French for weather-vane. Perhaps . he had in mind her revelation that she almost married someone else — a . stockbroker named John Husted — with whom she was so ‘terribly much in . love’ in 1952. And yet within months, she was confiding that she had . fallen for another man, JFK, and her engagement to Husted was swiftly . ended. When Jackie Kennedy . Onassis died in 1994, obituarists noted with regret that she had . remained largely a mystery by keeping so silent about her past. Now, thanks to an unlikely but firm friendship, the curtain has been pulled back a little.","The letters were sent to Joseph Leonard, a Vincentian priest in Dublin .

"By . Steph Cockroft . and Mail On Sunday Reporter . Health officials are trying to contact hundreds of passengers who flew into Britain on the same plane as a man hospitalised with a deadly SARS-like virus. The man, who is thought to be a US doctor or nurse, fell ill after flying from Saudi Arabia to Chicago via Heathrow. He is believed to be the first American case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS. The unnamed man is recovering in a hospital in Indiana. Health officials are trying to contact hundreds of passengers who flew into Britain on the same British Airways plane as a man hospitalised with a deadly SARS-like virus. Two passengers have already been tracked down . Two British passengers have already been tracked down by health chiefs over fears they could have contracted the deadly virus. Public . Health England made the announcement after it emerged two passengers had . sat next to the American man, according to the Telegraph. MERS, . which is similar to SARS, has killed 107 people so far, with 345 confirmed cases . worldwide. About 140 of these have been reported since the beginning of . last month. Professor . Nick Phin, head of respiratory diseases for Public Health England, said . human-to-human transmission of the virus was ‘extremely rare’. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, also known as MERS, is a viral respiratory illness first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Little . is known about the condition but it has been found in bats and camels. Experts believe it is most likely humans were first infected by camels. Symptons include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. It is also spread among human who have close contact, experts say. So . far, all the cases have been linked to six countries in or near the . Arabian Peninsula, although it has spread to around 15 countries across . the world. Latest . figures from the World Health Organisation show there are at least 345 . reported cases. Of these, 107 have been killed by the condition. But . he told any passengers on British Airways flight 262, which left Riyadh . on April 23, to call 111 if they experienced respiratory problems or . felt unwell. After arriving at Heathrow, the unnamed man transferred to a flight for Chicago, America, where he was taken to hospital three days later. Mr Phin said the chances of passengers contracting the virus were very low, but that investigations - particularly into any passengers who continued on the second flight to America - were still continuing. Most cases of MERS cases have been found in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries. But, with cases emerging in Britain, Greece, France, Italy and Malaysia, there are growing concerns about the potential global spread of the disease, mainly through airline passengers. The biggest reason for concern is that so little is known about the virus. It has been found in bats and camels and many experts say camels are the most likely way in which humans are infected. But the virus is also spread between humans who are in close contact with one another. According to the World Health Organisation, 107 people have been killed by MERS since 2012, while at least 345 have been infected. At least 140 of those cases have been reported since the . beginning of April. Mr Phin said: 'It's important to stress that the risk of the infection being passed to other passengers on Flight 262 is extremely low and there is no evidence from similar investigations of any evidence of person-person transmission. Egyptian Muslim pilgrims shown wearing masks as a precaution against MERS, which was first detected in Saudi Arabia in 2012. There are fears the virus will be spread further during pilgrimage season as millions of Muslims descend on the country to visit Mecca . Map of the world showing where MERS has been detected around the world, between April 2012 and April 2014 . 'PHE . staff have contacted - or have alerted the relevant public health . authorities in other countries - all but one of those passengers that . we know to have been sitting close to the case. 'We . are also in the process of informing other passengers on the plane, who . were not sitting in immediate proximity to the case, although all the . evidence shows that such individuals will have been at extremely low . risk. Particles of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome . 'None . of the passengers that have been contacted have reported any illness or . symptoms. We would only undertake laboratory tests if a passenger had . relevant symptoms. 'Our investigations into risks for any UK citizens on the flight from London to the US are continuing.' Dr . Anne . Schuchat, director of the Center for Disease Control's national center . for immunization and respiratory diseases, said the first American case . of . MERS was 'of great concern because of its virulence'. She . said the case represents 'a very low risk to the broader general . public', but MERS has been shown to spread to healthcare workers and . there are no known treatments for the virus. There is . now concern the disease could be spread further as millions from around . the world start to visit Mecca and other holy sites in Saudi Arabia for . the pilgramage season. The main Hajj season is in October this . year, but many Muslims also make Umrah, a less busy pilgrimage, throughout the year. The Saudi health minister Abdullah . al-Rabiah was sacked by the king last month after criticism the number . of MERS cases was rising. Mr al-Rabiah was criticised for not responding . effectively to the spread of the disease. Egypt, from where many of the pilgrims travel, has now issued a warning against travel to Saudi Arabia. The country's health ministry also said it was warning children under 15 and adults over 65, pregnant women and anyone suffering from chronic heart and chest diseases to postpone their pilgrimages. MERS causes a fever and a cough, but the effect can vary dramatically, with a high mortality rate in some people, but a majority testing positive with minor symptoms or none at all.","Health officials are trying to contact hundreds of passengers on flight .

"By . Associated Press . and Helen Pow . The United States is flying 'manned' intelligence missions over Nigeria in an effort to locate from the sky more than 200 abducted schoolgirls, a senior U.S. official said Monday. Washington . has also shared 'commercial satellite imagery' with the Nigerian . authorities in the hunt for the missing teenagers, the senior . administration official said, asking to remain anonymous. Officials have given their permission for the U.S. missions to take place. The . news comes after a chilling new video was . released by the extremist group Boko Harem, who have apparently forced . the Christian teens to convert to Islam. Scroll down for video . Misisons: U.S. 'manned' missions are flying over Nigeria in an effort to spot the girls, pictured in video by Nigeria's Boko Haram terrorist network, released Monday . Where are they: The kidnapped schoolgirls are seen at an unknown location in this still image taken from the undated video . Under the guns of their captors, dozens of barefoot girls sat huddled together wearing gray Muslim veils as they chanted Quranic verses in Arabic. 'I swear to almighty Allah, you will not see them again until you release our brothers that you have captured,' the leader of the terrorist network threatened, an assault rifle slung across his chest. The video released by the group Monday offered the first public glimpse of what it claimed were some of the nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped a month ago. The girls' plight has spurred a global movement to secure their freedom. It is not known how many suspected Boko Haram members are detained by security forces. Hundreds were killed last month when leader Abubakar Shekau's fighters stormed the military's main northeastern barracks in Maiduguri, the terror group's birthplace and the headquarters of a year-old military state of emergency to put down the 5-year-old Islamic uprising. In the video, two of the girls were singled out for questioning. 'Why have you become a Muslim?' one girl, who looked to be in her early teens, was asked. Leader: The group's leader Abubakar Shekau, pictured int he latest video, speaks to the camera . Words of terror: 'I swear to almighty Allah, you will not see them again until you release our brothers that you have captured,' the leader of the terrorist network threatened, an assault rifle slung across his chest . 'The reason why I became a Muslim is . because the path we are on is not the right path,' the girl said, . nervously shifting her body from side to side, her eyes darting back and . forth. 'We should enter the right path so that Allah will be happy with us,' added the girl, who said her name had been changed to Halima because she had converted from Christianity to Islam. Like the other girls, she wore a bulky gray hijab that covered her body from head to toe, revealing only her face. A second girl, who appeared to be in her mid-teens, was asked if she or any of the others had been mistreated. No, she said, adding that they had experienced nothing 'except righteousness.' As the girls chanted Islamic verses, some clasped their hands together in what appeared to be the Christian style of prayer before quickly turning their palms upward, as Muslim worshippers do. The girls' families have said most of those seized April 15 from a school in the northeastern town of Chibok are Christians. It was impossible to fully authenticate the video, though parents were trying to turn on a generator in Chibok, hoping to watch the video and identify their daughters, said a town leader, Pogu Bitrus. 'There's an atmosphere of hope - hope that these girls are alive, whether they have been forced to convert to Islam or not,' he told The Associated Press by telephone.

A Nigerian government statement said it was reviewing the video and would 'continue to explore all options for the release and safe return of our girls back to their homes.' In a video last week, Shekau threatened to sell the girls into slavery. It arrived amid unverified reports that Christians among the students had been forced to convert to Islam and that some were taken to neighboring Cameroon and Chad, where they were forced to marry their abductors. Boko Haram means 'Western education is sinful.' The latest video, obtained by The Associated Press, came through channels that have provided previous messages from Shekau, who spoke in the video in the Hausa language of northern Nigeria.

On Saturday he said allowing Western soldiers onto Nigerian soil could make the country a new magnet for foreign Islamic militants who want to confront the United States and others.

"By . Damien Gayle . Rising star: A young Elvis Presley in the recording studio. The contract he signed with music impresario Colonel Tom Parker is to go under the hammer . Fans of Elvis will be all shook up to hear that the very first contract signed by the rock and roll star is to go under the hammer this week. The agreement between Presley and his ruthless manager, Colonel Tom Parker, signed at Sun Records' studio in Memphis, Tennessee, came just before the singer rocketed to international superstardom. It was also the beginning of a relationship between the two men that was to last until Presley's death, and which was heavily criticised when investigations into the star's estate began. The sale of the document is being . handled by Julien's Auctions of Los Angeles, California, but the auction . itself will be held at the Hard Rock Café in New York City on Saturday, . May 17. It's estimated to reach anything up to $25,000. Presley's career began in 1954 when he joined Sun Records in Memphis, Tennessee, and recorded 24 songs. Word . started to spread throughout the industry of a talented young singer . and in February 1955, Col Parker, who had already had some success in . talent management since the late-1930s, made his approach. Presley . initially agreed to let 'the Colonel', as he was known, organise some . of his future bookings and promotions and gradually he became known as . his 'special advisor.' In . November that year, Col Parker successfully persuaded RCA Victor to buy . Presley's contract out from Sun Records for $40,000 - an almost unheard . of sum in those days. Fatefully, it also guaranteed the Colonel a 25 per cent commission on the young star's gross income. One for the money... The signed agreement between Presley and his ruthless manager, Colonel Tom Parker, came just before the singer rocketed to international superstardom by joining RCA Victor . The contract also guaranteed the Colonel a 25 per cent commission on the young star's gross income . After Presley signed the official agreement his career went from strength to strength and it was with RCA Victor he released his most famous tracks, including Heartbreak Hotel, Hound Dog, Love Me Tender, Jailhouse Rock, Blue Suede Shoes and All Shook Up. The document has survived the last 59 years in pristine condition - just slightly yellowing - and features signatures by Elvis and his parents Vernon and Gladys Presley. Elvis's mother, Gladys, gives her boy as kiss at the contract signing: The deal was to forge a link between Presley and Col Parker, far left, that was to endure throughout the rock and roll icon's life . Fateful day: Bob Neal, Sam Phillips, Coleman Tily, Presley and Col Parker at Sun Studio on the day of the signing . Darren Julien, chief executive of Julien's Auctions, said: 'This is one of the most significant contracts, the one that Elvis signed with Col. Tom Parker. 'Before that, I believe he was working with his mother. 'This was the start of his life and it was a very important decision in his career, and it was a very historical moment for his parents, who were there when he signed the contract. 'Col. Parker was Elvis's manager for the majority of his career and pretty much all of his big hits were released while they were working together. 'There was a lot of controversy surrounding Col. Parker and the relationship he had with Elvis. He was very controlling and had a lot of influence over him. 'He controlled his finances and it was because of him that Elvis never performed in Europe, as he didn't like Elvis flying. 'Although a lot of people say Col. Parker was controlling of Elvis, he actually helped make Elvis into the superstar he was. 'This contract has never been offered publicly and it is a really rare item. 'It's in very good condition and it's estimated to fetch up to $15,000 but I think it could get $25,000 because it's so significant.'","Presley signed the contract with the entertainment impresario in 1955 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The only surviving ‘Lord Kitchener Wants You’ First World War recruiting poster in public hands has gone on the market for £15,000. The incredibly rare poster was responsible for the enlistment of millions of men and has since become one of the iconic images of the war. But despite its success and popularity, it was not produced on the same scale as other recruiting posters - and only three originals have survived. Patrick Bogue of Onslow Auctions is selling the incredibly rare piece of history, which is only one of three left in the world . The other two are in the Imperial War Museum in London and the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia, meaning this poster is the only one in the world that can be bought. The poster started off life as the front cover of a 1914 edition of magazine London Opinion which had commissioned renowned artist Alfred Leete. The Parliamentary Recruiting Committee, which commissioned all the recruiting posters, spotted the artwork and turned it into a poster of their own. It was then plastered on billboards and hoardings around the country - but unlike other recruiting posters only around 10,000 were made. Lord Kitchener, Secretary of State for War featured on the iconic poster after it appeared on the front cover of a London magazine . Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, was a well-respected military leader and the poster became one of the enduring images of the war effort. The poster was so successful it was copied by the Americans who replaced Kitchener with Uncle Sam. Kitchener was killed in 1916 when the warship taking him to negotiations in Russia was sunk by a German mine. The poster for sale was bought at auction in 1983 for £100 and has been in a private collection ever since. Experts have tipped it to fetch £15,000  when it is sold online by Dorset-based auction house Onslows. The poster will go on public display at Chalke Valley History Festival in Wiltshire from June 23 to 29 ahead of the auction on July 9. Patrick Bogue, auctioneer, said: 'When war broke out in 1914 the British army only had a real problem on their hands because they only had about 150,000 soldiers. 'Lord Kitchener was a respected leader and strategist who had found fame in the Boer War and during the last days of the British Empire. 'He was too old to serve as a general and so he was hired to take on the mammoth role of recruiting more soldiers. 'Most recruiting posters made by the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee that were reproduced in the hundreds of thousands and distributed to all corners of the British Empire. 'But perhaps only 10,000 copies of the Lord Kitchener poster were made and they would only have gone on display in Britain. 'The reason is that the poster was first made by Alfred Leete for the front cover of London Opinion magazine. 'It was so popular that the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee sought permission to use the front page as a recruiting poster. 'The only thing different was that they changed the wording from ‘needs you’ to ‘wants you’. 'It was a hugely successful poster and was responsible for tens of thousands of men enlisting in the Army. 'Only two other original copies exist and they are both in museums. 'The Lord Kitchener poster is the holy grail of historic recruiting posters and this copy is the only one in the world that you can actually buy.' The poster was purchased in 1983 for just £100 and is expected to fetch at least £15,000 when it is auctioned later this summer .","Kitchener poster is only one of three surviving examples of the iconic print .

"By . Leon Watson . Robbie Williams has been caught out boasting about a bizarre meeting with World Cup star Diego Maradona - only to find he was just a look-alike, it emerged today. The singer, 38, was tricked by a 49-year-old German into thinking he had bumped into Argentinian's most famous footballer after the pair bumped into each other up a mountain. Williams then posted a picture online of himself and the impersonator with the message: 'The Hand of God meets God. I wish he was playing this year's Soccer Aid! £Maradona'. Robbie Williams has been tricked by Germany's most famous Maradona double after he spotted him in the ski resort of Ischgl in the southern Austrian province of Tirol . He also posted on his Twitter profile the message: 'How random, just bumped into Maradona on the mountain. RW x.' But 12 days later it was revealed the man was in fact Germany's most famous Maradona impersonator, who has been making doubles appearances for the last 20 years. The pair met in the ski resort of Ischgl in the southern Austrian province of Tirol. Williams had performed at the Top of the Mountain Concert in Ischgl on May 3 at 2,300 metres altitude on a giant open air stage. Mr Atici, who is well-known in his home country, said: 'I am Maradona's double. I work in a sports shop and come from Bad Dietzenbach, but for the last 20 years I have been making appearances as Diego Maradona. 'I was discovered when I went to a football game between Bayern Munich and Naples in 1989 - the next day there was a picture in the local paper saying that Maradona had been in the stadium.

I never thought such a world famous star would fall for my double act. It is sensational. It all happened so quickly. I will never forget that day!' Williams met the real Maradona in 2006 in a charity football match in aid of Soccer Aid which raised over £6 million for UNICEF. Williams captained the side which beat a World XI 2-1 at Old Trafford. Both teams fielded seven celebrities and four former footballers, including Diego Maradona for the world side.

"By . Helen Pow . An animal shot dead by a coyote hunter in Iowa in February was the first gray wolf spotted in the state since at least 1925, DNA testing has confirmed. The hunter, who hasn't been named, shot the female wolf near Fairbank in northwest Buchanan County believing it to be a similar-looking coyote. It is legal to shoot coyote in Iowa, though hunting wolves is illegal as they are a protected species. On closer inspection, the hunter thought the supposed coyote may have been a wolf and brought the animal to the DNR office in Manchester, where biologists examined it and took DNA samples. Gray wolf: An animal shot dead by a coyote hunter in Iowa in February was the first gray wolf spotted in the state since at least 1925, DNA testing has confirmed. This image shows the same species in Minnesota in 2011 . Iowa previously had two sub species of gray wolf - the Great Plains wolf and the gray timber wolf. But they were systematically killed or driven out of the state by Iowa settlers who considered them a threat to their livestock. According to the 2012 wolf status report, a reliable researcher concluded that Iowa's last valid wolf record occurred in Butler County in the winter of 1884-1885. However, a timber wolf was shot in Shelby County in 1925, though it's not clear if it was wild or had escaped captivity. 'I was surprised but not that surprised,' DNR furbearer specialist Vince Evelsizer told The Gazette, describing his reaction to the news given the fact Wisconsin and Minnesota each have substantial wolf populations. Similar: The hunter shot the wolf believing it to be a similar-looking coyote. A gray wolf is pictured left alongside a howling coyote, right . 'Large animals can cover great distances, and state lines mean nothing to them,' he said. The hunter was not cited, DNR Conservation Officer Scott Kinseth said, as they believed the shooting was a genuine mistake. Kinseth said the hunter was extremely cooperative and had no idea he was doing anything morally or legally wrong. But he warned hunters in future to think before they shoot. 'They are protected animals. We know they are here. Make sure of your target. If in doubt, don't shoot,' he told The Gazette. The wolf was a healthy female weighing between 65 and 70 pounds. This is normal size for wolves in neighboring states but about twice as heavy as the average coyote.","The hunter, who hasn't been named, shot the female wolf near Fairbank in northwest Buchanan County believing it to be a similar-looking coyote .

"By . Maggie Harbour . Dean McDermott packed his bags and headed for Canada again, leaving his troubled wife alone on Mother’s Day! Dean returned to Toronto Saturday afternoon to film his number one Canadian show, Chopped Canada, after it was picked up for another season. But sources say, no one works on Sunday and McDermott certainly could have spent at least part of the holiday with the mother of his four children. ‘Tori and Dean’s relationship has been so bad, that you would think he would have done his best to spend at least part of the day with Tori,’ says a source. ‘But for some reason he felt he had to fly into the Canada on Saturday, leaving Tori on her own for Mother’s Day.’ Don't leave us: Dean lleft Tori and their four kids behind and flew off to Toronto on May 9. Toronto was the city where he cheated on his sad wife . To add salt to the wound, Tori’s mom Candy Spelling was also out of town promoting her new book, Candy at Last, so the 40 year old actress couldn’t even share a Mother’s Day meal with her mom. ‘At a time when Tori should have been surrounded by people who love her, she was alone with the kids, waiting on them and seeing to their every need,’ says the source. ‘My heart goes out to her.’ The source confides that the last thing Tori and Dean need right now is for him to leave town. And to make matters worse… the job is going to require him to be away for six to eight weeks! In the episode of True Tori that aired last night, the couple hotly debated his return to Canada to film the show's second season. But MailOnline learned exclusively that his leaving was a fait accomplis. McDermott 47, hosts the show, Chopped Canada, which is the Canadian version of Food Network’s US Chopped  series, and the network is thrilled with the ratings. But the timing is terrible for him to return to work, right in the middle of he and Tori trying to put the pieces of their marriage back together. Working girl: Tori has a lot on her mind as she makes her way to the studio today. She can't join Dean in Toronto because the two older kids are in school and she's working on her new TV series . ‘Tori and Dean have been pulling out all the stops in an effort to save their marriage,’ says the source. ‘They desperately want to stay together for the sake of their four children, Liam, 7, Stella who turns 6 in June, Haddie, 2 ½ and 1 ½ year old Finn. Tori wants nothing more than for things to go back to the way they were before Dean cheated last December, but no matter how much counseling they go through – as seen on their reality show True Tori – things don’t seem to be getting better. ‘Dean is adamant about the fact he strayed because he wasn’t getting enough attention at home, but Tori calls that ‘unfair,’ saying that for half their marriage she was pregnant, carrying his kids! ‘Tori and Dean just celebrated their 8th anniversary,’ says a source. ‘And she has been pregnant for four out of eight of those years. So to criticize her for not being into sex enough for his tastes is just plain cruel. Chop chop: Dean hosts the show, Chopped Canada and the network is thrilled with the ratings . Not only was she pregnant all that time, she’s been taking care of back to back babies practically since the day they walked down the aisle. And she suffers excruciating pain due to recently diagnosed spinal disc problems. ‘And caring for her family is not her only job,’ adds the source. ‘She’s also busy pitching ideas for projects, filming her shows, and taking care of responsibilities like doctor and dentist appointments for the children.’ The source says what makes Dean’s departure even worse is he’s returning to Toronto – the scene of his cheating! And Tori can’t join him because the two older kids are in school and she’s working on her new series with Jennie Garth. ‘It was when Dean was in Toronto the last time that he met another woman and ended up cheating on Tori,’ says the source. ‘And of course she’s worried that once he’s away again, the same thing could happen. Especially since things are a lot worse now than they ever were before he cheated. On her own: Tori  is left holding the fort with her kids in LA. She may be  alone when daughter Stella has to have her tonsils out in the next couple weeks . ‘Tori always says she didn’t understand his decision to cheat because the weekend before he betrayed her, they’d spent most of the weekend having great sex. So you can’t blame her for being worried. ‘This also means Tori might be in LA alone when their daughter Stella has to have her tonsils out in the next couple weeks. Unless Dean can convince the show’s producers to let him have a couple days off to go home and be there for his little girl.’ ‘Dean is also concerned that by leaving, it’s going to delay them finding a way to work through things,’ says the source. ‘He even thought about backing out of his commitments all together. But he is under contract and the show’s popularity has boosted his popularity too, not to mention the fact he took a pay hike this new season, and he and Tori are trying desperately to straighten out their finances.’","Dean McDermott left the family  the day before Mother's day even though there was no filming for his TV show Chopped Canada on the weekend .

"By . Meghan Keneally . The Standard Hotel has hired a top Hollywood lawyer and is desperately trying to track down the employee who leaked the security footage that showed Solange Knowles attacking Jay Z. The tape is believed to have been sold to TMZ for $250,000 after a bidding war. 'This was being shopped for five days to the highest bidder,' an unnamed source told The New York Post's Page Six. Moments later: Solange is seen exiting the elevator with Beyonce and Jay Z immediately after she attacked him for a yet-unconfirmed reason following a Met Ball afterparty . The investigation process is ongoing but has been limited to the handful of people who would have had access to the hotel's surveillance footage. The hotel, which is known for hosting . premiere parties and celebrity soirees, is anxious to track down whoever sold the tape because the footage is legally theirs and they do not want . to be seen as breaking the trust of their wealthy patrons who crave . privacy. On the hunt: The Standard is a regular venue used for celebrity after parties but that is based on their dedication to their client's privacy . The Standard quickly put out a statement after the release of the tape, which said: 'We are shocked and disappointed that there was a clear breach of our security system and the confidentiality that we count on providing our guests. We are investigating with the utmost urgency the circumstances surrounding the situation and, as is our customary practice, will discipline and prosecute the individuals involved to our fullest capacity.' The statement- and the footage itself- confirmed the veracity of the video which made it hard for the rapper's team to dial back. 'Once it was out, Jay Z’s people felt they couldn’t control it. They were reluctant to try and publicly fight this,' the source told the paper. Because the tape does not include audio, the world has been left to wonder what caused Beyonce's younger sister to violently lash out at her brother-in-law. The latest theory from alleged insiders pieces together various different aspects. Sources told The Post that while Solange was reportedly 'provoked' during an outburst with designer Rachel Roy before getting in the elevator, the singer was dealing with a number of emotional and financial problems that came to a head at that moment. 'She used to be on (Jay Z’s) label, but now she isn’t. And she moved to New Orleans from Brooklyn with her son. Solange still spends a lot of time in New York, but she is further away from her family, which has created some issues,' a source told the paper. 'Clearly she was on something at the party, she was drunk and out of it. The girl is crazy and prone to outbursts. She got in the elevator with Jay and Bey. He had made a comment that she didn’t like, and she just snapped,' another person said. The incident occurred as the Carter-Knowles clan was leaving The Standard Hotel after party for the Met Ball and Jay Z was reportedly headed to Rihanna's separate party without his wife. Tensions: Sources claim that Solange Knowles is angry that her brother-in-law's label dropped her as an artist and she has grown more distant from her family after moving to New Orleans with her son . Some reports have argued that Solange may have been overreacting in defense of her sister- who is seen standing in the corner as Solange attacks her husband. For their part, the notoriously-tight-lipped couple have let their actions speak on their behalf. Beyonce and Jay Z have sat courtside at two Brooklyn Nets games since the fight occurred, putting on a united front. She has also effectively made a statement through social media, and even though Solange took the public move of deleting all-but-one traces of Beyonce from her Instagram feed, Beyonce posted four old, tender photo of she and her sister on various trips.","The Standard hotel has launched an investigation into which of their employees leaked the security footage .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Police investigating the January murder of a beloved 61-year-old Catholic school teacher in Chicago have discovered a pile of escort ads in his suburban home, it was revealed Thursday. Alan Filan, a long-time business instructor at Brother Rice High School, was discovered stabbed 14 times in his Orland Park home January 21. Alisha Walker, a 21-year-old prostitute from Ohio, was arrested days later in Indiana and charged in Filan's stabbing death. Slain: Chicago Catholic school business teacher Alan Filan, 61, pictured here during a lecture, was found stabbed 14 times in his home in January . Solicitation: Police found 20 escort ads on Filan's desk from the website Backpage.com . The murder suspect has spent the past three months in jail, and she is due back in court May 28. Chicago Sun-Times reported Wednesday that investigators working the crime scene in the 9400 block of Georgetown Square back in January came upon 20 Bakcpage.com ads advertising female escorts of Mr Filan's desk. The 61-year-old teacher, who had spent 39 years working at Brother Rice High School, was stabbed to death January 18. His body was found in his home at around 10.30am January 21 after a staffer at an Orland Park hotel, where Filan apparently had been moonlighting, called police asking to perform a welfare check. Murder suspect: Alisha Walker, 21, a prostitute from Akron, Ohio, has been charged with knifing Filan to death in a dispute over money . Filan's autopsy report indicated that the man was found lying face up on the floor under a bay window in his kitchen. He suffered 14 knife wounds in the back of his neck, chest, arm and abdomen, as well as additional cuts and bruises. Bloody prints left by a pair of high-heeled shoes led responding officers from the body to the door, police said. Detectives investigating the slaying were able to track Alisha Walker to a motel in Fort Wayne, Indiana, after reading text messages on Filan's phone that were sent from a number listed on a Backpage escort ad they had found in the teacher's home. When extradited to Illinois and questioned by police, the 21-year-old suspect said that she was acting in self-defense because Filan grabbed a knife in a dispute over her payment. The woman, whose extensive criminal record includes multiple charges for prostitution, drug possession and battery, told investigators that she had met with Filan in his house at least twice before the deadly January 18 encounter. Records obtained by the Sun-Times show that in December 2012, Walker was arrested for allegedly striking another woman over the head with a vodka bottle in an argument over money. She was also convicted on two prostitution charges in Cook County that year. Alan Filan taught at Brother Rice for four decades and was chairman of the school's business studies department. He also coached soccer at another Chicago school. Beloved curmudgeon: Those who knew Filan remembered him as a cantankerous man who had a warm heart beneath his tough exterior . Not strangers: Walker told police she had two other encounters with Filan in his home before January 18 . The . 61-year-old educator came from a politically connected family. His . brother, William Filan, is a Democratic lobbyist who represents the . interest of the City of Chicago, while his younger sister, Denise Filan, . is a Cook County judge. Following . his death, Filan's former students and colleagues eulogized the veteran . educator as a legendary figure in the community known for his bluntness . and hot temper, but also for his genuine warmth and willingness to help . his students. ‘He would call people “sugar britches,” but not in a derogatory way,’ Tinley Park Mayor Ed Zabrocki, who worked with Filan at Brother Rice, told Orland Park Patch back in January. ‘It was a term of endearment.’ ‘You could say he had a rough exterior, but it was paper thin,’ Zabrocki added. ‘When it came to it, he was always there for the kids.’ Her version: The 21-year-old escort told police she was acting in self-defense because Filan pulled a knife on her . During soccer practices at Victor J. Andrew High School, Filan would sometimes throw his clipboard and yell out things like, 'Here's a quarter... call someone who cares,' and, 'If you were a horse, they'd shoot ya.' But those who knew Filan well said he brought joy to everyone who was willing to put in the effort and made a real impact in the lives of his students. Filan taught us things we didn't know he was teaching us until years after we graduated,’ Nicole Hack, who played soccer on Filan’s team, told the paper.","Alan Filan, business teacher at Brother Rice High School in Chicago, was found dead in his Orland Park home January 21 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The worried daughter of missing radio personality Casey Kasem has vowed to do whatever it takes to get her father back, and is praying he's safe, wherever he is. Kerri Kasem, the 82-year-old's middle daughter, said Monday that she and her sister, Julie, had a 'wonderful' visit with their dad last Tuesday, just days before he was secretly moved from his out of a Santa Monica nursing home. She claims her estranged stepmom, Jean Kasem - Casey's current wife - is responsible for the disappearance, and that the woman moved him in the middle of the night without a court order or doctor's discharge. Scroll down for video . Casey Kasem, 82, suffers from advanced Parkinson's disease, can no longer speak and has been in various medical facilities chosen by his wife, Jean Kasem . Worried: Kerri Kasem, pictured right in 2005 with her father and brother, Mike, left, said she was worried for her father's health . 'I will do whatever I need to do to get my dad back!' Kerri, 35, told Closer. 'I'm praying that he is somewhere safe. I'm praying to God that he’s being cared for and that he's not getting sicker and sicker by the day.' As of Tuesday afternoon, the 'American Top 40' host is labeled a missing person following the court's decision to grant Kerri conservatorship of her father's health. Kerri's May 6 visit was the first time she'd seen him in five months, after an attorney helped secure them access to his room. 'They let me and my sister in to see him and it was a wonderful visit,' Kerri said. 'My dad said, ""I love you."" 'Dad was animated. He was smiling. He moved his arms a little bit. He knew we were there,' she added to Closer. 'When we went to leave, we said, ""Dad, we'll be back soon. We'll be back soon."" That's when he looked up at us and was able to say the word, ""When?"" We said, ""Dad, as soon as we can,""' she said. Speaking of Jean, one of Kerri's attorneys, Martha Patterson, told Closer she has no authority as a healthcare agent or Casey's wife to move him out of the facility without permission from a doctor. 'I cannot imagine someone in his condition being carried out without proper medical equipment,' she said. Kerri added tearfully that she's 'filled with an extreme amount of worry' for her father. Video courtesy of Extra TV . Daughter Kerri Kasem had sought a temporary conservator-ship and was appointed her father's temporary caretaker on Monday . Family: Radio Personality Casey Kasem, is seen with wife Jean Kasem, daughter Kerri Kasem, son Michael Kasem and daughter Julie Kasem on January 25, 1985. The children are from another marriage . The daughter's words come after a judge ordered an investigation into the whereabouts of the comedian after an attorney for the ailing man's wife said he had been removed from the country. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Daniel Murphy ordered a court investigator and adult protective services to find out where Casey Kasem is being treated and report back to the court. The elderly radio personality suffers from advanced Parkinson's disease, can no longer speak and has been in various medical facilities chosen by his Jean Kasem. Casey Kasem's children had earlier complained they had been unable to see their father in accordance with an agreement with their stepmother. Kerri had sought a temporary conservator-ship and was appointed her father's temporary caretaker on Monday. Her attorney, Troy Martin, said the family believes the entertainer has been taken to an Indian reservation in Washington state. Murphy's order came after Craig Marcus, an attorney who appeared on Jean Kasem's behalf at Monday's hearing, said he did not know where the radio personality was but knew that he had been removed from the country. 'I have no idea where he is,' Marcus said. The . revelation brought stunned protests from Murphy and two of Casey . Kasem's daughters, two of the entertainer's three children from a . previous marriage. Wife and husband: Casey and his wife Jean, shown in 2004 in Holllywood, California, have been married since 1980 . 'Your statements concern me even more,' the judge told Marcus, who declined to comment after the hearing. Marcus said in court that Jean Kasem had every right to move her husband as she saw fit. Murphy appointed a doctor to look into Casey Kasem's care and ordered a court-appointed attorney to find out his whereabouts as soon as possible. Casey Kasem gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, American Top 40 and Casey's Top 40, and was the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon Scooby Doo. As temporary conservator, Kerri Kasem will have access to her father's medical records and other reports that have previously been sealed by court order. Kerri Kasem's case is the second one opened by one of the former host's children to try to gain access to their father and have some oversight over his care. A previous case by daughter Julie Kasem was dismissed after she reached a settlement with her stepmother, but the daughter said on Monday that agreement has been breached. In a court filing last week, Kerri Kasem's attorneys wrote that the entertainer has been repeatedly moved without warning and his children have been unable to see him. The complaint accused Jean Kasem of elder abuse by isolating her husband from his family. 'We've been troubled for a long time,' Kerri Kasem said after Monday's court hearing. She said Murphy's orders will ensure that the truth about her father's care comes out. 'Justice has been served today,' she said.","A judge has ordered an investigation into the whereabouts of Casey Kasem .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Jacqueline Coltman, 42, has been cleared of attacking six guests during a fight after her friend's funeral . A woman was today cleared of attacking five mourners at a drunken wake after telling a jury she was acting in self defence. Jacqueline Coltman, 42, said she had been dragged into a pile of bodies when fellow mourners began brawling outside an Exeter pub. She was found not guilty of a series of assaults after insisting she had only struck out at people in order to escape from the crowd and avoid trouble. Ms Coltman did admit pulling one girl to the floor by her hair after mistaking her for another woman, and accepted a police caution. The violence flared up after family . and friends of Selina Nicholas attended her funeral at Exeter Crematorium . in December 2012 and a wake at the Windsor Castle pub in Heavitree. The prosecution alleged Ms Coltman launched herself at . the dead woman’s sister Mrs Owen, knocking her to the ground and . breaking her collar bone. Ms Coltman was also alleged to have punched a child in the chest, then bitten or scratched the other mourners during the ensuing brawl. However Ms Coltman claimed she had been made the . scapegoat for a series of brawls which spread through the car park . behind the pub and allegedly involved up to 20 people. Ms Coltman, of West End, . Minchinghampton, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, denied causing grievous . bodily harm to one guest, actual bodily harm to a 16-year-old mourner . and battery against three others. The fight broke out at this pub at Selina Nicholas's wke but a jury found Ms Coltman was not responsible . Wake: The drunken brawl occurred after the funeral of Selina Nicholas (pictured left and right). At an inquest into her death, the coroner was told the mother-of-seven died after getting addicted to a powerful legal high . She told the jury she had been . reluctant to go to the funeral because she was worried a long standing . argument with one of the mourners may flare up. She added that she had drunk a shandy and . three lagers and had got into an argument. She had then pulled the hair . of what she thought was a woman but was in fact a girl. She said: 'I grabbed her hair and . pulled her to the floor. I knew straight away it was not her. I told her . I was so sorry. I felt really bad. 'Someone jumped on my back and we ended up on the floor. We started fighting. I just remember being at the bottom of the pile. 'I don’t accept I beat up five to six . people including a bloke. They were all on top of me. I was hitting out . to get them off. They were all drunk. Half of them don’t know what went . on but blamed me for it.' Legal highs: Selina Nicholas, pictured, was found dead by one of her sons in 2012. Coroner Elizabeth Earland recorded an open verdict but said she could not establish for certain that legal highs had caused Selina's death . The alleged victims included the dead . woman’s sister Chiquita Owen, who suffered a broken shoulder, and . daughter Alarissa Nicholas, who was left with cuts and bruises. The jury took less than an hour to . clear her of all charges and there was applause and shouts of ‘Justice is . served’ from supporters in the public gallery. An inquest heard later that Selina Nicholas’s death was linked to the use of a powerful legal high.","Jacqueline Coltman, 42, not guilty of attacking six guests at friend's wake .

"By . James  Nye . Pedophile: James Napier seen here in one of his booking photographs was sentenced to 240-years in jail for horrific sexual abuse . A Cincinnati man described as an 'enthusiastic participant' in child pornography involving an 11-month-old and a nine-year-old showed no remorse on Tuesday as he was sentenced to 240-years behind bars. James O. Napier, 40, was ordered to pay $95,009 to his victims after being found guilty of recording a video of himself molesting the infant in November of 2009 and placing it online after having babysat the child. Napier, who was found in possession of 1,300 child pornography pictures and 550 videos, also videoed himself making the nine-year-old girl perform oral sex on him, which he also placed on the Internet. The undercover investigation into Napier, 40, began when FBI officials in Phoenix found Napier was actively trading online child porn across the globe. Despite the horrific nature of his crimes, the judge was stunned by his total lack of remorse during his trial. U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott said this was factored into his sentence. 'He sat still, emotionless. He did not appear ashamed. He did not appear concerned . 'He appeared anything but remorseful,' court documents state. Furthermore, the court was unsure how to demonstrate that justice had been done. 'The United States is unsure whether any sentence would he 'just punishment' under the circumstances,' said court memos. Despite the severity of his crimes Napier showed no remorse during the trial, which factored into his sentence . Napier claimed to the court that he himself had been sexually abused in the past and told a probation officer he was molested between the ages of five and 10 by an older cousin. 'If true, the events of Napier's childhood sex abuse are tragic. However, these events do not grant Napier the right to subject at least two small children to repeated sexual abuse at his hands,' court documents state. Testimony given during his trial revealed that in November 2009, Napier molested the 11-month-old after become involved with her aunt. Police also testified that his pedophilic porn collection contained images and videos of children less than five-years old being raped and tortured for sexual pleasure. 'The initial investigation of Napier identified him as an active and enthusiastic participant in a community of morally depraved individuals who trade child sex abuse images and videos to satisfy their sexual desires,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Muncy told the court according to Cincinnati.com. 'One of his victims, due to her age, may never know the abuse she suffered. The other will never forget.' The court heard that he abused the nine-year-old girl while her family were in the house. 'While they slept peacefully, she was being sexually assaulted by Napier. While they played in another room, she was forced to perform oral sex on him,' said court documents. FBI agents arrested Napier on Jan. 18, 2013. He has been held without bond. Napier was convicted following a three-day trial in January on nine counts of production of child pornography. The jury also convicted Napier of one count each of transportation of child pornography, distribution of child pornography and receipt of child pornography.","James O.

"By . Freya Noble . and Sarah Michael . and Emily Crane . The Abbott Government has come up against one of its first big hurdles since the Federal Budget was announced on Tuesday. New South Wales will not take on the proposed changes that will allow hospitals to charge patients $7 for a visit - the same price people will now have to cough up for a trip to their GP. The Government announced in the budget that restrictions which currently prevent public hospitals charging fees will be lifted. But NSW Health Minister Jillian Skinner said the new fee, designed to deter patients from visiting hospitals instead of GPs to avoid paying, would not be taken on board. Open to 'horse trading': Prime Minster Tony Abbott has said he knows he will need to negotiate to get tough new budget through the Senate . 'The NSW Government will not implement a co-payment for patients accessing our emergency departments,' Mrs Skinner told the Sydney Morning Herald. Meantime, Prime Minster Tony Abbott has said he's not opposed to 'horse trading' in order to get the budget through the Senate. The Labor Party and The Greens are set to allow the budget appropriation bills though parliament, the first of which was filed just hours after the announcement. Budget appropriation bills are designed to channel money through to departments and agencies, and draft laws to impose a deficit levy on high-income earners were introduced into the lower house on Tuesday night. NSW Minster for Health and Minister for Medical Research Jillian Skinner said that NSW will not charge patients $7 to visit public hospitals - a fee introduced to defer people from going to emergency rooms for non-urgent matters . Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has confirmed Labor will vote against the coalition's move to introduce a $7 Medicare co-payment, as well as plans to hike the fuel excise and change the pension age. Treasurer Joe Hockey insists the government is not cutting pension payments - they're just not going to increase as quickly as they do now. From late-2017 the indexed increases to the age pension will be linked to the consumer price index instead of the highest rate available, generally male average earnings. With inflation running at about 2.5 per cent pensioners will find their payments increasing by less than they've been used to in recent times. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten vowed to fight unpopular budget measures outside Parliament House in Canberra on Wednesday . LABOR TO FIGHT DOCTOR CHARGES, PETROL EXCISE . The pension is just one of a string of unpopular budget measures announced Tuesday, and Labor is vowing to try and block some of the key changes. 'Putting up everyone's petrol bill we think is a bad idea in the current circumstances,' Mr Shorten told the Nine Network on Wednesday. 'We will fight - and I don't know if we'll win the arguments against Tony Abbott and their bad budget - but we will fight and fight and fight for Medicare. 'We get that you've got to improve the health system and make it more cost effective but you don't do that by stopping people at the door of the doctor's surgery.' OPPOSITION QUIET ON DEFICIT LEVY BLOCK . But Mr Shorten refused to confirm whether the party would support the deficit levy on high income earners. 'What we think is it is a broken promise,' Mr Shorten said when asked about the coalition's plan to hike tax on people earning more than $180,000 a year. 'We haven't made a final position on that.' Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen said the Medical Research Future Fund was a great idea, but should not be funded by the Medicare co-payment. Tony Abbott has defended his government's unpopular first budget, saying it's 'fundamentally honest' 'It should not be funded by Australia's sick and vulnerable people,' he told Sky News. 'It should not be funded by people who may be on low and middle incomes who need to go the doctor.' LABOR OPPOSES PENSION CHANGES . He said Labor would oppose increasing the pension age to 70 because Treasurer Joe Hockey had failed to justify the decision. 'He says Australians should work longer than anybody else in the developed world,' Mr Bowen said. 'Not one country in the OECD has a pension age of 70.' BUDGET MEASURES 'NECESSARY', SAYS ABBOTT . 'I want to do what's right for the country, not what's right for the government,' Mr Abbott told the Nine Network on Wednesday. 'We are not going to cook the books, we are not going to make a series of rosy assumptions,' he said. The government cannot keep using its credit card to pay the nation's mortgage, he said. BROKEN PROMISES . Asked repeatedly whether the budget broke his key election promises, he told Network Ten: 'I think we have kept faith with the Australian public.' But he acknowledged: 'Some people will be disappointed, some people will feel let down.' TWITTER REACTION . Twitter users had a field day with Tuesday night's budget. The hashtag #ThreeWordBudget is top-trending in Australia as social media users express their reaction to the measures detailed by Treasurer Joe Hockey overnight. The hashtag #ThreeWordBudget is top-trending in Australia as social media users express their reaction to the measures detailed by Treasurer Joe Hockey overnight . TV host Charlie Pickering went for 'Less for more'. Actor Rhys Muldoon wrote 'Opus Dei Cuts', referring to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's links with the Catholic Church. 'Winter is coming' wrote social media commentator Jamila Rizvi in a clever reference to the fantasy television series Game of Thrones. 'Mine, all mine', 'Heart of Darkness', 'Fair Go Gone', 'Every promise broken' and 'Out of Touch' were some of the harsher tweets aimed at the first-term coalition government. 'Pass the Grange?' Cameron Brown tweeted, referring to the infamous bottle of red wine that triggered the resignation of former NSW premier Barry O'Farrell. 'Missing Gillard yet?' wrote producer Karen Pickering, while media commentator Jenna Price tweeted 'vote them out'.","NSW Health Minster announced there will be no fee to visit public hospitals .

"By . Candace Sutton . In less than 24 hours a smiling Angela Ferullo would be dead. In stunning family pictures of the 43-year-old at what should have been one of the most exciting times of her life, Ms Ferullo smiles beside her daughter Letitia at the christening of Letitia's baby Sierra. But in truth, stress and panic was already gripping Ms Ferullo. Less than a day later she would die in a frenzied attack after she threw herself in in front of her knife-wielding ex-husband in order to protect five months pregnant daughter Selina and Selina's unborn child. Less than 24 hours to live: Despite her smiles Angela Ferullo (right) was too stressed by threats from her crazed ex husband James Payet to pose for many more than this photograph with daughter Letitia at the christening of Letitia's baby Sierra. Following the 45 minutes church service, Ferullo left 'in  a panic'. A day later she was dead . Precious cargo: Five months pregnant Selina Bello (right) pictured with her sister Letitia holding baby Sierra at the christening less than 24 hours before the young women's mother, Angela Ferullo would be fatally stabbed by her ex-husband after she threw herself in the path of James Payet's frenzied knife attack and Selina's unborn child . Little did they know: Despite Angela Ferullo's fears for the safety of her family at the christening of baby Sierra (above, pictured in mother Letitia's arms at Christ the King Church in Perth), they could not know the escalating threats of Ferullo's ex husband James Payet would lead to his stabbing her to death and she leapt to protect her pregnant daughter Selina (on the right) Happy times cut short: the joy of baby Sierra's christening above shows on the faces of the Bello family, including mother Letitia (right). But a day later Letitia's mother Angela Ferullo would lie bleeding to death in the family hair salon after Ms Ferullo threw herself in front of her knife wielding ex-husband to save pregnant daughter Selina (centre) and her unborn baby's life . The attack by James Payet, who is not the father of Letitia and Selina, left Ms Ferullo fatally injured and Ms Bello with slash wounds. Ms Bello recovered from her injuries and gave birth to a healthy baby boy, Emilio, who is now five months old. James Payet has pleaded guilty to murder and kidnap and will be sentenced in the West Australian Supreme Court on Friday. In sentencing submissions for the murderer the West Australian Supreme Court heard Payet had repeatedly threatened Ms Ferullo in the days leading up to the attack in June last year. Fiercely protective: Angela Ferullo, pictured with her youngest daughter at the christening last June of her baby granddaughter Sierra, left the church soon after this photograph was taken, skipping the reception for fear that her presence would put her family in danger of attack by her violent ex-husband, James Payet . Worst fears: Angela Ferullo, pictured above with her daughters, pregnant Leitia (right) and Selina (left) at Letitia's baby shower last year when Ms Ferullo had separated from her crazed ex-husband who would eventually kill her during an attack on Selina . Mum's loving arms: Selina Bello is hugged by her mother last year several months before Angela Ferullo would save Selina and her unborn baby's life . On June 23 last year, the day of her granddaughter Sierra's christening, Ms Ferullo was so worried by her ex-husband's threats she was 'stressed' and 'panicked' during the 45 minute ceremony, posed only for a few photographs and left early, skipping the reception. 'She was worried [James Payet] would come to the church and threaten the girls,' a friend said, 'she was freaking out and kept checking her phone. 'She thought he might turn up any minute and hurt someone.' Mother's love: Angela Ferullo, left with daughters Leticia (centre) and Selina Bello (right). She died protecting Selina who was five months pregnant at the time . Fatal rage: In the days leading up to the murder James Bill Payet had made threats against his ex-wife, who was about to go to court to take out an order against him. But he stormed into the hairdressing salon where Angela Ferullo and her pregnant daughter Selina Bello were and attacked them with  a knife . On June 24, Ms Ferullo was at the hairdressing salon she owned with her daughter. She was planning to go to court to obtain a restraining order against Payet. Police had already made an order against Payet to stay away from Ms Ferullo after he made several threats to confronted her at her granddaughter's christening. Unbeknown to Ms Ferullo, who had spent the night prior to the murder staying elsewhere, Payet was hiding in the roof of her house and had confronted her male housemate, threatened him with a knife, and held him captive for two hours while demanding he call Ms Ferullo to tell her to come home. The housemate managed to escape Payet and jump over a back fence, but was chased to a nearby primary school where Payet managed to slash his shoulder and arm. Payet convinced a passing driver to try to pick him and they briefly pursued the housemate, who Payet claimed had broken into his home, before he asked to be dropped off and then drove a borrowed car to Ms Ferullo's salon. The housemate had alerted police, who were too late to prevent Payet bursting into the salon and attacking Ms Ferullo and her daughter. After failing to reach the housemate, Payet told the unsuspecting driver to drop him off elsewhere. He then borrowed a car and drove to Ms Ferullo's salon. The housemate asked the school to call police, who were on the phone to Ms Ferullo when a frenzied Payet burst into the salon. He first attacked Ms Bello, but turned on Ms Ferullo when she intervened to save her daughter. Healthy boy: Despite suffering serious wounds in the knife attack which killed her mother Selina Bello gave birth to a health baby boy who is now five months old, . In loving memory: Mother of four Angela Ferullo with her children before the attack by her ex-husband James Payet which left her dead and her pregnant daughter, Selina, wounded . Payet fled the scene and a massive manhunt ensued. He was caught when he later sought hospital treatment for self-inflicted wounds. Ms Bello and her unborn baby survived the attack, and her son, Emilio, was born late last year. In February, Payet, 48, pleaded guilty to murdering Ms Ferullo and causing grievous bodily harm to Ms Bello.  In a Facebook post, Ms Bello said some justice had been served after seven months of 'hell'. 'Mum, not a day goes by that we don't think about you and the great loss we have experienced,” she wrote on Facebook. 'Hopefully, now you can rest easy knowing that justice has and will be served.' Ms Bello has posted photographs of herself and five-month-old Emilio on Facebook, along with a loving message for her mother's birthday. 'Mum you were the strongest most inspirational woman I ever had the pleasure of knowing,' Ms Bello wrote. 'It tears me apart knowing that your not here with us celebrating today. 'There was never a problem that was unsolvable and never a question to hard. There was always room for friends and family and you never turned you back on anyone. 'I hope your looking down on us holding you head high with pride assured knowing that you will never be forgotten and your legacy will always live on through your 4 children.'","Stunning pictures show Angela Ferullo day before she was stabbed to death by ex husband James Payet .

"By . Sarah Dean . A band of four impossibly cute Cotton-top Tamarin brothers have moved into Sydney's Taronga Zoo . And the highly social primates, which are easily recognised by their long white 'punk like' sagittal crests extending from their foreheads to their shoulders, are said to be 'very cheeky'. The small New World monkeys have settled into their new home from Mogo Zoo, on the south coast of New South Wales, and are sure to be a star attraction in the state's capital. Keeper Kristal Thomson said the four brothers all have different personalities and research has indeed shown that Cotton-tops display both altruistic and spiteful behaviours. The species, which is found in tropical forests in north-west Colombia, eat insects and plants in the wild and play an important role as seed dispersers in the tropical ecosystem. In their new abode, the brothers will also get to feast on bugs, fruit and flowers. The little monkeys are a critically endangered species, having been threatened by both the illegal pet trade and deforestation in Colombia, where it is thought only about 6000 remain.

"By . Mail Online Reporter . A mother suffering from post-natal depression drowned her baby then dumped the body in a factory car park behind her home, a court heard today. Amy Black, 40, snapped after a sleepless night with seven-month-old daughter Zoe, who had been crying constantly because of ear pain. Nottingham Crown Court was shown CCTV of Black climbing a makeshift ladder and . tipping the baby’s body over an eight foot fence and into . undergrowth. Amy Black who pleaded guilty to infanticide at Nottingham Crown Court today. Her seven month-old daughter Zoe was found dead on land behind Black's home in Bestwood, Nottingham in September 2013 . Half an hour later, Black called 999 - but paramedics were unable to revive Zoe. Black pleaded guilty to infanticide on the grounds that she ‘caused the death of her child at a time when the balance of her mind had not recovered fully from giving birth’. The hearing was told a CCTV camera from the factory that bordered Black's home captured the events surrounding Zoe's death. The . court was shown footage of Black tending to Zoe, who was lying in a . cot near the patio doors.Two hours later, Black cradled Zoe in her arms. At 9.39am, Black held Zoe under her right arm. Two minutes later, Black scaled the makeshift ladder she had made from garden . furniture. Black then dropped Zoe on the other side of the 8ft high wire mesh . and into the factory car park. Minutes . later, she scaled the fence and stood at the point . where she had dropped her child. She then used the cordless phone and a . knife to cut her own arms and . neck. Neighbours, . paramedics and police who saw Zoe’s body said it appeared . ‘damp’ or ‘wet’. The court heard that a post-mortem . examination was unable to reveal exactly how Zoe died, but medical . evidence suggested the likely cause was drowning. Mr Spencer said Black told police: 'Don’t . bring Zoe back. She wanted to die. She’s been unwell because she’s been . crying a lot.' She went on . to refuse to comment in police interviews. Amy Black's home, behind where her daughter Zoe's body was found . Timothy Spencer QC, prosecuting, said . there was evidence to show that in the months leading up to the death, . Black’s mind was ‘significantly disturbed’. Black's husband told detectives his wife suffered periods of paranoia after Zoe’s birth, believing . neighbours were deliberately ignoring her because she was American. She . also developed a worsening dislike for their bungalow, claiming the . television was telling her ‘to do specific things’ such as leave the UK. Mr Spencer said she indicated she was having suicidal thoughts. She . went on to tell her husband that he was a UK . government employee who had been placed in their home ‘to spy on her’. The day before she killed Zoe, Black took a taxi to London with her daughter and booked into a room at a Premier Inn in Ealing. Nottingham Crown Court, where Black pleaded guilty to infanticide after the death of her baby, Zoe . But she had returned the next day after being tracked down by police. Black was remanded back into a secure unit to be sentenced on a date to be fixed in April. Isabella Forshell QC, defending, asked for the case to be adjourned for psychiatric reports. She said the defendant had been on 'a long, emotional journey'. She . told an earlier hearing Black had previously shown ‘tender care’ towards Zoe and there was no previous evidence of neglect or abuse. Black’s . husband Jack Black, 70, was not in court to hear his wife’s guilty plea. When . he was interviewed by police after his daughter’s death, Mr Black . described their situation as a ‘wonderful, perfect family living a good . and happy life’. But Mr . Spencer said police discovered there was a ‘unhappy side’ to their . relationship caused by ‘short-lived episodes of depression’. Feeling 'low' after having a baby, also known as the 'baby blues', is so common it is considered normal, but 10-15 per cent of mothers go on to develop a much deeper and long-term condition called post-natal depression (PND). It usually develops within six weeks of giving birth and can come on gradually or suddenly, and can range from being relatively mild to quite severe. Sufferers may feel sad or low, unable to cope, and hostile or indifferent to their husband, partner or baby.  They may have thoughts about death, be unable to sleep, and feel hopeless about the future. Many of those who suffer from it do not want to admit to it, but doctors say that if PND is diagnosed and addressed, it is likely to pass sooner and to be less severe. Post-natal depression usually develops within six weeks of giving birth. (Posed by model) Treatments for PND include counselling and psychotherapy, and antidepressants, which can be very effective.  Tranquilisers and sleeping pills may also be offered for short-term use. Some women find complementary therapies such as cranial osteopathy, massage, and reflexology can be a help in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. Practical and emotional support from friends and family has also been shown to be a great help to those suffering from PND.  Getting out to meet other parents can be a lifeline to new mothers who are feeling isolated and anxious after having a baby, while exercise can also work as an antidepressant. Organisations such as the Association for Post-Natal Illness provides a telephone helpline for women who believe they are suffering from PND and for medical professionals.  Call 0207 386 0868 Monday-Friday 10am-2pm. Another helpline for those suffering from pre or post-natal depression is run by Pre And Post-Natal Depression Advice and Support and is staffed 9am-8pm on 0843 28 98 401. Other telephone helplines available 24 hours a day include Parentline on 0808 800 2222 or the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90.Source: Mind.co.uk .","Amy Black, 40, snapped after a sleepless night with her daughter, Zoe .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Russia has come under fire for giving an 18+ rating to a child's computer game - because characters can be gay. The Sims 4 has been marked as 'harmful' to Russian youth by a Kremlin-appointed body because the country's strict anti-gay laws forbid children being exposed to same-sex relationships. British watchdogs are expected to rate the game as suitable for children as young as 12. The Sims 4 (pictured) has been marked as 'harmful' to Russian youth by a Kremlin-appointed body . Russia's anti-gay laws have long been the subject of protests, which gained worldwide coverage in the run up to the Olympics. Here, demonstrators pictured in London last summer hold placards depicting Putin in drag . But Russian officials have slapped it with their harshest possible rating, forbidding anyone under the age of 18 from playing the PC game. The previous version of the game, The Sims 3, also features same-sex relationships, and that was rated as suitable for ages six and up. Electronic Arts, the team behind The Sims, have lashed out at Russia's strict censoring policy and have vowed not to change the game ahead of its worldwide launch later this year. Spokesman Deborah Coster said: 'We have no plans to alter The Sims 4. 'One of the key tenets of The Sims is that it is up to the player to decide how to play the game. 'We provide the simulation sandbox and player choice and creativity does the rest.' Players of the game can pick their characters' sexual orientation. Here two female characters on Sims 4 kiss . A spokesman for the computer game, which British children aged 12 can play, said they will not make changes . The shock announcement of the strict age rating came on Twitter from The Sims In Russia. The equivalent age rating for British computer games would be 18, reserved for ultra-violent games such as Grand Theft Auto or Call of Duty. The Sims 4 fell foul of Russia's controversial 436-FZ law, which was passed in 2010 under the name 'On Protecting Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development.' The Sims 3, which has a 12-plus rating in Russia, was released in 2009, before that law came into force. Russian factory worker Aleksandr Yevseyev, 27, has played several of the games in the series. Aleksandr, from Samara, said: 'Millions of Russians play The Sims. It is a very good game. The controversy has sparked outrage, as some Russian players advocate 'a different version' for gay people . 'But I don't understand why this new game has to have so many problems. 'If some people want to be gay, let them buy a different version that allows them to be gay. 'I am not gay so I do not want to play as a gay Sim, but I have gay friends who might want to marry their gay Sim lover. We should have separate games. 'That could solve the problem. We are not European. We are Russian and our beliefs and way of thinking should not be judged according to Western ideas.' The new game is thought to be similar to its predecessor, where players control their Sims - virtual representations of themselves - in all manner of 'real life' situations like going to work or falling in love. Like all other games in the series, while romance and dating are possible, all sex-scenes are heavily pixelated and unclear.","Kremlin-appointed body has given Sims 4 highest possible rating .

"A lollipop lady used her body as a human shield to protect children from an out of control car, a court heard today. Karin Williams suffered multiple injuries after jumping in front of the vehicle outside Rhws Junior School, in Rhoose, the Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales, last year. She was left with broken legs, elbow, shoulder and ribs in the crash outside the school gates, and spent ten weeks in hospital recovering from her injuries. A 10-year-old girl who a had major head . injury was placed on life support following the crash, and a pregnant . woman was also hurt. Scroll down for video . Lollipop lady Karin Williams, 50, has told how she used her body as a human shield 'out of instinct' to protect children being mowed down by a runaway car outside a school in South Wales . Cardiff Magistrates' Court heard that Robert William Bell, 62, who was driving the M-reg Audi A4 convertible, had been coughing at the wheel moments before veering . across the road. His car flipped over on speed bump outside the primary . school. The court heard how . his car sent young children 'cartwheeling through the air' and inches . from death at 8.50am during the school run crash. Bell denies driving without due care and attention. He said he suddenly blacked out and then the next thing he knew he was upside down inside the vehicle. However, 50-year-old Mrs Williams - who has been helping youngsters to cross the road safely for the past 10 years - insisted the defendant was conscious moments before the accident. In a statement read aloud to the court, she said: 'It was a normal morning. I started at 8am to assist the children going to the school’s breakfast club. 'At 8.50am I was opposite the school helping children to cross the road when all of a sudden, I looked to my left, and saw a dark coloured car coming straight in my direction at speed. 'It was coming at an angle and was on the wrong side of the road. Ms Williams suffered a catalogue of injuries after jumping in front of the vehicle outside Rhws Junior School, in Rhoose, the Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales, last year . 'I remember seeing the man behind the steering wheel. His eyes were open and his hands were gripping the steering wheel tight. 'I think I shouted something to warn the kids and jumped in their direction to try and get them out of the way. 'The next thing I remember is being underneath the car.' District Judge Bodfan Jenkins was told on June 20, last year, Bell’s car had been driving as normal and keeping to the 20mph speed limit before suddenly accelerating. The 2.6 litre engine car, which had more than 160,000 miles on the clock, then suddenly veered across the road and hit parents and pupils before colliding with a bollard and sliding on its roof - dragging Mrs Williams in the process - before coming to a standstill. Five children and four adults were injured in the crash outside the primary school in Rhoose, South Wales, last June. Ms Williams was left with broken legs, elbow, shoulder and ribs in the crash outside the school gates. She spent ten weeks in hospital recovering from her injuries. Four . girls and a boy aged between five and ten were injured - including a . fractured skull, bleeding on the brain and broken bones. Cardiff Magistrates' Court heard that Robert William Bell, 62, who was driving the M-reg Audi A4 convertible, had been coughing at the wheel moments before veering across the road. His car flipped over on speed bump outside the primary school. He denies driving without due care and attention . A police officer collects the damaged 'Stop' lollipop sign from the ground near the accident . One . girl aged ten spent three days on a life support machine and has . undergone a series of operations - and still doesn’t have use of her . left arm. One mother, who had been walking her daughter to school, was flung into bush suffering a fractured pelvis after she was hit by the car. A woman who was 13 weeks’ pregnant at the time was also hurt, but went on to make a full recovery, the court was told. One mother, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, later told police her child was dead after he was found unconscious on the ground. 'We were on our way to school and I turned around and heard the sound of a loud car engine,' she said. 'The next thing I knew.... (my children) had been hit by the car. One of them was face down on the floor and unconscious. Eyewitnesses said they saw the defendant emerge from the crashed car bleeding from his head and looking completely dazed and confused . District Judge Bodfan Jenkins was told on June 20, last year, Bell¿s car had been driving as normal and keeping to the 20mph speed limit before suddenly accelerating . 'When my child came around he was crying and in complete shock.' Another parent described the aftermath of the crash to police as 'complete chaos'. She said: 'Parents and children were screaming.' Eyewitnesses said they saw the defendant emerge from the crashed car bleeding from his head and looking completely dazed and confused. Prosecutor Ms Jones said Bell was overheard saying: 'Did I do anything wrong? Was it my fault?' Police later found the defendant had been wearing flip-flops at the time, though the court was told the footwear had not caused the crash. Diabetic Bell had been driving past the school with a passenger in the front seat. The passenger later told him he had been coughing heavily just before the accident. Prosecutor Lisa Jones said: 'No-one but Mr Bell caused the car to veer across the road. 'A competent driver wouldn’t have driven the car that way. The real issue is whether he is responsible for the manner of the driving. 'He says he had no control because he was unconscious or unaware at the time.' He later tested negative for alcohol and although his blood sugar was 'higher than normal' it would 'not have caused him to blackout', the court was told. The overturned Audi is lifted with a recovery truck crane from outside Rhoose (Rhws) Primary School. A court heard the 2.6 litre engine car, which had more than 160,000 miles on the clock, suddenly veered across the road and hit parents and pupils before colliding with a bollard and sliding on its roof . Police later found the Audi was in 'good working order' despite its high mileage. However, Bell's barrister David James said a severe coughing fit had prompted his client to lose control of the car. The defendant said he was taken to hospital in 1998 with a severe chest infection. Bell told the court doctors believed he had suffered 'cough syncope' while on the ward - which can cause a person to faint. However, he said he had been unaware of this fact until the Crown Prosecution Service requested his medical notes ahead of his trial. The defendant also spoke of the moment he climbed out his car following the crash. He said: 'I saw one of the children on the floor...and blood was coming out of their mouth. 'The blood ran from the pavement to the gutter.' And after seeing lollipop lady Ms Williams at the front of the car and another woman who had been knocked down, he added: 'I thought three people had died. 'I walked to the centre of the road and stood there in shock for sometime.' Bell said until three months ago he was on medication for high blood pressure called Ramipril. Among its side effects include coughing, the court was told. The court also heard evidence from a front seat passenger who had been in the vehicle when the defendant lost control of the car. The witness, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said Bell had been coughing severely while at the wheel. 'I told him to stop because there was a red light, but the car just kept going,' they said. 'I looked across at him and his eyes were shut. 'I shouted at him ""stop"".... I thought he might have heard me. 'The next thing the car was upside down.' The trial continues.

"By . Jennifer Hyland . and David Meikle . An Australian DJ who travelled thousands of miles to meet a British schoolgirl after persuading her to film pornographic clips of herself and post them on the internet has been jailed. Lucius Lockyer, 41, flew from Sydney to meet the vulnerable youngster in Glasgow. He was jailed for ten months on Wednesday, but last night it emerged that he has already walked free from jail under Scotland's early release rules for offenders with shorter sentences. 'A sexual predator': Australian DJ Lucius Lockyer, who travelled 10,000 miles to meet a 14-year-old British girl after getting her to pose naked online . Lockyer had been chatting online to the 14-year-old – who cannot be named for legal reasons – for months before gradually talking her into making the images and uploading the pictures to adult websites where millions of people could view them. He was arrested by police acting on a tip-off before appearing at a Glasgow court in October last year. As well as his jail sentence a sheriff at Airdrie Sheriff Court also ordered to be placed on the sex offenders register for ten years after he admitted inciting a person under 18 to upload indecent images of herself on to pornographic websites. Last night, his victim told how Lockyer drew her into the dark world of internet pornography. She said: ‘lt started off innocently. The first few times he tried to talk to me I ignored him. ‘He told me he was 33 and I didn’t see the harm in talking to him as he didn’t even live in the same country as me. ‘He would tell me I was beautiful and clever and funny and we spoke every day. ‘Then we started sending pictures and videos to each other. But over time he would ask me to do this or do that. He started encouraging me to upload pictures and videos of myself on to adult sites.’ She added: ‘He told me he was coming to see me. ‘He called me and said he was in London and he would come and see me the next day in Glasgow. ‘It later came out what age he was and he was arrested.’ Depute fiscal Anne Hilley told Airdrie Sheriff Court: ‘They began conversations on Skype, which were private. ‘There . were several discussions and the accused sent several videos of himself . engaging in sexual acts and the complainer sent pictures of herself. ‘On analysis of Skype logs between January 2013 and April 2013, there are records of the accused occasionally encouraging the complainer to upload naked videos of herself on to a site and  he gave advice of how to do it anonymously.’ Defence lawyer Gary McAteer said: ‘The . court now has before it a full narrative into the case and a background . report on my client. ‘Key to that report and my submission is the risk assessment part. It states that he poses a low risk to the public. ‘He . has already spent five months in prison in custody and given that, and . what the reports say about a low risk, I would ask that the sentence . reflects that.’ Lockyer spent months chatting with the youngster every day on . Skype, during which told her she was 'funny and clever' before . persuading to pose naked in self-shot pornographic clips and post them . online . Sheriff Morag Galbraith sentenced Lockyer to ten months in prison, backdated five months to October last year. A . Crown Office spokesman said: ‘Lucius Loren Lockyer appeared on petition . at the Sheriff Court at Glasgow on October 9, 2013, charged with a . number of sexual offences. 'Following . full and careful consideration of all of the facts and circumstances in . this case, including the available evidence, Crown Counsel instructed . that the case should be heard at summary level. ‘This decision and the reasoning behind it was explained to the complainer.’ An outraged relative of the schoolgirl said: ‘He is a sexual predator. ‘I’m older and wiser and I know a 41-year-old man has nothing in common with a young girl. He took advantage of her.’ Out: Sheriff Morag Galbraith, sitting at Airdrie Sheriff Court, sentenced Lockyer to ten months in prison, backdated five months to October last year. The lenient sentence means he has already been released from jail . Last night, it emerged Lockyer has already been released from jail. Prisoners who receive a sentence of less than four years can be freed halfway through their term under early release rules. Sex offenders who are jailed for between six months and four years are also released but are kept on licence. They are liable to be recalled to custody for the remainder of their sentence if they breach their conditions. Last year, First Minister Alex Salmond said automatic early release was to be ended for prisoners who present the most serious potential risks to the public.","Lucius Lockyer, 41, would speak to the 14-year-old Glaswegian on Skype .

"By . Julian Robinson . America's largest student lender Sallie Mae has agreed to pay $60 million to service members for charging them excessive interest rates on their student loans. It means some 60,000 active-duty personnel could be in line for refunds having overpaid on their loans as far back as 2005. The deal settles a government lawsuit which alleged that the student loan giant violated the rights of service members by imposing interest rates above the six per cent permitted by federal law and by improperly seeking default judgments against them. Up to 60,000 US service members could be in line for refunds after Sallie Mae agreed to pay millions of dollars in fines . Meanwhile, in a separate case the company has also been ordered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to refund military members up to $30 million in late fees calculated on loans. The firm has also been slapped with a civil fine of $6.6 million. The lawsuit was the Justice Department's first against owners of student loans. Attorney General Eric Holder said: 'We are sending a clear message to all lenders and servicers who would deprive our service members of the basic benefits and protections to which they are entitled: this type of conduct is more than just inappropriate; it is inexcusable, and it will not be tolerated.' Attorney General Eric Holder has reached a $60 million settlement with the federal government to resolve allegations Sallie Mae charged military service members excessive interest rates on their student loans . Federal officials estimate that around 60,000 service members will be eligible for compensation as part of the settlement. An independent administrator will be assigned to distribute the reimbursements. The settlement has been filed in federal court in Delaware and is awaiting a judge's approval. As part of the deal, Sallie Mae would also be required to ask the three major credit bureaus to delete negative credit histories resulting from the overcharges. Education Secretary Arne Duncan, pictured, said students who have taken out loans 'should have the peace of mind' that borrowers will treat them fairly .

"By . Freya Noble . A Melbourne grandmother who allegedly bludgeoned her daughter-in-law to death with 33 strikes of a hammer was heard by a witness asking her grandson: 'How would you like to change your mother?' Huajiao Zhuang, 50, is accused of murdering Dan 'Selina' Lin, 21, because she wanted her to son re-marry a wealthier woman, a court has heard. Ms Zuhang is accused of beating her daughter-in-law 33 times with a hammer, before wrapping her body in a nylon bag, placing her body in a wheelie bin and then dumping the body in a creek. Grandmother Huajiao Zhuang allegedly killed her daughter-in-law after 33 blows to her head with a hammer . Prosecutor Peter Kidd told the Victorian Supreme Court that Zhuang wanted her son Rong Ping Zhuang, known as Peter, to divorce Ms Lin and marry a woman from China so he could earn 'hundreds of thousands of dollars' from the woman's family as he had Australian residency. He also alleged that Zhuang had an ongoing feud with Ms Lin over respect and about the care of her grandson, then aged two with witnesses testifying that Zhuang had previously slapped Ms Lin, attacked her in a car, and cut off some of her hair. Mr Kidd also said a school friend of Ms Lin once heard Zhuang ask her young grandson: 'How would you like to change your mother?' Ms Zhang's barrister said the she acted in self-defence, claiming that Ms Lin produced the hammer in a dispute over her child's bathwater. Deceased: Dan 'Selina' Lin, 21, was reportedly involved in ongoing disagreements with her mother-in-law, who allegedly wanted her son to marry a Chinese woman for financial gain . Mr Kidd said on the afternoon of the murder Zhang was driven to Ms Lin's Bundoora home to do some gardening. About 3pm on May 3, 2012, she beat Ms Lin repeatedly with a hammer in the bathroom, he said. A coroner found 33 separate injuries on Ms Lin's head, all inflicted with a hammer. All were inflicted with moderate force, Mr Kidd said, and a large, v-shaped wound on the back of Ms Lin's head was made with a number of downward blows. Ms Lin had a fractured nose and jaw, a chipped tooth and damage to a gum. Defensive injuries included bruising to the arm and a broken finger. The alleged murder took place in the bathroom, before Zhuang is accused of storing the body in a wheelie bin and later dumping it in a nearby creek . Zhuang put the body in a nylon bag, placed it in a wheelie bin and later that night returned to dump the body in a nearby creek, the court heard. Defence counsel Shane Gardner said his client did not deny inflicting the fatal injuries. 'Our defence is that it was the deceased that produced the hammer, it was the deceased that commenced an attack on my client, that my client was able to dispossess the deceased of the hammer and it's at that point that she caused the fatal injuries,' he said. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Court heard grandmother hammered daughter-in-law to death .

"By . Sarah Michael . and Freya Noble . The eldest son in the Lin family found dead in their Sydney home in 2009 looked up to and enjoyed practising badminton with the uncle accused of killing him, a court has heard. On Wednesday, Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie - who maintains his innocence - welled up as a friend of 12-year-old Henry Lin described how he talked about his 'uncle Robert' constantly on the internet chat program MSN. 'He talked about his uncle Robert a lot and talked in terms of respecting Robert's badminton ability ... and wanted to practise with uncle Robert as much as he would allow him?' Xie's barrister Graham Turnbull SC asked her. The Lin family of Sydney. The girl on the left is the only surviving family member. Her parents - Min 'Norman' Lin, 45, and Yun Li 'Lily' Lin, 43 - her brothers aged nine and 12, and an aunt, Yun Bin 'Irene' Yin, 39, were found dead in 2009 . 'Yes,' she replied in the NSW Supreme Court. The crown alleges Xie murdered newsagent Min Lin, 45 and his wife Lily, 44, her sister Irene, 39, and their two sons Henry and Terry, 9, at their Epping home, in Sydney's northwest, in the early hours of July 18, 2009. Neighbours say they heard unusual shouting the night before the battered bodies of the family were discovered, the court also heard. Prosecutors say Xie, driven by 'bitterness', turned off the electricity to the family home, crept into the house and slayed all five family members in their bedrooms using a 'hammer-like' weapon. Accused murderer Lian Bin Xie boards a police car at the King Street court in Sydney on Friday . The crown previously told the jury the killings were done with a 'minimum of noise' and that 'not one neighbour heard a single thing during the course of the murders'. As the Supreme Court trial continued on Wednesday, couple Pamela Burgess and Nigel Kelty, who lived near the Lins, said they remembered hearing shouting about 10.30pm on July 17, 2009. Ms Burgess said she and Mr Kelty were used to hearing yelling from their neighbours, who were 'arguing quite a lot' at that time. Detectives and forensic police examine the crime scene on Boundary Rd in North Epping Sunday on July 19, 2009 . But that night she said 'it wasn't the same as we were used to hearing, and that is why it was unusual. 'I don't actually know which direction it came from but it definitely wasn't next door,' Ms Burgess added. I don't know whether they were speaking English, I couldn't tell,' she added later. The trial continues.","Eldest son Henry admired accused uncle and played badminton with him .

"By . Sarah Michael . Wake Up host James Mathison apologised on TV on Thursday after the show set up a segment with pensioner Vilma Ward and Prime Minister Tony Abbott without disclosing her strong ties to the Labor Party. The 85-year-old gave Mr Abbott a massive serve about his government's budget on morning show Wake Up on Wednesday. But after Ms Ward's segment went viral it emerged she is a former ALP member and friend of Kevin Rudd and was selected by the show's producers. Scroll down for video . Wake Up host James Mathison (right) apologised after Network Ten set up a segment with a pensioner and Prime Minister Tony Abbott without disclosing her links to the Labor Party . 'A set of circumstances came about that meant that the perception might be that Vilma was set up to ambush Tony Abbott but that was never our intent and if that's the perception then we do apologise for that,' Mr Mathison said. 'Honesty and integrity are really important to [co-host] Natarsha [Belling] and I and we would never be involved in something that would be so deliberate and callous.' A Network Ten spokeswoman said producers were not aware of her links to the ALP before the show on Wednesday. 'Network Ten has reviewed the Wake Up segment in question,' she said. 'Wake Up should have known and disclosed Vilma Ward's links to the Labor Party.' Vilma Ward, 85, volunteered for Kevin Rudd's campaign the first time he ran for the seat of Griffith . Ms Ward appeared on the show again on Thursday and she said she was proud of working for Kevin Rudd but denied being a 'ALP stooge'. 'I really don’t know what my political feelings have got to do with me as an 85-year-old pensioner asking our prime minister questions,' she said. 'Is he such a delicate little flower that he can't answer these questions? 'For heaven's sake, if the prime minister can't take a little bit of criticism from an 85-year-old pensioner, God help us.' Ms Ward, from Norman Park in Kevin Rudd's former seat of Griffith, told MailOnline she had ties to the Labor party but said she was not an 'ALP plant'. 'Yes my husband [Leonard Edward] was the secretary of the Transport Workers Union,' she said. 'Yes I worked with Kevin Rudd on his very first campaign committee when he was standing for the seat of Griffith. Ms Ward attacked Tony Abbott and his changes to the pension on Network Ten's Wake Up on Wednesday morning . 'Yes I was a member of the Labor party then but I have a mind of my own and if I think black is black then black is black.' Wake Up executive producer Steve Wood told MailOnline on Wednesday that Ms Ward was selected by a Brisbane-based producer who remembered her from a segment she did for Channel Nine a decade ago. 'She was picked because she's good talent, not because of her political bias but because she's good talent,' he said. 'Because we knew she's a pensioner and we also knew she'd be good talent.' Mr Wood said Wake Up did not know she was a Labor voter when she was selected. But Network Ten publicist Heidi Packer said Ms Ward was selected to appear in the budget segment along with a family and a couple, and that the three groups were chosen because they were either Labor, Liberal or swing voters, to represent different sections of the voting public. The pensioner, from Norman Park in Brisbane, challenged the PM to visit pensioners and called him a 'comedian' Each group asked the Prime Minister a question live on air. 'We didn’t mention on air who they voted for,' she said. 'But we did interview them off air… we wanted it to be fair. 'The only reason why that [Vilma] clip went out was because it was the most heated.' Mr Wood said he had heard Mr Abbott’s office felt 'ambushed' by the segment but he disagreed. 'We look at it as being not an Opposition question but as a pensioner question. 'If the PM can't handle questions from a pensioner then he's got problems. 'Really if you look at it, he got in to power saying there would be no taxes, we get a person on today who said really at the end of the day ""You lied"". 'He's worried about what we do to him, what about what he's done to us.' 'At the end of the day all we’re after is good television and we got it.' Ms Ward said Mr Abbott's comments about government expenses made her 'cranky'. 'I'm one of these people, if I think people are talking garbage I will tell them,' she said. 'I don't know why we tend to put politicians on pedestals. 'They're accountable, they're workers, we put them there to do a job for us and as far as I'm concerned they'll damn well do it.' Mr Abbott was left momentarily speechless on live television on Wednesday morning after Ms Ward slammed him for the government's planned changes to the pension. 'Mr Prime Minster I have never heard of such rubbish in all my life,' Ms Ward told the PM on Network Ten's Wake Up. Mr Abbott, pictured in Canberra on Wednesday, was left stunned for a moment on TV when Ms Ward slammed his budget . 'Why don't you leave pensioners alone. If you pull the belt any tighter we'll choke to death.' Mr Abbott was left stunned for a moment, before telling Ms Ward: 'Well Vilma you've just given me a piece of your mind, and fair enough. 'That's your right in a democracy to be able to tell the prime minister exactly what you think of him.' In a statement to the MailOnline a spokeswoman for Mr Abbott said: 'The Prime Minister believes each Australian has the right in a democracy to be able to express exactly what they think of their politicians. 'The Prime Minister said during the interview that he suspected Ms Ward didn't vote for the Coalition during the election and said if she didn’t want to vote for the Coalition next time, that would be her right. Treasurer Joe Hockey delivered his first budget in the House of Representatives at Parliament House in Canberra on Tuesday night . 'The Prime Minister welcomes democratic debate and is always happy to engage in conversation.' The coalition has stuck to its pledge not to change the age pension in this term of government, but big changes are planned from 2017. Treasurer Joe Hockey insists the government is not cutting pension payments - they're just not going to increase as quickly as they do now. From late-2017 the indexed increases to the age pension will be linked to the consumer price index instead of the highest rate available, generally male average earnings. With inflation running at about 2.5 per cent pensioners will find their payments increasing by less than they've been used to in recent times.","James Mathison says sorry over Wake Up segment featuring Vilma Ward .

"By . Ap  Reporter . The man who famously put aside his Big Mac to help rescue three women held captive in a Cleveland house over a decade has signed a contract to publish his memoirs. Charles Ramsey signed the deal with the Cleveland publisher David Gray & Co. on Thursday. Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight and Berry's 6-year-old daughter escaped to freedom May 6. Collaborating as Ramsey's co-author will be freelance writer Randy Nyerges. Ariel Castro's neighbor Charles Ramsey speaks to media after helping Amanda Berry out of the Cleveland 'House of Horrors'. Ramsey, who has become something of an internet sensation because of his 'Dead Giveaway' YouTube videos, has now signed a book deal . Amanda Berry, seen here in her first interview since being rescued on May 6. Charles Ramsey rescued her from the home of Ariel Castro after hearing her screams and kicking in the door . A 10-foot chain link fence surrounds the home of Ariel Castro in Cleveland. Charles Ramsey, the man who lived next door to Castro and would go have BBQ at his house, heard Amanda Berry screaming and helped her out. He is now writing a book . The former U.S. Senate staff speechwriter co-wrote 'Day of the Dawg' with former Cleveland Browns defensive back Hanford Dixon. 'What you saw on TV doesn't even begin to tell the story,' Ramsey said in the company's announcement of the signing. Ramsey and Nyerges started work on the book early this month, David Gray said. Ramsey, who had been working as a dishwasher, is devoting full time to the project. 'Charles says outrageous things, but what a story he has,' Nyerges said. 'America doesn't know yet how truly brilliant this guy is.' The book, which does not yet have a title, will be published next spring. 'He's completely unfiltered,' Gray said. 'I think that's part of his appeal. He says what he thinks' Images and interviews with Charles Ramsey were seen across the country following the Cleveland 'House of Horrors' rescue . On the evening of September 3, 2013, one month into his life sentence, Ariel Castro (center) was found hanging by a bed sheet in his cell at the Correctional Reception Center in Orient, Ohio . 'I am really intrigued by him - as a person, with the story he had to tell, and with his ability to tell it.' Last May Ramsey, 44, heard screaming from Ariel Castro's Seymour Avenue house, which was next-door to his. Ramsey ran over, helped a woman who said she was Amanda Berry escape through the front door, and called 911. He was hailed as a hero, and his animated TV interviews, offering blunt opinions on race, class and life in the inner city, made him a sensation. Seeing a white girl in that situation was 'a dead giveaway' that she was either homeless or had other problems, he said. 'When a little pretty white girl ran into a black man's arms, something was wrong,' he said. FBI agents search the home where three Cleveland women were found alive after vanishing in Cleveland, Ohio. The women were reunited with their families on after being missing for about a decade . Viking announced last week that it has acquired a planned book by Berry and DeJesus. The book is currently untitled and is scheduled to come out in 2015. Knight is working on her own memoir, which Weinstein Books plans to publish next spring. Castro was arrested and eventually sentenced to life in prison. He was found hanged in his cell in September.","Charles Ramsey, a neighbor of Ariel Castro in Cleveland, Ohio, was eating McDonald's on May 6 when he heard the screams of a woman .

"By . Hugo Gye . Renting a home is now significantly cheaper than buying one thanks to the non-stop house price boom, with the gap growing over recent months. For every £1 spent by a homeowner on repaying the mortgage, a renter in an equivalent property pays just 93p, according to new figures. Just one year ago, renters were paying only four per cent less than homeowners, but as house prices have continued to soar buying a home has become increasingly unaffordable. Boom: House prices have risen by around 11 per cent in the past year, making home ownership unaffordable . The price of the average home in the UK has risen by 11 per cent over the past year, to a new high of £260,000. By contrast, the cost of renting rose by 3.7 per cent in the year to April, according to figures from property firm Countrywide. More... New loan checks cause 20% fall in mortgages: More borrowers being rejected since stricter vetting introduced . Compare the best buy mortgage rates and get free professional advice . Across the nation, the average monthly rent stands at £873, up from £837 a year ago. The company says that for every £1 of mortgage repayments by a homeowner with a 10 per cent deposit, the average renter has to pay only 93p. That gap is even wider in London, epicentre of the housing boom, where renters pay just 86p compared to mortgage repayments. Regional variation: This map shows how renting is better value in the South of England and the Midlands than in the North-East, Wales and Scotland . Renting is now cheaper than buying in all but three of the capital's 33 boroughs, as areas such as Hackney, Tower Hamlets and Croydon have become increasingly fashionable with buyers. The gap between renting and buying has widened in all parts of the UK bar South Wales and North-East England, where house prices have fallen in recent months. Other data support Countrywide's figures - statistics compiled by The Economist suggest that British house prices are overvalued by more than 30 per cent in comparison to rents. Unlike other countries such as the U.S., where house prices collapsed in the wake of the financial crisis, the UK's housing market has remained relatively strong, thanks partly to demand for prime central London property from the world's super-rich. However, tough new rules on mortgage eligibility could see a fall in lending which could bring the five-year boom to an end. Housing ladder: Renting is now considerably cheaper than owning your own home, according to new data . 'Home ownership has long been part of the British psyche,' said Nick Dunning of Countrywide. 'However, for many households, particularly in the short to medium term, home ownership doesn't always make sense financially or otherwise. 'As house prices rise, renting increasingly allows people to live in areas they would otherwise be unable to afford to buy. In more expensive cities, such as London, the cost of renting in more central areas can be just half the cost of buying.' He added: #While in the long term capital repayments will mean that homeowners build up equity in their property, in the shorter term, purchase costs such as stamp duty and the ongoing costs of maintenance can mean the cost of homeownership is considerably higher than renting. 'In the first year of ownership, taking into account all associated costs, a buyer with a 10 per cent deposit will pay 35 per cent more than someone renting the equivalent property.'","Renters pay just 93p for every £1 spent on mortgage repayments .
