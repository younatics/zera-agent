Dressed in a pair of tight white jeans and a black tank top the early stages of her pregnancy could be seen –perhaps a deliberate move from Lauren who knew the whole world would be watching. Opting for comfort she wore a pair of white sandals while she carried a large white back and a straw hat to protect her from the sun. Her dark hair looked as glossy as ever falling around her shoulders and she kept her eyes covered with a pair of sunglasses.

Domenico Rancadore, 64, is wanted in Italy to serve a seven-year jail term for his role in the criminal underworld. The mafia boss who fled to Britain in 1995, a chauffeur with a host of celebrity and business . clients, was arrested in his semi-detached bungalow he shares with his wife in Uxbridge, west London, earlier this month. Dubbed 'The Professor', he is reputed to have been the 'capo' - or boss - of the Cosa Nostra in the criminal heartland of Trabia, Sicily. Rancadore was denied bail for a second time at Westminster Magistrates’ Court . today after Prosecutor Aaron Watkins said there were 'overwhelming . grounds' to suspect he would go on the run if he was released. Mr . Watkins said it was 'telling' that the former teacher, who was living . under the assumed name Marc Skinner, had expressed his unwillingness to . return to Italy to uniformed police officers. Rancadore . wore a rugby shirt and clutched a white Bible as a female interpreter . translated District Judge Quentin Purdy’s rejection of his request for . bail. He shook his head and exchanged glances with English wife Anne Skinner, who sat in the public gallery.

Acknowledging . that his client had been living under an assumed name, which he has used . to get treatment from the NHS, he said: 'His case is that he has used . the name of Skinner because he has no trust in the Italian legal . authorities.'

The water didn’t taste quite so salty as it did a while ago and the fish he was chasing looked distinctly unfamiliar. So what was a maverick dolphin expected to do but leap out of the water and take a look around? Scroll down for video . Rare sight: This dolphin was spotted swimming up the river Dee in North Wales on Monday . Hungry: The young dolphin has swum 30 miles chasing fish up the river to within half a mile of the city centre . Ah yes. Here we are. Chester . racecourse, about half a mile from the city centre and 20 miles from the . open sea. Not quite the kind of place you’d expect to see a . short-beaked common dolphin, perhaps – even one that’s decided to take a . city break. But just for . the moment, Dave the River Dee dolphin clearly likes it here on the . border between England and Wales, entertaining spectators with leaping, . clicking and flipping and displays just yards from a riverside walkway . and cycle track. Startled . passers-by tweeted photographs of the show-off performance when Dave was . first spotted on Monday evening just west of the Welsh border, which . runs north to south across the river. He . stayed overnight and was seen again at various points on Tuesday, at . one stage reaching a weir that is in sight of the ancient city walls. Yesterday – after apparently heading out towards the Irish Sea – he was  back again. ‘I . don’t think it can decide whether to stay in England or Wales,’ said . Stephen Marsh, operations director for the British Divers Marine Life . Rescue charity, which is monitoring Dave’s travels. ‘We want to make sure it doesn’t get into trouble or become stranded on a bank, but at the moment it seems quite happy. ‘Unless it gets into difficulty we don’t need to intervene.’ The Dee Rivermonster: The dolphin has already earned himself several nicknames since he was first spotted . Dave, . whose more normal habitat is the deep water of the Bay of Biscay or . Irish Sea, is believed to have broken away from a pod to chase or search . for fish to eat. It . appears he swam into  the mouth of the Dee estuary from Liverpool Bay, . then into the comparatively narrow stretch of river that runs between . Chester and Connah’s Quay. Onlookers . saw him frolicking  in the tidal waters and heard his distinctive . ‘clicking’ noise as he swam near the weir and leapt into the air. ‘Nobody . really knows for certain why they do that,’ Mr Marsh said. ‘He might . have been having a quick look round to see where he was, maybe looking . for his family or his prey … or sometimes it might just be a jump for . joy.’ Experts suspect low . tide might have taken Dave by surprise –  and that the current high . spring tide, which dramatically increases the river’s current, probably . prevented him from heading back out to sea. Watchful eye: A conservation group is keeping tabs on the dolphin to make sure it does not come to any harm . Rescue: Despite efforts to save the Langstone bottlenose, it had to be put down . In 2006 a Northern Bottlenose whale captured the hearts of the British public and made headlines around the world when it swam up the River Thames in the depths of winter. Scientists believed the six-metre long female had got lost and was trying to head west towards the deep waters of the north Atlantic when it became stranded. She had not been able to feed for three days after swimming into the river and became severely dehydrated. Despite a rescue operation, the sea mammal, a young adult, died as she was being taken back out to sea on a barge. In 2008 an eight-metre whale weighing nine stone beached itself on a mudflat in Langstone Harbour, Hampshire. The whale, which was also a Northern Bottlenose, was put down by lethal injection after suffering kidney failure. Yesterday a study conducted by the Zoological Society of London announced 708 seals had been spotted in the Thames Estuary in the first ever count by air, sea and land in which numerous volunteers and conservationists took part. Although it is positive news for the south of the England, in Scotland numbers of the harbour seal have declined sharply for unknown reasons. Although . common dolphins  can swim at more than 35mph  and can maintain high . speeds  for hours, they are deep water mammals and are unused to such . powerful fluctuations. Short-beaked . common dolphins can weigh 440lb and grow up to  9ft long. Most live an . average of 17 years but some have reportedly survived to 50. It . is likely Dave will find a way out (or that he simply decides to cancel . his holiday) but coastguards have put a lifeboat on standby to aid his . passage. Should he become stranded, boat crews and animal welfare teams will hoist him from the water and return him to the deep. Last . night a watch was being maintained to ensure he didn’t leap the weir . and head farther upriver – although he might  struggle a bit if he got . as far  as its source in Snowdonia, someone observed. Conservation . worker Tom McGovern, who has helped a long-running clean-up initiative . for the river, said: ‘Over the past three or four years we have got rid . of over a thousand sacks of rubbish. ‘It’s a good job we’ve done  that, or he would have been swimming around with a plastic bag on his head!’ Playful: The dolphin has seemed quite undeterred by his unfamiliar surroundings .","Dolphin undeterred by unfamiliar surroundings as he swam in to Chester .

The cost of the controversial High Speed 2 rail line could reach £73billion, senior Treasury officials have warned ministers. In a sign of the growing opposition to the project within parts of the Treasury, officials have stopped using the latest £42.6billion estimate in favour of the higher figure. Some believe the cost of the flagship project is out of control and are warning that it cannot be justified. Controversial: The cost of the high-speed rail line HS2 is likely to be near £73billion, say Treasury officials . A source close to George Osborne insisted that the Coalition remained fully committed to the project to build a high speed line between London, Birmingham and the north of England. The source said the Chancellor believed HS2 was a ‘crucial project for our future prosperity and growth’ and was determined to overrule Treasury scepticism. The source suggested some elements in the Treasury had an ingrained opposition to major infrastructure projects. But the revelation that parts of the Treasury are actively lobbying against the scheme will reinforce doubts about whether it will go ahead. The official budget has already . rocketed from £30billion in 2010 to £42.6billion. Now, in a break with . normal practice, Treasury officials are adding VAT and inflation to . produce £73billion. One . official told the Financial Times that this figure – 70 per cent higher . than the official estimate – was being used deliberately to encourage . opposition to the scheme within government. Opposition: A source close to George Osborne said the Chancellor is determined to build the rail line despite criticism . Investment: The revelation that Treasury insiders are against HS2 will reinforce doubts over whether it will go ahead . Some Treasury insiders believe the money would be better spent on smaller projects which could deliver more economic growth more quickly. Many independent experts believe the HS2 bill will be even higher. The Institute for Economic Affairs estimates that it could reach £80billion. There are also signs that the cross-party consensus behind the scheme is beginning to crumble. Former business secretary Lord Mandelson, once an enthusiastic advocate, warned last month that it could prove an ‘expensive mistake’. Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance campaign group, welcomed Treasury opposition to the scheme and called for it to be axed. He said: ‘The economic case for HS2 simply isn’t credible and it’s ridiculous that ministers aren’t being honest about the cost of this white elephant.’","Officials have stopped using £42.6billion estimate in favour of higher figure .

Hawthorn had also failed to pay income tax or national insurance contributions from his on-stage earnings as alter-ego 'Tilly' In total, he fraudulently claimed £84,534 and admitted two further counts of knowingly and fraudulently evading national insurance payments and income tax to the tune of £3,759 .

An IRA militant is on the run from Italian police after they cracked an alleged money laundering scheme linked to mafia gangs today. A European arrest warrant has been issued for Henry James Fitzsimons, 63, a convicted terrorist from Belfast, after 20 alleged members of a criminal gang were arrested and assets worth £390million during the operation. He is accused of conspiring with the 'Ndrangheta mafia to launder drug-trafficking money by investing in luxury properties along the Calabrian coast of southern Italy. The IRA allegedly sent Fitzsimons to . launder drug-trafficking profits with the help of the Italian mafia gang . 'Ndrangheta, according to the news agency AGI. Fitzsimons had invested around 12 . million Euros with the Italian mafia and a group of Spanish . entrepreneurs to build resorts and luxury residences on some of the most . beautiful, undeveloped beaches of Calabria, police said. After serving eight years for . terrorism, Fitzsimons had reinvented himself as an entrepreneur. His . role was to promote the properties in Britain and Ireland and advise . potential customers. The money he invested in the . construction of a resort called  ‘Gioiello del Mare ‘ or Jewel of the .

His membership of the IRA was ascertained by wiretapped phone conversations, the arrest warrant said. The Irish separatist group allegedly first contacted the 'Ndrangheta mafia branch, based in Calabria, as far back as 2007. The IRA has previously been known to launder money through organised criminal gangs in Spain. Colonel Claudio Pettrozziello said: 'We know from the terminology he used that the money originated from crime. 'We can't prove it was IRA money but we know he still had strong links to the organisation. 'We are still hoping to catch . Fitzsimons. We have issued the warrant for his arrest but he has already . fled Europe, beyond our jurisdiction.' he said. He added: 'He knew he was involved with the mafia and we believe he himself had reason to fear for his life.' The 'Ndrangheta, whose name means 'virtue' in a dialect of ancient Greek, originally made their money from kidnappings and extortion. But they have now expanded into the drugs and property from which their huge profits are invested in northern Europe. Police seized 12 companies and 17 tourist complexes in Calabria where the 'Ndrangheta had allegedly invested illicit money. The investigation was led by veteran anti-Mafia prosecutor Nicola Gratteri who says the ‘Ndrangheta has evolved into an extensive business network reinvesting the profits from narcotics, arms trafficking and other sources estimated at ten of billions of euros a year. 'This is a new ‘Ndrangheta entrepreneurship, a new way of ‘doing Mafia’ where there is no shooting or killing, but where affiliation derives only from one matrix: money,' the finance police statement said according to the Financial Times.","Convicted IRA terrorist Henry James Fitzsimons, 63, wanted in Italy .

A former prisoner has justified her £20,000 sex change by claiming the NHS wastes money on cancer sufferers. Jasmine Goode, 37, formerly known as Darren, was born in Rhyl, North Wales, with both male and female genitals and was raised as a girl called Sarah-Jane until she was eight. Then she said she was encouraged by her parents to live as a boy called Darren and says she felt pressured to be 'macho' by her father. Former burglar Jasmine Goode, previously known as Darren, has had a £20,000 sex change on the NHS . As a result of this gender confusion, she claims she started hanging around with a bad element and took her first steps into a life of crime to try and appear more macho. In 1994, aged 18, she was jailed for burglary for the first time. She spent the next few years in and out of prison until May 2006 when, while serving an 11-year stretch for a string of burglaries, she told a prison nurse she was transex and wanted to live a new life as a woman. Since then the NHS has spent £20,000 on sex change operations and treatments for Jasmine. Before: As Darren Goode, who served a number of prison sentences for burglary . She said: 'The NHS wastes money helping people with cancer, often smokers, even though their condition is terminal and they are going to die whereas I've got years left.' Jasmine told The Sun her condition was as 'life-threatening as cancer' because of high suicide rates among the transgender community, adding that giving him the treatment was cost-effective as she would otherwise be too depressed to work and instead claim benefits. Jasmine, who works for a charity that helped her with the sex change, has a 16-year-old son from one relationship and two children from a marriage to a different woman, who are now nine and 10. When she - then a he - was alone with his eldest son, she would pretend to be the child's mother and wore her girlfriend's clothes. She no longer sees her children. After the breakdown of the marriage and she was moved to an open prison, Jasmine applied to the NHS for cash for gender reassignment. Hormone tablets made her grow breasts, a charity donated women's clothes and make up and £18,000 from the NHS paid for electrolysis and laser treatment to remove body hair, followed by surgery to transform her genitals. Although the NHS refused to pay for breast enhancement, she has since had surgery to gain a 36E chest - claiming her sex life has 'gone wild' since the op. She said: 'People might be angry, but I had a condition that needed treating. 'I feel awful about my criminal past and I'm so sorry to those I hurt during that time. I'd never step on the wrong side of the law again - I'm living the dream.' An NHS England spokesperson said: 'It is up to the NHS locally to decide what treatments to provide and all decisions made about gender identity services are based on an individual clinical assessment. 'Prisoners have the right to receive the same range and quality of NHS treatments and services as anyone else, including gender identity services.'","Jasmine, previously Darren, underwent surgery after prison .

Peter Mayne, 41, was mauled by the half ton beast after joining in the ancient tradition of bull running in small village near the popular resort of Benidorm. The former soldier needed 150 stitches and staples to help close gaping wounds in his leg and torso which were caused when the bull rammed him into railings. Scroll down for video (graphic content) Gouged: British holidaymaker Peter Mayne is mauled by a bull during a Spanish festival near Benidorm . A horrifying video of the freak accident at Bous al Carrer festival has been viewed by thousands of people on You Tube. Tube worker Mr Mayne jetted off to Benidorm with his wife Mandy, 43, and step-daughter Hannah Chamberlain, 18. Mr Mayne, 41, needed 150 stitches and staples to help close gaping wounds in his leg and torso . The family had always planned to attend the festival in the small village of Calpe which sees bulls let loose and run through the streets. Mr Mayne was posing for photos as his family waited for the bulls to tear past them - but within moments tragedy struck. One of the powerful beasts came hurtling towards Mr Mayne and threw him into the air as hundreds of spectators watched on. The Briton, who was wearing a bright pink shirt which may have enraged the animal, desperately clung onto its horns but was soon crushed up against a row of metal railings. In the video footage a spanish local can be seen pulling on the animal's tail in a bid to save Mr Mayne, who was eventually pulled by his legs back into the concerned crowd. The half-ton animal was soon pacified leaving Mr Mayne's terrified family to call for the Spanish emergency services. Mr Mayne, from Herne Bay, Kent, was taken to a nearby hospital where he remains, too fragile to be transported back to the UK. The couple spent their 13th wedding anniversary last week in Calpe. His concerned step-daughter Hannah, who flew home after the accident on August 6, yesterday relived the terrifying ordeal.

The New York City Police Department announced it's largest gun seizure in city history today - showing off some of the 254 weapons obtained in their 10 month investigation at a press conference. The weapons bust which has led to 19 indictments wouldn't have been possible without the aid of social media. Initially the department was investigating drug charges on aspiring Brooklyn rapper Matthew Best after he started posting photos on Instagram and videos on YouTube flaunting his guns and big bills. Wiretapping of Best led investigators to two men in the Carolinas who were smuggling guns separately but using the same middleman in New York City. Scroll down for video . Off the streets: NYPD commission Ray Kelly with Mayor Michael Bloomberg, announcing the gun bust Monday . Variety: The guns seized ranged in size from small handguns to larger shotguns and assault weapons . Walter Walker and Earl Campbell sourced guns from suppliers in their hometowns of Sanford, North Carolina and Rock Hill, South Carolina and sold them on the black market in New York. When the NYPD found out about the illegal business, they sent an undercover officer posing as a gun broker to buy the weapons off the two men. The smugglers would take pictures of the guns they were offering and send it to the undercover officer. They would then transport the guns into the city, using cheap Chinatown buses to avoid attracting attention or having their bags checked by security. Apparently the city's stop-and-frisk policy was a concern for the smugglers. Commission Ray Kelly read from one wiretap where a gun distributor alluded to the controversial search: 'Yeah, I’m in Charlotte now, I can’t take them to my town…we got like whatchamacallit, stop-and-frisk.' The fares on these buses are about half that charged by Greyhound, which, unlike the Chinatown buses, requires identification for boarding. Taken: In total, the NYPD seized 254 weapons and have indicted 19 people in the illegal gun ring . No more business: The bust led the indictment of 19 people. Above, rapper Matthew best is pictured with the offenders from New York . Breaking the law: Earl Campbell pictured at the top of those involved in the ring in South Carolina . Smugglers: Walter Walker, top, with the North Carolina crew . Walker met two times last year with the middleman and the undercover officer at the rapper's Brooklyn recording studio to sell the undercover firearms, the indictment said. He also allegedly sold weapons to the undercover officer in April in Manhattan. In January, Campbell's girlfriend transported a disassembled gun in a zebra-striped suitcase. When they arrived in New York she proceeded to take the weapon parts out of the bag and assemble them in the back of a car watching a YouTube tutorial for guidance. When she couldn't figure out how to put the weapon together, the undercover cop bought the pieces anyway for $1,100. Conspicuous: Campbell's 22-year-old girlfriend packed an SKS semi-automatic weapon in a zebra-striped suitcase . Walker and Campbell were arrested earlier this month by local police in their home states, authorities said. The names of their defense attorneys were not immediately available. New York has some of the nation's strictest gun-control measures and a mayor who has crusaded for tougher laws in other states. 'There is no doubt that the seizure of these guns has saved lives,' Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a news conference.

Accidental death: Surranna Stonestreet died in May after she was hit by a falling wall from a shed her father was dismantling . A four-year-old was killed when a garden shed her father was dismantling collapsed and fell on her, an inquest heard. Surranna Stonestreet, from Bath, Somerset, suffered fatal head injuries when she was hit by six breeze blocks that crashed down from the six-foot high wall. Father Karl Stonestreet looked round to find his daughter laying under six breeze blocks with blood pouring from her mouth. He thought she'd been playing on a tampoline nearby. He scooped up his daughter and ran into the house screaming at friends to call an ambulance but she died later in hospital. In a statement read to the hearing, Mr Stonestreet said he intended to take down and rebuild the shed, built by his brother-in-law, as the front wall was not straight. He said: 'The chisel got stuck by the door of the breeze block wall. 'At that point that wall suddenly fell towards me.' Mr Stonestreet said he stepped backwards to avoid the falling rubble and fell over. 'As I got up I could see that Surranna was lying to the side of me. 'She had six breeze blocks on her chest. She had blood coming from her mouth.' Mr Stonestreet picked up his daughter and rushed her inside the house, where wife Nicola, a full-time mother, administered CPR. Tragic: Police described Surranna's death as a 'tragic accident'. Flowers were left in the garden where the four-year-old was killed . 'When Nicky was working on Surranna she did begin to take some breaths,' he added. Paramedics . arrived five minutes later and took Surranna to Bath's Royal United . Hospital (RUH), where she was pronounced dead at 4.35pm. The inquest was told Surranna's uncle, John Copp, a self-employed ground worker, built the wall in March 2011. Mr . Copp said the wall was six feet high and 10 feet long and comprised of a . breeze block front, asbestos sides and a corrugated metal roof. 'As far as I am concerned I built a solid structure and that was how I left it,' Mr Copp said. 'At Christmas 2012 my brother told me the shed I built had the roof taken off and was a skeleton. 'In my opinion, this would have made the shed unstable. Surranna's father was planning to dismantle and then rebuild the back-garden shed at their family home . 'I have been devastated by the death of my niece Surranna.' Mr Copp said the Stonestreet family moved from Bridgend in Wales to the semi-detached home in October 2012. Detective Sergeant Birt, of Avon and Somerset Police told the inquest at Flax Bourton Coroner's Court: 'During this investigation I have not found any concerning or suspicious circumstances. 'This would appear to be a tragic accident.' Maria Voisin, Coroner for Avon, concluded that Surranna - whose family did not attend the inquest - had died an 'accidental death' on May 3. She extended her condolences to the family who were not present at the inquest. After the tragedy, Mrs Stonestreet paid tribute to her daughter on a Facebook page called 'Nicola & Surranna Stonestreet'. Mrs Stonestreet wrote: 'R.I.P baby ur going to be sooooo missed u were my world.

The ratings grab by ABC comes months after the network's morning show beat The Today Show for the first time in 16 years. Though the battle between Good Morning America and The Today Show has involved a well-documented round of musical chairs among the Today Show, the evening news win marks a big win for Diane Sawyer. Big win: ABC's World News hosted by Diane Sawyer beat the NBC counterpart in the ratings race twice last week . Reason to smile: ABC's morning program Good Morning America had a major coup when they beat The Today Show in April 2012 for the first time in 16 years . The journalist has anchored ABC's World News since 2009 and the show's ratings last week were just reported today. During the week of July 14, ABC won the ratings race among viewers aged 25 to 54 years old on both Monday and Tuesday. ABC took 2.009 million viewers to NBC's 1.972 million on Monday and continued their streak by pulling 1.891 million on Tuesday as compared to NBC's 1.820 million that same evening. That said, NBC Nightly News still 'won' the 25-54 demographic, which is coveted among advertisers, on average for the week. Deadline reports that this was the first time that ABC's evening news program beat its NBC counterpart in three years and 10 months. Losing ground: Savannah Guthrie was brought on to the Today Show after they lost to GMA for the first time in 16 years (left), and World News competes against Brian Williams' NBC Nightly News (right) Aside from being a point of pride for Sawyer, the boost in the networks ratings is a massive sales factor for ABC's advertising team. While this past week gave two tangible dates of record-breaking ratings, it has been a growing trend. ABC World News has cut the average gap that separated them from NBC by double digits for the past five weeks. That gap was cut by a whopping 40 per cent last week, Deadline reports. One play that ABC is making in an effort to keep the rates up is to go heavy on their detailed coverage of the birth of the Royal baby. Both NBC and ABC have cut into their regularly scheduled programming throughout Monday and Tuesday, and they will air competing special programs on Tuesday night.","ABC World News won the ratings fight over the coveted 25-54 year old demographic of viewers twice in one week .

But yesterday business leaders and even senior Labour MPs lined up to agree that many teenagers have been left ill-equipped for the job market. Validated: Mr Hurd's comments caused controversy on Tuesday but he has since been proven right as business leaders rush to confirm his theories . Neil Carberry, a director at the CBI, said: ‘What employers tell us is very much around grit, tenacity, self-determination to get on with colleagues, which is what Nick Hurd is talking about. ‘The Government has rightly pushed for more rigorous exams, but there is also space in the curriculum for character skills. Head teachers are only judged on their GCSE results, but I think all-round attitude and aptitude need to be taken into account.’ Mike Cherry, policy chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses, said a survey of their members found that more than 60 per cent are not confident they can find the right young person to fill a job. Mr Cherry added: ‘I think he [Mr Hurd] highlights the issue and the Government has to look hard at how to deal with it. 'They [employers] need young people with numeracy, literacy but also employability skills, including soft skills, right down to how to dress properly and what to do and say when they turn up.’ From yesterday's Mail . Mr Hurd, an Old Etonian and . fourth-generation Tory MP, was criticised yesterday by Labour’s work and . pensions spokesman Liam Byrne who said he was ‘out of touch’ and should . come and meet ‘angry young people’ in his Birmingham constituency. Teresa Pearce, a Labour MP on the Commons work and pensions select committee, said: ‘Although I can agree with the point I think he is trying to make ... it is clumsily put by him and more than a little insensitive for an old Etonian whose CV reads more like an entry in Who’s Who than a list of real-life work experience.’ Mr Hurd, the Minister for Civil Society, had said: ‘What we see in survey after survey is employers saying qualifications are important but that just as important to us are so-called soft skills, character skills, the ability to get on with different people, to articulate yourself clearly, confidence, grit, self-control, and they are saying we are not seeing enough of this in kids coming out of schools.’ Mr Hurd, whose department is in charge of the National Citizen Service which helps young people develop these skills, took to Twitter to defend his remarks, saying he was not criticising teenagers. He wrote: ‘It is employers raising concerns about how work-ready many young people are.’ Labour’s Tristram Hunt, a shadow education minister, said he agreed entirely with Mr Hurd’s comments about ‘grit’. ‘It’s the right message but the tragedy is the Government have allowed services such as youth clubs, which are shown to improve employability, to wither on the vine.’","Etonian Nick Hurd was criticised yesterday for being 'out of touch'

A summer of hot weather at home has given the UK economy a welcome boost and more warm temperature this weekend will help generate a further £1billion, according to VisitEngland. Hundreds of enthusiastic music fans began pouring into the Reading Festival site today long before doors even opened for ‘early-bird’ campers. The event, set to attract 90,000 fans a day, gets underway on Friday when American rock legends Green Day are set to headline the main stage. Forecasters have predicted largely dry and sunny weather for the area, meaning music fans may escape the customary festival mudbath. Around 4.5million people are planning to take a holiday in the UK involving an overnight stay, and a further 1.8million are going overseas. But 7.5million remain undecided about whether to stay home or make a trip and will make a decision based on how the weather turns out. Those staying at home will be able to take advantage of the lifting of some English roadworks on major routes, although restrictions will remain in place at some busy spots.

Other areas may get showers or longer periods of rain. Motoring and traffic organisations forecast that Friday will be the busiest day on the roads, with the AA reckoning as many as 16 million drivers will be out over the holiday period.

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 05:32 EST, 22 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:32 EST, 22 August 2013 . A failed asylum seeker who came to Britain unable to speak English has secured a place at Oxford - but now worries that his whole family could be deported to Afghanistan. Muhammad Abdul Ghani achieved outstanding grades in his A-levels after just two years of living in the country. However, since his family's asylum request was rejected, he faces the prospect of being kicked out of Britain. Success: Muhammad Abdul Ghani has secured a place at Oxford two years after moving to Britain from Syria . Muhammad, 18, is of Afghan descent but was born in Iran and grew up in Syria - which is now being torn apart in a brutal civil war. In February 2011, he came to Britain with his mother Zohra, 17-year-old brother Ammar and sister Fatema, seven. The family settled in Oldham, and Muhammad started studying for his A-levels at Oldham Sixth Form College. Despite the language barrier, he was quickly able to excel, especially in the sciences. Last week he received his A-level results, learning that he had achieved an A* in maths and A in chemistry and physics. Nightmare: The 18-year-old's family faces being deported after their asylum claim was rejected . 'If this was two years ago I would have said getting these results was impossible,' he said. 'It's been really surprising. 'I didn't speak a word of English and it was really hard work, especially in the first year. I found it difficult to understand the teachers, so I used to bring a tape recorder to all my lessons to play it back afterwards. 'My grades could've been much better if I had better English but I'm really pleased with them.' He was awarded a place to study physics at Wadham College, Oxford, whose alumni include Christopher Wren, Michael Foot and Rowan Williams. The family had applied to stay in Britain, claiming that they would be in danger if forced to return to Afghanistan or Syria. But the asylum claim was turned down, meaning they will be deported if they do not leave voluntarily. Prestigious: Muhammad is now hoping to study physics at Wadham College, Oxford . 'There's a fear that they will send us back and it's just not fair,' Muhammad said. 'This is my home now. 'If we go back our lives are at risk. I still have friends in Afghanistan and Syria but they fight to stay alive every day.' The family is currently planning to lodge an appeal against the Home Office decision. If they are forced to leave Britain, Muhammad will be able to apply for a student visa in order to take up his studies at Oxford. A spokesman for the Home Office declined to comment, saying the body does not discuss individual cases. His plight is similar to that of Najibullah Hashimi, who was deported to Afghanistan earlier this year despite building a new life in Britain. The 18-year-old had achieved 13 GCSEs and was considered a pillar of his community, captaining the school cricket team and mentoring other Afghan youths. But he was forced to return to Afghanistan, which he had fled aged 11 after his father was murdered by the Taliban.","Muhammad Abdul Ghani, 18, left war-torn Syria for the UK in 2011 .

A barman and promising hockey player died after crashing his BMW just six weeks after his mother bought him the car because she thought it was safer than him cycling to work, an inquest heard. Thomas Chevins, 23, was killed instantly when his new vehicle left the A53 near Market Drayton, Shropshire, in wet conditions and struck a tree at 1am on December 28 last year. An inquest heard his mother Heather Chevin, 46, had only recently purchased the red BMW 3-series for her son because she was worried for his safety as he travelled to and from work on his bike. Tragic: Thomas Chevins who died after crashing the BMW that his mother had bought for him because she worried for his safety whilst he was using his bike . Before owning the £30,000 car Mr Chevins had been cycling 11 miles from his home in Market Drayton to Eccleshall, Staffordshire, where he worked as a barman at The Royal Oak. Stoke-on-Trent Coroners Court heard the University of York graduate lost control as he travelled home from work a month after being given the vehicle. Coroner Ian Smith on Monday said: 'Mr Chevins died from multiple injuries including a ruptured liver. 'He was driving along the A53 in his motorcar towards Market Drayton. As he approached a left-hand bend he failed to negotiate the bend and the vehicle left the road colliding with a tree in the hedgerow. 'He sustained fatal injuries and was certified dead at the scene. Barman Mr Chevins died when he lost control on the A53 when driving from work in Eccleshall, Staffordshire to his home in Market Drayton, Shropshire . 'The road was unlit, it was raining at . the time, the road surface was wet, and the vehicle had one defective . tyre and two others with limited tread.' Crash investigator Nigel Power, from West Midlands Police, told the coroner Mr Chevins was likely to have lost control of his car and . then overcompensated with the steering wheel, forcing the vehicle to . skid sideways up a hedge and into a tree. Pc Power added that the national speed limit of 60mph may not have been suitable in those conditions. He . said he was also an inexperienced driver, who had only owned his rear . wheel drive car for 42 days, after he had been used to driving a front . wheel drive vehicle. Mr Chevins, who was a keen hockey player for Market Drayton Town, was on a traineeship with Joule’s Brewery when he died. The . inquest heard he had a promising future in the sport and pub trade and . was expected to move into a management role in Market Drayton. Speaking after his death, Mr Chevins’ family described him as an 'intelligent and handsome young man'. Thomas Chevins' mother Heather, 46, had only recently purchased a BMW 3-series, similar to this one, for her son because she was worried for his safety cycling to work . A statement from parents Mike, 46, and Heather and three younger brothers, Jordan 20, Alfie 15 and Harry 13, said: 'He was an intelligent and handsome young man who lived life to the full. 'His passions included writing novels and playing hockey. 'He captained his university team to victory in 2011 and on his return to Market Drayton threw himself into the local hockey club, where he started up, and captained the third XI with a great youth policy. 'He had recently taken the first steps on the ladder to the career he loved. 'He will be sorely missed.' Chrissie Nutall, managing director of Joule’s Brewery, also paid tribute adding: 'Thomas was a real pleasure to work with, he had an ability to light up and room and had an infections quality of joy which made him really good company. 'To work with he was willing to take responsibility and step and take ownership. 'When we are looking for people to work with that is an unusual quality.

Turner and Tracy White falsified accident and emergency discharge times . to avoid missing a government goal for patients to be dealt with within . four hours. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) also found that nurse Sharon Turner used foul mouthed language about patients and threatened to make her colleague’s life 'hell'. She also made racially-motivated comments about doctors at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust and falsified A&E waiting times data, the nursing regulator found. Disgraced: Sharon Turner, right, a nurse at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital used foul mouthed language about patients and threatened to make her colleague’s life 'hell'. Tracy White, left, was found to have changed patient records so it would appear her  department was meeting waiting time targets . Between December 2003 and October 2009, . when Ms Turner worked at the trust, she spoke about patients and staff . in an 'inappropriate manner', the NMC panel ruled. On one occasion she said that she didn’t give a 'flying f***” about patients. She also said 'they can f****** wait' and 'they want to get real', or words to that effect. The panel also ruled that she made racially motivated comments about Asian junior doctors. 'What have you got in your rucksack doctor, is it a bomb?' she is reported to have said. She is also accused of calling them 'suicide bombers' or 'Osama’s mate'. The panel also found that she made inappropriate comments about three other colleagues. With respect to one male nurse, she said she would 'would make his life hell and get rid of him in six months' and 'would drive him to drink and he would be out of here'. And when he was admitted to hospital after taking an overdose she said words to the effect of: 'He should have taken a few more pills and done the job properly', the panel found. She also said “I don’t care if she lives or dies”, or words to that effect, when another colleague was taken to hospital with a head injury, they said. Under fire: Both nurses worked at Stafford Hospital . Ms Turner also said something along the lines of: “I am going to have her if it’s the last thing I do” about another nurse,. In October 2007, she actively encouraged fellow nurses to 'lie about it' when she discovered that the trust was breaching the four hour treatment time target in A&E. She also condemned colleagues for informing the clinical site manager about the breach. They also found that she inaccurately recorded patient discharge times and instructed staff to transfer patients to wards with 'soiled sheets', the panel judged. The panel ruled that most elements of the six charges of misconduct against her were 'proved' but they also ruled some elements, such as referring to a nurse as a 'junior muppet', were not proved. An NMC panel also ruled that A&E nurse Tracey White  refused to help a senior nurse undress an elderly patient and called her a 'naughty little monkey' for refusing to take drugs to treat constipation. They also found that in relation to a patient who had attended A&E following a termination of their pregnancy, Ms White said words to the effect of: 'she can wait, if you can do that to your baby'. Between July 2000 and July 2010 she is also accused of inaccurately recording patient discharge times from A&E,and ordering other colleagues to follow her example. The panel also ruled that she changed patient records so that it would appear that the department was meeting waiting time targets. It also judged that she ordered staff to move patients on to a different parts of the hospital before they had been properly assessed by A&E staff and transferred patients to wards with soiled sheets, they found. Ms White faced five charges of misconduct but the independent panel found that she had 'no case to answer for' for one allegation of falsifying computer records for the time a patient was admitted to A&E. They also ruled that the facts were 'not proved' for some elements of the other allegations against her. The independent panel will decide whether the pair are still fit to practice. If they deem that their fitness to practise is impaired, the panel will determine what sanctions should be imposed against the two women. Stafford Hospital was the subject of a two-year public inquiry into its appalling standards of care.Official documents suggest up to 1,200 more patients than expected died at the Weston Road site between 2005 and 2008. The inquiry highlighted the 'appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of people' at the trust.Probes into the scandal revealed that many patients were left lying in their own urine and excrement for days, forced to drink water from vases or given the wrong medication. Maggie Oldham, chief executive at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'Tracey White is still employed by the trust and works as a clinical site manager. 'We will need to take some time to consider the Nursing and Midwifery Council panel’s findings once they announce their decisions. 'Sharon Turner is no longer employed by the trust. She left her emergency department sister post in September 2009.'","Sharon .

Accused: Court clerk David Kelly is charged with perverting the course of justice by helping drivers escape penalty points in return for cash . A rogue court clerk was allegedly paid thousands of pounds by motorists who wanted to avoid driving bans in an illegal scam organised under magistrates' noses. Clerical assistant David Kelly, 47, is accused of operating the racket for six years. In that time he allegedly helped 71 drivers remove details of convictions, disqualifications and penalty points on 110 occasions. A court heard motorists would hand over cash to have their licences 'cleaned' of offences such as speeding or using a mobile phone at the wheel. Jurors were told the deals were done through 'middlemen' and, once the money was received, forms were sent from the court to the DVLA, requesting the convictions be deleted. The alleged scam at Liverpool  magistrates’ court, described as an open secret in the city, was eventually uncovered when officials at the DVLA became suspicious about the number of forms they were receiving from the court. Kelly, who lives with his wife Carol in Liverpool, had been working in the administration department at the magistrates’ court for around 20 years. As part of his responsibilities he would sometimes contact the DVLA to update records. He allegedly carried out the scam by forging forms to ‘falsely claim’ that Liverpool magistrates had removed or quashed the convictions. 'Open secret': The jury was told it was well-known in the city that Kelly ran a scam at Liverpool Magistrates' Court, pictured . Found out: The alleged scam was rumbled when the DVLA became suspicious about the number of forms they were receiving from Liverpool Magistrates' Court . Jonathan Sandiford, prosecuting, told . Preston Crown Court: ‘Between 2004 and 2010 the Crown says that Kelly . abused his position to  unlawfully procure the removal from drivers’ records maintained by the DVLA the details of convictions, penalty . points and disqualifications against more than 70 people. 'The Crown says . the only sensible motive for Kelly’s actions that jeopardised his . employment and exposed him to the risk of criminal prosecution was . financial gain.’ Kelly was joined by four of his alleged ‘customers’ in the dock. Mark Camello, 33, Samantha Evans, 25, Shaun Robinson, 24 and Terence Nash, 27, who all deny perverting the course of justice. Evans denies an additional charge of fraud. Evans is alleged to have paid Kelly to have two points removed from her licence because she had accrued nine points and was at risk of losing it. In the dock: Shaun Robinson, left, and Terence Nash, right, have denied perverting the course of justice . It is claimed she also used the scam to defraud her insurance company to obtain cheaper cover by failing to disclose additional points on her licence that were subsequently removed. On trial: Mark Camello is accused of being one of Kelly's 'customers' The DVLA first became suspicious of Kelly in September 2008 when he sent a fax to the organisation containing a number of bogus forms. Officials raised their concerns with court management and Kelly was subjected to two 'fact finding' interviews. His explanations were accepted and he continued in his job, the court heard. But in April 2010, Kelly was allegedly caught after court staff discovered a number of driving licences, bogus forms and faxes that had been disposed of in a confidential waste sack. The court was told that most of the recovered documents were linked to Kelly by fingerprinting and handwriting evidence. Further evidence was allegedly found in Kelly’s desk and at his home during a police raid. Earlier this year nine motorists involved in the scam were jailed for a total of six years and three months. Another two were spared prison. All admitted perverting the course of justice. Kelly has pleaded not guilty to 23 counts of conspiracy to pervert the course of public justice. The trial continues.

The number of birds colliding with planes has nearly doubled over the past few years, according to an air safety watchdog. More than 2,200 reports such  incidents were recorded last year by the Civil Aviation Authority – almost twice the 1,299 ‘bird strikes’ that were recorded  in 2007. The figures show that around three ‘significant’ collisions take place in Britain every week. Hazard: In the most serious incidents, pilots have been forced to put out mayday messages after birds flew into their engines, causing them to fail . The most serious incidents saw pilots put out mayday messages as their engines failed. Other scares have seen planes dumping fuel to make emergency landings and cases where engines caught fire and fumes started to enter the cabin. The CAA report details 315 so-called ‘bird strike incidents’ in 2011 and 2012 that damaged the aircraft or created a flight safety hazard. One of the most serious accidents involved an Airbus A321 flying out of Luton which was hit by a flock of birds shortly after take off, forcing the pilot to shut off an engine. Another saw an Airbus A320 having to return to Heathrow shortly after being hit by a bird. Air strike: Flocks of birds have led to emergency landings in some places . And a passenger jet pilot declared an emergency after colliding with greenfinches as he was coming in to land at Gatwick. A CAA spokesman explained that pilots are now obliged to log every accident involving birds. ‘If a bird strike has been submitted, which has either caused damage to the aircraft or the bird strike has resulted in a flight safety hazard, then this would be reportable,’ he said. The most dangerous bird strike incident in recent years took place in New York when a US Airways Airbus A320 was forced to land in the Hudson River after being hit by a large flock of birds.","Civil Aviation Authority figures show three 'significant' collisions in UK each week .

A former art teacher who studied under Picasso and turned down a job offer from Walt Disney because of his love of education, died when his home full of hoarded 'junk' caught fire in the middle of the night. Builders smashed down the door and tried to rescue pensioner Donald 'Brian' Starkey but were defeated by toxic fumes. An inquest heard how the pensioner, from Dachet, Berkshire, had collected large amounts of clothing and paperwork in his later years, filling his home and not allowing other people in. A former art teacher who studied under Picasso and turned down a job offer from Walt Disney died when his home full of hoarded 'junk' caught fire in the middle of the night, an inquest has heard . The house fire in Dachet, Berkshire, claimed the life of 81 year old artist and hoarder Brian Starkey . Fire investigators suspected an electric heater in his bedroom ignited clothing, paper or bedding. While firefighters were still damping down the smouldering remains Mr Starkey's son arrived for an appointment with his father and social workers and was confronted by the large-scale emergency operation. Until he suffered a second stroke days before he died, the last known visitor to the 81-year-old's home had been 10 years previously. His son said he had not been in his father's house for 25 years. Following his death relatives paid tribute to a 'brilliant potter and artist' who had displayed a talent for illustration and animation. Walt Disney himself was said to have tried to tempt him to work for him but a love of teaching saw Mr Starkey turn down the opportunity. On March 6 this year nearby builders noticed smoke coming from his home and went to help, while also dialling 999. The blaze was so fierce that a large part of the interior of the property was gutted and Mr Starkey, who had been in his first floor bedroom, was found to have fallen through into the living room and then into the crawl space below that as the flames destroyed the detached house. His son Jonathan prepared a statement for his father's inquest in which he revealed his father's physical and mental deterioration. Builders tried to smash down the door and tried to rescue the pensioner but were defeated by toxic fumes . An inquest heard:''He accumulated junk over many years. Downstairs in places it was waist-high and, in places upstairs, shoulder-high' Reading the statement, coroner Peter Bedford said: 'He was a bit of a hoarder. 'He accumulated junk over many years. Downstairs in places it was waist-high and, in places upstairs, shoulder-high. 'It was paper, clothes and so on. All flammable.' He said Mr Starkey had suffered a stroke two years earlier which had affected his sight and rendered him almost deaf. He then had another one two weeks before he died which severely restricted his mobility, meaning he could only shuffle along in small steps. The son said he had tried to get him to go into a care home. 'He was a proud man and didn't like the idea of accepting help,' he said. 'He had made comments to me on several occasions, saying: ""I can't cope. I don't want to go on"", but I'm not sure he had the capacity to consider harming himself.' The pensioner, who had taught pottery and ceramics at Sutton College of Art for 30 years, would habitually sleep with an electric blanket on his bed all night. Mr Starkey had suffered a stroke two years earlier which had affected his sight and rendered him almost deaf . He also used electric heaters throughout the house and had done some of his own electrical wiring.Steve Wallbanks, aged 36 years, who was working at a nearby house, in Linchfield Road, Datchet, Berks., on the fateful day, said: 'We got here to work at 8am and were climbing up the scaffolding when we saw smoke on the tiles of the house over there. 'We thought we would go and have a look and as we went over the smell was incredible. It was toxic. 'We noticed the smoke was coming out of the roof and we knocked at the neighbour's and she said an elderly gent lived there. 'I went around straightaway and kicked in the door and tried to get in there but it was the fumes that stopped me. 'I could see up the stairs and I felt the front room door and it was really hot so I knew not to open that.'I went in and out three times, deciding whether or not to go upstairs but I thought: ""I've got five kids of my own"".' The former art teacher trained under Picasso (left) and Walt Disney himself (right) was said to have . tried to tempt him to work for him but a love of teaching saw Mr Starkey . turn down the opportunity. Colleague Damian Glaister, aged 27 years, remained outside on the phone to emergency services.Mr Wallbanks, who was left coughing and spluttering because of the smoke he inhaled, said: 'Any one of us here would have done the same. I just wanted to go in and see what we could do. It's just sad that there was somebody in there.' More than 20 firefighters had tackled the flames. An investigation found 'it is most probably an electric heater in bedroom one (Mr Starkey's) was placed too close to combustible material' yet could not rule out another potential source. Mr Bedford, the coroner for Berkshire, told the hearing in Windsor Guildhall that he was recording a verdict of accidental death. Mr Starkey is survived by his former wife Margaret, four sons, seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.","Builders tried to rescue Donald 'Brian' Starkey but overwhelmed by fumes .

The service, using new satellite technology, could even be faster than most people get at home, allowing travellers to enjoy online activities such as streaming films and music. Even if it does not reach the highest possible speeds, it would still be ten to 20 times faster than the limited internet services currently offered by a handful of airlines. End of an era: Having to wait until you land to check your emails or Facebook page could soon be over as new satellite technology could provide airline passengers with super-fast broadband while in the sky (stock image) The broadcast regulator Ofcom is . considering whether to approve use of the new technology – called Earth . Stations on Mobile Platforms – which would also be available on trains . and cruise ships from next year. It could offer broadband at 50mbps . (megabits per second) – compared with 14.7mbps for the average home . connection – although technology experts believe 10mbps is more . realistic. It uses advanced receivers to pick up . signals from high-frequency satellites, even when the vehicles they are . fitted to are travelling fast. It is not known how much the service . would cost and companies are likely to sign up to offer it only if there . is a high demand from customers. Satellite internet does not use telephone lines or cable systems to link customers to the web but instead uses a satellite in space to transmit data. Almost all ships have terminals in built that can send data to satellites which in turn connect to earth stations or mobile platforms on land which are connected to the internet. Planes can use antennas placed on the craft which operate in the same way to allow people on-board to connect to the internet. After the antennas have transmitted data to a satellite, it is then sent to the nearest earth station. Once there, the internet request is dealt with in the same way it would be if it were on a land-based internet connection before the information is pinged back to the web user on the plane via the satellite. This service is already available or being trialled by different airlines but is incredibly slow. Satellite operators now hope to launch satellites with new technology which will be placed in geostationary obit. They operate on a different frequency to those already in use and transmit significantly more data at faster speeds. Companies such as Inmarsat own their own earth stations so they will be able the data's entire journey from being transmitted to the satellite on to a land base and back again. Ofcom has launched a consultation on the new technology which could be up and running by the beginning of next year. It will then be up to individual airlines if they want to pay the satellite operator for the service so their customers can access super-fast broadband. Current in-flight offerings are . extremely slow. On some BA business-class flights, for example, . passengers can send texts and receive limited data on 2G mobile . networks. They are charged international roaming rates by their mobile . phone carriers. Even a broadband trial on Virgin . Atlantic’s A330 aircraft to the US and India only offers speeds of . around 432kbps (kilobits per second). The airline has yet to decide how . much to charge. Ofcom’s policy director, Charles . Jenne, said: ‘Recent innovations in satellite technology mean that it’s . now possible for planes, ships and trains to access the internet at . speeds closer to what you’d expect from home broadband. ‘Ofcom is proposing to allow the use . of this technology in the UK, which could benefit business users and . holidaymakers who want to stay connected while travelling.’ The reason the broadband service will . be so much faster than those already on the market is because the new . satellites work on a higher frequency than those currently in use and . are capable of carrying more data to individual receptors placed on . moving vehicles. Satellite . companies hoping to offer this technology claim they can offer speeds . of up to 50 Mega-bits per second (mbps) - a significant improvement on . the average 430kbps broadband service currently being tested by some . airlines. In comparison, the proposed 50mbps service would be more than three times the average home broadband speed of 14.7mbps. If . Ofcom clears the way for the new broadband technology, it will be up to . satellite providers to open up the service so private companies such as . airlines can decide if they want to pay for it. Private companies can then offer the . super-fast broadband service to their customers. But it will be up to . the companies how much they will charge for the high-speed access. As the satellites will initially . provide the broadband directly to jets, boats or trains, the technology . will not immediately impact on individual's broadband services. But . in theory, the satellite companies could offer their faster satellite . broadband to homeowners as well as large corporations in the future. Airlines have welcomed the consultation on the new technology - entitled Earth Stations on Mobile Platforms. Companies such as Virgin Atlantic are already trialling on-board Wi-Fi to see how much demand there is from their customers. But the current Wi-Fi available is much slower than service the new satellite technology would offer. It . is not known how much this service will cost and companies are only . likely to sign up to the satellite service if there is a high demand for . it from customers. Big interest: Airlines, including Virgin Atlantic, pictured, and British Airways, have welcomed the consultation . A Virgin Atlantic spokeswoman said: 'Virgin Atlantic has noted this Ofcom consultation with interest. 'We . welcome any developments that can enhance the passenger experience and . are always looking for new and innovative ways to do this on our . aircraft. If these proposals become a reality we would be interested in . looking into this further. 'However . our current focus is a WiFi trial across some of our long haul flights, . which we hope to roll out more widely next year.' British Airways also welcomed the consultation . British Airways inflight . entertainment and technology manager Richard D'Cruze said: 'We are . always interested in employing new technology to improve the service . that we can offer our customers, and are closely monitoring developments . in the connectivity market in both the satellite and direct . air-to-ground technology areas. 'We . are about to embark upon a year long connectivity trial using one of . our Boeing 747's fitted with a broadband satellite system. 'Customers . travelling on our international routes will be able to access the . internet as well as stream media content including live television . channels to their personal devices. The trial will allow us to test . customer demand for such services to help inform our product strategy.' While . companies in the UK are still trialling offering internet access . on-board their flights, American Airlines offers its passengers a day . Wi-Fi pass on its domestic flights at a cost of up to $21.95 (around . £14). An international duration of flight pass costs $19. But the company does not list the speed of its Wi-Fi access on its website. The consultation  is likely to involve some of the world's biggest satellite operators such as Inmarsat and Eutelsat. If it proves to be a success the technology could be available as early as next year. Immarsat hopes to launch three of these new satellites at the end of the year. They will be placed in geostationary . obit over the equator and, the company claims, will be able to provide . super-fast broadband anywhere in the world. Advanced: New satellites will be able to provide super-fast broadband by operating on a higher frequency than those currently in operation (Inmarsat image) Miranda Mills, Vice President of Aviation at Inmarsat said: 'Inmarsat’s Global Xpress (GX) will be the world's first global super-fast broadband service and it is going to revolutionise mobile connectivity on land, at sea and in the air. 'We have invested $1.2bn in GX and the first of our three spacecraft is scheduled to be launched later this year, followed by a further two satellites in 2014. 'Based on Ka-band technology, each satellite has a combination of fixed narrow spot beams that enable us to deliver higher speeds through more compact terminals; and steerable beams so additional capacity can be directed in real-time to where it's needed. 'Through GX, airline passengers can remain connected wherever they fly. GX will enable them to connect their smartphones, tablets and laptops or any other WiFi-enabled device to the Internet and enjoy a broadband experience akin to what they have at home or in the office.' Ofcom policy director Charles Jenne said: 'The internet has fundamentally changed the way we live our lives, with many people wanting to stay connected when they are travelling. 'This might be updating their Facebook status, sending a work email, or checking the latest news headlines. 'Ofcom has been working with its European counterparts for the past two years to create a framework to allow the introduction of new satellite technology that will significantly increase the connection speeds for these travellers.' He added: 'Recent innovations in satellite technology mean that it’s now possible for planes, ships and trains to access the internet at speeds closer to what you’d expect from home broadband. 'Ofcom is proposing to allow the use of this technology in the UK, which could benefit business users and holiday makers who want to stay connected while travelling.'","Passengers currently only have limited access to the internet on flights .

A cache of letters written during the last years of her life more than a century ago show that the monarch regularly used contractions . If your teenager drives you mad by using ‘text speak’, take heart – they may simply be emulating Queen Victoria. A cache of letters written during the last years of her life more than a century ago show that the monarch regularly used contractions, such as ‘shd’ and ‘wd’ instead of ‘should’ and ‘would’. For example, in one note about a visit to Balmoral she wrote: ‘I have never invited the Duke of Atholl to come over with his men and I think it wd. be better not to do so this year. It wd. entail the encampment of his men in our grounds wh. wd. be inconvenient.’ The revelation comes in a series of letters that were handwritten by Victoria in the four years before her death in 1901 and were addressed to James Forbes, the man who was responsible for the running of Balmoral. The letters and other royal memorabilia have just been sold for £15,000 at auction in Edinburgh, £7,000 more than expected. Experts at Bonhams said that the correspondence shows the Queen’s keen interest in the welfare of her staff and tenants and continued appetite for life despite her advancing years. All the letters are written on the heavy mourning paper she adopted on the death of Prince Albert in 1861 and most are signed VR1. They were sent from Windsor, Osborne and Nice as well as internally at Balmoral itself. Henry Baggott, Bonhams book specialist in Edinburgh, said: 'These letters throw a fascinating light on the private Queen Victoria and show her to have been far kinder and more considerate than her rather forbidding public image suggested.' He added that the letters give a particularly vivid impression of Victoria’s personality. A series of letters hand written by Queen Victoria to the manager of Balmoral Castle fetched £15,000 pounds at auction .

'But I fear Mr S. is of a vindictive spirit and I rather fear, not very exact himself. At any rate you shd try & find out the story abt the Free Kirk Minister, as I am sure that that is a ‘mistake’.' Queen Victoria was always solicitous about her staff whom she regarded as part of her extended family. The collection also includes several items relating to Queen Victoria’s friendship with servant John Brown, which was the focus of the 1997 historical drama Mrs Brown starring Dame Judi Dench and Billy Connolly.

Once grown only in the sun-drenched Mediterranean climate, melons are now arriving fresh from the fields of Britain. Farmers in Kent and Staffordshire are about to deliver thousands of cantaloupes and galias to the major supermarkets. They are using polytunnels in which strawberries are produced earlier in the year. Ready to eat: The first pick of Magenta melons, which look similar to Cantaloupe melons (pictured), were harvested last week and supplied to local fruit markets in Kent . Adaptation: Farmers have been growing melons in the polytunnels used for this year's strawberries . Pleased as punch: Melon farmers Tony Frankham and Beverley Hawkins with the first British crop of cantaloupe melons grown at Newmafruit farm . Most of the melons imported to the UK . from Italy, Spain and southern France are harvested before they ripen . and treated with chemicals to prevent them spoiling during transport. By contrast, those grown in this country are picked when ripe and will be in the shops within a few days. This suggests that they should be particularly tasty and healthy. Marks & Spencer is about to take delivery of melons grown in Staffordshire. The chain’s fruit expert, Bill . Davies, said: ‘These British melons are a win-win fruit for our . customers, who have delicious fruit, and our farmers who can reuse the . valuable land that is left once the strawberry crop has finished.’ The Kent company Newmafruit, based near Canterbury, is harvesting its first crop of 5,000 cantaloupes this year. Juicy: Experts say the British melons are likely to be tastier and healthier because they are so ripe . Cash crops: Newmafruit specialises in apples and pears and supplies 26 varieties of apple and six of pear, plus cherries, plums and soft fruit to UK supermarkets . They will be sold through Morrisons and Co-op stores, with hopes of expansion. The company’s managing director, Tony . Frankham, said: ‘The early indications are this has been very . successful. The melons are looking absolutely fantastic.’ The fact that warm weather crops can . now be grown in this country is seen as evidence of both improvements in . farming techniques and a change in the climate. The chalk slopes of southern Britain . are producing excellent grapes and wine, while sweetcorn is grown on a . significant scale as far north as Yorkshire. M&S expects to receive five tons of British apricots, which would normally be grown in France, from a Kent farm. Newmafruit Farms Ltd and Newmafruit International Ltd manage over 1300 acres of orchard and soft fruit production, with extensive warehousing, storage and packing facilities. The company handles over 60,000 tonnes of product a year, the majority of which consists of 26 varieties of apple and six of pear, plus cherries, plums and soft fruit.","Farms in Kent and Staffordshire about to deliver thousands of cantaloupes and galias to major supermarkets .

A drug user ransacked his parents' home and stole £50,000 of their belongings including his own son's toys and piggybank  while they took his child on holiday, a court heard today. The parents of Michael Pinkney have told of their horror at his betrayal as he was jailed for five years at Teesside Crown Court. Pinkney was given a door key so he could decorate while his mother and step-father treated his son to a break in Spain. Betrayal: Drug user Michael Pinkney has been jailed for five years at Teesside Crown Court after burgling his parents Dave and Lynne Hamer's home while they took his son on holiday . Chaos: The Hamers' ransacked home which was stripped of £50,000 worth of belongings - including his own son's toys . But once they were gone, the 30-year-old systematically ransacked their house. Judge Howard Crowson - branding his actions a gross breach of trust - said the items were 'frittered away' after being sold at a fraction of their value. Pinkney took scores of items, including £2,000 cash, beds, furniture, jewellery, power tools, a television, lap top, washing machine and even his own son's toys, including a mountain bike. His mother, Lynne Hamer, 65, and her husband, Dave, told how they had 'broken ties' with Pinkney - but were committed to continue caring for their grandchild. Speaking after the case on Tuesday, Mrs Hamer said they returned last month from a fortnight's holiday in Marbella to find their Stockton home trashed. Even mirrors and pictures had been taken from the walls, floorboards pulled up and a piggy bank raided. 'I texted him (Pinkney) from Newcastle Airport when we got back to say ""the bairn's really excited to see you and show you all the pictures"", but there was no response', she said. 'When we got home and saw the place I was so bad I couldn't breathe. It was like I had lost control of my body. Even the police were horrified.' Heartless: Pinkney even ripped up floorboards in the house he was supposed to be decorating as he sold off items for much less than they were worth . Terrible: Lynne Hamer said she couldn't breath when she came home from holiday to see the rooms had been turned over . Mr Hamer, who like his wife works in social care, said some of the stolen items, including gym equipment, were very heavy and must have taken more than one person to move them over a number of days. Thief: Pinkney had been given a door key while his mother and step-father treated his child to a holiday in Spain, and he abused the privilege . The couple, who care for Pinkney's son and who had decorated and furnished his flat, said Pinkney had been 'doing well' and seemed drug free before they left  for Spain. 'Michael seemed to be doing well, and even had a nice girlfriend, but I have to break ties with Michael now,' Mrs Hamer added. The couple's workmates raised £350 to buy a new bike, toys and computer equipment for the child. Mrs Hamer's other two sons helped replace their furniture while other friends also rallied around. The couple are claiming £23,000 from their house insurance but are yet to receive a pay out - however, prosecutors estimate the true value at £50,000. David Crook, prosecuting, told Teesside Crown Court: 'Given the amount of property taken it would have required a high degree of organisation. It was not just somebody walking out with a bag.' Pinkney, Stockton, admitted burglary between July 13 and 27 this year and a street robbery, in which a 17-year-old girl had her handbag wrestled from her grasp - leaving her feeling 'abused, invaded and scared'. Uzma Khan, mitigating, said Pinkney had been offence and drug free since 2004 but at the time was dealing with the loss of his brother and father and a family rift. 'He was at an all time low,' she said. 'With others, completely unplanned, he took the items to pay for his drug habit.' She described him as 'utterly remorseful'. Referring to the burglary, Judge Crowson told him: 'Your mother who is looking after your own child went on holiday and left you with access to their home. 'Thinking of yourself and your own drug dependency before they returned you ransacked the home an left an enormous amount of property missing.' He said Pinkney was a man capable of good, but nonetheless jailed him for a total of five years for both offences.","Michael Pinkney said he'd decorate their home while they took his child .

A would-be doctor murdered in an apparently unprovoked stabbing achieved top grades in his GCSEs, his teacher has revealed. Ajmol Alom, 16, described as 'one of our brightest prospects' by his headmaster, died after he was wounded in the thigh in Poplar, east London, on August 12. The teenager, who went to Langdon Park School in Poplar, achieved eight grade As in subjects including maths, science, English literature, geography, religious studies and citizenship; and three B grades in English language, humanities and physical education. Ajmol Alom, who was murdered in an apparently unprovoked attack, achieved eight grade As and three grade Bs in his GCSEs . Headteacher Chris Dunne said: 'One of the careers he was considering was in medicine, and these results would have made that a very real possibility in terms of university entrance. 'All the many journalists who interviewed me after the horrifying event of his murder wanted to know how ""good"" he was as a student. I was able to say without hesitation that he was very able, looking forward to GCSE results at a very high level and very capable of going on to achieve the kind of grades which would have secured him a place at any one of our best universities.' He said that he had interviewed Ajmol for a place in the school’s new sixth form a few weeks ago, and that he would remember most 'how hardworking he was as a student, and how very decent he was as a person'. Mr Dunne went on: 'Some youngsters as able as Ajmol don’t ever realise their full potential because they aren’t prepared to do what’s necessary to ensure success. Some are remembered for the way they show off their cleverness at the expense of other, less able students. Ajmol’s approach was the opposite. Ajmol was described as 'one of our brightest prospects' by his headmaster at Langdon Park School in Poplar . Police officers guard the scene where 16-year-old Ajmol Alom was allegedly stabbed . 'He would always have been the last person to boast of his ability. He regularly attended the extra classes and revision sessions run by his teachers, even when he probably didn’t need their help any longer. His friends could rely on him for help if they needed it, not for arrogance or scorn.' The teacher said his last memory of the keen boxer was when he volunteered to be part of a peace project in Northern Ireland. Mr Dunne went on: 'We are constantly bombarded with negative stories about young people, about their poor attitudes and anti-social behaviour. Working in schools and youth clubs for the past 40 years I have learned the opposite, that the vast majority of young people are in fact very decent, and undoubtedly go on to be equally decent adults. Ajmol's headteacher said his last memory of the keen boxer was when he volunteered to be part of a peace project in Northern Ireland . 'Our school, our community, our country . has just lost one of its brightest prospects and we are all rightly . shocked and depressed by it. The best comfort we can take from it is . that, for however a short a time, those of us that knew Ajmol knew a . very splendid young man and a fine citizen.' Three men have been arrested in connection with the alleged offence. One, 19-year-old Aminur Khan from Poplar, has been charged with murder and appeared in court on Monday. The two others have been bailed until a date in September. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Ajmol Alom died after he was stabbed in the thigh in Poplar, east London .

It won’t always be quite like this. But it’s safe to say that you are very, very welcome. At 7.13pm, the doors of the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, swung open to reveal the sight which opens another chapter in our extraordinary royal story. Held tight in the arms of his (astonishingly poised) mother, our next King but two made his public debut – and first royal wave – in front of a live global audience of many hundreds of millions. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Let me have a go: William tentatively reaches for the baby . So... how do we do this? The Duke ponders the mechanics . Let the handover begin: Kate leans in, but keeps a firm hold . Easy does it: She slowly lowers the baby towards his father with William appearing tense as he finally takes over . It is hard to recall a royal appearance more keenly awaited than this one. Even that post-wedding balcony kiss couldn’t quite trump the moment. In more than 20 years of covering royal events, I can’t remember a scene quite so full of raw, impromptu joy. With scenes of delirious chaos all around, this well-wrapped bundle of love, hope and a nation’s expectations was then transferred into the arms of his father. Like any new dad, it was an anxious moment before the handover was safely completed. The Duke of Cambridge could scarcely keep his eyes off his son and heir. This most private of men had no qualms in admitting that the whole thing had been ‘very emotional – very special’. He told us: ‘Well, he’s got a good pair of lungs on him, that’s for sure. He’s a big boy, he’s quite heavy.’ ‘It’s very emotional and such a special time,’ the Duchess, chimed in, as fresh as her floaty blue dress. ‘I think any parent will probably know what this feeling feels like.’ Considering the magnitude of the moment, it is safe to say that these two will be a safe pair of hands in a national crisis. ‘He’s got her looks, thankfully,’ joked the Duke. ‘No, no, no,’ she bounced back. ‘I’m not sure about that.’ Have a look at those scenes again (you won’t have much choice over the next few days). Note the way that the Duchess looks at her husband even more than at her baby; she is manifestly just as proud of him as of her little boy. ‘He’s done the first nappy already,’ she told us. No name yet, of course, but more self-deprecating humour. Asked about the baby’s hair, the Duke reflected: ‘He’s got way more than me, thank God.’ Oh, I've got him! The anxious expression dissolves into delight . Family unit: The Duchess looks on as William concentrates . Check him out! She appears proud of her husband's efforts . Look of love: William cannot hide the emotion on his face as the doting dad finally begins to relax . And with that, they briefly retired indoors for what is usually a fractious rite of passage: attaching the child to the car seat. Had the Duke been in training? Without so much as a cross word, let alone a fumble with the instruction book, he slotted our newest HRH into the back seat with a slickness that will infuriate new fathers everywhere. They say that a baby crocodile regards the first thing it sees as its mother. Let’s hope the same does not apply to monarchs and their subjects. Poor Prince X’s first glimpse of his people was not a pretty one – several hundred frazzled, sunburned, rain-soaked cameramen. There, hospital staff of every rank and responsibility had been given plum positions either side of the doors. They couldn’t decide whether to clap or film the moment on their mobile phones. Many did both, cheering at the same time. Here was a complete cross-section of hospital life, a happy jumble of name badges – ‘nursery nurse’, ‘works administrator’, ‘sister’. Special moment: Prince William and Kate waved and smiled broadly as they carried their son out of hospital, but they are yet to decide on a name . New life: The baby was crying in his car seat as his father took him to their waiting car yesterday evening . Magic: With the world watching, Kate and William hold their prince outside the Lindo Wing in a genuinely historic moment for Britain . Emotional: The new mother looked delighted as she looked down at her first child while her husband waved to the excited crowds . Protective: The baby was wrapped in a white shawl - Kate held her new son closely to her chest as she waved to the impressive crowd . The safe hands of the Duchess of Cambridge with her son who was born on Monday, but was thrown into the spotlight yesterday . Craning over a  railing, another revealed herself to  be ‘bookings co-ordinator’. She must have been busy lately. The . world has seen the media circus on the outside. These staff have . experienced this happy – and good-natured – siege from within. All were, . understandably, tight-lipped on details afterwards. But they were . delighted to reflect on their moment of collective glory. ‘I can’t begin to say what I feel – . just over the moon,’ said Mary Grafton, business manager of the Lindo . Wing. Alongside her stood Marielle Bouqueau, a young midwife almost . speechless in the excitement of the moment. These are people who see the . extremes of human emotion every day. Even they could not quite take it . all in. Up on high, every floor of the Queen . Mother building had faces squashed against the glass. On the fourth . floor, I counted ten staff togged up in blue surgical scrubs – hats and . all. One hoped that all had finished their work for the day. Although .

Angry Jury Ovodov, 49, had been turned down on the grounds that he had not had a sex change operation and was still physically a man. Now he is taking the passport service in Ekaterinburg to court claiming that he's been discriminated against because he is not wealthy.

'But that doesn't mean they can deny me my right to be a woman.' He now wants to be known as Julia Solovleva. Ovodov says officials are preventing him from expressing himself freely. 'I am a woman inside. It's just the lack of money that's stopping me,' he said. Point of contention: The Russian passport currently only accepts male or female as possible genders . In Australia, they have come up with a compromise to accommodate such a disagreement. From July, Australians could register as 'intersex' on their passports. Like Ovodov, people do not need to have completed a sex change to be eligible for the third gender option.","Jury Ovodov, 49, is suing Russian passport officials .

There was a time (back in the lower reaches of the early Nineties) when a personalised mixtape with an inlay sleeve garnished with doodles and sweet nothings was just about the most romantic present you could ever give someone. But the advent of the internet, the iTunes playlist and the Spotify invite sounded the death knell for those halcyon days of holding music on something physical and swooning. Until now. The mixtape - or, rather, the mix CD - is having a renaissance, thanks to an online service enabling you to craft your own bespoke disc and design the cover sleeve. Described as 'Moonpig meets iTunes', London-based music start-up MixPixie has licensing deals with record labels including Sony, Universal, EMI and Warner, so boasts over 15 million songs on their database. They also have more than 500 album designs to choose from. Chef Nigella Lawson, singer Olly Murs and comedian Alan Carr have proclaimed themselves fans, while the brand has worked with musicians including Justin Bieber and Lionel Richie to craft personalised albums. Commenting on the service, Nigella Lawson said she was 'thoroughly going to enjoy' her CD, while Alan Carr said: 'Lovely personalised CDs... How did YOU know I loved Jennifer Rush's Power Of Love? Ha Ha.' Justin Bieber, left, has worked with MixPixie to create a personalised album, while foodie Nigella Lawson, right, has declared herself a fan of the music start-up . Customers can pick from a list of pre-made designs - including those for a new baby, an engagement, a birthday, holiday, exams and retirement - each of which come with a list of suggested songs to feature on your unique playlist. You can also add to the personalised aspect of the product by uploading your own photo for the cover, and adding a recorded voice message for the recipient. Each £5 CD can have a maximum of 10 songs, each of which cost an additional 99p, and you can review what it will look like before you part with your cash and have the finished product delivered to your door for £2.99. The idea for the service came about in 2009 when record company executive Buffie du Pon, then 31, found a romantic Valentine's Day mix CD on her doormat.... but addressed to someone called Sarah. Dispirited that it wasn't for her but inspired by the retro idea, Buffie met up with her friends Adam Goodyer and James Perkins and MixPixie was born. She still has the CD for Sarah.

Target: Former Coronation Street star Helen Flanagan was victimised by DJ's at Manchester's Key 103 radio station . But angry listeners hit back and accused the station of promoting bullying, prompting the network to apologise and remove the poll from the internet, admitting it was “inappropriate”. The blunder comes after claims that a second teenager in a month appears to have taken his own life as a result of online bullying. Apprentice mechanic Daniel Perry, 17, threw himself from the Forth Road Bridge after being blackmailed by online bullies, while 14-year-old Hannah Smith is believed to have been subjected to taunts online before taking her own life. A Key 103 spokesman said: 'Yesterday some comments were made on air and on Facebook about Helen Flanagan and for that we sincerely apologise.  We are sorry for any offence this caused.'

Ed Miliband was told to look in the mirror and ask whether the 'electorate ever assent to me being Prime Minister?' Ed Miliband should consider resigning for the sake of the Labour Party, a senior Blairite warned yesterday. Brian Wilson, who served as energy minister under Tony Blair, said the Labour leader had a duty to 'look in the mirror and honestly answer the question: 'Will the electorate ever assent to me being Prime Minister?' Mr Wilson, who held a number of other senior roles, said opinion poll findings on Mr Miliband's personal popularity were 'somewhere between dire and disappointing'. He said Labour could not afford to follow Mr Miliband 'lemming like' to defeat, as it had with Michael Foot and Gordon Brown. In . a further blow, Mr Miliband came under fire from one of his own . frontbench team over his failure to 'do more' to make the positive case . for immigration. Shadow . public health minister Diane Abbott suggested Mr Miliband privately . supported immigration and had his 'heart in the right place'. But she . said he was too swayed by opinion polls on the issue showing that the . open door approach of the last Labour government was now deeply . unpopular. She said 'What weighs with him is the polling which shows what the Tories are doing on immigration is popular and it certainly weighs on other members of the shadow cabinet.' Mr Wilson joins a chorus of despair from senior Labour figures about Mr Miliband's performance as party leader. Writing in the Scotsman, he said there was no shame in leaders accepting they were not up to the job. He pointed out that both William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith had gone on to high office after putting in dismal performances as party leaders. Bad day: Ed Milliband found himself under attack from former energy secretary Brian Wilson who described his personal popularity as 'somewhere between dire and disappointing' No More: Mr Wilson claims the party cannot afford to follow 'lemming like' behind another failing leader who will lose the election as they did with Gordon Brown and Michael Foot, right . 'Giving leadership a decent shot and then getting out does not necessarily mean the end of a political career - a consideration that should make it easier for future doomed leaders to consider their options,' he said. 'He must look in the mirror and honestly answer the question: Will the electorate ever assent to me being Prime Minister?' Ex-energy minister Brian Wilson yesterday . He backed growing calls for Mr Miliband to bring back heavyweight figures such as former Chancellor Alistair Darling and former Home Secretary Alan Johnson. He added: 'Of course, there is a risk in that for Miliband because it is possible that he would not shine as leaders should in the company of their colleagues. But there is a bigger risk in ploughing on as before with a lightweight team that appears to hop from one opportunist issue to the next, has failed to develop a strong, appealing narrative and is hanging on to a poll lead that could be blown away by the first whiff of electoral grapeshot.' Mr Wilson said Mr Miliband was 'not yet' at the point reached by Michael Foot where defeat is inevitable. But he suggested Labour should be more ruthless than in the past if his performance continues to disappoint and he refuses to stand aside. He added: 'Labour has a dismal record of indecisiveness even when all common sense suggests that its leader is not going to make it past the winning post. Partly, this is due to the unwieldiness of its internal machinery while kindness and loyalty are also significant factors, though the true kindness would sometimes be to act rather than acquiesce.' Mr Wilson also criticised Mr Miliband . for his failure to defend the record of the last Labour government, . adding: 'Miliband and his unattractive shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, have . spent far too much of the past two years apologising for the record . rather than defending it, which is the prerequisite for offering a . credible alternative.' The . criticism comes as a senior member of the shadow cabinet admits that a . u-turn over the universal credit reforms may feature on their election . manifesto. Former leader hopeful Diane Abbott also challenged Miliband today saying that he is too swayed by opinion polls when forming his policies . In a speech in North London today, shadow . work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne launched stinging . attacks at Iain Duncan Smith for not implementing the plans better, . claiming there 'seems to be something very wrong in the mind' of the the . Work and Pensions Secretary. But having vehemently opposed the changes to the benefits system he says his party now wants to work with the Government to turn around the universal credit reforms and 'hopes' to run at the next general election pledging to keep the new system. He said he would be writing to Mr Duncan Smith urging him to convene cross party talks with civil servants to save the flagship universal credit reforms from becoming a 'sinking ship.' But despite his criticism when asked if he now wanted the policy to succeed he agreed, saying:'I hope so, I sincerely hope so, but right now we have had so much dissembling we don’t know what is going on. 'If we’re going to get things . straight, the first step is to put the cards on the table, tell us what . is going wrong and perhaps we can work together.' But . Mr Byrne added that despite his criticism his own party, should they . win the next election, would also implement a scheme of benefit reform. In . a speech to the mentoring charity Chance UK he described his rival . reforms as 'tackling the long-term drivers of spending', insisting . Labour’s plans would be based on the twin principles of the 'care ethic' and the 'work ethic.' Labour's Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Liam Byrne claims that if the party won the next election he would launch their own version of the much condemned benefits change . But his claims were dismissed by the opposition with Mr Duncan Smith’s spokeswoman said Mr Byrne’s figures were 'nonsense.' She said: 'This is a last-ditch attempt by Liam Byrne to keep his job in the shadow cabinet.Nothing more. 'His talk of wasted money is frankly laughable when you consider Labour have voted against £83 billion-worth of savings to the welfare budget. 'Labour is panicking - after a summer of discontent, here is yet another disastrous speech, void of any ideas. 'Same old Labour is in the wrong place on welfare. 'They want people on benefits to make more money than the average hard-working family earns. 'They want unlimited amounts of benefits to be a basic human right. 'Labour have even gone as far as to ban the word ‘welfare’ in the hopes we all forget they are the Welfare Party. 'The taxpayer supports what we’re doing on welfare and Ed Miliband has got it wrong yet again.Universal credit is intended to roll six current benefits - including jobseeker’s allowance, working tax credits and housing benefit - into a single monthly payment and is currently being piloted.

Peter Pink, who describes himself as a 'nonsense maker' uses spuds and cucumbers to create the weird tableaus in public spaces. One of them sees potatoes on a beach, enjoying the recent fine weather by sunbathing. Hot potato: Artist Peter Pink uses vegetables to create surreal art installations, like this hilarious beach scene . No need for a jacket: Cocktail umbrellas and tiny plastic sunglasses are used as props in this scene . The artist says his inspiration comes from the need to clown around or question things . Another sees them protesting about their brethren getting sliced and fried outside a McDonalds restaurant, complete with a cordon to contain their demonstration. The theme of protest continues with the potatoes squaring off against the cucumbers, who stand impassive in a line against the unruly mob. Another installation sees one of the vegetables crucified on a tiny cross. His Berlin-based works also see cucumbers parading outside the iconic Reichstag building and even a French fry funeral. Showdown: A line of impassive cucumbers stand against protesting potatoes . Ominous: The work reflects on the issues of protest and consumerism, apparently . Massed potato: He said: 'One morning I had the idea of protesting potatoes. I already was using the sunglasses. 'So I put the sunglasses on the potatoes' A woman at Berlin's iconic Alexanderplatz snaps the weird artwork . Green berets: The cucumbers look like an army as they line up in formation .

Development: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling announced that plans to build Britain's biggest prison - holding about 2,000 inmates - had been given the green light . Plans to build Britain’s biggest prison – holding about 2,000 inmates – were given the green light yesterday. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling confirmed the £250million jail will be built in North Wales, near Wrexham, and expects it to be opened in 2017. Officials estimate the new jail, the first in North Wales, will save taxpayers £20million a year in lower running costs than traditional Victorian jails. But anti-prison groups called the new jail a ‘warehouse’, and called for the money to be spent on parenting programmes and treating drug addiction. Mr Grayling said that as well as providing a ‘massive boost to the Welsh economy’ it would allow inmates from the region to be held nearer to their families. He said: ‘My priority is to provide enough prison places for those sent there by the courts - and to do so in a way that gives taxpayers the best possible value for money.’ ‘This will be the first prison in north Wales and a massive boost to the Welsh economy. ‘It will provide around 1,000 much-needed jobs, great opportunities for local businesses and millions of pounds worth of construction opportunities.' Britain’s biggest prison by number of inmates is Oakwood in the West Midlands which holds 1605 inmates. Next in size are Liverpool and Birmingham jails which each hold around 1450. Wandsworth prison in South London has some 1300 places. But the new prison will be dwarfed by Europe’s largest, Fleury-Mérogis Prison in the outskirts of Paris which can hold 3,800 prisoners. As well as being cheaper, new prisons can provide more opportunities for rehabilitating offenders with purpose-built workshops and training centres. Keen: Mr Grayling said the new prison would allow inmates from the region to be nearer to their families. This is a file picture of a prison . But some anti-prison groups criticised the announcement, saying the jail would be a ‘warehouse’, which would put the public at risk. They said the money would be better spent on parenting programmes. Vicki Helyar-Cardwell, director of the Criminal Justice Alliance said: ‘Rather than pouring money into a new prison, the public would rather their money was invested in early intervention, such as treatment for the drug or mental health issues that offenders all too frequently experience as well as more parenting programmes.’ Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ‘This U-turn on pouring cash into a huge unwieldy prison is a titanic waste of money that puts public safety at risk.’","Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the jail will be built near Wrexham .

Children with severe asthma are to be given a potentially life-saving drug on the NHS after a U-turn by a health watchdog. The move means youngsters aged six to 11 will be able to benefit from Xolair injections for the first time. Those on a regular course of jabs are half as likely to have an asthma attack, and also half as likely to need hospital treatment if they do have an attack. Now children can benefit from a potentially life-saving drug on the NHS - the Xolair injections - following a U-turn by health watchdogs. The pictures shows young asthma sufferers at Angle Primary School, Pembroke . The drug has been used by around 2,000 severely affected patients since 2007, when it was approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which rations drugs for the NHS. But NICE claimed in November that Xolair was less affordable and effective than it had thought and announced plans to stop giving the drug to new patients. This provoked an outcry among doctors and patient groups, with Asthma UK campaigning against the proposal. The charity said the drug had led to life-changing improvements by reducing patients’ asthma attacks. Yesterday, NICE confirmed it had reversed its decision and the drug would also be available for children aged six to 11 for the first time. The NHS must fund the drug for eligible patients out of the 14,000 Britons with severe allergic asthma within three months. Xolair is already approved for children and adults in Scotland, and Wales is likely to follow England’s decision. Around 1,000 sufferers die each year, and of these deaths 900 are preventable. The healthcare cost of asthma exceeds £1billion a year, with half the bill spent on the one in ten patients with the worst symptoms. Before Xolair came into use, sufferers of severe asthma had to rely on high doses of powerful steroids that often failed to control symptoms and had serious, long-term side effects. Olympic Team GB swimmer Jo Jackson, who competed in the London games and won a medal at Beijing, has credited the drug with saving her career . The cost of the drug, which is made by Novartis and is also known as omalizumab, ranges from £1,665 to £26,640 a year depending on dose and frequency, with the average at around £8,000 annually. Patients need long-term treatment of between one and four injections every two to four weeks. Dr Samantha Walker, of Asthma UK, said: ‘While it’s not suitable  for everyone, people with severe allergic asthma who benefit from taking Xolair can see a massive improvement in their quality of life. ‘Without it, many would be  virtually housebound because of breathlessness and living in constant fear of the next life-threatening asthma attack.’ Olympic Team GB swimmer Jo Jackson, who competed in the London games and won a medal at Beijing, has credited the drug with saving her career. Dr Robert Niven, senior lecturer in respiratory medicine, University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘Many patients unnecessarily accept the everyday limitations and sudden asthma attacks of severe allergic asthma. ‘This means they are unable to carry out simple everyday tasks such as shopping or working.’","Youngsters aged six to 11 will be able to benefit from Xolair injections for the first time .

A golf club has claimed it is the luckiest green in Britain after six amateur golfers scored a hole in one in two weeks - including one blind player. Bosses at Cleobury Mortimer golf course, in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, were thrilled when a party of golfers reported a hole in one last month. But they were stunned when a further five players, including 12-year-old Jack Severn and blind Arthur Aston, 67, followed suit within just a few days - beating odds of more than a million to one. Six players scored a hole in one at Cleobury Mortimer golf course, in Kidderminster, last month, including a blind man and a 12-year-old boy . Director of Golf, David Pain, said: 'We just couldn't believe it. We normally only get a couple of people who manage a hole in one every year - but to have six in such a short space of time is unheard of. 'We were just amazed that they all seemed to happen one after the other, over the space of 14 days. 'It's such an achievement for any golfer - and most golfers are lucky to experience one in a lifetime. 'The feats were all at different holes which is what is remarkable with all the golfers of a different standard. 'When Arthur came to play we were delighted to accommodate him, we had never had a blind golfer play here before, and then he got a hole in one - we were astounded.' Along with Mr Aston, 12-year-old Jack Severn also managed to score an ace, as well as Mike Stevens, Rick Clayton, Sam Pain, and Bob Rudge, who celebrated his hole-in-one by making a donation to Cancer Research. Blind Arthur Aston (left) beat odds of a million to one when he scored his hole in one, while 12-year-old Jack Severn was also one of the half a dozen players who managed the feat . Four of the aces happened on the same day and started when Mr Clayton struck on the second hole. Mr Stevens then aced the fifth hole on a different run and Mr Pain continued the amazing story with a hole in one on the eighth hole. Mr Aston then stole the show with his effort. Course director Graham Pain said: 'It is just incredible luck we have had here, all of the chaps came here to enjoy themselves on different days and they all couldn't believe it when they got the hole in ones and neither can we. Something crazy is going on.' Mr Aston, 67 from Stourbridge, played a round with his 'buddy' Roy Chapman, 65, and was elated to hear he had beaten odds of a million to one when he scored a hole in one. Bob Rudge (left) celebrated his hole-in-one by making a donation to Cancer Research while Rick Clayton (right) started a run of four hole in ones on the same day when he struck at the second hole . He said: 'It was my first time at the course and, along with my partner Roy, I was able to play as normal, with Roy describing each shot for me and pointing me in the right direction. 'We got to the 8th hole and lo and behold I got a hole in one. I have never had that in my golfing career before I lost my sight so I couldn't quite believe it. 'I actually asked Roy to guide me to the hole so that I could feel it had gone in as I just didn't believe it. I was totally stunned to find out it had.' Mr Chapman said: 'It was a 125-yard uphill hole with a bunker in front of the green. It was a very emotional moment for Arthur when he got it.' Sam Pain (left) scored a hole in one on the eighth hole while Mike Stevens (right) aced the fifth hole on a different run . Mr Aston lost his sight due to a medical condition just over two years ago, but has continued to play golf, thanks to help from Insight Golf, Worcestershire. He was taught how to play again at the Guadetluce course, Droitwich, and received help from professional golfer Russel Adams. Mr Aston said: 'I had never even heard of blind golf before I lost my sight. But once I had come to terms with being blind, I decided I wanted to play again.' Mr Aston had played golf for 12 years before he lost his sight and had never had a hole-in-one when he could see. Bookies William Hill say they would have offered Mr Aston odds of a million to one on him bagging himself a hole in one. Joe Crilly, from William Hill: 'This is one of those rare moments when we can actually offer realistic odds of a million to one.' Stephen Burnett, performance manager of the England Golf squads, said: 'I have never heard of six hole in ones in such a short period of time before. 'It is a fantastic achievement - really against the odds - perhaps they should make the holes a bit smaller. 'With blind golfing you really are at the behest of the person guiding you and describing the shot, there is a bit of luck involve but fair play, very well done. Six in ten days is really good going.'","Four of the golfers got a hole in one on the same day .

An anonymous troll later stole the image, which had been used as the student's profile picture on a number of social media sites, and added the comment: 'That's pretty much what I expected.' Cruel taunt: Kelly Martin Broderick's picture while holding the sign 'This Is What A Feminist Looks Like' was turned into a cruel meme . The meme appeared on a Facebook community page called No Hope For The Human Race which describes itself as: 'The MOST HILARIOUS and FASTEST GROWING page on facebook!!' It also comes with a warning: 'Please don't like our page if you are easily offended or have a hair across your a**! Otherwise, like our page or nobody will ever like you again.' The image was posted on August 19 and has been commented on hundreds of times, ranging from the vulgar and insulting to more supportive remarks. MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the page organizer. Miss Broderick found out about the meme this week after she was contacted by a stranger on . dating website OkCupid who said he had seen her picture online. She was sent a link to the meme which revealed it had been shared 2,000 times, had 10,000 likes and 1,000 comments.

Guilty: Mother-of-three Cheri Makin, 34, has been jailed after falsely claiming £57,061 in housing benefit, council tax benefit and tax credits . A benefits cheat mother who falsely claimed £57,061 has been jailed. Mother-of-three Cheri Makin, 34, admitted claiming housing benefit, council tax benefit and tax credits illegally over four years. Makin, then of Blacon, Chester, failed to declare that she was living with her partner and the father of her children, Paul Carmichael, while she fraudulently claimed the benefits between July 2008 and March 2012, Chester Crown Court heard. Makin, who has since relocated her family to Lincolnshire, was jailed for 12 months. She pleaded guilty to fraud and three counts of failing to notify the Department for Work and Pensions and the former Chester City Council of her change in circumstances. Jailing Makin, the judge Recorder Simon Killeen told her: 'This was a substantial amount of money that you wrongly claimed.' Makin had been convicted of possessing and supplying class B drugs in 2011 and had been sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for two years. The court was told she failed to come clean about her fraudulent claims then because she feared she would end up going straight to prison. Michael Scholes, prosecuting, said there were a number of aggravating features in her case including the multiple benefit fraud, the length of time for which the fraudulent claims were carried out and her earlier drug-related conviction. Judge Killeen told Makin: 'I take in to account your guilty plea and that you are a mother with responsibilities and you have suffered with ill health. 'But effectively this is an offence that has evolved over a period of time, and the aggravating features that you do not have the benefit of good character, you committed these offences whilst serving a suspended sentence for supplying class B drugs.' Makin's defence team said she was remorseful and had not used the monies to fund a luxurious lifestyle . In an act of mercy, Judge Killeen said he had decided not to activate the suspended sentence prison term on top of the 12 month sentence. Simon Christie, defending, said Makin was remorseful and had not used the monies to fund a luxurious lifestyle. He said she had begun to suffer increasingly with ill health during the four-year period in question and had relied on her partner to assist with their three children. 'This defendant has faced numerous difficulties, compounded by the need to put a roof over the head of her three small children,' he said. Makin, who now lives in Lincolnshire, was jailed for 12 months at Chester Crown Court . 'Finances were strained, the monies were used to fund basic household bills and living costs, this is not the case of somebody luxuriating at the taxpayer's expense.' Speaking after the sentencing, Mike O'Grady, assistant director of investigation for HM Revenue and Customs, said: 'Makin lied on numerous occasions to continue to receive benefits she wasn't entitled to, pocketing money needed to fund public services. 'We recognise it is only a minority that are exploiting the system but would encourage anyone with information relating to tax credit fraud to call the benefits anti-fraud Helpline on 0800 854 440 in total confidence.'","Mother-of-three Cheri Makin claimed a raft of benefits she wasn't entitled to .

But investigators later found a message on a phone belonging to law student Carberry, 21, in which he offered to pay 'a grand' for 'someone to do a crash', according to prosecutors. It emerged that Gray, 26, obtained the car for Hamilton, 36, while Carberry arranged the coach and the group booking to the dog track, then Hamilton purposefully drove the car into the coach. Carberry and Gray became friends through travelling to Everton games, according to the prosecution, while Gray knew Hamilton as he had lived close to him at a previous address. Gray, from Fazakerley, Carberry, from Liverpool city centre, and Hamilton, from Norris Green, each admitted one count of conspiring to commit fraud together with others unknown when they appeared yesterday at Southwark Crown Court. A fourth suspect, Joe Hindley, 22, was charged but found not guilty after the prosecution offered no evidence against him. The prosecution says Carberry sent a text to another passenger on the coach saying: 'Need someone to do a crash. Do you know anyone? Paying a grand.' Carberry had not missed an Everton home or away game in years and regularly arranged coaches for travelling fans. On this trip, the prosecution says, he paid coach driver Paul Woodruff when he picked up the men, all aged between 18 and 25, at The Mons pub in Bootle. Twenty minutes into the journey, Mr Woodruff slowed down to give way at a roundabout and, as he continued on to it, passengers shouted for him to stop. Having pulled over, Mr Woodruff got off and saw Hamilton and a man alleged to be Gray, who pulled a hoodie over his head and walked away, the prosecution says. Court: The trio pleaded guilty to the fraud yesterday at Southwark Crown Court, pictured . Mr Woodruff saw that there was minor damage to the vehicles and exchanged details with Hamilton.He later gave his passengers a piece of paper on which to write their details if they were injured. But he noted that all the passengers on the coach wrote their names to say they were injured, then was amused to see them all run across the dual carriageway and into the pub after arriving back in Bootle. Unemployed Hamilton later claimed he was driving to see his cousin to deliver Christmas presents when the collision happened. He told police he crashed into the coach at 30mph because he was distracted by the car's fuse box, which was attached with Blu Tack and had fallen off. Fans: Carberry and Gray became friends over years of attending Everton matches at Goodison Park, pictured . Hamilton later told police that Gray bought the Megane for him for about £300 and arranged the insurance after he had asked for help with this because he was not confident on the phone and did not know how to use the internet - even though he had a Facebook account. When the men were arrested, Mr Hindley admitted that the collision was 'pre-arranged and staged', according to prosecutors. The 30 claims for whiplash were worth up to £5,000 each, bringing the cost up to a maximum of £150,000. The three men will appear in court at a later date for sentencing.","Ben Carberry, Liam Gray and Kevin Hamilton plead guilty to fraud charges .

Payback: Tory MP Nadine Dorries is to return £3,000 in expenses after an investigation by a Commons watchdog . Outspoken Tory MP Nadine Dorries has repaid £3,000 in travel expenses after accepting that the claims were ‘wrongfully made and should not have been allowed’. She admitted the money was to make between Westminster and her Mid Bedfordshire constituency for family reasons and a sick pet dog, and not in connection with her job as an MP. Today she renewed her call for MPs’ expenses ‘to be scrapped in their entirety’. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) launched an investigation in Miss Dorries’s expenses earlier this year after noticing an ‘unusual’ pattern of claims. While it found the travel claims were outside the rules, complaints about expense claims for utility bills were dismissed after compliance officer Peter Davis ruled it would be ‘disproportionate’ to penalise the MP further after making ‘no finding’ about how much time she spent at her London accommodation. A preliminary report by the expenses watchdog was posted on the Ipsa website today. An Ipsa spokesman said: ‘‘As part of the regular review of all MPs' claims, Ipsa's internal assurance function found that Nadine Dorries MP's pattern of travel and accommodation claims were unusual, and were referred to the compliance officer for investigation. ‘The compliance officer for Ipsa has concluded his investigation into claims made by Ms Dorries for accommodation and travel and subsistence under the third and fourth editions of the scheme. ‘The compliance officer has found that claims made by Ms Dorries were outside the scheme, and that these claims should be repaid. Ms Dorries has subsequently repaid these claims.’ The three allegations included: . The report said Ms Dorries did not contest the details of her travel claims but said she outlined several explanations for the other allegations, including family commitments and family illness, and an elderly pet dog. Jungle: The Mid Bedfordshire MP was suspended from the Tory party after appearing on ITV's I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here without asking for permission . Outlining Ms Dorries' evidence, the report said: ‘Whilst undertaking her parliamentary duties, the MP and a dependent family member used the premises during the period when utility bills increased. ‘Ms Dorries is a single parent with an elderly pet dog and a dependent family. During the period subject of the complaint, the MP returned to her constituency home to attend to family commitments, including times when a family member and the pet dog suffered illness. ‘At the time of taking out a 12-month . lease on her current Ipsa-funded property, Ms Dorries was not able to . predict her level of occupancy and viewed its use as the most effective . way of facilitating her parliamentary function.’ It . added: ‘Ms Dorries believes that she has acted within the principles of . the scheme and that there has been no deliberate wrongdoing.’ The outspoken backbencher has already announced she will no longer claim expenses . In a statement posted on her website, Ms Dorries questioned why Ipsa had chosen to carry out an ‘expensive and time-consuming investigation into my expenses’. And the MP, who was suspended from the Conservative Parliamentary Party after she appeared on TV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, added: ‘I am sure it is just a coincidence that, as the pressure began to mount for my whip to be returned after three months of suspension, wham, I surprisingly had an investigation in process. ‘Any request for reinstatement met with the response from the Chief Whip (Sir George Young): 'We now have to wait for the Ipsa investigation to end'.’ Ms Dorries said she was ‘delighted’ that Ipsa had made no findings against her, noting that she could have legitimately made more claims than she had. Her statement said any overpayments were due to a ‘technical breach which was Ipsa's fault’. ‘They were wrongfully claimed on Ipsa's explicit instructions to claim and then wrongfully paid by Ipsa,’ she said. Ms Dorries claimed that Ipsa had failed to pay her £6,000 of salary and failed to mention this in the provisional report, blaming ‘total incompetence’ at the organisation. She said she believed Ipsa needed fundamental reform leading to the abolition of MPs' expenses. ‘Anyway, as everyone knows, I have removed myself from the personal expenses system. I shall use my salary to fund my second home in Westminster and my travel and all other personal expenses, which in effect means I shall be working for free,’ she said. ‘When we had the expenses crisis in 2009, the problem was never who paid the expenses, it was expenses. Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg thought that the answer to the problem, was to change the people who paid the expenses from the fees office to IPSA. ‘Expenses need to be scrapped in their entirety.’","Commons watchdog issues ruling on Mid Bedfordshire MP .

Abu Qatada claims his prison uniform breaches his human rights because it is too uncomfortable . Hate preacher Abu Qatada has claimed that his prison uniform breaches his human rights because it is too uncomfortable. The terror suspect, deported from Britain to face trial in his native Jordan, has made a formal complaint about the clothes at his new high-security prison. Inmates at Muwaqqar prison wear beige zip-up jackets with matching beige trousers. Qatada, 53, asked to wear a traditional flowing dishdash robe, but was ordered to don the ‘uncomfortable’ uniform – a decision his lawyer said was one of ‘several violations of his rights’. He also claimed that having his family visits and legal consultations supervised by prison guards was an abuse of his human rights. Qatada – once dubbed Osama Bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe – repeatedly used human rights legislation to thwart his removal from Britain. During a decade-long legal fight which cost taxpayers almost £2million, he claimed he could not have a fair trial on terror charges in Jordan. The radical cleric was deported earlier this month after Jordan signed a treaty saying evidence obtained through torture would not be used against him. Qatada has previously been tried and convicted in his absence, and was sentenced to life imprisonment with 15 years hard labour. His retrial date has yet to be set. Muwaqqar Jail outside Amman (pictured) has 240 solitary confinement cells, but Qatada has been placed in a communal cell, where he will bunk with other inmates . Qatada is currently being held in Muwaqqar Jail outside Amman, where he shares a cell with 15 other inmates. Many of the prisoners have been sentenced or charged with offences against state security. Muwaqqar is known as one of Jordan's best-kept prisons. Colour-coded textbooks and maps are lined up in the prison's libraries and there is a computer room for the inmates.

A shocking letter from child-killer Myra Hindley to the mother of one of her victims has emerged for the first time today . Moors Murderer Myra Hindley wrote to the mother of one of her victims claiming it was ‘deeply upsetting’ to be described as evil, it emerged yesterday. The notorious killer tried to downplay the seriousness of her crimes in an attempt to persuade families to drop a campaign against her release from prison. In a previously unseen letter, she tells Ann West – the mother of ten-year-old victim Lesley Ann Downey – that she was ‘not what I was all those years ago’. ‘I know almost everyone describes me as cold and calculating – “evil Myra” – but I ask you to believe that I find all this deeply upsetting,’ she wrote from jail. Hindley and her lover Ian Brady were responsible for the murders of five children in the 1960s. The victims were sexually tortured and buried on Saddleworth Moor near Manchester. Hindley was jailed for life in 1966 for the murders of Lesley Ann and Edward Evans, 17, plus being an accessory to the murder of 12-year-old John Kilbride by Brady. In 1987, Hindley and Brady confessed to murdering Pauline Reade, 16, and Keith Bennett, 12. One line from the never-before-revealed letter sent by Hindley to victim Lesley Ann Down's mother reads: 'I know almost everyone describes me as cold and calculating - ""evil Myra"" - but I ask you to believe that I find all this deeply upsetting' Moors Murderer Hindley wrote to Ann West (seen right, in 1978) - whose 10-year-old daughter Lesley Ann Downey (left) was one of five children killed by Hindley and Ian Brady in the 1960s - pleading for her family to stop campaigning against her release from prison . Seven months later she wrote to Mrs . West, expressing her ‘deep regret and remorse for all the pain and . heartache’ she had caused. Hindley said Mrs West was ‘quite rightly . fighting so hard against my release from prison’ but said she realised . ‘release from prison is no longer a practical reality’. ‘I have written to the Home Office and . the Parole Board to say I do not wish to be considered for parole in . 1990, and my own belief is that I shall probably remain in prison until I . die.’ The letter was the first, and last, sent to Mrs West by Hindley and was written on September 28, 1987, at Cookham Wood prison in Rochester, Kent . It soon emerged that the letter was a . manipulative attempt to try to stop Mrs West from blocking her release. Within years of the note, Hindley launched another application to be . granted parole, which was refused in 1994. Mrs West continued to . petition the Government to keep Hindley behind bars until her death in . 1999. Hindley died in prison in 2002. Hindley and Brady abducted Lesley Ann . from a fairground on Boxing Day in 1964 and took her to their house in . Hattersley, Manchester. A tape recording and photos they took to capture . Lesley Ann’s final moments were the most damning evidence against . Hindley during her trial. Although Ann West died in 1999, her husband Alan West (both pictured) has continued to ensure the impact of the Moors Murders is widely understood . However, in the letter to Mrs West, . Hindley attempts to play down her role. She wrote: ‘Please believe me – . not for my sake, but simply in the hope that it will give you even a . little peace of mind, that however monstrous and unforgivable the crime . was, your child was not tortured to death.’ The letter features in a . two-part Channel 5 documentary called Myra Hindley: The Untold Story, . the first part of which was screened last night.

Trust in the European Union has collapsed in the wake of the Eurozone crisis, according to a major new survey paid for by Brussels. The poll of more than 32,000 people across Europe found that just 31 per cent of the public now say they trust the EU, with 60 per cent saying they do not. The figures suggest trust in Brussels has almost halved since the Eurozone crisis. In 2007, before the crisis erupted, some 57 per cent of people said they trusted the EU compared to just 32 per cent who said they did not. Trust in the European Union has collapsed in the wake of the Eurozone crisis, according to a major new survey paid for by Brussels . But, although the poll was paid for by the European Commission, the stark findings were not mentioned in a press release it put out on the results. In a release entitled 'A greater dose of optimism', the Commission chose to focus on more positive findings about prospects for the European economy. Instead, the figures revealing the collapse in trust were buried in 200-page report giving a full breakdown on the poll's findings. Vincenzo Scarpetta of the think tank Open Europe, said: 'Despite what the Commission suggests, it is clear that trust in the EU is falling. 'This latest survey exposes the extent of the breakdown between citizens and the EU - particularly in crisis-hit southern eurozone countries, which seem to be losing faith in the EU as a positive counter-balance to unpredictable national politics.' The findings will also bolster David Cameron's drive to reform the EU to reduce meddling by Brussels and make it more accountable to voters. The regular 'Eurobarometer' poll is conducted twice a year on behalf of the Commission. It found that the British public view Brussels with greater mistrust than most of Europe. In the UK, just 20 per cent of people said they had trust in the EU, with 68 per cent saying they do not.

Greece, Spain and Cyprus, which have suffered the disastrous consequences of being in the single currency, all now report lower levels of trust in the EU than Britain. In Cyprus just 13 per cent, which was forced to agree crippling terms in return for a bailout this year, said they trusted the EU, with 83 per cent saying they did not. Across Europe, just 23 per cent of people said they thought things were 'going in right direction' in EU, 49 per cent not. In another damaging finding, a record number of people said they felt their views were ignored by the EU's elite. Just 28 per cent of people said they felt their voice was heard in Brussels, with a record 67 per cent saying it was not. Some 55 per cent of people said they thought the worst of the economic crisis was 'yet to come'. But this was down from a peak of 68 per cent in 2011. And, despite the crisis, the poll found a narrow majority still saying they supported the single currency, with 51 per cent in favour of the euro and 42 per cent against. In the UK, just 15 per cent of people backed the euro, with 79 per cent against. Views on the future of the EU were deadlocked, with 49 per cent saying they are optimistic against 46 per cent saying they are pessimistic.","Figures suggest trust in Brussels has almost halved since Eurozone crisis .

From wonderfully detailed portraits to striking Marimekko style designs, artist Yulia Brodskaya's work might look like the result of careful work with a paintbrush but in this instance, appearances are deceptive. Instead, Brodskaya's intricate creations are made using a technique called 'quilling', which involves using strips of paper that have been rolled and then twisted into shape. 'It takes a couple of days to make the simple designs and a few weeks for more elaborate and complicated pieces such as the portraits,' reveals the Russian artist. Colourful: This cheerful image, featuring a stag, the sea and a forest, is reminiscent of Marimekko prints . Incredible: Yulia's wonderful work looks like was created with oil paint rather than strips of paper . With a background in origami and a degree in graphic communication, quilling wasn't in Brodskaya's early plans but she says that when she finally discovered it, it was love at first try. 'I started to use it about five years ago,' she explains. 'I was planning to create a small brochure with my hand-drawn illustrations to be sent out to potential clients and I was looking for an eye-catching image with my name (Yulia) for the cover. 'I created a number of hand-drawn variants, but I didn’t like any of them and then I remembered an image from some school book showing a paper strips standing on edge and tried to make the letters using this technique. 'The attempt was successful and over the next couple months I switched to quilling completely.' Quilling itself dates back to the Renaissance when it was used by monks and nuns in France and Italy to decorate book covers.

Later, it became popular as a hobby during the 18th century, when it was considered an appropriate pastime for gentlewomen. After years in decline, the art form resurfaced in the 1980s when quilling became hugely popular with enthusiastic children in search of a hobby. 'My mum got interested in quilling after seeing my work so now she practices it as a hobby and makes presents for friends,' adds Yulia. While few laymen will manage to hit the heights achieved by Yulia, she does have some tips for those who would like to take up the craft.

To head off unwanted advances, women should avoid an 'upward inflection' when speaking, learn to accept compliments gracefully and imagine their grandmother was in the room during interaction with male colleagues. This advice doesn't come from the pages of a 50s etiquette guide, but courtesy of an employee education and training service used by companies such as Groupon, Google, Eventbrite and Ask.com. The service responsible, Jhanaeducation.com, recently published the article, entitled: 'What if a male colleague gets the wrong idea?' An employee education and training service used by the likes of Groupon and Google has published an article instructing women on how not to lead men on in the workplace . And it's enraged some women. Writing on Jezebel, Erin Gloria Ryan, who spotted the feature, said: 'The problem with the piece - besides the fact that it treats its target audience like actual sex idiots - is that it once again implies that women are responsible for how men behave and what men think.' Tips include avoiding 'revealing clothing' and the manual states: 'If you’re touchy-feely or flirtatious by nature, you might want to dial it back around him and any guys from whom you sense discomfort.' 'If you’d feel embarrassed saying or doing whatever you’re about to say or do in front of Grandma, don’t go there' The article discusses how the way women dress can affect their position in the workplace: 'In a perfect world, women would feel . free to dress however they want without being stigmatized for it.' 'Know that revealing clothing and certain verbal tics, such as ending . statements with an upward inflection in your voice or struggling to . accept a compliment, can affect others’ ability to take you seriously.' And apparently the greatest weapon a woman has against inadvertent flirting is her grandmother: 'Don’t say or do anything you wouldn’t say or do in the presence of . your grandmother. If you sense that you could start unconsciously . flirting (you’re human, and sometimes it happens), imagine that your . grandmother is in the room. 'If you’d feel embarrassed saying or doing whatever you’re about to say or do in front of Grandma, don’t go there.' And it even provides tips for when the male in question doesn't quite get the hint. 'If he still doesn't get the message, socialize in groups, especially after hours and outside the office. The article states that revealing clothing can affect others' ability to take you seriously . 'There's a greater chance that the guy will misinterpret your behaviour in 1-on-1 situations that happen outside the office. 'Leave when everyone else does. And try to avoid letting him pick up the tab.' The manual instructs women to use their 'creep-o-meter' to determine whether the man is getting the wrong message. 'Always . pay attention to your creep-o-meeter. Every woman has one. If you get . even a faint whiff of creepiness off of the guy or anyone else at work, . ask yourself if it's really worth trying to know the person. In most . cases, it isn't.' It . concludes with: 'Still confused? You should be.

They are accused of being part of a gang of as many as 10 men who raped their victim on June 29, while the others allegedly filmed the attacks with cellphone cameras.

A third man, Donald Ray Lewis, 49, has now been arrested in connection with the incident, reports FoxNews. Lewis is accused of assaulting the girl in a separate attack hours later, according to an arrest affidavit. Investigators said the girl left the apartment where the initial gang rape took place and went to ‘smoke crack’ with a woman she just met at another nearby apartment on June 30. Lewis met the unidentified victim at that apartment, the affidavit said.

A Utah man has been arrested for murder nearly a year after he allegedly shot his wife in the head then faked a frantic 911 call and blamed an unidentified black man for the killing. Police say Conrad Truman, 31, killed his 25-year-old wife Heidy at the end of September in a bid to collect her life insurance policy - valued at more than $878,000. Authorities say Truman threatened 911 dispatchers and responding medics and police officers who arrived at the couple's suburban home in Orem, Utah, but did nothing help resuscitate his dying wife. Scroll down to hear the 911 call . Busted: Conrad Truman, 31, was arrested in his wife's 2012 murder nearly ten months after she was fatally shot . Tragic: Police say Conrad Truman pressed a pistol against his wife Heidy's head and shot her at point blank range in their suburban Utah home. She was 23 . From the beginning Truman's stories were inconsistent and full of holes, investigators say. Still, it took Orem police nearly ten months to charge him with Heidy's murder, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. Before his arrest during a traffic stop on Friday, Truman was a free man. Detectives say it took them until now to gather all of the evidence against Truman in order to charge him. Police say that Truman pressed his Sig Sauer .380-caliber pistol against Heidy's head and shot her at point blank range in the couple's kitchen. He then called 911 and gave a frantic description of his wife's death to dispatchers. 'There's so much blood. If they don't get here right now, she's gonna die,' he wails. Truman, pictured in blue, was arrested during a traffic stop on Friday after police received a warrant for his arrest following an extensive investigation . Heidy had life insurance policies totaling more than $878,000 at the time of her death - with all of the money payable to her husband . 'I don't know what happened. I really don't know what happened, I swear to God. She was in the shower, she came out of the shower and I heard a pop, and there's blood, and she's in blood.' Later, he shouts 'If you don't get here quick, my wife's life is on your head. My wife.' When officers arrived, he was covered in blood and gave several explanations of what had happened. One story he told officers was that an unidentified black man had shot her through a window while she was taking a bath. She then stumbled, naked, into the kitchen where she died. 'Conrad said he saw a black male run out of the home just before Heidy was shot. Conrad said Heidy may have been shot through the window or wall in the shower, and she was murdered,' according to the police report. He also said that she may have shot herself. Forensic evidence, however, did not match either of those explanations, according to police. When officers later tried to question Truman at his workplace after he failed to return their phone calls for weeks, he refused to speak to them. 'You have questions, well they can wait until I'm ready. I don't know nothing man,' he fumed. He is being held on $1million cash bail, charged with first degree murder and obstruction of justice.","Conrad Truman was a free man for 10 months following the September killing of his wife Heidy .

Jennifer Whiteley, 27, died after apparently taking the so-called 'legal high' Benzo Fury: Her family paid tribute to her as 'a wonderful person loved by everyone' A talented trainee psychologist has died after taking a party drug that was outlawed less than a month ago. Jennifer Whiteley, 27, was taken ill after sniffing a drug called Benzo Fury - a former ‘legal high’ which was temporarily banned by the Government last month over health fears. The former A-star Catholic girls' school pupil was rushed to hospital but suffered a heart attack and died shortly afterwards. Detectives originally believed she may have taken a pink Ecstasy-type tablet from a rogue batch feared to have killed 11 other people but officers recovered Benzo Fury powder from her home in Sale, Greater Manchester. Yesterday, as police issued a warning over the dangers of party drugs, her family paid tribute to the blonde Masters graduate who was setting out on a career in psychology. She was working as a mental health carer and had seen her articles published in the Journal of Health Psychology. In a statement her distraught family last night said their daughter was a ‘young, caring and beautiful woman.’ The family said: ‘Jennifer was passionate about her field of study and wanted to help people wherever she could. You could put her with a group of people covering every age, creed and colour and she could engage with all of them. ‘The overwhelming response from all the people who knew her, is that this young, caring and beautiful woman was a wonderful person loved by everyone and her loss will affect them all deeply.’ The tragedy unfolded in the early hours of Saturday morning when Miss Whiteley collapsed after taking the amphetamine-type drug 6-APB at her home. It is thought she and her boyfriend both attended a hospital after suffering an adverse reaction to the drug. Miss Whiteley died from a heart attack though her boyfriend recovered and later discharged himself after receiving treatment. Jennifer obtained an MSc in health psychology from Staffordshire University. She collapsed early Saturday at home after taking banned party drug . Police said officers were now awaiting toxicology results to establish how Jennifer died. In the statement her family said that growing up Miss Whiteley was an exceptional pupil achieving 11 GCSEs, including 3A*, 2 A-levels and three AS levels. She went on to Manchester Metropolitan University where she obtained a 2.2 BSc Honours degree in psychology and subsequently an MSc in health psychology from Staffordshire University. Detective Inspector Frank Morris said: ‘We will not be able to confirm the cause of this woman’s death until we get toxicology results. However, we recovered a powder which is a ‘legal high’ known as Benzo Fury, the legality of which is the subject of ongoing attention by the relevant authorities. ‘Taking drugs can not only have dire consequences for the person taking them but also for their family and friends.’ Benzo Fury, a mild stimulant that acts like amphetamines, is one of two legal highs which was banned for one year by the government last month. Announcing the temporary ban Home Office minister Jeremy Browne said it was being done to ‘protect the public’ and prevent ‘misery’. They have banned Benzo Fury and another legal high NBOMe while the government’s advisory council on the misuse of drugs assesses whether the ban should be made permanent.","The former A-star Catholic girls' school pupil suffered a heart attack and died shortly afterwards .

'Highly regarded': Sir David Higgins, who was knighted in 2011, is likely to walk away from Railtrack with a severance pay and bonus pot of £1million . The Network Rail boss at the centre of bitter rows over fat cat executive bonuses, poor punctuality and overcrowded trains is to quit. Chief executive Sir David Higgins intends to leave next year, and is likely to walk away with a severance pay and bonus pot worth up to £1million. Senior Whitehall sources insist he was not ‘pushed’ and stressed that Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin was disappointed  at the departure of the ‘highly regarded’ boss. However, union sources hinted at internal squabbles suggesting that Sir David had simply ‘had enough’ with the politics and constant  public rows over large bonuses and poor performance of the railways. Last week the Daily Mail revealed how Sir David, who was knighted in 2011, and four other Network Rail directors could be paid more than £11million over the next three years – £5million of it in bonuses if they meet performance targets. Unions condemned the potential pay-outs as ‘rewards for failure’. Sir David, 58, who has served as chief executive since February 2011, is planning to step down within a year. Taxpayer-funded Network Rail declined to specify the terms of his contract, though rail experts said departing bosses stand to pick up between six months and a year’s salary. Network Rail missed all of its passenger train punctuality targets in 2012-13 and has been warned by watchdogs that it is steaming towards a £75million fine by spring next year over fears it will miss future punctuality targets for long-distance services. Its debts have also soared to £30 billion. Sir David’s package currently includes annual bonuses worth up to 60 per cent of his £577,000 a year salary, or £346,200 a year. He also stands to make up to 100 per cent of his £577,000 annual salary under a long-term incentive plan which pays out in April 2015, however Network Rail said he would relinquish that element of any pay out if he does leave before that date. Last year, following political pressure, rail bosses, including Sir David, waived their six-figure bonus packages and instead allocated them to a safety programme. Network Rail chairman Richard Parry-Jones had asked Sir David to stay in post for the bulk of the next five year funding period, but he declined. Sir David then agreed with the board that he would make way for a successor as part of ‘an entirely amicable departure,’ said sources. Sir David originally joined the Network Rail board as a non-executive director in April 2010, after running the body responsible for preparing for the London Olympics. A train makes its way into Victoria station: Network Rail missed all of its passenger train punctuality targets in 2012-13 and has been warned by watchdogs that it is steaming towards a £75million fine by spring next year . Network Rail was created by Labour in 2002 after it pulled the plug on private sector Railtrack. The not for dividend company, which has 'members' instead of shareholders receives £3.5billion taxpayer subsidy a year, which represents just over half its total income, with the rest from fare-payers or borrowings. Its current five year budget is £35billion, or £7billion a year. It is seeking from the Government a budget of £37billion for its next five year period. Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union hinted last night at internal tensions saying Sir David ‘had done a good job in difficult circumstances’ and would be ‘a hard act to follow.’ Mr Cortes said: ‘Sir David Higgins has done a good job in turning Network Rail around after the difficulties experienced under the previous regime. 'He removed its bullying culture and placed a new emphasis on safety which had been sadly lacking. He was not afraid to take on the “old guard” who wanted things to remain the same. ‘He was slowly restoring the company’s reputation and we would have liked him to stay around to finish the job he had started.’","Senior Whitehall sources insist that Sir David Higgins was not 'pushed'

With their squeaking and their furry coat, the guinea pig is a common pet in many back gardens throughout Britain. But centuries ago this hairy little creature was a highly exotic creature from South America - and much sought after in aristocratic circles. Now art experts think they have uncovered one of the first ever portraits of a guinea pig as a pet. Prized pet: The little-known painting is called 'Three Unknown Elizabethan children' and could well be the first portrait of a guinea pig being cradled in the arms of one of three children . The little-known 16th century oil painting showing the animal being cradled between three children will go on show at a new exhibition later this year. The portrait, believed to have been painted around 1580 by an unknown artist, shows three young children holding the animal which had recently been introduced into Europe from South America by Spanish merchants. It will form part of an exhibition, called Elizabeth I And Her People, which opens at the National Portrait Gallery in central London in October. A gallery spokesman said: 'We know that guinea pigs were introduced into Europe by traders and were kept as exotic pets. Tasty: The Last Supper by Zapata, in the Cuzco Cathedral shows the platter in front of Jesus holding a very large roasted guinea pig regarded as a delicacy and were highly regarded for their taste . 'While archaeological finds for domestic . guinea pigs in Europe are rare, a partial skeleton of one that dates . from around 1575 was discovered at Hill Hall in Essex, an Elizabethan . manor house.' The youngest child in the painting is also holding a small bird, possibly a goldfinch, which was often used to symbolise Christianity in works of the period. The inclusion of such exotic animals indicates how Elizabethan England was a period of great exploration around the world. Food, products, animals and influences from around the world were brought to the country, where a curious public were eager to discover new and exciting things from other countries. While guinea pig might have been seen as prized pets in Europe, in South America they were highly regarded for their taste. On show: The exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery (pictured) seeks to show more exotic animal appearances such as an elephant on a crest and an intricate purse made in the shape of a frog . Painter Marcos Zapata (1710 –1773), who was based in the Peruvian city of Cuzco, paid tribute to the highly sought-after animal in his interpretation of the Last Supper, Art In Society said. Instead of meat or fish, the platter in front of Jesus and his disciples bears a very large roasted guinea pig, in the 1755 painting . Guinea pigs are native to the South American country and are still regarded as a great culinary delicacy. They are commonly found on restaurant menus, kept and bred in a similar manner to chickens, and consumed on festive occasions. The exhibition includes jewellery, costumes and coins from the period as well as paintings.

Tourism bosses are to use the birth of Prince George of Cambridge to present Britain as a family friendly holiday destination. VisitBritain released the first poster which will be used in the campaign to target 21 key markets around the world. They hope to build on the £500million annual boost the royal family brings to the economy, after images of the royal baby were beamed around the world. Attraction: Tourism bosses hope to use the royal birth to advertise Britain as a family-friendly destination . The new campaign will feature the slogan ‘welcome to Great Britain’ over an iconic image of William and Kate with their new son, named George Alexander Louis, on the steps of St Mary’s hospital. The poster adds: ‘Many congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on the birth of their baby boy.’ The image will be used in online and print campaigns around the world, after VisitBritain chief executive Sandy Dawe said the arrival of the royal baby ‘gives us chance to promote family-friendly Britain’. Key countries to be targeted include USA, Canada, Brazil, Australia, China, Japan, India, UAE, Germany, France, Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Poland, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Norway  and Russia. News of the royal birth has made headlines around the world, with images of the Duke and Duchess dominating front pages in many of the countries targeted by tourism agencies. Within hours of the birth Visit Britain began highlighting parts of the UK with links to the couple in an attempt to encourage visitors to book holidays days to areas with royal connections. It included promoting Norfolk, because Anmer Hall, a few miles east of the Queen’s grand Norfolk estate, Sandringham, will be William and Kate’s new country retreat. Other areas with William and Kate connections including Eton, where he went to school, St Andrews university in Edinburgh where they met as students and the Welsh island of Anglesey where they live while Williiam served as a pilot. Long life: In Kate's arms, the baby gurgled, then appeared to wave as he made his debut in front of the world's media . Special moment: Prince William and Kate waved and smiled broadly as they carried their son out of hospital, but they are yet to decide on a name . A VisitBritain spokesman said: ‘William and Kate have really given us a great romance of Britain – meeting at St Andrews, living on Anglesey and now preparing for life at Kensington Palace and in Norfolk. ‘With the birth of the Prince of Cambridge, we’re looking to highlight Britain globally as a great family destination, with plenty of kid friendly activities as well as plenty for older generations to enjoy.’ Three years ago a study by VisitBritain suggested Britain’s Monarchy generated well over £500 million a year from overseas tourists. But since then the royals’ global profile has soared through Kate and William’s wedding, the Diamond Jubilee, the Queen’s appearance in the opening ceremony of the London Olympics and now the royal baby. Branding agency Brand Finance this week suggested the new royal prince could bolster the British economy by £521million. It claimed short-term boosts like souvenirs, memorabilia, food and drink sales combined with longer-term benefits including sales of pushchairs and clothing, will rake in millions alongside a wider sense of consumer confidence. David Haigh, chief executive of Brand Finance, said: ‘The monarchy is one of the most valuable of all British brands. Whatever one thinks about the constitutional principle, there seems little doubt that the institution of Monarchy adds significant annual earnings and long term economic value to the UK. ‘The Monarchy is a powerful endorsement for individual and company brands and the latest Windsor will be an effective and lucrative ambassador for Brand Britain, making a significant contribution to the task of driving Britain out of the recession.’","VisitBritain unveils artwork featuring Kate and William with baby Prince .

A teenager has filmed the dramatic moment a stray firework exploded on the road in front of him and almost knocked him off his motorcycle. Joe Furness was showered with sparks and his bike was left with burn marks when the explosive went off unexpectedly. The explosion was captured on a helmet camera worn by the 18-year-old - the first time he had ever used the technology after borrowing it from a friend. Dramatic: Joe Furness filmed video of a stray firework exploding in the road in Manchester . Danger: Sparks flew and burned the teenager's motorbike, but luckily no one was seriously hurt in the incident . The gap-year student was travelling through Manchester from a friend's house when the firework shot out from a restaurant where some people were celebrating a wedding. It exploded under a bus on the opposite side of the road to Joe, and nearly sent him off his silver Yamaha scooter. The vehicle was left with burn marks on its paintwork and tyres - but the teenager says he is lucky he was not badly injured. Joe, who is due to study law and criminology at Manchester University, had been for a curry with a friend in the Cheetham Hill area and was returning to his home in Mossley. Lucky: Joe had never worn a helmet camera before capturing video of the exciting explosion . The firework which disrupted his journey was apparently not fired deliberately, but was let off from a restaurant on the route. On the video it can be seen arching across the road and landing under a bus travelling in the opposite direction before exploding under the vehicle's engine. A shower of sparks then fall over Joe and his scooter. 'I had just turned left onto Cheetham Hill Road when I heard a wooshing noise and saw the firework,' he said. Student: The 18-year-old is planning to study at Manchester University after taking a gap year . 'I looked round then looked right and it exploded under the bus. I had a helmet on but was only wearing a t-shirt on so could feel the sparks burning on my skin. 'Unfortunately it's left burn marks on my scooter but I am just glad I wasn't a second ahead or it could have gone right into me. 'It was the first time I'd borrowed a helmet cam though and to catch that on it is quite cool.

A rabbit hunter died after being shot in the head when his shotgun trigger snagged on the zip of his boot, an inquest has heard. Father-of-two Carl Rubisch, 30, died of a single gunshot wound after the gun fired as he got out of a Land Rover to shoot a rabbit. He and friend Stuart Forrest, 30, were on an organised night-time shooting trip on farmland near Brockton, Shropshire, when the tragedy happened. Father-of-two Carl Rubisch, pictured with wife Fay, died from a single gunshot wound during a rabbit hunt . Mr Forrest told the inquest he turned the lights off on his Land Rover before using a powerful torch after spotting a rabbit 80 yards away. He said: 'I stepped out of the vehicle and Carl went to get out. 'I . then heard a shot and looked around and realised something was wrong. Carl was standing by the Land Rover door, he turned to look at me and . let out a groaning sound. 'Carl . then slipped and was lying on his back. I asked him where he had been . hit but he did not respond, so I put him in the recovery position and . went to get help.' Tribute: These flowers were left on farmland in Brockton where Mr Rubisch is believed to have accidentally shot himself during the hunt . Desperate: Mr Rubisch's friend ran to a nearby house to call the emergency services but paramedics could not save him . After the gun went off Mr Forrest ran to a nearby house and the homeowner dialled 999 but paramedics were unable to save Mr Rubisch, who died at the scene . Shooting expert Robert Griffiths told the hearing that Mr Rubisch probably accidentally killed himself during the incident on April 5. He said: 'I fired the firearm a . number of times during testing and found the trigger pull was lighter . than expected, at 500g, but not necessarily dangerous. 'I . was called to examine Mr Rubisch’s Wellington boot that had a zipper, . which was near the top, more or less done up and sticking out at 90 . degrees. 'I carried out a series of tests, . rubbing the rifle up against the boot, and found it was possible for the . zip to engage with the handle and fire the gun. Sad: Neighbours near the family home in Lichfield, Staffordshire where the couple lived with their two children, said they had been married for under a year and Mrs Rubisch was 'inconsolable' at losing her 'soul mate' 'I . have come across similar incidents with police or the soldier equipment . where triggers have been caught, but I have not come across this . before.' Recording a verdict of accident death, John Ellery, coroner for mid and north Shropshire, said: 'Mr Rubisch was clearly an experienced sportsman and rifle shot, who was safety conscious. 'He had no worries or problems and had simply gone out hunting with his friend. 'The accident happened within moments of him getting out of the Land Rover to take a shot. 'What I am left with following the reconstruction is the trigger was accidentally activated by the zip. Liked: Friends said Mr Rubisch was a 'happy go lucky guy' 'That explains the entry point and the . path of the bullet. It’s plausible and fits the evidence. The path of . the bullet also followed the tragic set of circumstances.' Shooting enthusiast Carl leaves behind a widow, Fay, 29, and two young children, Callum and Phoebe. The couple only got married in June last year. Mr Rubisch was a keen shooting fan and was a member of the British Falconers Club which was set up to preserve ancient field sports of hunting with trained birds of prey. The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death. Fay, . who married Mr Rubisch in June last year, was described as being . inconsolable after losing her 'best friend and soul mate'. One . resident, who did not wish to be named, said: 'Carl loved his shooting - . just like his father who is a member of the British Falconers Club. 'I couldn't believe it when I heard what had happened. He is a sensible lad so I can't imagine they were messing around. 'I've seen Fay and she seems absolutely inconsolable.

When Bruce Springsteen played the first ever gig at the £60million Leeds Arena last night, it was supposed to be a landmark event for the cultural life of Britain's third-largest city. But one jobsworth council employee was determined to deflate the celebratory atmosphere - by slapping parking tickets on The Boss's tour trucks outside the venue. City officials - who have keenly promoted the historic concert - have been hugely embarrassed by the blunder, and have agreed to let Mr Springsteen's entourage off the fines they would have accrued. Hard at work: A parking attendant was pictured writing a ticket for Bruce Springsteen's tour trucks . The moment was captured yesterday afternoon when a parking attendant was photographed writing a ticket for the huge articulated lorries. The trucks were parked on double yellow lines outside the venue at the north end of the city centre. Leeds City Council today stood up for the worker, saying he was just doing his job - but a spokesman acknowledged that the incident had left officials red-faced. 'We accept this is a little embarrassing but, to be fair, the attendant was doing his job - if a little too efficiently,' he said. Gig: The Boss is the first artist ever to perform at the £60million Leeds Arena, a major project for the city . 'These were somewhat unusual circumstances with a very large tour involving a tight turnaround of vehicles arriving from the previous night's show in Cardiff on the opening night of a brand new venue. 'The parking tickets were legitimately issued as the area concerned had double-yellow lines and was outside the agreed area for trucks to park to access the arena. 'Having considered the special circumstances, the tickets were quickly cancelled. 'When you prepare a city to open and host a huge, state-of-the-art new venue, you're bound to get the odd teething trouble. 'This was the only slight problem on a historic night for Leeds as the months and years of planning came together to put on an incredible show which everyone who was there will never forget.' Landmark: The arena is the first major music venue to be built in Britain's third-largest city . One bystander told the Yorkshire Evening Post: 'A couple of jobsworths have come down here - the stick they have got from people is hilarious. 'They are not parked illegally, they are just parked down a side street.' Even though Leeds is the third-largest city in the country, with a population of 750,000, it rarely receives visits from the biggest musical acts because it lacks a large arena such as those in Sheffield, Manchester and Nottingham. The 13,500-seat Leeds Arena is an attempt to remedy this, and it has already topped a list of 'new venues to watch' in the American magazine Billboard. Mr Springsteen's sell-out appearance last night was the first at the new venue, but the official opening will not be until September, when Sir Elton John plays. The parking ticket is not the first time the New Jersey rocker has fallen foul of British bureaucracy - last year, officials pulled the plug on his concert in London's Hyde Park when he broke the curfew by teaming up with Paul McCartney for a blockbuster encore.","Rocker played first ever gig at Leeds Arena, promoted by local officials .

And while she is known for her love of yoga and regular gym sessions, the Victoria's Secret Angel has also divulged another of her secret health weapons. The 25-year-old tweeted a picture of herself praising her ‘delicious green juice' which she described as 'a great way to start the day.' But what’s behind this mysterious concoction? Along with other super healthy ingredients such as cucumber, kale and parsley, the Japanese wholefood Chlorella is added to the juice. Just juice: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has revealed that she loves Chlorella (like those pictured right) green juices . And it’s not just Rosie who’s caught the Chlorella bug, fellow Victoria’s Secret Angel Miranda Kerr has admitted that she takes Chlorella supplements to keep her skin in check. Chlorella is being dubbed the new Creme De La Mer but without the celebrity price-tag. Enviable figure: As well as regular gym and yoga sessions, Rosie takes the supplement as an added health benefit . It’s an entirely natural and balanced, single-celled, green algae, which, due to combination of nutrients and amino acid abundance, chlorella is linked to healthy nails, skin and hair. Our bodies cannot produce these nutrients, so they must be obtained through diet instead. And the handy tablets forms are much easier to swallow than the nine cups of spinach (270g) you would need for the equivalent iron content or the 32oz steak you’d need to eat for that much B12.

And Rosie's little secret weapon costs a lot less than a pot of luxurious face cream Creme De La Mer.

'Robert Galbraith': Author JK Rowling has spoken about the events surrounding the identity of the real author of crime novel The Cuckoo's Calling - herself . Author JK Rowling has revealed she spent a week practicing the fake signature of her pseudonym, Robert Galbraith - the name she used for her new detective novel. The Harry Potter creator signed a few copies of the book under her pen name, after working on the fake autograph. 'While . we can't verify whether any particular book currently on eBay etc is . genuine, any future books I sign in this way will be authenticated,' she admitted. 'My Robert Galbraith signature is distinctive and consistent; I spent a whole weekend practicing it to make sure,' she said. Miss Rowling also revealed had offers from two TV firms to bring the crime novel to the screen even before she was 'outed'. She was exposed last week after publishing a detective tale, The Cuckoo's Calling, under the name of Robert Galbraith earlier this year. She has denied claims it was a publicity stunt and said her unmasking left her angered, particularly when it emerged that her cover was blown by a senior figure at a legal firm which has represented her in the past. Rowling has now pointed out the book was already gathering interest for adaptations and had sold a respectable number of copies. But she said it was becoming 'increasingly complicated' to keep the charade going. She said: 'At the point I was 'outed', Robert had sold 8,500 English language copies across all formats (hardback, eBook, library and audiobook) and received two offers from television production companies. 'The situation was becoming increasingly complicated, largely because Robert was doing rather better than we had expected him to, but we all still hoped to keep the secret a little longer. 'Yet Robert's success during his first three months as a published writer (discounting sales made after I was found out) actually compares favourably with JK Rowling's success over the equivalent period of her career.' Hit: Since the revelation, sales of the book have soared and the printers of the book, Clays, have had to start reprinting the book in large numbers . Rowling reiterated that her exposure . was not part of a clever marketing campaign to boost sales and she had . gone to great lengths to continue under the guise. Writing . on a website set up for Galbraith, she said: 'If anyone had seen the . labyrinthine plans I laid to conceal my identity (or indeed my . expression when I realised that the game was up), they would realise how . little I wanted to be discovered. 'I hoped to keep the secret as long as possible. I'm grateful for all the feedback from publishers and readers, and for some great reviews. 'Being Robert Galbraith has been all about the work, which is my favourite part of being a writer. Rowling, who found fame with the Harry Potter novels, said she had found the experience of writing as Galbraith 'liberating' 'This . was not a leak or marketing ploy by me, my publisher or agent, both of . whom have been completely supportive of my desire to fly under the . radar. 'If sales were what mattered to me most, I would have written under my own name from the start, and with the greatest fanfare.' Legal firm Russells offered an . unreserved apology to the author last week after it found that one of . its partners had been the source of the leak after he told his wife's . best friend in 'confidence' about Galbraith's true identity.

Patricia Kent, 71, of Writtle in Essex, was spotted working at Tesco - despite claiming disability benefits. She was secretly filmed on a phone camera strolling down the aisles and working the tills . A great-grandmother who claimed it took her a minute to hobble five yards with a crutch has been jailed for four months after she was found holding down a hectic job at a supermarket. Patricia Kent, 71, began claiming disability benefits 13 years ago after suffering from minor illnesses. But two years later, without informing officials, she began working a 28-hour week at Tesco, a court heard. She held her job behind the tills until December last year, cheating the taxpayer out of £32,000. The sprightly checkout assistant’s life of fraud only ended when investigator Paul Carlisle from the Department for Work & Pensions received a tip-off about her. He filmed her on three occasions marching from her car into the store in Chelmsford, Essex and walking briskly round the aisles unaided. He also saw her processing goods at the tills. Judge Christopher Ball QC told Kent, who was convicted of benefit fraud: 'You could have been forgiven if you acknowledged your dishonesty. 'But you brazenly, in front of the jury, refused to accept how much your condition had improved.' He said at Chelmsford Crown Court that she now accepted she had been wrong. But this confession had come 'too little, too late.' He said: 'It would be the easiest thing in the world to say a 71-year-old in poor health won’t be locked up. 'However, the public need to know, if you cheat for this long in this way, there is a price to pay.' Kent, from Writtle, must also repay the money. The judge added: 'I have seen the . video recording of you walking comfortably from your car, walking . through the store and doing your job - a million miles away from the . claim of walking only a few yards in 60 seconds. Scroll down for video . A tip-off led investigators to follow the great-grandmother round Tesco's camera to prove she was fit to work rather than claim benefits. She has been jailed for four months . 'As a result of your claim, you received enhanced benefits until your cheating was discovered.' Dan Barnes, a spokesman for the DWP, said: 'It is a small minority who aim to defraud the benefit system, but the cheats need to know our investigators are on their tails. 'Our teams follow up calls to the National Benefit Fraud Hotline, check back through old cases for suspect activity and work closely with councils to make sure these criminals are brought to justice.'","Patricia Kent, 71, worked behind tills while cheating taxpayer out of £32,000 .

The infestation is so bad that one resident counted 40 flies in his kitchen and 30 in his dining room, while another local said 150 were found on fly paper that had only been hung three days earlier.

Left: Tom Kirk-Alton, four, holding flypaper from his kitchen and Ray Robson with fly paper from his garage . Industrial fly catching bags are full and environmental health have been contacted over the issue . Local poultry farms have been blamed by some for the problem and the council's environmental health team have now been contacted. At a residents' meeting held to discuss the issue locals said they were keeping doors and windows closed constantly, even on the hottest days. One villager said a blind relative had inadvertently eaten flies which had landed on his food, while a holiday cottage owner said recent visitors would not return to the village because of the problem. Margaret Moffatt, who lives in the village with husband Brian, said: 'Apparently one villager was told that he was ""silly complaining and what did he expect when living in the rural area surrounded by farms"". 'My family has lived in the rural areas far more remote than Finghall and has never experienced the problems we have now.'

Another resident said: 'My wife has given me an ultimatum that we should move out of this area to somewhere they don't have these damn flies.' Some residents blamed nearby poultry farms for the outbreak, which they said had occurred every summer for more than a decade. Richmondshire District Council has been notified about the issue and an officer from the environmental health unit left fly papers with residents. They will be collected after a week and then tested. A spokeswoman said: 'We have spoken to residents and will be investigating.' Local mechanic Ray Robson, 46, said: 'The village have been up in arms about it. Up in arms: Mechanic Ray Robson said 200 flies covered a car he was working on recently . 'There are a lot more flies than normal and where we sit in our bait room we are getting loads of them buzzing around our face. 'When I was working on a car the other day there were around 200 flies covering the car. I don't know whether it is weather related.' Keith Loadman, Richmondshire district councillor, said the problem must be addressed. He said: 'I have known about it for a couple of years - it is so serious in the village that we can't afford to be fobbed off.' Ian Hainsworth, chair of the parish council, added: 'This will not be allowed to drop. 'We will take it forward as forcibly as we can.'","The infestation has reduced villages in Finghall, North Yorkshire, to tears .

Since early 2012, there have been 23,400 more deaths than would have been expected in England and Wales. Posed by model . Health officials are investigating a sudden rise in death rates in the elderly, particularly among women. Around 600 more people – mainly elderly – have died every week so far this year compared with the average for the last five years, official figures show. Since early 2012 there have been 23,400 more deaths than would have been expected in England and Wales. Officials from Public Health England – the new body responsible for monitoring disease – is investigating whether it is due to a particularly aggressive form of new viruses. But other experts believe it may be down to cuts to council care budgets, longer waits in A&E or even the elderly feeling they are a ‘burden’ to society during times of austerity. A report by Public Health England – obtained by Health Service Journal – states that 2013 is on course to be ‘noticeably worse than any recent year’. In recent years, the weekly death rate encompassing all ages groups has been an average of 10,000. However, the numbers of women over 85 who died in 2012 was 5 per cent higher than the average while in men it rose by 3 per cent. Until last year, death rates had been steadily declining due to an overall increase in life expectancy thanks to better standards of living and healthcare. In the first week of July this year, there were about 4,200 deaths in the over 85s, compared with 3,600 for the same weeks in 2010 and 2011. Professor Danny Dorling, who specialises in human geography at Sheffield University, said: ‘Elevated mortality amongst the elderly is often about people dying two or five years earlier than would be expected given recent rates. Often they are people who are quite ill to begin with. Some experts believe the figures may be down to cuts to council care budgets, longer waits in A&E or even the elderly feeling they are a 'burden' to society during times of austerity. Posed by models . ‘It is possible that cuts or freezes to services have a particular bad effect on this group – even cuts and freezes that might appear very minor – because the group is so vulnerable. ‘Increased anxiety resulting from knowing you might have to move home or even have no home has long been known to be very damaging for the health of very elderly people. Officials from Public Health England - the new body responsible for monitoring disease - is investigating whether it is due to a particularly aggressive form of new viruses . ‘The timing of this recent rise in mortality coincides with the crisis in the funding of a large number of care homes. 'It is worth thinking who gets left a little longer in A&E than they were left when there was funding growing year on year. ‘Who is most neglected when the carer visiting them has only 15 minutes when they used to have 30?’ Professor John Ashton, president of the Faculty of Public Health, said that the figures could not be explained as a statistical blip. ‘This is a bell going off that’s saying “There’s something going on here and we need to know something about it”. ‘Is this about the fact that, with people having been living longer and longer, there’s been an accumulation of frail elderly people whose time has finally come? There’s a bit of that. ‘Another potential explanation in part is about antibiotic use and resistance. This is a generation that has had access to antibiotics for decades and maybe they are building up resistance. 'It will no doubt raise questions about access to clinical care among the frail elderly and whether it’s not as good as it was.’ A spokesman for Public Health England said: ‘The number of deaths during 2012-13 was high, especially amongst those aged 85 years and older. 'We are undertaking further work to understand why there was a rise in mortality rates during the earlier months of this year and the causes behind this.'","Since early 2012 there have been 23,400 more deaths than would have been expected in England and Wales .

Hayden Macey, 68, says Miss Westcott decided to ride 'unnecessarily slowly' along the narrow single track during his trial at Exeter Magistrates Court . A hunt protester drove his Land Rover into the back of a £90,000 racehorse during a moorland hunt, a court heard yesterday. The horse’s female rider fell to the ground and had her throat grabbed by the driver, magistrates were told. Hayden Macey, 68, is accused of assaulting huntswoman Michelle Westcott during a meeting of the Mid Devon hunt on Dartmoor. Miss Westcott was riding a horse called According to Lawrence along a steep and narrow lane when the Land Rover started to approach from behind. Prosecutor Sonia Croft said the vehicle was being driven by Mr Macey who was monitoring events as an ‘anti-hunt protester’. She claimed Mr Macey blew his horn before striking the horse in the back of its legs, forcing the animal to move sharply forwards and then jolt sideways. She said: ‘The Land Rover took the opportunity of squeezing past and pinning the horse against a stone wall.’ After the horse reared up and threw Miss Westcott to the ground, he allegedly stopped the vehicle, walked up to the rider and grabbed her by the throat. Giving evidence Miss Westcott said the racehorse was not hers but she was used to riding it. She confirmed that after the incident her leg and arm were injured and she could not put any weight on her leg for two weeks. The  horse’s back was strained. And under cross examination she admitted that she had been walking along the lane rather than ‘trotting or cantering’. However she denied obstructing the track with the horse, which she said was a calm rather than a ‘twitchy’ animal. Another meeting at the Mid Devon Hunt.

Exeter Magistrates Court: protester Mr Macey is appearing at court where he is said to have stopped his Land Rover during a hunt and 'grabbed woman by the throat' Meanwhile Mr Macey accused Miss Westcott of deciding to ride ‘unnecessarily slowly’ along the narrow single track. He told Exeter Magistrates’ Court she was ‘quite deliberately holding us up and delaying us’ as they monitored the hunt. Mr Macey, from Newton Abbot, Devon, said he has been monitoring hunts for the last 30 years up to three times a week. His Land Rover was carrying a number of hunt monitors at the time of the incident. He told magistrates that the  vehicle was stationary when Miss Westcott struck the roof of the car with her whip. And his colleagues said the noise of the whip hitting the roof caused the thoroughbred racehorse to go backwards before rearing up and throwing her to the ground. Mr Macey also denied pinning her and the horse against a stone wall and said he had not been ‘frustrated and aggressive’ when obstructed by the rider. He claimed there was no physical contact at all between him and the rider, and even accused Miss Westcott of verbally abusing him. Mr Macey added: ‘The whole thing is utterly absurd, ridiculous and preposterous. ‘In 30 years I have received black eyes and broken ribs all because I campaign for animals.’ Fellow hunt monitor Sarah Wheeler saw the incident from the back of the vehicle. She told the court that Miss Westcott swore at Mr Macey and raised her riding crop and that the defendant only raised his hands to protect his head. But Miss Westcott stuck to her story when questioned, insisting that she had been trying to pull into a passing place when the driver beeped his car’s horn five times and then struck the horse on the back of its legs. The court also heard that both Mr Macey and Miss Westcott gave differing accounts to police about the incident. Mr Macey denies assaulting Miss Westcott and failing to report an accident.

Cockney speakers are now more likely to live in Essex than in the traditional heartlands of inner London's East End, according to research. Historically the dialect was used by people from the central-eastern boroughs of the capital, but a new multicultural way of speaking has emerged there in recent years. Dr Sue Fox, a socio-linguistic expert from Queen Mary, University of London, found features of the traditional Cockney dialect are now more likely to be heard in Basildon or Barking than within the sound of Bow Bells or modern-day Tower Hamlets - where it originated. Pearly Kings and Queens: a popular feature on the streets of London's East End among the older white working class population, which is making way for a wider multi-cultural community . She said: 'In the last five decades Cockney has probably undergone more rapid change than at any time in its long history. 'Without doubt the speech forms associated with Cockney can still be heard but, with the multicultural diversity we now see in the East End, the Cockney label would seem to be becoming less and less relevant to the people living there.' According to Dr Fox's research, since the 1950s a vast number of the white working class-families which predominated in the East End in the early part of the 20th century have moved to other parts of the country such as Essex. The once rural areas have now been urbanised and are now filled with Eastenders and their descendants. The Bangladeshi community, pictured here at Whitechapel Market, now makes up over a third of the population in the borough of Tower Hamlets in the East End - they speak 'Multicultural London English' She added: 'The sheer number of people who have moved from the traditional East End into the surrounding areas of London, and in particular Essex, have ensured that the influence of Cockney is still exerted in these areas and it is there that many features of the dialect can still be heard. 'It is probably more accurate to say that Cockney has now become more synonymous with white working-class speakers from a much larger geographical region of south east England and is not generally a term applied to speakers of minority ethnic backgrounds even if they have been born within the traditional Cockney area. 'The Bangladeshi community now makes up over a third of the population in the borough of Tower Hamlets in the East End and the vast majority of people in this area now speak what we have labelled as Multicultural London English. 'They don't identify with being Cockney and this new term is more reflective of the current population.'","A new multicultural way of speaking has emerged in the East End .

Over the last decade, there has been a dramatic fall in the number of 11 to 15-year-olds who drink, take drugs or smoke, according to new data. A Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) poll of 7,500 children in England found that in 2012, only two fifths had ever drunk alcohol, compared to 61% in 2002. Put off: fewer 11 to 15-year-olds drink, take drugs or smoke than 10 years ago, according to new data. Pictured are children drinking alcopops (posed by models) Only one in five children said they had tired smoking, compared with two in five a decade ago. And 17% said they had tried drugs, compared with 27% in 2002. Researchers found that the proportion of high school pupils who have tried drinking or smoking is highest in the north-east of England. But the proportion of youngsters who had tried drugs was highest in southern regions and lower in the north. 'It’s encouraging to see fewer young . people drinking but overall there remain worrying trends which we need . to tackle,' said Tom Smith, policy programme manager at charity Alcohol . Concern. 'Those children who . do drink are drinking more - one in four drinkers consumes over 15 . units per week. In addition, the frequency of spirit consumption among . girls has doubled since 1990 and they’re now more likely than boys to . have been drunk in the last four weeks. 'To get to grips with these issues we . need the Government to introduce a minimum unit price, a targeted . measure designed to protect the young and which we know saves lives and . cuts crime.' Campaigners Deborah Arnott, of health charity ASH, pictured left, says too many children still take up smoking, while Simon Lawton-Smith of the Mental Health Foundation, right, says both parents and children should be educated on the mental effects of drink and drugs . Simon . Lawton-Smith, head of policy at the Mental Health Foundation, added: . 'Drinking, smoking and taking illicit drugs are all risky behaviours . that can lead to both physical and mental health problems. 'It’s good news that fewer children are taking these risks, but there’s still a huge job to do. We must continue to educate both parents and children about how substance misuse can negatively impact on their mental health.' Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity ASH, said: 'The continued decline in child smoking shows the importance of having a comprehensive tobacco control strategy. 'Much has been achieved in recent years but still around 200,000 children take up smoking each year. The failure of the Government to bring forward legislation to implement standard packaging was a missed opportunity to significantly reduce the attractiveness of smoking to children.' Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: 'Any evidence which suggests that smoking rates are decreasing among children is welcome. However, we mustn’t fool ourselves into believing that we are doing enough to combat the damage that smoking does to children’s health. 'More than 200,000 children start smoking each year and many are still being exposed to second-hand smoke in the confines of a car. Legislation such as compulsory standardised packaging for tobacco products and a ban on smoking in cars when children are present are needed in order to ensure we continue to protect the health of young people.' A Department of Health spokeswoman said: 'We’re pleased that fewer young people are drinking, smoking and taking drugs. 'Despite clear progress, we know there’s more that can be done to support healthy behaviours in young people, including our plans to challenge alcohol manufacturers and retailers to increase their efforts through the Responsibility Deal; remove displays of cigarettes and tobacco to help young people resist the pressure to start smoking; and continue educating young people about the dangers of drugs through our Frank website and education programmes in schools.'","More high school pupils who have tried drinking or smoking in the north-east of England .

Forget cold showers or huddling around a fan — just head to a supermarket. Because when the mercury rises outside, you can guarantee that your local store will be positively Arctic. But far from shoppers enjoying the bracing air, many — especially those clad in light, summer clothes — complain that supermarkets are too cold for comfort. Chilly: In a bid to find out just how cold our supermarkets are, Anna Pursglove tested the temperature of eight big-name stores near her West London home . While the temperate climes of the ‘bread, cakes and biscuits’ aisle may feel relatively comfortable, it’s a different story once  you reach the frozen wastes of the ‘fresh vegetables’ section. Most of these are much colder than the Arctic Circle at the moment — the  Lofoten Islands in Norway, which lie 100 miles inside it, were a comparatively balmy 18c (64f) yesterday. And who can make tricky decisions about fancy purple sprouting broccoli and Peking cabbage when your teeth are chattering uncontrollably and your hands are numbing into icy claws around the handles of your shopping basket? While UK guidelines recommend that supermarkets maintain a temperature of 19-21c (66-70f) in winter, and 21-23c (70-73f) in summer, the major chains are often far colder, because they refuse to put doors on all their freezers and chillers — claiming shoppers are put off by viewing food behind glass. Aside from the discomfort suffered by shoppers as a result of this, super-chilling tens of thousands of cavernous supermarkets is having a significant impact on the environment. Indeed, one study claimed that if all the UK’s supermarkets put doors on their fridges, the electricity saved would be roughly double the output of the gigantic Drax power station in North Yorkshire. In a bid to find out just how cold our supermarkets are, I tested the temperature of eight big-name stores near my West London home. Armed with a sensitive digital thermometer, I went to the fresh salads/sandwiches aisles, the fresh meat aisles and freezer-cabinet aisles — with surprising results. How do your supermarket’s chillier aisles compare?M&S . I have long held a theory that  posh equals cold when it comes to supermarkets — and M&S backs my theory to the hilt. It’s so cold that I feel like building base camp next to the biscuits, and sending the photographer into the Arctic wastes alone. Freezing: Marks & Spencer proved to be extremely cold. This is a file picture of a store . But while I loathe the cold, and wish the store would give us all a break and put everything behind glass doors, some shoppers like the reassurance of feeling the force of M&S refrigeration. ‘It means the food isn’t about  to go off,’ says grandmother  Brenda Swift, 74. ‘I wouldn’t trust a warm supermarket.’ Our findings: Salads/sandwich aisle: 13.6c (56.5f) Fresh meat aisle: 13.2c (55.7f) Freezer aisle: 13.7c (56.7f) Average temperature: 13.5c (56.3f) M&S says: ‘We try to main an average temperature of 16c (61f) in the food hall area, but there will be some areas that are made colder by the refrigeration units.’ Chill factor: Bring out the quilted sleeping bags!                                   7/8 . Tesco . Positively balmy after M&S but it still falls below the recommended temperature. Shelf-stacker Sam would love it to warm up a bit. ‘I spend all day in protective gloves to stop my hands getting too cold,’ he sighs. ‘And look at me wearing a fleece in mid-July. It’s ridiculous. ‘It really doesn’t need to be this cold. It would be logical to put doors on all the cold units. After all, imagine leaving your fridge and freezer doors open at home!’ Our findings: Salads/sandwich aisle: 19.8c (67.7f) Meat aisle: 13.8c (56.8f) Freezer aisle: 19.8c (67.6f) Average temperature: 17.8c (64f) Tesco says: ‘There is no policy on ambient air temperature. The chillers have to be kept at a certain temperature to keep produce fresh, so where large numbers of chillers are together, the air will feel colder.’ Chill factor: Jacket definitely required (although no imminent danger of frostbite).                     5/8 . Waitrose . Part-time therapist and Waitrose customer Chris Fortune, 60, says while wearing a cardigan to combat the chill: ‘If you think of the environment, expending all this energy to cool a whole supermarket instead of just a few fridges is very silly. ‘Yet, if I’m honest, one reason I shop here is because everything looks so lovely and fresh. ‘Would that be the case if the shop was warmer?’ Cold: Waitrose stores should probably have a 'no flip-flops' warning, says Anna Pursglove . Our findings: Salads/sandwich aisle: 17.8c (64.1f) Meat aisle: 13.1c (55.6f) Freezer aisle: 15.3c (59.5f) Average temperature: 15.4c (59.7f) Waitrose says: ‘The majority of branches’ heating and ventilation are controlled by a computerised Building Management System. 'The recommended temperature is 19c (66fF). It may be slightly higher in  summer due to air temperature.’ Chill factor: In addition to the ‘no dogs’ and ‘no smoking’ signs outside, Waitrose stores should probably have a ‘no flip-flops’ warning.

According to my theory about poshness and coldness, budget stores such as Lidl should be warmer than their middle-class rivals. And so it is. Maybe it’s because the freezers in this supermarket are completely enclosed. Or maybe shoppers here aren’t as worried about aesthetics as they are in Waitrose. The store is still a smidgen  below the official recommended temperature, though. Our findings: Salads/sandwich aisle: 19.6c (67.3f) Meat aisle: 19.8c (67.6f) Freezer aisle: 15c (59f) Average temperature: 18.1c (64.6f) Lidl says: ‘We do regulate the store temperatures through a Building Management System, according to set guidelines and specifications. 'We have a minimum and maximum temperature for each area of the store, from 19-24c (66-75f) for the sales area to 20-24c (68-75f) for the checkouts.’ Chill factor: Lidl sells less perishable and fresh produce than stores like M&S, so it follows it would be warmer. But maybe the more upmarket supermarkets should take a leaf out of Lidl’s book when it comes to enclosing the freezers.                   3/8 . Morrisons . ‘The cold in some supermarkets does put me off, but this one  isn’t too bad,’ says shopper Karen Burn, 34. ‘You wouldn’t want to be sitting around in here but it’s fine to shop in.’ Safe: You can safely shop for your barbecue food in Morrisons without risking hypothermia .

The areas we refer to as “market street” sections — the bakery, fishmonger, butcher and greengrocer — feel cold because of the cold air given off by the produce tables (chilled from below) and the more traditional vertical produce-display units.’ Chill factor: The aisles containing fresh and perishable produce are (on average) just 4f off  the recommended temperatures.

'This helps to provide the right environment to ensure the quality of our ambient and fresh produce, as well as creating a comfortable shopping experience for all our customers.’ Chill factor: Minimal.

The 112-year-old New Yorker has been just crowned the oldest man in the world after Jiroemon Kimura died last month at age 116. Sanchez-Blazquez, nicknamed 'Shorty', said a daily intake of bananas and six Anacin tablets contributed to his longevity. 'I'm an old man and let's leave it at that,' the self-taught musician, coal miner and gin rummy aficionado  said in a statement to Guinness World Records. Record-holder: Salustiano Sanchez-Blazquez, 112, pictured, became the world's oldest man when Jiroemon Kimura died on June 12 at age 116 . Sanchez-Blazquez, a great-great-grandfather, said he was humbled by the attention, . but he didn't feel he accomplished anything special just because he . has lived longer than most. But Robert Young, senior gerontology . consultant with Guinness World Records, said 90 percent of all . supercentenarians are female and Salustiano is currently the only male . born in 1901 with proof of birth. Guinness World Records used census reports, immigration papers, marriage records and news reports to confirm the record. The world's oldest person is a woman, 115-year-old Misao Okawa of Japan. The oldest authenticated person was Jeanne Louise Calment of France, who died at the age of 122 years and 164 days. Sanchez-Blazquez was born on June 8, 1901, in village of El Tejado de Bejar, Spain. He was known for his talent on the dulzania, a double-reed wind instrument that he taught himself and played at weddings and village celebrations. At 17, he moved with his older brother Pedro and a group of friends to Cuba, where they worked in the cane fields. The world's oldest person is Japan's Misao Okawa, 115 . In 1920, he moved to the U.S. via Ellis Island and worked in the coal mines of Lynch, Kentucky. He eventually moved to the Niagara Falls area of New York, where he still lives, working in construction and in the industrial furnaces. He married his wife, Pearl, in 1934. When she died in 1988, he lived with his daughter Irene Johnson, 69, before moving into a nursing home in 2007. Grand Island's Johnson offered her own theory for her dad's staying power: 'I think it's just because he's an independent, stubborn man.' Sanchez-Blazquez has a daughter, a 76-year-old son, John, seven grandchildren, 15 great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren.","New York's Salustiano Sanchez-Blazquez, 112, is the world's oldest man .

Fincham, who was handed a £500,000 golden parachute when he quit the . BBC in disgrace in 2007 . The BBC has been accused of acting like a ‘cosy cartel’ after revelations it handed a £500,000 payoff to an executive who quit in disgrace over doctored documentary footage of the Queen. Peter Fincham, who ran BBC1 for two years, wrongly claimed a trailer showed the monarch storming out of a tetchy 2007 photo shoot with renowned American photographer Annie Leibovitz. In fact the footage was of Her Majesty arriving for the sitting. The ensuing row, dubbed Crowngate, saw accusations fly between Buckingham Palace and the BBC and claims that the monarch had been turned into a laughing stock. He quit three months later after being criticised by a damning report into the affair. At the time the BBC refused to say whether he received a payoff. According to The Times, Fincham – who is now ITV’s director of television - was handed ‘about half a million pounds’ in severance pay when he left. Tory MP Stephen Barclay, who sits on the public accounts committee of MPs, criticised the payment yesterday. He said: ‘It is remarkable that someone who failed to stop a falsely edited trailer which smeared Her Majesty the Queen and was criticised in a BBC internal review should be able to walk away with a public money pay off rather than face disciplinary action. ‘It illustrates a cosy cartel at the top of the BBC who are acting like an out of touch politburo rather than the guardians of public money.’ It emerged yesterday the BBC’s new director general Tony Hall – who recently admitted the corporation had ‘lost the plot’ over severance pay - has asked his staff to give him a ‘detailed briefing’ about the Fincham deal. The news came as the government spending watchdog revealed it has reopened an investigation into BBC severance deals. Earlier . this month, the National Audit Office revealed the corporation handed . its staff £369million in golden goodbyes over eight years. Its . initial report only investigated a sample of 60 recent cases out of a . total of 150. Nearly a quarter of those received more than they were . contractually entitled to. But . following pressure from MPs, it has agreed to look into the files of 90 . more senior managers given severance deals in the three years up to . December 2012. It will present its findings to the public accounts . committee before a second hearing into the debacle on September 9. Misleading: Scenes from a trailer for A Year . With The Queen, which Mr Fincham claimed showed her storming out of a photo shoot with renowned U.S. photographer Annie Leibowitz. In fact the . footage showed her arriving . The BBC has so far resisted calls to identify the majority of cases identified by the NAO, citing data protection rules. But the committee have threatened to use parliamentary powers to call director general Tony Hall before the Commons for an official ‘admonishment’ unless he complies with a parliamentary order to release the information. The committee’s chair, Margaret Hodge MP, said she hopes to publish the names of all those who received more money than they were contractually entitled to. In 2011, Fincham said his role at the BBC had been a ‘lovely job because ... you are given, bluntly, quite a lot of money to spend’. He was responsible for handing presenter Jonathan Ross his infamous £18million contract in 2006. The BBC refused to discuss the details of the case yesterday, but said: ‘Whilst the BBC does not publicly discuss individual contracts, the BBC director general Tony Hall has asked for a detailed briefing about the facts of this reported case as soon as possible.’ A spokesman for Fincham said: ‘He is not in a position to comment.’","Peter Fincham said footage showed Her Majesty storming out of photo shoot .

A girl who took her pet pony for a paddle in the sea dismounted and watched in horror as it panicked and drowned in front of her. The youngster had taken the ten-year-old horse Charlie for a ride to cool off in the water on Marazion beach in Penzance, Cornwall. But when she got off the pony it swam out to sea going ever further out as it got more and more distressed. Despite her efforts to reach him he died. Walking in the sea: Charlie, right, in the water off the coast at Penzance, Cornwall, moments before he drowned . Experts say horses cannot turn while treading water and will often just swim in a straight line. Members of Penzance coastguard rescue team and a lifeguard on Marazion beach tried and failed to rescue the pony. The pony’s owner, Bonnie Reynolds, of Penzance, said the ordeal had left her daughter traumatised. She said: 'My daughter is absolutely devastated. She is exhausted, and hasn’t slept properly. 'As you can imagine, being on the shoreline watching your pony swimming away to its death is just horrific.' Mrs Reynolds said that she had been in touch with the pony’s previous owners who said he had loved the water. She said: 'What horses do when they go out of their depth, if they haven’t got anyone to turn them, they will just swim in a straight line as they haven’t got the movement in their legs, without ground, to turn themselves. Water victim: The horse, pictured, drowned in the water after becoming agitated and going further and further out, owner Bonnie Reynolds, of Penzance, said . 'I think it was a terrible accident. There were no people water skiing, nothing that would make him panic.' She wrote online that her daughter slid off the horse in shallow water - but it went ever further into the water and panicked. 'This was our pony only yesterday, in the sea, not out of his depth, not swimming and with a knowledgeable handler,' she wrote. 'She slid off his side and he got . away from her, he swam out to his death! No matter what people say to . reassure you, it’s a dangerous unpredictable thing to do and our . precious friends are never worth taking a risk on. 'They can swim but are not natural swimmers. Please don’t do it.' She added:  'Hopefully people will imagine his fear and panic, his tired legs paddling, his exhaustion.' And she continued: 'I stand to get . ridicule from people who love to do this, but they have to remember that . this time yesterday I loved to do this!!!!' A Penzance coastguard spokesman added: 'The horse and rider were in the water swimming to cool down. It seemed the horse got flustered by this and the rider got off.' One eyewitness said: 'The people who swam after him were in fear of their own lives and even though one person reached him, he was already gone.

Beaming happily, these are the twins who have defied all the odds to celebrate their first birthday today. It is a milestone their parents feared  they would never see – for Rosie and  Ruby Formosa were born conjoined and  owe their lives to the skill of surgeons who separated them. Their mother Angela was 16 weeks pregnant when a scan revealed that the twins were joined. Double delight: Ruby, left, and Rosie Formosa, right, were conjoined at their abdomens at birth last year. They were separated by surgeons at Great Ormond Street Hospital the following day . Happy: Angela and Daniel Formosa hold their daughters Ruby, left, and Rosie, right. They will celebrate their joint first birthdays today . She and her husband Daniel prepared themselves for the worst after doctors, who at that stage could not tell where the babies were connected, initially gave the girls a low chance of survival. Conjoined twins occur once every 200,000 births, but two thirds are stillborn or die very soon afterwards. Rosie and Ruby were delivered early, at 34 weeks, by caesarean section at University College Hospital in London. Weighing 5lb 3oz each, they were joined at the abdomen and shared part of the intestine. A life-threatening blockage meant they were transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital the following day for emergency surgery to separate them. The operation took five hours and, thanks to the team of 15 doctors and nurses, was so successful that the sisters left hospital just two weeks later. As she prepared to celebrate the twins’ birthday, Mrs Formosa, 32, said: ‘When I was pregnant I couldn’t see us getting this far. Complications: Rosie, left, and Ruby, right, were born joined at the abdomen and shared part of the intestine . Proud: Their mother Angela said she did not think they would 'get this far' ‘I was taking each day as it came. I am over the moon. It’s so lovely seeing them doing normal things and being happy when you didn’t even expect to have them.’ The bond between the girls is so strong they are seldom far from each other’s side, whether dressed in matching outfits in their double pushchair or crawling around having fun. ‘They follow each other round the house crawling. They are very close,’ said Mrs Formosa, of Bexleyheath, Kent, who also has older daughter, Lily, five, with her 37-year-old taxi driver husband. ‘They’re trying to stand up on all the furniture and they’re playing with toys and taking toys off one another. 'They’re very bubbly, very happy, they are very determined, but we knew that from the start really. Miracle: The operation to separate the twins took five hours and, thanks to the team of 15 doctors and nurses, was so successful that the sisters left hospital just two weeks later . ‘They’ve never really been apart so I don’t know whether they’re inseparable or not but they’ll play independently and then they’ll look for one another.’ There are clear differences, though. ‘Ruby especially loves her daddy, she’ll see him and will start kicking her legs and jumping up and down,’ Mrs Formosa said. ‘Ruby is a daddy’s girl and Rosie is more of a mummy’s girl.’ The twins will need regular check-ups throughout childhood, but the hospital is ‘happy’ with their progress. Rosie and Ruby’s birthday party will be held tomorrow, and for now all their parents have to worry about – apart from putting up the balloons – is persuading family and friends not to bring the girls identical gifts. ‘It’s a bit silly to have two of everything,’ said Mrs Formosa.","Rosie and Ruby Formosa were born joined at the abdomen .

U.S. engineers have photographed water droplets using a high-speed camera mounted directly above the real liquid beads to investigate how they behave. They found that a moving - or 'oscillated - drop of water can form over 30 different shapes, including a 'standing wave pattern' and an 'azimuthal wave pattern' Experts took the photographs by shining a light through mesh holes and photographing the light that reflected off the drop's surface as it moved. Scroll down for video . Engineers at Cornell University found an oscillated drop of water can form over 30 different shapes, including an azimuthal wave pattern (pictured). The images were captured on a high speed camera . Just two of the different shapes the water droplets create. The scientists said their study stands out because of the high-quality imaging we were able to capture of these oscillating droplets . The researchers believe their results could provide a fundamental insight into . how droplets behave and that their study could have applications in everything from inkjet . printing to microfluidics. Susan Daniel, assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at Cornell University, led the study,which is published in Physical Review E. Graduate student Chun-Ti Chang designed and performed the experiments, which involved a high-speed, high-resolution camera, while Paul Steen, professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering, and his former student, Josh Bostwick, led the theoretical portion of the study. Professor Daniel said: 'What is really special about this study is the high-quality imaging we were able to capture of these oscillating droplets.' The droplets were captured when A light was shined through mesh holes . and deflection of the drop's surface refracts the light, which is seen . as a deformation of the mesh and is photographed by a high-speed camera . The researchers mechanically oscillated the drops at varying frequencies to observe and record their movements. Here, the movement of a 'zonal' shaped droplet is captured at regular intervals in milliseconds . 'We created an imaging platform where we could look at the drop from the top, to enable us to see the characteristic shapes better than anyone has before.' The imaging platform, which Chang has named the 'Omniview' because of the different angles at which the droplet can be observed, consists of a glass slide, the droplet sitting on top and a 50-micron-square metal mesh, like a window screen, underneath. A light is shined through the mesh holes and deflection of the drop's surface refracts the light, which is seen as a deformation of the mesh and captured by a high-speed camera. The engineers created a special imaging platform to allow them to view water droplets from above, using a high-spreed camera. They discovered over 30 distinct shapes, three of which are pictured . The researchers mechanically oscillated the drops at varying frequencies to observe and record their movements. The oscillation can be likened to when a violin string is plucked. Certain natural frequencies correspond to a given length of string, the same way certain frequencies correspond to the shape of a drop of a specific size. The researchers created a detailed table of droplet shapes according to frequency, as well as comparing these results to previous theoretical predictions involving the dynamics of oscillating droplets. Deirdre Costello (left) and Professor Daniel (right) examine droplets on a silicon wafer treated with a gradient chemical coating. The engineers created an imaging platform where they could look at the drop from the top, to enable them to see the characteristic shapes better than anyone has before . Classical theories don't capture the dynamics entirely, but new predictions, made by collaborators Professor Steen and Mr Bostwick, take into account the physical effect of the solid substrate in contact with the droplet and match the images in the photo album. The researchers also observed that some of the droplets take on multiple shapes when vibrated with a single driving frequency, much like physicists observing two different energy states simultaneously in an excited molecule. Professor Daniel said: 'Without the high-speed imaging, we wouldn't have been able to see the drops exhibiting these kinds of mixed behaviors.' The engineers believe that their study of the behaviour of water droplets (pictured) will inform better methods of printing as the spread of a drop as it touches a surface will dictate image resolution. NASA, who part-funded the study, is interested in understanding how droplets on surfaces move in low gravity . The detailed, clear table of oscillating drop modes should lend insight into further fundamental studies, as well as a host of applications, according to the engineers. For example, NASA is interested in understanding how droplets on surfaces move in low gravity. The research might also prove useful in developing better printers as in high-resolution printing, the spread of a drop as it touches a surface will dictate image resolution. The surface chemistry of the roller, printer and ink will have profound effects on the technology.","U.S. engineers discovered moving water droplets can form 30 shapes .

A star's twinkling could help uncover the sizes and gravity of the hundreds of exoplanets. A team of astronomers at the Vanderbilt University in Nashville have said the flickering can give up a host of secrets of its orbiting planets. Hundreds of ‘exoplanets’ outside our solar system have been identified in the last 20 years but estimates of their size could be 200 per cent out. Sky at night: Scientists have revealed studying a star's flickering can give up a host of secrets including the strength of gravity at its surface and the sizes of its orbiting planets . The team at Vanderbilt however has now developed a new technique of studying the star's flickering to calculate its surface gravity which could cut the previous uncertainties in half - and show if they could be rocky like Earth or gaseous and uninhabitable like Jupiter. Professor Keivan Stassun, who led the team of astronomers, said: 'Once you know a star’s surface gravity then you only need one other measurement, its temperature, which is pretty easy to obtain, to determine its mass, size and other important physical properties.' Researchers showed variations on a timescale of hours in a star’s brightness are associated with its surface gravity. The findings published in Nature are based on observations by the Kepler Space Telescope and offer a simple new way of determining a basic stellar property that has previously been difficult to measure accurately. Optical brightness variations allow a calculation of the surface gravity of Sun-like stars with a precision of better than 25 per cent - a dramatic improvement on other techniques. Brightness variations of Sun-like stars are driven by many factors including granulation - the network of small cells that cover the surface of a star that are caused by columns of gas rising from the interior. The Sun: Brightness variations of Sun-like stars are driven by many factors including granulation . On stars with high surface gravity, the granulation is finer and flickers at a higher frequency. On stars with low surface gravity, the granulation is coarser and they flicker at a lower frequency. Rising hot gases and descending cool gas create hot and cold patches that flicker - twinkling light that is detected by Kepler. Scientists can turn the light into ‘sound’, with almost no ‘hiss’ denoting a small ‘dwarf’ star.Lots of hiss meanwhile would indicate a huge 'red giant'. 'Once you know a star’s surface gravity . then you only need one other measurement, its temperature, which is . pretty easy to obtain, to determine its mass, size and other important . physical properties' - Professor Keivan Stassun . Professor Gibor Basri, of California University in Berkeley, said: 'Measuring stellar surface gravities well has always been a difficult business. 'So it’s is a very pleasant surprise to find the subtle flickering of a star’s light provides a relatively easy way to do it.' Maria Womack, the program director at the National Science Foundation in the US which funded the research, said: 'This actually could be the breakthrough we’ve needed to pin down the sizes of hundreds more stars and exoplanets. 'Getting accurate sizes is critical to measuring exoplanet density which has been a missing puzzle piece for so many planets. 'So - in addition to having implications for stellar evolution - this innovative work will be invaluable for identifying hundreds of exoplanets as either rocky or gaseous.' Prof Jorgen Christensen-Dalsgaard, of Aarhus University in Denmark, reviewed the study for the journal and described it as 'highly satisfying' given the wording of the old nursery rhyme. He said: 'Studying the twinkling of stars does indeed help us to understand what they are.'","Astronomers at Vanderbilt University say flickering gives up host of secrets .

It could also slow down plans for machine-to-machine . wireless communication which is hoping to be rolled out in UK manufacturing industries over the next decade. Wi-Fi uses the radio frequency band of the electromagnetic spectrum between radio waves and microwaves. According to Ofcom, the UK will have a severe shortage of airwaves used for WiFi by 2020 . The report claims that the worst interference will be in . high speed indoor wireless networks, which require multiple high bandwidth . non-overlapping channels. Overall, Ofcom estimates that there will be an 80 times . increase in the demand for mobile data capacity by 2030. ‘This growth in demand for mobile data is being driven by . the increasing penetration and use of connected devices such as smartphones and . tablet PCs,’ said the report.

Europe is losing its competitive edge and UK growth is too low, the boss of Britain’s biggest consumer goods firm warned yesterday. Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever, was also scathing about governments seeking to lower their debts by taxing companies. He said: ‘If they are going to solve their desire to reduce their deficits by putting more charges on businesses they are going to make Europe less competitive – which is what’s happening in some countries in Europe right now.’ Concerns: Unilever boss Paul Polman has warned that Europe is losing its competitive edge and that the economy is growing too slowly . Mr Polman said he believed the UK was on the right track to recovery but growth at 0.6 per cent was too slow. He added: ‘If Unilever put in 0.6 per cent growth the share price would be half what it is today. ‘No one is happy with the small growth in the UK because too many people are excluded from the workforce, and too many people see their standards of living not improving.’ Mr Polman heads one of the world’s biggest food groups, which makes household name products including Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, Marmite, Lipton tea and Flora margarine as well as Persil washing powder, Lynx deodorant and Domestos detergent. Prosperous: Unilever is the 18th largest company in the UK . He has in the past hit out at the EU’s approach to economics saying ‘complacency will kill’ if countries do not push for the kind of expansion seen in ‘tiger’ economies such as China and India. While being a pro-European, he thinks not enough is being done to accelerate growth. ‘Wealth has become global and Europe has lost its relative competitiveness,’ he said. ‘We have become too expensive and we have lost productivity, investment in quality, education and R&D – those are the fundamentals. There isn’t labour law flexibility and frankly we have not yet created a very efficient internal market. ‘The reality is the rest of the world is moving faster and Europe is losing its relative competitiveness. 'I meet very few bosses who say that their cost of doing business in Europe is lower than anywhere else. ‘The cost of doing business in Europe is becoming very expensive, so Europe needs to adjust.’ Mr Polman said Europe loses out by not operating as a single market or investing enough in education and research. Unilever is Britain’s 18th biggest firm with a market value of £35billion.","Paul Polman criticised governments seeking to lower debts by taxing firms .

A new study has discovered that women’s brains are hard-wired to respond to a baby’s cry, while men do not seem to react at all. Research, carried out by National Institute of Child Health in the U.S., asked 18 men and women to let their minds wander. During this time the scientists conducted brain scans. Oblivious: Brain scans have shown that men's brains do not react in the same way as women to the sound of a distressed baby . The researchers then played a recording of white noise interspersed with short clips of a baby crying. The scans showed that while women immediately became more alert after hearing a baby’s cry, the brains of men remained in a resting state. Specifically, the dorsal medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate areas, known to be involved when the mind is allowed to wander, were recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and later studied for results. 'Determining whether these responses differ between men and women, by age, and by parental status, helps us understand instincts for caring for the very young,’ study co-author Marc Bornsteinfrom the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development told Medical Daily. Although brain activity patterns differed between men and women, there was no difference in the brain patterns between parents and non-parents. The researchers also played the cries of infants who were later diagnosed with autism. Interestingly, the study found that both men and women reacted to autistic babies. Previous studies have shown that babies with the condition have higher-pitched cries . Interestingly, hearing these cries interrupted the mind wandering of both men and women. A previous study has shown that the . screams of infants who develop autism tend to be higher pitched than . those of other babies and that the pauses between cries are shorter. It has been long known that women's bodies react to the sound of babies after pregnancy. Soon . after birth, a woman's 'letdown reflex' — the reflex that releases the . milk produced by breasts — needs time to adjust to the . sensation of feeding. Frequent . breastfeeding will help the reflex become attuned to particular . stimulation, but until then, many sensations such as hearing screams and . even certain thoughts may trigger lactation (the release of milk from the breast).","American study shows that men's brains are not designed to respond to the sounds of a baby crying .

The next iPhone will come in gold, according to the latest Apple rumours. Techcrunch columnist MG Siegler said he has heard by 'multiple sources' there will be a gold iPhone 5S. A gold option had first been suggested in May when leaked parts of the new iPhone were shown to be markedly different from those in the current model. The iPhone is currently only available in black and white. While the current iPhone only comes in black and silver, companies such as AnoStyle can customise your iPhone to look gold (pictured) Anastyle uses a chemical process called anodisation that creates the desired colour change. Gold is currently one of the most popular after-market colour adjustments for iPhones . The parts included the loud-speaker . bracket, ear speaker bracket, vibrating motor assembly, Wi-Fi flex cable . ribbon and SIM card tray - which were in both silver and gold. Last week Rene Ritchie from iMore outlined why a gold iPhone could be a good move for Apple. According to iMore’s Ally Kazmucha, making a gold iPhone is much simpler than making one that is black because it’s an easier colour to anodise. The process involves a straightforward chemical reaction, with the possible addition of dye depending on the exact colour needed. Gold is also one of the most popular after-market colour adjustments for current iPhones, including gold cases. The SIM card trays appear to show handsets being made in multiple colours - including silver and gold . ‘Given how popular gold is as an aftermarket option for colour-treatments, and how many gold cases there are - including but certainly not limited to the Asian markets - it could simply be the decision to offer supply where there's demand,’ said Mr Ritchie. MG Siegler from Techcrunch believes that the colour could be more champagne than gold, similar to the old gold iPod mini. However, he also notes, that this model of the iPod was the shortest-lived. The new generation iPhone expected to be launched on September 10 will run new software iOS 7 and possibly include a finger-print scanner . Apple is set to officially unveil the new generation iPhone at an event next month, insiders say. It is believed the event, allegedly . on September 10, will see the launch of the upcoming iPhone 5S and . possibly also a rumoured iPhone 5C 'low-cost' device. Last week, Japanese website believes it has confirmation that the successor to iPhone 5 will be called the . iPhone 5S, and that Apple’s rumoured low-cost iPhone . will be known as the iPhone 5C. The website Macotakara said that its 'sources in Asia' have confirmed the names, which have long been under speculation. The C in the iPhone 5C is thought to stand for 'colour' which could suggest that the phone will come in a range of colours, rather than the standard black and white options. Other rumoured updates on the new iPhone 5S include an slow-motion camera and a fingerprint sensor since a string of code in the latest release of its latest iOS7 Software implied a scanner function. It has been rumoured that Apple will launch a low-cost device, the plastic-case Iphone 5C, to target mid- and emerging markets . The code describes a user touching the . Home button with their thumb. A fingerprint then appears on the screen, . that changes colour - presumably to signify a match - and the . 'recognition is complete'. More . code discovered in iOS 7 suggests phones running the software will be . able to record video at a rate of 120 frames-per-second (FPS) rather . than around 30 frames per second. This is fast enough to allow iPhone users to create slow-motion films. The iOS 7 software also lets users swipe between menus, select apps and control the device's screen using just head movements. A string of developer code discovered in the fourth beta release of Apple's iOS 7 software, pictured, gives the strongest indication to date that either the iPhone 5S or the iPhone 6 could have a fingerprint scanner . When the Switch Control feature is enabled, it will scroll through and highlight different onscreen sections - including individual menus and apps. When the required section is highlighted, users can move their head to the left to select it. Other new features include Night Mode in Maps that responds to ambient light when you use it in the dark. The new iOS7 software for iPhone includes a radical redesign of menus and icons as well as improved notifications and better photo-organising abilities.

A Florida judge has declared a mistrial in a baby death case after the child's mother testified that her ex-boyfriend threatened to shoot her son in the face - information that was previously agreed upon as being inadmissible in court. Hillsborough Circuit Judge William Fuente reluctantly called off the trial of Tampa man Richard McTear on Tuesday, ruling Jasmine Bedwell, 22, had poisoned proceedings with the alleged threat and there was no way for the jury to ignore it. McTear is accused of murdering Bedwell's son, Emanuel Murray Jr., by throwing the three-month-old out the window of a moving car in 2009. Mistrial: Jasmine Bedwell, pictured center in 2009, made the claim on the stand on Monday despite a court order that it should not be mentioned at this trial as it is irrelevant . Bedwell's claim that her 25-year-old ex-boyfriend threatened to shoot her and her son and urinate on the child came up originally in a 2010 trial where McTear was found not guilty of battering her. Prior to the commencement of this week's trial, the court ruled the phone call should not be introduced because it was part of a previous trial - where McTear was ultimately acquitted for assault - and was therefore irrelevant in the murder case. But Bedwell, a key witness, gasped out the allegation amid tears as soon as she took the stand on Monday. 'The jurors heard testimony they should not have heard under any circumstances. In this court's conclusion, a mistrial is necessary,' Fuente said on Tuesday morning. 'I'll say this: I do this with extreme reluctance. I'm not suggesting that any counsel did anything inappropriate.' The mistrial ruling will require a new round of jury selection, which is unlikely to happen before December. McTear, who if convicted could be sentenced to death, will remain in jail as he awaits a new trial. Richard McTear (left) listens to attorneys talk with the judge in court today in Florida . On Monday, Assistant State Attorney Ron Gale had asked Bedwell about phone calls from McTear the day before Emanuel's death. Bedwell replied saying McTear had called her and 'told me that he was going to come over and shoot my baby in the face and p*** on him, in his face, and he was going to kill both of us.' Gale acknowledged Bedwell's testimony was 'clearly... a violation' of the court order but he said he had not expected her to refer to the phone call, which took place about six weeks before her son's death. Tragic: Three-month-old Emanuel Murray Jr. pictured, was killed after allegedly being thrown out of a moving car by McTear . However, he added that he had not specicially told her not to mentioin in their preparations for testimony. 'It did not come up,' Gale said. Legal experts applauded Fuente's decision, adding that proper trial procedure must be followed in death penalty cases because convictions are intensively reviewed on appeal. Monday was the first day of McTear's first-degree murder trial. McTear's lawyers argue that there is not enough evidence to show his client is responsible for the baby's death. Prosecutors claim McTear entered Bedwell's apartment by force in May, 2009 and beat her before . throwing the baby carrier against the wall while the child was inside . it, ABC Action News reported. He then allegedly drove off with the child and threw him out onto the motorway. An off-duty TV cameraman spotted the child's body lying by the side of the motorway in Tampa. Jason Bird said he thought it was a toy doll - until he saw the baby's eyes. A huge manhunt was launched for McTear who had previous convictions for domestic violence and other violent crimes. He was found hiding at a friend's house several hours after the incident and was arrested by police. Trial: Richard McTear (handcuffed center) was escorted into the courtroom for opening statements in his case on Monday in Florida . Shocked: Hillsborough Assistant State Attorney Ron Gale told the judge he didn't expect Bedwell to bring up the inadmissible conversation . Authorities in Tampa said Bedwell had called police to her home in the early hours of May 4, 2009. She alleged she was being attacked by McTear, who is not the father of her son. Bedwell, . who was then 17, told police her ex-boyfriend grabbed her son and threw . him down onto the pavement. He then picked him up in his carrier and raced off. Police were about to issue an Amber . Alert for a kidnapping when the baby's body was found by the side of . I-275, the main motorway leading into Tampa on Florida's Gulf Coast. TV . cameraman Bird, who was on his way to work for a local station, said: . 'Just out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw some trash on the . side of the road. But the more I thought about it, I saw eyes. 'It flipped me out, and I started shaking and said, 'It's a doll, a baby doll.' ' Police in Florida said Bedwell had sought a court injunction to keep McTear away from her family. Shocked bystanders gather near the spot where the baby was found in May, 2009, just off Interstate 275 in Florida . Jasmine Bedwell (pictured left in 2009) became pregnant again after losing her son but her second child was taken away by the state in 2012 . But after she failed to turn up for the court hearing the matter was dropped. McTear is known to police in Tampa and was arrested in 2008 on assault with a deadly weapon and domestic battery. In 2010, Jasmine Bedwell found out she was pregnant again and gave birth to another son in September of that year. But . in January of 2012, she had her second child taken away by the . Department of Children and Families after a judge ruled the boy, A'Jon, . was in danger.

Timebomb: Experts warned that increased life expectancy could push the NHS and state pension system to the brink of collapse . Welfare spending has not been cut since the general election – despite David Cameron’s promise to do so – due to Britain’s ageing population. Experts warned that increased life expectancy could push the NHS and state pension system to the brink of collapse. Mr Cameron became Prime Minister after pledging to cut the amount of cash going towards benefits. But according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, little has changed three years on. The OECD found that almost a quarter of the UK economy is still consumed by social welfare. In 2010, when Labour lost power, some 23.8 per cent of gross domestic product went on ‘public social spending’, the organisation said. The proportion fell slightly in 2011 – but by the next year it had increased to 23.9 per cent. The OECD said the current figure is 23.8 per cent – the same proportion as in the year of the election. The think-tank said spending has in large part remained static because the Government has not reduced pensions and other benefits for the older generations, at a time when the number of elderly people is rising. High unemployment has also been a factor. In an attempt to rein in spending, the Coalition has announced a cap on the amount households can receive in benefits. But the OECD figures will add to Conservative backbenchers’ demands for more to be done to cut the welfare bill. They claim it is unfair that departments such as defence and education have endured deep cuts, while welfare spending has not been similarly reduced. Economist Willem Adema warned that debates over cutting pensions ‘will not go away’ as the population ages. Willem Adema, senior economist at the . OECD, said that an ageing population was a major factor for the figures, . which cover spending on unemployment and housing benefit, state . pensions, and the NHS budget. He also blamed the previous Labour government’s decision to increase family tax credits, and ‘relatively slow’ economic growth that has seen many people continue to require income support. Mr Adema warned that debates over cutting pensions ‘will not go away’ as the population ages. ‘Governments are wary of cutting pensions and benefits of those who are currently in retirement, so a lot of reforms are intended to increase retirement ages,’ he said. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ‘Our welfare reforms are helping to bring the benefits bill under control. ‘Many of the changes that will bring significant savings, like the cap on annual benefit increases, only began this April and therefore will generate savings further down the line.’","Almost a quarter of the UK economy is dominated by social welfare .

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 12:11 EST, 20 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:12 EST, 20 August 2013 . Former President Bill Clinton's foundations spent a total of $50million on travel over the past decade, $12.1million of which was spent in just one year. An internal investigation into spending at the various charities that the former President runs found that the funds used for travel costs have gone up in recent years. The audit comes as new reports have revealed that the Clinton Foundation has been 'in the red' for years even though the charity has raised hundreds of millions of dollars each year, showing the high cost of running the worldwide charity. Globetrotters: Bill Clinton, seen here with his daughter Chelsea during a trip to Johannesburg, South Africa in August, has dedicated much of his post-presidential time to working on his global health causes through his charity . Former President Bill Clinton called in a team of lawyers to help examine the charity's financial standing over a year ago and they drew some unsettling conclusions, and The New York Post reports that the internal audit documents point out their travel expenses as one costly factor. Since Bill Clinton left office in 2000, he helped create a network of charities that have a worldwide and ever-changing list of causes, from helping Haiti after the earthquake to water cleaning practices in Africa. The amount spent by each arm of the charities was broken down by The Post for 2011, which was the latest fiscal year where such data was available. The Clinton Health Action Initiative was the biggest spender, paying $7.2million on travel in 2011, and the Clinton Foundation followed with $4.2million while the Clinton Global Health Initiative spent $730,000. Big spending: Since 2003, Clinton's various charities have spent more than $50m in travel costs; the causes take him all over the globe, like to this school in Haiti where the Clinton Foundation launched a cholera awareness campaign in2011 . Will travel: All of the foundations spent $12.1m in 2011, and ten percent of that was allotted to the former President's costs alone (seen here at a charity golf event that his Foundation sponsored with the PGA this January) Of that $12.13million spent in 2011, 10 per cent was specified as being the cost of travel for the former President himself. Though the total travel fees from 2010 are still unknown, the former President's costs took up more of the allotment as they represent 13 per cent of the fees. Moving forward, the travel expenses for the former first family will only be growing as Chelsea joined the board of her father's charities in 2011. Soon the overarching group is due to be renamed the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Their expenses are not the only ones who are getting some attention, as an earlier New York Times article told how the charity also paid for Academy Awards winner Natalie Portman to fly first class to an event in Austin, Texas, along with her pet dog. After concerns were raised about how the . charity's money was being spent, in 2012 Bill Clinton called in a team . of lawyers to look over the finances and organization of the various . branches of the charities to see if there was excess or inefficiencies. New addition: Chelsea Clinton joined the board of her father's charities in 2011 so she is becoming a more frequent attendee on international visits- like this one to Cambodia in May of this year . Adding expertise: Chelsea used her consulting background to help root out inefficiencies in spending (seen with her father on the foundation-related trip to South Africa earlier this year) Their findings showed that even though they raised $214million last year, they still had an $8million deficit because of earlier fundraising issues during the 2007-2008 recession. Calling the meeting wasn’t the only way that the former President has had a hand in helping the group save money: it was revealed that he often also uses his billionaire friend’s private jets for certain long distance flights. By using grocery-store magnate John Catsimatitis’ plane for trips- like his recent one with Chelsea to South Africa last month- the charities either pay a discounted rate to Catsimatitis or he writes the expense off as a charitable donation. Such close ties to the Republican billionaire also shows another reason why the Clintons have been actively staying away from the ongoing New York City mayoral race, as Catsimatitis is running as a Republican against a number of Hillary Clinton’s former colleagues from her days in the Senate- not to mention her longtime aide Huma Abedin’s husband, Anthony Weiner. In addition to being concerned about making the most of their fundraising money, there is also the very serious possibility that Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2016 and if she does, her involvement in the charity will be carefully scrutinized. Setting her sights: Since stepping down from the State Department, Hillary has become more active in her husband's charities but she may be leaving again to run for president in 2016 .","Former President Bill Clinton runs a number of charities under his name that are focused on eradicating world health problems .

A drug user high on PCP stabbed a 19-year-old college student 13 times after he grew paranoid as she gave him and his infant daughter a lift to hospital, a court has heard. Julio Miguel Blanco Garcia is accused of bringing Vanessa Pham's 'young life to a horrific end', prosecutors said on the opening day of his trial in Fairfax County, Virginia, yesterday. They have asked jurors to find the day labourer guilty of the first-degree murder of Falls Church teenager, who was found dead in the driver's seat of her car on June 27, 2010. Scroll down for video . Caught: Julio Miguel Blanco Garcia, left, is on trial for the 2010 stabbing death of Vanessa Pham, right, after an April 2012 arrest for stealing champagne provided police with matching fingerprints on the murder weapon . Blanco Garcia denies the charge of . Miss Pham's premeditated murder, but has admitted knifing her to death . in a drug-fuelled fury after he begged her to drive him and his daughter . to hospital. 'This is not a . case that is about who,' defence attorney Alberto Salvado said in his . opening statement yesterday, according to the Washington Post. 'This is a . case about why. It is a perfect storm of tragedy.' For two and a half years Miss Pham's killing remained one of the area's most notorious unsolved murders. Despite . finding the murder weapon with fingerprints under the driver's seat, . the DNA evidence didn't match anyone in the police database. A . break in the case came only in April 2012 when Julio Miguel Blanco . Garcia was arrested for stealing three bottles of Moet & Chandon . champagne from a McLean, Virginia shop. It wasn't until last December that investigators matched Blanco Garcia's prints to the DNA found on the murder weapon and arrested the man. Blanco Garcia's trial for Miss Pham's murder began yesterday. Initially, his lawyers tried to get the case dismissed, claiming that the media's coverage of the investigation tainted their client's ability to receive a fair trial since nearly all of the evidence in the case was released before a jury was selected. Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Marum Roush dismissed that claim Thursday, saying all of the evidence reported in The Washington Post would come out in trial and that jury members could set aside what they learned in the press. Taken: Pham was home for the summer, looking forward to a new babysitting job and a visit from her boyfriend when she was stabbed to death giving Blanco Garcia a ride . Pham had just returned home for the summer after her first year studying fashion design at the Savannah College of Art and Design. She was living with her mother at their apartment in Falls Church, and had just landed a babysitting gig for the summer the same day she was killed. Pham was also looking forward to a visit from her boyfriend Aaron Apsley who lived in Ohio. Around 2:45 p.m. she decided to go to the Fairfax Plaza Shopping Center to get her eyebrows done at JD Nail Salon. It was while leaving the salon that she first encountered Blanco Garcia, standing outside holding his 1-year-old daughter. Garcia started his day by going into Washington, D.C. with his daughter to buy $400 dollars of PCP. When he got home he smoked three cigarettes dipped in liquid PCP before going to the mall with his daughter. According . to court documents, by the time he approached Pham outside the mall, he . was having a 'severe PCP intoxication' and asked the young woman to . take him and his daughter to the hospital. Surveillance footage subsequently shows Pham's white Scion exiting the parking lot. Taken for a ride: Pham agreed to take Blanco Garcia and his 1-year-old daughter to the hospital, but was found less than a mile away stabbed to death in her crashed car . According to an account given to police by Blanco Garcia, Pham accidentally took a wrong turn and he overreacted. 'Vanessa did nothing wrong,' a detective paraphrased Blanco Garcia in a report made after his arrest. At . this point, Blanco Garcia was hallucinating and believed that Pham was . going to harm his daughter or call the police, so he acted. He . took out a butcher's knife from his backpack and stabbed the girl 13 . times which caused her to lose control of the vehicle and crash into a . ravine on the side of the road. Blanco Garcia ditched the knife and left Pham to die, fleeing from the vehicle with his daughter through the sunroof. A . driver spotted the car at 3:34pm, less than half a mile from the mall . and called police. When police arrived, they found Pham belted into her . seat and covered in blood with one wheel of the car still spinning. But police were stumped when it came to finding the suspect. Severely intoxicated: Blanco Garcia has spent his day traveling into Washington D.C. to buy $400 dollars of PCP with his daughter, and had smoked three cigarettes dipped in the drugs before going to the shopping center . Even though the knife was left in the car, the DNA evidence produced no matches in the police database. Investigators were certain the killer was a stranger since they had no reason to believe Pham had any enemies or was in any trouble. They canvassed the area around the mall and collected DNA from Pham's friends and family, local sex offenders and homeless people around the mall, but again, no matches. Pham's story was even highlighted on TV show 'America's Most Wanted' to no avail. It wasn't until almost two years later that Blanco Garcia was arrested for stealing two bottles of Moet & Chandon champagne at a grocery store in McLean, Virginia. Even then, it took police until last December 10 to make the connection with his prints. '[Blanco Garcia] was arrested in April for larceny of champagne. Imagine that!' wrote Fairfax County police detective Robert Bond in an email that day. A few days later Blanco Garcia was arrested at his job site in Vienna, Virginia. He said he never told anyone about the killing. A search of Blanco Garcia's computer showed that he tracked news of the investigation on his computer. Blanco Garcia has not yet entered a plea.

Adults should be free to enjoy ‘legal’ pornography without lecturing from the Government, a minister close to David Cameron has declared. Rising star Nick Boles said the Conservatives should not sound disapproving about ‘consenting’ adults privately enjoying online sex. The planning minister, however, acknowledged the ‘appalling’ online dangers for children. He is a close ally of the Prime  Minister, who just days ago  promised to legislate to enforce  ‘opt-in’ filters to block pornography on the internet. But Mr Boles took a more libertarian stance, writing in his local newspaper, the Grantham Journal: . ‘As a Conservative, my starting point is that people should be free to live their lives as they choose. ‘I am not going to start lecturing consenting adults about their  private enjoyment of legal pornography.’ Mr Boles said the internet had ‘expanded the horizons of young people to an almost unimaginable degree’. However, it had also  exposed them to ‘appalling risks and horrors’. He added: ‘Both intentionally and by mistake, children can be exposed to pornographic images at an age when they are much too young to understand what sex can involve. ‘They can stumble upon situations in which the vile degradation of women – because it usually is women – is made to seem normal. Harmful: Pornography depicting rape will be outlawed and automatic blocking will come into force . ‘Worst of all, through the false  intimacy of the internet, they can sometimes be persuaded to exchange images of themselves by child pornographers and paedophiles.’ Mr Boles said the Prime Minister was right to exert pressure on internet service providers to put an automatic block on pornography. This means that adults will have to ‘opt-in’ if they want to be able to access sexually explicit websites. ‘Childhood is fleeting,’ added the minister. ‘The world’s dangers have to be confronted soon enough. ‘Parents need government to make it easier for them to protect their children until they are ready to  venture forth into the world.’ In a victory for the Daily Mail, Mr Cameron has vowed to shield youngsters from ‘poisonous’ websites which corroded their childhood. Clampdown: Prime Minister David Cameron announced strict measures for porn this week . Pornography depicting rape will also be outlawed as part of a government crackdown on web filth. By the end of 2014, all 19million UK homes currently online will be  contacted by service providers and told they must say if family-friendly filters blocking all porn sites should be switched on or off. All new customers will have porn automatically blocked by the end of the year, unless they ask for the filter to be removed. Mr Cameron said he did not want to ‘moralise or scaremonger’ but felt that as a politician ‘and as a father, that the time for action has come’. Google said it recently donated £3.3million to help track child abuse imagery and has ‘zero tolerance’ of indecent pictures of children. Labour has officially backed a new law forcing service providers to filter out filth. But Left-wingers and even libertarians within Conservative  circles have said the plan impinges on personal freedom. Other critics warned that paedophiles and tech-savvy youngsters will find ways round the filters. But campaigners said the scale and nature of porn flowing into homes is unprecedented and that it  normalises violence. There are also fears that the acts witnessed by children warp their view of relationships.","Nick Boles said Cameron is .

Pictures of the helicopter crash scene where two British tourists and their guide were killed during a fishing trip to Russia today emerged. Retired top corporate lawyer Rupert Beaumont and fine art dealer Mark Robertson were hit by the spinning rotor blades moments after stepping off the aircraft. Investigators today began quizzing the pilot as a criminal case was been opened into the horror. Wreckage: Debris litters the site where this helicopter crashed, killing two British tourists and their guide . Investigation: The rotor blades are clearly missing from the Eurocopter EC-120 which crashed while taking two Britons and a guide on a luxury fishing trip to a remote part of Russia . There are claims he initially misled . police on the circumstances of the crash which killed the three men on a . VIP Arctic salmon fishing trip. The probe is understood to be focusing on whether pilot error, rather than mechanical malfunction, may be the cause of the tragedy. Tribute: Rupert Beaumont, pictured, was described as a devoted family man who was deeply admired within the legal profession . The British men - both of whom were aged 69 and from Hampshire - died instantly after being struck by the blades, say Russian sources. First pictures from the scene show the damaged helicopter near a remote river in the Kola Peninsula - with its blades detached. The Eurocopter E120B is shown lurched . to one side, supporting one theory that after landing one wheel sank . into a water-logged ground, making the helicopter lurch, striking the . men on the ground. 'They had no chance,' said a Russian source. The Russian guide was named as Alexander Tushnikov, a specialist in fishing trips to the Arctic north of Russia. Pilot Alexander Shabalin - who had 25 . years flying experience - survived the tragedy and made a distress call . to alert the authorities. Christopher Saul, a partner at Slaughter and May, today paid tribute to his friend and former colleague Mr Beaumont, who retired as a senior partner in the law firm in 2001. He said: 'This is the most tragic news. 'Rupert . was with the firm for over thirty years and built a hugely successful . practice. 'He was admired by colleagues and clients alike for his . wonderful legal skills, his creativity, his grace under pressure and his . warmth and charm. 'He will be enormously missed and our hearts go out to his family.' Mr Beaumont's wife was on holiday in Australia when she received news of the tragedy.

Probe: An investigation is now underway to establish how the Eurocopter EC-120, which has a good safety record, crashed, killing three . Investigative sources are already . pointing to pilot error over the three deaths. Another source spoke of . the 'human factor' in the deaths. The pilot is being probed under an article in . the Russian criminal code on the violation of air safety rules leading . to the death of  two or more people, which carries a penalty of between . four and ten years in jail. Accounts were muddled from different . Russian agencies yesterday but the country's aviation agency Rosaviatsia . said the helicopter 'tilted and fell onto its side'. Crash scene: A major investigation is underway to establish how the helicopter blades hit the three men . The Russian Investigative Committee . -equivalent of the FBI - on Sunday opened a formal review of the . accident and a full-scale criminal probe is now underway. In London, a Foreign Office spokesman . said: 'We are aware of reports of the deaths of two British nationals in . Russia.

'The foreign tourists were staying in a luxury camp for fishing,' a security source told the Interfax news agency. Russia’s . Investigative Committee said in a statement: ‘After landing, the . helicopter turned on its side and its rotors hit the passengers.’ The end of the Cold War opened new fishing grounds to wealthy angling enthusiasts. The . Kola Peninsula was previously a top secret area, home to the Red . October submarine base and the Soviet navy’s northern fleet. Now . it is known as the ultimate destination for high-end fishing tours for . Atlantic salmon, attracting anglers from around the world. More . than 100 British anglers head to its lodges every week during the peak . summer season, paying around £4,000 a week for custom fishing trips. Ultimate destination: Salmon anglers on the 'untouched' Kola peninsula . They . are flown by helicopter to unspoilt rivers surrounded by Arctic . wilderness because many fishing spots are inaccessible by road. Operators . say the region has not been overfished like many popular salmon rivers . and that competent anglers can catch more than 100 salmon in a week, . with some fish weighing up to 40lb. The peak season runs from June to August, when the area north of the Arctic Circle enjoys 24-hour daylight. Outside the season, the rivers are frozen for three or four months a year. The . two British men were said to be fishing on the Rynda, one of four . rivers in the area where salmon forge upstream to breed from their ocean . feeding grounds. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the deaths of two British nationals in Russia. ‘We are in touch with the local authorities and we stand ready to provide consular assistance.’ Tragedy: The helicopter which is thought to have killed the three men was a Eurocopter 120B (stock image, this helicopter was not involved in the crash) Justin .

For those frustrating times when a lone fly has buzzed around your head and you've almost lost your patience - just imagine this cluster zooming towards you. We're used to talking about swarms of bees and armies of ants, but balls of flies have a less familiar ring to it. That's because a cluster of this kind is a rare sight.

Ball of flies: Hundreds of female flies cling to a branch as they prepare to lay their eggs. Their young will fall into the river and move on to their next life cycle . According to Devon Wildlife Trust, female Atherix ibis flies are known to cluster together as they prepare to lay their eggs. The flies form clusters that hang from branches over rivers.

She hasn’t got a Twitter profile and she keeps her Facebook page private. Given that she has spent the last three years as a medical student, 23-year-old Emily MacDonagh probably has little time for such inconsequential social networking – or simply values her own space. All that, however, looks destined to change after she fell into the plastic celebrity world of Peter Andre – a man 17 years her senior – and became pregnant with his child. While Andre’s fans have been quick to congratulate the pair, the Daily Mail understands Miss MacDonagh’s family have been ‘left cold’ by the thought that Andre – who has two children with former wife Jordan – will now be a permanent fixture in the life of their only daughter. A friend of the 40-year-old singer said although Miss MacDonagh’s family like him they think he has ‘a lot of baggage’ and their daughter faces having her life turned into a tacky circus with every aspect laid bare for public consumption. A true king of downmarket reality TV, Andre provides constant updates about his life to almost 3million followers on Twitter, and earlier this month launched The Peter Andre Channel online telling fans they can now watch him 24 hours a day. Miss MacDonagh, meanwhile, has mainly enjoyed an idyllic and quiet upbringing as a ‘solid, middle-class girl’ in a family home in Somerset. Ironically Andre and Miss MacDonagh would never have met were it not for her surgeon father Ruaraidh MacDonagh, 55. He was the star’s consultant during surgery for kidney stones in 2010 and, knowing she was a fan of his music, introduced her to him. The pair developed a friendship but did not begin dating until summer 2012. Miss MacDonagh has now deferred the final year of her medical course in order to concentrate on impending motherhood. New family: Miss MacDonagh pictured with Peter Andre's daughter Princess Tiaamii . The source said: ‘Her family thought it would just be a nice romance and that she would finish university and that as she matured it would run its course. They like Pete but this was not the path they had planned for their daughter – deferring university to have a baby with a man almost twice her age. ‘Pete sees Emily as a sweet girl and chose her because she has no interest in being famous and won’t emasculate him like his former wife. 'Emily wasn’t interested in his celebrity at all. But that could be the undoing of their relationship because in order to be with Peter you need to love the vapid and superficial celebrity world that he occupies.’ Studies: Miss MacDonagh is pictured on her graduation day . Andre has seldom been out of the limelight since being offered a role on talent show Hey Hey It’s Saturday as a teenager. A string of hit singles followed and in 2004 his status as a reality TV star was sealed when he entered hit ITV show I’m a Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here! It was in the Australian jungle that he met Jordan, real name Katie Price. The pair embarked on a much-publicised relationship, marrying and having two children: Princess Tiaamii, six, and Junior, eight. Their relationship played out for their fans on their reality TV programme and when they separated in 2009 Andre was given his own show. The eldest of five siblings, Miss MacDonagh and her brothers grew up in a property worth more than £1million in Bridgwater. Friends now fear the student could be heading for a collision with Andre’s formidable manager Claire Powell, who helps secure his TV and magazine deals. The friend said: ‘Emily’s parents are not big fans of the world Pete lives in.’ Another source however said Andre’s family was not so different from Miss MacDonagh’s. The source said: ‘Peter’s dad is an architect and his parents have been married for around 60 years with five children. ‘Despite the pop star career, Peter has a lot in common with Emily and that is why they get on so well. ‘He has built up a great business outside of showbiz, and owns three properties around the world.’ A spokesman for Andre denied Miss MacDonagh’s family were disappointed that she was with the star and said he and Miss MacDonagh’s father had just spent two weeks on holiday together and they are good friends.","Miss MacDonagh's family are said to have been 'left cold' by her pregnancy .

Archaeologists looking for Roman remains have stumbled across an even more historic find - a wooden railway which was instrumental in the development of the Industrial Revolution. An excavation on the banks of the Tyne unearthed a stretch of waggonway which is more than 200 years old, making it the earliest surviving example of the standard-gauge railway. The discovery was originally part of a network which linked the ports of the North East with collieries in Tyneside and Northumberland in the late 18th century. Discovery: A wooden railway which carried waggons from collieries to the River Tyne has been unearthed . Archaeology: The excavation was expected to find Roman remains but instead stumbled upon the railway . The railway was found by archaeologists digging on the site of the Neptune shipyard, which is currently being redeveloped. Because the site is near the Roman fort of Segedunum, in Wallsend, lead excavators Richard Carlton and Alan Williams were expecting to find remains from the Roman period. Instead, they stumbled across the 25-metre stretch of wooden rails, an early contributor to the mining industry which transformed the North East. The waggonway is made up of a heavy duty 'main way' with two sets of rails laid on top of each other to preserve their longevity, with a loop from the main line descending into a dip. That depression would have been filled with water where coal wagons' wooden rails were rested to stop them drying out and cracking. In the middle of the loop is a stone elevation where the horse pulling the waggon would have stood. Pioneering: The waggonways helped the North East develop and were the precursor to Britain's train network . Breakthrough: Standard-gauge railways ended up being used for steam trains around the world . A waggonway from the former mining town of Tanfield in County Durham . 'The wooden waggonway uncovered by the excavation is the direct ancestor of the modern standard-gauge railway,' Mr Carlton said. With horses and carts eventually replaced by steam trains, railways quickly became the fastest form of transportation the world had ever seen and facilitated the creation of the modern world. In Newcastle and the surrounding areas, the railways allowed coal to be transported around Britain, leading to the rapid growth of the region. Mr Carlton added: 'The coal industry was so vitally important for the North East, and there are so few signs of it left now.' The archaeologists' find is remarkably well-preserved - Mr Williams said: 'It looks as if it has just been covered up and left yesterday.' The discovery has revealed features which were previously known only from drawings and the notebooks of engineers such as John Buddle, who lived near the dig site. Work: The dig on the former site of the Neptune shipyard comes as it is redeveloped for new construction . Preserved: The wooden rails have not rotted because they have been kept from biodegrading under the ground . 'We have drawings describing what has been found by the dig but this is the real thing,' said local historian Les Turnbull. 'It is tremendous to be able to see these features rather than just looking at them in historic drawings and notebooks. 'Because the line is standard railway gauge, it is tremendously important as the earliest example in the world and this is of international significance. The waggonway complex is at the forefront of late 18th-century engineering.' Mr Turnbull, who has written a book on waggonways, claimed that the discovery was more important than any Roman find could be. 'One of the gifts of the North East to world history is the development of the railways,' he said. 'Coal and the railways are Tyneside's heritage and this waggonway was part of that, because without the waggonways the coalfields would not have developed.' In the late 18th century, hundreds of waggons ran from collieries to wharves on the Tyne, where coal would be loaded onto brigs for transport to London and abroad. The excavated remains were part of the Willington waggonway, which took in collieries at Willington Quay and Bigges Main on the edge of Wallsend. In 1801 the Killingworth waggonway, for which George Stephenson's first locomotives were built, joined the Willington line. Stephenson and his son Robert went on to build locomotives at their works in South Street in Newcastle to the Willington gauge, which was 4ft 8½in wide - this became the standard width for railways throughout Britain and much of the world. A waggonway was a timber track used for transporting coal in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. They were an ingenious solution to a problem facing coal barons in Northumberland and Durham - namely, how to efficiently get coal from pit-head to port. The alternative, slower, option was via pack-horse or ox cart. A waggonway was a timber track used for transporting coal in the late 18th and early 19th centuries . Where possible, the waggonway would slope gently downhill so that the waggons could roll under their own weight. The driver sitting on the back would control the brake while the horse trotted behind on a tether. After the contents were emptied, the horse would pull the empty cart back up the slope. The rails on the Newcastle waggonway were made of wood, four or five inches thick and five or six inches broad. Although the use of wood as a travelling surface was not new - Neolithic man had used it for carrying trackways across bogs - it was the use of the flanged wheel, which made all the difference, allowing the wagon to move snugly on the track. By 1810, the wooden waggonways began to be phased out, replaced by iron. Over the years, the wooden networks fell into disrepair. In 2000, North Tyneside Council successfully bid for £2million worth of funding to transform more than 30 miles of routes as part of the Government's Liveability Fund. The former haulage routes were made into a welcoming and accessible community leisure, travel and learning resource.","Archaeologists expected to find Roman remains under former shipyard .

Mia Farrow's brother has pleaded guilty to two counts of sexually abusing two young boys, but also claimed his innocence as he entered an Alford plea in court on Friday. Businessman John Villers-Farrow made the plea at his hearing in Maryland's Annapolis court as a way to reduce his sentence while asserting that he was innocent. The father was accused of 39 counts of abusing two boys, who lived near his home, over a five-year period. Plea deal: John Villers-Farrow, left, entered an Alford plea after facing child sex abuse charges, his sister is actress Mia Farrow, right . Villers-Farrow, told the court he . entered the plea because it was the quickest way he could serve time and . get home to his wife, Sandra Hall, according to the Capital Gazette. He . now faces up to ten years in prison when sentenced later this year. If found guilty on all 39 . counts he could have been sentenced to 50 years, according to NBC . Washington. Under the plea he is able to assert his innocence while admitting that prosecutors have enough evidence to convict him. The . plea was first used in the Supreme Court in 1970, when Henry Alford . argued that he had admitted to murder to avoid being given the death . sentence, which was mandatory in cases where the defendant had been convicted . after pleading not guilty. The Supreme Court ruled that a defendant could plead guilty while maintaining their innocence, to secure a plea deal. Connections: John Villers-Farrow, center, and sister Mia Farrow traveled to India in the 1960s with The Beatles . The Capital Gazette reported that, according to the statement of facts, the first alleged victim moved near to Villers-Farrow’s home when he was six-years-old, and came to know the family, whose son was a few years younger than him. It was alleged that the victim spent a lot of time at the family's home and that Villers-Farrow would buy him gifts, take him to baseball games and on other trips. Prosecutors allege that he began sexually abusing the boy regularly, between the ages of 9 and 16. In the same time period, it is claimed that a second boy who was friends with the first victim, was abused about a dozen times over five years, Deputy State Attorney Kathleen Rogers said. Mrs Hall, who is standing by her husband, has called the two alleged victims, who are now aged 20, 'vipers'. The defense argued that Villers-Farrow, who traveled to India with his sisters Mia and Prudence in 1968 to meet the Maharishi with The Beatles, was generous to many children in the neighborhood. Family portrait: John Farrow and Maureen O'Sullivan with their children, from left, Mia Farrow, Joseph Farrow, John Farrow and Michael Farrow in Los Angeles, February 1947 . His famous sister has not commented about the case involving her brother. When the charges were first made, NBC Washington noted it was not the first time Villers-Farrow had been in the public eye. In 1992, . he famously told PEOPLE magazine that Woody Allen, who had . once been married to Farrow and fathered three of their children, would . have serious legal trouble because of his relationship with her adopted . daughter, Soon-Yi Previn. Villers-Farrow . said: ‘[He’s] going to be indicted, and he’s going to be ruined. I . think when all of it comes out, he’s going to jail.’ Allen, . famous for his self-deprecating and neurotic on-film persona, began a . romantic relationship with Farrow’s adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, 34 . years his junior. Following . the discovery of naked photos of Soon-Yi in Allen’s possession, Farrow . split from Woody and launched a messy custody battle over their three . children, Satchel, Dylan, and Moses. During . the proceedings, which were closely followed, Farrow claimed that Allen . had sexually abused Dylan, though the judge dismissed the claims . because they were not substantiated. Farrow . was awarded full custody, and Allen was denied visits with Dylan, who . later changed her name to Malone. The couple's other adopted child, . Moshe, who changed his name to Moses, chose not to see Allen at all. Defense: Villers-Farrow spoke out on behalf of his sister Mia Farrow, pictured in 1990 with then boyfriend Woody Allen, when he left her for adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn, pictured right with the director in 2011 . In Villers-Farrow's case, the alleged victims claimed that the abuse happened during sleepovers at his home in Edgewater. In . the opening statement of the trial on Thursday, the court was told that . the first alleged victim looked up to Villers-Farrow and spent four . months living with him after being physically abused by his own father. According to the Capital Gazette, . when the accusations were first made in August last year, investigators . asked one of the alleged victims to call Villers-Farrow. During . the conversation, which was recorded without Villers-Farrow's . knowledge, prosecutors alleged he did not deny sexually abusing the boy. The defense however, argued that Villers-Farrow had never been left alone with the boys, and that one of them had solicited their alleged abuser for money. The allegations were made when Villers-Farrow refused to pay, his defense lawyer said. After he entered the Alford plea, Judge Laura S. Kiessling revoked Villers-Farrow’s bond. He will remain in jail until his sentencing in September. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","John Villers-Farrow uses Alford plea to reduce possible 50-year sentence .

Self-styled godman Asaram Bapu is accused of raping the girl when she went to him for healing . Controversial spiritual leader Asaram Bapu is under formal investigation by police for the alleged sexual assault of a teenage girl. The self-proclaimed 'godman' was booked by Jodhpur police on Wednesday, a day after the 16-year-old girl lodged a First Information Report (FIR) against him at the Kamla Market police station in New Delhi. The teenager underwent a medical examination that confirmed the sexual assault, a police official said. According to police, the girl had been studying in a gurukul (school) run by the 72-year-old guru in the Chhindwara district of Madhya Pradesh's for five years. Jodhpur deputy commissioner of police Ajaypal Lamba told reporters that staff had sent the girl to see the 'guru' after she said she felt unwell. 'According to the complaint, the girl had fallen ill at the school and the authorities had advised her parents to take her to Asaram who would do a special puja for her cure,' Lamba said. Accusers say that after a satsang (religious assembly), Asaram moved to his private ashram in Manai, 20km from Johdpur, and called the girl there on August 14. A day later, he asked the girl’s family members to sit separately at different places for a puja. The girl says Asaram then took her to a separate . room on the premise of treating her and forced her to perform 'unnatural sex', according to Lamba. She then went to . Jodhpur with her family, where she broke down and told her family of the incident a few days later. They attempted to confront Asaram at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan, . where he was giving a public sermon on Tuesday. Having been refused entry by guards, the family took the case to Kamla Nagar police station. After registering a zero FIR, the Delhi Police transferred the case to Jodhpur. Asaram's spokesman Sunil Wankhede denied the allegations and said they would be taking legal action against the girl. 'The girl says the incident took place on Aug 15 at Jodhpur. But Asaram Bapu left Jodhpur on Aug 11, so how could this be true?' he said. In January, Asaram triggered a massive public uproar by the victim of a Delhi gang rape in December last year could have saved herself by addressing her violators as brothers and asking for mercy . The Jodhpur police has booked Asaram under various sections of the IPC including Section 376 (rape) and Section 377 (unnatural sex).","Medical examination shows teenager suffered sexual assault .

What started as a random act of kindness in a branch of Tim Horton's has triggered a succession of coffee-buying kindness. On Monday afternoon, a man in his 20s walked into an Edmonton branch of the coffee chain and ordered 500 cups of coffee, costing him $850. As word spread of the generous gesture, others followed the anonymous donor's lead and soon rounds of coffee were being bought in several other Canadian towns by kind-hearted customers. Cup of kindness: An anonymous customer in Edmonton sparked the trend when he bought 500 large coffees . By Friday, Tim Horton's staff, who said they were as surprised and thrilled about the trend as everyone else, sent a tweet stating: 'Eleven acts of kindness, 5,435 cups of coffee, one amazing week,' The person who sparked the coffee-buying spree gave no reason for his large purchase to store manager Joanne Averion, and asked only that the drinks be handed out to the next 500 customers, according to the Huffington Post. His generosity kept customers in free coffee until about 8.30am the following day. 'That's pretty awesome just to know people are out there willing to just go ""Hey, let's do something nice for somebody else"",' one customer said. What had appeared to be a one-off gesture however, soon became a chance to 'play it forward', with a customer in Calgary repeating the stunt in the Crowfoot Crossing branch on Wednesday. Double order: Customers at the chain's branch in an Edmonton hospital were treated to free coffee twice in one day . Grateful: Monica Kavanaugh paid for 800 cups at the hospital to thank staff for looking after her father . On Thursday, word had spread, with people stopping for a coffee break in Red Deer and Ottawa, as well as those at a hospital, finding they had been treated to a free drink. Staff at the Tim Horton's kiosk at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton said a man wearing hospital scrubs bought $500 of coffee in the morning and then a woman ordered 800 cups in the afternoon to thank staff for looking after her father. One of the donors, Monica Kavanaugh, said: 'They've helped my father a lot and I just feel, why not give a little back to the hospital?' Hospital shift manager Brenda O'Connor told the Calgary Sun: 'It really picks up everyone’s morale. Some . people get good and some get bad news and we see that.' She added it was touching to see 'some . of that stress gone just because there’s someone out there with a . little generosity'. As word of the coffee-buying trend spread, some started to speculate that it could be part of a marketing campaign by the coffee chain. However, Tim Horton's spokesman Michelle Robichaud denied that was the case, telling CBC: 'We’re just as surprised and thrilled as our guests have been by these incredible random acts of kindness...our only role is really in pouring the cups of coffee.' Brewing: The coffee-buying trend started in Edmonton, above, but was soon replicated in other branches, including ones in Red Deer, left, and Calgary, right . The kindness bug made sure another 500 . customers got off on the right foot on Friday, after a regular at the Chestermere branch, near Calgary, treated his fellow customers at 6am. Manager Valerie Bruce said the donor, who wanted to remain anonymous, was a regular customer and that his actions had touched the town's residents. 'They’re just touched that it happened here in Chestermere with one of our locals,' she said. 'He’s a wonderful, terrific, kindhearted man. He said that ""I hope other people recognize this as a random act of kindness and they will pay it forward themselves for somebody"".' His wishes were fulfilled later in the day when a customer came in and ordered 20 cups of coffee to be given away. A local radio station on Friday also encouraged early morning listeners to get involved, by getting them to call in and donate money to a fund, which resulted in 785 coffees being purchased . 'This was all spur of the moment,' Rock 102 morning anchor Derek Watson told the Leader Post. 'The phones lit up.' Thrilled: Tim Horton's was shocked and delighted by its customers' generosity . The station paid for 500 coffees at a Saskatoon branch, but a listener later went into the same branch and bought a further 285. It is not the first time Tim Horton's customers have showed their kindness to fellow coffee lovers. In the run up to last Christmas a customer in Winnipeg offered to pay for the coffee of the next person in line, according to Oddee. The simple act of kindness led to a chain of 228 customers treating the person next in line to free drinks, and was only broken when a man who had been given four free coffees broke the chain by not paying for the next person's drinks.","Random act of kindness led to 5,435 cups being gifted at chain's branches .

Probe: A spokesman for the IPCC confirmed that the case had been referred to them by Wiltshire Police on Thursday. The force's headquarters are pictured . Birch is also accused of misconduct in a public office. This charge relates to the way he handcuffed Mr Dove and strip-searched him in the cell. Yesterday prosecutor Ann Ellery outlined the charges against Pc Birch at Swindon Magistrates Court. ‘The deployment of the Taser itself is covered by the assault,’ she said. ‘Thereafter there is the removal of the barbs from the chest.’ She said the misconduct charge related to ‘the twisting of the handcuffs while being booked in, the manner of the strip search and the putting to the knees in the cell.’ John Nutman, defending, said his client was in the ‘strange position’ of being prosecuted before an investigation by the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, had concluded. District Judge Simon Cooper said he had issued a summons against Birch ‘on the strength of seeing video evidence from the police cell’. He told the court: ‘Under the circumstances there is no alternative but to send Mr Birch to trial at Swindon Crown Court.’ The officer was granted unconditional bail and ordered to appear at Swindon Crown Court on August 16.

When 97-year-old Hal Lasko began to lose his eyesight ten years ago he thought he would never be able to paint again. But, with the help of a computer and the Microsoft Paint program, the legally blind Ohio grandfather has found a way to express his creativity and make his retirement more enjoyable. The former 'lettering man' who created typography for American Greetings, and who is due to celebrate his 98th birthday on Sunday, now creates landscapes reminiscent of Warren Kimble or Edward Hopper, which sell for $98. Scroll down for video: . Pixel painter: Artist Ron Lasko uses a computer to create his images after losing his eyesight . Mr Lasko's work in Microsoft Paint has been compared to artists Warren Kimble and Edward Hopper . Mr Lasko, who lives with his son, Ron, in Rocky River, told ABC News: 'When I lost my eyesight I thought my painting days were over.' It was a hard prospect for the war veteran to come to terms with. He had made a career out of his creativity, from being a graphic artist to drafting weather maps when he served in the Second World War. He suffers from wet macular degeneration, which made it impossible for him to continue with his traditional method of oils and acrylics. In 1999 however, his family gave him a computer, in the hope that it would help him to magnify his work and see colors more easily. His grandson, Ryan Lasko, who has made a film about his art, said: 'I knew I had to show him Microsoft Paint, and once I did he just took off with it.' Intricate: The paintings, of landscapes and animals, are slowly created pixel by pixel . Sense of fun: After years of working as a graphic designer, the 97-year-old says he can now enjoy creating images for himself rather than a client . Creative outlet: Hal Lasko's family say they had no idea how important Microsoft Paint would become to him after they showed him how to use it . 'It wasn’t until years later that we realized how important this thing was to him.' Mr Lasko told ABC News: 'I was having a problem with . the paint brush because my eye sight was getting poorer. I went to the computer because I could magnify it. I learned . to use the Paint program just like I paint with a brush.' From village scenes and autumnal forests to stained glass windows, the pictures Mr Lasko now creates in his home studio are both beautiful and intricate. The process can be time consuming but Mr Lasko, who has had his work exhibited in Ohio, said: 'If it takes me two years I can spend that, I've got a lot of patience.' Family ties: Hal Lasko with his son, Ron, in 1949. He now lives with him in Rocky River . Patience: It can take Hal Lasko a long time to create his pictures but he enjoys every moment . In the short film about his art, Mr Lasko added: 'It's no longer work, it's fun. When I worked I always had to do something to please the client. Now I can do whatever I want.' As well as enabling Mr Lasko to continue with his art, his son believes it has helped occupy him after the death of his wife a few years ago. Holding back his emotions, he said: 'I've never heard him complain about his age or ... or talk about dying at all. He doesn't have that in him.' The pixel artist is certainly still going strong. As part of his 98th birthday celebrations this weekend, eight prints, all signed by the artist, are being sold for $98 on Hallasko.com with 10 per cent of the the money going to the Veterans of Foreign Wars program.","Ohio grandfather Hal Lasko feared he would never be able to paint again .

It is the provocative question posed by a Tory grandee which has delighted political gossips: is Boris Johnson the modern Disraeli? The Victorian Prime Minister was a bed-hopping chancer who deployed his flamboyant wit to charm his way out of trouble and exert a hypnotic hold over the Tories. Now London Mayor Mr Johnson has fuelled the debate – by ruggedly defending the flawed leader. Cut from the same cloth: London Mayor Boris Johnson, right, and the flamboyant 19th Century leader Disraeli . His remarks come in a review of the book that first drew the comparison between him and Disraeli. In his article Mr Johnson brushes aside the statesman’s personal failings, insisting they do nothing to diminish his ‘phenomenal’ achievements. The book – a biography of Disraeli  by former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd – argues that, like Boris,  Disraeli’s greatness derived more from character than achievement. Mr Johnson’s rollicking and knowing review, for today’s Event magazine, prompted Lord Hurd to claim vindication last night. Mr Johnson writes in his article: ‘Disraeli is one of the greatest Prime Ministers this country has ever had,’ before recounting with relish the book’s warts-and-all portrayal of  the PM. ‘He was an unprincipled adventurer of dubious sexual tastes... He embezzled money from the husband of his mistress, engaged in at least one ménage-a-trois, had a thing for one smooth-looking young man and seduced a series of older women, persuading one to give him huge sums of money by writing the bemused old trout a stream of oily letters.’ But the Mayor insists that the critique of Disraeli’s behaviour in Lord Hurd’s ‘superb and hilarious’ book ‘fails to make any kind of dent in his greatness’. ‘His achievements were not slight, as the authors  claim; they were phenomenal,’ says Mr Johnson, arguing that a politician’s character flaws should not  be allowed to influence the verdict of posterity. ‘He was the son of an antiquarian . bookseller who overcame entrenched anti-Semitism not by concealing his . origins – but by foppishly and flamboyantly playing them up.’ Lord Hurd said that Boris's robust defence of Disraeli proves he was right all along . In the most telling section of his review, Mr Johnson says: ‘If he  had a flaw it was that he was too amused. To the very end, he made jokes. Asked as he lay dying whether he wanted the Queen to come and see him, he drawled that she would only want him to send a message to Albert.’ He concludes: ‘I don’t know if it was the exact intention of the authors, but I ended the book reverencing Disraeli even more than when I began it.’ In the book Disraeli: Or The Two Lives, which Lord Hurd co-wrote with Edward Young, the peer observes: ‘According to accepted wisdom on modern politics, Boris Johnson should have been ruined years ago... And yet his reputation has soared.’ Last night Lord Hurd said that Boris’s robust defence of Disraeli proves he had been right all along. ‘I am delighted that Boris enjoyed our book, but I notice that he doesn’t actually contest a key point, namely that Disraeli was a brilliant, witty and remarkable politician driven by an overactive imagination and an overpowering love of fame,’ said Lord Hurd. ‘When we started the book, I thought Boris was a bit like Disraeli. Having learned about his review, I am convinced that they are indeed cut from the same cloth.’",Boris defends Disraeli in book review for Mail on Sunday's Event magazine .

In name at least, he is the former president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). But N. Srinivasan stole the show at the meeting of the cricket body's working committee in Kolkata on Sunday. The meeting lasted for almost three hours and paved the way not only for Srinivasan's return as president of the BCCI, but also his re-election at the body's September annual general meeting (AGM). It was announced in advance that Srinivasan wouldn't attend Sunday's meeting, but even then he was the talking point throughout it. Triumphant return? BCCI sources say N. Srinivasan (left) may soon be back in charge after the commission appointed to examine fixing claims against his son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan (right) found him guilty only of betting . Hours before the meeting began, BCCI . secretary Sanjay Patel had received the report of the commission set up . by the board to investigate the spot-fixing scandal that had rocked the . sixth edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 6. The commission consisted of former Madras High Court judges Jayaram Chouta and R. Balasubramaniam. Sneered . at by Srinivasan's critics even before it began the probe, the . commission was called eyewash by those opposed to Srinivasan, who said . that the BCCI would close ranks against 'foreign interlopers'. On Sunday, critics vented their frustrations again. ""Friends time to move on. With people so . hungry to hang on to there chairs and will stop at nothing. Justice and . judicial process mocked- sad,"" [sic] tweeted former IPL chief Lalit . Modi, following it up with: ""Seen the Bcci decisions. All I can say is i . am glad i am not part of this lame duck absolutely shameless . organisation anymore."" While a final decision on the . president's position will be officially taken only after the IPL . Governing Council (GC) meets in the Capital on August 2, a senior BCCI . official told Mail Today that the report has absolved Gurunath . Meiyappan, team principal of Chennai Super Kings, of fixing allegations . while finding him guilty of the relatively minor offence of betting. The . Rajasthan Royals and its co-owner Raj Kundra have also been given a . clean chit, thereby paving the way for Srinivasan's return to the hot . seat sooner rather than later. ""The . secretary received the report in the morning and it was tabled in the . post-lunch session. With the Mumbai Police refusing to depose before the . panel, the commission couldn't make much headway into the allegations . of fixing levied against Meiyappan and Kundra. All that they could . establish was charges of betting against Meiyappan. But not much will be . made of it,"" the official said. He . went on: ""While the report has been handed over to Arun Jaitley, he is . set to go through the findings ahead of the IPL GC meeting on Friday, it . is just a matter of time before Srinivasan is back at the helm of . affairs. Basically it was felt that it is only proper that the final . call is taken in the IPL GC meeting as the matter involves IPL."" The . official further revealed that the findings of the report were obvious . once the police had refused to depose before the commission, making . Srinivasan's position stronger and weakening any claims against him. ""Mumbai Police had refused to . co-operate with the commission, so there was no way in which the . commission could have pointed finger at any of the accused. So at no . point was Srinivasan under any threat. Also, it wasn't a case of him . stepping aside because he was directly involved in any illegal activity. He had stepped aside as his son-in-law had been accused of wrongdoing. So the moment it was clear that the police wouldn't depose, the road for . Srinivasan returning to the hot seat was clear,"" he said. The official clarified, however, that Srinivasan would in all likelihood not chair the working committee meeting on August 2. ""The Working Committee is set to meet . post the IPL GC meeting, but it is unlikely that Srinivasan will chair . that meeting. It seems that he will wait till his name has officially . been cleared by the Board before he takes over responsibilities from . interim chief Jagmohan Dalmiya,"" he said. Even Dalmiya refused to divulge much when it came to who would chair the meeting on August 2. ""Let Srinivasan take his decision,"" is all the interim chief said. By Qaiser Mohammad Ali in New Delhi . Mail Today has learned that N. Srinivasan signed the appointment letters for new BCCI interim secretary Sanjay Patel and treasurer Ravi Savant . When N. Srinivasan famously 'stepped aside' from day-today working of the BCCI at the June 2 working committee meeting, following the IPL spot-and match-fixing scandal, some key board officials raised a pertinent question: who installed the new BCCI secretary and treasurer following the resignations of Sanjay Jagdale and Ajay Shirke? That question now has an answer. Mail Today has learned that Srinivasan signed the appointment letters for new interim secretary Sanjay Patel and treasurer Ravi Savant several days after critics accused the BCCI of ignoring its own constitution. At the acrimonious working committee meeting on June 10 in New Delhi, the house passed a resolution, authorising Srinivasan to sign the appointment letters. ""In fact, five resolutions were passed at the Delhi meeting, and two of them related to the new appointments. One resolution was about the appointment of the secretary and treasurer and other was that Srinivasan would sign the letters,"" a top official told Mail Today. ""The second resolution said that Srinivasan, 'exercising his rights as per the BCCI constitution', would issue the appointment letters to Patil and Savant,"" he said. Senior Board officials like I.S. Bindra, C.P. Joshi and G. Vinod questioned the ""invalid"" route taken by Srinivasan to 'step aside', after Delhi cricket chief Arun Jaitley suggested this ""unconstitutional"" way, as Bindra termed it, to give the beleaguered BCCI president the much-needed relief. Srinivasan, who was under tremendous pressure because of his son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan's alleged involvement in the fixing scandal, was not present at the Delhi meeting. In his absence, Jagmohan Dalmiya, after being vehemently opposed by Bindra and Joshi, was elected to chair the working committee meeting. Hyderabad Cricket Association president G. Vinod also protested, saying that he was not aware of the steps that led to Srinivasan stepping aside. Even as the two-member probe commission submitted its report to the BCCI on Sunday, a top board official told Mail Today that the Mumbai police did not depose before the panel. ""The Mumbai police didn't depose before the commission as they felt that it didn't have any legal standing,"" he said. But the Mumbai police claimed that they had written to the BCCI regarding the legal position of the commission and hadn't received a reply from the board.","BCCI official claims spot-fixing commission has absolved Gurunath Meiyappan, team .

In his final interview, Ramirez spoke of his admiration for Ted Levine's performance as a psychopathic murderer who kidnaps and skins women in the 1991 thriller Silence of the Lambs. Speaking from San Quentin Prison shortly before his death last month, the serial killer described his favourite scene from the classic scary movie. Scroll down for video . Horror: Serial killer Richard Ramirez, who died last month, was a big fan of the main antagonist in Silence of the Lambs . That guy on the show “Monk”, I really liked him in “Silence of the Lambs”,’  Richard Ramirez  told the New York Post. ‘That scene where he says, “It rubs the lotion on its skin,” I really like [it]’ The scene refers to when Levine’s . character Buffalo Bill demands his kidnapped victim to moisturize in . order to make it easier for him to flay her. Actor Ted Levine reacted with repulsion when told of his late admirer. ‘F*** him. I hope he’s in hell. That’s all I have to say about Richard Ramirez,’ he told The New York Post. The newspaper exchanged several . letters with Ramirez in his last years on death row, revealing his . obsession with Asian women and reluctance to show remorse. Repulsed: Actor Ted Levine, pictured left in Silence of the Lambs and now, right, was less than impressed by Ramirez admiration and said he hopes the serial killer is 'in hell' Addict: According to the coroner's report, Ramirez had serious conditions that indicated chronic drug use that predated his imprisonment, including hepatitis C .

He writes that he likes beach . volleyball, girls gymnastics and wrestling, complaining that girls ‘used . to wear more revealing clothes. He also asks for the reporter to send a ‘soft core picture book of Asian girls in bikini[s] or/and clothing items.’ Ramirez had been on death row at San Quentin State Prison since he was convicted in 1989 of 13 murders in 1984 and 1985. He also was convicted of rape, sodomy, oral copulation, burglary and . attempted murder. Executions have been on hold for years, however, . because of ongoing legal challenges. Unrepentant: Ramirez was convicted of 13 murders in Southern California in 1984 and 1985, and sentenced to death but died on death row . Ramirez was a self-proclaimed Satanist whose trial produced gruesome details about his mutilation of his victims. He was nicknamed the Night Stalker by the media because residents were warned to lock their doors and windows as the killings peaked during the hot summer of 1985. The killer had been entering homes through unlocked windows and doors. He then killed his victims with a gun or knife, burglarized the homes and sexually assaulted his female victims. Richard Ramirez died June 7 at age 53 at a hospital where he had been taken for treatment of liver failure. Prison guards have told how the notorious murderer turned bright green from liver failure in the hours before he died. He died of complications from B-cell lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system, according to the Marin County coroner's office.","Serial killer Richard Ramirez admitted idolising actor Ted Levine .

Loyal: Dinah May (left) was assistant to Michael Winner for 35 years and was with him at his death . Michael Winner's long-serving personal assistant has told how he died peacefully in her arms. Dinah May, 59, said the film director and food critic had died quietly after she told him his friends 'in heaven are waiting for you'. The former model and Miss Great Britain was Mr Winner's personal assistant for 35 years. Her notoriously outrageous and straight-talking boss would famously shout 'DINAH!' whenever he needed anything. Miss May's loyalty to her boss meant she nursed him through his deteriorating health and became his carer in his final months. She said she had gone to change his dressings as he lay on a coma on the day he died in January when she spoke to him. 'I was just holding his hand and I was saying, ""What are you holding on for? You said goodbye to everybody, everyone in heaven is waiting for you"" and suddenly his breath started to change and he took his last breath and that was it,' she told the Sunday Times. She added it was 'heartbreaking' to watch him die. 'He had gone through hell and to see it any longer... No, he had to go. I felt so sorry for him, it was tragic,' she said. Mr Winner left her £300,000 and the £1.2 million Kensington flat he owned in which she lived rent-free. But it was revealed last week he owed £12million in debts which has dramatically shrunk his estate to £4.75million. As a result, Miss May has received a tax bill for £150,000 and has been told there is a £600,000 loan on the flat which she will also have to pay. She said: ‘Michael was great fun but oh, what a complete mess. He always promised me a pension. If he saw me crying because I was worried about the future, he told me not to worry because I was well taken care of in his will. 'And of course I believed him. Towards the end he kept writing and rewriting his  will. We used to joke it was like the hokey-cokey. One day someone  was in, the next day they were out.  I suppose that was because he knew the money was running out. ‘Michael made it clear that his bequests to me should be clear of inheritance tax and gift tax and that if there was any, his estate should pay it. He wrote that down, had it documented and gave me a copy. 'It was all done legally. It’s with my lawyer who has been contesting everything with the executors and Michael’s lawyers. If I had to meet these bills, I would have to sell the flat – and then where would I live?'

Prisoners’ right to day release could be severely  curtailed in light of a spate of alleged offences by inmates. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling last night launched a review amid public concern over two serious incidents in the last fortnight. A double killer on his first solo day out is accused of murdering a Good Samaritan. Ian McLoughlin is charged with stabbing Graham Buck, 66, in Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, on July 13. Review: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling could curtail day release for prisoners . Mr Buck had responded to cries from the home of neighbour Francis Cory-Wright, 86, a paedophile McLoughlin, 55, met in prison. On Thursday a man thought to be on day release from Ford open prison held up a bank with a gun in Borough, South-East London. Last night Mr Grayling said: ‘I have asked for a review of the way in which we carry out releases on temporary licence to see whether any changes are necessary. Charge: Ian McLoughlin, 55, is accused of murdering a Good Samaritan on his first day of solo release . ‘We need a process for people to be reintegrated into the community at the end of their sentence, but it needs to be right and it needs to be something the public has confidence in.’ Hundreds of prisoners are let out of jail every year for short periods before the end of their sentence. This ‘release on temporary licence’ is supposed to prepare them for normal life. Most are from open prisons and can be for a day or overnight. Some are supervised but other inmates are let loose and required only to return at a specified time. No one should be released if they could be a threat to the public. Prison authorities conduct risk assessments of a criminal’s past and behaviour behind bars to judge if they are a danger – but the process is far from perfect. Prison unions warn inmates who are not safe are being wrongly put in open prisons too early. The review is likely to look at how inmates’ risk level is judged. In Thursday’s hold-up, drinkers dived under tables as the armed suspect ran through the George pub in Borough pursued by bank guards. He allegedly fled a local Barclays empty-handed.","Justice Secretary Chris Grayling last night promised a review of the system .

A doctor who was exposed by the Mail on Sunday for helping motorists to make bogus whiplash claims is to appear before a disciplinary hearing tomorrow. Dr Muhammad Raheel Shaikh charged £250 for an 18-minute-long ‘medical examination,’ where he diagnosed an undercover reporter as having whiplash injuries, even after the fake motorist said he suffered from no pain. His medical report - which stated that the bogus patient was suffering from moderate whiplash injuries - could have been used by the reporter to make a false personal injury claim worth thousands of pounds. Allegations: Dr Muhammad Raheel Shaikh, allegedly helped motorists make bogus whiplash claims (file picture) The MoS investigated Dr Shaikh, 41, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, as part our campaign to end the scourge of bogus whiplash claims, which costs the insurance industry £2billion per annum, and had put the premium of every motorist by £90 per year. Our campaign prompted the move to change legislation that has led to insurance premiums falling by almost 10 per cent over the past 12 months. Latest figures from the AA show that an average fully-comprehensive policy is now £594.86, compared to £659. 53 last July. The AA said that this was the biggest drop in insurance premiums since their index began in 1994. In response to our campaign, the Government introduced tighter laws to clamp down bogus personal claims, which had made Britain the ‘whiplash capital of Europe.’ From 2005 to 2010, accident injury claims soared by 70 per cent, despite road accidents falling by 23 per cent. Reforms: In response to our campaign, the Government introduced tighter laws to clamp down bogus personal claims, which had made Britain the ¿whiplash capital of Europe' (file picture) New Government measures include banning controversial referral fees, or payments of up to £800, that law firms pay middlemen and claims companies for every personal injury claimant they introduce to them. The Government is also considering a national panel of independent doctors, who will medically assess whiplash patients, rather ones appointed by insurance companies and claims firms. Dr Shaikh, who was on the Yorkshire and Humber GP training programme at the time and was on placement at Doncaster Royal Infirmary at the time, was approached by the MoS reporter after we received a tip-off about him from another whiplash injury expert. The doctor, who held his whiplash clinics at a sports centre in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, was going to see 10 patients that day, which would have netted him £2,500 for a few hours work. The medic initially told our reporter ‘honesty is the best policy,’ but said later: ‘I’ll help you….I know what to say.’ The General Medical Council, which is investigating Dr Shaikh, said: ‘The Panel will inquire into the allegation that during a consultation with Patient A [MoS reporter] on 2 June 2012 Dr Shaikh asked leading questions and provided suggested responses to Patient A. ‘It is also alleged that in a report, dated 2 June 2012, he made false statements. It is further alleged that his conduct was misleading and dishonest.’ The hearing is expected to last all week. Dr Shaikh could not be reached for comment.","Dr Muhammed Rahel Shaikh will face a GMC hearing tomorrow .

For more than a decade, John Maxse was the suave face of the biggest organisations in British horseracing. But that face was looking rather less suave yesterday following an alleged attack by one of the Queen’s riders in what is believed to have been a fight over a woman. In fact, Mr Maxse – former PR director at both the Jockey Club and the British Horseracing Authority, appeared to be sporting a black eye and a number of cuts and bruises. John Maxse (left) suffered 'serious injuries' and required hospital treatment following the alleged attack in Newmarket last Sunday. Jonathan Nolan (right) has been charged with grievous bodily harm with intent . The 45-year-old former jockey, who now works for the Qatari Royal Family, suffered ‘serious injuries’ and required hospital treatment for a suspected broken eye socket, broken collarbone and broken nose following the alleged attack in Newmarket last Sunday. Jonathan Nolan, 32, who is a work rider for the Queen’s trainer Sir Michael Stoute, has been charged with grievous bodily harm with intent. Officers were called to an address in the Suffolk town – considered the global home of horseracing – at about 11.30pm following a call from a member of the public. Mr Maxse, who splits his time between properties in London and Newmarket, later wrote on Twitter: ‘You know those times when you live through something potentially life changing but it’s just a bit too “big & heavy” for Twitter?’ He went on to joke about how he looked like film character Rocky Balboa. Yesterday he added on the social media site: ‘Said my Sunday morning goodbye to Newmarket &, for a change, good riddance; on account of some of the toxic people who live there.’ When asked by the Mail if he believed the attack was because of him having an alleged relationship with Nolan’s girlfriend, Mr Maxse was keen to stress that the woman involved was Nolan’s ex-girlfriend. Mr Maxse, the former PR director at both the Jockey Club and the British Horseracing Authority, now works as a communications consultant for Qatar Racing, the horse investment firm owned by the Qatari Royal Family . He added: ‘There was no argument on the night, there was no fight.’ But he refused to comment further, saying it would ‘cause too much pain to other people’. Mr Maxse is a prominent figure in horseracing and was the public face of the British Horseracing Authority and Jockey Club when he worked at both as PR director. He was the Jockey Club’s head of PR during the BBC Panorama programme’s damaging investigation into racing a decade ago. He now works as a communications consultant for Qatar Racing, the horse investment firm owned by the Qatari Royal Family. He also rides out regularly for Newmarket trainer Michael Bell. 'You know those times when you live . through something potentially life changing but it’s just a bit too “big . & heavy” for Twitter?' - John Maxse, writing on Twitter . Nolan is a work rider at Sir Michael Stoute’s Freemason Lodge Stables in Newmarket. He used to ride the Queen’s horse Carlton House when it was trained there. A work rider generally undertakes daily duties that include mucking out, exercising, grooming, feeding, watering, rugging up and bedding down horses. Earlier this year, Sir Michael trained the Queen’s horse Estimate to Gold Cup victory at Royal Ascot. It was the first time in the race’s 207-year history that it was won by a reigning monarch. Nolan appeared in court in  Bury St Edmunds on Tuesday charged with grievous bodily harm with intent and was bailed to a later date. Newmarket is dominated by horseracing and one in three jobs in the area is estimated to be related to the sport. There are just 15,000 people but more than 3,000 racehorses in the town, which boasts two large racetracks – The Rowley Mile and The July Course.

U.S. Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler's two-week-old baby is believed by doctors to be the first child to survive Potter Sequence, a usually fatal in-utero illness caused by prenatal kidney failure. Abigail Rose Beutler was born prematurely at 28 weeks on July 15, Herrera Beutler announced Monday. Doctors had diagnosed Potter Sequence, in which impaired kidney function leads to low amniotic fluid during pregnancy. It is typically fatal because the lack of amniotic fluid prevents the lungs from developing. In an uncommon procedure, doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore performed amnioinfusion by injecting saline solution into Beutler's womb in the place of amniotic fluid, during the pregnancy. Miracle baby: The Beutlers with their tiny newborn Abigail who is two weeks old and breathing on her own after surviving Potter Sequence . Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (right) is pictured with her husband, Daniel, and House Speaker John Boehner during a mock swearing in. Herrera announced that her unborn child has Potter's Sequence just weeks ago . Though only two pounds 12 ounces at birth, Abigail had fully developed lungs and she is breathing on her own, suggesting that the relatively uncommon treatment had worked. Abigail has no kidneys and still requires ongoing dialysis and will eventually need a kidney transplant. Herrera Beutler and her husband said in a statement that they were thankful for the doctors and nurses who were not willing to accept the fatal diagnosis. 'We are grateful to the thousands who joined us in praying for a miracle. But most of all, we are grateful to God for hearing those prayers,' Herrera Beutler and her husband said in a joint statement. On a Facebook page announcing the baby's birth, the Beutlers reveal how they refused to give up on their baby. 'Multiple doctors explained that based on medical evidence her condition was incompatible with life and that, if she survived to term, she would be unable to breathe and live only moments after birth,' they write. 'We were also told that dialysis or transplant were not possible.  The options we were offered were termination or “expectant management,” that is, waiting for her to die. Instead, we chose to pray earnestly for a miracle.' Dr Louis Halamek, a neonatologist at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital in California, said he is cautiously optimistic about the baby's future. Joyous: Herrera Beutler and her husband Daniel say they have no reason to believe their daughter can't lead a full and healthy life . 'Despite Abigail's prematurity, small size and life-threatening disease, she is doing well,' Halamek said. Herrera Beutler, 34, is a Republican in her second term in Congress, representing the 3rd district covering the southwest portion of Washington state. She and her husband, Daniel, had announced the tragic . development regarding their first child on Beutler's Facebook page. 'At . a recent, routine ultrasound appointment we received the difficult news . that our baby has a serious medical condition called Potter’s . Syndrome,' the Beutlers wrote. 'Potter’s Syndrome (or Potter’s Sequence) is abnormally low amniotic fluid caused by impaired kidney function . which inhibits normal lung development and is often fatal.' Expectant mother: Rep. Beutler, 34, had announced on May 1 that she was expecting her first child in the fall . Babies with Potter Sequence typically die within a couple days of being born, according to the National Institute of Health.

Last year Brazilian oil tycoon and seventh richest man on the planet Eike Batista had a total wealth of $34 billion. But the 56-year-old, who bankrolled the bid to bring the 2016 Olympics to his home country, has gone from top of the pile to number 100 on the Forbes rich list after losing $33 billion over 16 months. It is a big drop for a man who had boasted of his plans to take over from Mexican Carlos Slim as the richest man in the world. Losses: Eike Batista has lost billions of dollars, and his place as the seventh richest man in the world . The father-of-two, who bought his first gold mine at the age of 24, lost a vast chunk of his fortune when his oil conglomerate, OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA, lost 90 per cent of its value over the past year, leaving Mr Batista with an estimated net worth of $200 million when the debts he owes to investors have been deducted, according to the Huffington Post. The charismatic tycoon, known for his love of speedboats, had told Bloomberg last year that he exemplified a 'Brazilian dream' of entrepreneurial success. However, it is claimed that the businessman may have been overly optimistic with his investments at a time when Brazil's economy was faltering. 'His loss of credibility is explained by . not delivering on the results promised when he listed his companies,' Elad Revi, an investment analyst in Sao Paulo told Bloomberg. 'There was a chain reaction: he lost credibility in . one, then he lost it in all of them.' While his loss hasn't expelled him from Forbes' top 100 billionaire list, it was a long way to fall for a man used to success. Even in his private life, Mr Batista was on to a winning streak. He has won the World Championships in powerboat racing in the 1990s, and in 2006 he broke a speed record on his $19 million super yacht Spirit of Brazil, according to Elite Choice. Luxury lifestyle: The billionaire owned a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren, above, and at least three private jets, including this one, below . Fast living: Eike Batista set a speed record in his $19 million Pershing super yacht, like the one pictured . The Brazilian had a reputation for his luxurious lifestyle, which included a fleet of private jets as well as a $1.2 million Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren which he kept parked in the lounge of his Rio home. The car was crashed by his 20-year-old son last year, when he knocked over a cyclist who later died. Thor Batista was sentenced to two years' community service and fined $500,000 for the fatal crash in June, according to Fox News. During an interview with the billionaire in 2008, a Bloomberg reporter noted that he conducted meetings in his office overlooking Sugarloaf mountain, while hooked up to an IV drip feeding him vitamins in an effort to delay aging. 'I think big, and I'm not afraid to take risks - even if I'm alone,' Mr Batista said at the time. 'I started out in the gold business. I know about risk and loss and having to build a business from scratch when nobody believes in you.' Ambition: Eike Batista had boasted of plans to become the richest man in the world . The businessman, who has invested a large part of his fortune in his beloved city, Rio, over the years, has vowed to make sure any debts from his current losses are cleared. 'I will honor all of my obligations. I won’t leave a single . penny unpaid for each one of my debts,' he said. He has also reminded investors that his companies still have billions of dollars of available cash and told his 1.3 million Twitter followers that anyone who bet against him would be 'caught with their pants down', the New York Times reported.","Eike Batista had boasted of desire to be wealthiest person on the planet .

Internet giants came under fire last night from MPs who warned that it is ‘still too easy’ to access child pornography and material that incites terrorism online. In a scathing report, Westminster’s home affairs committee accused ‘complacent’ internet service providers of being ‘far too laid back about what takes place on their watch’. The MPs are demanding a new mandatory code of conduct that will force service providers to take down vile content. Easily accessible: Westminster's home affairs committee accused internet service providers of being 'complacent' about the material they leave online . They say this is particularly urgent in the wake of the murders of April Jones and Tia Sharp – whose killers had both accessed child porn online. They are also concerned that, in the aftermath of the Woolwich attack, extremist material used to incite terrorism remains freely available online. Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘The tragic murders of April Jones and Tia Sharp have shown the terrible consequences of access to indecent images on the web.’ He added: ‘Young people are radicalised online by the words of radical clerics such as Anwar al-Awlaki on YouTube or internet magazine Inspire. What starts on the web, ends up on the streets of Woolwich. ‘The Prime Minister was right to highlight the responsibility of the internet service providers, search engines and social media sites. Victims: Murdered girls April Jones, left, and Tia Sharp, right, were both killed after their attackers had been viewing child pornography . ‘They are far too laid back about what takes place on their watch and they need to do more to take inappropriate content down. If they do not act, the Government should legislate.’ Yesterday, the Mail told how Google had been accused of turning a blind eye to child sex predators after it refused to sign up to an alert system that could stop paedophiles viewing vile images online. Search engine Bing, which is owned by Microsoft, and Yahoo! have both agreed to flash up warning messages on the screens of users who type in terms  that could lead them to child abuse sites. Determined: David Cameron has warned internet providers that he is prepared to legislate on the clampdown . Experts say the warnings would deter half of paedophiles by reminding them that their criminal activity can be tracked. The MPs want the Government to draw up a mandatory code of conduct with internet companies for dealing with child porn. This would force them to remove material that breaches ‘acceptable behavioural standards’. They also want an anti-extremist version of the Internet Watch Foundation, which monitors online porn. They say internet companies such as Google – which this month reported profits of  £6.4billion for the period April to June this year – should pay for the new body. The report says: ‘There is no excuse for complacency. We urge those responsible to take stronger action to remove such content.’ Google said yesterday: ‘Child sex abuse imagery is illegal and we have a zero tolerance policy to it. We use purpose-built technology and work with child safety organisations like the Internet Watch Foundation to find, remove and report it, because we never want this material to appear in our search results. ‘We are working with experts on effective ways to deter anyone tempted to look for this sickening material.’","MPs demand mandatory code of conduct for internet providers .

Councils will be banned from imposing minimum distance limits that would help protect communities from the scourge of wind farms.

Speaking . after the Milton Keynes court case, anti-wind farm Tory MP Chris . Heaton-Harris said: ‘Local residents should be able to have a say on how . far wind farms are sited from their homes. We do live in a democracy.’ He pointed out the case was rejected on a technicality and that the campaign for separation distances would go on. Unveiling the guidance yesterday, Mr . Pickles said it would give communities a greater say on the siting of . wind turbines and solar farms. ‘The views of local people must be . listened to when making planning decisions,’ he said. ‘Meeting Britain’s energy needs should not be used to justify the wrong development in the wrong location.’ Campaigners had been hoping for a stronger line on separation distances after Mr Boles said in a Commons debate last year that buffers ‘might be appropriate’ in some areas. Landscape: The Government's proposal says it takes the topography into account and will stop inappropriate and poorly-placed sites . He said he was backing plans by Lincolnshire County Council to bring in a minimum distance of 1.4miles from residential properties. But the smallprint of the  new planning guidance specifically rules out buffer zones between wind turbines and houses. It says: ‘Local planning authorities should not rule out otherwise acceptable renewable energy developments through inflexible rules on buffer zones or separation distances.’ A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said:  ‘This represents a significant increase in protection for England’s heritage and landscape, ensuring that the local environment and local amenity is given the protection it deserves. ‘The new guidance allows topography to be taken into account, to stop inappropriate and badly sited wind turbines.’","Blow to anti-wind power campaigners who want to impost limits of around three quarters of a mile .

The lieutenant governor of Texas is under fire for a personal phone call he placed to police demanding to know how to get a relative out of jail. David Dewhurst called the Allen, Texas police department after they arrested his stepsister’s daughter-in-law for shoplifting groceries and made numerous requests, including one particularly noteworthy demand for the cell phone numbers a county judge and sheriff. While doing his best to avoid asking outright for the release of Ellen Bever, who he called his niece, Dewhurst repeatedly used his full professional title, insisted on speaking to the most senior officer possible, and even asked for the personal phone numbers of a judge and the county sheriff. Scroll down to hear Dewhurst's call... What I do? Texas lieutenant governor David Dewhurst is under fire for making an August 3 phone call to police after the arrest of a relative that some say was inappropriate . Thief? Ellen Bevers, here in her August 3 mugshot, was arrested for allegedly stealing $57 worth of groceries at a Texas Kroger . ‘I am every year the No. 1 pick of all of the law enforcement agencies within Texas, the No. 1 pick. I’m a supporter of you, and everyone in law enforcement,’ Dewhurst says in a recording of the call released by police. ‘I want you to do whatever is the proper thing.’ The proper thing, it turned out, was for the on-duty Allen police officer to decline to give Dewhurst the cell phone numbers of Collin County officials. This, despite the lieutenant governor’s repeated requests for the officer full name and for the number of his ‘immediate supervisor.’ Bevers, who is an elementary school teacher, was jailed after a Kroger store accused her of shoplifting $57 worth of groceries on August 3. A recording of Dewhurst’s call was only made public Wednesday after an official request from NBC DFW. Dewhurst tells the officer who takes his call, a Sargent Maness, that he’s known Bevers ‘for 30 years of my life’ and maintains the shoplifting charge was a mistake because ‘this lady is 100 percent innocent.’ Sergeant Maness, however, didn’t take Dewhurst’s bait. Maness told Dewhurst he’d have to post bond at the county jail, where Bevers was set to be transferred at the time of the phone call. The flummoxed politician did not give up right then, however. Legal: Allen, Texas police sergeant Jon Felt said nothing illegal was said in the phone call Dewhurst made to his department August 3 . Plausible? Dewhurst insisted in the call to Allen police that Bevers simply accidentally forgot to scan $57 worth of groceries at a Kroger self checkout counter . ‘If you would explain to me sergeant what I need to do to arrange for getting her out of jail this evening so that you can proceed with whatever you think,’ Dewhurst emphasizes once again, ‘that is proper.’ And, again, Dewhurst was properly informed that he’d just have to post bond like everyone else. At least one area police officer has come to the aid of the self-proclaimed ‘No. 1 pick of all of the law enforcement agencies within Texas.’ ‘There is nothing criminal here,’ Sergeant Jon Felty of the Allen Police Department told NBC DFW. ‘When I listen to this recording, I hear much of what every family member has when they have a relative incarcerated.’ var nbcLP={};nbcLP.aRandomNumber=Math.floor(Math.random()*10000);nbcLP.currentPageLoc=encodeURIComponent(window.location.href);nbcLP.currentSiteLoc=encodeURIComponent(window.location.host);nbcLP.defaultWidth=634;nbcLP.defaultHeight=357;nbcLP.cmsID=""220599661"";nbcLP.vidPid=""99L_m1fWBRye"";nbcLP.vidSec=""TK"";nbcLP.vidSubSec=""TK"";nbcLP.vidFrame=document.getElementById(""nbcLP220599661"");nbcLP.vidFrame.style.border=""none"";nbcLP.vidFrame.width=nbcLP.defaultWidth;nbcLP.vidFrame.height=nbcLP.defaultHeight;nbcLP.vidFrame.scrolling=""no"";nbcLP.vidFrame.src=""http://www.nbcdfw.com/templates/nbc_partner_player?cmsID=""+nbcLP.cmsID+""&videoID=""+nbcLP.vidPid+""&width=""+nbcLP.defaultWidth+""&height=""+nbcLP.defaultHeight+""&sec=""+nbcLP.vidSec+""&subsec=""+nbcLP.vidSubSec+""&turl=""+nbcLP.currentSiteLoc+""&ourl=""+nbcLP.currentPageLoc+""&rand=""+nbcLP.aRandomNumber; . Hold up: Dewhurst's re-election campaign insists he only called out of concern for Brevers but his opponents have pounced and call his actions inappropriate . The lieutenant governor’s campaign also released a statement. ‘David acted as a concerned family member in an attempt to acquire information on how to post bail for his niece while reiterating multiple times in the full conversation that law enforcement follow their normal protocols and procedures,’ said spokesman Travis Considine. Dewhurst’s opponents disagree. One primary challenger, state senator from Houston Dan Patrick issued a statement that expressed his disappointment over Dewhurst’s behaviour. ‘The fact that David Dewhurst believes he and his family are above the law is the height of arrogance and recklessness,’ he said. ‘This blatant abuse of power would be stunning coming from any elected official. However, it is particularly disturbing coming from the lieutenant governor of Texas.’","'This is David Dewhurst, lieutenant governor of the state of Texas': Dewhurst used his title over and over in a 10 minute call to police .

A sting operation has foiled a plot to abduct, torture and kill police officers by an anti-authority sovereign citizen movement, Las Vegas police said on Thursday. David Allen Brutsche and Devon Campbell Newman were arrested at an apartment a few miles off the Vegas Strip before they could carry out a plan to snatch officers, 'put them on trial' and execute them in a vacant house, police Lt. James Seebock said. Federal authorities regard sovereign citizen extremists as domestic terrorists. 'Domestic terrorists': David Allen Brutsche (left) and Devon Campbell Newman were arrested after hatching a plot to abduct and torture LV police officers . Authorities have linked sovereign citizens groups with violent confrontations in recent years, including deadly shootings in Louisiana and Arkansas. Brutsche, 42, and Newman, 67, wanted to draw attention to the group's rejection of governmental authority, making the case a domestic terror plot, Seebock said. 'They were furthering their ''sovereign citizen'' ideology by committing criminal acts toward law enforcement,' he said. Brutsche and Newman were held in Clark County jail pending court appearances on charges including conspiracy to commit murder and attempted kidnapping. It was not immediately clear whether they had lawyers. The investigation began when an unidentified undercover officer befriended Brutsche and Newman in April, police said. The three participated in meetings and training sessions about sovereign citizen philosophy and later shopped for guns and discussed plans to track and videotape police officers to determine whom to abduct, according to a 10-page arrest report. They found a vacant house and rigged it with bolts drilled into wall supports, creating a makeshift jail where they planned to bind captive officers to cross beams for interrogation, police said. Plot: The pair had were arrested near the Vegas strip after planning to rig a vacant house with a makeshift jail . Authorities haven't released video evidence, but the report states that Brutsche and Newman recorded videos about their actions and ideology to post following the planned abductions. Hundreds of hours of conversation were recorded over the course of 30 meetings with the undercover officer, police said. 'We need to arrest the police and take them to our jail and put them in a cell and put them on trial in a people's court,' Brutsche said on July 9, according to the arrest report. 'If we run into the position that they resist, then we need to kill them.' During a tour of gun stores the next day, Brutsche said that what they were planning was going to be big, 'and that they would really get a large following once they started because of the publicity,' the report said. Police said that when Brutsche was arrested, he denied that police had authority to hold him. Police identified Brutsche as a six-time convicted felon and child sex offender from California. Authorities did not detail a further criminal background for Newman. In Louisiana last year, police linked a sovereign citizen group to shootout that left two deputies dead and two others wounded. At least some of the seven people arrested were identified as sovereign citizen members. In Arkansas in 2010, a father and son identified as members of the group shot and killed two police officers before being killed by authorities in a separate shootout.","David Allen Brutsche and Devon Campbell Newman were arrested over 'domestic terrorism' plot in Las Vegas .

Under North Carolina law anyone aged 16 and above can be charged with first-degree murder as an adult. Following Blackmore’s plea, prosecutors reduced that charge, which could have resulted in a sentence of life in prison without parole. Blackmore was released from jail in .

When you have an audience with the President of the United States, it's worth making an impression - a concept that this little boy appears to have fully grasped. The toddler, who has not been identified, dropped to the floor of a cafe, for some attention-grabbing kicking and flailing while President Obama held an informal meeting on Thursday. Obama, who was meeting with college students and graduates alongside Education Secretary Arne Duncan, appeared not to have noticed the antics at Magnolia’s Deli & Café in Rochester, New York. Look at me! Obama, with Education Secretary Arne Duncan, talks with college students at Magnolia's Café, as a child plays on the floor, in Rochester, NY on Thursday . A woman sitting with a stroller at a table opposite the high-powered group appears to be the boy's mother as she laughs at his antics. Official White House photographer Pete Souza posted the picture on Twitter on Thursday with the words: 'A young boy plays as Pres Obama lunches with college students and their parents in Rochester, NY.' The President had lunch at the café and deli during his college affordability bus tour on Thursday. As his motorcade made its way from . Buffalo to Syracuse, the President stopped off in Rochester . to have lunch at a restaurant with a small group of college students, . recent graduates and their parents. He then made another pitch for his . college affordability proposals to a crowd of high school students, . parents and educators at Syracuse’s Henninger High School. Focused: Obama appeared not to see the toddler rolling around on the floor just in front of him as he ate lunch with college students and recent graduates in Rochester . Obama is touting a new program that will rate colleges by the expected income of their graduates, compared against the cost of tuition. Obama says the plan will help parents and students make better-informed decisions about higher education. But the proposed overhaul faced immediate . skepticism from college leaders who worry the rankings could cost their . institutions millions of dollars, as well as from congressional . Republicans wary of deepening the government’s role in higher education. The president, speaking to a . student-heavy crowd of 7,000 at the University at Buffalo, said he . expected pushback from those who have profited from the ballooning cost . of college. But he . argued that with the nation’s economy still shaky and students facing . increasing global competition, making college affordable is 'an economic . imperative'. 'Higher . education cannot be a luxury,' Obama said during the first stop on the . tour through New York and Pennsylvania. 'Every American family should be . able to get it.' Bus tour: Obama delivers remarks at the University of Buffalo in New York as he travels around to promote his plan to cut college costs . Republicans on Capitol Hill weighed in quickly with criticism. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the top Republican on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, cast the proposal as government overreach and suggested a state-by-state approach would be preferable. 'Washington needs to be careful about taking a good idea for one state and forcing all 6,000 institutions of higher education to do the exact same thing, turning Washington into a sort of national school board for our colleges and universities,' Alexander said. For colleges and universities, millions of federal aid dollars could be on the line if schools are downgraded under the government rating system. However, if colleges line up against the idea of tying ratings to federal aid, the proposal would face nearly impossible odds. Almost all members of Congress have colleges or universities in their districts, and a coordinated effort to rally students and educators against the plan would probably kill it quickly. 'This is extraordinarily complicated stuff, and it’s not clear we have the complete data or accurate data,' said Molly Corbett Broad, the president of the American Council on Education that represents colleges and universities in Washington. From Buffalo, Obama climbed aboard his armored black bus for a road trip that was to take him through western and central New York as well as northeastern Pennsylvania over two days. 'Ground Force One': Obama's bus drives through the streets of Syracuse after the president spoke about affordable college education at Henninger High School on Thursday . The education-focused trip underscores the degree to which the White House is seeking to keep the president’s public agenda focused on domestic issues, even as international crises flair in Egypt and Syria. 'As we’re weighing these domestic policy positions and foreign policy decisions, the president puts the interests of the United States of America first,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. 'The fact that we are doing this bus tour is an indication that the president has his priorities straight.' The education proposals are part of the broader economic agenda Obama has been pitching across the country this summer. The tour is aimed at building public support for his economic policies ahead of fiscal fights with Congress this fall. The rising cost of college has increasingly become a burden for many Americans. According to administration figures, the tuition costs at public, four-year universities has tripled over the last 30 years and average student loan debt stands at $26,000. Over the past five years, the tuition sticker price at public four-year colleges is up 27 per cent beyond overall inflation, according to a College Board survey. At private schools, the average student’s cost has risen 13 percent beyond overall inflation. Meet and greet: President Barack Obama shakes hands with Paul MacAulzy, 66, in Rochester, as he talks to patrons outside Magnolia's on Park Ave . There has been little consensus among policymakers on how to curb college costs. While Obama’s proposal could give colleges an incentive to slow increases, it could also add massive reporting requirements that could be a burden on schools already struggling to make ends meet. The new rating system does not require congressional approval, and the White House is aiming to have it set up before the 2015 school year. But Obama does need support from Congress in order to use the ratings as a basis for parceling out federal financial aid. In addition to tuition, schools will also be rated on average student loan debt, graduation rates and the average earnings of graduates. Under Obama’s proposal, students attending highly rated schools could receive larger grants and more affordable loans. The president is also seeking legislation to give colleges a 'bonus' based on the number of students they graduate who received Pell Grants. The goal is to encourage colleges to enroll and graduate low- and moderate-income students. Obama’s other proposals include a requirement that colleges with high dropout rates distribute student aid over the course of the semester rather than in a lump sum. The aim is to ensure that students who drop out do not receive funds for time they are not in school. The president also renewed his call for a $1 billion college 'Race to the Top' competition that would reward states that make significant changes in higher education policies while also containing tuition costs. For Obama, who has made no secret of his desire to get out of Washington when he can, the bus tours have become a favorite method for reconnecting with the public. Beyond his official events, the president often makes unscheduled stops at local restaurants and businesses, and sometimes pulls off on the side of the road to greet cheering crowds. On Friday, Obama plans to hold a town hall meeting at Binghamton University, then travel to Scranton, Pa., for an event at Lackawanna College. Vice President Joe Biden, a Scranton native, is to join Obama in his hometown. Biden has spent much of the week in Houston, where his son Beau underwent a medical procedure at a cancer center. The president’s highly secure bus was purchased by the Secret Service in 2011 for $1.1 million. The bus - unofficially known as 'Ground Force One' - has dark tinted windows and flashing red and blue lights.","Obama was meeting with college students, graduates and their parents at Magnolia Café in Rochester, New York ."

Mistrust: MPs criticised regulator Ofgem, run by CEO Alistair Buchanan (pictured) for failing to protect customers from profit-making firms . Energy companies have been blasted for ‘serious shortfalls’ in the way they explain price increases and bills  - leading to a ‘deep mistrust’ from customers unable to work out if they are getting a good deal. MPs said it was ‘astonishing’ that Ofgem had not taken on recommendations to improve energy company reporting or listened to criticism on how competition in the market is measured. The report - by the Energy and Climate Change Committee - was published as it emerged complaints from homeowners struggling with huge gas and electricity debts have soared to record highs - more than doubling in five years. Figures from charities revealed they are receiving thousands of calls from homeowners unable to pay their energy bills after being hit with large price hikes. Advice group National Debtline received more pleas for help from people about their gas and electric supplier than it did about payday loan companies or from homeowners who had fallen behind with their mortgage or rent. Many of the calls were from the elderly, some of whom owed thousands of pounds. The MPs also criticised energy firms for failing to be open about their huge profits and was also critical of regulator Ofgem for failing to protect consumers. Since 2007, the average price of gas and electricity have risen by 41 per cent and 20 per cent in the UK in real terms, according to the Department for Energy and Climate Change. Firms have introduced further hikes of up to 11per cent since the beginning of the year and experts warn of further price hikes. Meanwhile, the big six energy firms E.On, SSE, British Gas, Npower, EDF and Scottish Power have enjoyed bumper profits. The MPs on the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee have attacked these giants for ‘serious shortfalls’ in the way they explained price increases and bills  - leading to a ‘deep mistrust’ from customers who were unable to work out whether or not they were getting a good deal. Complaints: The number of people struggling with gas and electricity debts has more than doubled in the last five years . According to figures from National .

Sarah Harrison, senior partner at Ofgem, said the watchdog rejected any suggestion that it was falling down on the job. ‘We are here with one goal in mind, which is to protect customers, and we will use the full range of powers we have got to do that,’ she said. ‘That includes taking penalty action against companies who fail their customers - and they do.’ Last night Paul Crayston, a spokesman for National Debtline, said: ‘Undoubtedly the huge bill increases – which have far surpassed any rises in wages are to blame for the increase in people to unable to cope.

Ordeal: Dyer was attacked by a bear that crossed an electric fence designed to protect his group . Wells told the Sun Journal newspaper of Lewiston that Dyer, of Turner, has retained his sense of humor even though he remains immobilized and cannot speak. Dyer's neck remains immobilized to keep the fractures stable, and a breathing tube is in place to ensure that swelling doesn't interfere with breathing, she said. Dyer, a lawyer with Pine Tree Legal Services, was attacked on Wednesday. As of Sunday, he remained in critical but stable condition. The hospital had no further updates Monday. Dyer was part of a seven-man group on a guided tour of Torngat National Park on the northern tip of Newfoundland when the attack happened.

Dyer’s group was sleeping behind . their protective fence when the single polar bear attacked them at about . 1:30am on Wednesday morning. The bear dragged Dyer from his tent and was mauling him when his friends fired flares to scare the bear which dropped him and ran off. It then took several hours for the group to could contact the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. A . helicopter stationed at Saglek Fjord, about an hour flight away, was . sent to the area and then took Dyer to a trauma clinic in Quebec. He was later transferred to Montreal . General Hospital. Torngat National Park is a 3,700-square-mile Canadian National Park in Newfoundland and is home to seal-hunting polar bears, caribou and remnant glaciers . Wells was informed of the attack on Wednesday afternoon and flew to Montreal. ‘The Canadians did an amazing job of getting him transported. There was a doctor in the group who took care of him right from the start,' she told the Bangor Daily News over the weekend. 'He is in very stable condition. He will make a full recovery and that is a testament to his strength.' Authorities are investigating how the attack happened and if there was an issue with the group's protective fence. A spokesperson for the park said this is the first time an attack like this has happened since it opened in 2005.

German school children as young as five were given a sex-education book giving graphic advice on how to put on a condom and how to achieve orgasms. Outraged parents complained when youngsters at a school in Berlin were given the book, called 'Where Do You Come From?', which features explicit cartoon depictions of sex. The book, which shows a couple called Lisa and Lars engaging in various of stages of intercourse, shows Lisa putting a condom on Lars and another image of the pair having sex. Explicit: Parents were left outraged after a school in Germany gave sex education books featuring explicit images to children as young as five . Instructions: One of the pictures in the book, which features Lisa and Lars, shows Lisa putting a condom on Lars . Outrage: Children as young as five at a German school were given access to an explicit sex education book which teaches how to put on condoms and how to achieve orgasms (picture posed by actors) According to Spiegel Online, the school in the Kreuzberg area of Berlin did not initially respond to parents' complaints. It was only when the local press got wind of the controversy and complaints were made to the city's governing body, the Berlin Senate, that anything was done. The book is still said to be available at the school but not readily accessible by pupils. Parents were not only concerned by the images featured in the book, but also by some of the explicit descriptions used. The book, aimed at educating children aged five years and upwards, reads: 'When it's so good that it can't get any better, Lisa and Lars have an orgasm,' and 'the vagina and penis feel nice and tingly and warm.' Rude: The book features a variety of images featuring Lisa and Lars having sex . Two raunchy: The book is to be replaced with a toned down, modernised version . Politician Dorothee Baer of the Christian Social Union party in Bavaria said: 'Sex education should accompany the development of children, but not speed it up.' Monika Grutters from the Christian Democratic Union Party told the Die Welt newspaper that she is against 'unnecessary zeal' in sex education. Where Do You Come From? was first published by Loewe Verlag in association with German family planning group Pro Familia in 1991. The publishing house said that the book is no longer being produced as some of its messages are out of date and added that it is being replaced with a book called 'Was I in Mummy's Stomach Too?' which the publishers say is less explicit. The outrage comes as teachers in the UK have been encouraged to introduce pornography into the classroom, using sex education lessons to explain that porn is 'not all bad' and 'hugely diverse'. The recommendations, included in an educational guide, suggest that teachers confront 'myths' about porn and inform children as young as five about sexualisation. The guidance could have significant influence in British schools after the Government's decision to keep sex education lessons voluntary, leaving schools to devise their own ways of teaching the subject.","The book, called 'Where Do You Come From?', sparked outrage .

A controversial ‘Go home, or face arrest’ poster campaign is not ‘racist’ and could be extended across the country, the immigration minister says today. Mark Harper launches a strong attack on critics of the Home Office billboards, claiming they are encouraging those who are in the country illegally to go on breaking the law. ‘No society that encourages people to break its laws can survive,’ Mr Harper writes. ‘That, however, is precisely what our critics are asking us to do. They say we should not try to persuade illegal immigrants to leave.’ 'Go home': The campaign, piloted in six London boroughs, involves vans advertising a telephone helpline for illegal migrants who want to leave the UK voluntarily . The Tory minister adds that immigration has not had the economic benefits that Labour claimed, insisting there is evidence it has pushed down wages for low-skilled jobs. The campaign, piloted in six London boroughs, involves vans advertising a telephone helpline for illegal migrants who want to leave the UK voluntarily. But it prompted an angry Coalition row, with the Lib Dem business secretary, Vince Cable, describing it as ‘stupid and offensive’. Union leaders have branded the campaign a ‘nasty political stunt’. Downing Street insisted the posters were attracting ‘a great deal of interest’ and confirmed that an evaluation of the pilot scheme could lead to it being rolled out more widely. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said: ‘This pilot that is currently running is about targeting [illegal immigrants] and it is working.’ Campaign: Immigration minister Mark Harper launched a strong attack on critics of the Home Office billboards, claiming they are encouraging those who are in the country illegally to go on breaking the law . Boris Johnson, mayor of London, defended the campaign, describing it as ‘blunt’ and ‘uncompromising’. He disagreed with suggestions it was . racist, adding: ‘On that point I am afraid I have to disagree. Illegal . immigrants have every opportunity to make their case to remain in . Britain. 'No society that encourages people to break its laws can survive. That, however, is precisely what our critics are asking us to do. They say we should not try to persuade illegal immigrants to leave' Mark Harper, immigration minister . ‘This poster campaign is unlikely, in itself, to solve the problem that expanded so massively under the last Labour government. But you surely can’t blame the Coalition for trying to enforce the law.’ Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, said it was ‘far from clear how any success could even be measured’. He added: ‘The truth is this is not a policy that could or will be analysed for its effectiveness, it is simply a nasty political stunt by the Tories and it is a disgrace that the Home Office is allowing itself to be used in this way.’ Supportive: Boris Johnson (pictured last Thursday) mayor of London, defended the campaign, describing it as 'blunt' and 'uncompromising' A Lib Dem source dismissed Tory suggestions that the campaign had been agreed by a Home Office  ‘team’ that included Lib Dem minister Jeremy Browne, saying: ‘We did not see or approve these posters, which we see as distasteful and not very sensible. 'It is simply a nasty political stunt by the Tories and it is a disgrace that the Home Office is allowing itself to be used in this way' Mark Serwotka, Public and Commercial Services Union . ‘We would need a spectacular amount of convincing that it would be a good idea to expand this across the country.’ Labour said the Coalition’s success in reducing net migration was largely due to cuts in the numbers of foreign students and larger numbers of Britons emigrating to other countries. Another Coalition row erupted last night as Vince Cable attacked Government plans for visitors from ‘high risk’ countries to be charged a £3,000 bond. The scheme will see some people from India, Nigeria, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh asked to pay a cash bond on top of visa charges that allow them to stay for up to six months. It will only be repayable when they leave the UK.","Mark Harper launches strong attack on critics of Home Office billboards .

Hard-partying Heisman winner Johnny Manziel was at it again on Friday when he showed up to a University of Texas frat party, only to be kicked out and show up at a second event on Saturday. The controversial quarterback likely stirred ire when he showed up to the party, since he’s the star player for Texas A&M – one of UT’s biggest rivals. What’s more, Manziel did his partying while wearing a Tim Tebow New York Jets Jersey after being told by his critics over the course of his high-profile summer break that he should be more like Christian minded Jets star turned Patriots player. Fraternizing: Hard-partying Heisman trophy winner Johnny Maziel kept the booze train going this weekend with a stop in Austin for some University of Texas frat partying . According to Deadspin, a Youtube video shows Manziel’s make a hasty exit from a University of Texas frat party in Austin. Someone yells ‘Get the f**k out!’ and a beer can is clearly lobbed at the unwitting football star. He looks to be in high spirits as he leaves, nonetheless. And there’s no surprise there. He’s had a fun-filled summer thus far, one in which he was kicked out of a summer football camp, as well. Rivals: A Youtube video claims to show Manziel leaving a  University of Texas frat party on Friday amid jeers from the partygoers, whose school is an arch rival of the Heisman's winner's Texas A&M. A beer can can just barely be seen hurling toward Manziel, at left . Hasty retreat? Manziel left in a seemingly happy mood and didn't hesitate to attend yet another University of Texas party the following day . The rising football star was sent home from the Manning Passing Academy in Hibodaux, Louisiana, on earlier this month by ‘Archie Manning himself’ after allegedly spending a night out on the town and showing up late to some scheduled events the next day. The news of his ‘late-night partying’ was first reported by Rumors and Rants over the weekend, while Busted Coverage released photos of Manziel, 20, out drinking with Eli and Peyton Manning. Camp officials told local reporters that Manziel was ‘sick’ and had to leave early, while his father maintained that he came home to recover from dehydration. So there: In an apparent jab at critics who've been telling him to behave more like the goodly Tim Tebow this summer, Manziel wore the former Jets player's jersey to a second party this weekend . Manziel was working as counselor at the camp, which helps develop high school football players, before he left early. So, when the booze-loving athlete showed up to a second day of partying in Austin on Saturday wearing goodly Tim Tebow’s old Jets jersey, it’s no wonder reports portrayed it as a brazen jab at his critics. ‘The only way Johnny Football could give a bigger ""F U"" to the national media's recent coverage of him would be by rocking a Tim Tebow Jets jersey,’ wrote a sarcastic Fox Sports. ‘Wait... what!?!?!’ King of Spring Break: Pictures like this one, taken in March while Manziel partied in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, had the press calling 'Johnny Football' by a different name . Many wondered where Manziel's girlfriend Sarah Savage was when he was partying with lovely ladies in Mexico last March . Going strong: The Heisman trophy winner's Spring Break antics now seem to have been just the start of Johnny Football's off season partying . Manziel’s antics this summer are not his first. The player who’s nickname has become a registered trademark received a different nickname of sorts back in March: King of Spring Break. Pictures at the time showed the football star partying hard with friends in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico—accompanied by either bottles of liquor or scantily clad co-eds in just about every photo taken of him.","Video shows Texas A&M Heisman winner Johnny Manziel get booed out of a frat party at rival school University of Texas as his summer partying rolls on .

This is a pivot for Romney, who has previously said at different points that the statements were ‘not elegantly stated’ and ‘completely wrong.’ Misinterpreted? Mitt Romney admits his 2012 presidential bid was heavily damaged by his '47 percent' remarks at a meeting with donors in Florida but now characterizes them as taken out of context . The presidential also-ran and one-time governor of Massachusetts voiced his new stance on the issue during a long sit down with the Washington Post published Saturday. The controversial comments were made during a closed-door meeting with donors in Florida in the September before last year’s presidential elections. When a donor asked Romney how he intended to beat Barack Obama, he responded: . ‘There are 47 percent who are with [Obama], who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it.’ Get outta here: 'Actually, I didn't say that' was Romney's recently published response to questions about his taped comments that '47 percent of people...who are dependent on government, who believe they are victims' would be voting for Obama .

Service: 111 was introduced this spring to provide non-emergency medical advice 24 hours a day . The NHS 111 helpline was plunged deeper into crisis last night after a contractor responsible for up to 20million patients suddenly pulled-out due to ‘financial problems’. NHS Direct said it would be terminating all 11 of its contracts after admitting it had racked up debts of £26million – and said running the helpline was ‘financially unsustainable’. There are concerns the taxpayer now faces a huge new bill to bail out the helpline as the NHS Direct contracts may end up being re-drawn to pay for higher numbers of staff. Two reviews which are due to report back this autumn could demand that the system employs higher numbers of nurses as well as call centre handlers. It is the latest controversy to blight the 111 service, which was launched in April to provide patients with a simple way of seeking medical advice round-the-clock. It was hampered by problems from the start with reports of critically ill patients waiting hours for a doctor and ambulances sent out needlessly for period pains and hangovers. Scroll down for video . Response: The call centres are manned typically by around 60 unqualified workers and up to 15 nurses. Staff numbers decline dramatically during the unpopular night and weekend shifts (file picture) The lines are manned by unqualified . workers – some even including teenagers – with just two weeks’ training, . who transfer more serious calls on to a handful of nurses seated . nearby. The crisis engulfing 111 has piled the pressure on Dame Barbara Hakin (right), deputy chief executive of the NHS, who is meant to be overseeing the helpline. One of the most powerful women in the NHS, she was promoted into the £120,000 role in March – despite accusations that she gagged whistleblowers and attempted to cover up hospital death rates. The 60-year-old former GP is being investigated by the General Medical Council over claims that she shelved an investigation into needless patient deaths at United Lincolnshire Hospitals three years ago. She is also accused of trying to sack whistleblower Gary Walker, the chief executive of the trust, who was trying to raise concerns that patients were at risk. If found guilty she could be struck off as a doctor, although she no longer practises. Dame Barbara, who was made a dame in 2009 for her ‘services to healthcare’ was appointed to be deputy chief executive by the much-criticised head of the NHS, Sir David Nicholson, without consulting Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. NHS Direct is also understood to have . underestimated the number of staff, including nurses, that it would need . to field the calls. It has since been forced to hire many more staff . just to make the service safe which has drastically increased the . running costs. Furthermore, it originally based its . bids on a projected payment of £13 a call to cover costs. But rates were . cut by NHS bosses to between £7 and £8. Yesterday the organisation, which runs . NHS 111 in 11 of the 46 areas of England, announced it was terminating . its contracts, which cover areas including Manchester, South London, the . West Midlands, Merseyside, Cheshire and Somerset. Its announcement came . as: . The remaining NHS 111 contracts are run by the private firm Harmoni, the ambulance service and other health service bodies. NHS bosses have been holding talks . with local ambulance services and GP organisations to find bodies to . take over the 11 NHS Direct contracts. Both David Cameron and health minister . Lord Howe insisted patient safety would remain ‘paramount’ and said NHS . Direct would continue to run the service for the next few months. Lord Howe said 111 was performing well . despite ‘teething problems’ in some areas as he accused NHS Direct of . getting their sums ‘very wrong’. He claimed problems with the service were mainly confined to the West Country, Kent, Surrey and Sussex. ‘For the vast majority of the country . the service is excellent,’ he said, adding: ‘NHS Direct bid for a . service at a price they thought they could meet, and they got it very . wrong.’ Former Labour health secretary John . Reid said 111 was in ‘turmoil’. Addressing the House of Lords, he added: . ‘The deterioration in our accident and emergency services is getting . exponentially greater. Trolley waits are back and predicted to . potentially reach crisis point.’ The 111 helpline is currently being . reviewed by NHS England – the body in charge of running the health . service – and by the NHS’s medical director Sir Bruce  Keogh.

Nineteen years after the shooting death of a high school junior in Jersey Village, Texas, her boyfriend is being charged with the crime. Christopher Stoernell, 36-years-old and now living in Michigan, was arrested last week and charged with murdering his then 17-year-old girlfriend Ruth Majewski. The charges come after her family asked to have the case reopened two years ago. Justice begins: Christopher Stoernell, right, was arrested and charged today for the 1994 murder of his high school girlfriend, then 17-year-old Ruth Majewski, left . 'We thought that he killed her,' Ruth's father Richard Majewski said. 'And that’s what we thought all along. But I guess we didn’t pique enough interest at the time.' Ruth died after going over to Stoernell's mother's home on September 30, 1994. Five other teens were there, between the ages of 15 and 19, when they somehow came into the possession of a loaded gun. The kids were playing around with the gun, and Stoernell allegedly pointed it at his friends and jokingly pretended to shoot. Ruth was later discovered in a bedroom dead from a gunshot wound and her boyfriend was assumed to be with her at the time. 'He told law enforcement at the time that it was a suicide and/or an accidental shooting,' Sgt Eric Clegg of the Harris County Sheriff's Office told KHOU. Ruth's case remained cold until her parents pleaded that it be reopened again two years ago. The HSCO's Cold Case Unit took up the case, re-interviewing witnesses and analyzing old evidence, and found the evidence countered the self-inflicted gunshot theory. This it the 18th case the unit has solved since it was formed in 2009. Now Ruth's parents look forward to seeing the man they suspected all along stand trial. Mr Majewski hopes it will finally give them answers or a motive for their daughter's killing. After being charged with Ruth's murder, Stoernell was released and is currently free on $50,000 bail.","Ruth Majewski was 17-years-old when she was found shot to death in a bedroom at her boyfriend's house .

RAF pilots took part in America’s notorious drone programme in Iraq in which hundreds of civilians died, The Mail on Sunday has learned. Heavily armed drones – using deadly missiles to destroy targets – were flying as many as three  missions a week from 2004. They were operated remotely by pilots, often from bases thousands of miles away. Threat: An unmaned reaper drone believed to have been used by the RAF in Iraq . It had been thought the operations in Iraq, which have been condemned by human rights groups as war crimes, were run solely by the US Air Force. Now the Ministry of Defence has admitted for the first time that British personnel were helping to fly the drones from bases in the United States. In a statement to Parliament, Armed Forces Minister Andrew Robathan was forced to correct a previous account in which he said the RAF flew US drones only in Afghanistan and Libya. He said: ‘The answer should have said that UK personnel embedded with the US Air Force have only flown US RPAS [Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems] in support of operations in Afghanistan, Libya and Iraq.’ The MoD conceded that these embedded missions ran from 2004 to 2009, but a spokesman was unable to provide further details. One intelligence source said British pilots would have worked on drone operations in Basra, using Hellfire missiles to target insurgents fighting UK forces. Women sob after a fatal drone attack north of Baghdad in Iraq . US drone operations follow looser rules of engagement than those authorised by the UK. US drones abide by the controversial doctrine of ‘pre-emptive self-defence’ – for targeted killings over countries such as Pakistan and Yemen. However, the MoD said British pilots followed UK combat rules, even when embedded with US forces. Reacting to the news, Tory MP Rehman Chishti said: ‘This raises serious questions about our involvement with America’s drone programme and our role during the insurgency. The Government must lift the veil of secrecy on their use of drones.’ The MoD also admitted that Reaper drones have been operated remotely from Britain for the first time. The Reapers had flown missions in Afghanistan controlled from RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire, where campaign groups yesterday staged a protest against the news. The drones are all based in Afghanistan and can carry 500lb bombs and Hellfire missiles. They are launched from Kandahar air base.

"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 22:47 EST, 30 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:10 EST, 31 July 2013 . A damning study by MPs has found that pupils are getting less than two hours of PE lessons a week. The education select committee questioned more than 300 primary and secondary school teachers, less than half of whom claimed that school children have two hour of sports education each week. Just 43 per cent said pupils enjoyed two hours of physical work a week, compared to 90 per cent in the academic year 2007 - 2008, when the sports survey was carried out under Labour's government. Teachers' comments suggested that a full curriculum meant PE was often sacrificed in order to meet the criteria of the timetable . The figures suggests that since the Coalition came to power in 2010, the number of children having at least two hours worth of sport lessons has halved, the Daily Telegraph reported. The Telegraph reported that teachers' comments suggested that a full curriculum meant PE was often sacrificed in order to meet the criteria of the timetable. But the Department of Education said to compare with it the survey conducted in 2008 was 'ridiculous' because the earlier study spoke to more than 21,000 schools and asked different questions. A spokesman said: 'It is ridiculous to compare a scientific research study of more than 21,000 schools to a self-selecting survey of just over 300, and each with completely different questions.' The survey comes after comments made by Baroness Campbell, the head of the Youth Sport Trust, earlier this year. The Coalition has emphasised it's commitment to reforming sport in schools to create a lasting Olympic legacy . She claimed that many children starting secondary school  were unable to throw a ball, catch, jump or run. She . said that even pupils inspired to take up a sport after watching the . Olympics missed out because teachers were not well trained enough to . help them. The Coalition has emphasised it's commitment to reforming sport in schools to create a lasting Olympic legacy. In 2010 the Government said that far . too few children were participating in regular competitive sport and . that schools be given the freedom to organise more competitive sport. Ministers want to encourage more competitive sport so it is a vibrant part of the ethos of all schools. Earlier this month Lord Coe helped launch a new £150 million grant for school sports facilities. The investment comes as the Government unveils plans to train teachers to specialise in PE at primary school. Lord Coe said: 'The problem in primary schools is that PE has become too much of a lottery. If you have a head teacher – male or female – who understands sport then probably you’ll have  a better chance of getting good provision. 'But if their experience of sport was not good then that tends to filter through the school. It occurred to me that the big gap in provision was in primary schools.' However, in a direct contrast the Government's goal of creating more a more competitive atmosphere when it came to physical games, last week a group of MPs warned that such sports put some children off exercise for life and primary schools should be told to offer less taxing alternatives. Safeguarding Britain’s Olympic legacy is about allowing as many children as possible to enjoy the health benefits of sport through non-competitive activities, they said in a report published on July 22. The Commons Education Committee warned that competitive team sports have a ‘limited appeal’ to some children and politicians’ focus on them can be ‘counter-productive’. But the committee of MPs urged the Department for Education to make clear to schools that there should also be non-competitive activities to increase the wellbeing of all children, and help control obesity.","300 teachers questioned in study by education select committee .

Catina, Jalen and Aaliyah are among the most popular baby names from the twentieth century - and they are all based on well-known personalities of their time. A new study has revealed the 10 girls and boys names that saw the biggest spikes in the 1900s, and through-out the years it was always star sportsmen, famous actors and actresses and even military chiefs who captured the imagination of parents. In 1937, the most trendy name given to baby girls was Deanna. At that time Deanna Durbin was an actress who often played the model daughter in films and TV shows. Top 10: These are the top trendiest boys and girls names according Flowing Data . Looking back on 2013, data may reveal a . huge spike in certain unusual names. Perhaps Barack,  Beyonce, or even . Snooki may briefly flare in popularity before returning to obscurity. Flowing Data used the Social Security Administration's data to track the trendiest names of the past century, and the results are interesting in that they can almost always be directly linked to events or popular culture of the time. There are always 'regular' names, such as Sophia, Matthew, Mary or John, that maintain a certain level of use. It's the more unusual names that go from nothing to hugely popular and back again that Flowing Data is interested in. Popular: The name of Zoe Saldana's Colombiana character Cataleya (left) peaked in 2012, while girls called Aaliyah (right) are likely to have been born in 1994 . 'If a small percentage of the baby population was given a name one year and a relatively much higher percentage of the next year's baby population got said name, we consider that a trendy name,' according to Flowing Data. The website used a mathematical equation to find out which names had the highest 'relative risk' - the probability of a name being used that generally has a low likelihood statistically. Many of the names that proved the most trendy can be easily linked to contemporary events. Wishful thinking: Deanna Durbin (left) often played the ideal daughter and her name was given to many girls in 1937, while Woodrow Wilson (right) was the namesake of boys the year he was elected President . The number one most trendy girl name was Catina, which reached its peak in 1972, when a character in the popular soap Where the Heart is gave birth to a baby girl and named her Katina. The name Dustin spiked in 1967, the year Dustin Hoffman starred in the film The Graduate. The name Dawson reached its high the year the hugely popular Dawson's Creek debuted on television. Many baby girls were named Aja in 1978, the year the Steely Dan album Aja came out. 1978: The Steely Dan album release coincided with a jump in baby girls named Aja . And Yulissa spiked in 1997, another soap opera name from the Mexican telenovela Te Sigo Amando. There was a jump in boys with the unusual name of Woodrow in 1913, the year Woodrow Wilson was elected President. Other names aren't as easy to place. In 2005, there was a spike in baby boys who were named Talan, which Flowing Data tentatively puts down to Talan Torriero, a 'star' of the reality television show Laguna Beach. The popularity of the name Deneen rose in 1964, but the analyst of the data couldn't put forth a candidate from whom the name might have gained it popularity. Flowing Data also noted a trend for uniqueness in the past few decades, meaning people are using more unique names than ever before.

To see the future of Dollywood, you need to borrow the vision of its chief imaginer, Dolly Parton. In the near future, Parton sees a resort hotel lobby with a three-story window that frames Mount LeConte - one of the tallest peaks in the Smoky Mountains. Guests will be able to book a grand suite in the hotel that the entertainer uses when she stays in the Pigeon Forge theme park that bears her name. All of that is future tense, but not very far away. The park plans to open DreamMore Resort in 2015. It's part of a planned $300 million expansion to take place over the next decade. This artist rendering shows a version of Dolly Parton's proposed hotel with an outdoor pool planned for in the Smoky Mountains in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee . The park plans to open DreamMore Resort in 2015. It's part of a planned $300 million expansion to take place over the next decade . A new roller coaster, this one aimed at families, is scheduled to open in 2014. The resort hotel has been Parton's dream ever since she affixed her name to the theme park 28 years ago. 'The thing we're most excited about is finally building our resort,' Parton said Friday by telephone from the park in the Smokies foothills. 'We're starting out with a resort that has 300 rooms,' Parton said. 'Some of the rooms will accommodate up to six people in a family.' There will be a lot of 'front porch spaces' at the resort. Parton noted that during her upbringing nearby, people tended to congregate on front porches or in the kitchen. A fishing pond will be on the property where children can catch their first whopper and there will be fire pits where families can roast marshmallows. Dolly Parton speaks during a news conference to announce plans to expand her Dollywood properties on Wednesday . A fishing pond will be on the property where children can catch their first whopper and there will be fire pits where families can roast marshmallows . People walking into the lobby will be greeted with a glass of lemonade in the summer and a cup of hot chocolate during winter months. The total dollar investment in the next decade will exceed the company's spending on Dollywood so far, said Craig Ross, president. 'In 10 years' time, we will have spent more than we've spent since the inception back in 1986...' Ross said. The plan includes multiple additional resorts as well as more rides and shows. 'It's the bigger scope of these attractions that we'll be adding that's different,' Ross said. The first of the new attractions will be Fire Chaser Express, scheduled to open next year. It's a ride described as exciting, but not as intense as the Wild Eagle or Dollywood's water coaster, RiverRush. Children of elementary school age will be able to ride it. Visitors try out the new RiverRush ride at Dollywood theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee . Research by Dollywood showed executives the resort will make a difference for many people looking to vacation in the mountains. A survey showed 80 percent of people asked about visiting the theme park, who had not yet come, indicated having a resort on the property would be important to them. Dollywood is putting up a new website, www.dreammoreresort.com, to help market the hotel, even as it is under construction. Leon Downey, executive director of the Pigeon Forge Department of Tourism, emphasized the importance of the Dollywood expansion. 'We're basically 100 percent tourism' Downey said. 'It's the only industry we have.' On an average day, there will be 50,000 guests in Pigeon Forge - a small city with a permanent population of 5,784. The announcement by Dollywood is exciting for the town. 'It makes all of us in the city smile,' Downey said 'Every year Dollywood has a new announcement, but this one is so big it dwarfs all the others.' This Jan. 19, 2012 file photo shows entertainer Dolly Parton during a news conference in Nashville, Tenn., to announce plans for a water-snow park . The Sevier County where Parton grew up was mostly hardscrabble farming and a few summer forays into selling trinkets to tourists. She is proud to be part of the transformation of the mountains gateway community. Her success as a country music artist and an actress has pulled her to Hollywood and many overseas locations. She is preparing for another European tour now. But the mountains will always be home, Parton said, and she's glad to bring employment there. 'It is the most amazing feeling,' Parton said. 'People say you can't go home again. Well, I've certainly proved that wrong.' Parton said the nearby Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a magnet that has drawn visitors for decades. Visitation to the national park averages more than 9 million people a year. Dollywood is positioning itself as a tourist destination in itself, even as it shares many of its visitors with the black bears and grand vistas of the Smokies. 'The national park has always been great for campers,' Parton said. 'But people come and sometimes they like to say 'well, let's get out of these woods for a minute and let's go down to Dollywood.''","The park plans to open DreamMore Resort in 2015 .

The father of an unarmed man shot by a transit worker can sue the officer after a Tuesday court ruling. A federal appeals court in California said Tuesday that the father of Oscar Grant can sue the Bay Area Rapid Transit officer responsible for the 22-year-old’s 2009 shooting death on an Oakland, CA, train platform during a fight. Five of Grant’s friends were arrested during the dust up. The lawsuit was made possible when the court struck down a claim by former officer Johannes Mehserle that he was acting in his official capacity, granting him police immunity, according to the San Jose Mercury News. Shot dead: 22-year-old Oscar Grant was unarmed when he was shot dead by a BART officer his family is suing for violating his civil rights . ‘It is possible, after weighing all the facts, that the officers committed no constitutional wrongs,’ Judge Mary Murguia wrote in her ruling. ""But our task at this stage... is instead to construe the facts in the manner most favorable to the plaintiffs, who have a right to their day in court,’ she continued. Mr. Mehserle was convicted in 2010 on involuntary manslaughter in a trial that had to be held in Los Angeles, CA, because a fair trial would have been difficult due to widespread media coverage of the incident. He served 11 months in prison. Video of the white officer shooting . the unarmed black man in the back as he lay face down on the train . platform was viewed by millions and led to widespread demonstrations. The . officer contended during the trial that he thought he had pulled out . his Taser, not his gun, when he fired at Mr. Grant, and lawyers for . other involved officers claimed the officers were acting within their . rights in their response to fighting at the train station. Manslaughter: Former BART officer Johannes Mehserle pictured during his booking on January 13, 2009, he was later convicted of involuntary manslaughter and served 11 months in prison . Mr. Grant’s father and the five friends arrested during the New Year’s Day incident all sued, saying the officer had to pay damages for the unarmed man’s death, as well as for violating the civil rights of his five friends, according to the paper. The lawsuit alleges that the group of six was targeted and mistreated as a result of racial profiling in violation of their civil rights, according to the paper. It will now be up to a civil court to determine if Mr. Mehserle was justified in shooting Mr. Grant, and if the other men’s civil rights were violated.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki confirmed in her press briefing on Thursday that earlier in the week Ms Powers attended a National Security Council meeting that President Obama called to deal with the crisis in Egypt. Fox News is reporting that the 42-year-old married mother of two is in Ireland with her family. Power was born in Ireland and lived there until she was 9-years-old when she moved with her family to Atlanta, Georgia. Her relatives still live in Ireland. CNN has now reported that she has come home and participated in National Security Council meetings remotely. Conservative commentators for Fox News called on Ms Power to reveal her location publicly, saying that . 'Just say where she is. It looks like she's just on vacation. If she is, who cares? Everyone is in August. They should admit it,' Daily Caller editor and Fox commentator Tucker Carlson said. Close ties: Before being appointed to the United Nations, she worked on the National Security Council and as a part of President Obama's re-election campaign (seen here in June) 'I hope the new Ambassador has a really good reason for her absence. Secret trip for UN business? Good reasons I understand,' Fox host Greta Van Susteren wrote on her blog. While she would not have been able to fly back to the United States in time for the emergency meeting, a deputy attended in her place and she is reportedly staying briefed. 'Reports devastating: 100s dead in streets, including kids killed by chem weapons. UN must get there fast & if true, perps must face justice,' she posted on Twitter on Wednesday.

Prosecutor Alisdair Smith told the court about the alleged rape attack: 'The complainant was minding her own business when the defendant made sexual advances' he told the jury. 'She begged him to leave her alone but the prosecution say he just ignored that and raped her.' 'It's perfectly plain, the prosecution say, that the defendant knew she would not have consented.' Describing the chance meeting at the pub, Mr Smith added: 'The complainant's daughter became aware of a man staring at her mother. 'When the woman saw the man, it seems she was visibly shaken by this. It led to an allegation being made against Mr Plummer there and then in the pub. 'He was confronted and inevitably, you may think, tempers became frayed. There was a fight and police were called. That did lead to the complainant making the allegation (of rape) to police.' Plummer was arrested in September 2011, when he denied that he had ever raped the woman. He said the rape claims had been invented to cover up an assault on him at the pub.

A British soldier risked his life in Afghanistan by covering a booby-trap bomb with his body to try to save a wounded comrade. Warrant Officer Class One (WO1) Andy Peat heroically used himself as a human shield to protect rescuers from triggering another improvised explosive device (IED). The bomb disposal expert positioned himself just a foot above the explosive so colleagues could evacuate the Danish casualty. Stretcher bearers had to pass so close to the Taliban bomb that WO1 Peat feared they would accidentally step on it unless he screened it with his body. Despite knowing he would bear the brunt of any blast the 39-year-old remained motionless until the soldiers had clambered over him. Commanders said his heroism ‘saved a number of lives’. Now WO1 Peat, who serves with 33 Engineer Regiment, has been honoured by Denmark for his ‘extraordinary’ bravery. He is the first soldier outside the Danish military to receive the prestigious Anders Lassen Award from Crown Prince Frederik. WO1 Peat was supporting a joint Danish-Afghan patrol in January when the group was blasted by an IED in Helmand’s Upper Gereshk Valley. The explosion inflicted terrible injuries on Oversergeant Rene Brink Jakobsen, a member of the Danish Special Forces, who lost both legs and an arm. WO1 Peat discovered the unit was surrounded by at least ten more IEDs – including one underneath the injured soldier. He managed to disarm the device by cutting its wires. Hero: WO1 Peat was honoured by HRH Prince Frederik Andre Henrik Christian, Prince of Denmark for his action in Afghanistan . But as three Danish comrades struggled to stretcher WO1 Brink Jakobsen off a 14ft roof, WO1 Peat was alarmed to see another IED close to the escape path. He told the Mail: ‘The bottom line was if someone had initiated the device, it would have wiped out everyone. ‘My priority was ensuring no-one initiated the IED but in the back of my mind I was aware that if it went off, I would be taking the force of it.’ Poignant: Andy Peat laying a wreath at the wall of remembrance after he was awarded a citation from HRH Prince Frederik of Denmark . Tragically WO1 Brink Jakobsen later died of his wounds, leaving a wife and young family. But WO1 Peat, a married father-of-one from Edinburgh, was praised for saving the lives of another Danish soldier plus five Afghan policemen. He received his award at the Royal Danish Military College in Copenhagen. The Anders Lassen Foundation was established in memory of a soldier awarded the Military Cross and two bars and was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross in the Second World War. Each year the foundation chooses a single recipient for its honour and cash award. WO1 Peat was selected for his ‘extraordinary courage and determined actions’. Casualty: Rene Brink Jakobsen lost both legs and an arm . In a touching gesture, he donated the 25,000 krone – £3,000 – award to his dead colleague’s wife, Camilla, and three children, Sara, Maja and Thor. He said: ‘I was slightly taken aback when I had the phone call to say I’d been awarded it – it’s a great honour.’ WO1 Peat received a mention in despatches in 2007 for his bravery on the battlefield. He said: ‘If you take any IED operator and put him in front of the same predicament, all the guys would have done exactly the same thing. 'To be honest, it’s just about doing your job and thinking about what you’ve got in front of you and trying your best to get out of that predicament as quickly as possible.’ Mrs Brink Jakobsen said: ‘I really appreciate what he did and I’m very grateful that he would think of us in this way.’ Lieutenant Colonel Claus Wannen, head of the Danish Special Forces, said: ‘We’re very picky about who we want to actually have the award. WO1 Peat made an extraordinary contribution. 'On that tragic day he proved his worth and it’s most likely he saved a number of lives that evening.’","Warrant Officer Andy Peat screened Taliban bomb in Afghanistan with his body to stop others stepping on it .

"By . Nina Golgowski, Daily Mail Reporter and Ap . UPDATED: . 04:06 EST, 31 July 2013 . A New Jersey woman pleaded guilty on Tuesday to charges that she threw her emaciated pit bull puppy down a garbage shoot and left it for dead. The Essex County Prosecutor's Office said Kisha Curtis pleaded guilty to fourth-degree animal cruelty. She also gave up custody of the dog. Curtis was set to go to trial on Wednesday. Kisha Curtis, 29, no faces up to 18 months in prison. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Abuse: Kisha Curtis, 29, left, has denied ever abusing the dog since named Patrick, right, after it was found a day before St Patrick’s day at the bottom of a trash cute in 2011 weighing only 19lbs . Recovery: Patrick the pit bull is seen during his recovery in the days after Curtis says she merely left him in the hallway without ever abusing him . Curtis has denied ever abusing the dog, since named Patrick, after he was found a day before St Patrick’s day in 2011 weighing a shocking 19lbs. She claimed that she left the puppy in a hallway before it was found by someone else in the bottom of a trash shoot bone thin, curled in a ball and near death. The dog has since miraculously made a full recovery while now weighing a remarkable 50lbs after he was discovered moments before the trash compactor would have killed him. What a difference! Patrick is seen more recently appearing healthy and strong after taken in by a Tinton Falls veterinary facility giving him a new live . Volunteers from the Associated Humane Societies have since filed a civil suit seeking ownership of Patrick. The organization first took him to the emergency room at Garden State Veterinary Specialists. Patrick currently lives with Patricia Smillie-Scavelli, an administrator of the Tinton Falls veterinary facility where the dog was first treated. While the obviously horrific trauma the dog ensured as seen from some of the first pictures revealed inevitably left emotional and physical scarring, those who know Patrick talk only of how loving and trusting he is. Heartbreaking: Patrick was at death's door when he was taken to the emergency room at Garden State Veterinary Specialists in Tinton Fall, New Jersey and few thought he would survive . Miraculous: A year later, his carer and hospital administrator Patricia Smillie-Scavelli says he gives enormous love and sleeps in bed with her, her husband and their cat . 'He is a tremendous fighter,' said Dr . Thomas Scavelli, the director and founder of the Garden State . Veterinary Specialists, the pet hospital in Tinton Falls where Patrick . has been treated. His . wife, Patricia Smillie-Scavelli, told Irish Central: 'He really gives . love. He climbs into your lap, he would prefer to sit in your lap than . lay on the floor. He also sleeps in our bed at night, along with the . cat.' Though understandably Patrick remains nervous around strangers, reported NBC, a treat or two quickly remedies his fear. 'There are very few animals, or any life form, that could have gone through and survived what he has, and really never looked back,' said Dr Scavelli of his courageous recovery. And few who have simultaneously become so much of a celebrity. Hospital staffers have chronicled his progress on their website . and a Facebook page has garnered fans from around the world. Devoted: Patricia Smillie-Scavelli holds a 1-year-old Patrick in April last year at the hospital where she is an administrator and her husband, Dr Thomas Scavelli is director . He's received hundreds of emails, donations, gifts and letters from those inspired by his tale of survival. The hospital ordered 500 thank-you cards with Patrick's picture to mail . to those who have sent collars, dog shirts, toys, scrapbook pages or dog . blankets embroidered with Patrick's name, and they are fast running out. When Patrick was brought to the hospital after being rescued by officials at the Associated Humane Societies, he was so starved, emaciated and dehydrated he was curled into a ball, unable to walk or stand. His ribcage protruded, he weighed about 20 pounds - roughly 30 pounds less than average - and was covered in sores with parts of skin hanging off him, according to Patricia Smillie-Scavelli, Dr Scavelli's wife and the administrator of the hospital. Peace: Patrick is still nervous around strangers but a treat helps earn his trust . 'Everyone thought that, you bring in . an animal like that, that looks like it's really just a corpse, you put . it to sleep,' Mrs Smillie-Scavelli said. 'But . of course, he looked up at you with those eyes, and you say: How can . you give up on this dog? How can you, when he's not giving up on life? So, we gave him that second chance, and he has just run with it, and . thrived.' - Vets on their decision to not euthanize Patrick . After weeks of emergency measures that . included a transfusion of three pints of dog blood, a special diet, . medicine and physical therapy, Patrick began to gain weight and eat . solid food. He also started to enjoy taking outdoor walks in the sun and playing with the many toys that well-wishers had sent him. 'This . is not a month of starvation,' Dr Scavelli said soon after his rescue. 'This is a lifetime probably, or at least months and months of neglect, . and to see the way he cares for people and trusts people, that's really . been the most interesting and rewarding thing to see about the canine . spirit.' Happy holidays! While the Associated Humane Societies are fighting for custody to find Patrick a home, the Scavellis are hoping to be considered as his permanent future owners . Horrifying: When he was first brought in Patrick was starving and had been subjected to months, possibly a life time of horrific abuse . Authorities said Curtis tied the dog to a railing in her Newark apartment building and left the state for more than a week. A janitor later found the emaciated dog in a trash bin. Her mother told reporters at her daughter's court hearing that the dog had been given to Kisha but she could not take care of it, so she'd tied it up outside hoping somebody else would take it. The Essex County courthouse has also received more than 600 letters and . faxes from around the world expressing concern for the dog and urging . swift and harsh punishment for Curtis. 'In the 17 years we've been here we've never seen this type of response . to an animal,' Patricia Smillie-Scavelli said. 'There's something about . Patrick that has really sparked interest, honestly, from throughout the . entire world.' She hopes to keep and care for Patrick herself. State Superior Court . Judge Joseph Cassini III will decide who will have permanent custody of . Patrick. Cassini plans to issue his order at Curtis' Aug. 29 sentencing, . according to the prosecutor's office. The charge Curtis pleaded to carries up to 18 months in prison, but she may not serve time as a first offender. Curtis . was not accused of placing the dog in the trash chute, but prosecutors . said she was responsible for abandoning and starving the dog, resulting . in his ""torment and torture."" She was previously denied entry into a pre-trial program that could have kept her record clean.","Kisha Curtis, 29, has denied ever abusing the dog but admits to having put it outside a hallway in 2011 .

A curvaceous 22-year-old who can most often be found battering cod and deep-frying haddock behind the counter of her parents' fish and chip shop is celebrating winning a national curvy girls beauty contest. Elena Raouna, who lives in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, won Miss Britain Curve 2013, wants to use her position to let other voluptuous women know that 'you don't have to be size zero to be a model, and you can be pretty and plus size at the same time'. And the size 18 former nail technician student is now hoping to hang up her apron (just some of the time), and focus on a more glittering and less greasy career on the catwalk. Elena has worked in her family chippy, Harry's Fish Bar, for years, and has no plans to hang up her apron just yet, even though she will be spending more time focusing on her career as a plus-size model . She said: 'To go from the chippy to the catwalk is a strange way to do it, but I'm so glad that I entered and the win came as a total surprise. 'My confidence has grown over the years and hopefully I can inspire other plus- size girls to be confident in their own skin. 'I wanted to show that you don't have to be a stick thin model to take part in a beauty contest.' Elena, who was born in Doncaster and is part Cypriot, beat a string of contestants from around the country in the preliminary rounds, then triumphed in a series of catwalk shows and interviews at the final in Surrey last Saturday. Speaking about why she entered the curvy girl contest, Elana explained that she 'wanted to show that you don't have to be a stick thin model to take part in a beauty contest' She first entered an online competition to represent Miss Doncaster Curve 2013 and was then selected by panel of judges to represent the town at the national finals. 'I was browsing Facebook one night in January and saw the event, read the instructions, uploaded a photo and thought ""why not"", so I gave it a go and didn't think anything of it,' Elena said. 'The next thing I know I get a phone call saying I'd been selected and they wanted me to come for an interview - and it was a whirlwind from there.' The girls were put into small groups to practice and perform four routines, each with their own concept and costume change. Rounds included wearing colours of the British flag, wearing your own style, beach-wear and evening dress. 'I was bullied in school for being curvy but used to laugh it off, and now I am using my size to my advantage and my confidence has only grown stronger' Elena, who is a size 16 in tops and size 18 in bottoms, began working at her family's fish and chip shop, Harry's Fish Bar, around three years ago and admits she loves her food. 'My mum Christy and dad Harry's fish and chip shop has been in the family for years,' she said. 'I began university after college doing beauty therapy and studying to be a nail technician, but quit and began working in the chippy. 'I love being in the shop and can see me being there for years to come. It definitely not the most glamorous job in the world, but the regulars make it a great place to be. I get the glamour side of my life out at the modelling pageants. 'Plus-size modelling is never something I'd ever thought about but now it's something I would love to get into. I've got aspirations to model for SimplyBe or Asos. 'I think I was born with the big bum gene from Cyprus, it's definitely been passed down to me! 'My 16-year-old sister Sophia is completely the opposite. She is really petite and has loved her dancing and fitness since an early age and it's a totally different complexity.' Elena only entered the competition casually after finding an advert on Facebook in January, but says she has no plans to give up working in her parents' fish and chip shop just yet . Elena said she wants to use her win to inspire young girls who have concerns about their weight to be more confident and not to let anything stand in the way of their dreams, having  herself struggled with her weight and bullies while in school. She said: 'I really wanted to hammer home that you don't have to be so small to be a model, you can be pretty and plus size at the same time. 'If I can give girls who struggle with their weight the confidence that everyone is beautiful in their different ways, inside and out, then that is great for me. 'I put on a bikini for the first time only last year on holiday, and I have always loved food, but my motto to bullies is ""If you don't like it, don't look"", it's as simple as that! 'I was bullied in school but used to laugh it off, and now I am using my size to my advantage and my confidence has only grown stronger.' After battering the competition from all over the country, Elena revealed that she is 'proud to represent curvy women all over Britain and to prove you don't need a glamorous job to enter a pageant' As well as her crown and sash, Elena also won a DKNY handbag, jewellery, cash and a photo-shoot in Manchester in August, as well as a bouquet of red, white and blue flowers. She said: 'It is looking to be an exciting year ahead. The previous winner said I would go on to shoot for papers and magazines, and do TV appearances and events. I'm looking forward to all of that and furthering my modelling career by creating a professional portfolio. 'I am proud to represent curvy women all over Britain and to prove you don't need a glamorous job to enter a pageant.'","Elena Raouna, 22, who lives in Doncaster, won Miss Britain Curve 2013 .

A robber attacked an elderly woman after pretending to help her take pictures of her childhood home when she returned with her daughter after 73 years. Marjorie Ramondetta, 93, and her daughter Linda Reynolds, 65, were allegedly shoved down a flight of stairs in the building by a thug when they came back to the house in Washington Heights in Manhattan, New York. The man then stole the women's purses as they lay bruised at the bottom of the stairs, law-enforcement sources said. Victim: Marjorie Ramondetta, 93, was allegedly attacked by a robber in her childhood home . 'After we fell, he took the bags,' Mrs Reynolds told The New York Post yesterday. 'I heard my mother say, ""Please help me!"" 'I ran upstairs, and I’m yelling, ""Call the cops! Call . the cops! Someone help us!""' Mrs Ramondetta, who hadn’t been back to the building since 1940, said: 'We’ve never had such an upset in our life.' Mrs Reynolds said they had arrived at the building on Amsterdam Avenue and 164th Street on Tuesday at 12.20pm to snap photos for a family scrapbook. Mrs Ramondetta was having her picture taken by Mrs Reynolds when the alleged thug — identified as career criminal Richard Davidson — greeted them. 'He said, ""Can I help you?"" He was clean-cut, clean clothes, clean-shaven. He looked decent,' Mrs Reynolds recalled. Mrs Reynolds said that Davidson, 25, had asked them if they lived in the building. Mrs Ramondetta said that 'she was born there and wanted to see what it looked like at present day,' according to a police source. Davidson then escorted the women to the second-floor apartment, where Mrs Ramondetta once lived, the police source said. Attacker: CCTV shows the man later identified as Richard Davidson pushing the two women down the stairs . 'He [then] says, ""I have to get my keys downstairs,""' Mrs Reynolds said. 'He came back up and said, ""I’m going to hurt you.""' Davidson then allegedly grabbed for their purses, but the women wouldn’t let go of them. 'I tried to kick him. I don’t know if I kicked him in the legs, but my object was not the legs — if you know what I mean,' Reynolds said. Davidson then threw both women down approximately ten stairs, Mrs Reynolds said. Sources said he scooped up their purses and ran away. The women were treated at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. 'I’m in so much pain,' Mrs Reynolds said, showing the bruises on her back and buttocks. Later that day, Davidson was arrested on an unrelated grand-larceny charge. While in custody, he is said to have confessed to stealing the purses as well as to a similar case on August 2. Thief: The man is seen to tussle with the women over their bags, before making off down the stairs of the Washington Heights apartment . Police later said that Davidson had been arrested later that day trying to get into a cab, according to abc7 Eyewitness News. Police said he had a crack pipe in his pocket. He allegedly made two other attacks during the same day - on a 70-year-old woman and a 63-year-old woman who was riding the A train at Harlem. Davidson has 21 prior arrests dating back to 2008. 'I'm not used to giving up things I work for,' Mrs Ramondetta told Eyewitness News. 'I don't go out advertising it, but this is mine.' 'I want to punch him in the face and I also want his mother and his grandmother to be in the courtroom,' added Mrs Reynolds. 'I want them to see and hear what he did to us.'","Mother and daughter returned to childhood home in Washington Heights .

Could Monica's meticulous personality teamed with Chandler's neuroses be the real reason why the popular TV couple couldn't conceive? Worried about your chances of having children? The secret could be to lighten-up, say researchers. According to a new study published in the European Journal of Personality, men with neurotic personality traits are having fewer children compared to previous generations. The study examined the effect of personality on how likely a person is to have children, using extensive survey and birth registry data from Norway. It also found that men who are extroverted and open tend to have more children, while women who rank as conscientious on personality tests tend to have fewer children, regardless of which generation they are from. The study could have important implications for population dynamics at a time when fertility rates across developed countries have fallen to below replacement rates. Personality effects may be one factor contributing to the decline of fertility rates in Europe, says International Institution Applied Systems Analysis' Vegard Skirbekk, who led the study. Population changes are an important factor for projecting future changes in sustainability, climate, energy and food security. In particular, Skirbekk notes the decline in childbearing among neurotic men - neurotic meaning individuals who tend to be moody and emotional. The study found that the effect only applies for men born after 1957. Skirbekk says that the change in these men's fertility could be due to new norms in having children, for example that couples today wait longer to have children and couples tend to test each other out more before committing to raising children together. The study was made possible by Norway's very detailed birth records and an integrated personality survey, which allowed the researchers to examine the connections between both female and male fertility and personality. Extrovert men may be more fertile: Family-man and TV personality Jamie Oliver with his wife Jools and four children Poppy Honey, Daisy Boos, Petal Blossom and Buddy Bear . 'For men, often you don't know exactly how many children they have because information is not matched in the registries, but for Norway we have very exact information' says Skirbekk. While the study only considers Norway, Skirbekk says that the findings likely apply more widely. 'Norway is a leader country in terms of family dynamics,' says Skirbekk, . 'Many trends that have been observed first in Norway - increasing cohabitation, divorce rates, and later marriage, for example - have then been observed later in many other parts of the world. 'Of course it remains to be seen if this phenomenon will also spread.'","Surprising study examined link between personality and birth rates .

"By . Rachel Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 07:25 EST, 22 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:21 EST, 22 August 2013 . Scientists are developing a simpler, cheaper and more successful method of IVF. At the moment would-be parents spend thousands on the procedure that involves incubating an embryo and implanting it inside a mother's womb. But European and U.S. expert say a simplified version of the procedure, originally devised for people in developing countries, could be carried out for around £175 using generic fertility drugs and basic lab equipment that would fit inside a shoebox. Scientists are developing a new cut-price IVF technique that could reduce costs by thousands of pounds. It was initially developed for poorer countries but it could one day be introduced to wealthier nations . 'IVF is made to sound complicated but the fact is that the early embryo is not very demanding,' said Jonathan Van Blerkom, a fertility expert at the University of Colorado. A human embryo doesn't need much beyond some basic solutions, a steady pH level and constant temperature, he said. The simpler approach calls for women to take cheaper fertility tablets to stimulate their ovaries to release more than one egg per month. In conventional IVF, expensive, potent drugs that are injected can produce more than 20 eggs. Van Blerkom developed the simplified technique after European colleagues asked him how IVF could be done in developing countries. IVF currently cost thousands but the new mothod could reduce prices to as little as £175. According to Jonathon Van Blerkom, a fertility expert at the University of Colorado, it is possible to generate the exact same conditions, or very . similar, to what people are generating in a $60,000 (£39,000) incubator by using two test tubes and special . solutions. One test tube is used to prepare a solution including carbon dioxide, which creates the ideal conditions for fertilisation. The . solution is then pipetted into a second tube, where one egg and a few . thousand sperm are added, before being placed in a heating block. After about two to three days, any resulting embryo is examined under a microscope before being transferred into the woman. 'My first reaction was, ""You've got to be kidding,""' he said. But with two test tubes and special solutions, 'it's possible to generate the exact same conditions, or very similar, to what people are generating in a $60,000 (£39,000) incubator.' One test tube is used to prepare a solution including carbon dioxide, which creates the ideal conditions for fertilisation. The solution is then pipetted into a second tube, where one egg and a few thousand sperm are added, before being placed in a heating block. After about two to three days, any resulting embryo is examined under a microscope before being transferred into the woman. Van Blerkom and colleagues estimated that about half of all people seeking infertility treatment could potentially be helped by the method. Those who have complicated infertility problems, like men with severe sperm problems or women with very few eggs left, would still need standard IVF, however. In an ongoing trial in Belgium, researchers are comparing the techniques. Women under 36 seeking IVF for the first time are given a mild dose of injectable fertility drugs. If at least eight eggs are retrieved, half undergo traditional IVF, and half use the simpler method. A specialist who doesn't know which technique was used, picks the best-looking embryo to be transferred. 'You should not have to be rich just to have IVF,' said Dr Geeta Nargund (pictured), medical director for Create Health Clinics, a private fertility centre in London. 'There are so many people who cannot afford the treatment in the West that there would be huge demand if there were something cheaper available' For the more than 100 women treated so far, the pregnancy rate was about 34 percent for both methods. So far, 14 babies have been born using the simplified method and 13 babies from traditional IVF. The World Health Organization estimates there are between 120 and 160 million couples struggling with infertility worldwide. 'Nobody thinks that infertility in developing countries is a problem but it is an even bigger problem there than in (the West),' said Sheryl Vanderpoel, a WHO reproductive health expert. She said more people in poor countries have complications from untreated sexually spread infections than in the West, which can hurt their fertility. 'Making IVF affordable is a public health priority,' she added. The new treatment involves using a simple solution containing carbon dioxide and mixing it with sperm and an egg . Dr Hassan Sallam, director of the Alexandria Fertility and IVF Center in Egypt, said the cheaper IVF method would be welcomed. He said there is considerable social pressure on young Egyptian couples to have children - and that is compounded by the fact in rural areas, many newlyweds live with the man's family. 'All eyes are on the newlywed couple to see if pregnancy has happened after the first month,"" he said in an email. He said couples married for two to three months occasionally come to see him 'just to please their in-laws.' Although the new IVF strategy is intended for use mainly in developing countries, doctors in rich countries are also interested. 'You should not have to be rich just to have IVF,' said Dr. Geeta Nargund, medical director for Create Health Clinics, a private fertility center in London. 'There are so many people who cannot afford the treatment (in the West) that there would be huge demand if there were something cheaper available.' In many European countries, national health systems pay for several IVF cycles for eligible couples but it can cost more than $10,000 (£6,400) for those seeking it privately. For many couples, up to three cycles are necessary to create a baby. She has asked Britain's regulatory agency for fertility treatment for permission to test the simpler technique. Some said the success rates of the cheaper IVF method would likely be lower than those for regular IVF. The simplified method does not include any extensive screening of embryos or any procedures to inject sperm directly into the eggs. 'You aren't producing as many eggs with this (cheap) method so the numbers will not be as high,' said Ian Cooke, an emeritus professor of reproductive medicine at Sheffield University. Professor Cooke also thought training enough health professionals in developing countries might be an issue. Still, he said the method was promising. Because doctors were planning to use less potent fertility drugs, he said it was fine to cut back on the regular screening and daily tests used in normal IVF regimens. 'From a technical point of view, they have proven it works,' he said, adding it was now necessary to test the technique in developing countries. Patient groups said doctors should offer the cheaper IVF method if it is approved. 'IVF is not a one size fits all process,' said Susan Seenan, deputy chief executive of Infertility Network UK. 'Patients are being told they need all kinds of expensive procedures and this may be a good time to step back and see if that is really the case.'","Parents with fertility problems currently spend thousands to conceive .

It said: 'The club would like to offer its sincere condolences to the family of the player. 'Benitez had recently joined the club from Club America for three seasons. 'The player participated for the first time with the team during yesterday's match against Qatar Sports Club in the Sheikh Jassem Cup without complaining of any health problems. 'His sudden departure is a big shock for each member of the technical and administrative staff. 'He was a player that over the short period he was here was regarded for his high moral character.' A tweet from Club America read: 'You left as a champion, you will always be in our hearts. Rest in Peace Christian Benitez.' He was diagnosed with appendicitis, but - according to his father-in-law Cleber Chala - this developed into peritonitis and complications led to a respiratory arrest. Mr Chala, who spoke on Ecuadorian radio and cited by The Mirror, said: 'They called me at 3am to tell me that they had taken him to hospital as an emergency due to stomach pains. 'When he arrived, he was not seen to quickly. 'By the time he was admitted he was no longer responding. This happened in Qatar, my daughter is alone there.'

Football has been blighted by heart conditions hitting seemingly healthy young players. Fabrice Muamba, 25, was forced to retire from the game after collapsing on the pitch from a cardiac arrest in March last year at Tottenham’s White Hart Lane ground. The former England Under-21 midfielder was effectively dead for 78 minutes when his heart stopped beating during an FA Cup match for Bolton at Tottenham. Just a month later an Italian footballer collapsed on the pitch and died from a heart attack in front of horrified teammates and supporters. Former under 21 international Piermario Morosini, 25, who played for Livorno, was seen to tremble before falling to his knees and never regained consciousness. The heart defect that most commonly kills young athletes is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. There are a number of congenital heart defects that can hit sportsmen. The one which most commonly kills young athletes is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A genetic defect, it causes part of the heart muscle to thicken in about one in 500 people. It is most serious in the young and is exacerbated by exercise. In some countries, such as Italy, screening for this condition is mandatory for footballers and sufferers are not allowed to play. But in Britain it is up to individual clubs. Other, less common possible causes of sudden cardiac arrest include ARVD, another disorder of the heart muscle which causes part of it to turn to fat; faults with the heart’s electrical impulses; irregular rhythms; or defective heart valves. The FA has made more than 900 defibrillators available to Premier League and Football League clubs.","Ecuadorian FA say he died of heart failure after suffering 'stomach pains'

U.S. research raises the controversial prospect of a blood test providing early warning of suicide attempts. Scientists said their results were 'proof of principle' for a suicide test, while British experts reacted with scepticism. U.S. experts hope a simple blood test could help detect and treat those at a higher risk of committing suicide. However British scientist are treating the findings cautiously, saying it is one thing to find a biomarker but quite another to use it as a predictor of future behaviour . One particular molecule, an enzyme called SAT1, was linked to suicidal tendencies in a group of patients with bipolar disorder, a mental illness characterised by episodes of extreme high and low moods. Three other markers showed a weaker association.The elevated blood markers stood out in a subgroup of nine patients who displayed a sudden dramatic shift to powerful suicidal thoughts. A similar pattern was seen in blood samples taken from nine suicide victims who had succeeded in killing themselves. Finally blood samples were tested from two further groups of patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia-type pychoses. It is hoped that a test could be developed that would flag up those who will not admit they are severely depressed . Raised levels of the biomarkers correlated with admissions to hospital after suicide attempts. The link was stronger for bipolar disorder than for schizophrenia. Study leader Dr Alexander Niculescu, from Indiana University, said: 'Suicide is a big problem in psychiatry. It's a big problem in the civilian realm, it's a big problem in the military realm and there are no objective markers. 'There are people who will not reveal they are having suicidal thoughts when you ask them, who then commit it and there's nothing you can do about it. We need better ways to identify, intervene and prevent these tragic cases. 'These seem to be good markers for suicidal behaviour in males who have bipolar mood disorders or males in the general population who commit impulsive violent suicide. In the future we want to study and assemble clinical and socio-demographic risk factors, along with our blood tests, to increase our ability to predict risk.' He acknowledged one limitation of the research, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, was that the participants were all male. 'There could be gender differences,' he said. 'We would also like to conduct more extensive, normative studies in the population at large.' He plans to conduct further research focusing on more deliberate and planned suicides. In their paper, the scientists point to a link between SAT1 and polyamine, a chemical involved in apoptosis, or 'cell suicide' - the programmed self destruction of damaged or harmful cells. British scientists said the research should be treated with caution. Professor Matthew Hotopf, from the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London, stressed the need to have the results replicated by other studies. He added: 'It's one thing to find a biomarker which might be associated at a statistical level with suicidal behaviour. It's quite another to use it to make any kind of prediction which has clinical utility. 'These findings may attract media attention, but they are very much preliminary and my money would be on failed replication and even if replication was successful, lack of predictive power to be a useful clinical tool.'","U.S. experts found that an enzyme, called SAT1, was linked to suicidal tendencies in a group of people with bipolar disorder .

A man, who has lived his entire life with a heart protruding from his abdomen, is finally able to walk upright without getting out of breath or turning blue. Huang Rongming, from Henan province in China, underwent life-changing surgery to correct heart a defect and move the organ away from his abdomen and into his ribcage. He had lived with the rare condition for 24 years until a doctor told him his condition was rapidly deteriorating and that he required urgent surgery. Huang Rongming, from Henan province in China, was born with congenital heart displacement. It only occurs in between five and eight people out of one million. Most patients die soon after birth . Congenital heart displacement is incredibly rare and occurs in just five babies out of every million born. Most patients die soon after birth. Mr Rongming could not afford the procedure, that would place his heart in his chest, as it should be, but media coverage of his condition enabled him to undergo to life-changing operation. 'It's a dream come true. I'm going to lead a normal life like everyone else,' he told ChinaDaily. Before surgery, Mr Rongming's heart could clearly be seen pumping underneath a thin layer of skin and bulging out from his upper belly. The condition often left the factory worker blue and breathless so he spent much of his 24 years lying down to make sure blood flowed around his body . Mr Rongming's parents admitted they were anxious when he was a little boy and said that he was not allowed to play with other children for fear that he would have an accident and die. As farmers they could not afford for him to have surgery . When Mr Rongming was born, doctors did not think he would survive, as his protruding heart had defects and was vulnerable to injury. Mr Rongming has now undergone life-changing surgery and his heart is in his chest . His parents admitted they were anxious when he was a boy and said that he was not allowed to play with other children for fear that he would die. The condition made the young Mr Rongming vulnerable to breathlessness and turning blue if he stood up as well as sudden death if his heart was knocked. As farmers they could not afford for him to have surgery, however. Earlier this year he sought treatment at Wuhan Union Hospital. His doctor, Dong Nianguo, a cardiac surgeon at the hospital, was astonished that he was still alive. Tests showed Huang's condition was deteriorating rapidly, and he needed immediate surgery, which could cost about 200,000 yuan. Huang's story attracted considerable media coverage and within six days of his story being reported, he received all the money he needed from kind readers. The surgery lasted more than 10 hours and was entirely successful. His abdomen is now flat and his heart defect fixed.

Pancreatic cells (pictured) secrete glucagon and other hormones . Obese people never feel full after eating due to a 'misfiring' hormone, according to a new study. Researchers found glucagon, a hormone involved in regulating appetite, loses its ability to help obese people feel full after a meal, but it continues to suppress hunger pangs in people with type 1 diabetes. The primary role of glucagon, which is secreted by the pancreas, is to signal the body to release stored glucose when blood sugar falls too low. But growing evidence suggests the hormone may also play a role in controlling food intake and feelings of fullness, or satiation, through signalling the body to reduce levels of other appetite hormones such as ghrelin. The study's lead author, Dr Ayman Arafat of Chariti-University Medicine in Germany, said: 'Once a person becomes obese, glucagon no longer induces feelings of fullness. 'Further research is needed to determine why glucagon no longer suppresses appetite effectively in this population, even though they are otherwise healthy.' The study, published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, investigated glucagon levels and appetite among 11 obese people, 13 of whom had type 1 diabetes and 13 lean people who received injections of either glucagon or a placebo. The researchers then measured their appetites using a satiety scale as well as levels of the appetite hormone ghrelin. Feelings of fullness did not differ between obese study participants who received glucagon injections and those who were given the placebo. Growing evidence suggests glucagon may also play a role in controlling food intake and feelings of fullness, or satiation, through signalling the body to reduce levels of other appetite hormones such as ghrelin . In comparison, participants who were lean or had type 1 diabetes reported feeling significantly more full after receiving glucagon. The response to the hormone was detectable in this population, even 24 hours after it was administered. Dr Arafat said: 'The findings could influence efforts to develop new treatments for obesity and diabetes. 'Although therapeutic agents that influence glucagon and other hormones currently are considered a promising avenue for research, this study suggests a treatment involving glucagon may be ineffective in controlling meal size in people who are obese.' Glucagon is a hormone that is produced by cells in a part of the pancreas known as the islets of Langerhans. The hormone plays an active role in allowing the body to regulate the utilisation of glucose and fats. Glucagon is released in response to low blood glucose levels and when the body needs additional glucose, such as after vigorous exercise. When glucagon is released it stimulates the liver to break down glycogen to be released into the blood as glucose, activates gluconeogenesis, (the conversion of amino acids into glucose) and breaks down stored fat into fatty acids for use as fuel by cells. Glucagon serves to keep blood glucose levels high enough for the body to function well. When blood glucose levels are low, glucagon is released and signals the liver to release glucose into the blood. The hormone is secreted in response to meals varies and the amount varies depending on the food eaten. In response to a carbohydrate-heavy meal, glucagon levels in the blood fall to stop blood glucose levels soaring. However, is a person eats a meal rich in protein, glucagon levels in the blood increase. In people with diabetes, the presence of glucagon can push blood glucose levels too high because wither not enough insulin is present or in the case of type 2 diabetes, the body is not very good at responding to insulin.","German researchers found glucagon, a hormone involved in regulating appetite, loses its ability to help obese people feel full after a meal .

We now only sleep for six hours and 41 minutes each night and half of us have no chance of a weekend lie-in, a new study reveals. A busy 48 per cent of us can't afford to waste precious time cramming in a well-deserved snooze when we're not working at the weekend. And it seems even during the week we are struggling to get enough shut eye. Worryingly, two-thirds (65 per cent) of us are only sleeping for six hours and 27 minutes, the study of 2,000 UK adults found. The figure is one hour and 33 minutes short of the recommended daily amount of sleep - eight hours. The new research, carried out by Travelodge, highlights that more than a quarter (27 per cent) are getting less sleep than they did a year ago. Most people in the UK sleep for just six hours and 27 minutes, and a quarter of us are getting steadily worse at shutting our eyes: 27 per cent of adults sleep less than they did a year ago . Instead of a weekend lie-in, British people are opting for 11 minutes of extra 'snooze button' time, which sleep experts believe could be detrimental to health. Four out of ten adults polled by Travelodge admit they set their wake-up call earlier than required, then hit the snooze button on their mobile phones twice for an additional 11 minutes' rest, in order to trick their bodies into thinking they are having more shut-eye. One of the key reasons we are becoming a nation of snooze button addicts is due to the fact that 68 per cent of Britons now use their mobile phone to wake them up every morning. Stevie Williams at the Edinburgh Sleep Centre, said: 'Setting your alarm clock much earlier than you intend to get up and continually pressing snooze actually makes you feel more groggy than refreshed after a night's sleep. 'Snoozing in this way can lead you to miss out on the vital REM sleep that occurs just before you wake up. 'It is more beneficial to your health to use the weekend to catch up on any sleep debt you have accumulated during the week.' Are you a weekend lie-inner or a weekend snooze buttoner? The latter could be detrimental to your health . Other key findings revealed that Coventrians, Brightonians and Belfastians are the worst sleep deprived individuals across the country - each of them are clocking even less sleep than the national average sleep figure of six hours and 27 minutes. 1.    Money worries (32%) 2.    Family issues (25%) 3.    Work stress (18%) 4.    Job security worries (17%) 5.    Unfinished household chores (16%) Conversely, people in Aberystwyth, Plymouth and Aberdeen are the country's best sleepers, each notching up more than six and a half hours. The . sleep study also delved into the key reasons to why Britons are not . getting their recommended sleep quota of eight hours per night. A third of adults are . kept awake at night due to money worries, a quarter toss and turn over family issues, and just under one-fifth fret about work stresses. Shakila . Ahmed, spokesman for Travelodge, said: 'Although we are coming out of the . recession, Britons are still worried about money and work issues, which . is fuelling this sleep disorder. 'Not only is over a quarter of the . nation getting less sleep now, than they did a year ago but nearly half . of the adult population is too busy for a weekend lie-in so that they . can catch up on lost sleep.

An authority on animals is calling for a cat curfew so as to protect millions of hedgehogs, birds and other wildlife. Rosie Catford wants owners to ensure their cats stay indoors at night, and says such a curfew already operates in parts of Australia. Rosie from Wildlives Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre in Thorrington, Essex, said more than 200million birds alone are killed by domestic cats every year in the UK. She said small mammals including baby hedgehogs are also targets. 'They have a cat curfew in Australia as they have wiped out a lot of the native wildlife,' she said. 'I would like to see something like that in this country. 'It's not just birds they kill - the first baby hedgehogs we had come in this year were orphaned when the mother was killed by a cat. 'In Australia they have cat patrols going . around with wagons and nets - any cats seen out at night after the . curfew are caught and inpounded and the owners have to pay a fine.' The hedgehog population is in massive decline, and has plunged from 33million 20 years ago to less than a million now .

'We have had a massive explosion of animals coming in as the extremes of the weather has made it very difficult for the parents of the baby birds and hedgehogs to get enough food,' she said. 'It went from very cold to very dry and hot. The hedgehog population is in massive decline, we have gone from 33million 20 years ago to less than a million now.

"By . Eric Clark . PUBLISHED: . 04:15 EST, 20 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:27 EST, 20 August 2013 . Seven months after nearly  losing my leg during an emergency operation, I sent my medical notes to a hospital 3,700 miles away. The FedEx box bulged with 26 pages of letters; 54 sheets detailing ultrasounds, X-rays, pathology results and blood transfusion reports; ECG readings of the electrical activity of my heart; five CD-roms of CT scans; specifics about my operations; hospital discharge notes and so on. I was taking advantage of a little-known but increasingly popular opportunity to get second opinions from some of America's (and, therefore, the world's) best hospitals and doctors. Not that I don't trust doctors here, but I faced a devil's dilemma: what to do after a spectacularly failed operation? My problems had begun months earlier, when a fierce pain in my calf made walking difficult. An ultrasound at the Royal London Hospital revealed an aneurysm - a ballooning portion of artery - behind my right knee. The cost varies with the condition, and ranges from Cleveland's £365 to Harvard Hospital's £710 . The cause of aneurysms is unknown, although they are more common in older men and may be linked to clogged arteries and, in the case of knees, stresses on the arteries when the leg bends and straightens. I was told if my aneurysm was left untreated, blood could clot in it, shutting down blood flow - and some clots might travel down to the foot. Either scenario could lead to amputation of the lower leg. The solution was to remove that portion of the artery, bridging the gap with a graft. My operation last December seemed to be a success. Out of hospital in a week, I was soon walking. But less than a month later, I was readmitted with a deep wound infection and needed further operations. The first, to clean out the wound, failed to defeat the infection. The second removed the graft, leaving an 8cm gap. The gamble was that, over time, more blood would flow through the smaller blood vessels to keep the leg supplied. There followed a third emergency operation at 5am one day to deal with heavy bleeding. I had to be given ten units of blood - about the amount the body contains - and doctors began discussing the chances of me losing my leg or my life. But after more antibiotics, I kept both, and was discharged five weeks later. Some infection remained and I continued to take antibiotics, but nothing more could be done in hospital. The hope was that my body would naturally keep the infection under control. 'All the prestige hospitals are involved,' says Jonathan Linkous, of the American Telemedicine Association . Walking was more difficult and painful than before the operations, unsurprisingly seeing as how there was little real blood flow to the lower leg. My foot was effectively dead - white and cold - but it still managed to be immensely, relentlessly painful. Drugs and exercise meant it got just enough blood - and, therefore, oxygen - to be what the surgeon euphemistically called 'viable'. The dilemma? Whether to live on permanent heavy painkillers and cope with a limited lifestyle, or repeat the operation to fit a graft, which had nearly cost me my life. My specialist said only I could decide. That's when I discovered online second opinions. The service began in America in the late Nineties and has grown quickly. 'All the big, prestige hospitals in America are involved,' says Jonathan Linkous, chief executive officer of the American Telemedicine Association. Dr Joseph C. Kvedar, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, started organising second opinions four years ago. That first year there were 100 to 150 cases; today there are about 1,000, with half outside of the United States. Hospitals list an array of conditions on which they can offer a second opinion. Dr Kvedar says he can call on about 4,500 specialists, adding: 'We can pretty well guarantee a world expert in your condition no matter how rare.' And the other hospitals make similar promises. I decided to seek a second opinion from the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, which has repeatedly come out top in this medical area (as ranked by the U.S. News and World Report survey, which analyses 5,000  American hospitals). After registering online, I was asked for credit card details. The fee is not charged until the second opinion is sent, and you can pull out without charge before this. The cost varies with the condition, and ranges from Cleveland's $565 (about £365), the amount I paid, to Harvard Hospital's $1,100 (about £710). There can also be extras, such as paying for test results to be reviewed. And then the work begins. First, I had to complete a 56-page questionnaire. The hospital also requires a lot of additional information (hence the bulging FedEx box). Your condition determines what this demands, but collecting it involves time, energy and persistence. Gathering data from two hospitals and a surgeon in the UK took me more than two months.The drawback is that the consultant does not examine the patient. However, the hospitals offering the service say doctors have evolved techniques to compensate. Alex Nason, of John Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, says: 'In the past, you had a physician who would hold a film up to a light. Now they are looking at their monitors and making decisions there.' But UK experts have doubts. Dr Linda Patterson, clinical vice-president of the Royal College of Physicians, explains: 'An online consultation with someone you've never met seems difficult. The difference between the American system and us is that we use GPs to make referrals to specialists. Patients don't refer themselves.' Many patients are rewarded only with peace of mind when specialists endorse their original diagnosis . (Though for some patients - including this one - this difference is a positive, making the U.S. system seem less protectionist and puts the patient in charge.) Although many patients are rewarded only with peace of mind when specialists endorse their original diagnosis and treatment (itself an important return), treatment can change radically for some. Testimonials on the Cleveland website include one from Dr Lucy Sauer from Florida, whose daughter was told she had a rare heart deformity necessitating surgery. Cleveland's doctors examined tests and MRI images and concluded there was no deformity. In another case, Susan Walaska, from Iowa, was told a mitrial valve prolapse (when the flaps in one of the heart's valves don't close tightly) required an operation. Her second opinion suggested she didn't need surgery, at least for now. As well as the standard fee, I paid £90 for courier delivery of my data. So, was it worth it? My answer is a resounding yes. My four-page conclusions arrived three months after my first parcel was sent, from Dr Mehdi H. Shishehbor, a specialist in interventional cardiology and endovascular interventions. Dr Shishehbor was born in Iran and is a poetry lover, I was told. His CV is filled with qualifications, awards and published papers. Sweetcorn for eye health. It's a good source of lutein, an antioxidant needed for the macula, . the part of the eye that allows us to see fine detail. Eating . lutein-rich foods has been shown to reduce the risk of age-related . macular degeneration. I had half hoped for a miracle cure. This was not to be. Nevertheless, I thought his report brilliant, summing up my problems and the pros and cons of the different steps I could take. My impressed GP said it contained information about my condition that she had not known from my UK notes.The advice read: 'It appears that you have exhausted all options.' Except for more surgery. 'Because of what you have gone through and the residual infection that may still be present in your leg, the risk would be high,' it stated. Apart from a suggested drug change, I was doing everything right. In the UK, one drug - naftidrofuryl - is prescribed on the NHS to increase the amount of oxygen carried in blood. He preferred another called Cilostazol (more than three times the price). My surgeon offered it on private prescription, but advised against it because of side-effects. Dr Shishehbor said I should only have surgery if I could no longer accept the physical limitations caused by the leg, or if the leg came into danger. Any operation, his report said - giving detailed reasons - would carry a risk of amputation. So when my surgeon asked what I'd decided, I said I would accept any lifestyle changes to avoid surgery, including taking permanent heavy painkillers and adjusting my life. Although I'm past retirement age, I am a full-time journalist and author. Before the operation, I was in helicopters with trauma doctors and had been operating undercover in China investigating sweat shops. That level of activity would have to end. I would also have to limit the energy I could put into being taught ballet by my four-year-old granddaughter. 'I didn't want to press you either way,' said my surgeon, after a long silence. 'But that's what I hoped you'd decide.'","Eric Clark sent a bulging FedEx box of medical notes to doctors in America .

A toddler had to have part of his body built from scratch when he was born, due to a rare condition. George Dibb, now 16-months-old, had an entire part of his digestive system missing so just hours into his life he underwent major surgery, which saw doctors build him a replica duodenum. The condition, which affects 1 in 50,000 births in the UK, occurs when there is a build up of amniotic fluid in the womb, causing an absence of the vital organ and a ‘double-bubble’ becomes visible on diagnostic x-rays of the abdomen. Happy families: George, now 16-months old with proud parents Emma and David. The rare condition affects 1 in 50,000 births in the UK . His mother Emma Grainger had to have eight litres of fluid drained from her baby bump before she could give birth to him - enough to fill four large coca-cola bottles. Emma, 27, said: 'I first knew there was something wrong because of the size of my bump, which appeared really quickly. 'George was my first baby but I’d seen other pregnant women, including my sister, and I was much bigger. 'I am naturally tall and skinny, but it looked like I had a basketball shoved up my top.' While doctors were not initially concerned, they soon became bothered 32-weeks into Emma’s pregnancy, when they noticed she had an excessive amount of amniotic fluid in her womb. An ultrasound confirmed that her baby had ‘double bubble’ which occurred as George’s stomach was not attached to his bowel. The increase in fluid meant he could not swallow all of the fluid while in the womb and absorbed it into his digestive tract. Doctors whisked baby George into life-saving surgery hours after birth. Without the operation, he would have slowly starved to death . When Emma and her fiance David, from Doncaster, South Yorks, were told of their unborn baby’s condition, they were given the option, almost seven months into the pregnancy, to abort it. Emma said: 'I was speechless and in complete shock. Until now, everything had seemed completely normal. 'But there was no way we were going to get rid of him. We were so excited to meet him and we wouldn’t have given him up for anything.' The only way doctors could allow George to be born was to drain the excess fluid from her stomach, using a huge needle, which was inserted into her stomach. Eight litres was siphoned from Emma’s stomach before medics confirmed it was safe for George to be born at 38 weeks - just a fortnight before his due date. After a caesarean section at Northern General Hospital, Sheffield, George was born last April, and immediately whisked away to the nearby Children’s Hospital for constructive surgery on his abdomen. He required a duodenum, the first section of the small intestine, which is crucial for digestion. Without the operation, he would have . been unable to digest any food and if the condition had not been . discovered, he would have slowly starved to death. David, 27, a buyer for a pharmaceutical company, said: 'They basically open him up and start plumbing. 'They built a pipe and fed it into his digestive system to sit between his small intestine and his bowel. The condition - which is caused by a build-up of amniotic fluid - can be detected by a diagnostic x-ray. Eight litres of fluid were drained from Emma's womb before it was safe to deliver George at 38 weeks . For new-mum Emma, she didn’t see her son for days, and was simply given a number of photos and a breast pump while George underwent life-saving surgery.' 'It was devastating not being able to . see him,' she said. 'I’d undergone surgery myself having a caesarean so I . couldn’t get out of bed and go and see him.' 'When I did see him, he had all these tubes coming out of him. As a first-time mum, it was very scary. I was devastated.' After a fortnight, Emma and David were able to bring George home for the first time and the youngster is now a happy and healthy little boy. Emma added: 'We were at the hospital everyday with him for two weeks. To see each tube come out and notice a bit more development was amazing. 'The doctors were impressed that I still wanted to breast feed. I watched the milk go through his tubes and I think it helped him to get better. 'He’s our happy, smiling, bouncing baby boy now, and we’re so proud of everything he’s been through in his short life.'","George Dibbs was born with an entire part of his digestive tract missing .

The number of men opting for beard transplants has rocketed in the past year, according to new research. Figures have revealed that the amount of men having the procedure - which usually involves patching up areas rather than transplanting an entire beard - has risen by 13 per cent in just 12 months. The facial hair transplant is now three times as popular as the rhinoplasty or nose-job among men. This shows how a facial hair transplant can help fill in sparse patches of hair, such as in the sideburns. Most men opt for patch transplants rather than entire beard transplants, according to surgeons . It is thought that the celebrity trend for facial hair is driving the boom, with famous faces such as Gary Barlow and Brad Pitt proving to be influential. Recently Newsnight's Jeremy Paxman caused a Twitter storm after he was seen to be sporting a full bush of beard growth after returning from holiday. One patient to have had the novel surgery is a 48-year-old farmer, who chose to have a hair transplant to fill in his meagre sideburns. Gary Barlow 24 per cent . David Beckham 20 per cent . George Clooney 13 per cent . Brad Pitt 11 per cent . Jeremy Paxman 10 per cent . Tom Selleck 8 per cent . Ewan McGregor 6 per cent . Ashton Kutcher 4 per cent . Zach Galifianakis 3 per cent . Richard Branson 1 per cent . He said he had 'always felt his masculinity had been undermined by not being able to grow proper ""mutton chops"".' His operation was carried out by the Crown Clinic's surgeon Asim Shahmalak, . who has also performed hair transplants on a number of celebrities. During the operation hair was harvested from the back of his head via follicular unit . extraction (FUE), where individual hairs are taken and implanted into the area being treated. The procedure usually takes around three hours. During the unnamed patient's procedure specifically, Mr Shahmalak transplanted 200 grafts - there are between one and three hairs in each graft - into each of the patient's sideburns. Mr Shahmalak claimed he had witnessed a 25 per cent rise in the number of procedures over . the last three years as beards have become more fashionable. Celebrities including Gary Barlow (left) and Brad Pitt (right) are . thought to have fuelled the boom in facial hair transplants. The . procedure is now three times more popular than the male rhinoplasty or . nose-job . He said: 'A proper, full-grown beard has been the ultimate definition of masculinity for centuries. 'But many . men struggle to grow beards, sideburns and moustaches. 'They have . significant gaps in their facial hair and the end result can look patchy . and unconvincing. He added that patchy facial hair was often a genetic problem. He said: 'If the father had trouble growing a beard then there is a good chance the son will also have patchy facial hair. Dr Shahmalak has carried out two hair transplants on Embarrassing Bodies star Christian Jessen. Dr Jessen turned to him after being taunted on Twitter about his thinning hair. And Mr Shahmalak isn't the only person to wiotness a shrp rise in business. Having . pioneered the world’s first facial hair transplant in 1996, Dr Bessam . Farjo, founder of The Farjo Hair Institute, claims he has seen a . six-fold year on year increase in the amount of men having surgery to . boost their facial follicles over the last five years. Trendsetter? Jeremy Paxman caused a media storm when he appeared on Newsnight with a hairy accessory on his face . He said: 'A full beard is very much a statement look, and it goes in and out of fashion. For the last 12 to 18 months, there has been a noticeable rise in the number of men coming to my practice wanting to fill in bald patches or thicken wisps of hair.' According to the International Society of hair Restoration, more than 4,500 procedures were carried out in the UK last year, 13 per cent more than those performed the previous year. This is over 300 per cent more than the 1,043 rhinoplasties undergone by men in the UK during the same year. But while having a full face of bristles may boost a man's self esteem, the effect appears to be lost on many women. A . recent survey of how beards are perceived by the opposite sex found that two-thirds of women preferred the clean-shaven look to a . beard. However, no hair isn't necessarily better -  the poll revealed that 48 per cent of women found stubble sexier than a bare face.","It is thought hirsute celebrities including Gary Barlow, Brad Pitt and even Jeremy Paxman are driving the trend for hairier faces .

The hot weather has been blamed for a host of travel problems - from tarmac melting, to train tracks buckling. But now it would appear that Britain's heatwave has caused planes to become 'too heavy' to take off. Safety concerns about the plane taking off has led to passengers being blocked from boarding their plane, and in some cases passengers are being forced to disembark to lighten the load. London City Airport is allegedly suffering more than others because it has a smaller runway, and in hot weather planes need more time to take off . Passengers were removed from a Swiss flight between London City Airport and Geneva on Sunday, the Daily Telegraph reported. The airport is allegedly suffering more than others because it has a smaller runway, and in the hot weather planes need a longer amount of time to take off. Because warm air is less dense than cold air, subsequently there are fewer air molecules in a given volume of warm air than in the same volume of cooler air. As temperature and humidity rises, the air becomes less dense, and therefore the air creates less lift for the airplane. As temperature and humidity rises, the air becomes less dense, and therefore the air creates less lift for the airplane . 'As a result, on a hot day, an airplane will require more runway to take off, will have a poor rate of climb and a faster approach and will experience a longer landing roll,' Pilot Friend explained. On Sunday, 15 passengers were asked to disembark a Swiss Airlines flight out of London City Airport because the plane was too heavy to take off, Opodo reported. 'Due to weather conditions, the take-off weight of the aircraft had to be reduced due to safety reasons,' a spokesman for Swiss told the Telegraph. 'In very high temperatures it usually takes longer until the aircraft can actually take-off, and since London City Airport has a short airstrip the take-off weight needed to be reduced,' they said. However, a spokesman for the airport said that the heat had not caused any airplanes to be grounded, and suggested that the plane was overweight. A spokesman for City Airport said: 'City Airport is a STOLport (short take off and landing) but very little stops the planes that are certified to fly in and out of here doing so - and hot weather isn't one of those factors. 'Sounds like the plane was overweight, pure and simple - something that happens to all planes at all airports regardless of runway size.' Larger airports, like Gatwick and Heathrow, have far longer runways, giving the planes the time and length they need to safely take off. The hot weather which has grounded planes shows no sign of abating. This month has been the hottest and driest July on record since 2006, forecasters have confirmed.And while the prolonged hot spell will continue to peter out as temperatures slump to normal levels, the UK can look forward to one more scorcher with the mercury set to soar to 32C. Temperatures could even top that level in the south - making it the hottest August day in a decade.","London City Airport is allegedly suffering more than others because it has a smaller runway, and in hot weather planes need more time to take off ."

A woman who fled an attempted rape on a Canadian rural road was lost for 12 days when she ran deep into the wilderness and could not find her way back, it was revealed Tuesday. The 25-year-old woman - a member of the O'Chiese Indiana band - survived by eating berries and river water while she wandered the backcountry with a broken jaw and concussion she suffered in the assault, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. Authorities have arrested Kevin Roy Gladue, 36, in connection with the attack and charged him with sexual assault, aggravated assault and obstructing a peace officer. The woman is a member of the O'Chiese Indian band and was lost on the 54-square-mile reservation . The woman, who was barely conscious when she was found by an oil rig worker, managed to tell police that she was with Gladue and several friends on the north end of the O’Chiese Indian band in rural Alberta, Canada on July 14, according to the Canadian Press. When the truck broke down in the middle of the wilderness, she and Gladue got out and began to walk to get help. She says Gladue then struck her in the face and tried to sexually assault her. She fought him off and then rant into the wilderness of the vast 54 square mile O'Chiese reservation. 'She fled into the bush and, when she was in there, she got lost and disoriented and couldn’t find her way out again,' RCMP Corporal Nick Munro said. For 12 days she wandered through the woods, trying to find her way back to civilization. Middle of nowhere: The O'Chiese reservation where the woman was lost is 140miles from Edmonton in Alberta, Canada . Four days after she went missing, her mother called authorities. The RCMP and members of the O'Chiese nation mounted a massive search but could find no evidence of where she went on the vast reservation. Authorities did not know about the attack at the time. They interviewed Gladue, who said he had no idea where she was. The RCMP never suspected him of foul play at the time. To survive, the woman drank fresh river water and foraged for berries. She was discovered Friday when she stumbled on an oil rig worker who happened to be near the reservation. She was about six miles from the spot where she fled from the road. She was barely conscious at the time. She had a broken jaw and numerous infected cuts on her body. 'She was suffering from exposure, may have been mildly concussed from the altercation - not in great shape,' the RCMP spokesman said.","The 25-year-old was in a remote part of Alberta, Canada, on the 54-square-mile O'Chiese Indian reservation .

A Silicon Valley real estate magnate has been accused of putting a spiked dog collar and leash on his pregnant wife before chaining her to the bed at gunpoint for two days and raping her with a golf putter. Details of the alleged horrific incident emerged in court this week during 74-year-old Clyde Berg's preliminary hearing on charges of corporal injury of a spouse and sexual penetration by force. His Swedish wife Ellena Berg, 37, was found bloodied and bound in the couple's San Jose home last year when she was nine-months pregnant and told police her elderly husband outfitted her with the leash and chained her to the bed while sexually assaulting her with the golf club. Berg is not the father of her child. Wife: Ellena Berg, 37, was found bloodied and bound in her San Jose home last year when she was nine-months pregnant and told police her elderly husband chained her to the bed . She took the stand yesterday at Santa Clara County Hall of Justice to present her version of events to a judge who must now decide if there is enough evidence to hold Berg over for trial. The real estate magnate - who is worth $200 million - vehemently denies the charges and claims he's the victim of a scam to get around a restrictive prenuptial agreement. He faces 15 years to life in prison. During her testimony yesterday, Ellena shocked the court by refusing to answer to key questions - one about a night in 2010 when she was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and how her two previous pregnancies ended. The San Jose Mercury News reported that when the 37-year-old said, 'I refuse to answer that', in response to one of the questions, the judge's eyes widened. The Swedish native has claimed in a 43-page civil suit that the incident capped off ten years of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her husband. The divorce papers state that Clyde Berg wielded his considerable power against her like 'a weapon of mass destruction' and claim she lived in virtual isolation 'as a slave' in fear of his unpredictable physical and sexual abuse. She said he made her drink out of a dog's water bowl and dunked her head in the toilet after she vomited from morning sickness. There have already been doubts raised about her account of what happened on the night of September 4 after gynecological reports that arguably show Ellena Berg did not sustain the degree of sexual abuse she claims and questions were raised as to how she was able to call 911 while her hands were cuffed behind her back. Clyde Berg is the brother and business partner of billionaire Carl Berg, one of the richest people in the United States. Ellena Berg has also obtained a restraining order against Clyde Berg and has custody of Rudy, the couple's beloved Weimaraner, whom she claimed was also abused by her estranged husband. She is his third wife.","Clyde Berg is worth $200million .

He was only trying his best to halt a spate of car crashes outside his business, but ended up in court. John Nelson, 57, landlord of the Coach and Horses pub in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, simply moved an arrow pointing to two nearby car parks and for weeks afterwards there were no more incidents. But then council officials moved the sign back and within days there was another collision on the road. Again he moved the sign with the same success, but again the council undid his good work. Problem recognised: Pub landlord John Nelson, 57, of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, moved an arrow pointing to two nearby car parks and for weeks afterwards there were no more incidents . Finally the council installed a camera to see who was changing the sign on the road and caught Mr Nelson. The next thing he knew, the police arrived and charged him with causing £400 of damage. Mr Nelson has fought a running battle with council officials because the two-lane, one-way road running into the town past his pub has been a scene many crashes and near misses since 2009. He said the problem is that a sign pointing right to two car parks, one a multi-storey, confuses drivers who try to switch from one lane to the other while driving along West Park to make the turning. Several have collided with other vehicles and there have been various near misses, Mr Nelson said. ‘On one occasion I was on the phone to the council when I heard a terrific screeching and when I looked outside, two cars had collided,’ he said. ‘This problem has been going on for several years.’ ‘But no-one will do anything about it. What does it need - someone to be badly injured, or killed? It must have cost insurance companies tens of thousands of pounds to pay for repairs to vehicles damaged in these collisions.’ Paint job: Mr Nelson has fought a running battle with council officials because the two-lane, one-way road running into the town past his pub has been a scene many crashes and near misses since 2009 . He decided to take matters into his own hands and use a stepladder and paint scraper to climb up to the offending arrow and point it away from the car park, simply directing motorists to go straight on. 'No-one will do anything about it. What does it need - someone to be badly injured, or killed? It must have cost insurance companies tens of thousands of pounds to pay for repairs to vehicles damaged in these collisions' John Nelson, pub landlord . Mr Nelson said: ‘It worked and for six weeks there wasn't one collision or near miss. Then the council sent workmen to turn the arrow around again and with two days there had been another collision. The sign confuses motorists and they just cross from one side of the road to other. That's when problems start.’ After Mr Nelson moved the sign again the council eventually put up a camera on a lamp post to catch the culprit. ‘I knew it was there but that wasn't going to stop me,’ he said. After being caught on film Mr Nelson was charged with causing criminal damage to the sign. Ironically the camera, which could have been used to monitor the traffic, has been removed. When he appeared at Harrogate Magistrates' Court to face the criminal damage charge, Mr Nelson was told that the case against him would be adjourned for two weeks. Sorting it out: He decided to take matters into his own hands and use a stepladder and paint scraper to climb up to the offending arrow and point it away from the car park, simply directing motorists to go straight on . It was so police could reconsider the allegation and possibly agree to issuing him with a caution. Geoffrey Rogers, defending, said: ‘Problems with this sign have caused innumerable accidents. Mr Nelson has complained to the council and has met them and police but nothing has been done. ‘He moved the position of an arrow so that people who do not know Harrogate would drive straight on, rather than risking an accident by turning right. For six weeks there were no accidents. 'Our view is that there is no evidence of any potential threat to road safety, providing motorists exercise the due care and attention which the law and traffic regulation require' North Yorkshire Highways spokesman . 'Then the council turned the sign back again and within days there were more accidents. Mr Nelson moved the sign again and once again there were no accidents until the council turned the sign round again. He accepts that he has caused some minor damage to the sign.’ Within minutes of the hearing ending, Mr Nelson was standing by the junction when two cars almost collided. ‘It is typical,’ he said. ‘I am hauled to court because I try to help prevent accidents and the council put up a camera but then take it down when they have caught me, instead of leaving it there to monitor the junction.’ A North Yorkshire Highways spokesman said today: ‘The issue of this sign has been the subject of discussions both internally and with North Yorkshire Police. ‘Our view is that there is no evidence of any potential threat to road safety, providing motorists exercise the due care and attention which the law and traffic regulation require.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","John Nelson, 57, moved sign outside Coach and Horses pub in Harrogate .

Anyone who clapped eyes on two-year-old Chris Pickbourne in his blue overalls and hard hat in 1988 probably had a pretty shrewd guess at his future job plans. And, sure enough, the toddler who was the face of a Nissan recruitment campaign 25 years ago is now one of the Sunderland car maker’s maintenance men. Mr Pickbourne owes his mother for pointing the way after she put him forward for the 1988 photo-shoot. Chris Pickbourne, 28, was billed as 'Britain's most successful two-year-old' when he was used to promote Nissan's graduate scheme . Wendy Pickbourne said: ‘When I took . Chris to the shoot there were a few volunteers, but he was the only one . who would sit still for the photographer.’ Mr . Pickbourne, who lives in nearby Washington, said: ‘The factory was . under construction when I was born and it is amazing to think how the . company has grown during my lifetime.’ He recently joined Nissan as a member of the maintenance team at the company's Sunderland plant - and bosses are using him to promote the latest wave of jobs at the factory. The plant in the North-East is the UK's largest car factory with more than 500,000 models rolling off the production line last year. It's a far cry from when Mr Pickbourne first represented Nissan in 1988, when just 28,797 cars - all Bluebird saloon - left the factory. Staff numbers have now rocketed from 1,100 to more than 6,000 as the firm manufactures four different models. Dressed in blue overalls and with a hard hat perched on his head, the young Mr Pickbourne appeared in the adverts while waving the Union flag . Mr Pickbourne, from Washington, said: 'The factory was under construction when I was born and it is amazing to think how the company has grown during my lifetime.
