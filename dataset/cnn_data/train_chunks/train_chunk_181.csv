"(CNN) -- Let's understand what all the fuss is about with the Obama administration's ill-conceived ""Fast and Furious"" operation -- or rather what it should be about. It's not about assigning blame, or playing ""gotcha,"" or covering up mistakes. It's not about Republican critics forcing top administration officials to resign, or those officials spinning whatever fantastic narratives are necessary to avoid doing so. It's about who pays the price when government agencies make bad decisions. When field agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives deliberately allowed some 2,000 guns to ""walk"" into Mexico from gun shops in Arizona as part of a harebrained and hazardous scheme to track Mexican drug cartels, and then lost track of the cargo, they set in motion a deadly series of events. Before long, guns from the operation were showing up at crime scenes on both sides of the border. When one government agency screws up, other agencies sometimes pay the price. One of the weapons even showed up at the murder scene of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. But by far, the group that paid the heaviest price for this doomed initiative is the Mexican people. There is no way to know how many Mexicans died at the hands of criminals armed with weapons supplied courtesy of the ATF, but Carlos Canino, an ATF agent at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City, reportedly testified to congressional investigators that Fast and Furious guns showed up at nearly 200 crime scenes. This scandal is about dead Mexicans. As politicians in Washington have been known to ask: Where's the outrage? There isn't much of it, and what little there is seems to be reserved for political adversaries. Republicans, led by Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, have expressed outrage that the administration spent months stonewalling an investigation into the program by refusing to honor requests for information. More recently, they're questioning whether Attorney General Eric Holder might have committed perjury when -- after being asked by the committee in May 2011 when he had learned of the operation -- he responded: ""I'm not sure of the exact date, but I probably heard about Fast and Furious for the first time over the last few weeks."" Internal e-mails obtained by CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson -- who months ago was the first reporter to break this story on a major network with the help of ATF whistle-blowers -- suggest otherwise. The e-mails show that Holder was given regular briefings on the program as far back as July 2010. That would appear to contradict his testimony to Congress. When Attkisson asked Justice Department officials about the apparent contradiction, their initial response was to claim that the e-mails in question were about a different operation that started before Holder took office. Then they shifted gears and claimed that Holder misunderstood the question. He did know about Fast and Furious, they said, just not the details. More recently, the administration has shifted gears once again and apparently decided that the best defense is a good offense. Not surprisingly, Attkisson is now intensely unpopular with both the Justice Department and White House. The reporter told radio talk-show host Laura Ingraham that -- as she worked the story -- a woman from the Justice Department (whom she identified as Tracy Schmaler) ""was just yelling at me"" and that someone from the White House (whom she identified as Eric Schultz) ""screamed at me and cussed at me."" Last week, Holder went on the attack. He lashed out at Issa and other Republican critics of his handling of the operation, charging them with using ""irresponsible and inflammatory rhetoric."" And he urged people in both parties to repudiate such language ""in the strongest possible terms."" Holder also insisted: ""My testimony was truthful and accurate. ... I have no recollection of knowing about Fast and Furious or of hearing its name prior to the public controversy about it. Prior to early 2011, I certainly never knew about the tactics employed in the operation."" At this rate, who knows what the attorney general's next strategy will be? We're going to find out. Issa has subpoenaed Holder to appear before his committee again. Bully for Issa. We need to get to the bottom of this scandal, and if the administration isn't cooperating, there is all the more reason to keep digging. That also goes for Attkisson and CBS News, who have done first-rate work. Frankly, I am surprised by Holder's use of words such as ""irresponsible"" and ""inflammatory."" What could be more irresponsible than allowing weapons to be smuggled into a foreign country, weapons that then wind up killing the citizens of that country? And what could be more inflammatory than appearing to cover up such an operation and distancing oneself from it as staffers allegedly yell, scream and curse at reporters who are just doing their jobs? And what was the purpose of these alleged theatrics? Was all this huffing and puffing intended to get Attkisson to back off the story? Brilliant. As a former reporter, let me give the administration a tip: Attacking journalists is usually as effective in stamping out a story as gasoline is in putting out a fire.

"(Health.com) -- I can't prove it, but I think Eva Longoria might have thirty-four hours in each of her days. How else could she possibly fit it all in? Today, for instance, the Texas-born actress, 36, is in the car on her way to the airport. She's flying to New York to promote ""Desperate Housewives,"" which will wrap in May after eight crazy-successful seasons. And what'll she do the first morning after filming ends? ""Sleep!"" she laughs. After call times at 5:30 a.m., she says, ""I haven't had sleep in eight years."" No doubt. In addition to her day job, Eva moonlights at many passions: She runs Eva's Heroes, the nonprofit she founded, inspired by her developmentally disabled sister. She also co-owns Beso restaurants in Hollywood and Las Vegas, wrote the best-selling cookbook Eva's Kitchen, executive produced ""The Harvest"" (a documentary about child migrant farm laborers), and is getting her master's degree in political science and Chicano studies. Before she zips across the country, Eva talks food, the day she walked over hot coals, and the positive phrase that helped her get through her divorce. Q: How do you define a healthy life? People think health only has to do with your physical being, but for me, it's so much more. I remember after my divorce, I was so thin and everyone kept saying how great I looked and it was probably the most unhealthy place I've ever been. So it was funny what people would see as ""healthy."" In my worst time, people were saying I've never looked better. [But now] I have a great diet and exercise routine. And I try to have a healthy outlook. I'm your everlasting, hopeless optimist! Health.com: The biggest celebrity health stories of 2011 . Q: Where does your positive attitude come from? I was just born with that. It's so funny, because I don't get depressed. Even after my divorce, everybody was like, ""Wow, you bounced back so quick."" I was like, ""I am not letting this take over. Something great is around the corner -- I can't wait to see what's going to happen."" Q: You mentioned eating well and exercising. What's your go-to? I love to cook. But when I'm on set, I have food delivery sent there. Before I could afford a food delivery system, I would make my breakfast and lunch, I'd pack some snacks, and put almonds in my purse. I was always prepared because I was always hungry. It's funny, I would be like, ""Nuts anyone?"" And they'd say, ""What is in your purse?"" Q: So it looks like you're eating grub from the bottom of your purse. Yeah, exactly. Just the raw almonds, I soak them in water overnight. It makes them plump, and they pop in your mouth. I learned that from a Tony Robbins seminar. Fifteen years ago, I went and after that I became a vegan. For, like, a year, because I was just like, ""Oh my God, he's scared me into never eating meat again!"" [Laughs] It didn't last though. Health.com: Mouthwatering meatless meals . Q: Did the Tony Robbins seminar change anything else for you? No, it just confirmed everything that I was already doing. You know, ""Take charge of your life!"" I am. That's why I'm here! I did walk the coals. I walked over the fire. I love self-help, anything that's going to move you forward in life. The second I saw 'The Secret,' I was going, ""Oh, I live my life this way. So I'm doing good."" Q: Do you like to exercise? My bachelor's degree is in kinesiology, so it's ingrained in me to work out. I was an aerobics instructor, and a personal trainer in college, so I was addicted to exercise. I used to do an hour and a half to two hours a day. I'd teach a class and then train clients. And I realized I didn't need that much. Now I like weight training and abs. I love abs. I hate the elliptical. I hate jogging. [Laughs] I despise cardio. I just...can't do it. So I try to do my cardio within the workout. Q: What's your big health regret? Well, I think the time that I became a vegan. [Laughs] I love the philosophy behind veganism, but I went from one day eating chicken and meat to eating just salad. I didn't know how to be a vegan. I didn't know about soy or almond butter. I didn't know that there are great breads. So I literally stuck to salads. And I think I passed out the first week. Health.com: Celebrities who embraced natural medicine . Q: What do you like to cook? I love chicken leg quarters and asparagus. My most requested thing to cook for friends is Mexican tortilla soup and guacamole and chili-rubbed skirt steak. Q: Do you have any beauty secrets you learned growing up? After I shower, I put baby oil all over my body. And then you dry that off so you have the smoothest, softest skin. Q: I feel like you've been on every ""most beautiful"" list there is. Oh, God no. I was talking to Kim [Kardashian] about this the other day. I said, ""You're the most beautiful thing in the world,"" and she said, ""No, you are."" And I said, ""No, I used to be."" [Laughs] I was like, ""No, honey, I'm old news."" Q: Do you feel pressure to keep up with the whole ""beautiful"" thing? No. I think that's probably why I make those lists, because it takes a village to build me for the red carpet. It's an illusion created by stylists, hair, makeup. I don't put as much effort into it as my team does. But I think people see something beyond that with me, and I love that I'm defined by my charity work. I think that's what people see when they give me this label of ""She's a beautiful person."" Q: You're so busy. What's the most relaxing thing you do all day? I love to get in bed and turn on Bill Maher. I save five in a row and fall asleep to him ranting about something.

"TOKYO (CNN) -- The U.S. military held a ""Day of Reflection"" on Friday for troops in Japan after allegations that two U.S. service members committed sexual assaults on the southern island of Okinawa. Protestors in Okinawa express anger at claims two U.S. service members committed sexual assaults . The goal is to emphasize professionalism and core military values, the U.S. military said. Service members will meet in small groups to discuss topics such as personal values, responsible alcohol consumption, and understanding ethnic differences between the United States and Japan, the military said. The ""Day of Reflection"" follows the arrest last week of a U.S. Marine for the alleged rape of a 14-year-old Japanese girl and allegations Thursday that an employee of the U.S. Army raped a Filipino woman. Both incidents allegedly happened on Okinawa, where people have long resented the presence of the U.S. military. ""As responsible members of the Japanese community, and consistent with the values of our military, we will continue to do everything possible to prevent incidents,"" said Lt. Gen. Bruce A. Wright, commander of the U.S. forces in Japan. ""Every service member is expected to take personal responsibility for his or her off-duty conduct and we will continue to be unwavering in our commitment to maintain exemplary, high standards of professionalism,"" he said. The Okinawa prosecutor extended custody Friday for Tyrone Hadnott, the 38-year-old Marine accused in the rape of the teenager. That gives Japanese authorities until March 3 to file charges against him. Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda has condemned the incident as ""unforgivable,"" and the allegation prompted the U.S. military in Japan to form a sexual assault prevention task force. The episode echoes an incident more than a decade ago that strained relations between the United States and Japan, and similar cases have further fueled resentment of the U.S. military presence. Police in Okinawa said Thursday they were investigating a second reported sexual assault involving an employee of the U.S. Army. It was not clear whether the suspect in the case is a soldier or a civilian employee at the military's base in Japan. The U.S. Army in Japan said it was aware of the incident but did not give further details. ""We are in full cooperation with host nation authorities,"" the Army said in a statement. ""We take this allegation very seriously and the Army does not tolerate sexual assault."" U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill met Thursday with Japan's foreign minister and expressed regret over the recent incidents. ""I just want to make very clear the great regret that we feel about this, the concern that we feel for the Okinawa people,"" Hill said. The U.S. military announced Wednesday that it was restricting the movements of all American troops and their families in Okinawa because of the allegation involving the Japanese girl. The restrictions are in place ""indefinitely"" to allow troops and their families to reflect on discipline and conduct, the military said. It means troops and their families cannot leave their bases or off-base residences except for work, worship, school or medical needs. Friday's day of reflection was a more focused part of those restrictions. It was taking part in more than 23 locations on Okinawa and mainland Japan, the military said. ""As a practical matter, we need to reel it in here and make sure we are on our best, best behavior,"" said Col. Jeff Newell, commander of the 374th Airlift Wing at Yokota Air Base. Newell spoke to his airmen at the base as part of the day of reflection, speaking about topics like responsible drinking and sexual assault prevention. ""The point we want to make here is the strategic impact of any American serviceman's behavior when they're off-base,"" Newell said. More than 40,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan, most of them on Okinawa. They were placed there under a security alliance after Japan was defeated in World War II. Locals have long complained about crime, noise, and accidents by the U.S. military, but resentment boiled over in 1995 after a 12-year-old Okinawan schoolgirl was gang-raped by three American servicemen. The military observed a similar ""Day of Reflection"" after that incident. Women's rights activist Mina Watanabe said Friday's day of reflection is just lip service. She said reported sexual assaults committed by U.S. servicemen on Okinawa have continued despite years of promises to prevent them. ""The U.S. military bases in Okinawa and Japan are not welcome,"" Watanabe said. ""They don't protect the safety of the local community. It's more danger for the community."" E-mail to a friend .

"Editor's note: Thomas Maier is the author of ""The Kennedys: America's Emerald Kings,"" (Basic Books), which was the basis of a Warner Bros. video documentary released in November. He is a reporter for Newsday. Thomas Maier says Ted Kennedy's immigrant heritage helped drive his advocacy of a more open America. (CNN) -- With a sign from Dunganstown, Ireland, hanging in his U.S. Capitol office, a reminder of the famine-ravished farm where his ancestors began, Sen. Edward ""Ted"" Kennedy always seemed to understand that the Kennedys were perhaps America's greatest immigrant story -- overcoming religious, ethnic and cultural barriers to reach once unimaginable heights. ""My brother Jack wrote 'A Nation of Immigrants' in 1958, and his words ring true as clearly today as they did half a century ago,"" said Ted early last year, a few months before he was struck with a malignant brain tumor that claimed his life Tuesday. ""I'm constantly reminded of my immigrant heritage."" Indeed, the Kennedys' vision of ""A Nation of Immigrants"" -- which Ted championed throughout his public career -- dramatically transformed today's America, opening the door for millions of new citizens and paving the way for Barack Obama's presidency. It is the Kennedys' most lasting legacy. John F. Kennedy's idealistic belief in America's dream of opportunity for all was clearly stated in ""A Nation of Immigrants,"" which reflected so much of his family's story as Irish Catholic immigrants. The essence of this little known, little-studied book became the 1965 Immigration Reform Act, which ended the discriminatory preference given to white Europeans and opened the door to millions from Latin America, Asia, Africa and around the world. First proposed by President Kennedy in July 1963, a few months before his assassination, the bill was passed in his memory, pushed by his two brothers in the U.S. Senate and signed by President Lyndon Johnson beneath the Statue of Liberty. Ted was particularly proud of its passage and referred to it often in public. No law in our lifetime has done more to change the demographics of modern America. Many historians routinely ignore, or give only a passing nod, to the underlying forces of ethnicity and religion that so often influenced the Kennedy family's actions and outlook. Often their years in power were lionized as ""Camelot"" by the press. But as Ted Kennedy realized, a comparison to British royalty hardly seemed proper for the great-grandson of an Irish migrant worker who fled from a Dunganstown, County Wexford, farm during the Great Famine. That Dunganstown sign in Ted's office was a reminder of the Kennedys' sense of their own immigrant heritage, their epic encounters with religious bigotry, and how the complex dynamics of their family life reflected the Irish Catholic experience in America. From his grandfather, former Boston Mayor John F. ""Honey Fitz"" Fitzgerald, young Ted heard of the great wave of Irish immigrants to America that included their family. And in the 1990s, the efforts of Ted and his sister, U.S. Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith, to bring peace to their ancestral homeland seemed to reflect their deeper sense of being Irish, of being Catholic and of being members of a family coming from an often oppressed immigrant minority. Ted went back to Ireland many times, including to the old Kennedy homestead in Dunganstown. The culmination of this Kennedy's immigrant legacy was most apparent by the 2008 presidential campaign, which offered many reminders for Ted Kennedy of the barriers his brother faced in 1960, becoming the first U.S. president from a minority background. Most notably, Obama, the U.S. senator from Illinois, possessed a style and dignity particularly reminiscent of the Kennedy era. At a key moment in the primary campaign, Ted Kennedy publicly supported Obama who, in turn, said the Kennedy family always stood for ""what is best about America."" Obama's campaign faced many tests similar to those that John Kennedy endured in 1960 as the first and only Roman Catholic elected to the presidency. As a minority, born to black and white parents, Obama had to overcome code words and subtle biases historically applied to African-Americans. Like Catholic hard-liners who complained that Kennedy wasn't ""Catholic enough"" in 1960, Obama was sometimes criticized within the black community for not seeming ""black enough"" in 2008. And yet when the media made it seem Obama had been attacked for his minority status, African-Americans rallied to his support, just as Catholics did in 1960 for Kennedy. Ted Kennedy's dramatic embrace of Obama's candidacy carried a powerful symbolism, one of the last significant acts of his distinguished career before he fell ill. From the broadest vantage, the Kennedy story reminds us of the glories and the limits of America's melting pot and those histories that paint people from minority groups in familiar ""just like us"" tones. We gain a better grasp of the Kennedys' appeal beyond Irish Catholics -- to countless other immigrant and minority groups who share a dream of ascendancy in America. In this context, our understanding of the Kennedys becomes richer, more complex and of greater historical significance to what John Kennedy called a nation of immigrants. It recalls how far we've progressed as a country since the 1960 election, and yet how many barriers still remain today. No one understood that better than Ted Kennedy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas Maier.","Thomas Maier: Kennedy's heritage was of an immigrant family that broke barriers .

"(CNN) -- Sometimes the journey is the destination. These rail adventures, from the modest to the most decadent, offer a mix of breathtaking scenery, a window on the role of the railroad in North American history and opportunities to enjoy leisure and luxury while watching the world roll by. Metro-North: Manhattan to Poughkeepsie, New York . On your next visit to New York City, skip the pricey tourist traps for an inexpensive afternoon jaunt celebrating both river and rail that offers a glimpse into the golden age of passenger and freight train travel. Take Metro-North from landmark Grand Central Terminal to Poughkeepsie through the storied Hudson Valley, then stroll across the mighty Hudson 212 feet in the sky, atop a historic rail bridge that's been transformed into a pedestrian walkway. Let the adventure begin at Grand Central with an audio or self-guided tour including architectural highlights as well as ""little known secrets"" about the station's history. Before you set out, download the audio tour to your smartphone or print out a free self-guided tour map. Or rent a headset at the station. To fuel your imagination and make the most of this low-cost adventure, come to Metro-North prepared with a copy of Karl Zimmerman's book ""20th Century Limited."" The 20th Century was the iconic luxury train that ran this route from 1902 to 1967, transporting the glitterati from Manhattan to Chicago. ""It was the finest train in the world in its day,"" explains Henry Posner III, chairman of Railroad Development Corp., the Pittsburgh-based investor in railways worldwide, and a rail fan since the day he purchased his first copy of Trains magazine at age 14. ""Every time the train left the station it was a media event."" Photos: Illuminating an American railroad . With open eyes and an open mind, hop aboard the no-frills, workaday commuter rail for an under-two-hour, one-way journey that will cost you about $16, or slightly more during peak hours. Between glances out the window, flip the pages of Zimmerman's book, which tells the story, in words and pictures, of the train that carried celebrated passengers -- movie stars and moguls among them -- who partook of a full array of on-board services, including showers, barbers and secretaries. Appetite whetted by descriptions of gourmet meals served aboard the 20th Century, arrive in Poughkeepsie ready for lunch. Enjoy the view of the Hudson from the back deck of River Station Restaurant while digging into generous portions of steak, lobster or stuffed scallops, among other favorites. Show your Metro-North ticket for a 25% discount on your meal and then, depending on your energy level, hop on the restaurant's free shuttle, take a five-minute taxi ride or walk the 20 minutes to your next (free) destination, known as the ""Walkway Over the Hudson."" When it officially opened in 1889, the Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge was the longest bridge in North America. Once a pivotal transportation link, connecting western goods to eastern industry via rail, today it's the world's longest elevated pedestrian bridge. It stretches 1.28 miles, offering up spectacular panoramic views of the Catskill Mountains above and the sparkling river below. If all this river gazing leaves you wanting a closer look, consider rounding out your evening with an Empire Cruise in the Heart of the Hudson Valley -- a sightseeing riverboat ride on which you can hear stories of ""industrial barons, ladies of the Gilded Age and explorers of long ago."" Metro-North has discount packages available. Amtrak's Empire Builder: Chicago to Glacier National Park in Montana . This adventure begins in Chicago, though more enthusiastic rail fans might start their trip an hour and half northwest of the city in Union, Illinois, at the Illinois Railway Museum. It's said to be America's largest. Book your ticket to depart from Chicago's Union Station. For a comfortable, mid-price (about $375 to $800, depending on your travel dates) one-way Empire Builder ride, book a ""roomette"" aboard the double-decker Superliner. Slide into a recliner in front of your very own picture window, and let the 30-hour show begin. Once outside the city, the tracks breeze through thick Illinois woods, and then Wisconsin farmland. At dinnertime, choose from a menu that includes marinated steak and herb-roasted chicken, and by the time you finish dessert, Mississippi River birds and barges will have come into view. Settle into one of two bunks in your roomette against a backdrop of the twinkling lights of the Minneapolis and St. Paul skylines. Awake to see hay fields in the North Dakota plains. After breakfast -- blueberry compote French toast, anyone? -- venture out into the Sightseer Lounge, where a dome of windows allows for panoramic views and glimpses of prairie wildlife. On some trains, an on-board National Park Service guide will share the region's flora, fauna and cultural heritage. After lunch, head to the dining car for a wine and cheese tasting featuring Oregon and Wisconsin specialties, exclusively for sleeping car guests. Answer enough train trivia questions correctly and you could walk away with a free bottle of wine. Spend the evening enjoying your winnings while watching the Rocky Mountains launch themselves out of the prairie before you. Following a day of gazing onto Montana Big Sky country, prepare to disembark at one of three or four stops (depending on the season) within Glacier National Park. Dubbed ""Crown of the Continent,"" the park is a hiker's wonderland of mountains, forests, lakes, and alpine meadows. After 30 hours of watching leisurely as all these diverse vistas pass by, you'll be ready to stretch your legs and plunge feet first into the landscape. If you want to see the Pacific Northwest as you travel along portions of the Lewis and Clark Trail, get back on the Empire Builder and take the southern leg to Portland, Oregon, when the train splits at Spokane, Washington. The northern leg will take you to Seattle. Via Rail's Canadian: Toronto to Vancouver, Canada . The 20th Century Limited is now just a memory, but Via Rail's Canadian route offers a taste of modern rail luxury that draws more than 100,000 travelers each year. This four-day trip aboard newly renovated trains offers upscale accommodations and spectacular scenery, as well as the chance to step off the train and take in the flavor of several stops en route. Rail devotee Posner recommends taking this trip in the off-season, when relatively empty cars grant you the sense of being ""on your own private train,"" but keep in mind that Canadian winters aren't for the faint of heart. For an upscale journey, purchase a one-way Sleeper Plus ticket (from $1,336 to $2,120, depending on travel dates with occasional last-minute Express Deals). It includes a comfortable private cabin, a shared shower and all meals, as well as privileged access to the recently refurbished Park car, featuring 360-degree views on the upper observation deck as well as two elegant lounges. Kick off your long-haul Canadian adventure in Toronto at 10 p.m. and settle into your cabin, complete with a duvet, crisp white bed linens and a private vanity, sink and WC. Before long you'll reach the gateway to the Muskoka Lakes and, soon enough, ""dreamland"" as the gentle sway of the train lulls you to sleep. In the morning, draw the curtains on your big picture window to catch a glimpse of the billion-year-old exposed bedrock of the Canadian Shield, peppered with small settlements established at regular intervals to service locomotives. Head to the dining car for a lunch of Greenland turbot and Atlantic salmon cake wrapped with a thin salmon filet, Angus burger on ciabatta, or quinoa salad with pears and feta. Then work off your meal with a walk around Hornepayne, where a 40-minute stopover grants you the opportunity to explore the small town that sprang up solely because of the railroad. Log piles and plywood plants along the tracks display the town's current major industry: wood. The different ""slices of life"" revealed by stops like this one are exactly what Posner loves about the Canadian. When you reach Winnipeg on the morning of day three, take advantage of the nearly five-hour stop to explore the Forks, the historic shopping and dining district at the junction of the Assiniboine and Red rivers--a trading center for more than 6,000 years. Also make time, of course, for the Winnipeg Railway Museum, located right in the station, to view 37,500 square feet of railway artifacts, including the first steam locomotive on the Canadian prairies, the Countess of Dufferin, and an early diesel locomotive. Another must-see stop toward the end of your journey is Jasper, located right in the heart of the Canadian Rockies, where goats and elk graze along the tracks and a one-and-a-half-hour stopover is sufficient to explore the whole town on foot. Final stop: Vancouver, Canada's Pacific Coast gem, and the chance to sort through your photos and memories of the diversity of the country's landscapes, from the boreal forests to the prairies to the Rocky Mountains. Do you have any fond memories of riding the railroads recently or as a child?

"(CNN) -- Jo-Wilfried Tsonga is two victories away from becoming the first local male player to win the French Open in 30 years after he dismantled Roger Federer in a stunning 7-5 6-3 6-3 victory in Tuesday's quarterfinal. The 28-year-old must now beat Spanish fourth seed David Ferrer, who saw off compatriot Tommy Robredo in a 6-2 6-1 6-1 win, in the semifinal if he is to replicate Yannick Noah's 1983 triumph. Only one Frenchman has reached the men's singles finals at Roland Garros since, with Henri Laconte beaten by Mats Wilander of Sweden in 1988. Sixth seed Tsonga was in irresistible form on Tuesday as he atoned for the intense disappointment of his quarterfinal exit against Novak Djokovic last year, when he lost despite creating four match points. ""It's extraordinary to be here and to have won,"" he said. ""I could not have dreamed it any better. I played superbly and I beat a champion who has won everything."" When Federer took an early break in the first set, it seemed as though the Swiss would be coasting to yet another grand slam semifinal but the 28-year-old Frenchman rallied in superb form. The first Frenchman into the last four since Gael Monfils five years ago, Tsonga has reached his first semifinal at Roland Garros without dropping a set. Meanwhile, 31-year-old Federer -- who was bidding for an 18th grand slam title -- struggled to find any rhythm on a surface where he has never convinced. The defeat means the former world number one has failed to reach the semifinals of a grand slam for only the fifth time since 2004. Only one of his 17 grand slams has come in Paris, with the Swiss having won the Australian Open four times, the U.S. Open on five occasions and Wimbledon in seven different years. In a performance littered with 34 unforced errors, the demise of 2009 champions Federer came in just one hour and 51 minutes to the delight of those watching courtside at the Chatrier stadium. ""I thought he played great today,"" Federer said. ""He was, in all areas, better than me today. That's why the result was pretty clean. ""I was impressed by the way he played today. I think I struggled a little bit everywhere. To be honest, personally, I'm pretty sad about the match and the way I played."" Tsonga -- who lost his only grand slam final to Novak Djokovic at the 2008 Australian Open -- has triumphed in only one of his three meetings against Ferrer, when defeating the Spaniard at Wimbledon in 2011. Ferrer made light work of beating Robredo as he reached the semifinals at Roland Garros for the second year in succession, the key difference being that -- like Tsonga -- he has not dropped a set this time around. On Wednesday, the lineup for the second semifinal will be known when world No. 1 Novak Djokovic takes on Tommy Haas while Rafael Nadal will try to continue his domination of Paris when facing Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka.","Jo-Wilfried Tsonga beats Roger Federer in straight sets to reach French Open semifinals .

"(CNN) -- One of the drawbacks of Roombas, the robotic floor cleaning devices that automatically scoot around and suck up dirt, is that they are too big to clean what really matters. They fall off of pets, are miserable at dishes and they do very little for tablet and smartphone maintenance. A Japanese company is attempting to remedy at least one of those wrongs with a teeny, tiny Roomba-like screen cleaner for mobile devices called the AutoMee S. The wee gadget, spotted by Engadget is a fun and cheap little invention by Japanese company Takara Tomy. Drop the AutoMee S onto an iPad and it will buff the finger prints away, wandering around the screen in straight lines, ricocheting of the edges until the entire surface is clean. A sensor detects the edges of the phone or tablet so the device spins around to take another pass instead of wandering off onto your desk and accidentally cleaning unsuspecting pencils and mouse pads. If you're in a rush, a microfiber cloth is going to be much faster. It takes four minutes to clean a phone and eight minutes to fully cover a tablet using the AutoMee. But where's the fun in that? The plastic devices run on one AA battery, weighs a little less than 3 ounces, and come in four colors: white, blue, orange and pink. It will retail for 1575 Yen, or nearly $17, when it goes on sale in Japan at the end of March. Sure, it's a silly product. But it's actually an important task. Phones and tablets are teeming with bacteria such as E. coli that can cause illnesses. Wiping a screen down with a microfiber cloth will get rid of up to 99 percent of those germs. Using an alcohol-based cleaner is the best way to get all of the bacteria, but it can strip off the oleophobic (oil resistant) coating found on many touchscreen devices. Check the help section for you particular device before going in for a deep clean.","AutoMee is a tiny Roomba-like cleaning device for smartphones and tablets .

"(CNN) -- Military brass at Fort Hood, Texas, on Tuesday announced tightened security procedures and the availability of a range of mental health services in the wake of the November 5 shooting spree that killed 13 people on the post. Steps have been taken to tighten restrictions on who gets onto the post, to position armed guards in key locations including behavioral health facilities, and to carry out random inspections of containers, said Col. Bill Hill, garrison commander. ""Relaxed entry will cease,"" he told post personnel in a televised town hall meeting. All vehicles entering the post will be required to display a Department of Defense sticker or a secure pass, and some buildings will require badge access, he said. Security at both the fort's airfields also will be tightened, with guards and patrols on site, he said. Soldiers assigned to Fort Hood will have to register their personal firearms with the director of emergency services, he added. Fort Hood is home to some 50,000 active-duty soldiers and 18,000 of the soldiers' family members. The suspect in the shootings, Army psychiatrist Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, 39, has been charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder. Hasan, who was wounded by two civilian officers, is being treated at a hospital. Additional charges are under consideration, Col. Jeff Harris said. Many of the security changes have already been implemented, including additional searches at the gates and greater restrictions on who can get onto the post, said Lt. Gen. Bob Cone, Fort Hood's commanding general. But, Cone said, had the changes been in place on November 5, they might not have been enough. ""I don't think necessarily they would have had an effect on this event,"" he said. Among Fort Hood's resources for treating mental health problems -- including post-traumatic stress disorder -- are a 12-bed inpatient psychiatric ward, an outpatient clinic, a combat stress reset program, social services and substance abuse treatment, said Dr. Steve Braverman, commander of Fort Hood's Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center. After the attack, the post's mental health staff was augmented by 75 to 80 mental health workers, though some have gone back to other assignments, he said. Soldiers affected by the attack were screened for mental health problems afterward and will be rescreened 90 days after the event ""to ensure that any previously unidentified issues are addressed,"" Braverman said. A 24-hour ""behavioral health hot line"" is available, and a surveillance program ""to identify and monitor areas of concern"" will be started soon, he said. ""These findings may lead to targeted interventions for certain populations as we address these issues,"" Braverman said. Plans call for construction of an 82,000-square-foot facility in which behavioral health facilities would be consolidated, Braverman said. Soldiers in need of care can also make appointments with their primary care providers, he said. The objective, Braverman said, is ""to restore trust and confidence in Army medicine."" Despite the availability of resources, many soldiers have expressed reluctance to seek mental health care, fearing that doing so would adversely affect their careers. ""There is a perception of stigma,"" Cone said. But Braverman said treatment need not hinder anyone's career. ""If you are seen in our system, while there's information in the medical records, that's not allowed to be used for any determination of security levels or future assignments,"" he said. ""This is really all about us regaining the trust in our community, in our soldiers, in our security, in our installation,"" Cone said. ""That was taken from us, and what we have to do is take it back, and that is done one person at a time."" He added: ""If there is someone out there who is hurting, I assure you there are resources in place and we can take care of them.""","Fort Hood tightens restrictions on who is allowed onto post .

"(CNN) -- Kate Upton graces the cover of Sports Illustrated's annual swimsuit issue, barely suited up in Antarctica's early spring weather of about 24 degrees Fahrenheit. (With wind chill, it felt like minus 20 degrees). Upton doesn't show any signs of goose bumps in the pictures. She no doubt got the chilliest assignment of the 17 models who posed for this year's swimsuit issue on seven continents. Those logistics are the work of Sports Illustrated's senior editor for the swimsuit issue, MJ Day, and her team, who spend most of the year on the road shooting. For this year's 50th annual issue, years of negotiating visas and access paid off in shots on each of the world's seven continents. (Sports Illustrated, like CNN, is a division of Time Warner.) Antarctica was ""the 'Hail Mary' pass of our year,"" said Day, using perhaps the only sports metaphor applicable to the issue, on newsstands February 12. ""I could have had a blizzard. Kate could have had shivering fits you could not shoot around. (Instead) we had six days of perfect weather."" Day packed coats and wool socks for that trip in addition to the items more typically in her travel bags: Some 500 to 800 bathing suits, double stick tape, clothespins, safety pins, binder clips, liners from the cups of bathing suits (for use as knee pads), suntan lotion, bug spray and flip-flops. While Day is a veteran road warrior traveling to many places most people will never see, even she was taken by her adventures this past year. Here are Day's favorite spots from her year's travels on each of the continents. 8 getaways we wish we could afford . Antarctica: Kodak Alley . The Sports Illustrated team traveled to Antarctica in early December (early spring on the frozen continent) on the Abercrombie & Kent ship Le Boreal, enjoying a rare ""six-day stretch of perfect weather"" on the journey from Tierra del Fuego. ""Antarctica was my favorite place on Earth,"" said Day. ""I'm one of the most jaded travelers you will ever meet, but the whole thing was a religious experience. Spend your money. It's worth it."" On the journey, they crossed a channel called Kodak Alley, where twilight arrived around midnight. ""The sun sets in a shade of orange and mountains turn pink -- not a hint of pink, but as if someone poured pink paint over the mountains. You can't sleep because it's too awe-inspiring. Sleeping is not important. Seeing this is."" The photographer could only shoot Upton outside for a couple of minutes at a time before the crew, all bundled from head to toe, would rush to put heating pads in her bathing suit and cover her with electric warming coats. ""The entire crew surprised her the last day of her (six-day) shoot wearing bathing suits as a sign of support and thanks,"" said Day. ""I was probably in my suit for five minutes and went so numb."" Africa: Wolwedans, NamibRand Nature Reserve, Namibia . Wolwedans is a group of lodges and camps that are part of the privately held NamibRand Nature Reserve in the southwest Namib Desert. ""I've been to sandy places such as Tunisia and the Sahara and seen those endless dunes, but the dunes here were the most intense shade of red I've ever seen in my life,"" said Day. ""The sand in Namibia has such a high iron content. As the iron oxidizes, the redder it becomes. The further inland you go, the redder the sand gets: white to orange to insane red."" The Wolwedans runs on solar power, which means no sounds of generators to disturb the natural beauty. The lodge grows some of its own food and runs in partnership with a culinary school, ""so the food is incredible, really wholesome, delicious and natural. You feel like 'I'm living and I'm living right.'"" ""The level of quiet you experience is surreal. This is the perfect place to go to when you need to rest your soul."" The perfect beach for you . Asia: Dragon's Backbone Rice Terraces, China . It took more than two years to negotiate the visas to get into China to shoot, and Day wasn't sure it would ever happen. The shoot came to life at Dragon's Backbone Rice Terraces, an 800-year-old terraced rice paddy built into the mountains in Guangxi Province. ""It's the most ethereal, beautiful, surprising place on Earth to me,"" said Day. ""These incredibly distinctive mountains were like what kids draw, up and down and up down. They were incredibly green, rich, lush and misty in the mornings."" The hike is so strenuous up the mountain stairs that many visitors hire the local Yao women to act as guides. The women of the Yao ethnic minority group, who are known for their brightly colored clothing and long hair styled atop their heads, helped the crew haul equipment for the shoots at the bottom and top of the hike, and at points along the way. World's most romantic islands . Australia: Whitehaven Beach, Whitsunday Island . It takes a lot for a beach to impress Day, who is not impressed by the backdrop that most beaches have to offer a photo shoot. Whitehaven Beach also wasn't an easy spot for a shoot: It takes a 20-minute seaplane ride or longer boat ride to get there, and there weren't any amenities. (Just a handful of the 74 islands known as the Whitsundays have accommodations.) So the team stayed on nearby Hayman Island, another one of the Whitsunday islands and took off at first light for two days of shooting on the white sand silica beach. ""It's quite honestly one of the most beautiful striking and isolated beaches I've ever been to,"" said Day. ""People claim it's the most pristine beach in the world. The water is right off the barrier reef, and it's this incredible shade of turquoise. It's not close to anything. You have to pack in and pack out."" Europe: Seville, Spain . May adored the elegance of Seville, with its blend of Moorish and Spanish culture. While she and her team usually work wearing T-shirts, baseball caps and jeans, she dressed up a bit for the Seville shoots and packed dresses and heels for dinner after work in the capital of Spain's sun-splashed Andalucia province. ""It's an incredibly ornate city,"" she said. ""People are so regal. They get dressed to go out (anywhere). I don't think I saw a pair of sweats when I was there. And everywhere you look there's another shot."" While she had trouble choosing a favorite spot in Seville, she did enjoy shooting in the Plaza de Espana and near the Catedral de Sevilla, the largest Gothic building in Europe. They also did photo shoots with horses at an equestrian school ""with amazing white stallions, jumping."" 7 swanky ski hotels on U.S. slopes . North America: The Exuma Cays, Bahamas . Back to the beach, Day chose a spot where she has worked before to shoot the swimsuit issue's body painting story. She values the Exumas, an archipelago of 365 cays about 35 miles from Nassau, for its privacy and solitude. ""You're not fighting for blanket space on the beach and the waters are perfectly turquoise,"" she said. ""We saw the most glorious sunsets you've ever seen in your life. Every day, the tide would change and look different."" South America: Easter Island, Chile . Visiting Easter Island has been on May's bucket list for some time, but even after landing in the remote island, she wasn't sure she would get her shot. Lots of on-site negotiation went into getting permission to shoot close to the sacred Moai statues, more than 800 of which were carved from the island's volcanic stone sometime between the ninth and 17th centuries. ""Everyone knows about it but they're just getting their hook into tourism, and they've embraced ecotourism,"" she said. The differences in topography on Easter Island made for a great shoot: ""There are black rocks, deforested planes, the Moai jutting out,"" said Day. ""They've replanted a lot and a couple spots look like you're in Hawaii with white sand beaches. "" It's a tough job, but someone's got to do it. Can airliners really fly upside down?","Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue editor travels the world much of the year for her work .

"(CNN) -- Australian wonder mare Black Caviar extended her unbeaten streak to 25 races in some style on Saturday, blowing away her rivals in the TJ Smith Stakes at Sydney's Randwick Racecourse. Her 25th victory was also her 15th at the sports highest level, overtaking the mark of 14 Group 1 wins set by the legendary Kingston Town in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was in 2011 that Black Caviar posted what many consider her greatest-ever performance in this very race, beating Hay List by three lengths after trailing him by the same distance coming into the home straight. On this occasion no such heroics were required. Facing one of her toughest-ever fields, including her old foe Hay List, admittedly not the force he once was, and the in-form Bel Sprinter, Black Caviar's regular rider Luke Nolen had to jockey for position in the early stages as he sought to overcome an unfavorable inside draw. The decisive move came around 300 meters out, when Nolen guided her away from the softer ground by the rail and settled her behind the leaders towards the middle of the track. From there, all Nolen had to do was pull the pin and the six-year-old instantly responded, lengthening away from the rest of the field with her to claim her eight consecutive Group 1 win. All day Sydneysiders had celebrated the presence of one of Australia's most popular sporting heroes. Flags in her trademark salmon and black colors fluttered over Sydney's iconic harbor, while the capacity crowd ensured Randwick Racecourse was filled the rafters. Speaking after the race, Black Caviar's trainer Peter Moody praised the crowd, adding that he was ""extremely proud"" of his mare for breaking Kingston Town's record. As Black Caviar was cheered on her way back to the winners' enclosure her jockey noted, ""You can see what she means to racing. To be part of that -- words escape me."" With Black Caviar's form seemingly better than ever despite her age, her connections have hinted that a return to Royal Ascot, scene of her narrowest-ever victory, may be on the cards later this summer before a rendezvous with Frankel in the breeding shed in what would surely be considered the racing world's own royal wedding.","Black Caviar wins 25th straight race on Saturday in Sydney -- 15th straight at highest level .

"(CNN) -- Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs threatened to hit Palm with patent litigation if the company did not stop poaching valuable employees, according to a newly unsealed court filing (hat tip to Reuters). The document surfaced as part of a lawsuit between former employees of companies like Apple, Google, and Intel over the companies' no-poaching agreements; US District Judge Lucy Koh denied parts of a request to keep some documents sealed, revealing Jobs' comments to Palm CEO Edward Colligan. According to the document, which was filed late Tuesday, both Apple and Palm hired one another's employees during Colligan's tenure between 2003 and 2009. Colligan claims Jobs called him in August of 2007 — roughly two months after the public launch of the iPhone — to propose ""an agreement"" wherein Palm and Apple would not hire employees away from each other. Colligan's statement notes that the agreement contained a pretty strong ""or else"" clause: ""Mr. Jobs also suggested that if Palm did not agree to such an arrangement, Palm could face lawsuits alleging infringement of Apple's many patents."" Steve Jobs' yacht impounded over pay dispute . Colligan sent an e-mail response to Jobs expressing his concern over the discussion. ""Your proposal that we agree that neither company will hire the other's employees, regardless of the individual's desires, is not only wrong, it is likely illegal,"" Colligan wrote to Jobs on August 24, 2007. Colligan went on to point out that Palm recruits employees based on talent, not because Palm wants to hurt other companies. ""Threatening Palm with a patent lawsuit in response to a decision by one employee to leave Apple is just out of line. A lawsuit would not serve either of our interests and will not stop employees from migrating between our companies. [...] We will both just end up paying a lot of lawyers a lot of money."" Jobs replied a few hours later with a much shorter message. ""This is not satisfactory to Apple,"" Jobs wrote. ""I'm sure you realize the asymmetry in the financial resources of our respective companies when you say: 'We will both just end up paying a lot of lawyers a lot of money.'"" Photo: Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs in 'jOBS' Jobs ended his letter by suggesting Colligan ""take a look at our patent portfolio before you make a final decision here."" As noted by MacRumors, Walter Isaacson's 2011 biography of Steve Jobs made reference to Jobs' anger at Palm over the hiring of Apple employees, but did not discuss Jobs' threat of patent litigation. Other companies involved in the lawsuit — including Apple, Adobe, Google, Intel, Intuit, and Pixar — had indeed begun to agree not to cold call each other's employees at that time. The US Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against the companies and forced them to dissolve the agreements in 2010, but the current lawsuit is a civil complaint filed by five former employees. Current Apple CEO Tim Cook has been ordered by Judge Koh to give a deposition about Apple's role in the alleged collusion, although Apple argues that only Jobs was involved in the discussion and that Cook had no knowledge of the agreements. 10 things Steve Jobs taught us .

"(CNN) -- Google unveiled a groundbreaking new Chromebook laptop Thursday — one with touchscreen capability, powerful chipset and an extremely high-resolution display. The Chromebook Pixel, available for order on the Google Play store and shipping in April, features a 12.85-inch touch-sensitive Gorilla Glass screen. The resolution is 4.3 million pixels, which works out to 239 pixels per inch. (The average Windows laptop has about half that; technically, it also beats the Macbook Retina.) The Pixel will come in two versions, both boasting an Intel Core i5 processor. The basic model is Wi-Fi only; a more expensive model has the ability to connect to Verizon's superfast LTE network. Google claims a battery life of five hours on the device, which has QuickOffice built into the browser and an SD card slot for automatic photo uploads to Google+. Those features can also be used offline (uploads queued for later, of course). The price, however, is relatively steep: $1,299 for the Wi-Fi only version, $1,449 for the LTE model. Google was careful to emphasize that the Pixel isn't for everyone. ""This is for power users who live in the cloud,"" Senior Vice President of Chrome Sundar Pichai repeatedly told a select group of journalists at a low-key launch event in San Francisco. Having a touchscreen doesn't mean that Google plans to integrate its mobile OS, Android, into the device. But Pichai hoped web developers would start making their interfaces touch-sensitive — so that content on the device would be indistinguishable from Android. ""Touch is here to stay, and I'm pretty sure every laptop will have touch in the future,"" Pichai said. ""Using a laptop with touch seems strange at first, but your day-to-day browser experience starts changing. In our tests, users started replacing the touchpad pretty quickly."" The aluminum-coated Pixel was designed and built by Google, with help from other unnamed PC manufacturers. Plenty of thought appears to have gone into the design: For example, there's an extra laser microphone under the keyboard, complementing the two mics next to the camera, allowing the software to cancel out any noise you might make while typing on a video conference. ""Our goal was to have the hardware disappear,"" Pichai added. Did Google achieve its goal? We've got our hands on a Pixel Chromebook and will post a hands on soon.

"(CNN) -- One of the busiest travel weeks of the year is upon us. With the uproar over the Transportation Security Administration's new airport security measures reaching a fever pitch, CNN has put together a short Q&A to separate fact from myth and answer basic questions about what to expect if you're flying this holiday season. Q) What exactly are the new TSA rules? A) When you arrive in the airport security checkpoint, you will be directed to either a traditional metal detector or one of the new advanced imaging technology (AIT) machines. Passengers directed to the AIT machines can instead opt for an ""enhanced"" pat-down. Q) Will the checkpoint look very different when I arrive? A) No. The only noticeable difference may be the presence of the AIT machines, which are larger than metal detectors. Q) Does every airport have the AIT machines? A) No. There are approximately 400 AIT machines installed in 69 airports nationwide. The rest of the country's roughly 450 commercial airports still only use metal detectors. Q) Does everyone go through the AIT machines? A) No. As noted above, most airports in the United States don't have the AIT machines yet. And even if your airport has them, you may still be asked to go through a metal detector instead. Q) What sorts of images do the AIT machines show? A) They show a somewhat blurred outline of the passenger's body. Clear facial features are not shown. Q) Is anyone exempt from the AIT machines? A) Yes -- working pilots. Q) Is advanced imaging technology dangerous? A) There are actually two types of advanced imaging technology -- backscatter X-ray technology and millimeter-wave technology. Backscatter technology has raised concerns among some experts because it uses small doses of ionizing radiation. Radiation experts say millimeter-wave technology poses no known health risks. The TSA says travelers are exposed to less radiation during an AIT scan than they would from two minutes of an airline flight. In other words, according to the TSA, it's safe. Q) Is the use of advanced imaging technology a violation of my rights? A) It depends who you ask. Several lawsuits have been filed. One public interest research group is seeking a suspension of the body scanning program, arguing that the measures violate the Fourth Amendment and the Privacy Act, among other laws. Courts, however, have traditionally given wide leeway for airport screening under the Fourth Amendment, according to Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor who specializes in American constitutional law. Q) Does everyone get the new enhanced pat-down? A) No. Fewer than 3 percent of the flying public are subjected to the enhanced pat-down, according to the TSA. Pat-downs are used primarily on passengers who set off either the AIT machine or the metal detectors, and those who opt out of the AIT machine. A few randomly selected passengers will be subjected to a pat down even if they clear the metal detector or AIT machine. Q) What's included in the enhanced pat-down? A) The TSA doesn't provide an exact description of the new pat-down procedure. Passengers subjected to the screening, however, have indicated that TSA representatives have probed their entire body, including the posterior, crotch, and chest. Q) Why is the enhanced pat-down necessary? A) ""It just makes good security sense,"" the TSA says on its website. ""The weapons and other dangerous and prohibited items we've found during pat-downs speak to this."" Q) Am I going to be subjected to a pat-down in front of fellow passengers? A) You can request to have the pat-down conducted in a private room with a passenger witness of your choosing. Q) I have a metal implant in my body. Am I more likely to require a pat-down? A) No. In fact, if you go through an AIT machine, you may be less likely to require a pat-down. A metal detector will be set off by the presence of metal inside the body -- potentially leading to a pat-down. The AIT scans the exterior of the body, and should therefore not detect the presence of metal inside the body. Q) Are kids exempt from enhanced pat-downs? A) Children under the age of 12 requiring additional screening will receive ""a modified pat down,"" according to the TSA. Q) What happens if I refuse to go through a complete screening? A) Passengers who refuse complete screening won't be allowed past security and could face civil penalties, according to a TSA statement. Q) Will all airports have the new AIT scanning machines in the future? A) That's the goal. CNN's Alan Silverleib and Marnie Hunter contributed to this report .","The new rules require passengers to go through a regular metal detector or a new AIT machine .
If you set off the detector or machine -- or refuse to go through them -- you will get an ""enhanced"" pat-down .
The new advanced imaging technology machine is generally considered safe .
Only 3 percent of the flying public will likely need an enhanced pat-down ."
"(CNN) -- Iconic jockey Frankie Dettori was cleared to return to racing by the governing body of the sport in France Thursday after serving a six-month ban for cocaine use. The 42-year-old Italian tested positive for the drug at a meeting at Longchamp in Paris last September and he was subsequently suspended by France Galop. The ban was also reciprocated by the British Horse Racing Authority (BHA). Dettori was due to make his comeback last week but was thwarted in his efforts after a test carried out by France Galop produced, according to the BHA, an ""irregularity"". Dettori met with France Galop's medical committee Tuesday to discuss a ""private matter"", the resolution of which means the rider can now return to the saddle. The decision to return his license means that Dettori is eligible to compete in Britain's most famous horse race, the Epsom Derby Saturday. But his likely ride in the Classic, top trainer Aiden O'Brien's colt Magician, who won the Irish 2,000 Guineas, is a non-runner. That will leave Dettori's only chance to be as a late substitute for another jockey, but he is set to ride in two races at the Epsom meeting Friday. His first Classic ride is set to be in the French Derby at Chantilly Sunday where he has been slated to ride Andrew Oliver's First Cornerstone. The world of racing was stunned last year when news of Dettori's misdemeanor became public and he vowed to ""rebuild his reputation"" in accepting his punishment. He has acquired celebrity status in Britain where he is based -- becoming a household name after riding seven straight winners at the famous English racecourse Ascot in 1996. Dettori has secured more than 500 Group-level victories in his career -- the majority for the Godolphin stable -- winning 14 British Classics with three wins in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Europe's most prestigious race. But he will ride as a freelance in the 2013 season after announcing the end of his full-time role with Sheikh Mohammed's Goldolphin operation shortly before he was banned.","Jockey Frankie Dettori cleared to return to competitive action .

"Geneva, Switzerland (CNN) -- Sitting at the first Africa CEO Forum this week, in the heart of Geneva, I asked myself if this was the right time to open the debate on Africa's private sector future. Was Geneva the right place? Critics will rightly argue that this sort of event should have been held in Africa. Over two intensive days, top African chief executive officers shared with attendees from all over the Africa, Europe and Asia, some latest trends and best practices, discussed the future of the continent's private sector, and received awards and accolades. Speakers such as the outspoken Sudanese-born billionaire Mo Ibrahim tried to boost the narratives of Africa's position compared to China and India but with little solutions to offer. When I asked him why the event was not held in Accra or Johannesburg, Ibrahim replied by stating that the reasons were more infrastructural and logistical than anything else. Paul Collier (Oxford University), Makhtar Diop (World Bank's Vice President for Africa), and Donald Kaberuka (chairman of the African Development Bank) also sent some very strong messages to African CEOs by reminding them to promote Africa's private sector. Diop said: ""This CEO Forum reminds us that Africa needs its business leaders as never before -- to help it generate more electricity, grow more food, and create more jobs to keep growing strongly, while also improving people's well-being through less poverty, better health and education, and more hope."" Read related: How 'Afropreneurs' will shape Africa's future . Despite the positive kick-off, the conference saw the presence of few women CEOs and panelists, which demonstrated the need to push African women into the board room. However, women like Rwandan Valentine Rugwabiza (WTO) and Wendy Luhabe from the Women Private Equity Fund, made their voices strongly heard. Lubabe stressed the need for challenging and removing bad leaders in politics and in our organizations. ""We must not allow nepotism and tribalism to exist in our organizations,"" she said. ""We must create a culture of performance not mediocrity."" She added: ""It is our responsibility as Africans to build a better business environment and create talent for our people."" Luhabe emphasized the importance of educating the youth, as they are the future of Africa, and of creating entrepreneurs and adding vocational training to employment policies and agendas. A recurring theme at the event was that Africa needs more champions -- the likes of Bob Collymore, CEO of Safaricom in Kenya, Thierry Tanoh, CEO of Ecobank and Tewolde Gebremariam, CEO of Ethiopian Airlines. The last two were respectively named African Company of the Year and African CEO of the Year at the Forum. This event was extremely timely, current and relevant. Timely, because Africa's growth has been consistent in the past decade -- almost 6% growth per year. The global crisis in Europe is not stopping Africa's growth. Read related: Marieme Jamme: Shaping Africa's tech revolution . Current, because the narratives about Africa need to change; we are witnessing great progress in the continent and this needs to be highlighted. Relevant, because African CEOs need a platform where they can share and learn from one another. Most of the African CEOs have never met before but share common problems. However, only time will tell what impact the event will have on the CEOs when they return home. Africa faces enormous problems. A conference in Geneva can only ever be one step towards solving them. Good governance and transparency are still a challenge in Africa. African CEOs need to implement good procurement systems to fight corruption and leaks. They must create a culture of performance and challenge mediocrity at its core. The forum was packed with journalists from all around the world including young African bloggers and journalists from France's biggest newsrooms. The question we are all asking ourselves now is how can we create, maintain and retain talent in Africa? As the Apps4africa 2012 competition team travels to find the next tech CEO in Africa, all these questions were left unanswered at the African CEO Forum. The forum failed to talk about the youth of Africa, the Diaspora, technology hubs, and the growth of micro-economic dynamism we are seeing today. It dramatically failed to address what development strategies African companies should employ to sustain and scale up their businesses. Twitter: 10 African tech voices to follow on Twitter . CEOs did not fail by any means to demonstrate that Africa is changing and growing despite all the negatives press. Their energy and enthusiasm were palpable. The continent is needed more than ever, they said, but I think African CEOs must start working together, trusting each other, thinking of implementing a regional integration package and finding a route for transferring solutions between African countries. They must have a common platform where they can continue to learn from each other and share ideas. This is currently lacking. Collaboration is imperative amongst the CEOs of Africa. After all, the only way their individual successes is to be measured and defined is how people's lives have changed, how many jobs are created, how many people get access to information, and how much their human resources have progressed. Let's be honest -- Africa still faces great challenges. Investors are still reluctant to invest -- there are huge barriers. Starting a business is not always straight forward in may countries in Africa, the business ecosystem is almost non existent in many countries, we still have electricity issues, getting funding to start a business is still challenging in most parts of Africa, people aren't trained enough to execute essentials jobs, degrees gained by most African are useless or have no purpose in the job markets. These entire impediments must be addressed. Change is imminent!

"(CNN) -- North Korea's state media released a ""detailed report"" Tuesday claiming that American journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee entered the country illegally in order to record material for a ""smear campaign"" against the reclusive communist state. Supporters rally for U.S. journalists Euna Lee and Laura Ling on June 4 in Seoul, South Korea. It added that the two women ""admitted that what they did were criminal acts ... prompted by the political motive to isolate and stifle the socialist system of the DPRK by faking up moving images aimed at falsifying its human rights performance and hurling slanders and calumnies at it."" Ling and Lee were sentenced this month to 12 years of hard labor in North Korea. They were arrested in March for ""having illegally trespassed into the border of the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as North Korea is officially known] and committed hostile acts against it for which they were tried."" South Korean President Lee Myung-bak urged North Korea to release the two journalists Tuesday in a joint appearance with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House. Obama did not mention them. Relations between North and South Korea are extremely tense.  Watch family members plead for women » . The reporters for California-based Current TV -- a media venture of former U.S. Vice President Al Gore -- were arrested while reporting on the border between North Korea and China. They were sentenced after a closed-door trial. ""The investigation proved that the intruders crossed the border and committed the crime for the purpose of making animation files to be used for an anti-DPRK smear campaign over its human rights issue,"" the Korean Central News Agency said Tuesday. The KCNA report said there were two unidentified men with Ling and Lee when they were arrested, but gave no further details. It did not say whether the men were arrested. In a joint statement June 8, the journalists' families said they were ""shocked and devastated"" by the trial and sentence and urged Pyongyang ""to show compassion and grant Laura and Euna clemency and allow them to return home to their families."" ""Laura and Euna are journalists who went to the China-North Korea border to do a job,"" they said. ""We don't know what really happened on March 17, but if they wandered across the border without permission, we apologize on their behalf and we are certain that they have also apologized."" The KCNA report Tuesday said they had ""covertly crossed the River Tuman"" into North Korea. In Washington, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters earlier this month the United States is seeking the immediate release of the two journalists on humanitarian grounds.

The families said Ling suffers from an unspecified ""serious medical condition"" and Lee has a 4-year-old daughter ""who is displaying signs of anguish over the absence of her mother."" ""We believe that the three months they have already spent under arrest with little communication with their families is long enough,"" they said. The United States has no diplomatic relations with North Korea, and Sweden represents U.S. interests there.

"(CNN) -- Months after a jury couldn't decide his fate, a Southern California teen has agreed to plead guilty for gunning down a gay classmate three years ago in their junior high classroom. In September, a judge declared a mistrial in the case of Brandon McInerney, now 17, after jurors said they were hopelessly deadlocked following a nine-week trial on whether he should be found guilty of manslaughter or murder. The next month, the Ventura County District Attorney's Office announced that McInerney would be retried on first-degree murder charges as an adult. McInerney also was tried as an adult in the first trial. The district attorney's office said Monday that, since then, it had ""carefully reviewed the jury's determination"" and talked with some jurors. It also engaged in talks with the victim's family, McInerney and his attorneys after which the relevant parties ""agreed upon a disposition that balances the unique facts of the case with the need to protect the public."" Specifically, McInerney pleaded guilty to killing Lawrence King ""under the penal code sections for both murder and voluntary manslaughter,"" as well as to using a firearm in that crime. He will serve 11 years for manslaughter and 10 years for the use of a firearm, according to the district attorney's office. His formal sentencing is set for December 19. ""He will serve the entire 21 years without time off for good behavior and will not receive time off his sentence for the three years and nine months he has spent in juvenile hall before sentencing,"" the prosecutor's office said, concluding that he'd then serve nearly 25 years total. Had he been convicted on all the new charges , McInerney would have faced a maximum sentence of 50 years to life in prison. His defense attorney, Scott Wippert, told CNN affiliate KABC he thought the sentence was ""appropriate ... given all of the circumstances and all the evidence that came out at trial."" ""Obviously, we've always been of the opinion that he should have been tried as a juvenile,"" Wippert said. ""But that aside, given that he's in adult court, I think that this sentence reflects the sentiments of the jury."" McInerney was 14 when he brought a handgun belonging to relatives to E.O. Green Junior High School in Oxnard, prosecutors said. He shot the 15-year-old King twice at point-blank range in the back of the head, while both were typing papers in a computer lab for their English class along with two dozen students and their teacher, authorities said. Friends said King, an eighth grader who lived in a group home called Casa Pacifica, was proud of being openly gay. He liked wearing jewelry and makeup to school and he often wore high-heeled boots with the school uniform. He asked his teachers to call him Leticia instead of Larry. Some students bullied him, pupils said. Other students said McInerney was also subject to some harassment because King had a crush on him and made it publicly known. The Ventura County district attorney's office on Monday acknowledged criticism about its decision to try McInerney as an adult. The office stood by its decision, saying the options ""available in the juvenile system were inadequate."" ""This (plea agreement) is based upon the unique facts and circumstances of this case, and we believe it is a just result that balances the age and maturity level of the defendant with public safety and the gravity of the crime,"" the office said. The victim's father, Greg King, described the plea agreement as ""bittersweet,"" saying he didn't think the sentence equated to the crime but understood the thinking behind the deal. ""I think they should have taken another shot at it, but I understand why they didn't,"" he told CNN affiliate KCAL. ""But we've been going this for ... years and at least there's some closure coming up.""","NEW: ""I understand why"" the plea deal was reached, the victim's father says .

"(CNN) -- The ongoing furor over U.S. Rep. Todd Akin's remarks on rape and pregnancy was largely ignored on the campaign trail Tuesday as candidates for president and vice president refocused their attention on the issues that have dominated the election for weeks: Medicare and the economy. Speaking at a community college in Reno, Nevada, President Barack Obama spoke about education, slamming his Republican rivals for not having a clear plan. ""This country has always made a commitment to put a good education within the reach of all who were willing to work for it. That's part of what made us an economic superpower,"" he said. ""We are going to make sure that America once again leads the world in educating our kids and training our workers."" ""We've come too far to turn back now,"" the president added. Paul Ryan, the Republican vice presidential candidate, spoke at a Pennsylvania steel plant in front of a sign reading ""We Did Build It,"" another reference to a now-familiar Republican line against Obama, who in July said that small businesses owed part of their success to government-provided services. ""We have this funny idea, Mitt and I, that if you encourage success you get more of it,"" Ryan said at Beaver Steel Services in Carnegie. ""It's a good thing. If you demonize success, if you resent success, you get less success and less prosperity, less jobs and less take home pay."" The attention on the economy came as Republican leaders were ramping up their calls for Akin, a Missouri congressman, to drop out of his race for the U.S. Senate after asserting that ""legitimate rape"" rarely resulted in pregnancy. Mitt Romney, who spent Tuesday fund-raising in Texas, characterized the remarks as ""deeply offensive"" and called on the Missouri lawmaker to step down. Akin allowed a state deadline to pass Tuesday, defiantly staying in the race to unseat Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. Akin defies calls to withdraw from Senate race . Ryan, who personally maintains an opposition to abortion in all cases except when the life of the mother is at risk, also distanced himself from Akin, echoing Romney's call for him to withdraw, and did not mention the Republican dust-up at his stop Tuesday. The Wisconsin congressman chose instead to wade back into a debate over Medicare, which has been at the forefront of the campaign since he became Romney's running mate. Ryan has proposed a plan in the House that would allow private insurers to compete with traditional Medicare on an exchange, a move Democrats say would amount to a ""gutting"" of the government-run health care program for senior citizens. Ryan and Romney have hit back, pointing out that the House plan, as well as Romney's own plan, would not affect seniors currently enrolled in Medicare. They also claim Obama cut funding for Medicare to pay for his sweeping health care law. Ryan continued using the attack line Tuesday, saying Obama ""treated Medicare like a piggybank to pay for Obamacare and his campaign called that an achievement."" Vice President Joe Biden, campaigning in Minnesota, pushed back hard on Ryan's claim, saying the law put in place by Obama strengthened Medicare without ""cutting a penny."" ""We extended the life of Medicare by eight years,"" Biden said. ""The very thing Romney wants to eliminate now. Saving millions of seniors hundreds of dollars a year on their prescription drugs, allowing them to go to preventative care."" Biden framed the upcoming election as a ""make or break moment for the middle class,"" and took a shot at Romney for not standing by some of his claims. ""I don't have to talk about the character or conviction of the president compared to his rival,"" Biden said. ""Presidential elections come down to character, and the conviction of your character. The American public knowing that what you say, you mean. That you stand by what you said you would do."" He also took aim at Republican economic policies in general, arguing they offer nothing new. ""There's overwhelming evidence that their policies will not grow the economy. It didn't do it before and it won't now. Folks, we've seen this movie before. And we know, we know how it ends,"" the vice president said. Romney, in remarks at a fund-raiser in Houston, took a jab at Obama's campaign one day after financial filings revealed the president's re-election team had spent more money than it raised in July. ""We're a little wiser in our spending of dollars than the other side, apparently,"" Romney said, according to pool reports. ""I'm not managing their campaign for them, but we're going to spend our money wisely. We're going to spend it to win."" Money gap between Romney, Obama grows . In Ohio, where he appeared earlier, Obama sharply rebuffed his Republican rivals, saying their economic plans -- specifically Romney's suggestion that students struggling to pay for college borrow money from their parents -- unfairly benefited the wealthy. ""That's not an answer,"" Obama said. ""There is nothing a parent wants more than to give our kids opportunities we never had. And there are few things as painful as not being able to do that."" ""I do not accept the notion that we should deny their children the opportunity of a higher education and a brighter future just because their families were hit hard by the recession,"" the president continued. Romney's campaign fired back, saying the president's own record on higher education was nothing to brag about. ""Under this president, too many young Americans are suffering from higher college costs, more debt, and a lack of good jobs when they graduate,"" Amanda Henneberg, a Romney campaign spokeswoman, wrote in a statement. ""Today's policies are just more of the same from a president who hasn't fixed the economy or kept his promises to the young people who supported him four years ago.""

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A camp housing a group of Iranian dissidents in Iraq was attacked Saturday, leaving at least two people dead and 27 wounded, a spokesman for the group said. The rocket attack occurred on the outskirts of Baghdad at Camp Hurriya, a former U.S. base known as Camp Liberty, now the home of the Iranian exile group Mujahedin-e-Khalq. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, which the group, also known as the MEK, says damaged a number of the camp's facilities. Saturday's incident is the camp's third rocket attack since February 9, when eight residents were killed and 100 wounded, according to Shahin Gobadi, a spokesman for the National Council of Resistance of Iran. The United States condemned the attack and called on the Iraqi government to provide immediate medical aid to the victims and ensure the safety of the camp's residents. ""We've also called on the government of Iraq to investigate this attack and bring the terrorists responsible to justice,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement released Saturday. The MEK fought alongside Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's troops during the Iran-Iraq war. Relations between Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Shiite-dominated government and the MEK have been tense since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Hussein and his Sunni government. The group, once considered a terror organization by the United States, was removed from a State Department terror list in September, following a decision by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The MEK moved to Camp Hurriya last year from its longtime home at Camp Ashraf in Diyala province, a temporary measure before members are resettled in third countries. The United States has been working with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees on the resettlement project. CNN's Tom Dunlavey contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. condemns the attack, calls on Iraq to give immediate medical help and investigate .

"(CNN) -- Running has always been an enigma to me. It seems so simple: Lace up your sneakers, crank up the music and head out the door. It comes so easy to some people, but it never has to me. Growing up, I tried to be a runner. At an early age, I was diagnosed with exercise-induced asthma. This is an inflammation and constriction of the bronchi in the lungs that occurs after a few minutes of strenuous or aerobic activity. I was prescribed various inhalers to control the condition, and they seemed to decrease the asthma, but it never completely stopped. It was annoying, it was embarrassing, and it caused me to avoid most exercises, especially running. It was an excuse. I am not a runner ... Make your workout go by faster . I decided to start playing tennis in middle school. While I always had great bursts of speed on the court, the off-season running workouts killed me. Still, I could control my asthma, and my tennis skills slowly improved. Then my next nemesis arrived. I discovered a nasty pain called shin splints, from pounding those hard courts day after day. This condition is also called medial tibial stress syndrome and is caused by a combination of factors that put stress on the lower leg, causing some very uncomfortable pain in my shins and cramping in my calves when running. The pain, or rather the threat of the pain, kept me from running long distances, so I stopped. It was an excuse. I am not a runner ... Fast-forward to later in life. I wanted to try to run again. After some research and a visit to my local running shop, I discovered a compression strap for my calf that could help my shin splints, and it worked! T-shirt tales: The athlete I used to be . So off to run I went. All was going great: I was gaining endurance while managing to control the asthma and the shin splints. Then I started to get a sharp pain just in front of my heel on the bottom of my foot. This pain occurred right after my running workouts, and it was even worse the next morning. My doctor diagnosed me with plantar fasciitis in my left foot. This is an incredibly painful inflammation of the connective tissue (the plantar fascia) that stretches from your heel to your toes. With this pain, I had found my newest nemesis. I tried to run through the pain, but even walking during the day became painful, so I stopped running altogether. There are many treatments for helping manage this pain, from special socks that stretch the tissue to cortisone injections that help the inflammation. I found an orthotic shoe insert that helped to stretch the plantar fascia, and slowly, the pain went away. 'Too fat to do a lot of things' But once again, the threat of pain kept me from running. It was an excuse. I am not a runner ... Fast-forward to today. I've developed a love of endurance sports and an admiration for the amazing athletes who compete in them, from runners to cyclists to triathletes. I've always wanted to participate, but the fear of pain or asthma has always kept me on the sidelines. I know that my pain is manageable and my fear is irrational. I want to run. Getting fit for the family I love . As I've started training for the Nautica Malibu Triathlon, I constantly think of my CNN Fit Nation teammates, many of whom have conquered their own obstacles, much more serious than the pain that has stopped me. We all have hurdles in life, some great and some small, that try to prevent us from doing the things we want to do. My mantra had become ""I am not a runner,"" but it was just an excuse. This excuse no longer stops me. My minor injuries and pains are nothing compared with the hardships many people face every day. My pain and anxiety are manageable, and I am no longer afraid. Perspective is a wonderful thing, and when I think of all of the amazing people in my life who have overcome much larger hurdles than those that have stopped me in the past, I am motivated. I keep moving, knowing that if they can overcome their obstacles, I can overcome mine. My running workouts aren't breaking any endurance records, and I don't move that fast, but I keep moving. I lace up my sneakers and crank up my music, and I keep running because my pain is temporary. I am not a runner ... YET!

"(CNN) -- The Pentagon is fighting a push to award the Purple Heart to victims of the 2009 massacre at Fort Hood, Texas, fearing it could hurt the case against the Army officer charged with turning on his comrades. ""If you deal with the perpetrator of these crimes, he was a terrorist, essentially,"" one of the bill's co-sponsors, Texas Republican Rep. Bill Flores, told CNN affiliate KXXV. ""We ought to treat these military men and women that were hurt like they were in a battlefield theater."" Maj. Nidal Hasan is awaiting a court-martial on charges that he gunned down 13 people and wounded 32 at Fort Hood, the country's largest Army post. Testimony is set to begin on July 1. But in a position paper obtained by CNN, the Defense Department argues that awarding the Purple Heart to the Fort Hood victims would make it harder to convict Hasan in the death-penalty case and ""deprive the victims of these crimes the right to see justice done."" ""Defense counsel will argue that Major Hasan cannot receive a fair trial because a branch of government has indirectly declared that Major Hasan is a terrorist -- that he is criminally culpable,"" the document states. That could lead to a delay of the case or the reversal of a guilty verdict on appeal, it continued. ""This laudable sentiment mistakenly and unwillingly supplants the criminal trial process by infusing official, formal statutory conclusions about the motive, intent and culpability of the man charged with the crime,"" the memo reads. Prosecutors aim to show that the Hasan, an American citizen of Palestinian descent, was a radical Islamist. Witnesses reported that Hasan opened fire with two pistols, yelling ""Allahu akbar"" -- Arabic for ""God is great"" -- as he shot troops preparing to deploy to Afghanistan. Investigations have found that he had been communicating via e-mail with radical Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed by a U.S. drone attack in 2011. Hasan had been scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan before the killings but had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military. The bill has the support of former House Speaker and GOP presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich, who dismissed the Defense Department's concerns about a fair trial in an interview on CNN's The Situation Room. ""Does anybody doubt he was in the room? Does anyone doubt he yelled 'Allahu akbar?' Does anyone doubt he shot all those people?"" Gingrich asked. ""We have a lawyer-driven system that is sick."" Gingrich said the military has ""bent over backwards"" to avoid declaring the killings an act of terrorism. By comparison, he said, German spies caught during World War II were tried and executed ""in a matter of weeks."" ""There is no question this man is guilty. None. Zero,"" he said. Pentagon spokesman George Little declined to comment Monday, citing the pending case. But a congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the legal concerns, called the military's position ""dead wrong."" ""If they stand by this, they should ask for all the Pentagon's 9/11 award recipients to give their medals back,"" the source said. ""They're not gonna do that, though."" The Pentagon document notes that victims of an international terrorist attack are eligible for the Purple Heart. But expanding that to include domestic crimes or terrorism, it asserts, ""would be a dramatic departure from the traditional Purple Heart award criteria."" ""Ultimately, such an unprecedented action would thwart the real and lasting measure that will bring closure to the grieving and harmed victims and families -- the trial itself,"" the position paper states. However, the bill Flores co-sponsored states that the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee branded the Fort Hood killings a ""terrorist attack"" in a 2011 report. ""It basically just says if you were shot at Fort Hood that day or you were shot in Afghanistan, you're treated exactly the same,"" Flores said.","NEW: ""There is no question this man is guilty,"" Gingrich says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The most lucrative match in world football took place at Wembley Stadium on Monday -- with Burnley defeating Sheffield United 1-0 to collect a prize which is estimated to be worth nearly $100 million -- more than any Superbowl or World Cup final. $100m smiles? Hull City players celebrate after winning last year's Championship play-off match. In fact, international accountancy firm Deloitte say the English Championship play-off final is the richest single game in any sport. The financial jackpot for Burnley includes a $53m payment towards the coming season, and a minimum of $18m in each of the following two seasons. Dan Jones, partner in the Sport Business group at accountancy firm Deloitte, told CNN the difference between the $100m reward for the winner and what the loser receives is larger than in any other single event of any sport. ""I can't think of a bigger one. People started talking about the Twenty20 for $20m cricket match when it came out -- but this is much bigger,"" he said. The massive injection of money to the victor is largely due to the lucrative television rights deals for Premier League football matches. Earlier this year the Premier League secured a new set of television deals for the 2010-2013 seasons worth a record $2.70 billion (£1.782b). The financial comparison between this match and the Champions League final -- which will be contested between Manchester United and FC Barcelona -- is remarkable. While a 2008 study funded by MasterCard found that the winner of the Champions League could earn as much as $149m (€110m), Jones said the financial difference between winning an losing the final would be only around $6m. ""In terms of financial pressure -- if a player from Sheffield or Burnley steps up to take a penalty in that match -- they have a lot more riding on it than anyone in the Champions League would,"" he said. There is also potential for the guaranteed $100m to get even sweeter for the victor. Jones told CNN that in addition to the direct pay-out benefits, most clubs also experience greater ticket-sales and can attract higher advertising and sponsorship revenue. A club which managed to avoid relegation from the Premier League in the next season could gain a total of more than $100m as a result of winning the match. A club that did drop back down would still receive the ""parachute payment"" of $18m for two further seasons, Jones said. It's not an easy road for the team that wins this match, however. Of all the play-off match winners in the last decade, only three -- Bolton, West Ham and Hull City -- remain in the top flight. Last year's winner, Hull City, sit on the brink of relegation this weekend, and the challenge they face to stay up is the same one either Burnley or Sheffield United will get to face next season: global giant Manchester United before 80,000 people at Old Trafford. Good luck.","English football's Championship play-off final is the richest game of any sport .

"(CNN) -- Everyone agrees that we don't want criminals to get guns. And in the debate over gun control, the vast majority of the public also agrees that requiring background checks for all gun transactions -- even private sales at gun shows or between acquaintances -- would achieve this end. The National Rifle Association and its allies oppose this idea because they believe a federal background check requirement will lead to gun registration. This, they argue, is a violation of the privacy of gun owners and could one day help the government confiscate all guns. We believe it is possible to have an effective background-check system in the United States for all gun transactions without requiring gun registration. There is no intrinsic tradeoff here between privacy and public safety. Opinion: Why the NRA fights background checks . Why do we need a universal background check requirement? Right now, federal law requires background checks only for gun sales made by licensed federal firearms dealers (FFLs), not private parties. Most gun sales involve a licensed dealer, but not when criminals are the buyers. Surveys of inmates in jail or prison regularly show that 80% to 90% got their crime guns from a family member, acquaintance or ""the street"" -- transactions for which federal law does not require a background check. That's the mother of all loopholes. Requiring background checks for non-FFL sales in the secondary market can make it harder for criminals to get guns. Disconnect on background checks . Someone with a gun to sell could avoid any liability by paying a small fee to a licensed dealer to conduct the background check on the buyer. (In California, which has had this system in place since 1991, the fee is $10.) If the buyer happened to be a felon or a fugitive, then the licensed dealer would be required to block the sale. Those who oppose requiring a universal background check worry the only way the government would be able to enforce such a law would be by requiring all gun owners to register their guns with the government. But that view reflects a lack of imagination. There are other possibilities. Would background checks have stopped recent mass shootings? For one thing, the licensed federal firearms dealer who presides over a private sale could be required to report the transaction to the state without giving the name of the buyer. Each state could then keep a database of gun transfers, including the serial number of the gun and the identity of the seller. That database would not be a registry because it would not identify any current owners. But it would facilitate police investigations. Another possibility would not require any reporting on the part of the licensed dealer. Instead, gun owners themselves would be required to keep documentation on any transactions in which one of their guns was transferred to another person. That documentation could then help the police trace a gun through the chain of possession from first retail sale by a licensed dealer. If the gun were associated with a crime or a criminal, then police investigators might require previous owners to provide that documentation. Under this scheme, the vast majority of private sales would never be subject to investigation or even known to the authorities. But the police could do what they need to do to investigate gun crimes and to provide gun owners with an incentive to do background checks. Background checks: How do they work? Illinois already has a system similar to this in place; private citizens who resell their guns have to check to make sure that the other party has passed a background check and received a firearm owners identification card from the state police. They are also required to keep a record of the sale and to whom they sold their gun for 10 years. Interestingly, the NRA website says that it does not consider this aspect of Illinois state law as requiring ""registration of firearms."" We could all spend a lot of time and energy in the next few weeks arguing about the likelihood the federal government will ever try to take our guns or how to weigh the privacy of gun owners versus the need to reduce the carnage that takes place on our nation's city streets (and, as current events remind us, sometimes in our movie theaters and elementary schools as well). Or perhaps the best option, given what's at stake, is for us to find a creative compromise that would serve the immediate purpose of reducing gun violence without registration.

"(CNN) -- Porto have been sanctioned by UEFA for the ""racist conduct"" of their supporters during a Europa League last 32 game against Manchester City on their home ground in February. The Portuguese club were fined 20,000 euros ($26,344) Wednesday by European football's governing body and have been given three days to appeal the punishment, a statement on UEFA official website said. City, who won the match 2-1 at the Estadio do Dragao, complained after Yaya Toure and Mario Balotelli were the target of racist chants. These intensified when Italian international Balotelli was substituted with 12 minutes to go. Porto coach Vitor Pereira later claimed there the fans were actually chanting, ""Hulk, Hulk, Hulk"" at his club's star player, but these arguments were rejected by UEFA. Porto were beaten 4-0 in the second leg at the Etihad Stadium and reported City fans to UEFA, claiming they had made ""improper"" chants at Hulk. But UEFA took no action against City, who were knocked out of the competition by another Portuguese side, Sporting Lisbon, in the last 16.","Porto fined $26,344 for 'racist conduct' by their fans in Europa League tie .

"(CNN) -- Soccer star Lionel Messi has denied allegations of wrongdoing after being accused of defrauding the Spanish authorities of over $5 million. According to court papers seen by CNN, prosecutors say the Barcelona player and his father Jorge Horacio are suspected of filing fraudulent tax returns between 2006-2009. The four-time World Player of the Year, who is away on international duty with Argentina, took to Facebook Wednesday to offer a firm rebuttal of the accusation. ""We have just known through the media about the claim filed by the Spanish tax authorities,"" read a statement in Spanish and English. ""We are surprised about the news, because we have never committed any infringement. ""We have always fulfilled all our tax obligations, following the advice of our tax consultants, who will take care of clarifying this situation."" According to the papers filed by the prosecutor, Raquel Amado in Gava, the seaside resort close to Barcelona where Messi lives, it is alleged that they tried to avoid paying taxes in Spain by selling the player's image rights through overseas companies. Messi, who will turn 26 later this month, is one of the world's highest-paid athletes according to Forbes Magazine. He has a yearly salary from Barcelona of just over $20 million plus around $21 million in endorsements from several lucrative sponsors including Adidas and PepsiCo, putting him 10th on Forbes' list. Messi, who arrived at Barcelona as a 13-year-old in 2000, has won six Primera Liga titles, three Champions League crowns and scored an unparalleled 86 goals for club and country in 2012. Barcelona refused to comment on the story when asked by CNN. Meanwhile, Messi played just 30 minutes of Argentina's World Cup qualifying tie against Ecuador in Quito on Tuesday, which ended in a 1-1 draw.. Argentina finished the game with 10 men after captain Javier Mascherano kicked out at the driver of the medical cart in an apparent response to being driven too quickly. The 29-year-old was being carried from the field with just four minutes remaining before the clash, which led to referee Enrique Caceres showing him a red card. The Barcelona player later apologized on Twitter, saying: ""I really apologize for the reaction I had, nothing justifies this."" Argentina leads the South American qualifying section on 26 points, three ahead of Colombia and five clear of Ecuador. The country's domestic league has been thrown into turmoil after a fan died before a match on Monday, being reportedly shot by a police officer after fighting broke out. That incident in La Plata, which led to the match between Lanus and Estudiantes being suspended at halftime, came just days after another league game was called off due to fan violence. The Argentine Football Association has responded by ruling that away fans cannot attend any of the next two rounds of matches, as the season comes to a close.","Lionel Messi and father under investigation by Spanish tax authorities .

"(CNN) -- November 6, 2008, 9:06 a.m.: Ernie Casillas can peg the downward spiral of his life to that exact minute, when he was fired from his job as a mortgage broker. Barack Obama had just been elected president as Casillas was leaving the work force. Nearly four years later, as Obama seeks reelection, Casillas has finally landed his first full-time job, emerging out of the group known as the long-term unemployed. The Labor Department's July employment figures on Friday showed the average duration of unemployment shrank from 39.9 weeks in June to 38.8 weeks in July. The percentage of people who are unemployed long-term (27 weeks or longer) shrank from 41.9% in June to 40.7% in July. Casillas says his life is evidence that the economy is beginning to turn around. But the road to his new job was painful, heartbreaking and financially devastating. July jobs report: Hiring picks up, unemployment rises . He remembers his life pre-November 2008: He wore expensive suits, drove a Mercedes and spent every cent of his paycheck. When he was laid off, he thought he'd be back at work in two weeks. He was wrong. The subprime mortgage crisis was eating away at the U.S. economy. Employers were shedding jobs, not adding them. A few credits shy of his associate degree, Casillas found himself overqualified for many jobs but underqualified for higher-paid middle-class ones. ""Overqualified, what does that mean?"" Casillas remembers. ""They kept telling me that. Meanwhile, my life is going down the drain."" He lost his house, his Mercedes, and then his wife left him. In his 40s, he was forced to take the humiliating step of moving in with his mother. A year after he lost his job, he began selling everything he owned on Craigslist. Obama closer to breaking even on jobs . Then Casillas decided to go even further. He placed an ad on Craigslist that read, ""Unemployed. I need a job."" ""I wasn't this rich yuppie anymore,"" he says. ""Driving expensive cars, having expensive suits. It humbles you. This is real."" Casillas continued to send out résumés and network at job fairs. But hundreds of résumés later, he still had no job. He started his own computer consulting company, hoping to parlay his IT knowledge into a paycheck. But in a sinking economy, few small businesses wanted to take a chance on a new entrepreneur. Last year, he tried a new route: bluntly hitting the Los Angeles financial district with a large sign that read, ""IT job needed."" Wearing a suit and clean-shaven, Casillas looked no different from the people walking around him at lunchtime. ""I think there's a lot of us walking here who are not that far away from where you are,"" said a man on his lunch hour. ""Yep,"" said Casillas, shaking his head in acknowledgement. Casillas shook hands and traded business cards, but again, no job. Why this month's good jobs news won't last . Last month, all of Casillas' networking finally paid off when he crossed paths with Anna Rosales, the CEO of Avor Inc. Rosales listened as Casillas recounted his frustrating years on the job trail. The story resonated with Rosales, who had been unemployed herself. She hired Casillas as a supervisor in her green cleaning company, despite his lack of experience in the cleaning field. ""He deserves it. Everyone deserves to work,"" Rosales says. Casillas would do well, she believed, because of his upbeat personality and his never-will-quit attitude. ""Have you ever been unemployed? Ever not able to pay a bill? There's a whole lot of Ernies out there."" Friday's Labor Department figures say there are 2.5 million long-term unemployed people like Ernie Casillas. While the figure is high, it is an improvement from the month before. Despite Casillas' painful four-year journey, he says he will still vote for the man who came into office as Casillas was exiting his mortgage career. ""I would definitely vote for him,"" says Casillas, saying he blames former President George W. Bush for the state of today's economy. He also says Obama is less distasteful than his opponent. ""I don't think he's with the people. Mitt Romney doesn't understand a guy like me, someone who's cleaning and sweeping. He's the guy we clean for."" Casillas says he's learned many lessons from his jobless four years, beginning with learning to save. He plans to save half of his paycheck, just in case he loses his job. He also says people need to be flexible when seeking a job, pointing out that he never imagined working at a cleaning company. What he also never imagined is that his new job would pay more than a career as a mortgage banker. He is piecing his life together and looking forward to his first paycheck next week. He's also moved out of his mother's house and in with his girlfriend. Casillas adds that he's become a better person and less materialistic. ""I no longer think I'm better than the cleaning crew. I am the cleaning crew. So I feel that it made me a better man."" But when asked if he would ever choose to go through his journey again, he quickly responds, ""No. No. No.""","In 2008, Ernie Casillas wore pricey suits, drove a Mercedes and spent without saving .

"(CNN) -- When Jupp Heynckes made his debut in the Bundesliga as a player back in 1965, the name of Bayern Munich was a new one for the nascent German soccer league. Now as coach of the country's most successful team, he has reached a significant milestone in what will be his final season in charge. On Saturday the 67-year-old became only the second man to rack up 1,000 Bundesliga appearances as both player and coach as Bayern took another step towards a 23rd national title with a 6-1 thrashing of Werder Bremen in front of 71,000 fans at Allianz Arena. It was Heynckes' 631st Bundesliga game as a head coach, coming 48 years after he played his first match for hometown club Borussia Monchengladbach on the day that Bayern made a Bundesliga bow against city rival 1860 Munich. ""It's an imposing total,"" said Heynckes, who is behind only former Greece coach Otto Rehgal's 1,033 Bundesliga matches -- 201 of which were as a player. Heynckes is on course for a treble of trophies, with Bayern poised to reach the quarterfinals of the Champions League after the 3-1 midweek win at Arsenal, having suffered an agonizing penalty shootout defeat by Chelsea in last season's title match despite home advantage. He rested six key players ahead of Wednesday's German Cup clash with two-time defending Bundesliga champions Borussia Dortmund, but still had too much firepower as Bremen had a man sent off at 2-0 down and never recovered. Mario Gomez netted twice in the second half to reach his 100th goal in a red shirt, having earlier forced Czech international Gebre Selassie into diverting a cross into his own net. Before that the Germany striker was brought down by Sebastian Prodl as Bremen went to the interval a man down. Javi Martinez, Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery were also on the scoresheet. ""After making those six changes, we needed 20 minutes to find our rhythm,"" said Heynckes, who will step down at the end of this season and be replaced by former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola. ""Those players who came in justified my confidence in them. The game on Wednesday will be a real cup battle."" However, he was annoyed that Bayern conceded in the league for the first time since the December 14 draw with Monchengladbach. ""We saw some nice goals out there, but we didn't reckon with conceding one."" Second-placed Dortmund will seek to cut the 18-point deficit at Gladbach on Sunday, when third-placed Bayer Leverkusen travel to bottom team Greuther Furth. In Saturday's other games, sixth-placed Hamburg crashed 5-1 at fellow European hopefuls Hanover, while Schalke followed up the midweek Champions League draw against Galatasaray by beating Fortuna Dusseldorf as Cameroon defender Joel Matip scored twice. Mainz drew 1-1 with fourth-bottom Wolfsburg, while Augsburg pushed Hoffenheim down to second from the foot of the table with a 2-1 win.","Bayern Munich boss becomes second man to reach 1,000 Bundesliga games .

"(CNN) -- As fierce fires continue to rage uncontained, tens of thousands of residents in Colorado are displaced from their homes. Many of them will never be able to return. Fire has devoured their houses. The number of destroyed homes is well into the hundreds and the fire continues to spread. CNN is reporting this is the most destructive fire in Colorado's history. It is clear that the people of Colorado will need help and that the need will grow until the fire is contained. However, as conditions are unsafe, it is not recommended to go to the affected areas or offer volunteer help. At this time, the best way to help is through donations. State government officials say that the arrival of volunteers at this time would impede the response efforts but that volunteers will be needed during the recovery phase. They ask for those wishing to volunteer be patient and be trained by reputable relief agencies. For more guidance from state officials, check the Help Colorado Now website. But as the situation continues to develop there are organizations already established on the ground and helping those in need. You can help their efforts by making a donation to any one of the following groups. American Red Cross . Hundreds of families and individuals have turned to the Red Cross for shelter from the Black Forest fire near Colorado Springs and the Royal Gorge Fire near CaÃ±on City. They are working with other local organizations to provide food as well. Red Cross employees are meeting with affected residents, assessing their needs, and providing comfort kits and stuffed animals to children. Experts are also standing by to provide preparedness and evacuation information for residents who have not yet had to leave their homes. The Salvation Army . The Salvation Army of Pike's Peak is on the scene providing food and refreshments to evacuees and first responders. While most organizations prefer you make financial donations, The Salvation Army has also placed a call on its Facebook page asking that donations of sports drinks to help the firefighters combating the fire be sent to: . 908 Yuma Street Colorado Springs, Colorado 80909 . Long-term help . After last year's devastating fires, two long-term funds were established. The Long-Term Recovery Group of Northern Colorado Fund comprises more than 50 nonprofit agencies, government organizations, faith-based groups and concerned citizens. This fund was established to provide long-term care for those affected by the 2012 wildfires and subsequent flooding in Larimer County. The United Way of Larimer County is overseeing this fund. The second is the Pikes Peak Region Long-Term Recovery Group. It aims to provide recovery services to individuals and families affected by the Waldo Canyon Fire in the Pikes Peak Region. This fund provides long-term aid and resources in the following categories: case management and unmet needs, emotional and spiritual care, housing, material donation coordination and construction and clean-up.","Tens of thousands of people are displaced due to raging wildfires in two areas of Colorado .

"(CNN) -- Adam Mayes -- accused of murder and kidnapping in a case involving a Tennessee mother and her three daughters -- has died, FBI spokesman Joel Siskovic said late Thursday. The two sisters he allegedly kidnapped were found alive, law enforcement sources said. There had been conflicting reports about whether Mayes was dead or alive after he reportedly shot himself in Union County, Mississippi. Daniel McMullen, FBI special agent in charge in Jackson, Mississippi, said that officers with the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol and state Department of Fisheries, Wildlife and Parks rescued Alexandria and Kyliyah Bain, ""alive and unharmed."" ""Preliminary reports indicate that Mr. Mayes shot himself in the head and was later pronounced dead,"" McMullen told reporters. The two surviving sisters ""are suffering from the experience of being out in the woods and from being kidnapped. They are suffering from dehydration and exhaustion, but appear OK,"" a federal law enforcement source on the scene told CNN. Mayes, 35, was suspected of abducting Alexandria, 12, and Kyliyah, 8, from their Whiteville, Tennessee, home, in late April, and killing Jo Ann Bain and her eldest daughter, Adrienne, 14. The FBI on Wednesday put Adam Mayes on its list of 10 most wanted fugitives. The reward for information leading to Mayes' arrest stood at $175,000 on Thursday. Authorities responded Thursday evening after someone called to report what they believed may have been Mayes' vehicle, a law enforcement source close to the investigation said. A task force was nearby and as they approached, Mayes stood up and shot himself in the head, the source said. The two girls were not near him at the time. Mayes and his wife, Teresa Mayes, had been charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of especially aggravated kidnapping. He faced an additional count of making a false report, according to arrest affidavits filed in Tennessee. Adam Mayes' mother-in-law told HLN's Nancy Grace on Thursday that he may have believed he was the father of the two young girls he was accused of abducting. ""He believes they are his children,"" Josie Tate told Grace. Tate, who lives in Chatsworth, Georgia, tearfully pleaded for Mayes to return Alexandria and Kyliyah Bain and turn himself in. ""You've had a chance to live life. They haven't,"" Tate said. ""Give them that chance."" Police said Teresa Mayes told them she was in the Bains' garage when Adam Mayes killed Jo Ann and Adrienne Bain. Teresa Mayes' lawyer, Shana Johnson, said Thursday that her client last saw Mayes and the Bain girls in Mississippi on April 27. The Mayes family and the Bain family are connected through Adam Mayes' sister Pamela, who used to be married to Jo Ann's husband, Gary Bain, the lawyer said. Johnson told HLN she was ""happy"" and ""relieved"" the girls had been found alive. In affidavits, investigators said the Mayeses drove the bodies of Jo Ann and Adrienne Bain to Union County in northern Mississippi, where they were discovered Saturday in a shallow grave behind the house of Adam Mayes' mother in Guntown, Mississippi. Adam Mayes' mother, Mary Frances Mayes, has been charged with four counts of conspiracy to commit especially aggravated kidnapping. Adam Mayes was last seen May 1 in Guntown. While the search was centered around his hometown, he also had connections to Arizona, Texas, Florida and the Carolinas, the FBI said. Bobbi Booth, Mayes' sister-in-law, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday night that she's ""overwhelmed right now."" ""All I'm (thinking) about now is that the children are safe,"" said Booth. ""Thank you, God, for letting those children come home."" Booth described Adam Mayes as ""aggressive, abusive, crazy obviously."" But Booth said she never had an inkling Mayes would be accused of kidnapping and murder. ""I never dreamed that he would do this,"" she said. CNN's Rich Phillips and Joe Sutton, and HLN's Natisha Lance, Mike Brooks and Josey Crews contributed to this report.","Reports indicate Adam Mayes shot himself in head, FBI says .

"(CNN) -- Savita Halappanavar died last month in Ireland after being denied a lifesaving abortion. If she had lived in the United States -- where in two months we will mark four decades of safe and legal abortion on the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade ruling -- she likely would be alive today. I was a little girl when this decision overturned state bans across the country that prevented women from access to medically safe procedures. Unlike my mother's generation -- when women often died from self-induced abortions or back-alley abortions performed by a person with no skills or training, often under unsanitary conditions -- my siblings, friends, classmates and I grew up with the ability to make informed decisions when faced with an unintended or medically problematic pregnancy. Worldwide, many women are unable to make personal health decisions. The consequences are grave. According to a World Health Organization report, about 47,000 women die each year around the world from unsafe abortions. This accounts for about 13% of all maternal deaths. Most of these women die in developing countries, where severe legal restrictions and lack of access to modern medical care drive women to seek unsafe procedures. By contrast, abortion in the United States is incredibly safe: Fewer than 0.3% of women experience complications that require hospitalization. But Halappanavar died in a highly developed country. After 17 weeks of pregnancy, she went to the hospital, miscarrying and in extreme pain. Her husband says doctors denied requests for an abortion to save her life; after three days the fetus died, and after suffering for four days, Savita Halappanavar died of blood poisoning. Her death in Ireland serves as a stark reminder that living in a developed country does not necessarily protect us from backward health policies. Lawmakers in Ireland who defend that country's near-total ban on abortion rely on the same politically driven arguments echoed across much of the U.S. by opponents of women's freedom to choose, as they try to chip away at access to safe and legal abortion. In Ohio, for example, legislators are considering a bill that would ban abortion early in pregnancy, even before some women know they are pregnant. According to an analysis from the Guttmacher Institute, half the women in our nation live in states hostile to abortion access; and in 2011 alone, states enacted a record 92 provisions seeking to restrict women's access to abortion. This is not the legacy I wish for my children. I want my son and daughter to grow up in a country where they make their own health care decisions and their privacy is respected. Unless we stand up to these attacks on women's health and personal decision making, we are sure to hear more stories like Halappanavar's -- and this time closer to home. Senseless decisions do not just happen in other countries. In Nebraska, doctors refused to allow Danielle Deaver to end her pregnancy after she learned her daughter would not survive, citing the state's ban on abortion past 20 weeks gestation. Instead, Deaver was forced to deliver an infant who died moments after birth. Evidence shows time and again that banning abortion does not make it go away -- it merely leads to more unsafe abortions and more women dying. Some of the countries with the highest abortion rates worldwide have the most restrictive policies. On the other hand, countries with the lowest abortion rates tend to have more supportive abortion policies and strong policy support for contraception. Policymakers truly interested in reducing abortion should support strong investment in contraception at home and abroad. Under the Affordable Care Act, millions more Americans will be eligible for birth control coverage without a co-pay â€” which will have a tremendous impact for women across the country who find it a struggle to use contraception consistently because of its cost. The U.S. is the largest investor in global family planning and HIV/AIDS programs in the world. We need to protect these investments from budget cuts to ensure that women everywhere can plan and space their children's births and prevent unintended pregnancy and disease. As the United Nations recently declared, access to contraception is a universal human right. We also need to fight for better access to safe and legal abortion at home and abroad. As Halappanavar's case devastatingly demonstrates, even during a planned pregnancy, a woman must sometimes consider an abortion. The difficult decision to end a pregnancy, to choose adoption or to raise a child should be up to the woman, in consultation with her family, her faith and her doctor. On January 22, when my family honors the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I want to be able to tell my children that our country is moving forward, not turning back the clocks. We will remember Savita Halappanavar on that day and repeat the mantra echoed at vigils in Ireland and around the world honoring her wholly preventable death: Never again.

"(CNN) -- Three men have come forward to say they were sexually abused by convicted former Penn State assistant coach Jerry Sandusky as early as the 1970s, sources close to the case told a Pennsylvania newspaper. Sandusky was convicted in June of sexually abusing 10 boys in cases dating back to the 1990s. Two sources with knowledge of the investigation said police are aware these men have come forward, and one has already contacted investigators, the Harrisburg Patriot-News reported Monday. Their allegations are the first to accuse Sandusky of molesting boys before the 1990s, when the cases prosecutors brought against him took place. If found credible, they would directly attack the 68-year-old's defense argument that a person doesn't become pedophile in his or her 50s. In the early 1970s, when one of the men says he was abused, Jerry Sandusky would have been in his late 20s. More storms looming for Penn State . Sandusky could face hundreds of years behind bars at his sentencing on 45 counts in September. As his jury was deliberating, more accusers -- including his own adopted son -- raised allegations of abuse. The grand jury investigation that led to Sandusky's November arrest is still meeting and could be hearing from more potential victims, but the Pennsylvania attorney general's office has not said if more charges will be filed. Nils Frederiksen, a spokesman for the agency, said he couldn't discuss ""any specific evidence"" because of the grand jury probe. ""Court filings have indicated that new information has come forward and we're continuing to pursue, but can't talk about specific evidence."" The woman who stood up to Joe Paterno . Lt. Mark Argiro of the State College Police Department said that he is ""unaware of any investigations"" of new allegations towards Sandusky, while Sandusky's lawyer did not respond to a request for comment from CNN. It was not known whether the new accusers were contacted or interviewed by the team led by former FBI Director Louis Freeh, who delivered a scathing internal review of Penn State's handling of the case last week. Freeh's report does not mention any victims before the 1990s, and when asked Thursday whether he looked for anyone molested before that period, he simply responded, ""Yes."" He did not say what his investigators found. Penn State review recasts story of football hero Paterno .

"(CNN) -- Two lesser lights stole the headlines as the San Antonio Spurs routed the Miami Heat 113-77 in Game Three of the 2013 NBA Finals. All talk ahead of the best-of-seven series centered on the ""Big Three"" on each team, with San Antonio's Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili set to take on Miami's LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. But it was Danny Green and Gary Neal of the Spurs who took the contest away from the defending champion at San Antonio's AT & Center on Tuesday as the home side took a 2-1 series lead. Green scored 27 points with Neal scoring 24 as San Antonio, which last won the title in 2007, sank a finals-record 16 three-pointers. ""Those guys stepping up on this stage in this game is huge for us,"" Duncan told reporters after finishing with 12 points and 14 rebounds. ""We talked about it before the series started, how we're going to have to have guys step up and guys play well in certain games. And we don't expect a performance like this from those kind of guys, but they were great."" Parker was forced to withdraw with a hamstring injury in the second half, but even the loss of San Antonio's star point guard couldn't prevent a crushing win. ""It's been a while since I shot the ball like that,"" said Green. ""A couple games in the season, I shot it pretty well, but tonight it was a totally different level of feeling -- comfort level on the perimeter."" San Antonio will now sweat over the fitness of Parker, who will have an MRI scan to judge whether he will be fit for Thursday's Game Four. Game Five, to be played on Sunday, will take place in San Antonio before the series return to Miami's American Airlines Arena. ""We didn't do anything right,"" said James, whose team lost in the 2011 finals. ""We can't play like that on either side of the floor if we want to win. ""At the end of the day it is just one win for them. We have to come out Thursday and do better.""","San Antonio Spurs beat Miami Heat 113-77 in Game Three of NBA Finals .

"(CNN) -- Egypt's democratically elected parliament met Monday for the first time since President Hosni Mubarak was ousted last year. But even with Mubarak out of power and facing criminal charges, Egypt still has a long way to go. The protests started exactly one year ago, on January 25. Many Egyptians say they are frustrated with the pace of change. There have even been violent clashes between protesters and the military, which has led the country since Mubarak resigned February 11. (Thousands gather in Cairo on anniversary) CNN's Ben Wedeman recently spoke to some prominent Egyptians about the country's ""unfinished revolution"" and why there is still unrest. Here is some of what they had to say: . Mohamed ElBaradei, former presidential candidate and Nobel Peace laureate . The army was welcomed as a savior, as the national army that stood by the people. As you remember, there were roses that were thrown over the tanks, that sort of thing. But then we started the whole mismanagement. The army got this hot potato on their lap. They didn't expect it to happen. They have zero experience managing the country politically, and they started to make one mistake after the other. ... Everybody after the revolution thought their salary would be tripled in three days. I mean, obviously, this was expected, but the army was very rough-handed in dealing with people. (The army) got into a sort of irrational way of going through the transition: Going through a parliamentary election before you have a constitution. Giving new political parties three months to organize and be able to compete with the Muslim Brotherhood, who have been on the ground for 80 years. Having all the weird laws about redistricting, about establishing new parties. It led to the country being decimated. Add to that 60 years of oppression, and it was like a pressure cooker, and all of a sudden the lid went up. There was a lot of vapor coming out. How to manage to get that into meaningful energy is still a question for us today. People were not used to democracy. People did not know how to be able to agree to disagree, didn't know how to work together. All of this is the result of years and years of repression. Gigi Ibrahim, prominent human rights activist . We didn't even believe we would get to Tahrir Square, let alone this would be a revolution. One person actually said, ""So if we get to Tahrir Square, then what?"" And the answer was, ""We'll figure it out when we get there."" Nobody imagined that this many people would go there; nobody imagined that this many people would show up. We were used to the same 20 to 50 people that showed up to every single protest, and they were mostly your friends and fellow activists. But January 25 was different. ... What made me realize that this was unstoppable was I looked behind me sometime, and I could not see the end of the march, like I couldn't see where the march ended. All I saw, whether I looked to my left or right or to the back, was a sea of people. I knew then there was no way of stopping this. ""What are they going to do? They can fire at us, but we are just so many this day."" ... Being a revolutionary myself and being in the street and taking part in these clashes, you know that all these people are fighting for a better Egypt. They don't have hidden agendas. They don't get finance from abroad. They are simply fighting for their rights, they're fighting for a better living, and they're not going to stop, because we sacrificed so much. We sacrificed so much to reach where we are right now. There is no way of going back. Hisham Qasim, newspaper publisher and human rights activist . You have now people on the street say, ""I thought this revolution was for me, but I've been jobless for the last three months."" ... Now there is a lot of frustration, and people are beginning to wonder whether things went wrong and whether they should have stayed under the Mubarak regime that was at least providing stability. ... There were too many expectations. Raising the expectations was probably the biggest mistake, and media probably have a great part to do with that. ... Media presented this as a revolution as opposed to an uprising. ... It put a lot of high hopes on the caretaker Cabinet. And eventually, as nothing was happening, the frustration level increased, and we began to see more and more protests, more and more violence and less and less faith in the future. So while the military has made serious mistakes, we should not have expected more. ... A lot were critical of (the ruling military's) slow pace, that it will take roughly 16 months, 18 months before we do the transition. I don't think it was possible in anything less than that. Tunisia was a much faster pace, but Tunisia is 10 million people. We are 80 million people. ... Over the next five years, when you start to built the instruments of good governance, a parliament, a judiciary, and establish civilian rule, the military will have to give up their privileges. It has to be slow. We need to avoid a collision course with them. ... If we go for reform too quickly or we get into a collision course with the military, remember Mauritania? Remember Sudan? They did have a free election, both countries, and yet they relapsed into military rule. Nour Nour, activist who was 20 years old at the time of the revolution . Very few people actually saw a full-scale revolution taking place that soon. I always knew it was coming. I didn't know it was going to come that soon. I was depending on the privileged upper-middle class members of the Egyptian society to hit the streets for the first time ... because I knew, sadly, there is a lot of classism in our culture, and no big change would come about in our society until those who were more privileged went to fight for those who were less fortunate. ... On the 11th of February, I felt that the hard bit was over, although I knew there was a lot of work to be done. The element of oppression, of being oppressed by the regime, I thought that was over. But over the last year, I realized not only was I mistaken, but there have been more attempts to oppress the Egyptian youth over the last year than during the 30 years of the Mubarak regime. ... I had been demonstrating for many years under the Mubarak regime, which is why it is ironic that the most times I've ever been beaten, the most times I've ever felt the threat of danger, was after Mubarak stepped down. And all of these are very basic indications that the regime that is ruling us at the moment is merely a continuation of the Mubarak regime, that its main intent or goal is to protect themselves from the revolution, not to protect the revolution. Ehsan Yahia, assistant lecturer at Cairo University . I didn't expect it to be this way. I didn't expect that it would be this big. Me and all my colleagues and friends, we were not aiming at bringing Mubarak down. We were just aiming at more social justice. We were aiming at reforming the police. So we didn't think that people would do that much support, but they did. ... I can tell you, I want peace. I don't want more protests. But if I didn't find any other way, I didn't find any other way. I am part of this country, and I've been asking for my rights in a peaceful way. But I didn't get it, and I didn't even get an explanation. And I have found violence. The army, the Supreme Council, we were thinking it was protecting us in the beginning of the revolution, Now it is violating our rights. We had some hope. Maybe we were naive. It's our first revolution! We have no experience.","Hosni Mubarak is no longer in power, but protests continue in Egypt .

"(CNN) -- Love regenerating alien time travelers who never leave home without a sonic screwdriver? American fans of the British sci-fi show, ""Doctor Who,"" are about to get a great Christmas present. This year, for the first time ever, BBC America is airing the ""Doctor Who"" Christmas special at 9 p.m. ET on Christmas Day -- the same day BBC airs the special in the UK. Since 2005, American fans of the franchise had to wait days, even weeks to see re-broadcasts of episodes and special events, first on Sci Fi Channel (now Syfy) and now on BBC America. Bloggers immediately assumed this unprecedented programming was an attempt to stamp out fan-related internet piracy. ""We're not waiting for it to air over here, we're watching it online. We're downloading it ahead of time. And not only that, we're watching the unedited versions. It wasn't until recently that (BBC America) started to ... air them unedited for time,"" said Aaron Cistrelli, president of the ""Doctor Who"" fan-club Time Meddlers of Los Angeles, based in Southern California, which has been around for 20 years. All that downloading ""means (American fans) love the shows so much they can't wait to see them,"" Richard de Croce, senior vice president of programming at BBC America said. ""And that's the world we live in, in terms of technology, quite honestly. So let's air these shows as quickly as we can post the UK's transmission,"" he said. And plans are in the works for season six of ""Doctor Who"" to be broadcast the same day in the United States as well, said de Croce. The Christmas special has been an extra fix of the show which airs in the spring. By winter, fans haven't seen any new adventures for a few months. In the UK, the Christmas specials of the last few years have reached ""event"" proportions. Whole families stay home on Christmas Day to watch the show. ""The one with David Tennant and Kylie Minogue in it I think was one of the highest viewed, non-sport television programs of the decade,"" said Steve Pugh of VisitLondon.com, and a ""Docor Who"" fan since age 7. This year's Christmas special, written by lead writer and executive producer, Steven Moffat, is called ""A Christmas Carol,"" and features Matt Smith as the 11th Doctor, a grumpy, Scrooge-like Michael Gambon (plays Professor Dumbledore in the ""Harry Potter"" movies) and opera singer Katherine Jenkins. ""I can honestly say I think it's the 'Christmasiest' Christmas special that 'Doctor Who' has ever done,"" said Piers Wenger, executive producer of the show along with Steven Moffat. The audience for ""Doctor Who"" in the UK is much broader than the American audience. Wenger points out that the show is actually quite popular with children in Britain, even airing at 7 p.m. there as opposed to a more adult 9 p.m. in the United States. While Anglophiles and sci-fi fans in the United States are generally aware of the show, which has a thriving cult following, it is still far from mainstream. But the show gets a friendly reception for being so ""fringe."" CBS late night talk show host Craig Ferguson -- who grew up watching ""Doctor Who"" in Scotland -- filmed an extravagant opening segment set to the ""Doctor Who"" theme song, on the night that he interviewed Smith. CBS didn't air the segment, but it went viral on the internet. ""I spent time with the cast in New York and Los Angeles,"" during a press tour for the show, Wenger said. ""And they were completely overwhelmed that people recognized them. They didn't expect that at all. I think American fans are every bit as passionate about our show as their British counterparts are."" Americans have known about this British import since the 1970s when episodes of ""Doctor Who"" were aired on PBS. The show is nearly 50 years old. It premiered in Britain in 1963 and ran until 1996, with eight actors playing the title role. The show returned in 2005 with Christopher Eccleston as Doctor Who and continued with David Tennant and now Matt Smith, the 11th actor to play the Doctor. Many fans have a strong allegiance to a particular Doctor. Tom Baker, Doctor Who from 1974 until 1981, is often sited as a favorite -- well-loved for his quirky performance, Afro hairstyle and multi-colored scarf. Smith's Doctor has also met with warm regard from fans. ""My favorite Doctor is Matt,"" Wenger said. ""I think that he is just incredibly gifted and able to steer the action from a moment of real high drama and kind of vitriol to a moment of brilliant physical comedy and I think that's why the show is in so many people's hearts."" ""I think I'm not alone in saying he's my favorite Doctor.""","American fans of sci-fi shows like ""Doctor Who"" don't like to wait for re-broadcasts .

"Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- Lights flicker on and off at any hour of the day, sending visitors' eyes toward the ceiling, while locals carry on without a pause. Blackouts are common in Myanmar, due to an old and neglected energy network that only reaches a quarter of the country's 60 million people. Even in the largest city, Yangon, only two-thirds of the population is connected to the grid. The rest rely on diesel generators and batteries. Some poorer neighborhoods receive as little as one hour of electricity a day. Aye Kyaing, 39, rents out a pool table in his one-room house in North Dagon Township in northern Yangon. Two lights -- a strip light and a single bulb -- cast a mild glow over the game. A small candle sits on the kitchen bench for when the lights go out. ""In 2011, it was really bad,"" he said. ""We lost electricity about two to three times a day for very long. This season, it's only happened twice."" New energy architecture . Delivering energy to 45 million people not currently serviced by the grid is one of the biggest challenges Myanmar faces as it embraces democracy after decades of military rule. ""Electricity access is crucial for education, it's crucial for health, it's crucial for other social kinds of support and social activities -- so it's much broader than just industrial or business needs,"" said Stephen Groff, vice president of the Asian Development Bank, while launching a new report ""New Energy Architecture"" at the World Economic Forum in Myanmar. Currently, Myanmar produces 75% of its electricity by burning wood from natural forests or hydropower, which all but grounds to a halt during the dry season from December to March. The country is rich in natural resources but until now anything extracted has been exported to China and Thailand. Myanmar's new policy, the government says, is to keep it at home. ""Because of the sanctions, we needed hard currency for development -- otherwise our country would be left behind,"" said Deputy Energy Minister Htin Aung. ""But our new policy is that natural resources that we find will be used as a priority for the domestic market. We are not going to sell it unless we fill our demand first,"" he said. ""If there is a surplus we will pursue value-added products and export."" He says current contracts will be honored -- ""it is the reputation of our country"" -- but no new export deals will be signed until domestic demand is satisfied. Decrepit power network . Patching the holes in Myanmar's decrepit power network will be no easy task, but in the meantime the country's being urged to take modern strides with mini off-grid solutions. It's worked in Laos, a country of six million people that borders Myanmar, China, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. In 2000 only 30% of Laotians had access to energy. Now 70% receive power from various grids. Simon Henschel is the chief operating officer of Sunlabob Renewable Energy, a private company that's been working with the government and villages to bring energy to rural Laos since 2001. ""In the north we've established a regional grid; three villages each have a hydro-turbine connected to a solar hybrid grid,"" he said. ""The hydro power runs every day, 24 hours, it's very powerful energy and the solar is for peak hours and makes it more efficient."" The hydro power station provides electricity to around 900 households in two villages. It's now connected to the main utility grid and a feed-in tariff has been agreed so that investors can earn money from the excess. Who those investors might be depends on government policy, which is yet to be decided. It could vary from village to village, Henschel says, depending on who has the money to invest and how long they can wait for returns. ""Some of the villages that I've seen here, the monasteries have huge influence,"" he said. ""We have had contact with Burmese monks who have money to pay for the grid systems for their surrounding villages. So there's different ownership business models and I think policy should be addressed to make it open."" If monks are at one end of Myanmar's potential energy solution, major players like Total, Chevron and China National Petroleum Company (CNPC) are at the other. After taking office in 2011, the Burmese government put dozens of on and offshore blocks up for tender, and another 20 offshore blocks are expected to be offered by the end of this year. Major pipelines . Right now, 16 foreign companies are working on 17 onshore oil blocks, and another 15 are involved in exploration or production at 20 existing offshore blocks, according to the report. By 2014, work is expected to finish on two major pipelines. CNPC is building a 771-kilometer (479-mile) pipeline through Myanmar to take oil from the Middle East and Africa to China. Another 870-kilometer (540-mile) pipeline will take gas overland from the Shwe gas field -- off the coast of western Rakhine State -- also to China. Shwe is one of two new gas fields due to open by the end of this year that are expected to double existing production, increasing exports to China and Thailand. While plans are in place to switch the power on in Myanmar, experts and the government warn it will take significant time and money. ""If you're going to see a change in electricity access from 26% where it is today, to what we would hope to reach by 2020 -- 60% -- there's a lot that needs to be done,"" said Groff. The minister added: ""We are working very hard to have a sustainable electricity in the very near future and for the longer term we have been planning a lot of things so there's sustainable energy for the whole country."" For many people it won't come a minute too soon. Han Thar Nyein contributed to this report.","Old and neglected energy network in Myanmar means regular power outages .

"London (CNN) -- A former archbishop of York was accused Friday of covering up child abuse by a Church of England clergyman who has since died. The accusations against the late Very Rev. Robert Waddington are the result of a joint investigation by the Times of London and The Australian newspaper, based in Sydney. The Times alleges that Waddington, who died in 2007 from cancer, abused choirboys and school children, and that the former archbishop of York, David Hope, failed to report the abuse claims to police or child protection authorities after he was made aware of them in 1999 and 2003. The former archbishop, who was made Lord Hope after he stood down in 2005, said he had followed the legal requirements of the time. ""Throughout my time as bishop and archbishop I always adhered to the statutory practices of the Church of England concerning safeguarding,"" he said in a statement Friday. ""I strenuously deny (and am obviously disappointed at) the suggestion that myself or my team at the time would have acted negligently in this or any other safeguarding matter."" Under the Church of England's 1999 Policy on Child Protection, there was no automatic legal obligation on the church to refer allegations by adults to the police or social services, his statement said. The policy, which has since been reviewed, said only that steps should be taken to protect children from any further abuse. ""In considering whether children would be at risk from Robert Waddington I decided under these guidelines that this would not be the case given his serious ill health following cancer surgery,"" Hope said. ""The following year I revoked Robert Waddington's permission to officiate. He died two years later."" Waddington, once dean of Manchester Cathedral, is accused in the Times of grooming and abusing Eli Ward, who was an 11-year-old choir boy when he first met the clergyman in 1984. Ward, now 40, told the newspaper the abuse lasted through his teenage years and he was only now starting to come to terms with it. Claims of abuse at the hands of Waddington have also been made by pupils at a residential school in Queensland, Australia, where he was headmaster from 1961 to 1970, according to the Times. The Diocese of Manchester said it was aware of the allegations of past abuse against its former dean and was ""working cooperatively with the parties concerned."" The diocese places the ""highest priority on all child safeguarding issues,"" and has a comprehensive child protection policy in place across its churches and schools, the statement said. ""We encourage all who have suffered abuse to report it to the police."" The bishop of Southwell and Nottingham, the Right Rev. Paul Butler, chairman of the Churches National Safeguarding Committee, said the church would always apologize for ""past systems that let down the vulnerable"" and offer support to anyone affected. ""When any church-related abuse or allegation of abuse comes to light our first concern is always for the victim: Both that they are being supported and with an acknowledgment that the effects of abuse can be lifelong,"" he said. The office of the archbishop of York said it was aware of legal proceedings and could not comment on the allegations at this time. ""For some years now the Church of England has been working consistently towards making the church a safe place for all,"" it added.","Former archbishop of York is accused of not alerting police to child abuse by a clergyman .

"Melissa Harris-Lacewell is associate professor of politics and African-American studies at Princeton University. She is the author of the award-winning book ""Barbershops, Bibles, and BET: Everyday Talk and Black Political Thought,"" and writes a daily blog titled The Kitchen Table. Melissa Harris-Lacewell says black politics has come of age, with blacks as equal partners in electing Obama. PRINCETON, New Jersey (CNN) -- It seems Tavis Smiley has been irritated with Barack Obama for a long time. Smiley is perhaps the most recognizable African-American journalist in the country. He is a fixture on radio and television, and has authored several books that are best-sellers among black readers. One might suspect that Smiley would be enthusiastic about the opportunities presented by America's election of a black president. Instead, Smiley seems annoyed. In February 2008, Smiley denounced then-candidate Obama for failing to make a personal appearance at Smiley's annual State of the Black Union. His continuing criticism of Sen. Obama during the fall campaign produced substantial outcry from listeners of the Tom Joyner Morning Show, a popular radio program where Smiley had been a well-liked regular. After Obama's election, Smiley published a text titled ""Accountable"" and has repeatedly indicated his intention to hold President Obama ""accountable"" to an explicitly racial agenda. The specific policies suggested by Smiley's books are not substantially different from those of the Obama administration, but Smiley insists on explicit and repeated acknowledgement of race, while Obama typically seeks to address inequality within a racially neutral frame. Despite writing about race in both of his books, addressing race in the historic Philadelphia speech during the Democratic primary and repeatedly acknowledging that racial inequality endures, Smiley's critique implies that Obama's approach to race is both inadequate and inauthentic. On May 24, TV One aired the latest installment of Smiley's accountability campaign: a two-hour documentary titled ""Stand."" Recycling Spike Lee's Million Man March film, ""Get On the Bus,"" Smiley assembled a group of prominent black male public figures for a bus ride through the South. Ostensibly, this bus trip would provide Smiley, professors Cornel West and Michael Eric Dyson, Dick Gregory and others an opportunity to reflect on the meaningful upheavals in American society and politics in the summer of 2008. ""Stand"" was an enormous disappointment. Its low production value, wandering narrative, flat history and self-important egoism did little to reveal the shortcomings of the Obama phenomenon. Instead, the piece exposed and embodied the contemporary crisis of the black public intellectual in the age of Obama. The film and its participants (two of them my senior colleagues at Princeton University) appropriated the legacy of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. to implicitly claim that they, not Obama, are the authentic representatives of the political interests of African-Americans. They used King's images and speeches, gathered on the balcony where King was assassinated, and explicitly asserted their desire to play King to Obama's LBJ, and Frederick Douglass to Obama's Lincoln. On its face, this is not a bad model. Presidents are deeply constrained by the structural and political limitations of their office. A robust administration needs an active and informed citizenry to engage, push, cajole, criticize and applaud its efforts. But this appropriation misrepresents rather than preserves King's legacy. King was a powerful questioner and, at times, ally of President Johnson because he was at the helm of a massive social movement of men and women who were shut out of the ordinary political process. It was not King's intellectual capacity or verbal dexterity that made him an effective advocate for racial issues; it was his own accountability to that movement. This is not true of Smiley and his ""soul patrol,"" who are mostly public personalities and tenured professors largely unaccountable to the black constituency. King's meager income, though supplemented by the lecture circuit, was grounded in the voluntary contributions of black churchgoers. Smiley is backed by powerful corporations, like Wal-Mart and Nationwide, that have troubled relationships with these communities. The college profs on the bus are comfortably supported by well-endowed universities. This does not invalidate their views on race, but it does make the analogy with King a poor fit. Further, Smiley and his ""soul patrol"" seemed to have missed the intervening 40 years between the era of King and the election of Obama. African-Americans are no longer fully disfranchised subjects of an oppressive state. African-Americans are now citizens capable of running for office, holding officials accountable through democratic elections, publicly expressing divergent political preferences and, most importantly, engaging the full spectrum of American political issues, not only narrowly racial ones. The era of racial brokerage politics, when the voices of a few men stood in for the entire race, is now over. And thank goodness it is over. Black politics is growing up. The men of ""Stand"" yearned for an imagined racial past. By their accounting, this racial past had better music, more charismatic leaders and a more-involved black church. Their romanticism ignores the cultural contributions of contemporary black youth, forgets the dangerous limitations of charismatic leadership and revises the fraught, complicated relationship of black churches to struggles for racial equality. And these men ignored the democratizing effect of new media forms, which revolutionized the 2008 election. Black people were not duped by some slick, media-generated candidate. African-Americans were co-authors of the Obama campaign. Through social networks, YouTube videos, political blogs and new-media echo chambers, black people were equal partners in shaping the candidate and his campaign. There was no need for the entrenched pundit class to tell black voters what to think or how to behave; they figured it out for themselves. Still, there is plenty to criticize in the young Obama administration: the refusal to prosecute those implicated in the torture memos, civilian casualties caused by drone attacks, bank bailouts and inadequate defense of gay rights to name a few.  But black communities are already engaged in these critiques and many others. Black local organizers, elected officials, bloggers, pundits and columnists have taken substantive, specific positions on a broad range of issues. In black communities, nonprofit organizations continue to work for justice, and charities still try to fill the gap during tough economic times. African-Americans are engaged as mature citizens ought to be: in both discourse and action. This political maturity is precisely the source of the black public intellectual crisis: What do Smiley and the Soul Patrol add to this process? Their bus never stopped at a Habitat for Humanity site to build a home or at a soup kitchen to serve the hungry. Their dialogue centered more on the relative merits of Aretha vs. Beyonce than on meaningful political issues. Though they spoke with elders, their self-congratulatory revelry never paused to engage any elected officials, issues specialists or local activists. And while they talked a great deal about women, they never spoke to a woman. ""Stand"" was sad because I still believe in a role for black public intellectuals. Scholars and journalists often have a particular capacity for curiosity, questioning and issue synthesis that has real value in public discourse. It was painfully clear that this particular accountability crusade is not informed by any of those skills. Instead, it seems determined to stand in the way of the maturation of African-American politics in order to maintain personal power. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Melissa Harris-Lacewell.","Melissa Harris-Lacewell: Some have said Obama should be held to racial agenda .

"(CNN) -- A 23-year-old man accused of killing four people during a New York stabbing and carjacking spree was indicted Friday, prosecutors said. Maksim Gelman has been charged with murder in the second degree, attempted murder in the second degree, robbery and assault, according to a Kings County District Attorney statement. Authorities alleged that Gelman fatally stabbed three people, hit and killed a man with a car, slashed at least five other people and carjacked two vehicles before he was wrestled to the ground early Saturday after trying to break into the cab of a subway train. If convicted, he could face life behind bars. Gelman, who is unemployed and known to authorities mostly as a graffiti artist, was arrested about 9 a.m. Saturday, about 28 hours after he is alleged to have begun the spree spanning three New York boroughs, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said Saturday. ""It's so horrendous and bizarre,"" Kelly told reporters Saturday. ""We have no reason that we can give you as to why he did this."" Police believe Gelman got into a dispute with his mother at her Brooklyn home about 5 a.m. Friday after she refused to let him take her 2004 Lexus. The suspect's stepfather, Aleksandr Kuznetsov, intervened and was stabbed 11 times, they said. Kuznetsov, 54, died, while Gelman's mother -- who survived unscathed -- alerted authorities. Investigators believe Gelman then took the Lexus, drove about a mile away to the home of his ex-girlfriend and stabbed her mother, 56-year-old Anna Bulchenko, 11 times, at about 10:30 a.m. Gelman's former girlfriend found her mother dead on the floor when she returned home at about 4:15 p.m., police said. She called police. But in the short period before they arrived, authorities believe Gelman -- who presumably was still in the apartment -- allegedly attacked the former girlfriend, Yelena Bulchenko, 20, with a knife. He chased her into the street and killed her, also slashing the jacket sleeve of a passerby trying to stop him, authorities said. He then left the scene in the Lexus and rear-ended another car, a Pontiac Bonneville, allegedly stabbing its 60-year-old driver three times in the shoulder and neck in a confrontation and then leaving the scene in that car, police said. Authorities said they later found four kitchen knives in the Lexus. About 4:25 p.m., the Pontiac allegedly struck a pedestrian about two miles away, Kelly said. Steve Tannenbaum, 60, died of his injuries. Police believe the suspect eventually abandoned the Pontiac, which was later found near a Brooklyn railroad line he was known to frequent as a graffiti artist. Shortly before 1 a.m. Saturday, Gelman allegedly got into a cab in Brooklyn and stabbed the driver. As of Saturday, that driver was in stable condition. Kelly said Gelman then got out of the car and confronted a couple, allegedly stabbing a man in the hands and taking his car keys. That man was treated and released at a hospital, Kelly said. The car, a Nissan, was later found in Queens. Shelton Pottinger told reporters he was that victim. ""He looked crazy,"" he said of the man who stabbed him. ""He looked like a crazy guy."" He said the man pulled a knife and a gun and told him to get out of the car or he would kill him. ""I was shocked,"" he said. ""I didn't know what to do."" But he said he decided to fight, and moved over into the passenger seat. ""I was trying to kick him to get him out."" But he said the man forced his way in and hit the gas. Pottinger said he was holding on to the man's hands as he tried to stab him. Police received a tip Saturday morning that the suspect might have been riding a southbound subway train in Manhattan. A woman approached police at a subway stop and said Gelman knocked a newspaper featuring his picture from her hands and said to her, ""Do you believe what they're writing about me?"" before crossing the tracks and jumping onto a train. The man stabbed a seated passenger -- 40-year-old Joseph Lozito, who said he didn't know the suspect or about the alleged stabbing spree until he landed in the hospital -- during his time onboard. Gelman allegedly told Lozito, ""You're going to die"" before attacking him with the knife from above. ""Eventually, the man worked his way to the front cab of the train. The commissioner said the suspect pounded on the cab's door, yelling ""Police,"" apparently trying to get in by claiming he was a police officer. He did not appear to know two transit police officers, later identified as Terrance Howell and Tamara Taylor, were inside the cab with the train's operator. Soon after, the officers, with aid from off-duty New York police Detective Marcelo Razzo and an unnamed civilian nearby, wrestled Gelman to the ground, police said. No one was hurt in that scuffle, during which a knife fell to the ground. Police also found Gelman had another, smaller, knife when they detained him. He also had what Kelly described as a ""significant amount of money."" Kelly said the suspect was mostly ""incoherent"" after being arrested, making a statement that ""she had to die."" The commissioner said he did not know who ""she"" referred to. Kelly said Gelman had 10 previous arrests, mostly for drug charges and graffiti, plus one robbery charge. His most recent arrest was January 26, when he was accused of possessing crack cocaine. For roughly the past seven years, Gelman has been a naturalized U.S. citizen. He arrived in this country with his father and mother in 1992 from his native Ukraine.","Maksim Gelman was indicted on murder, robbery and assault charges .

It'll be a quiet movie, but we predict that with Michelle in the lead, bonnets will become the new cool girl thing to wear. ""Higher Ground"": Vera Farmiga isn't just one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, in my humble opinion -- she's also the smartest. This flick is her directorial debut, about a woman who spends 20 years in a fundamentalist commune and finally decides to leave. ""The Future"": We love Miranda July, so will forgive the fact that the plot of her new movie -- a 30-something couple slowly falls apart -- sounds an awful lot like ""Blue Valentine,"" only with brown, curly hair rather than blondes. We also hear that it's narrated by a cat? ""My Idiot Brother"": We're still so glad that Paul Rudd's beard was grown for a movie and not just because. In this comedy, Paul stars as the slacker brother of three uber-ambituous sisters, played by Elizabeth Banks, Zooey Deschanel, and Emily Mortimer.

The movie is funded by the products you see in it. ""Like Crazy"": Long-distance relationships are rough. Like, really hard. This movie, which already has some great buzz going, tells the story of a young couple that meets in college and then has to split when one of them has to return to the UK.

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities have launched a criminal investigation into the practices at the company linked to a fungal meningitis outbreak blamed for 23 deaths, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick told reporters Tuesday. In addition, the Board of Registration in Pharmacy has voted to revoke permanently the New England Compounding Center's license to operate in Massachusetts as well as the licenses of the company's three principal pharmacists, Patrick said. The announcements came in the wake of a damning nine-page report, released Tuesday by the board, which is part of the state's Department of Public Health. Investigators for the state's DPH, working with their counterparts at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, ""identified serious deficiencies and significant violations of pharmacy law and regulations that clearly placed the public's health at risk,"" it said. According to the investigator's preliminary findings, the Compounding Center: . -- Distributed large quantities of its products to facilities, ""apparently for general use rather than requiring a prescription for an individual patient"" as state law requires. -- Distributed two recalled lots of methylprednisolone acetate before it had learned the results of sterility tests. -- Did not follow proper sterilization standards. -- Produced vials of methylprednisolone that were later recalled that contained ""visible black particulate matter."" -- Failed to thoroughly clean powder hoods, which are intended to protect pharmacists from inhaling substances while medication is being prepared, which ""may subsequently lead to contamination of compounded medications."" -- Used ""visibly soiled"" mats outside ""clean rooms,"" potentially leading to their contamination. -- Failed to repair a leaking boiler adjacent to the clean room, which resulted in a pool of water around the boiler and adjacent walls creating an unsanitary condition. Patrick said the state would begin making unannounced inspections of pharmacies that prepare injectable medications and require that they submit annual reports detailing what they produce, how much of it and where it is distributed. ""It is now clear that the New England Compounding Center violated state law and endangered the health of countless patients,"" said U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Massachusetts, in a statement. The senior member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the FDA, vowed to introduce legislation to improve safety of drugs made by compounding pharmacies. The incident began unfolding on September 24, when the department said it was notified about a cluster of six rare fungal meningitis cases in Tennessee. The patients shared several risk factors, including an epidural injection of a steroid -- methylprednisolone acetate 80 mg/ml preservative free -- that had been compounded at NECC in Framingham, Massachusetts. The department soon learned that the suspect product had been distributed to more than 14,000 patients in 23 states. Investigators arriving at the company on September 26 ""found NECC employees cleaning sterile compounding areas and and conducting environmental testing,"" the report says. ""DPH investigators also detected signs of bleach decontamination in the compounding areas."" DPH has asked two other companies -- Ameridose and Alaunus Pharmaceutical -- to cease all pharmacy operations based on their shared ownership and leadership with New England Compounding Center. On October 15, federal authorities said that another NECC steroid injection, triamcinolone acetonide, might have caused a patient to acquire fungal meningitis, and they began contacting all 192 state facilities that received any NECC injectable products. Three days later, the FDA confirmed that sealed vials of methylprednisolone acetate had been contaminated with fungi. On Monday, the board authorized DPH staff to seek the permanent surrender of the licenses of the NECC principals, who are prohibited from practicing pharmacy throughout any appeals. ""NECC's transparency in dealing with the board since inception in 1998 demonstrates its good faith intention to operate in compliance with the requirements of its license,"" said Paul Cirel, a Boston-based lawyer representing the compounder, in a statement on Tuesday. ""Furthermore, the company's intention and best efforts at compliance are equally applicable in every other state in which it has been licensed."" Tuesday's events came a day after the Food and Drug Administration posted on its website a list of more than 1,200 hospitals and clinics that it said had purchased drugs from the compounding center that, if contaminated, would be especially dangerous. But the agency took down the list after discovering inaccuracies. ""FDA has found some technical problems with the list and the data are incorrect,"" the agency said in a statement on its website. ""FDA is working to correct the list and will re-post when we are sure it is accurate."" Tennessee has been the hardest-hit state in the meningitis outbreak, with 70 cases as of Tuesday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Michigan is a close second, with 68 cases as of Tuesday. In all, 308 cases have been tallied.

"On June 3 - 5, the UK's Queen Elizabeth II marks her Diamond Jubilee year with a series of parties and pageants. CNN's Piers Morgan and Brooke Baldwin will be there to follow the festivities. Join them at the following times: June 5: 0900 (ET), 1400 (CET). London (CNN) -- When Queen Elizabeth II took to the Thames to mark her diamond jubilee alongside tens of thousands of well-wishers, it wasn't the first time the royals have made merry by messing about on the river. For centuries, Britain's monarchs have celebrated their biggest occasions on the water, creating scenes that have inspired generations of artists, musicians and writers. Constitutional historian David Starkey says the Thames has long been ""Britain's royal river and London's 'grandest street,' "" playing host to a string of colorful regal festivities. ""The grandest royal river pageants have always been used to celebrate the coronation and inauguration,"" said Starkey, guest curator of the ""Royal River"" exhibition at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. Handel's famed ""Water Music"" and his ""Music for the Royal Fireworks"" were both written for regal Thameside festivities in the 18th century. And diarists Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn wrote of the spectacle they witnessed when King Charles II took part in a pageant in 1660, a year after the restoration of the monarchy. Pepys described the scene as the king and queen journeyed downriver from Hampton Court to Whitehall ""under a canopy with 10,000 barges and boats, I think, for we could see no water for them."" For Evelyn, the event was ""the most magnificent triumph that ever floated on the Thames."" He wrote admiringly of ""the innumerable boates and vessells dress'd and adorn'd with all imaginable pomp ... the thrones, arches ... stately barges ... musiq and peals of ordnance both from ye vessels and the shore."" Now things have come full circle: The Diamond Jubilee pageant was partially inspired by the work ""The Thames on Lord Mayor's Day"" by 18th-century artist Canaletto. Italian artist Giovanni Antonio Canal (1697-1768) -- better known as Canaletto -- painted the piece (seen above) while living in London in the 1740s and 1750s. Canaletto was most famous for his depictions of the lavish celebrations along the canals of his native Venice, and found a similarly festive subject during his stay in Britain. Today, the painting is part of the Lobkowicz Collection in Prague. Currently on loan to the ""Royal River"" exhibition to mark the jubilee, it has an intriguing history. In the gallery's audio guide, chief curator John Somerville explains how the work was purchased from the artist by Ferdinand Philip, the sixth Prince Lobkowicz of Bohemia, while he was in London buying horses -- and carrying on a scandalous affair with the wife of the Venetian ambassador. It was displayed in the family's homes for generations, until it was stolen by the Nazis during World War II. Hidden for years in an Austrian salt mine, it was finally returned to Prague at the end of the war, only to be confiscated again by the Communists in 1948. Following the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, the Lobkowicz family, who had long since fled to the United States, set about reclaiming the collection. Somerville says the painting shows a time when ""the Thames was the main highway, the lifeblood of the city, filled with craft of every size, making their way up and down and across the river."" And it is exactly this that the organizers of the 2012 event hoped to emulate, with ""a piece of theater on the water"" -- complete with music, fireworks and special effects -- not to mention 20,000 people on a 7-mile-long flotilla made up of 1,000 boats. ""What more appropriate way of celebrating the Diamond Jubilee of the queen, who will herself, at the climax of the celebrations, lead another grand royal river pageant?"" Starkey asked.","Seven-mile-long flotilla of 1,000 boats traveled along Thames to mark queen's jubilee .

"(CNN) -- Women stood at the forefront of the Arab Spring, taking to the streets shoulder to shoulder with men in an effort to overturn oppressive old orders. But while their efforts have seen dictators ousted and reforms introduced, the greater rights for women many hoped would emerge from the upheaval have not materialized. Indeed, says Lebanese activist Diala Haidar, the rise of political Islam throughout the region in the wake of the uprising has raised the specter of hard-won gains for women being lost. Haidar and four other women's rights activists across the region started a campaign, The Uprising of Women in the Arab World, on Facebook in October 2011, to highlight injustices against women throughout the region. ""The Arab Spring took place under the banner of freedom, dignity and equality, and the three can't be established if women are left behind,"" said Haidar, 28, a laboratory supervisor. ""At every stage of history we have been given the excuse, 'It's not the time to discuss women's issues -- we are at war, it's a revolution,' or whatever. It's our time to say 'We need our rights,'"" she added. Read more: Going under the knife for a manly mustache . The Facebook page has attracted more than 78,000 ""likes"" and there is now a website. Two campaigns are currently running: One asks people to submit photos with a message of solidarity with women in the region written in Arabic. The other, launched on United Nations' International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women on November 25, encourages women to share their stories of violence, abuse and harassment, in an effort to shine a spotlight on such incidents. Dozens of women have given their accounts, with a recurring theme that they have felt unable to speak out or hold the perpetrators to account. ""The revolution won't take place in secrecy, it will take place in the light,"" said Haidar. ""We have to start sharing our stories and concerns and aspirations publicly. It can prove that these incidents ... are not exceptional cases but part of a whole society that we should work to cure from this violence."" One account of abuse on the website is given by Rahma, a 22-year-old Tunisian woman, who writes of being sexually molested aged nine by a man who she says has never been held accountable. ""In our culture, these issues are taboos and it is better to suppress them for the sake of the family's 'honor,'"" she writes. ""What an absurd honor."" Haidar says the campaign is trying to challenge patriarchal cultural attitudes surrounding ""honor,"" often enshrined in discriminatory legal systems that punish the victims of sexual crimes. ""We have to get rid of the blame that society inflicts upon us when it comes to issues of sexual harassment, rape and domestic violence,"" she added. Read more: In Lawrence of Arabia's footsteps . In a recent case highlighting the extent of the problem, a 27-year-old Tunisian woman who was allegedly raped by two policemen after they approached her and her fiance in a car was subsequently charged with indecency, which carries a potential six-month sentence, when she filed a complaint against the officers. The charges were eventually dropped (although the prosecutor has appealed the ruling), and the woman was offered a state apology, but not before the case attracted large protests and criticism that the woman's treatment reflected the attitudes of the country's new Islamist leaders. Earlier this year, international outrage erupted over the plight of a 16-year-old Moroccan girl who committed suicide after a court ordered her to marry her rapist. Read more: My heart is still in Gaza . A rise in sexual violence in the form of mob attacks on women on the streets was a pressing issue in post-revolutionary Egypt, said Haidar, as was the concern that women's equality would not be enshrined in the sharia-influenced draft constitution. Haidar added that the campaign was targeting other issues across the region including the persistence of patriarchal personal status laws, honor killings, female genital mutilation and forced marriages. Fatima Nabil, 16, from Aden, Yemen, submitted a painting to the campaign. ""I have a friend my age who was forced out of school into marriage,"" she told CNN. Her paintings were an attempt to ""express the injustice suffered by women, because they live in darkness and constraint,"" she said. But Haidar said it is still ""too early"" to say that the Arab Spring has failed women and that could only happen if women allowed it. ""They can't betray women as long as we stand up for our rights and take advantage of this moment in history,"" she said. ""If we consent to this it will happen, but if we don't it will never happen.""","Women took to the streets during the Arab Spring demanding greater rights .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A woman described as a ""struggling actress"" filed a sex harassment lawsuit against actor David Boreanaz Thursday, claiming he made unwanted sexual advances while offering her a role on his TV series ""Bones."" Kristina Hagan's suit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, said she was working as an extra in an episode of the crime drama in August 2009 when Boreanaz approached her and said he had ""the ability to make things happen for her."" A statement from a representative for Boreanaz called the accusations ""totally fabricated and absurd."" ""There is no validity to this lawsuit,"" the statement said. ""She is an actress who is working towards her goals, but who like many other actresses has not yet been able to achieve them,"" Hagan's lawyer, Gloria Allred, said. ""For that reason she is extremely vulnerable as many actresses are in Hollywood."" Allred said she also represents another woman who has filed a charge of sexual harassment in employment against Boreanaz. Boreanaz, 41, stars in the series and is also an executive producer. ""She is informed and believes that he has used his 'star power' and position to entice women who have a desire to act on the show 'Bones' by promising or implying that he could get them work on the show and then using their vulnerability to obtain sexual favors from them,"" Hagan's suit said. The lawsuit described several instances in which Hagan alleged Boreanaz tried to grope and kiss her. ""Ms. Hagan did her best to deter his sexual advances, but did so in such a manner that she would not offend him since he had offered to assist her in her acting career,"" the suit said. The harassment also involved cell phone text messages from Boreanaz to Hagan, including one with a photo of the actor's genitals attached, the suit said. ""Ms. Hagan was offended by the text messages but nevertheless wanted to maintain a relationship with him because it was very important to her to secure employment as she was a struggling actress,"" the suit said. Hagan was never given a role in the show, according to the suit. The lawsuit claims that Hagan has suffered ""emotional and psychological distress, wage losses, and loss of benefits"" because of the harassment. It also names as defendants several production companies involved in the show, including 20th Century Fox Television.

"London, England (CNN) -- Her outfits don't send royal fashion watchers into a frenzy like those of the Duchess of Cambridge or Princess Diana before her, but Queen Elizabeth II has developed a signature style that has withstood the test of time. Her attire over the last 60 years has reflected the sovereign as a British symbol of refined, regal elegance. The looks she has worn have steadily evolved into her trademark -- monochromatic color with matching coat and hat. Not one to wear sombre, muted hues like black or beige, the queen has always had a preference for vivid blues, intense greens and dazzling purples in a variety of dramatic shades. Over the past six decades, Her Majesty has employed the talents of several British designers. One of her first designers was Norman Hartnell, who worked for her in the 1940s and created many of the full-skirted evening silk dresses she wore to various events as a glamorous young princess. As a newly crowned queen in the early 1950s, she chose Savile Row tailor Hardy Amies to create elegant evening gowns for her waspish 23-inch (58cm) waist. He was granted the coveted Royal Warrant in 1955. Amies once famously declared: ""I do not dress the queen. The queen dresses herself. We supply her with her clothes -- there is a difference."" Two decades later the queen chose a young designer, Ian Thomas, to soften her look with ""flowing chiffon dresses,"" according to the British Monarchy website. Couture designer Karl-Ludwig Rehse started making outfits for Her Majesty in 1988 and the queen still wears his designs. He also dressed the late Queen Mother and describes the queen's clothes as a work uniform. He told CNN: ""They have to be comfortable in as much as when the queen puts on the clothes she wants to forget about them. ""You have to take into account the different countries and the different climates in which they'll be worn. The queen always makes sure that she follows the tradition."" While most people would be hard pressed to imagine what they will be wearing the next day, the queen's wardrobe is planned out months in advance, says Rehse. ""It's not the case that the queen is going somewhere next week and thinks 'What am I going to wear?' Sometimes it is six months, 12 months or longer."" See a map of Royal London . A very VIP patron . One person who is currently in the queen's fashion inner circle is couturier and wedding dress designer Stewart Parvin. He first started making royal outfits in 2000 and recalls the secretive selection process that took place before he started working for the queen. ""At first I wasn't told who it was for,"" Parvin told CNN. ""It was, 'Could you design for someone who is a really prominent person in the public eye and wants a very chic image?' I thought it was going to be a politician or a tycoon's wife. I put together a packet of sketches but it wasn't until they were chosen I knew who they were for."" ""She is someone who is very interested in her clothes. She always has an opinion on it and she has a very informed opinion and she knows when it's right and she knows when it's wrong,"" said Parvin, who designs two couture collections a year and was in 2007 awarded the Royal Warrant -- given to designers who have worked with the queen for five years or more. An ensemble fit for a queen . Both Parvin and Rehse told CNN the queen is very involved in the design process, culminating with fittings at Buckingham Palace. ""Sometimes I choose the fabric and then propose ideas for them, as I would do for any client,"" said Parvin. ""I put together a scheme, maybe four designs for one fabric combination, then she would look at them and either choose a design straight away or suggest some changes."" Rehse says the queen asks him to come up with two or three different alternatives for a particular fabric she likes before settling on a final design. ""I do get a lot of input from the queen,"" said Rehse. ""The pressure is there but I take great joy out of it and it's very rewarding to see Her Majesty wearing my clothes in public."" In addition to warrant-holding royal designers, Her Majesty also has a senior dresser and personal assistant, Angela Kelly. The daughter of a Liverpool dockworker, dressmaker Kelly originally joined the royal household as a maid before working her way up to her current position. She established the first ever in-house couturier and has gone on to design outfits for some of the most enviable royal events including last year's wedding of Prince William to Kate Middleton. Known to have a close relationship with the queen, it has been noted by some royal observers that Kelly has slipped into the vacancies left by the deaths of the queen's sister and mother. Kelly and her team use old and new fabrics when designing for the queen using material given to her from when she was a princess, according to the Buckingham Palace website. Hats off to Her Majesty! Milliner Philip Somerville received a royal warrant following 12 years working for the queen. Now, when the queen steps out she's usually wearing a Somerville creation. ""You have to realize that you are never sure when Her Majesty will wear (a particular hat),"" he said. ""It depends on the weather on many occasions. You are also creating something that has to be very wearable and must be in colors that suit her. She must be noticed in a crowd."" After 33 years in the business, Somerville stepped down as the queen's hatter handing the business over to Dillon Wallwork. ""I've been here for some time now and we've always had a Philip Somerville look which is very clean, understated and elegant,"" said Wallwork. Creating a hat fit for a queen is not without its pressures, Wallwork says. ""You know you are under a certain pressure because of the press and what people are going to say,"" he said. ""You know she is going to be looked at. There are certain styles that you can and can't do but within those limits there's lots that you can do. It's quite a challenge but the queen can be quite adventurous.""","Famed for her unique hats and bold colors, the queen has a trademark fashion style .

"(CNN) -- Sudan's president was seen smiling, dancing and speaking to a huge crowd of supporters Thursday, a day after a warrant was issued for his arrest on war crimes charges. Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir waves to supporters in Khartoum on Wednesday. The display of defiance came as international aid agencies were being ordered to leave the country in retaliation for the move by the International Criminal Court over six years of bloodshed in the country's Darfur region. The streets of the capital, Khartoum, were filled with people who raised their hands in the air to cheer President Omar al-Bashir, who raised both fists defiantly in the air. The crowd was filled with posters and banners featuring al-Bashir's face or the flag of Sudan. The one banner written in English read, ""We are all with al-Bashir."" Al-Bashir gave a fervent speech to the crowd, denouncing the United States, its Western allies and Israel. At one point, the crowd repeated in English, ""Down, down, USA!"" Music before and after the speech got everyone moving, including the president, who smiled broadly and raised his walking stick in the air. A camouflaged helicopter swooped over the crowd. Angry but peaceful demonstrations took place in cities throughout Sudan on Wednesday after the warrant was announced, according to the United Nations. Government air and ground forces conducted what the United Nations called a ""show of force"" in parts of Darfur, where the situation was ""calm but unpredictable."" The International Criminal Court at The Hague, Netherlands, issued the warrant Wednesday for war crimes and crimes against humanity. It accuses al-Bashir of complicity in a campaign of violence against the people of Darfur, in the west of the country. The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in western Sudan's Darfur region, and 2.5 million have been forced to flee their homes. Sudan has angrily rejected the accusations and the indictment. Kamal Obaid, Sudan's state minister of information and communications, called the ICC a ""white man's tribunal"" and the arrest warrant ""an insult."" It has told as many as 10 humanitarian groups to leave the country, and seized the agencies' assets, U.N. deputy spokeswoman Marie Okabe said.","Sudan's president seen dancing and smiling after war crimes charges issued .

"SAN ANGELO, Texas (CNN) -- The Texas branch of the American Civil Liberties Union said it was concerned that the basic rights of the children and mothers connected to a Texas polygamist ranch were violated during a recent raid and custody hearing. At the hearing Friday, Judge Barbara Walther ordered 416 children connected to the YFZ (Yearning For Zion) ranch kept in state custody. Walther made her ruling after two days of testimony at the hearing, which was aimed at determining whether child welfare authorities properly removed the children from the sect's Texas ranch. The judge said she found sufficient evidence for Texas Child Protective Services to retain custody of the children. The ACLU said it had a representative at the court hearing and the organization was concerned about human rights violations. ""While we acknowledge that Judge Walther's task may be unprecedented in Texas judicial history, we question whether the current proceedings adequately protect the fundamental rights of the mothers and children,"" Terri Burke, executive director of the ACLU of Texas, said in a written statement. ""As this situation continues to unfold, we are concerned that the constitutional rights that all Americans rely upon and cherish -- that we are secure in our homes, that we may worship as we please and hold our places of worship sacred, and that we may be with our children absent evidence of imminent danger -- have been threatened,"" Burke said. The group's courtroom observer, Lisa Graybill, added: ""We recognize that this balancing act is difficult, but we are concerned that government may not be complying with the Constitution or the laws of Texas in the execution of its mandate, from how the raids were conducted to whether the current process protects basic rights."" The ACLU statement did not list any specific instances of human rights or constitutional violations, and ACLU representatives did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Child Protective Services spokeswoman Marleigh Meisner said her department is in the process of finding ""temporary placement"" for all the children. ""What we did was warranted and in the best interest of the children,"" she said. ""This is not about religion -- this is about keeping children safe from abuse."" The hearing stems from an April 4 raid of the ranch, which authorities said was triggered by phone calls in late March from a 16-year-old officials referred to as Sarah. The caller said she had been beaten and forced to become a man's ""spiritual"" wife. On Thursday, child protection supervisor Angie Voss testified that she and other investigators encountered several pregnant teenagers at the YFZ ranch, which is in Eldorado, Texas, about 40 miles outside San Angelo. The girls called each other ""sister wives,"" Voss said, and believed it was acceptable to be ""spiritually united"" with a man at any age. ""It was the belief that no age was too young to be married,"" she said. Members of the ranch have denied the girl, supposedly named Sarah Jessop Barlow, exists, and authorities have yet to find the caller. However, Texas Rangers are pursuing a Colorado woman as a ""person of interest"" regarding the phone calls that touched off the raid. Authorities on Friday said a search of Rozita Swinton's home in Colorado Springs resulted in evidence that possibly links her to phone calls made about the YFZ ranch. Swinton, 33, has been charged in Colorado with false reporting to authorities, but police said that the arrest was not directly related to the Texas case.

"(CNN) -- I've just listened to NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre suggest we need guns in our schools because ""our society is populated by an unknown number of genuine monsters."" I cringed. After his further suggestion that the United States create a nationwide database for the mentally ill, I got angry. Leaving aside the issue of medical privacy laws, I found it ironic that an organization so vehemently opposed to gun registration would propose such a measure. NRA clear on gun debate stance: Arm schools . As a parent, it's been heartbreaking to watch television coverage of the shooting of 20 innocent children, six teachers and the gunman's mother in Newtown, Connecticut. But as the parent of a wonderful young man with Asperger's syndrome, coping as pundits and journalists link this diagnosis to the crime in an attempt to find meaning has added another layer of anger and grief to an already stressful situation. LaPierre's remarks were the latest salvo in a campaign of misinformation and fear mongering about mental illness, sparked by news reports that shooter Adam Lanza had been diagnosed with Asperger's, a type of autism. Groups: Autism not to blame for violence . In 2006, my son Josh, then 12, and I visited the StoryCorps booth in New York, where members of the public are encouraged to tell their stories for the program that airs on National Public Radio. It was a difficult time for both of us. Josh was an honors student, but he found the increasing use of nonverbal social cues confusing. Kids weren't as tolerant of differences as they were in elementary school, and he was bullied. My divorce from Josh's dad was dragging on. Josh and I talked regularly, but there is something magical about being face-to-face in the quiet of the StoryCorps booth. Six years later, I still get e-mails from people thanking us for sharing that moment of parent/child intimacy. Last Saturday I sat down with Josh, now 19, who was already anxious about his upcoming finals week at college, for another lengthy conversation. We discussed what he might see on TV or online and the thoughtless yet hurtful comments he might encounter in his real life from people who have learned what little they know about Asperger's from misleading media coverage in the wake of Newtown. I wanted to ensure that he understood whatever drove that deeply troubled young man to do what he did, it wasn't because he may or may not have had a diagnosis of Asperger's. I want Josh to understand that no matter what anyone says, he is not a ""monster."" I have Asperger's; I am just like you . Josh finds the spotlight uncomfortable, but he gave me permission to write this piece because we both feel it so important that everyone, including Wayne LaPierre, the NRA and each and every journalist who has access to a nationwide audience, knows this too. As a journalist myself, I implore my colleagues to be more responsible, to consider the impact they have with their words in the dangerous rush to be the first to find ""answers."" When my son was diagnosed at age 5, I had many feelings of my own to sort out, a process made infinitely more difficult by others rushing to judgment. Like that 30-minute, long-distance haranguing from a member of my ex-husband's family asking me why I was ""damaging"" my child by ""labeling"" him. Imagine how much more reluctant families will be to accept a diagnosis now if there is a link in their minds with being a potential mass murderer -- even when there is no evidence whatsoever this is the case. Sandy Hook legacy may be backlash against autism . ""We're very concerned about families feeling stigmatized and being afraid to seek services for fear that their child will be seen as a possible 'monster,'"" said Sara Reed, director of advocacy and family services for an autism resource center in Connecticut. ""We've done so much work in the last few years trying to reduce stigma and isolation -- to help families get the support and services that they need and deserve.

"Samut Sakorn, Thailand (CNN) -- The mammoth flooding that has deluged much of Thailand, killing hundreds, appears to be subsiding. But steep challenges remain for displaced residents and migrant workers abandoned by their employers. The heavily industrial Samut Sakorn province employs hundreds of thousands of migrant workers from Myanmar, according to estimates from Thai and Myanmar officials. But when floodwaters overtook numerous factories in the area, some business owners simply fled -- leaving employees without their documents or pay. ""During the flood ... Myanmar workers are the second class, so the priority goes to the Thai workers,"" said Naing Tan, Myanmar's deputy ambassador to Thailand. One migrant worker, 20-year-old Nun Nwee Hlaing, painted toys at a toy factory in Samut Sakorn. She said she kept working when floodwaters covered her ankles, but when the water got chest-high, her boss took off without saying a word. Hlaing is now taking refuge at a temple in the town of Mahathai. On Monday, a Thai provincial official, the Myanmar diplomat and a priest at the temple met to discuss the refugees' plight and agreed to let migrant workers working legally in the country stay. Dechar Teuktattanaruk, head of the provincial employment office, said the government will try to find temporary work for them. But undocumented workers like Hlaing would have to go back to Myanmar. Elsewhere, in Pathum Thani province, dozens of area residents established makeshift homes in prefabricated cement shells intended for use in the construction of Bangkok's elevated skyway. The company that owns the forms has told their new occupants they can stay, and it's letting them tap into electric lines for light. Most of the forms' new residents are from the same flood-ravaged community a short boat ride away. Some floated with their most prized possessions with them. ""I own a small shop and when it started to flood, I moved all my goods to my house,"" said a woman named Jaew, who lives in a concrete form with her family of five. ""Then, a few days later, my house got flooded. And when the water was up to my neck, we moved here."" The deluge has killed 537 people, and 22 provinces remain affected, according to the Thai department of disaster prevention and mitigation. ""The latest flood situation has improved, (and the) water level in general has receded,"" Yingluck Shinawatra said on her Facebook page Monday. ""Diverting water into the sea can be done at (a) faster manner in the eastern part of Bangkok. In the west of Bangkok, draining water is slow, but the government has dredged canals to speed up draining water."" Bangkok's main airport, Suvarnabhumi Airport, is operating normally. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will visit Thailand on Wednesday during a three-day trip to southeast Asia and plans to visit flood-stricken areas in Bangkok, the U.N. said Monday. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report from Bangkok .","Prime Minister: The water level recedes, but draining in some areas are slow .

"London (CNN) -- For anyone arriving in Britain, it's obvious that the country is having a big, big party. There are Union Jack flags across the streets, bunting hangs from building to building and, in the stores, the shelves are crammed full of jubilee memorabilia. It's 115 years since Britain celebrated a diamond jubilee. The last monarch -- indeed the only previous monarch -- to have celebrated 60 years on the throne was Queen Elizabeth's great-great grandmother Victoria. There were huge celebrations back in 1897 as the queen rode through her capital in front of thousands of loyal subjects cheering her every inch of the way. On the queen's schedule that day was a trip to St. Paul's Cathedral for a service of thanksgiving. She was too frail to climb the steps outside Christopher Wren's great masterpiece, so instead the queen stayed in her carriage while the clergy and congregation came outside for the service. Spool on to 2012 and at her service of thanksgiving, Queen Elizabeth will stop exactly where Victoria's carriage came to a halt. This time though, the monarch will walk up the steps and make it into the cathedral. Live blog: Queen's Diamond Jubilee, June 3 . It wasn't until 1935 that the UK saw its next jubilee. As war clouds gathered over Europe, King George V and Queen Mary celebrated their Silver Jubilee to mark 25 years on the throne. Again, there were celebrations in London, around Britain and across the Empire. By the time of Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee in 1977, much was different. Deference to royalty had been replaced by respect and, in truth, some indifference. British colonial rule was almost gone: some newly independent countries kept the queen as head of state while others ditched her altogether in favor of a president. But most of these nations opted to join the Commonwealth, a club of countries all tied through history to the UK and the monarchy. Bumming a smoke from the queen: When the security bubble bursts . What hadn't changed much though was way the Brits showed their affection that year for their sovereign. Hundreds of thousands of people filled the streets of London to cheer the queen as she toured her capital, while millions more folks, including a 10-year-old me, took part in street parties up and down the land. It was the first jubilee in which I was actively involved. I remember doing projects at school about the royal family and also receiving my Silver Jubilee coin. I still have it. The Silver Jubilee was the first time I'd ever seen the queen: in fact it was the first time I'd ever seen any of the royal family. When Her Majesty came to my home town in northern England, I was part of a boys choir that sang for her. I can still remember part of the song -- but probably can't reach the high notes these days. How the world has changed in queen's reign . The Golden Jubilee 10 years ago marked the 50th anniversary of the queen's accession. It was an amazing event which, for me, holds so many wonderful memories. By then I'd become a journalist. In that capacity, I went to different parts of the country covering the queen's visits. I saw the extraordinary warmth with which she was greeting by so many of her subjects. And I was privileged to work on two concerts held for the queen in her garden at Buckingham Palace. The lineup read like a ""Who's Who"" of music from the previous 50 years. Not everything went according to plan though. I was in the palace garden talking to the musician Phil Collins when security staff came charging out of the building, telling us there was a fire. Surely this isn't going to be a repeat of the Windsor Castle fire in 1992 we thought -- and over the jubilee weekend as well? Thankfully, it turned out to be very small and caused minimal damage to some staff quarters -- but it was a heartstopping few minutes. Another abiding memory of 2002 was meeting the queen and being corrected on my English. I was introduced to her majesty at Windsor Castle. Her presence in a room full of people was huge, even though she's only 5 feet 4 inches tall. As we chatted, I thanked her for agreeing to change her schedule by a few minutes on one of her regional visits to help accommodate television coverage. Unfortunately, I used the American pronunciation ""skedule."" Looking back, I still wonder how on earth I could have dropped such a clanger. At least the queen was smiling as she set me straight! Spin on another 10 years to the Diamond Jubilee. There's huge excitement in Britain. Of course there are those who don't really care about the event and a small number of people who would rather there was no monarchy at all. But with the queen's popularity riding high, there's no doubt that people up and down the land will be joining in the festivities. In small villages, medium-sized towns and big cities, the jubilee buzz will be everywhere. And in London, expect to see more than a million people on the streets as the queen tours the city in her carriage. Of course, a big royal event like this wouldn't be complete without the balcony appearance -- and that wave, so uniquely royal. This will be the moment when people show how proud they are to have Elizabeth as their head of state. She's a symbol of continuity and stability in a fast-changing world. In times good and bad, the British look to their royal family. When she was 21, she made a broadcast in which she promised to devote the rest of her life to serving the people. Now it's the people's turn to acknowledge her contribution and say thank you. During this jubilee weekend, millions of people will sing the British national anthem, ""God Save The Queen."" And when they do, they'll really mean it. Are you going or celebrating the Diamond Jubilee in your own way? Let us know how in the comments!","Clark: Celebration will show how proud Brits are to have Elizabeth as their head of state .

"(CNN) -- The combination of Google's new storage service, Google Drive, and the company's recently unified terms of service and privacy policy, have riled the Internet into demanding to know why Google seemed to be claiming ownership of their customers' files. As it turns out, the company claims no ownership -- it says so right in the terms of service. And a comparison between Google Drive's terms and that of other storage services turns up few material differences, except for a couple of questionable terms that may land your content in Google's promotional materials. In a comparison piece, The Verge noted that the terms of service from four major cloud storage services -- Dropbox, iCloud, Microsoft SkyDrive, and Google Drive -- all claim no ownership of the files you give them. Several publishing outfits raised the alarm about a clause in Google's terms of service that states Google reserves the right to ""use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute"" content uploaded to their services. But as The Verge pointed out, other services have similarly expansive, and sometimes more expansive, terms, and those services mean only to use them in service of, well, the services. When we spoke to the Electronic Frontier Foundation about Google Drive's terms of service, the EFF found little about them that was more suspicious than in any other similar cloud service. But Rebecca Jeschke, EFF's media relations director and digital rights analyst, paused over one phrase: ""The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones."" Promoting? Google's unified privacy policy states that it won't use your material to do anything other than ""provide, maintain, protect and improve [its services], [and] to develop new ones,"" and will ask for consent before lending your material to any other uses. But if a file is set as publicly available, that is considered consent for use to promote Google's services. If a user uploads a photo and sets it as publicly viewable, that picture could end up in an ad for Google. The good news here is that Google isn't going to be strewing your personal files all over the Internet as banner ads, as the terms of service alone might suggest, provided the files have some privacy settings, as they do by default -- viewable only to friends, for instance. But a public file on any of Google's services could, in theory, end up in promotional materials. It makes some sense that public content could be used by others, but it's easy to forget how public ""Public"" on an Internet service is. It gives us flashbacks to the family photo posted on a blog that wound up in a Czech ad. Jeschke went on to point out that users should be more concerned with who Google might be forced to give their files to, than what Google itself might do with their files. ""In light of Megaupload, it's possible that users are worried about the wrong thing,"" she said. Files stored in the cloud can still be easily lost or subpoenaed without the users' knowledge, Jeschke noted, an issue that's often overlooked.

"(CNN)  -- Time magazine on Wednesday named Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke as its 2009 Person of the Year, calling him ""the most powerful nerd on the planet."" Bernanke will be featured on the cover of the magazine that hits stores Friday. He beat out Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, President Obama, Apple CEO Steve Jobs and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi among other finalists. Time said Bernanke was the reason the U.S. financial crisis wasn't worse. ""The story of the year was a weak economy that could have been much, much weaker. Thank the man who runs the Federal Reserve, our mild-mannered economic overlord,"" the article said. ""He didn't just reshape U.S. monetary policy; he led an effort to save the world economy."" Time: Person of the Year 2009 . Bernanke is considered a scholar of the Great Depression. A series of his writings were compiled into the book ""Essays of the Great Depression."" Michael Grunwald, who authored Time's article, on Wednesday told NBC's ""Today"" that ""basically [Bernanke] saw what looked like another depression coming, and he decided he would do whatever it takes to forestall that. And basically, I think he did. It could have been a lot worse."" Grunwald said, ""There are things that he could have done better. One of his responsibilities is for full employment in society, and he hasn't really stepped up on that, but basically in terms of influencing how the economy went this year, Bernanke was the guy."" The Time senior correspondent added, ""Look, he's been criticized from left and right, from liberals and conservatives, you know, for ... running the unelected fourth branch of government. He's a controversial figure."" Wednesday's announcement comes a day before a Senate Banking Committee vote on whether Bernanke should be given another term. ""Remember, he's a Republican appointed by a Democratic president. It's the Democrats on the committee that are going to vote to confirm. It's a really interesting combination of factors,"" Grunwald said. One of Bernanke's harshest critics is Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Kentucky, the only senator to vote against the economist's appointment four years ago by President Bush. In a statement Wednesday, Bunning said, ""I find it ironic that a man who has spent the last year rewarding others for failure is now being named 'Person of the Year.' ""But if Time magazine is in the business of rewarding failure, Ben Bernanke is their man -- he has certainly excelled at that."" Bunning called Bernanke a ""moral hazard,"" accusing him of supporting the ""easy money policies of his predecessor, Alan Greenspan,"" who made the cover of Time in February 1999, along with then-Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and his successor, Lawrence H. Summers. Another sharp critic of Bernanke, independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, said December 2 that he plans to place a ""hold"" on Bernanke's nomination for a second term once it leaves the Banking Committee. A ""hold"" is an informal practice in which a senator informs the majority leader that he or she does not want a bill or nomination to reach the floor for a vote. Majority leader Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nevada, would not need to act on Sanders' request, but Sanders could launch a filibuster to delay the motion to nominate the Fed chairman for another four-year term. ""The American people overwhelmingly voted last year for a change in our national priorities to put the interests of ordinary people ahead of the greed of Wall Street and the wealthy few,"" Sanders said then, explaining his action. ""What the American people did not bargain for was another four years for one of the key architects of the Bush economy."" Time magazine noted that Bernanke, who turned 56 Sunday, defies the stereotype of ""a typical Beltway power broker."" ""He doesn't have a commanding presence. He isn't a mesmerizing speaker. He has none of the look-at-me swagger or listen-to-me charisma so common among men with oversize Washington offices,"" the article said. Bernanke was sworn in as Federal Reserve chairman in February 2006. He spent years in academia, as a professor at Princeton, Stanford and New York universities and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, according to the Fed's Web site. Time magazine, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.","GOP senator and critic calls Ben Bernanke ""moral hazard""

"London (CNN) -- The Thames became a sea of red, white and blue Sunday, as tens of thousands celebrated the diamond jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II -- so perhaps it was only fitting that alongside all the flags, another great British tradition was very much in evidence: Gray skies and rain. Some 20,000 people took to the water aboard 1,000 vessels for a river pageant featuring dragon boats, a floating belfry and the royal barge. The event -- inspired by regal riverside celebrations of the past -- was the largest such celebration on the Thames for hundreds of years. Around a million people were expected to line the route to cheer on the queen, at the head of a seven-mile long flotilla. But bad weather meant a planned fly-past was canceled. Follow CNN's live blog . Isabella Hales and her family staked out their claim to a spot near Tower Bridge -- where the festivities reached a climax on Sunday evening. ""It's cold, but I don't mind,"" the 10 year old, wearing a cardboard Duchess of Cambridge mask that was rapidly dissolving in the drizzle, told CNN. ""It was raining for the queen's coronation too. I'm just really excited, I can't wait."" ""It's only the second time someone has reigned for 60 years,"" her aunt Laura Hales added. ""It's a big accomplishment, and we wanted to celebrate that. ""There are about 20 of us -- we've come well prepared,"" she said, pointing out picnic supplies, party masks of the royal family -- including a corgi -- and pink champagne, ""And we don't care what the weatherman says. ""Here's to Liz!"" she toasted, raising her glass. iReporters celebrate Queen Elizabeth II . Margaretta Soulsby, from Dorset, was the first to arrive at Tower Bridge on Saturday. She had planned to camp out, but when it began raining, stewards persuaded her to spend the night in a tent nearby. Soulsby told CNN it was ""well worth it -- I'm in the perfect position,"" and said such events made her very proud to be British. ""In 1935, when I was 10, my father took the family to The Mall to watch the silver jubilee celebrations for King George V and Queen Mary, and I've been privileged to be present at all of the major royal events since then."" After gathering upriver in west London, the flotilla made its way from Battersea Bridge to Tower Bridge, passing through the heart of Britain's capital city over the course of several hours. At the front were 300 man-powered boats, with thousands of volunteers propelling them down river, flags and streamers fluttering around them. A barge carrying the eight Royal Jubilee Bells -- the largest of which, at nearly half a ton, is named for the monarch -- led the way, with peals of bells ringing out from church towers along the river. Bumming a smoke from the queen: When the security bubble bursts . Next came passenger boats, pleasure boats, historic wooden vessels -- the oldest built in 1740 -- and boats carrying members of the armed forces, police and fire services. One of the boats taking part, the Amazon, also took part in the 1897 Diamond Jubilee celebrations for Queen Victoria, Britain's longest-serving monarch and the only other to reach the landmark 60 years on the throne. The biggest cheers were reserved for the present queen, who was carried aboard a specially-converted royal barge, opulently draped in red and gold. Sailing boats that were too tall to pass under the 14 bridges along the river pageant route lined the river from London Bridge to Wapping, in the east, creating an avenue of sails set against the Tower of London and the city's financial center. The queen disembarked at Tower Bridge and looked on as the remainder of the river pageant passed by in a riot of color and noise. Excitement grew as a gun salute rang out from the Tower of London. Nearby, those not lucky enough to get a riverside spot before the area was locked down, watched the pageant on a big screen. Cheers, whistles and the odd chorus of ""God Save the Queen"" rang out, and the crowd stayed jolly despite the rain. Helen McKee, from Kent, said she bought her family along to enjoy a once-in-a-lifetime spectacle. ""We're never going to see this sort of thing again. I've got a little boy and I thought it was important for him to see it. I still remember the Silver Jubilee in 1977. It's a great atmosphere here, everyone is so friendly."" To Jamie Newell, from London, events on the river were just a forerunner of the main attraction of the day - the after party he was planning at home. Newell, decked out from head to toe in Union flags, and sporting red, white and blue contact lenses, said simply: ""I love the queen."" Not everyone was of the same opinion. In a street behind the London Assembly building, scores of pro-republican campaigners had gathered, waving placards reading: ""Make monarchy history"" and ""Don't jubilee-ve it"" and chanting ""Monarchy out, republic in."" Today though, they seemed resigned to the fact that they were well and truly in the minority. As the queen's barge approached and Tower Bridge lifted in salute, red white and blue streamers were tossed from the crowd. And then, as if on cue, the heavens opened, rain lashing those gathered on the riverbanks below. Hoods and umbrellas went up, coats and ponchos went on, quickly followed by shouts of ""brolleys down"" from those behind. Some of those who had gathered fled to shelter, but others remained determined to see out the whole seven-mile flotilla, even in torrential rain. Patrick Gunning had been waiting for the flotilla since 11 a.m. on Sunday. It was well worth the wait, he said. ""I've had my son Saul, who's 8, on my shoulders so we saw the whole thing, and we'll be staying a little longer."" London's Metropolitan Police said as many as 6,000 extra officers were on patrol during jubilee events. The huge security operation comes as London prepares to host the 2012 Olympic Games, which open in late July. Outside the capital, Britons gathered for thousands of jubilee-themed street parties and barbecues Sunday. Stores have been filled for weeks with an array of patriotic paraphernalia, from flag-adorned teapots to aprons to picnic sets, to help hosts set the scene for what is billed as a national celebration. The celebrations continue on Monday and Tuesday, which have been declared public holidays to mark the diamond jubilee. An afternoon garden party at Buckingham Palace will be followed Monday evening by a televised pop concert outside the palace grounds. At the end of the concert, the queen will take to the stage to light the ""National Beacon,"" which will be on the Mall. She will use a diamond made from crystal glass, which has been on display at the Tower of London from the beginning of May, to light the flame. More than 4,000 beacons will then be lit in communities throughout the United Kingdom, along with the Commonwealth and UK Overseas Territories. Tuesday will be a day of pomp and ceremony, as the queen attends a service of thanksgiving at St. Paul's Cathedral, followed after lunch in Westminster by a carriage procession back to Buckingham Palace, where she will appear on the balcony, flanked by members of the royal family.","Diamond Jubilee of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II marked with river pageant .

"London, England (CNN) -- With a military band, a string orchestra and electric guitars on full blast, London's Buckingham Palace was transformed into a rock venue on Monday as some of the biggest names in music celebrated Queen Elizabeth II's diamond jubilee. Former Beatle Paul McCartney headlined a colorful evening of flag-waving entertainment that also saw Stevie Wonder, Elton John and Tom Jones take the stage alongside younger acts. The event was one of the highlights of four days of festivities that have united millions to honor the long-serving British monarch. As psychedelic illuminations and the reds, whites and blues of the Union Jack lit up the facade of the palace, McCartney played some of his greatest hits to an audience that included Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry, Prince Andrew and Princess Anne. The queen was also there having joined her family at the concert's midway point. Her husband, 90-year-old Prince Philip, did not attend the show as he had been hospitalized earlier in the day with a bladder infection. See also: Canaletto painting inspires royal knees-up . At the concert's climax the monarch, dressed in a gold gown, joined the cast of performers on stage to ignite the last in a sequence of beacons burning around the world -- a fiery salute to her 60 years on the throne. She used a symbolic crystal ""diamond"" to trigger a laser that ignited a ""national beacon"" as 4,200 celebration fires blazed in communities across the UK and Commonwealth nations as far away as New Zealand and Tonga. ""We are now celebrating the life and service of a very special person over the past 60 years,"" her son, Prince Charles told 18,000 ticket-holding guests, millions more watching on television and crowds packed into the nearby Mall thoroughfare. ""As a nation this is our opportunity to thank you and my father for always being there for us, for inspiring us with your selfless devotion to duty and for making us proud to be British."" Three rousing cheers and a deafening chorus of the British national anthem, ""God Save the Queen,"" then rang out as fireworks filled the air. Eyes of the world on spectacular Thames pageant . Artists representing pop, rock, classical and musical theater from every decade of her reign made appearances at Monday's concert. A few tailored their hits for the occasion. Elton John kicked off his set with ""I'm Still Standing,"" while Stevie Wonder's rendition of ""Isn't She Lovely"" featured lyrics paying tribute to the ""young 86-year-old"" queen. There were plenty of surprises as artists were given rare access to the royal residence and its surroundings. At one point, pop group Madness performed their hit ""Our House"" from the roof of Buckingham Palace. Earlier, operatic tenor Alfie Boe sang a duet with American soprano Renee Fleming from a palace balcony. In one of the show's more bizarre moments, Grace Jones sang her 1980s hit ""Slave to Rhythm"" while swinging a hula hoop on her hips. Read a review of the show . Another highlight included the performance of a song specially written by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and concert organizer Gary Barlow performed by 200 people from around the Commonwealth. Other acts playing at the concert included Annie Lennox, American rapper Will.i.am, and Australian singer Kylie Minogue. While she is no stranger to pop concerts thanks to her regular attendance at ""royal variety"" performances, it wasn't clear from her set expression whether the queen was enjoying the lineup. Some have suggested the sovereign's music tastes lean towards songs from musicals such as ""Oklahoma!."" According to British media reports, she wore earplugs at a similar event in 2002 to mark 50 years of her reign. iReporters celebrate Queen Elizabeth II . There were plenty of jokes on stage, but the queen reserved saved her smiles for the crowd and for quips made by Prince Charles about the weather which, after a weekend of rain, was dry for the duration of the concert.

"Washington (CNN) -- Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan took a pragmatic approach to the issue of late-term abortion when working as a top lawyer in the Clinton White House, documents released Friday show. The material was part of more than 46,000 pages released by the William J. Clinton Presidential Library. Kagan was a top lawyer in the administration's Office of Domestic Policy. At issue at the time was a bill in the Republican-controlled Congress that would ban a type of abortion performed in the second trimester. Critics of the procedure called it ""partial-birth"" abortion. In a February 27, 1997 memo to top White House staff, Kagan notes a leading abortion rights supporter had just admitted late-term abortions were being ""performed more frequently than pro-choice groups have acknowledged, and often perfonned [sic - performed] on healthy women with healthy fetuses,"" repeating a claim conservatives at the time had long made. Kagan advises ""it would be a great mistake to challenge"" the statements of Ron Fitzsimmons, then executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers. Nonetheless, Kagan said the controversy did not undermine the president's stated position that he would support the GOP bill with some exceptions. ""The president's position today remains what it has always been,"" wrote Kagan, ""that he will sign a bill banning partial-birth abortions, but only if it has an exception that will protect those women -- even if few in number -- who need this procedure to save their lives or prevent serious harm to their health."" The Supreme Court three years ago affirmed a similar federal ban on the procedure, passed by Congress in 2003. That bill did not include a ""health exception."" Kagan in her memos at the time repeatedly used the term ""partial-birth"" favored by anti-abortion groups and one which abortion-rights activists had tried to replace, believing it was inaccurate and inflammatory. The documents reveal another person heavily involved in the abortion issue: Rahm Emanuel, then a senior adviser in the Clinton White House. He is now President Obama's chief of staff. Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee have sought a delay in Kagan's confirmation hearings, scheduled for the week of June 28, saying this latest batch of documents gives them little time to learn about her views on hot-button social and legal issues. Some 160,000 pages of documents are being reviewed from Kagan's four-years in the Clinton White House from 1995-1999, during which she also served as deputy associate counsel. Papers from her time in that position will be released in coming days. Kagan also was heavily involved in negotiations to clamp down on the tobacco industry. The White House and Congress had sought a compromise to enact tough marketing restrictions, especially those aimed at young people. Kagan appeared to view her role in the Domestic policy office as both a lawyer and political adviser, worrying that both  Democrats and Republicans could back away from the legislation. In an April 1998 memo, she and her boss Bruce Reed told the president that ""we should not ask for more than we need to achieve our public health goals and in the process destroy any chance of industry acquiescence ... efforts to push the price too far would be counterproductive because tobacco-state Democrats will join with Republicans to derail a bill that goes as far as some in the public health community might like."" Both Reed and Kagan indirectly acknowledged such a middle-of-the road compromise approach would anger many members of the administration and liberal health reform advocates. Kagan, then 37, also noted proposals from within the administration might go too far and later be declared unconstitutional by the federal courts. ""I'm not sure I buy the argument"" made by other White House officials that First Amendment free speech concerns would not become a barrier to passage of the bill, she noted in her own handwriting on one memo. It was part of a draft letter to a Republican senator and dealt with her view the tobacco industry should unilaterally promote voluntary advertising limits. ""We should enable the companies to agree on this,"" wrote Kagan. Kagan was nominated in May by President Barack Obama to succeed the retiring Justice John Paul Stevens. Until she she stepped down last month, Kagan was the administration's solicitor general, which argues federal government cases before the Supreme Court. She has no judicial experience, and conservative critics have been eagerly scanning her past record in government service and academia for clues on what kind of justice she may turn out be, if confirmed by the Senate. ""As we suspected, President Obama nominated a far left liberal who supports both abortion and 'gay marriage,'"" said Penny Nance, CEO of Concerned Women for America. ""Elena Kagan has also demonstrated her disdain for the unborn, the most vulnerable in our society."" On affirmative action, Kagan weighed in on a pending Supreme Court challenge by a white teacher in New Jersey who had been fired in favor of a black teacher, when both had equal seniority. The Bush administration in 1992 had filed suit in support of the white teacher, saying she had been a victim of discrimination on account of race, in violation of federal law. At the time, the Clinton administration had to decide whether to continue the legal challenge in federal courts. Then-Solicitor General Walter Dellinger noted the language of his legal brief to the justices ""is a sensitive one."" The administration decided to support the white teacher on narrow grounds, that in this case the school board failed to offer an adequate justification for the public employee's dismissal. Kagan supported that view, but she and others in the Clinton White House also wanted to clarify that race-based decisions were sometimes justified in the name of diversity -- ""to mend (without ending) affirmative action."" ""I think this is exactly the right position,"" wrote Kagan in the margins of the Solicitor General's memo, ""as a legal matter, as a policy matter, and as a political matter."" She signed it ""Elena.""","46,000 pages released by William J. Clinton Library .

"Washington (CNN) -- Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan once believed a federal law to ban physician-assisted suicide was a ""fairly terrible idea."" The handwritten remarks were part of more than 46,000 documents released Friday, as Senate lawmakers prepare for confirmation hearings for the 50-year-old Kagan. The memos detailed Kagan's service in President Bill Clinton's Domestic Policy Council, which advised the White House inner circle on a range of issues pending in Congress and the courts. As deputy to then director Bruce Reed, Kagan offered legal and political advice on an agenda that included abortion, tobacco legislation, AIDS, consumer protections and healthcare. At issue was a federal challenge to Oregon's 1994 Death with Dignity Act allowing doctors to prescribe lethal doses of medicine to assist patients to commit suicide. The law, which passed a state referendum by a slim margin, survived multiple court challenges and attempts to blunt its effectiveness, including a second referendum in 1997 that would have repealed it. Sixty percent of Oregon's voters rejected the repeal attempt. But in early 1998, the Clinton administration was prepared to support the argument that Oregon's referendum was acceptable and that federal authorities had no power -- under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) -- to block doctors from prescribing lethal doses of drugs. In a January 16, 1998, memo from the Justice Department, Clinton officials laid out their case, despite internal concerns the law was an improper preemption of federal power. At the top of the document, Kagan added her thoughts. ""DOJ [Justice Department] is ready to opine that Oregon doctors who assist suicides are not violating the Controlled Substances Act (This is contrary to an initial DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] ruling,"" wrote Kagan. ""We need to decide whether to accompany this ruling with a request for new legislation making assisted suicide a federal crime. I think this is a fairly terrible idea, but I know Begala likes it."" Kagan, in the memo, does not specify why she opposed that idea. ""Begala"" is Paul Begala, a longtime Clinton political adviser. He is now a political contributor for CNN and a Democratic party strategist. She signed her remarks with ""Elena."" Conservative groups expressed initial concern over this and other memos outlining Kagan's often blunt views on hot-button issues. ""It shows her as a political thinker, which was her role at the time,"" said Carrie Severino of the Judicial Crisis Network. ""But as someone who has never been a judge, it is something to look out for, if her approach on the bench will be politically driven. It can be hard to change that role, to become a fair arbiter of the law and not be a judicial activist."" The high court the year before the Kagan memo upheld state bans on assisted suicide, concluding there was nothing in the Constitution supporting an individual's right to die. But the ruling left open the possibility of state referendums supporting the practice, and Oregon's measure went into effect after numerous appeals and injunctions. The Bush administration in the 2000s -- backed by a Republican-led Congress -- vigorously took up the issue to make assisted suicide a federal crime and to challenge the Oregon law, eventually appealing all the way to the Supreme Court. The justices in January 2006 ruled against the federal government, dismissing the argument the U.S. attorney general has the power to block Oregon's then-unique law. Medical groups and patient right advocates supported Oregon, while many religious conservatives backed the Bush administration.","Kagan memo on doctor-assisted suicide part of 46,000 documents from Clinton years .

"(CNN) -- Newly elected Egyptian ministers held their first parliamentary session this week, almost a year to the day after the start of historic protests in the capital led to the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. But for all the bravery and resilience the demonstrators showed by withstanding a brutal crackdown as they sang, waved flags and held candlelight vigils for 18 days, the movement began many years before. ""Being in the square, just feeling that energy, was one of the greatest experiences of my life,"" said Ashraf Khalil, an Egyptian-American journalist who was standing among the protesters when news broke February 11 that Mubarak had decided to resign. ""It felt like a roar but also a kind of relief, an enormous release of years of frustration and struggle."" In his new book, ""Liberation Square: Inside the Egyptian Revolution and the Rebirth of a Nation,"" Khalil explains some of the events that quietly laid the foundation for the uprising. He also predicts what may be ahead for Egypt in 2012 as unprecedented elections take place, likely prompting more protests and violence. ""There's one camp that's throwing up their hands and saying, 'Oh, the revolution hasn't brought us anything,' "" Khalil said. Are you there? Share your thoughts on the anniversary of the uprising. But many Egyptians, particularly older, experienced activists who lived through decades of oppression under Mubarak's rule, are far more optimistic. ""They argue that this process, as messy as it may be, is a victory in itself,"" he said. ""This is a generation that believes this is democracy in progress."" Khalil's parents emigrated from Egypt in the late 1960s to get their doctorate degrees in the United States. In their home in suburban Chicago, his parents spoke Arabic, but Khalil picked up almost none of it. But as he got older and considered becoming a journalist, he yearned to know more about his family's background and more about Egypt. While studying at Indiana University, he went to Cairo for a year on a study-abroad program. ""I got the place in my blood and always thought about coming back,"" he recalled. After graduation and a few years at a newspaper in Indiana, Khalil moved to Cairo in 1997 to work as a freelance reporter. He had barely unpacked his bags and settled in when a terrorist attack turned the world's focus on Egypt. Fifty-eight foreign tourists were killed when Islamist gunmen invaded a poorly guarded temple across the River Nile from Luxor. The Luxor massacre, Khalil writes, was an important first stone in the path to January 2011. It crippled whatever sympathy some Egyptians might have had toward Islamic militant groups, and it launched the career of Habib al-Adly, who became interior minister under Mubarak. Photos: Looking back at Egypt's uprising . At the time of the Luxor massacre, Egyptian police were given a blank check to go after Islamist groups. But the force also became something much darker, an ""unchecked and unchallenged"" authority that bullied Egyptians of all backgrounds. The police spied on and intimidated newspaper editors, business leaders, university professors and judges. ""You heard anger boiling up about the police from every corner of Egyptian life, but it was hushed because there was such intense fear,"" Khalil said. Al-Adly is believed to be Mubarak's right-hand man in the security forces' violent actions against protesters. Despite being beaten, tear-gassed and shot at, demonstrators rallied, specifically demanding al-Adly's dismissal. In February, just weeks after Mubarak was ousted, Egypt froze al-Adly's bank accounts, banned him from traveling and arrested him. He was sentenced in May to 12 years in prison for money laundering and abuse of office. Mubarak, meanwhile, is on trial in Egypt, accused of corruption and ordering the deaths of protesters. The former president suddenly fell ill after his resignation. Watching him get wheeled into the courtroom on a stretcher, Khalil is reminded of the Mubarak of 1999, who ran an over-the-top campaign to remain in office. It was a joke, the journalist said, because Mubarak was the only candidate on the ticket. ""I was witness to so many fake elections, but (this election) was like Stanlinist level of worship, like something you'd see in North Korea. All the billboards and the newspapers were filled with (photos and editorials) venerating this guy,"" Khalil said. ""It didn't reflect the way people really felt."" The propaganda was all the more fascinating because it served as a backdrop for small protests against the regime that popped up throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s. Several took place on Cairo University's campus. The demonstrations focused on foreign policy issues involving Israel, and government security quickly disbanded them. Those moments of protest never caught on in other parts of the country, or gelled much with anyone outside the university, because the demonstrators failed to agree on a unified message, Khalil writes. Some wanted to call out Mubarak by name, while others profoundly feared doing that. Islamist protesters wanted the focus to remain entirely on Israel, leaving the president out of it. 2011's uprising was successful, many observers agreed, because demonstrators were on the same page about what they wanted and how to get it. ""Liberation Square"" delves into a forgotten but highly significant footnote in the protests in Egypt. On the night that the United States led the invasion of Iraq in 2003, a crowd gathered in Tahrir Square to rally against Mubarak's allowing U.S. ships to take position in the Suez Canal. Against the odds, the demonstrators overwhelmed security forces sent to disperse them and tore down a huge poster of Mubarak outside an office of his National Democratic Party. Wael Khalil, a longtime Egyptian activist who helped fuel 2011's movement, was at that rally. He remembers the night in ""Liberation Square."" ""The tone of anti-Mubarak sentiment and the focus on the question of democracy really started then,"" Wael Khalil said. ""It started with 'Down with America' and turned to 'Down with Mubarak.' "" For the rest of the decade, there were more fits and starts of protests and crackdowns while dissident expression took root in the arts and pop culture. Disgust with the regime's enforcement of sexual purity was mocked by a farcical movie that became an underground hit about young people going around Cairo trying to find a secret place to watch a porno. A novel that mocked Egypt's class system became a best-seller and was made into a film. But the tipping point for 2011's revolution came just as it had in the preceding Tunisian revolution: with the death of a young person pushed to extraordinary action. Khaled Said, a 28-year-old computer wiz, was arrested in June 2010 by Egyptian police while he sat at an Internet cafÃ© in Alexandria. Witnesses said police beat him to death. A postmortem picture of his mangled face was posted on the Web and went viral. ""Liberation Square"" includes intimate interviews with Said's close friends, activists inspired by his death, witnesses to the night Said died and bloggers who repeatedly posted a picture of a living, handsome Said next to his morgue photo. In October, two Egyptian police officers were found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to seven years for Said's death. The pictures of Said are still fresh in most Egyptians' memory. ""I think a lot of Egyptians are just exhausted. They are weary. They are realizing this is the first year mark of a 10-year process,"" Khalil said. ""But what they did, and what they want to do, is still clear."" Khalil says elections in 2012 will almost certainly inspire more protests and clashes between authorities and the people, seen most vividly in November and December. Economically, Egyptians will continue to struggle as tourism and foreign investment wanes. ""There shouldn't be a rush to decide what will happen in Egypt,"" he said. ""I'm confident, and I think Tahrir showed us, that Egyptians have an incredible determination to get it right.""","One year ago January 25, protesters began gathering in Tahrir Square .

"(CNN) -- Jorge Lorenza kickstarted his MotoGP title defense on Sunday as he won the Italian Grand Prix for the third year in a row. The Spanish motorcyclist overtook pole sitter Dani Pedrosa at the first corner at Mugello and never surrendered the lead as he trimmed his rival's championship advantage to 12 points after five races. ""I knew it was going to be a really hard race because it got much hotter than it had been in the morning,"" Lorenzo told the MotoGP website. ""Dani was following me for about 13 laps, but on the 13th I pushed a little bit more -- to be about three-tenths faster -- and it seems he gave up a little bit, so it was much easier from then."" Pedrosa had to fight off his rookie Honda teammate Marc Marquez, who dropped to third in the standings after suffering another one of the crashes that had marred his practice and qualifying sessions -- and this time ended his race. Pedrosa claimed second place ahead of Britain's Cal Crutchlow, with German rider Stefan Bradl fourth to match his best career result. ""I didn't feel fully comfortable in the race today, but I'm happy because I was able to gain a large number of points,"" said Pedrosa, who had won the two previous races in his native Spain and France, and was second at Mugello last year. ""In general, this was a difficult weekend. The back tire was giving me a lot of problems with grip but taking 20 points from this race and maintaining the lead the World Championship is something positive."" Marquez had been aiming to become the first newcomer to finish on the podium in the first five races of a season, but he suffered his seventh crash since stepping up to motorcycling's elite division. ""After three difficult days of setbacks and hard work, I finally felt good during the race,"" said the 20-year-old, who dropped 26 points behind Pedrosa. ""I don't fully understand why I crashed, as I lost both the front and the back at the same time and was unable to save it. It's clear that we made a mistake, but we can't go looking for excuses. ""We can't forget that this is my first year in the class and I am here to learn how things are in MotoGP. In spite of everything we were still fighting for second place, which is a reason to be happy."" Lorenzo's Yamaha teammate Valentino Rossi was another casualty, with Italy's seven-time world champion retiring only three corners into the race after being hit by Alvaro Bautista. Rossi's previous team Ducati gave the home fans something to cheer as Andrea Dovizioso, Nicky Hayden and Michele Pirro were fifth, sixth and seventh respectively. The sixth race of 18 this season is the Catalunya Grand Prix in Barcelona in a fortnight.","World motorcycling champion Jorge Lorenzo wins at Mugello for third successive year .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The body of a United Nations worker, who had been missing for 24 years, has been found in eastern Lebanon, a representative of United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Monday. Alec Collett was on assignment for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA, when he was kidnapped in Lebanon in 1985. The British national was 63 years old at the time. ""Although he is saddened by Alec Collett's death, he hopes that the actions taken to find his remains can provide a measure of comfort to his loved ones,"" the statement from Ban's representative said. Collett's abductors released two videotapes during his first year in captivity, in which Collett sent messages to his family, according to the U.N. In April 1986, a Beirut television station received a videotape that purportedly showed Collett being hanged, but the United Nations said it was impossible to formally identify whether or not it was him. Since then, nothing further had been heard about Collett's fate, despite repeated requests, the U.N. said. Collett had been visiting various UNRWA operations in Lebanon as part of a three-month consultancy mission when he was kidnapped on March 25, 1985 in the midst of Lebanon's civil war while riding in a car near the Beirut airport, according to the U.N. His driver, an Austrian national, was also abducted, but later released. Collett was the first U.N. employee to be kidnapped in Lebanon. A group calling itself the ""Revolutionary Organization of Muslim Socialists"" claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. In the months that followed, several other UNRWA staff members were kidnapped, but later released. Collett was married to an American, Elaine Collett, and their son Karim was 11 years old at the time of his kidnapping. During his 35-year career as a journalist, Collett worked in Prague as a newspaper correspondent for several British publications after World War II, as well as an Associated Press reporter in New York and at the United Nations.","Alec Collett had been visiting various UNRWA operations in Lebanon when he was kidnapped in March 1985 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Senate Democrats proposed a $110 billion measure Thursday to put off mandatory across-the-board spending cuts set to take effect March 1. The package made public by Senate Democratic leaders calls for replacing the so-called sequester cuts with a combination of increased tax revenue from millionaires, ending agriculture subsidies and reducing defense spending after the war in Afghanistan ends. Republican leaders in Congress have demanded that Democrats come up with a plan for avoiding the imminent cuts, technically known as sequestration. However, the GOP opposes any increase in tax rates or other steps to bring in more tax revenue, saying the nation needs to reduce the cost of government. Kerry: Cuts would hit foreign aid, diplomatic security . ""I would respectfully disagree that the American people are going to suddenly demand more tax hikes,"" an aide to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said. A White House statement said that opposing what it called the balanced plan by Senate Democrats would amount to prioritizing ""tax loopholes that benefit the very few at the expense of middle- and working-class Americans."" The issue extends a long-running political dispute over government spending and federal deficits that dominated President Barack Obama's first term, as well as his successful re-election campaign last year. Republicans were forced to concede on their steadfast opposition to increased taxes by agreeing in January to higher rates on top income earners as part of a deal to avoid some of the harshest impacts of what was known as the fiscal cliff, which included the sequester cuts and automatic tax hikes. Napolitano: Spending cuts will hurt homeland security . That agreement put off action on the sequester cuts, which were mandated by a 2011 agreement to raise the federal debt ceiling. The purpose of the deep cuts to all discretionary programs and the military was to motivate Congress to reach a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement that would replace it. However, such a deal has proved impossible, leading to the imminent application of $85 billion in spending cuts for 2013 and almost $1 trillion over 10 years. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and other officials warn that the cuts will have a dire impact on government operations and military readiness. The Pentagon would absorb about half of the reductions. While the White House and congressional leaders from both parties oppose sequestration, the approach for averting it has become the latest congressional showdown involving ideological differences over the size and role of government. House Speaker John Boehner noted on Thursday that the House passed bills last year to prevent the cuts from affecting the military, but Senate Democrats never acted. ""Those days are over,"" Boehner declared, but he also signaled a willingness to negotiate with the Senate over any legislation it sends over. ""It's time for the Senate to do their work. We can ... if they're willing to pass a bill, we'll find some way to work with them to address this problem."" Panetta: World is watching U.S. on budget . The plan unveiled Thursday by Senate Democrats would just replace the cuts through the end of this year, leaving time for possible negotiations on a broader deficit-reduction package that would eliminate sequestration entirely. The Democrats proposed $54 billion in revenue by implementing the ""Buffett rule,"" a principle by billionaire financier Warren Buffett that he shouldn't pay a lower tax rate than his secretary. Under it, anyone with adjusted income of more than $1 million after charitable deductions would pay a minimum 30% tax rate. Other revenue measures in the package include ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and closing tax loopholes for the oil industry. In addition, the package would cut military funding starting in 2015, following the planned end of U.S. combat operations next year in Afghanistan. It would also end agriculture subsidies for a total saving of $55 billion. ""Billions in direct payment subsidies are paid out even in good times and for crops farmers aren't even growing,"" explained Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, who chairs the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry. Panetta said Wednesday that Congress needs to put aside party and ideological divisions that he called ""the greatest concern I have for our national security."" He expressed concern over how the world will view the United States if it fails to avert sequestration. ""What (other countries) worry about is what I worry about, which is whether or not we can govern and whether or not we can face the tough decisions that have to be made and resolve those,"" Panetta said.

"(CNN) -- The New England Patriots will open the door to the media at 10:15 Tuesday morning. That line likely will be a lot longer than usual. With multiple media reports saying Tim Tebow is set to sign with the team, there will be many reporters angling for their first look at the polarizing backup quarterback in a new jersey. NFL.com, ESPN and other media outfits cited league sources in saying the 25-year-old former Heisman Trophy winner had come to terms with the Patriots on Monday. ESPN reported Tebow is expected to join the Patriots for a mandatory three-day training camp in Foxborough, Massachusetts. The Patriots declined to comment on the rumor, saying head coach Bill Belichick would have a 10:45 a.m. news conference. ""I am sure it will be addressed then,"" team spokesman Stacey James wrote in an e-mail. In three NFL seasons, Tebow, who was waived by the New York Jets in April, has played 35 games and completed 48% of his passes. He has been praised and panned for being outspoken about his Christian faith, including taking a prayerful position at games that has led to a Internet photo craze known as ""Tebowing."" Critics have said he doesn't throw well enough to be an NFL quarterback. If he does sign with the Patriots, he will be reunited with offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, who was the head coach of the Denver Broncos when they drafted Tebow in the first round in 2010. He will also get an opportunity to learn from starting quarterback Tom Brady, who in 14 years has won three Super Bowls and been the NFL's most valuable player twice. Tebow played for the New York Jets in 2012, rarely taking snaps but sometimes playing other positions in specialty formations on offense. He also played on the punting unit. The Patriots released Mike Kafka, a backup quarterback, on Monday. NFL players often have to pass a physical before they sign with a team.","Tim Tebow has been praised, criticized for showing his Christian faith .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North and South Korea said their naval forces clashed Tuesday in disputed waters, and each blamed the other for what is the first such violent incident in seven years. South Korean Rear Adm. Lee Ki Sik said the nation's forces issued three verbal warnings to a ship from the Communist north once it had crossed a demarcation line late Tuesday morning. The South Koreans then fired a warning shot, but when the North Korean vessel continued southward, the South Koreans opened fire. Lee said the North Koreans returned fire before heading back, their ship damaged in the exchange. North Korea, however, defended its actions. The patrol boat was on ""routine guard,"" according to a North Korean army report cited by the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), and the incident occurred because of ""provocation perpetrated by the South Korean forces in the waters of the north side."" ""The South Korean military authorities should make an apology to the North side for the armed provocation and take a responsible measure against the recurrence of the similar provocation,"" said the report. Lee said there were no South Korean casualties, and the North Koreans report didn't mention any casualties in the clash, which occurred off the Korean peninsula's western coast. Another South Korean official told the nation's semi-official Yonhap News Agency that South Korea was not ruling out ""the possibility that the clash may have been accidental."" However, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak convened an emergency security meeting and urged the military to ensure that the naval clash did not escalate into something greater, Yonhap reported. U.S. reaction was muted. In a briefing aboard Air Force One, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said, ""I would say to the North Koreans that we hope that there will be no further action in the Yellow Sea that could be seen as an escalation."" The naval skirmish comes just days after North Korea pressed for direct talks with the United States, saying the two need to settle their differences before meaningful multilateral nuclear discussions can proceed, state media reported. The reclusive Communist state pulled out of nuclear talks in April to protest the United Nations' condemnation of its nuclear test and missile launches. It has accused Washington of violating its sovereignty by singling it out and reporting it to the United Nations Security Council. President Obama is scheduled to visit South Korea next week on a trip to Asia that he begins on Thursday. North Korea will be one of the main issues to be discussed during the tour -- which also will take the president to Japan, China, and Singapore. North and South Korea have been bitterly divided since the 1950-53 war between them ended without a peace treaty. There was, however, an armistice with the U.N. Command establishing the Northern Limit Line (NLL), a demarcation on the Yellow Sea designed to avert clashes at sea. But the two nations dispute the exact location of the sea border, and North Korea does not observe the line. Clashes have occurred before in the Yellow Sea, especially during crab fishing season, according to the defense news Web site Globalsecurity.org. Since 2001, North Korean vessels have crossed the NLL 65 times -- 22 were this year -- though most of these incidents do not turn violent. The first clash since the Korean War that turned deadly took place in June 1999 when a North Korean ship was sunk. And in 2002, a series of North Korean incursions sparked an exchange that killed six South Korean sailors and wounded nine others.","South Korea issued three verbal warnings, defense official says .

A coalition of rebels ousted the Central African Republic's president, Francois Bozize, last month, the latest in a series of coups since the nation gained independence from France in 1960. Last year, several rebel groups under the umbrella name of Seleka started seizing parts of the country. In January, the rebels and the government brokered a peace deal that included a cease-fire and an agreement to form a unity government led by Bozize. But that deal fell apart as the rebel coalition pushed its way from its base in the north toward Bangui, seizing towns along the way. The U.N. refugee agency said it is working with authorities in the countries where the refugees are arriving to provide protection and assistance. UNHCR teams are distributing aid and setting up emergency shelters, Edwards said. ""Many left their homes in a hurry and were unable to bring personal belongings with them. People are either without places to live or being accommodated by local families -- who themselves live in extreme poverty,"" Edwards said.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Hundreds of thousands of protesters flooded Hong Kong's streets Sunday, shortly after the city's new chief executive was sworn in during a ceremony with Chinese President Hu Jintao on the 15th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty. Despite the humid weather, organizers reported that 400,000 protesters turned out for the annual July 1 protest against what they say is the ever-encroaching hand of the Chinese central government in the city's affairs and freedoms. It was the largest turnout since the estimated 500,000 protesters who marked the same date in 2003. Police put the figure at a much lower 63,000 people. The march capped a weekend of opposition to the appointment of Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying â€” also known as C.Y. Leung -- who was voted in by an electoral college of 1,200 influential figures in Hong Kong with Beijing's approval, as well as the suspicious death of Tiananmen dissident Li Wangyang. These recent flashpoints topped the list of ongoing grievances about the lack of universal suffrage, soaring housing prices, worsening pollution and a growing wealth gap. Amid megaphone-led chants for Leung to ""step down"" and myriad banners and costumes mocking Leung as a cunning ""wolf,"" some protesters waved the former Hong Kong flag used under British rule -- a gesture used to symbolize the erosion of the city's freedoms following the 1997 handover. Other protesters used images of the Hello Kitty cartoon to mock Leung's claim that Hello Kitty stickers in his home showed that previous tenants were responsible for his home's illegal â€” and highly controversial -- building structures, which came to light last week. Draping a Hello Kitty sash across his chest, Hong Kong artist Kacey Wong steered an all-pink army tank labeled as the ""cultural bureau,"" mocking Leung's proposed new government department. See photos of the July 1 march . Significantly, Leung's swearing-in ceremony on Sunday was fully conducted in Mandarin rather than the local Cantonese language, a move that did not go unnoticed by citizens sensitive about the encroachment of China's national language in Hong Kong. ""How completely alienating. If we have to watch a leader we didn't elect get sworn in, we could at least have it conducted in our own language,"" tweeted user @supercharz, Charmaine Mok. Leung ignored reporters' requests for comment about the protests as he exited the ceremony. The carefully orchestrated ceremony was interrupted during Hu's remarks by a heckler who shouted slogans calling for a redressing of the Tiananmen Square massacre and the establishment of a democratic Chinese nation before he was bundled out by security. The ceremony capped Hu's three-day visit to Hong Kong. Hu left the city before the July 1 march commenced at 3 p.m. local time. However, hundreds of protesters gathered outside Hu's hotel on Saturday, where they were enclosed within unusually high barricades that towered more than 2 meters high, which had not been used in Hong Kong since World Trade Organization protests in 2005. Several protesters and journalists were pepper-sprayed in the scuffle. During Hu's tour at the Kai Tak cruise terminal the same day, an Apple Daily reporter who yelled out a question about the Tiananmen Square massacre was removed by police from the press area and questioned under a stairwell. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong protests went unmentioned in the extensive coverage of the handover anniversary presented by Chinese state-run television station CCTV and news agency Xinhua. CNN's television broadcasts about the handover anniversary in Hong Kong were blacked out in mainland China on Sunday and Monday, while BBC World's coverage was also censored after it veered from Leung's inauguration remarks to mentioning concurrent protests. A photo circulating widely online Sunday picturing fireworks exploding in Victoria Harbor over the heads of protesters captured the divide between the government's representation of the sentiment surrounding the handover anniversary and the discontent brewing amid many citizens. In a statement addressing the July 1 march, the Hong Kong government said it ""fully respected people's rights to take part in processions and their freedom of expression and would listen to their views in a humble manner."" It went on to say that the government will ""uphold the core values of Hong Kong and protect the freedom and rights of the people.""","Organizers reported turnout of 400,000 for annual July 1 protest in Hong Kong .

"Toulouse, France (CNN) -- The French police siege to capture a suspected al Qaeda-trained militant came to a bloody end Thursday morning when commandos shot Mohammed Merah in the head as he fired wildly back at them, authorities said. Merah emerged from a bathroom in his apartment and fired more than 30 shots at police as they burst in to end a standoff that had lasted more than 31 hours, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said. He jumped out a window onto a balcony, still shooting, and was found dead on the ground, officials said. Two police officers were injured in the raid, Interior Minister Claude Gueant said. Merah had only two bullets left in his gun when he was killed, Molins said. Merah, 23, was wanted in the killings of three French paratroopers, a rabbi and three children ages 4, 5, and 7. The shootings began March 11 and ended Monday with the slaying of the rabbi and the children at a Jewish school in Toulouse. Authorities said the young man cited a variety of reasons for the killings, including France's ban on the wearing of Islamic veils, the missions of its troops abroad and the oppression of Palestinians. Police found video recordings of the attacks, ammunition and ingredients for explosives after he was killed, Molins said. In the video of the first shooting of a French soldier in Toulouse, Merah told the soldier, ""You kill my brothers, I kill you,"" Molins told reporters. Another video shows Merah gunning down two more French soldiers in Montauban. He is heard saying ""Allahu Akbar,"" or God is great, Molins said. Merah claimed to have posted the videos online, but police do not know when, where or how, Molins added. Merah was wearing a bulletproof vest when police raided his apartment, the prosecutor said. He originally said he would surrender to police, Gueant said, but later vowed that he would resist and kill anyone who tried to take him into custody. Gueant had said earlier police wanted to capture him alive, saying the priority was ""to hand him over to the authorities."" Merah said he wanted to ""die with weapons in his hands,"" Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet said overnight. After Merah's death, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said everything had been done to bring him to justice alive. But, he said, security forces could not be exposed to more danger as they sought to arrest him, since enough lives had already been lost. Sarkozy's political rival, Socialist presidential candidate Francois Hollande, congratulated police and said France had always shown that it ""knows how to stand up against its worst enemies without losing any of its values."" Campaigning for the French presidential elections, put on hold after the Toulouse school attack, has now resumed, with Sarkozy holding a rally in Strasbourg Thursday afternoon. The first round of voting is due next month. Sarkozy told supporters that his thoughts were with the victims and their families. The shootings were not the crime of a madman but of ""a monster and a fanatic,"" he said, and his crimes are ""inexplicable and inexcusable."" France is not racist or anti-Semitic, Sarkozy added, and the tragic events of the past few days have shown that the nation is stronger when it is united and lives by its values. Police had surrounded Merah's house at 3:30 a.m. Wednesday, having tracked him down through computer sleuthing and clues linked to his motorcycle, authorities said. As police first attempted to seize him early Wednesday morning, Merah shot and wounded two officers, said Molins, the prosecutor. The prosecutor said Merah had trained with al Qaeda in Pakistan's Waziristan region, bordering Afghanistan, and also spent time in Afghanistan. He was sent back to France after Afghan police picked him up at a traffic stop and alerted international forces to his presence, Molins said. Merah's activities led to his inclusion on the U.S. no-fly list, a U.S. intelligence official confirmed Thursday. Merah had been on the list for some time, one reason being that he had attended an al Qaeda training camp, the official said. Christian Etelin, a lawyer who represented Merah in an earlier incident involving a traffic accident, also said Merah went to Afghanistan two years ago. After the suspect's death, Etelin said that Merah was psychologically damaged. ""He was completely cut off from reality,"" Etelin said on CNN affiliate BFM-TV. Ebba Kalondo, the senior news editor of the television network France 24, told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" earlier that the suspect called her about two hours before police surrounded his home and laid out details of the killings that only police would have known -- ""very, very specific information"" such as the number of shots fired and the shell casings left behind. ""He seemed to be very aware that a massive manhunt was under way for him,"" Kalondo said. ""He said he wasn't scared, and that neither capture nor death scared him at all."" Officials worry about 'lone wolf' terrorists . Merah had been under surveillance by French intelligence for years, Interior Minister Gueant said. He had ""already committed certain infractions, some with violence,"" Gueant said. Merah was sentenced 15 times by a Toulouse juvenile court when he was a minor, Molins said. The French defense ministry said Merah had twice tried to join the French military. His first attempt was in the northern city of Lille, where he was refused because of prior convictions, and his second, in July 2010, was in Toulouse, where he sought to join the Foreign Legion but left during the first round of tests. Who is Mohammed Merah? Merah was born in Toulouse, said Elisabeth Allanic, a magistrate at the Paris prosecutors office. Gueant said he was of Algerian origin. Gueant said Merah ""wanted to avenge Palestinian children and take revenge on the French army because of its foreign interventions."" France has about 4,000 troops supporting the NATO mission in Afghanistan. The government has said it will pull them out by 2013. Merah also was opposed to France's recent move to ban women from wearing a full veil, Molins said. Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad strongly rejected using his people as a justification for the French killings, calling the string of shootings a ""cowardly terrorist attack."" Merah belonged to a group called Forsane Alizza, or Knights of Glory, Gueant said. The French government banned the group in January for trying to recruit people to fight in Afghanistan. The group issued a ""chilling warning"" on its Facebook page before it was banned this year, calling on supporters to attack Americans, Jews and French soldiers, terror expert Sajjan Gohel said. Police tracked Merah down via his brother's computer IP address, which was apparently used to respond to an ad posted by the first victim, Gueant said. In that first shooting, Imad Ibn Ziaten, a paratrooper of North African origin, arranged to meet a man in Toulouse who wanted to buy a scooter Ziaten had advertised online, the interior minister said. The victim said in the ad that he was in the military. A message sent from the suspect's brother's IP address was used to set up the March 11 appointment, at which the paratrooper was killed, Gueant said. Four days later, two other soldiers were shot dead and another injured by a black-clad man wearing a motorcycle helmet in a shopping center in the city of Montauban, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Toulouse. In the attack at the private Jewish school Ozar Hatorah on Monday, a man wearing a motorcycle helmet and driving a motor scooter pulled up and shot a teacher and three children -- two of them the teacher's young sons -- in the head. The other victim, the daughter of the school's director, was killed in front of her father. Police, who said the same guns were used in all three attacks, launched an intense manhunt and late Tuesday night zeroed in on the apartment, about 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) from the Jewish school. CNN's Pierre Meilhan, Carol Cratty, Dan Rivers, Stephanie Halasz, Dheepthi Namasivayam, Anna Pritchard and Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.","Mohammed Merah was on the U.S. no-fly list, a U.S. intelligence official says .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Two people died in clashes in western Kenya after the top court in the nation upheld Uhuru Kenyatta's victory in the presidential election. The deaths occurred Saturday in Kisumu, the stronghold of his chief rival, Raila Odinga. At least 22 others were hospitalized, the Kenya Red Cross said. Most of the casualties suffered gunshot wounds, said Abbas Gullet, chief of the local Red Cross . The rest of the country remained relatively calm after the ruling. Protesters took to the streets in Kisumu after the Supreme Court ruling Saturday that dismissed Odinga's petition and retained Kenyatta's victory. They looted shops and lit bonfires on the road to block traffic, according to the Red Cross. Kenyatta, 51, won the March 4 election with 50.07% of the vote. Odinga, who got 43.31%, had challenged the outcome in court on the grounds that it was flawed and marred by technical problems. After the court issued its ruling, he said he accepted its judgment and would abide by it. ""The court has now spoken,"" Odinga said, ""I wish the president-elect and his team well."" Kenyatta will be sworn in April 9, making him the nation's fourth and youngest president. Kenyatta and Odinga are the sons of the nation's first president and vice president, respectively, bringing back memories of a political dynasty that dates to the 1960s. Their fathers started out as allies in the quest for Kenyan independence from Britain. But the elder politicians' relationship ended in bad blood when founding President Jomo Kenyatta forced out his vice president, Jaramogi Odinga, following a series of disputes.","The rest of the country is relatively calm after the ruling .

"(CNN) -- The deaths of more than 70 football fans shortly after a match between Cairo's Al Ahly club and the Al Masry club in Port Said, Egypt, shocked the world. More than 1,000 more were injured in scenes that will leave an indelible mark on post-revolution Egypt -- because in Egypt soccer matters perhaps more than anywhere. Passions have always run high in Egyptian football. The Cairo derby between Al Ahly and their rivals Zamalek is the biggest football match in Africa, and has to be held at a neutral venue, usually with a neutral foreign referee, to combat a history of enmity and violence. Egypt in mourning as death toll rises . In 2009, a World Cup qualifier between Egypt and Algeria sparked riots in Cairo, Algiers and beyond. But domestic football has also been on the frontline during the revolution that toppled former president Hosni Mubarak last year. For the past five years, highly organized and anti-authoritarian fan groups of ""Ultras,"" especially from Al Ahly and Zamalek, have been in conflict with the police at football grounds, objecting to the heavy handed treatment meted out to them by Mubarak's forces. In a country that had little public space, there were two forums for dissent: the mosque and the football stadium. ""The whole concept of any independent organization didn't exist, not unions, not political parties,"" explained the leader of the Al Ahly ultras last April. See high-res images of the riots . ""Then we started to organize football ultras ... to them it was the youth, in big numbers -- very smart people -- who could mobilize themselves quickly. They feared us."" When the revolution began, the groups joined forces and led many of the protests in Cairo's Tahrir Square. Some even credit the ultras with a major role in several of the key battles. But that hasn't endeared them to the authorities post revolution. How football fans toppled Mubarak . Since February, violence has continued to blight the game. The Egyptian Football Association even considered canceling last season's league. Much of that was blamed on the security vacuum left when Mubarak's hated police force melted back in to the population. Although other people -- and many within Egypt's ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces [SCAF] -- view the ultras as the problem. CNN Arabic . In that context, the deaths of 79 fans -- most if not all hailing from Al Ahly -- at a football match will leave many within Egypt questioning how and why this has happened as the police watched on. SCAF has ordered the cancellation of the league as they deal with the worst civil disturbance to hit Egypt since the revolution. Al Ahly's fans announced three days of mourning and took to the streets to protest, demanding answers. Wednesday's tragedy will reverberate far beyond the pitch.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- A massive fire engulfed a newly constructed, unoccupied luxury hotel in central Beijing on Monday night as crowds watched a nearby fireworks display marking the end of Lunar New Year celebrations. The cause of the blaze at the 40-story Mandarin Oriental is unknown. The cause of the blaze at the 40-story Mandarin Oriental is not known and there were no reports of injuries, according to CNN staff members who were at the scene. The fire began about 9 p.m. and continued to burn an hour later. A plume of flames shot from the top of the structure as the fire quickly spread. iReporter Jean de Villeneuve lives about 200 yards (200 meters) from the fire and said she watched it for about an hour before firefighters got it under control. De Villeneuve, who is originally from France, said she was surprised at how close spectators were allowed to get before authorities established a perimeter. ""I looked and saw the huge tower full of fire, and there were hundreds of Chinese down near my apartment taking pictures,"" she said. ""If this had been the United States, you would think a perimeter would be secured, but there was nothing like that.""  Watch flames devour the hotel » . De Villeneuve said she and others were able to get within 60 yards of the fire. The state-run Xinhua news agency reported that more than 1,000 people in the area were evacuated, ""traffic controls were imposed"" on a major highway and authorities temporarily stopped subway service on a line serving the area. ""Snow-like ashes fell as far as [half a mile] from the building and smoke eclipsed the full moon,"" Xinhua reported of the blaze in the capital's central business district.  See photos of the blaze » . iReporter Fred Rice, a British national who lives in Beijing, said ""the top of the building was exploding."" ""We weren't sure if it was gas canisters or what. It was a spectacular sight for sure,"" he said. iReporter Stephen Chaytor said he was walking home from work when he saw the fire.  Watch the hotel burn » . ""It was spreading incredibly fast. It was obvious that there was a lot of debris on site -- that debris ignited very quickly,"" Chaytor said. ""Fire took control of building [and] within less than 13 minutes, it went from small flames to being totally engulfed in flames."" He said a crowd of onlookers gathered around the scene, as well as fire and emergency crews who worked to control the blaze. ""There was a quiet concern for people that may be involved, working in the building or close to construction site,"" he said. iReport.com: Are you there? The fire reached past the 30th floor, but did not spread to any adjacent buildings. The hotel is next to a newly constructed tower for China Central Television (CCTV), but no one has moved into that building either. The blaze erupted in the final hours of the Chinese Lunar New Year celebration as people set off fireworks across the city. Xinhua reported that Beijing residents were supposed to stop selling and lighting fireworks by midnight. iReporter de Villeneuve said she suspects many people in the city were trying to use whatever remaining fireworks they had before the deadline. ""We have been seeing fireworks for the past two weeks. I have to say this is quite a surprise,"" she said. iReport.com: Eyewitnesses worried 'building might topple' iReporter Rice said he was watching fireworks nearby when he noticed that fireworks were being set off near the buildings. ""Then we looked closer and saw the flames come from the top of the building,"" Rice said. ""Soon became apparent that the building was on fire."" The modern, angular building was a sign of Beijing's recent transformation and modernization. It had been scheduled to open late last year, but the opening was postponed until this year, though most of the building had been constructed. According to its Web site, the Mandarin Oriental-Beijing is the flagship property in China for the Mandarin Oriental hotel chain. The tower stands more than 500 feet high and contains 241 rooms, Xinhua reported.","iReporter who lives nearby says she saw ""huge tower full of fire""

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy has urged the world of golf to come together and unite over the controversial rule changes on putting. The World No.1 fears that the game could be torn apart with the PGA Tour joining the PGA of America in opposing the proposed ban of advanced anchored putters from 2016. Golf's governing bodies, the Royal & Ancient (R & A) and the United States Golf Association (USGA), announced the plan last year with the 90-day consultation period set to expire on Thursday. The R & A is the rule-making authority throughout the world of golf, excluding the U.S. and Mexico where the USGA runs the sport. ""Anchored"" putting method to be banned from 2016 . PGA Tour commissioner Tom Finchem has already stated that the organization did not see ""a competitive advantage to be gained by using anchoring."" But McIlroy, who has previously spoken in favor of the ban, says a decision needs to be taken across the whole of the sport from the PGA Tour to the European Tour. ""I saw what Tim Finchem had to say and it seems like the European Tour is going to go a different way,"" McIlroy told a press conference ahead of the Honda Open. ""I read a thing Monty (Colin Montgomerie) said that this divide isn't good for golf and I don't think it is. We either need to all be on one side or the other. ""It's up to the governing bodies at the end of the day to decide. I sort of think it was a bit of a knee jerk reaction to how much success people were having with it (players using long putters have won three of the last five majors). ""I'm all for people enjoying the game and trying to make the game as easy as possible and bringing people to the game, and if that means they should allow anchored putters to make it easier for the general public then that's a good thing. ""But then they talk about bifurcation, whether you should have one set of rules for us and one set for the amateurs and it's just a bit of a mess and opened a can of worms."" PGA Tour against 'belly putter' ban . The PGA Tour runs the American circuit and plays a leading role in staging World Golf Championship events. It has traditionally adopted the rules of the R&A and USGA, which runs the Open Championship and U.S. Open, while the PGA of America organizes the US PGA Championship and American Ryder Cup team. With the European Tour already having announced its intention to abide with the R&A agenda, McIlroy feels the rest of the world should fall in line. He added: ""We have put the game of golf in the hands of the R&A and USGA for I don't know how many years and have always abided by the rules that they've set and I don't think there should be any difference. ""If it were up to me, whatever decision the USGA comes to, maybe the pressure the PGA Tour has put on them, they might change their minds and rethink about it, and if they do that it's totally fine with me.""","World No.1 Rory McIlroy wants uniformity over putter ban proposal .

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho has completed his widely-expected return to Chelsea after the English Premier League club ended weeks of speculation by confirming Monday that the former Real Madrid coach has agreed a four-year contract. ""I am delighted to welcome Jose back to Chelsea. His continued success, drive and ambition made him the outstanding candidate,"" Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay said in a statement. ""It is our aim to keep the club moving forward to achieve greater success in the future, and Jose is our number one choice as we believe he is the right manager to do just that. ""He was and remains a hugely popular figure at the club and everyone here looks forward to working with him again."" In his first interview since taking charge, the Portuguese told Chelsea TV that he was offering fans the same qualities that he did when he first took charge of the club nine years ago -- namely, a pledge to deliver quality work, love and passion to bring success to the Blues. ""It is exactly the same message but now I can say I am one of you -- and that makes a little bit of a difference,"" he said. ""In football, I had in my career two great passions: Inter and Chelsea. Chelsea is more important for me. ""It was very, very hard to play against Chelsea - I did it only twice, which was not so bad -- so now I promise exactly the same things that I promised in 2004, with the difference that I am one of you."" After leaving Chelsea in 2007, it was not until 2010 that Mourinho returned to Stamford Bridge as a visiting coach, winning a Champions League quarterfinal 1-0 in March 2010 to seal a 3-1 aggregate win for an Inter Milan side who would go on to lift that year's trophy. Chelsea said the 50-year-old would bring his three coaching staff -- Rui Faria, Silvino Louro and Jose Morais -- who will work alongside the current first-team coaches Steve Holland, Christophe Lollichon and Chris Jones. Mourinho first joined Chelsea on June 2, 2004 and dubbed himself ""the Special One"" after having led Porto to the European title the previous season. He was unable to take Chelsea to the Champions League final, but guided the club to two successive EPL titles -- its first English championship successes since 1955. After falling out with Chelsea's Russian owner Roman Abramovich in 2007, Mourinho joined Inter Milan the following season and won two successive Italian Serie A titles and the Champions League in 2010. He was then courted by Real with the goal of ending the club's long wait for a record-extending 10th European title, but despite winning La Liga in his second season Madrid fell three times at the semifinal stage of the Champions League and his relationship with key Spanish players such as captain Iker Casillas deteriorated. As in Italy, he had a prickly time with the local press -- who took every opportunity to publish stories about dressing-room unrest at the Santiago Bernabeu. Real announced last month that he would be leaving, despite having signed a contract extension until 2016. Mourinho's final game in charge of was Saturday's 4-2 win over Osasuna, which left the Spanish club in second place in La Liga -- 15 points behind Barcelona. He did not talk to reporters after the match, though he did an interview with Spanish television in which he denied omitting goalkeeper Casillas and defender Pepe -- with whom he has had public disputes -- and top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo for any other reason than they were not fit enough to play. Last month he described this season as the worst in his career after losing the Spanish Cup final to Atletico Madrid, meaning no trophy for Real in 2012-13. ""I wish everyone associated with Real Madrid much happiness in the future,"" he said in a statement on Friday. ""I appreciate the support of lots of fans and respect the criticism of others. Once again, a lot of happiness to everyone and, above all, good health. Hala Madrid!"" His return to Chelsea was one of the worst-kept secrets in world football -- the English Premier League jumped the gun by announcing his reappointment Sunday before a deal has been done. The EPL's website published a story, dated Monday, with the headline ""Jose Mourinho makes Chelsea return."" Its subheader read: ""Portuguese coach back at Stamford Bridge after signing a XX-year contract."" The story was taken down, and the EPL issued a statement apologizing to Chelsea -- which was searching for a new manager following the departure of interim coach Rafael Benitez. ""It was a publishing error. We took it down as soon as we were notified of it, and we've spoken to and apologized to Chelsea,"" the EPL said. Benitez led Chelsea to third place in the EPL, guaranteeing a place in the Champions League next season after taking over from the sacked Roberto Di Matteo in November. The Spaniard also took Chelsea to success in the Europa League, with the club having dropped to the second-tier competition after becoming the first Champions League winner to fail at the group stage the following season.","Chelsea announces that Jose Mourinho will return to the English football club .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A national poll indicates that most Americans don't want to see an investigation of Bush administration officials who authorized harsh interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists, even though most people think such procedures were forms of torture. Half of the Americans polled approve of the Bush administration's efforts to interrogate terror suspects. Six in 10 people questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday believe that some of the procedures, such as waterboarding, were a form of torture, with 36 percent disagreeing. But half the public approves of the Bush administration's decision to use of those techniques during the questioning of suspected terrorists, with 50 percent in approval and 46 percent opposed. ""Roughly one in five Americans believe those techniques were torture but nonetheless approve of the decision to use those procedures against suspected terrorists,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""That goes a long way toward explaining why a majority don't want to see former Bush officials investigated."" Fifty-seven percent of those questioned don't want Congress to investigate Bush officials who authorized those harsh interrogation procedures, with 42 percent calling for action by lawmakers. Fifty-five percent also don't want a similar investigation by an independent panel. Investigations of the military and intelligence personnel who actually used those techniques during interrogations are even less popular. Nearly two out of three Americans don't want Congress to investigate the who carried out those procedures. Fifty-five percent don't want a similar investigation by an independent panel. The poll's release comes as a preliminary internal report on the Justice Department investigation into the authors of the Bush administration's ""torture memos"" does not call for criminal prosecutions but indicates that the government might urge state bar associations to take sanctions against the memo writers, according to two government sources. The draft, which now goes to Attorney General Eric Holder for approval or revisions, is expected to be finalized in the coming days. ""The Obama administration's recent decisions not to launch an investigation into these matters may sit well with the public overall but not with members of Obama's own party,"" Holland said. ""Most independents and Republicans don't think it's a good idea to investigate Bush officials involved in these decisions. But about two-thirds of Democrats support such investigations.""

""What's really funny is, they [Iraq war critics] never talk to real soldiers,"" the caller said. ""They like to pull these soldiers that come up out of the blue and talk to the media."" ""The phony soldiers,"" Limbaugh then said. Several Democrats released statements late last week condemning the remarks, and in a speech on the Senate floor Monday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called the comments ""so beyond the pale of decency that it cannot be left alone."" ""Just as patriotism is the exclusive realm of neither party, taking a stand against those who spew hate and impugn the integrity of our troops is a job that belongs to all of us,"" Reid said. ""I can't help but wonder how my Republican colleagues would have reacted if the tables were turned -- if a well-known Democratic radio personality had used the same insulting line of attack against troops who support the war,"" the Nevada Democrat added. Reid, along with several other Democrats, also plan to send a letter to Clear Channel Communications CEO Mark Mays this week, calling on him to formally condemn Limbaugh's comments. Clear Channel syndicates Limbaugh's show. Limbaugh blasted Reid on Monday, saying on his radio program, ""These people have had three, four days now to learn the truth about this, and they no doubt know the truth, which doesn't matter."" ""What they are trying to do is flood a false story into the Drive-By Media and have that survive and suffice as the evidence and as the story of what I said when it wasn't,"" he added. Responding to his critics on Friday's show, Limbaugh said he was ""taken out of context,"" adding his remark was referring to one soldier specifically -- Jesse MacBeth, a vocal war critic who falsely claimed to have served in Iraq. ""The effort here is simply to discredit people that they consider effective and powerful on the right ginning up, leading up into the '08 elections,"" Limbaugh said Friday. Speaking on his radio show Friday, Limbaugh called the Democratic attacks on him ""a smear"" and said ""this is is a great illustration of the liberals and the Democrat Party playbook for '08, which is underway now."" On Thursday, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, a veteran of the Vietnam War, called the comments a ""disgusting attack."" ""In a single moment on his show, Limbaugh managed to question the patriotism of men and women in uniform who have put their lives on the line and many who died for his right to sit safely in his air-conditioned studio peddling hate,"" Kerry said in a statement. The controversy over Limbaugh's statement comes after the liberal advocacy group MoveOn.org accused the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus, in full page ad in the New York Times last month of ""cooking the books for the White House"" in his testimony to Congress last week. Last week, the House voted 341-79 to condemn the liberal group's recent newspaper ad dubbing Petraeus ""General Betray Us?"" The Senate also approved a resolution condemning the ad on a vote of 72-25. MoveOn.org said it stands by its ad. ""With every passing day, more information comes to light casting more and more doubt on the validity of the facts and conclusions presented by Gen. Petraeus in his testimony before Congress,"" Eli Pariser, MoveOn.org's Executive Director, said in a statement released after the House vote Wednesday. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- For thirty-two years I have been actively involved in the ongoing efforts to help bring Nazi war criminals to justice -- and the most common question I am asked concerns the age of the perpetrators. Is it still worthwhile to prosecute elderly Holocaust perpetrators? Personally, I never doubted the validity of these efforts, but because the question is understandable and deserves a serious answer, I want to present the case for continued prosecution. Firstly, the passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of those who participated in the Holocaust. Had these criminals been prosecuted decades ago, when they were far younger, the importance of the effort to bring them to justice would not have been questioned. They are just as guilty today as the day they committed their crime -- and they do not deserve a prize for eluding justice for so long. Germany seeks to prosecute former Nazi camp guard living in U.S. Second, old age should not grant protection to murderers. Reaching the age of 85 or 90 does not turn a mass murderer into a Righteous Gentile. The only issue of concern is a person's mental and physical health. There is no reason to ignore someone's crimes simply because they were born in 1915 -- as was Laszlo Csatary, who at least until recently was still driving his car. Third, every victim of the Nazis deserves that an effort be made to find the person(s) who turned them -- innocent men, women and children -- into victims, simply because they were classified as ""enemies of the Third Reich."" Ignoring any of the perpetrators simply because of age would be a betrayal of their victims. The continuing pursuit of Nazi war criminals sends a powerful message about the importance of holding genocidists accountable. If we want to prevent future crimes of the scope of the Holocaust, it has to be crystal-clear that persons who commit such crimes will almost certainly be caught and punished. Unfortunately, that has not been the case for all those who committed Holocaust crimes -- a reality which made tragedies like Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur much more possible. Lastly, the trials of Nazi war criminals and collaborators are a very powerful tool in the ongoing fight against Holocaust denial and distortion. They are an important addition to the existing documentation of the mass murders and emphasize the necessity of identifying those responsible. In that respect, the significance of the Shoa, or the Holocaust, and the reason its lessons are so crucial for mankind is that it was not an earthquake, tsunami or volcano, but rather a manmade tragedy carried out by human beings against their fellow humans. There are two other elements that often surface in discussing the continued prosecution of Nazi war criminals. The first concerns the issue of ""superior orders"" and the second relates to the question of regret. The cartoonist who kickstarted career in German POW camp . Ever since the Nuremberg trials, international law -- created in the wake of World War II and the Holocaust -- has rejected the alibi of superior orders and emphasized individual criminal responsibility, that every individual is responsible for his or her deeds, and must bear the consequences, even if they were ordered to do so by a person with a higher rank. Thus, Ivan (John) Demjanjuk for example, was convicted of ""accessory to murder"" in a German court in May 2011, for his service as an armed SS guard in the Sobibor death camp, where he was part of the group which carried out the murders under the orders of their superiors. What of the mindset of the accused? Many people have suggested that since many years have passed since the crimes were committed, the perpetrators probably regret their misdeeds, a factor which would ostensibly weaken the rationale for prosecution. While there may have been a few such cases of this, I have never encountered a single regretful or remorseful one in decades of dealing with dozens of Nazi murderers of many different nationalities, religions, occupations and walks of life. If anything my experience has taught me just the opposite. Even 50 and 60 years after the events, and with so much information easily available on the Holocaust in their countries of origin and/or residence, they remain proud of the murder of so many innocent Jews and other enemies of the Third Reich. The views expressed in this piece are solely those of Dr. Efraim Zuroff.","Zuroff: Age doesn't diminish the crimes of Nazi war criminals .

"Madrid (CNN) -- In Spain's deep economic crisis, the lucky ones could hardly believe their good fortune on Saturday --- holding a $26 share of a winning lottery ticket pays out a return of $528,000. The country's annual Christmas lottery pays out this year $2.2 billion to thousands of winners, but those holding the winning number for the top prize -- 76058 -- for El Gordo, or ""the fat one,"" reaped the biggest rewards, according to Spain's state-run lottery. The first prize paid $950 million overall, or 43 percent of the total prizes, and most of ""El Gordo"" was won by some residents of the historic university town of Alcala de Henares, just east of Madrid, the lottery administration said. There, in a working class neighborhood with public housing and many immigrants, Spanish media reported that champagne bottles were popping at the lottery office that sold many of the winning tickets. Spaniards typically buy a share of a ticket, among friends or family, at the local bar or workplace, so the joy was spread around. Is praying for a lottery win frowned upon? Depends on who you ask . A man in Alcala de Henares bought 10 shares -- an amount known as a ""full ticket,"" and now worth $5.2 million -- and had given them away other family members. One recipient, the father of a young child, said he would try to buy a decent home and a car. Another winner was a cafe owner who said he'd still probably open for business on Monday, after going to collect his earnings at the bank, Spanish media reported. The second biggest prize mostly went to residents in the town of Aranda de Duero, north of Madrid. Numerous towns across the nation also got a piece of the action, and some portions of the top El Gordo prize were sold in 15 Spanish provinces. But Spain's recession and the unemployment rate that tops 25% clearly had an impact on the lottery intake this year. Spaniards spent 8% less on lottery tickets this year than last, with the average Spaniard laying out only $68 for lottery ticket shares, down from $73 last year, the lottery administration said. The biggest winner is the state, which keeps $976 million, or 30% of the entire lottery intake, which reached $3.2 billion this year. The remaining 70% was distributed for prizes. This was the last year that Christmas lottery winnings over $3,300 will be tax free. Next year, anyone winning $3,300 or more will see their good fortune taxed at 20 percent, making the cash-strapped Spanish government even a bigger winner.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- In the fourth day of deliberations in the trial of a Philadelphia abortion doctor, jurors asked Friday for a description of the babies the doctor is accused of killing. Prosecutors say Kermit Gosnell, 72, killed babies by using scissors to cut their spinal cords. Authorities allege that some of the infants were born alive and viable during the sixth, seventh and eighth months of pregnancy. In Pennsylvania, abortions past 24 weeks are illegal unless the health of the mother is at stake. In addition to asking for the description of the four babies, the jurors asked to be given the written definition of RICO charges, and a property receipt for the medications removed from the clinic and put into evidence. RICO charges extend from the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. After consulting with attorneys, Judge Jeffrey Minehart answered the jury in the deliberation room. Gosnell and his co-defendant, Eileen O'Neill, 56, were not in the courtroom. The nature of the questions indicate the jury has completed the charge sheet for O'Neill -- who is charged with practicing without a license, not performing illegal abortions -- and have moved on to Gosnell. If found guilty of first-degree murder, Gosnell, who is not a board-certified obstetrician or gynecologist, could be sentenced to death. Gosnell originally faced first-degree murder charges in the deaths of seven babies and a count of third-degree murder in the death of Karnamaya Mongar, 41. Mongar died of an anesthetic overdose during a second-trimester abortion. Minehart threw out three of the seven first-degree murder charges last week. On the first day of deliberations, the jury sent out questions regarding one of the name of a patient and the definition of ""theft by deception."" O'Neill, who is a medical school graduate, is charged with participating in the operation of a corrupt organization and theft by deception for operating without a license to practice medicine. Gosnell also is charged with conspiracy, abortion at 24 or more weeks of pregnancy, theft, corruption of minors, solicitation and other related offenses. He and O'Neill have pleaded not guilty. The babies Gosnell is accused of killing include one that a former employee testified whined after it was expelled from its mother; one that a former employee testified was a large baby boy that breathed before having its neck snipped and was placed into a plastic box the size of a shoebox; one whose neck was snipped after an employee played with the baby; and one that was delivered into a toilet and appeared to be swimming before being scooped up and having its neck snipped. Defense attorney Jack McMahon has maintained that none of the infants was killed; rather, he said, they were already deceased as a result of Gosnell previously administering the drug Digoxin, which can cause abortion. In his closing argument, he accused prosecutors of ""the most extraordinary hype and exaggeration in the history of the criminal justice system,"" even adding that they are ""elitist"" and ""racist."" Gosnell, who is African-American, has been accused by authorities of preying on low-income, minority women. McMahon argued that Gosnell offered access to health care for people who were poor and without health insurance. Minehart also has tossed out all five abuse-of-corpse charges relating to storing the feet of aborted fetuses in plastic containers. The judge dismissed one count of infanticide, the intentional killing of an infant. Gosnell also is accused of reusing unsanitary instruments; performing procedures in filthy rooms, including some in which litter boxes and animals allegedly were present at the time; and allowing unlicensed employees -- including a teenage high school student -- to perform operations and administer anesthesia. Nine others who worked in the west Philadelphia medical office, including Gosnell's wife and sister-in-law, also were charged. Eight have pleaded guilty.","The jury is in the fourth day of deliberations in the trial of Kermit Gosnell .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Fighters pushed Sunday to the outskirts of one of Moammar Gadhafi's last bastions of support, setting the stage for possible clashes ahead of this week's deadline for loyalists of the ousted leader to surrender. Libya's new leaders gave Gadhafi loyalists in Sirte, Bani Walid and a handful of towns until Saturday to surrender or face military force. ""We're giving them a chance to come forward and negotiate surrender,"" Col. Ahmed Bani, spokesman for the National Transitional Council's defense ministry, told reporters Sunday. But there were indications that fighters were planning to enter Bani Walid, where a powerful tribe is sympathetic to Gadhafi, before the deadline. One of Gadhafi's sons, Saadi Gadhafi, told CNN's Nic Robertson in a phone conversation that negotiations aimed at a cease-fire had been going well, but that an ""aggressive"" speech broadcast by his brother, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, a few days ago caused talks to break down. He said he saw no further point in negotiating and believes the NTC is ready to go into Bani Walid. NTC negotiator Abdallah Kinshel said the planned talks fell apart after local leaders refused to come to the designated meeting spot -- a mosque outside of town -- and demanded the NTC fighters come into the town unarmed. The anti-Gadhafi forces refused. ""As far as we are concerned, negotiations are over from our side,"" Kinshel said. ""Military commanders must determine what the next steps will be."" Asked his location, Saadi Gadhafi said he is ""a little bit outside"" of Bani Walid but had been moving around. ""It seems that his options are running out,"" Robertson said. Saadi Gadhafi said he had not seen his father or brother for two months. He said he is ""neutral"" and not on his father's side or that of the rebels, but remains ""ready to help negotiate a cease-fire."" NTC fighters positioned outside Bani Walid said they remain unwilling to shed blood or fire shots. ""Some tribal leaders and many of the residents have surrendered their weapons, but there are still many loyalists who are protecting Moammar Gadhafi and his sons,"" National Transitional Council media coordinator Adel Zintani said. The deadline was extended by a week to curb further bloodshed and prevent further destruction, military commanders have said. ""This extension does not mean we are unaware of what Gadhafi's accomplices are up to,"" NTC chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil said at a news conference, countering earlier criticism that a grace period might give Gadhafi's forces to regroup. But Gadhafi's spokesman, who has not been seen since Tripoli fell, said key tribal leaders in Bani Walid remain loyal to the ousted leader. Musa Ibrahim, in a telephone call from an undisclosed location, told Reuters that the transitional council's messages ""are not being heeded here in Bani Walid."" Ibrahim also told Reuters that Gadhafi remained in Libya, though he said he did not know where. He did say Gadhafi was well defended. Anti-Gadhafi forces were positioned around the former leader's hometown of Sirte as well as Bani Walid, Jalil said Saturday. Asked to comment Sunday on a report that the NTC knows Gadhafi's whereabouts, Col. Bani refused to do so. Ali Tarhouni, interim deputy prime minister and oil minister of the NTC, said Bani Walid was close to falling. ""It's possible, although we are not sure, that the Bani Walid (tribe) has joined the revolution, and now it's under control of the revolutionaries,"" he said. Anti-Gadhafi fighters from the east pushed toward Bani Walid Saturday with virtually no resistance. They were able to reach El Mardum, which sits on the border of Bani Walid province and is home to Khamis Gadhafi's 32nd Brigade base. The anti-Gadhafi forces entered the base and arrested three men in civilian clothes they claim were loyalists. They also took seven armored personnel carriers. Tarhouni said Libya's new leadership will move their headquarters from Benghazi to Tripoli this week to begin implementing political plans to shape a new future. But for the time being, guns trump government on the streets of the capital. Tripoli has become a city of checkpoints, weapons and no real authority as the threat of Gadhafi's loyalists lingers. Jittery and suspicious anti-Gadhafi fighters blocked a road Saturday where a drive-by shooting occurred earlier. They collected weapons and registered them at police stations. Those who called themselves rebels just a week ago were now working with Tripoli's law enforcement authorities. With Gadhafi's armories emptied, guns -- always in large supply in Libya -- have proliferated on the streets. Those who want to carry weapons now must be issued identification cards, but the selection process is not centralized -- neighborhood councils are making that decision. A group called the Tripoli Revolutionary Council is trying to exert control over the city, creating the potential for further conflict with the established National Transitional Council in a volatile situation. Tarhouni announced Saturday the formation of the Supreme Security Committee, which held its first meeting Friday. Among the priorities for the committee were the protection of public institutions and weapons in Tripoli. The transitional council, meanwhile, is trying to get Libya's oil-dependent economy going again. It expects to restart oil production at the Misla and Sarir oil fields in less than two weeks, Tarhouni said. In related news, Cuba withdrew its ambassador from Libya, saying it does not recognize the NTC. CNN's Arwa Damon, Ben Wedeman, Mohammed Tawfeeq and Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.","NEW: Gadhafi's son says he is willing to negotiate a cease-fire .

"(CNN) -- A hepatitis A outbreak linked to a frozen fruit mix commonly used in smoothies has grown over the past week, from 34 to 87 reported cases, health officials said. The cases have been reported in eight states, up from five: Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Washington, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday. Thirty-six people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported, the CDC said. Townsend Farms recalled bags of its Organic Antioxidant Blend this month. The suspected fruit mix was sent to Costco and Harris Teeter stores, the CDC says. Health authorities have evaluated 68 of the 87 reported cases. Forty-six people reported eating the fruit mix, all of whom bought it from Costco, according to the CDC. Forty-five of the 68 cases are women; ages range from 2 to 84 years, authorities said. The outbreak has been traced to pomegranate seeds from Turkey that are in the fruit mix, according to Townsend Farms. The mix contains pomegranate seeds and other produce from Argentina, Chile and the United States. Frozen fruit mix suspected in hepatitis A outbreak . Hepatitis A is usually transmitted via contaminated food or water, or by someone who's infected, according to the Mayo Clinic. Frequent handwashing is recommended to limit the spread. The highly contagious infection inflames the liver, limiting its ability to function. While mild cases don't require treatment and the Mayo Clinic says most of those infected recover completely with no permanent liver damage, severe cases can lead to liver failure and death, according to the World Health Organization. There are an estimated 1.4 million cases of hepatitis A worldwide. At Costco, the recalled codes include T012415 through T053115; consumers can find these on the back of the package near the words ""Best by.""

"(CNN) -- Five foreign troops were killed Saturday in Afghanistan, bringing the number of NATO and U.S.-led coalition troop deaths in June to 32 -- more than in Iraq. A French NATO soldier stands guard in the Arghandab district of Afghanistan's Kandahar province on Friday. Foreign troop deaths in the Afghan war have been exceeding those in the Iraq conflict in recent weeks, according to figures compiled by CNN. The trend reflects a surge in attacks and clashes during the warmer months in Afghanistan, where U.S.- and NATO-led troops have been fighting tenacious Taliban militants. It also points to a decrease in violence in Iraq. Four service members assigned to the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan were killed Saturday by a roadside bomb and small-arms fire on a Task Force Phoenix convoy, said Lt. Col. Paul Fanning, spokesman for the U.S. military. The convoy was on a mission to train Afghan national police and soldiers when it was attacked, Fanning said. About three dozen nations have committed troops to that training effort, which includes more than 700 training teams and 8,000 trainers across Afghanistan. Two other troops were seriously wounded in the attack.  Watch journalists break out their flak jackets » . Also early Saturday, a Polish soldier assigned to NATO's International Security Assistance Force was killed and four others were wounded by a roadside bomb while on patrol in the Dila district of Afghanistan's Paktika province, the assistance force said. Later Saturday, a NATO-led base and an Afghan military compound were attacked from across the border in Pakistan, the assistance force said. There were no reported casualties in the incident at 5:15 p.m. The Pakistan military was notified. At least 32 troops assigned to the U.S.-led coalition and NATO's International Security Assistance Force have died in Afghanistan in June. At least 12 Americans, nine Britons, two Canadians, one Pole, a Romanian and a Hungarian have died in Afghanistan in June. The nationalities of six other fatalities have not been released. In comparison, 19 coalition troops have died in June so far in Iraq, comprising 18 Americans and one from the Republic of Georgia. There are no NATO troops in Iraq. Aggressive military campaigns against Sunni and Shiite militants have helped reduce casualties in Iraq, as have efforts to bring Sunni militants into U.S.-backed militias and the cease-fire of the mainstream part of Muqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi army. During May, 23 coalition troops died in Afghanistan and 21 died in Iraq. The deaths last month in Afghanistan included 17 Americans, three Britons, a Canadian, a Lithuanian and an Estonian. In Iraq, there were 19 American and two Georgian deaths last month. The 19 American deaths in May represent the lowest monthly American total of the war. Overall, the Iraq conflict has been the deadlier war for foreign troops. More than 4,400 foreign troops have died in the Iraq war; more than 800 have died in Afghanistan. In both wars, the vast majority of fatalities are Americans. ""It's a difficult time right now, but it's an extremely dangerous job,"" Fanning said after Saturday's attacks in southern Afghanistan's Kandahar province. ""This is a combat theater. This is why we're here. The enemy's doing their best to thwart the progress we've made, but we're determined not to let them succeed."" Much of the fighting has occurred across southern Afghanistan, where Taliban attacks tend to increase as the weather warms up. Afghan and NATO forces last week pushed Taliban militants out of several villages in the Arghandab district of Kandahar province after a huge prison break on June 13, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said. The Afghan Ministry of Defense said 56 Taliban fighters had been killed in the operation. Officials said they had no firm figures on the number wounded. There is fighting in other parts of the country as well. The U.S.-led coalition said its forces on Saturday conducted precision airstrikes in Khost province targeting a Taliban commander involved with roadside bombings, foreign fighter operations and weapons smuggling. Khost is in the eastern part of the country. In the northeastern province of Kapisa, a coalition operation led to the deaths of several militants and the detention of three others on Friday, the coalition said Saturday. NATO's International Security Assistance Force on Saturday also reported the deaths of several militants in fighting Thursday in Helmand and Kandahar provinces in the south.","NEW: NATO, Afghan force attacked from across Pakistan border; no casualties .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Three witnesses whose testimony could absolve a 14-year-old Pakistani girl facing life in prison have changed their statements. It's the latest twist in the case of Rimsha Masih, a Christian teenager who was charged more than a month ago under Pakistan's blasphemy laws for allegedly burning pages of Islam's holy book for cooking fuel. She has denied the charges. The three witnesses initially told police they saw Khalid Jadoon Chishti, a Muslim cleric, tear pages out of a copy of the Quran and put them with police evidence that led to the charges against Rimsha. But they recanted those statements on Monday at a bail hearing for the cleric, according to the imam's lawyer, Wajid Ali Gilani. A fourth witness stood by his initial statement. The witnesses are a critical part of the police investigation that determined last week that the imam framed the teen. Based on that investigation and a lack of witnesses, her lawyers are now appealing to have the blasphemy charges dismissed. The teen's case has sparked international outcry against the Pakistani government, with some saying the blasphemy laws are used to settle scores and persecute religious minorities. Islamabad's police chief accused the three witnesses of lying to the court on Monday, and said investigators never pressured the witnesses when they gave their initial statements against the cleric. ""If they have changed their statements, they are just lying,"" Chief Bin Yamin said. Police arrested Rimsha in August after her neighbor accused her of burning Quran pages to for cooking fuel, investigators said. The neighbor began to shout in protest, drawing a crowd that grew angry. Some neighbors said the teenager was beaten. Others said she ran back home and locked herself inside. When police arrived, they arrested her. Rimsha's lawyers said the neighbor wanted to settle a personal score with the girl because the two didn't get along. They said it's likely that he liked the teen and she didn't feel the same. The lawyers say that no one actually saw Rimsha burning the papers, but that the neighbor went to Chishti with the bags. According to police, Chishti wasn't certain that simply burning pages with texts from the Quran would be enough to convict Rimsha on blasphemy charges. So, he added two pages from the actual holy book to the bag to bolster the case, they said. In addition to charges of tampering with evidence, Chishti could also face blasphemy charges as a result of the police investigation. The pursuit of the accusations against the cleric is significant in Pakistan because ""never before has a false accuser been held accountable,"" according to Ali Dayan Hasan, the Pakistan director of Human Rights Watch Hasan. After her arrest in August, Rimsha had been held in an adult jail before she was released on bail in September. A local court transferred her case to the juvenile court last week after the police investigation said she had been framed. Islamabad High Court will consider the petition to drop the charges against Rimsha on October 17, said Abdul Hamid Rana, the teen's leading lawyer. If the charges are not dismissed, her case will proceed in juvenile court. Having her case transferred to juvenile court ""is a precursor to the case ending,"" said Hasan of Human Rights Watch. ""That is quite unprecedented in the 25-year history of Pakistan's blasphemy laws,"" he said last week. It's unclear how the change in statements from the key witnesses will affect her case. Blasphemy laws were first instituted to keep peace between religions. Actions perceived as insults to Islam provoke fierce reactions in the predominantly Muslim nation, as demonstrated by the recent angry protests in response to an anti-Islam film produced in the United States and made available online. There have been 1,400 blasphemy cases since the laws were first enacted in 1986, according to Human Rights Watch. There are more than 15 cases of people on death row for blasphemy in Pakistan, and 52 people have been killed while facing trial for the charge, he said. Rimsha and her family spoke to CNN last month from an undisclosed location after she was released on bail. The teen denied that she defiled the Quran. She said she was happy to be with her family, but feared for her life. ""I'm scared,"" she said by phone. ""I'm afraid of anyone who might kill us."" No matter how her case pans out, it's unclear what kind of life she might be able to have. Aid groups in the United States, Italy and Canada have offered the teen and her family a home outside Pakistan, a family representative said. But she has said she wants to stay in her home country.","Witnesses initially said an imam framed a teen girl accused of burning Quran pages .

"(CNN) -- What was in that meteor that exploded spectacularly over Russia's Urals region last week? Radioactive spores? Tiny Martians? Kryptonite? Nope, just rock and a bit of iron, according to Russian scientists who tracked fragments of the meteor to the frozen surface of Lake Chebarkul. Scientists from Urals Federal University found 53 small meteorites on the surface of the lake and believe a larger fragment is under water, said Viktor Grokhovsky, the scientist who led the effort. The fragments point to a rocky meteor with about 10% iron mixed in, Grokhovsky told CNN. 11 meteor tweets we wish we'd thought of . The meteor exploded Friday in the air near Chelyabinsk, leaving behind nothing but meteorites, thousands of broken windows and some pretty spectacular video of it streaking across the sky before exploding in a noisy, luminous fireball. The explosion startled residents going about their morning business and damaged more than 4,700 buildings, mostly apartments. About 3,500 had been repaired as of Monday, the state-run RIA Novosti news service reported. About 1,000 people suffered injuries, mostly from flying glass. One woman was flown to Moscow for treatment of a spinal injury, state media reported. Russia starts cleanup after meteor strike . State officials said 19 people remained hospitalized Monday, RIA Novosti reported. Local officials have estimated the damage at more than 1 billion rubles ($33.2 million), RIA Novosti said. The state applied for 500 million rubles in aid from the federal government to help make repairs, the news service reported. Chelyabinsk Gov. Mikhail Yurevich promised compensation to all those affected, the official Itar-Tass news agency said. Police are also monitoring online auction sites and social media after reports of people trying to sell what they claim to be meteorites from Friday's explosion, RIA Novosti said. Some of the sellers are asking as much as $4,000 each, state-run RT television reported. The U.S. space agency, NASA, said the meteor released nearly 500 kilotons of energy, about 33 times more than the nuclear bomb the United States dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945.

NASA estimated the meteor's diameter at 55 feet (17 meters) and said it was the largest reported since 1908, when a meteor exploded over Tunguska in remote Siberia, destroying 80 million trees over an area of 820 square miles. ""We would expect an event of this magnitude to occur once every 100 years on average,"" Paul Chodas of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory said last week. ""When you have a fireball of this size, we would expect a large number of meteorites to reach the surface, and in this case there were probably some large ones.""

"(Mashable) -- At least one former Apple exec wasn't surprised or sad to hear the news that iOS chief Scott Forstall is leaving the company. Tony Fadell, Apple's former top hardware designer and the man considered to be the brains behind the iPod, told the BBC in a recent interview that Forstall ""got what he deserved."" Fadell continued, ""I think what happened just a few weeks back was deserved and justified and it happened."" Forstall was an influential figure at Apple for years who oversaw the development of the company's mobile operating system and was at one point seen as a possible successor to Steve Jobs. His departure was announced last month as part of a larger executive shakeup at the company. Several reports since then have suggested that Forstall didn't get along well with some other key players on the team and angered CEO Tim Cook by refusing to apologize for Apple's maps application. In the interview, Fadell hints that Forstall wasn't exactly a beloved figure at the company probably won't be missed much. ""If you read some of the reports, people were cheering in Cupertino when that event happened,"" he said. Fadell, who left Apple in 2008 and went on to create the Nest thermostat, went on to argue that Apple and its employees may actually be in a better position now that Forstall is gone. ""I think Apple is in a great space, it has great products and there are amazing people at the company, and those people actually have a chance to have a firm footing now and continue the legacy Steve left,"" he said.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- An Australian teenager reported missing two months ago has been found alive in dense bushland not far from his home, local police say. Matthew Allen, 18, was last seen at his family home near Westleigh, a suburb about 30 kilometers (20 miles) away from Sydney, on November 27. Police feared the worst as the teen had not taken his mobile phone with him or accessed his bank accounts. More from CNN Justice: Three years later, no sign of missing family . Extensive searches by police and emergency services failed to find him. On Saturday, two hikers told police that they had spotted a ""disorientated man"" in bushland not far from Westleigh. When rescuers reached Allen, he was in a bad way suffering from exhaustion and dehydration. Local media said he was emaciated, covered in leeches and mosquito bites and his feet and lower legs were suffering from gangrene. It was believed he had been in the bush the entire nine weeks he was missing, police said. More from CNN Justice: Casey Anthony files for bankruptcy . ''He was in such a poor state,'' Detective Acting Inspector Glyn Baker told the Sydney Morning Herald. ''He was completely exhausted, completely dehydrated, suffered significant weight loss, somewhere up to 50%. He was suffering from partial blindness and he had leeches all over him.'' He was winched out by a rescue helicopter and taken to a nearby hospital, where he was reunited with his family. Allen went missing during a record heatwave when Sydney endured temperatures above 45 degrees Celsius. According to ABC, Allen told his rescuers that he had survived on water from a creek bed that was almost dry. Detectives have been unable to speak to him and believe there may be more to his story, ABC reported.

"Boston (CNN) -- One of three friends accused of helping Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev cover up his alleged crime got out on bond Monday, released to his mother's custody. Robel Phillipos left the federal courthouse in a red Toyota sedan after a judge set bail at $100,000. He will stay at his mother's home, where he was living before his arrest last week, and be monitored electronically, according to terms his lawyers and prosecutors agreed to before Monday's hearing. ""I'm certainly happy for his mother and his family,"" family friend Michelle Borden told reporters outside the courthouse. ""Now he has the comfort and the guidance he needs."" The courtroom was filled with friends and relatives during the Monday's hearing, during which Phillipos appeared in jail coveralls and handcuffs. ""Now we look forward to defending him in the coming months,"" defense lawyer Derege Demissie said. ""We are confident in the end he will be able to clear his name."" The FBI says that on April 18, the three friends -- Phillipos, Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev -- went to Tsarnaev's dorm room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. According to court documents, Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev removed items from the room, including a laptop and a backpack loaded with fireworks, while Phillipos made false statements to bombing investigators. Phillipos is a U.S. citizen and a Boston native. Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov are from Kazakhstan and had visas to study in the United States. ""At no time did Robel have any prior knowledge of this marathon bombing, nor did he participate in the planning done by the defendant in this case,"" Phillipos co-counsel Susan Church said. ""He is not charged with, nor is he alleged to have disposed with, the backpack, or had any role in what the two other students who are here on visas did with the backpack."" Five major developments in Boston case . Here are the latest developments in the cases: . Robel Phillipos . Phillipos was a ""frightened and confused 19-year-old"" when authorities questioned him several times in the days that followed the April 15 bombing, which killed three people and wounded more than 260. Police believe Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, set off the two bombs near the race's finish line. Phillipos was under tremendous pressure when he was interrogated and didn't have an attorney at the time to help him, according to his attorneys. In asking for bail, attorneys said their client's future has been ruined by the arrest. ""He will suffer its enduring and devastating effect for the rest of his life. The only way he can salvage his future is by clearing his name,"" the documents say. Phillipos faces up to eight years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted. The judge Monday warned Phillipos not to tamper with witnesses on the threat of being locked up again. He attended high school with the younger Tsarnaev at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where they both live. According to the court document, Phillipos hadn't seen or talked to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for at least two months before the bombing. He was taking a semester off from UMass-Dartmouth and was only on campus the night of April 18 for a seminar. The document says Phillipos' presence on campus that night is a case of ""sheer coincidence and bad luck."" Phillipos was living with his mother, an Ethiopian who immigrated to the United States in the 1980s and is now employed as a social worker. ""Everyone knows Robel as being a compassionate, thoughtful and sociable person,"" his mother, Genet Bekele, said in an affidavit. Previously, a friend described Phillipos as a good kid who took care of his mom. James Turney told CNN affiliate WBZ: ""Phillipos plays basketball and doesn't have any anti-American thing about him."" Azamat Tazhayakov . Tazhayakov's father, Amir Ismagulov, told CNN he met with his son for about 40 minutes last week. Both father and son believe in the U.S. justice system, Ismagulov said. Father defends son arrested in connection with bombing case . The government will get to the bottom of what happened and let Tazhayakov go, said the father, speaking in Russian. He was in the ""wrong place, (at the) wrong time, with (the) wrong people,"" his father said. Tazhayakov is due back in court May 14. He was already in federal custody on immigration charges related to his student visa, having been arrested in the days after the bombings due to his friendship with Tsarnaev. The Kazakhstan native is charged with obstruction of justice. If found guilty, he could face up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. He is being represented by Arkady Bukh, an attorney based in New York. Ismagulov said his son always admired and wanted to come to the United States. He was here to study engineering and work in the oil business, his father said. Teenagers sometimes do stupid things, said Ismagulov, stressing that his son didn't know he was doing anything wrong. Ismagulov said that he asked his son whether he had wanted to help Tsarnaev. He apparently told his father no, saying that if they had wanted to help Tsarnaev, he and Kadyrbayev would have thrown out the bombing suspect's laptop and buried his backpack in the ground. Investigators found the backpack, loaded with fireworks, in a landfill after a two-day search. Tsarnaev's laptop was turned over by Kadyrbayev on April 19, the same day the FBI raided the apartment he shared with Tazhayakov, Kadyrbayev's attorney Robert Stahl said. According to the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, Tazhayakov is enrolled but has been suspended pending the outcome of the case. Dias Kadyrbayev . Kadyrbayev also remains in jail, awaiting a May 14 court date. According to an FBI affidavit, Kadyrbayev had seen pictures of the suspects released by the FBI on April 18 and texted Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to tell him ""he looked like the suspect on television."" Tsarnaev texted back ""lol"" and added, ""come to my room and take whatever you want.""' Attorney Stahl also said his client ""did not have anything to do"" with the bombings and disputed that he tried to block the investigation. Kadyrbayev, a Kazakh national, was taken into custody along with Tazhayakov on April 20 on suspicion that he had violated the terms of his student visa, Stahl said. According to an interview his father gave in April, Kadyrbayev, 19, ""missed a couple, or maybe several classes."" ""I can say about my son that he finished school with excellent grades; he was good at math. He helped others. When he saw that help was needed, he always accommodated,"" Murat Kadyrbayev told Tengi News and STV channel in Kazakhstan. Kadyrbayev is not currently enrolled at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. He is charged with obstruction of justice and could face up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines if found guilty. Kazakhstan's foreign ministry said it was offering consular services to both Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov. ""We would like to emphasize that our citizens did not receive charges of involvement in the organization of the Boston Marathon bombings. They were charged with destroying evidence,"" the ministry said in a statement. CNN's Susan Candiotti reported from Boston; Steve Almasy reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Syria. Iran. Afghanistan. The list of foreign policy challenges facing the next president of the United States is long and daunting. CNN is posing a series of questions about how potential voters would like to see the president approach these issues, as part of a partnership with Facebook aimed at increasing voter engagement ahead of of the 2012 presidential election. Here's how it works: CNN issues a question via a Facebook app, which requires users first to declare their intention to vote and then invites them to answer a series of multiple choice questions about issues in the election. As people answer, they can share answers with their friends and also see how their responses compare with others on Facebook. Click through the gallery for a look at the responses to the first set of foreign policy questions, broken down by demographic groupings gleaned from the respondents' Facebook profiles. It's important to note -- perhaps in part because the questions were asked of an online audience, and unlike a scientific poll were open to anyone who chooses to respond -- that a relatively large percentage of respondents in the Facebook surveys identified themselves as Democrats. The breakdown in the app (as of September 17) is 54% Democrat, 21% Republican and 25% Independent. For context, in a 2008 national exit poll the breakdown looked like this: 39% Democrat, 32% Republican and 29% Independent. In 2010 it was 35% Democrat, 35% Republican and 29% Independent.

"(CNN) -- Human decisions have complex roots: history, circumstance, personality, even chance. So it's a dangerous game to oversimplify reality, isolate causation and attribute any particular course of action to one or another singular motive. But let me tempt fate, since some recent government decisions suggest important issues for public discussion. Over the past several weeks, press accounts have outlined a series of Obama administration moves dealing with the cyberdefense of the United States. According to one report, the Department of Defense will add some 4,000 personnel to U.S. Cyber Command, on top of a current base of fewer than a thousand. The command will also pick up a ""national defense"" mission to protect critical infrastructure by disabling would-be aggressors. A second report reveals another administration decision, very reminiscent of the Bush Doctrine of preemption, to strike first when there is imminent danger of serious cyberattack against the United States. Both of these represent dramatic and largely welcome moves. But they also suggest the failure of a deeper national policy process and, more importantly, the failure to develop national consensus on some very difficult issues. Chinese military leading cyber attacks . Let me reason by analogy, and in this case the analogy is the program of targeted killings supported and indeed expanded by the Obama administration. Again, I have no legal or moral objections to killing those who threaten us. We are, as the administration rightly holds, in a global state of war with al Qaeda and its affiliates. But at the level of policy, killing terrorists rather than capturing them seems to be the default option, and part of that dynamic is fairly attributable to our inability to decide where to put a detainee once we have decided to detain him. Congress won't let him into the United States unless he is going before a criminal court, and the administration will not send him to Guantanamo despite the legitimate claim that a nation at war has the right to detain enemy combatants without trial. Failing to come to agreement on the implications of the ""we are at war"" position, we have made it so legally difficult and so politically dangerous to detain anyone that we seem to default to killing those who would do us harm. Clearly, it's an easier path: no debates over the location or conditions of confinement. Frequently such action can be kept covert. Decision-making is confined to one branch of government. Congress is ""notified."" Courts are not involved. Besides, we are powerful. We have technology at our fingertips. We know that we can be precise, and the professionalism of our combatants allows them to easily meet the standards of proportionality and distinction (between combatants and noncombatants) in such strikes, despite claims to the contrary. And we also believe that we can live with the second and third order effects of targeted killings. We believe that the care we show will set high standards for the use of such weapons by others who will inevitably follow us. We also believe that any long-term blowback (akin to what Gen. Stanley McChrystal calls the image of ""arrogance"" such strikes create) is more than offset by the immediate effects on America's safety. I agree with much of the above. But I also fear that the lack of political consensus at home can drive us to routinely exercise an option whose long-term effects are hard to discern. Which brings us back to last week's stories on American cyberdefense. In the last Congress, there were two prominent bills introduced to strengthen America's cyberdefenses. Neither came close to passing. In the Senate, the Collins-Lieberman Bill created a near perfect storm with the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Chamber of Commerce weighing in strongly against the legislation. That two such disparate bodies had issues with the legislation should suggest how far we are from a national consensus. In the House, a modest proposal from the Intelligence Committee to enhance cybersharing between the private sector and the National Security Agency was met with a presidential veto threat over alleged privacy concerns and was never even considered by the Senate. Indeed, my preferred option -- a more active and well-regulated role for NSA and Cyber Command on and for American networks -- is almost a third rail in the debate over U.S. cybersecurity. The cybertalent and firepower at Fort Meade, where both are headquartered, are on a short leash because few dare to even address what we would ask them to do or what we would permit them to do on domestic networks. And hence, last week's ""decisions."" Rather than settle the roles of these institutions by dealing with the tough issues of security and privacy domestically, we have opted for a policy not unlike targeted killing. Rather than opt for the painful process of building consensus at home, we are opting for ""killing"" threats abroad in their ""safe haven."" We appear more willing to preempt perceived threats ""over there"" than spill the domestic political blood that would be needed to settle questions about standards for the defense of critical infrastructure, the role of government surveillance or even questions of information sharing. And we seem willing to live with the consequences, not unlike those of targeted killings, of the precedent we set with a policy to shoot on warning. I understand the advantage that accrues to the offense in dealing with terrorists or cyberthreats. I also accept the underlying legality and morality of preemptive drone or cyberstrikes. I just hope that we don't do either merely because we don't have the courage to face ourselves and make some hard decisions at home.

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan will step down this month, concluding a long career that was clouded last year by a scandal at the agency involving agents and prostitutes ahead of a presidential summit in Colombia. Spokesman Brian Leary said on Friday that Sullivan would retire on February 22 after leading the agency that protects presidents and fights financial crime since 2006. He's been an agent for 30 years. There was no statement on the reason for his decision to leave. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano praised Sullivan career.

""Mark Sullivan epitomizes the term 'public service,' and has devoted his life to the safety of our first families, our nation's leaders, and the public at large,"" she said in a statement. But last April's episode in Colombia rocked the vaunted 150-year-old agency, prompting congressional inquiries and raising questions about its culture that currently is under review by a government watchdog. In that case, some agents working an advance detail for a trip by President Barack Obama brought prostitutes to their Cartagena hotel. The scandal also involved members of the military. Obama's security was not compromised and that the agency took subsequent steps intended to prevent similar problems on future trips, according to the Homeland Security Department inspector general. Nine agents eventually left or lost their jobs. Sullivan told Congress in May that such behavior was not routine when agents traveled on official business. He called the scandal an aberration.

Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, also credited Sullivan's response to the scandal.

"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (CNN) -- Republican presidential candidate John McCain criticized two of his future running mate's hometown projects in broadsides in 2001 against congressional ""pork-barrel"" spending, records from the Arizona senator's office show. Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin campaigns in Lee's Summit, Missouri, with Sen. John McCain Monday. McCain and running mate Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin have criticized such spending as a central part of their campaign for the White House. McCain has made pork-busting a centerpiece of his maverick pitch for years. But when Palin served as mayor of her hometown of Wasilla, outside Anchorage, she obtained about $27 million in federal ""earmarks"" during her last four years in office, according to the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense. In a 2001 statement opposing a transportation spending bill McCain singled out for criticism about $3 million worth of those projects. McCain's list of ""objectionable"" spending included a $2.5 million road project for the town that then had a population of 5,500, as well as a $450,000 appropriation for an agricultural processing plant there. McCain's campaign responded Wednesday by saying the record on pork-barrel spending ""is one we are eager to discuss.""  Watch McCain rail against earmarks » . ""As mayor of Wasilla, Gov. Palin was forced to work within the current system to obtain critical funding for a growing city,"" the campaign said in a statement. By comparison, it said, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama ""has consciously attempted to manipulate the system by requesting nearly $1 million every working day he has been in the Senate."" Palin already has been facing questions about her stump-speech claim to have said "" 'Thanks, but no thanks' for that bridge to nowhere up in Alaska."" Palin originally supported construction of the infamous bridge from Ketchikan to its airport on sparsely populated Gravina Island, but canceled work on the span in 2007 after the price tag increased from about $200 million to nearly $400 million and it became a symbol of congressional excess. The governor hasn't faced reporters since August 29, when McCain tapped her as his running mate. But her lieutenant governor, Sean Parnell, said Palin has reversed her support for earmarked spending projects because ""I think she saw what they were."" ""As you're in office longer, you see the cumulative effect from Wasilla to Pensacola, and you see the corruption that can come from those,"" Parnell said, referring to earmarks. Parnell is now locked in a still-unresolved GOP primary with ""Bridge to Nowhere"" advocate Don Young, the state's sole congressman for more than 30 years. Palin backed his challenge to Young in the Republican contest. But longtime Alaska journalist and former Palin staffer Larry Persily said the governor ""is telling only half the story, as far as the earmarks."" ""She was hungry for funding from the federal government that could help her community,"" Persily said. Palin not only sought money from Alaska's congressional delegation, but she hired the former chief of staff to veteran Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens -- now under indictment in a wide-ranging corruption probe -- for help. The result was that Wasilla won $600,000 for a new bus facility, $1.75 million to upgrade its dispatch center and $2.4 million to improve water and sewer facilities. ""We did well,"" Palin scrawled in the margins of a City Council memo on federal funds from 1999. Since becoming governor, she has cut the amount of money her vast, oil-rich state asks for from the federal government. But for the 2008 budget year, Alaska had more earmark requests per capita than any other state -- $500 for every resident. Palin sought about $450 million in earmarks during her first two years in state office, according to federal records. They include nearly $8 million to improve a remote airport in the Aleutian Islands, a former Navy airfield that handles eight scheduled flights a month; $4 million to research sea crab stocks; and $2 million to research rockfish.","McCain criticized about $3 million in Wasilla earmarks in 2001 statement .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- President Park Geun-hye of South Korea has dismissed her press spokesman after concluding that he was involved in an ""unsavory incident"" during a state visit to the United States, her office said. Police in Washington said they were investigating a report of sexual abuse. The spokesman, Yoon Chang-jung, ""showed inappropriate conduct as a high-ranking official and damaged the dignity of the country by being personally involved in an unsavory incident,"" the chief presidential press secretary, Lee Nam-ki, said in a statement Thursday from Los Angeles. The embarrassing affair adds an awkward coda to the five-day visit to the United States by Park, South Korea's first female president. During the high-profile trip, her first since taking office in February, she met with President Barack Obama to discuss the recent tensions with North Korea along with other strategic and economic issues. The South Korean Embassy in Washington now is investigating the incident, Lee said without providing further details on what Yoon is alleged to have done. The presidential office in Seoul didn't respond to repeated requests for further comment.

"(CNN) -- The murder case will proceed against Pedro Hernandez -- accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz, who disappeared on his way to a New York City school bus stop in 1979 -- after a judge on Wednesday denied a motion to dismiss the case, a court official said. Judge Maxwell Wiley determined that there was enough evidence for the case against Hernandez to proceed, according to the judge's clerk's office. The defendant's lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, said that while he believes Hernandez shouldn't face murder charges, he's not surprised by the decision. Missing child case 'awakened America' ""It's highly unlikely for a judge to dismiss a case like this,"" Fishbein said. Patz's plight catapulted concern for missing children to the national forefront after authorities put his image on thousands of milk cartons, a technique that would become more common in the next few years. Hernandez confessed in May 2012 to killing Patz more than three decades ago, when he was a stock clerk in Lower Manhattan. Police said Hernandez admitted he choked the boy after luring him into the basement of the bodega where he worked, which Etan would pass en route to the bus. The boy's body was then put in a garbage bag and thrown away, Hernandez allegedly told authorities. The remains were never found. Hernandez's lawyer has said his client falsely confessed, saying his statements to police ""are not reliable."" Moreover, Fishbein has claimed Hernandez was repeatedly diagnosed with schizophrenia and that he has ""an IQ in the borderline-to-mild mental retardation range."" In November, a grand jury indicted Hernandez on second-degree murder and kidnapping charges. He pleaded not guilty in court the next month.

"Washington (CNN) -- Naif Al-Mutawa anticipated a struggle when he launched an Islam-inspired comic book series that he hoped would become a symbol of tolerance. He worried about the comics being banned in Saudi Arabia - which wound up happening, briefly -- and he expected to be challenged by conservatives in Islam, since Al-Mutawa wanted to buck the trend of Islamic culture being directly tied to the Koran. But it wasn't an Islamic cleric that stalled the series, called ""The 99,"" after the 99 attributes of Allah, which the superheroes are supposed to embody. It is the American market, and the voices of Islam's Western critics, that have caused the most problems for ""The 99,"" says Al-Mutawa, who is the focus of a PBS documentary airing next week. In 2010, President Barack Obama called the comic books, which debuted in 2006, ""the most innovative response"" to America's expanding dialogue with the Muslim world, which Obama has encouraged. The series features 99 superheroes from across the globe who team up to combat villains and who embody what Al-Mutawa calls basic human values like trust and generosity. But Al-Mutawa, a Kuwaiti-born clinical psychologist and graduate of Columbia Business School, says a vocal minority have raised surprising questions about American tolerance of Islam. The idea for ""The 99"" started during a conversation in a London cab between Al-Mutawa and his sister. It took off, although slowly, after Al-Mutawa raised $7 million from 54 investors across four continents. The first issue was released during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in 2006. The comic book was quickly banned in Saudi Arabia and Al-Mutawa received threats of fatwas against him and his project from clerics. But Saudi Arabia eventually lifted the ban and the television adaptation of ""The 99"" will be aired there this year. Al-Mutawa and his team have now raised more than $40 million in venture capital for the project. But when word leaked that The Hub, a Discovery Channel cable and satellite television venture, purchased the series and planned to air it in the United States, the response from conservative bloggers and authors was swift. Pamela Geller, founder of the Atlas Shrugs blog, called the series, part of the ""ongoing onslaught of cultural jihad,"" and created a counter-comic strip that made the 19 hijackers behind the September 11, 2001 attacks the superheroes. New York Post columnist Andrea Peyser, meanwhile, urged readers to ""Hide your face and grab the kids. Coming soon to a TV in your child's bedroom is a posse of righteous, Sharia-compliant Muslim superheroes - including one who fights crime hidden head-to-toe by a burqa."" According to Al-Mutawa, the criticism spooked The Hub. ""All of a sudden we couldn't get an air date and I was asked to be patient and we have been,"" Al-Mutawa said. ""But it has been a year and the actual push-back died down."" A spokesperson for The Hub told CNN that ""'The 99' is one of the many shows we have on the possible schedule, but at this time, no decisions have been made about scheduling."" Al-Mutawa isn't shy about responding to the criticism his comics have received in the U.S. ""There is nothing different from them and the extremists in my country,"" he says. ""They are just as bad. They are just intellectual terrorists."" Geller, author of the book ""Stop the Islamization of America,"" called Al-Mutawa's statement ""ridiculous victimhood rhetoric."" ""He is the one mainstreaming oppression and discrimination,"" Geller says. ""I work for equality of rights for all people. So which one of us is the intellectual terrorist?"" Geller also takes issue with Al-Mutawa's assertion that ""The 99"" exemplifies ""moderation"" and ""toleration,"" pointing to a ""burqa-wearing superhero."" But Al-Mutawa says criticisms of burqas are evidence that, ""for some people anything to do with Islam is bad."" ""How clichÃ© is it that characters created to promote tolerance are getting shot down by extremists,"" he says. Al-Mutawa's frustrations are chronicled in the new documentary ""Wham! Bam! Islam!,"" which will air on PBS on October 13 as part of the Independent Lens series. The film's director, Isaac Solotaroff, began shooting before the comic was released. He said that one of the most surprising aspects of the story is how ""a very small group of people who scream very loud, have a disproportionate share of the public discourse when it comes to culture."" Echoing Al-Mutawa, Solotaroff calls it a case of the tail wagging the dog. He says that initial concerns of censorship in the Middle East began to change as the project progressed. ""We were waiting for a fatwa from a cleric in Saudi Arabia, Solotaroff says,"" when it ended up being the U.S. market that has been resistant to ""The 99."" ""Realizing that The 99 will not survive if focused solely on the Middle East, Al-Mutawa must now target an international and predominantly non-Muslim market,"" reads the website for ""Wham! Bam! Islam!"" Citing The Hub holdup, Solotaroff says the project is now stuck in the most important market"" for ""The 99."" Al-Mutawa is also trying to gain distribution for his TV series in France and other countries, but his main focus remains the United States. ""One way or the other,"" he says, ""'The 99' will get on air in the U.S.""","Creator of Islam-inspired comic series hoped would become a symbol of tolerance .

"New York (CNN) -- When Gina Keatley first moved to New York to attend culinary school, she noticed that many of her neighbors were missing limbs. ""I lived on 99th Street across from some projects,"" she said. ""I would walk to the train and think, 'Why are there so many amputees?'"" Keatley found out that many of them had to have amputations because of complications from diabetes. Diabetes can reduce blood flow to extremities and cause nerve damage, and sometimes amputations are necessary if serious infection sets in and there is severe damage to the tissue and bone. The neighborhood where Keatley lived, East Harlem, has the highest diabetes rate in Manhattan, according to city health officials. It also has the highest obesity rate: One-third of adult residents are obese or overweight. ""It's so shocking to me to see people who are poor and unhealthy and literally dying in the street,"" said Keatley, an award-winning chef and nutritionist. Keatley said that when she would visit more affluent neighborhoods near East Harlem, she wouldn't see nearly as many amputees. And she was pretty sure she knew why. ""You go over this invisible line, and there are people with farmers' markets, people with organic food ... healthy sandwich shops,"" she said. There's not much of that in East Harlem. Instead, the poor community is saturated with inexpensive fast food. ""These people are literally dying for nourishment,"" she said. Fresh out of college and determined to make a difference, Keatley turned down more lucrative jobs in the culinary industry to start Nourishing NYC. Since 2008, the nonprofit has provided fresh food and nutritional education -- for free -- to nearly 100,000 people in Harlem and the Bronx. Once a week, Keatley and her army of volunteers, driving in a vegetable-oil-powered truck, hand out 500 to 1,000 pounds of fresh produce to people on high-trafficked corners. The food is donated by local partners. ""If you want somebody to try a tomato, you give them a tomato,"" Keatley said. ""It's an inspiration. They have to feel it, touch it, taste it. ... ""When we work with someone who's never had a blueberry at (age) 50 and they try it ... we're opening up people to a world of culinary they've never had."" Keatley and her group also provide a recipe for how to prepare the ingredients healthfully. Sometimes they dispel myths and misconceptions. ""A lot of people, especially with diabetes ... don't even understand the basics of their own disease,"" said Keatley, 31. ""(Some) think that if you wash rice, it's no longer a carbohydrate. ... ""We have to give them the (correct) information, because ignorance spreads. One person says it, the next person says it and then everybody thinks: 'Rice isn't a carbohydrate. We can eat as much as we want.'"" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2012 CNN Heroes . Twice a week, Nourishing NYC holds nutrition classes at community gardens, shelters and nonprofit organizations that serve New York's low-income population. In the summer, it connects with children through its Junior Chef program, which partners youth with adult volunteers who teach them basic culinary skills and encourage better food choices. ""We really want them to start early on so we can set a ripple effect for the rest of their life,"" Keatley said. ""But at the end of the day, the parents are the ones doing the shopping. So we have to win them over as well."" Pedro Robles participated in the Junior Chefs summer program a year ago. Since then, the 8-year-old and his family have been frequenting their local farmers' market in East Harlem and transforming the way they eat. ""We learned more about the fruits and vegetables from the Junior Chefs class because Pedro taught us everything he learned,"" said Pedro's mother, Deborah. ""We go to the farmers' market, and he picks out all the fruits and vegetables he wants. ... Eggplant is one thing I had never tried before, and I liked it. Now we eat it all the time."" Nourishing NYC also holds events year-round. For example, there are local community gardening workshops for Earth Day, and around Thanksgiving the group distributes 1,000 free turkeys. It also assembles a special class of junior chefs who receive ingredients and instruction to prepare healthy holiday feasts for their families. This month marks the launch of Keatley's newest program, Nourishing USA, which aims to combat hunger and advocate nutrition in communities nationwide. People can apply on her organization's website to receive a free ""Hunger Advocacy Kit"" that includes seeds for 500 meals, instructions on how to grow them, and information for hosting a food drive in their own communities. ""We want people to have a food drive, but we give them instructions on how to do it and what products would be healthy,"" Keatley said. ""And most importantly, it teaches philanthropy to young children. The idea of not just giving a dollar ... but to do it with your own hands, to grow something, to connect with it, and then to distribute to people right in your neighborhood who really need it."" Keatley knows what it's like to grow up poor. From age 4 to 14, her family was homeless. She rarely went to school. But while her troubled childhood taught her to be more compassionate later on in life, it also taught her that someone's past doesn't have to determine their future. ""We don't want to let people make money an excuse and say that, 'We can't eat well because, you know, we're broke,' "" she said. ""I can feel your pain, but it's not okay to literally be committing almost daily suicide by eating bad foods, by having your children be obese. We have to work together as a team and rise above excuses. ... ""You really can eat healthy on a low budget. I don't like the connection between poverty and obesity. ... Everybody deserves a long, healthy life."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Venezuela's presidential election to pick a successor to the late Hugo Chavez will be held April 14, Venezuelan state television reported Saturday. After serving 14 years as the South American nation's leader, Chavez died Tuesday at 58 after a battle with cancer. His vice president, Nicolas Maduro, was sworn in Friday as Venezuela's acting president. In a bombastic speech at that ceremony, Maduro appealed to the opposition to field a presidential candidate. ""May the best person win,"" he said. ""The people will decide."" The official campaign period for the upcoming vote will be held April 2 to April 11, National Electoral Council President Tibisay Lucena said Saturday. Miranda State Gov. Henrique Capriles said later in the day on Twitter he is ""very thankful"" to be nominated as the main opposition candidate. He said he will speak in the coming hours about whether he'll accept the nomination. ""All agreed that Henrique Capriles is the person to embody the alternative option of change, an alternative for everyone,"" Ramon Guillermo Aveledo, a leader in the opposition coalition, said Saturday of Capriles' nomination. Earlier this week, Capriles -- who lost to Chavez in last fall's presidential election -- called Maduro's swearing in ""an abuse of power."" ""To be president, the people have to elect you,"" Capriles said. ""The constitution is very clear."" Chavez was a larger-than-life figure during his time as Venezuela's president, positioning himself as a champion of the poor who cast himself as a ""21st century socialist."" He steered much of Venezuela's vast oil wealth to social programs to end illiteracy, provide food for the poor and allow more people access to higher education. In Venezuela, will 'Chavismo' survive? Internationally, he became one of the world's most high-profile and vocal leftist leaders, as well as the United States' chief adversary in Latin America. His policies made him a polarizing figure in Venezuela, revered by legions even as others accused him of repressing dissenting voices and turning over once independent institutions to partisan loyalists. CNN's Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","NEW: Gov. Henrique Capriles ""thankful"" to be nominated as opposition candidate .

"(CNN) -- At my heaviest, I weighed 385 pounds. I never dared to dream I could run anywhere, never mind finish a half marathon. Yet on April 27, 2013, I weighed 219 pounds. At 3:30 a.m., I ate breakfast, hydrated, laced up my shoes and headed to Centennial Park in Nashville, because I was running the St. Jude Country Music Half Marathon. It had taken a village to get me to this day. This run was for Darbi, my best friend since college and her partner Anje, the two people that have taught me about the best me I can be. It was for Team Rio, the running group that became like family to me. It was for April, my CNN Fit Nation trainer. The 13.1 miles I was about to run weren't about the race itself, but about everything -- and everyone -- it took to get me there. Behind the scenes: Training for a triathlon . Anje is the biggest reason I've been able to lose more than 150 pounds. She became my trainer last June, then became one my biggest inspirations. In November 2012 Anje was diagnosed with uterine cancer. She and I had been working on getting me to my goal weight, which is how we decided to run a 5k and a half marathon in 2013. The plan was to do them together. I will never forget how scared I was, the anger I felt or the tears I cried, the day I heard her say, ""I have cancer."" With a cancer diagnosis, Anje and Darbi should've been thinking about anything except me, but that's not the kind of hearts they have. Both were worried about how this was going to affect the plans Anje and I had made. So Darbi stepped in with her ""I got this"" swagger and picked up where Anje was forced leave off. I still wonder how she did it sometimes. She would work out with me, work endlessly, go to all of Anje's doctor appointments and take care of everything at home. I know she was terrified, but never once did she complain. She's a true testament to the human spirit. Anje's doctor decided she needed a complete hysterectomy, with possible radiation and/or chemo to follow, depending on what the surgery uncovered. Surgery was set for December 26. While Anje was in surgery, I was in the waiting room with Darbi. Believe it or not, that was the same day I did my first phone interview for CNN Fit Nation. When Anje woke up from surgery, the first thing she said to me was, ""Did you talk to CNN?"" I was now training for two races. Johanna, my Team Rio running coach, made sure April got my full running training plan. April then built the half training into my triathlon training. Some days it was a bit overwhelming, but I was the one who wanted this. I knew what I had to do, so I stuck to the plan and kept running. While I was training, Anje was undergoing five weeks of radiation therapy. On April 13, I had my first true ""runner's high."" I had 12 miles to run, my longest distance before the half. The group was small that day so one of the coaches decided to run with me. We like to talk so we kept the pace conversational. Out of that run came a favorite phrase of mine: ""What's the bigger beach?"" You don't need the story behind it to understand what it means. It's asking whether you'll go for instant gratification or plan, sacrifice and work on the best possible outcome for the long run. I finished the run so inspired, feeling as if I could run another 12 miles. Get fit and others will follow . On April 27, just two days before Anje's final radiation treatment, Darbi, Anje and I ran across the finish line of the St. Jude Country Music Half Marathon hand-in-hand. We were freezing and completely soaked from the rain. All I could do was cry as they both wrapped their arms around me jumping and screaming, ""You did it!"" No, I didn't do it, I thought. WE did it! When I placed that half marathon medal around my neck, I knew it had all been worth it. I had made it to the ""bigger beach."" Every time I see the medal now, I see the village it took to earn it. Most importantly, when I see the medal, I see me living. Follow Miller on Twitter @TriHardAnnette.","Annette Miller has lost more than 150 pounds; she now weighs 219 .

"(AOL Autos) -- As we're in the midst of a trend that equates green with cool, just about every automaker is showcasing ecologically-minded concepts at the 2008 Detroit Auto Show. (Thank you Lamborghini for bucking the trend ... vehicles in their display are powered by gasoline gulping V10s and V12s.) Explorer America Concept . Wisely supporting the green trend, Ford chose to combine two important concepts in the debut of a single vehicle, the Ford Explorer America. Compared to Ford's current SUV champ (the regular production Explorer), the America concept is smaller, lighter, more efficient and more refined. Moving away from traditional truck-like body-on-frame construction, the America is a lighter-weight unitized design. The styling may be a hint at what a future Explorer might look like. But even more important than the styling is what's under the America's short hood. The V6 engine debuts a combination of technologies that delivers the fuel economy of a 4-cylinder with the power punch of a big V8. Here are the highlights of the technology that Ford will roll out in the 2009 Lincoln MKS luxury sedan; the so-called Eco-Boost engine features turbocharging and direct-injection. Readers with some automotive background know that turbocharging has been around over 100 years and that direct-injection style fuel injection is also not new. Diesel engines have positioned fuel injectors within the combustion chambers for several years.  See other hot concept cars » . However, for the first time, Ford has combined these two features on a gasoline engine. The result is an affordable line of 4- and 6-cylinder engines that deliver excellent economy, reduced emissions, and impressive power. The 3.5-liter Gasoline Turbo Direct Injection V6 in the Explorer America is claimed to produce 340 horsepower, more than the base 4.6-liter V8 in a Ford F-150 pickup truck. Ford also pointed out that while a GTDI engine is more expensive than a similar engine without GTDI, it's a technology that will pay for itself. Derrick Kuzak, Ford's group vice president in charge of Global Product Development told us, ""The EcoBoost technology is affordable. Compared with the current cost of diesel and hybrid technologies, customers can expect to recoup their initial investment in a 4-cylinder EcoBoost engine through fuel economy savings in approximately 30 months. A diesel will take the average driver 7.5 years to save enough on fuel to pay for the option, while the cost of a hybrid will take nearly 12 years of driving to recoup."" While we understand the concept of saving fuel and money, we're not exactly sure what the Explorer America's implies. Perhaps this is what Captain America would drive ... after all, there's plenty of room in this 6-passenger mid-size SUV for his shield and other members of the Justice League. Regarding names, we'd actually like to see the return of the Bronco nameplate. But we'd still let Captain America drive if he asked nicely.

"New York (CNN) -- New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg found himself facing questions Thursday about why the city was paying for more than 100 vacant hotel rooms when thousands were displaced after Superstorm Sandy. The rooms were reserved for storm victims who were pushed out of their homes by Sandy, which hit the area October 29. According to Bloomberg's office, a total of 1,014 people were housed in 416 rooms, while another 120 rooms designated as emergency housing were vacant. ""We've gone out and we've gotten housing for people in case they might need it, but the wonderful thing is we haven't needed it so far,"" Bloomberg said Thursday. ""We have hotel rooms in advance, particularly now because as you get toward the holiday season the hotel occupancy goes up, and if we need it -- and I hope we don't -- we're going to have those,"" he added. That's a surprise to Nicole Neal, whose whose apartment in the Queens neighborhood of Far Rockaway hasn't had heat or power since the storm hit. ""I would go to the hotel,"" Neal told CNN on Thursday. ""It's freezing in my apartment. I got to wear four pairs of socks every day."" Yisroel Schulman, president of the New York Legal Assistance Group, said scores of families are staying in cold, dark homes because they are concerned about looting or they don't want to pull their children from school. ""We believe strongly the minute that first snow hits, and it's really cold, these people are going to need housing,"" Schulman said. ""It's a very prudent move on apart of the city to have as much temporary housing as possible."" The city says canvassers have knocked on more than 12,600 doors to tell people that housing assistance is available for those who still lack heat, and they leave flyers on the doors of units where no one answers. Residents are being told about restoration centers where they can be connected with hotels if their heat is still out. Sandy victims outraged over business-as-usual power bills . Neal said she had not been contacted about the available hotel rooms. She has been staying with her mother in a crowded Brooklyn apartment while she awaits repairs to her apartment, where she said the walls are caving in and mold is growing on the walls. She said the Federal Emergency Management Agency has given her $1,700 and that the city took over responsibility for the housing complex she lived in because the landlord abandoned it. ""That's why I am so mad,"" she said. ""We still don't have lights. It's crazy."" Bloomberg's office said the city expects FEMA to reimburse it for the hotel rooms. FEMA spokesman Dan Watson told CNN that the agency would consider that, provided the city could provide some justification for the costs. As of Wednesday, 473,785 households in New York and New Jersey had applied for disaster relief assistance with FEMA. While not all of the families were requesting housing assistance, officials said they continue to work with state and local officials to help all victims of the deadly storm. Meanwhile, the agency started exploring the possibility of housing some displaced residents on boats, posting a request for information in hopes of finding rapid, cost-effective housing options on small vessels. Opinion: Let's not forget superstorm victims . FEMA said the purpose of the request was for market research only and to explore whether the maritime industry could offer viable options for residents who remain homeless. Officials said the vessels they requested ideally would sleep two to six adults, either as stand-alone boats or interconnected to create a single dwelling made of multiple units. The request for information specifically said the agency isn't looking for cruise ships as a solution to the crisis caused by the colossal storm that pounded the Northeast last month. FEMA faced criticism from residents and politicians for its decision to house first responders and emergency personnel on cruise ships docked in New Orleans and other cities after Hurricane Katrina. Sandy slammed ashore near Atlantic City, New Jersey after forming in the Caribbean and sweeping northward, killing a total of 182 people from Haiti to Canada. It caused widespread flooding and damage and destroyed or damaged more than 30,000 homes and businesses in New Jersey alone, state officials said. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said the latest estimates of Sandy-related storm costs in his state were $36.8 billion, while New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters earlier this week the total cost in his state was $41 billion.","NEW: New York paying for vacant hotel rooms for storm victims .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. military is considering the mandatory evacuation of thousands of American troops and their families in Japan out of concern over rising radiation levels, a senior defense official tells CNN. The official, who did not want to be on the record talking about ongoing deliberations, says there are no discussions to evacuate all U.S. troops across the country. The talks have focused exclusively on U.S. troops in Yokosuka, just south of Tokyo, the official said. Yokosuka is home to America's largest naval base in Japan. The military is monitoring radiation levels on a constant basis. As of Monday, the U.S. Navy had no more warships in port at the base. The aircraft carrier USS George Washington, which had been undergoing maintenance in Yokosuka, left port Monday to get away from the plume of radioactive particles that could blow over the base. Because it left port with a much smaller than normal crew, the George Washington will not take part in the Japanese relief effort. The official said the talks originated with Pacific Command, the military authority that directly oversees U.S. troops in the region, but ""discussions have since taken place here in Washington as well."" The official told CNN this is strictly a contingency plan, and could be accomplished ""if they needed to do it in a hurry, with gray tails,"" or large military transport planes like a C-17. CBS News first reported that the evacuations were being considered. A second defense official at Pacific Command, who would not go on the record for the same reason, would only say they ""are monitoring the situation, and will continue to do so and keep our families informed. Prudent planning always happens."" An official statement released by U.S. Pacific Command, which oversees all military operations in Asia, states that the only evacuations being performed now are under State Department guidelines, which calls for voluntary evacuations of military family members, paid for by the U.S. government. A flight carrying 154 military family members left Japan Monday, flying into Seattle/Tacoma International Airport, according to Lt. Commander Bill Lewis, a spokesman for U.S. Northern Command. That followed a flight that departed Saturday with 230 people on board. CNN's Laurie Ure and Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.","Contingency plans being discussed, defense official says .

"(CNN) -- The Boy Scouts of America announced Tuesday it has affirmed its policy of ""not granting membership to open or avowed homosexuals."" The organization's leaders reached that decision after a nearly two-year evaluation and will take no further action on a resolution that has sought a change in policy, it said in a news release. It had said last month that it would consider a resolution asking that local units be allowed to determine their own standards. BSA's chief scout executive and national president had convoked a committee of volunteers and professional leaders to evaluate the policy. Boy Scouts to study ban on gay leaders . ""The committee's work and conclusion is that this policy reflects the beliefs and perspectives of the BSA's members, thereby allowing Scouting to remain focused on its mission and the work it is doing to serve more youth,"" the statement said. ""The vast majority of the parents of youth we serve value their right to address issues of same-sex orientation within their family, with spiritual advisers, and at the appropriate time and in the right setting,"" said Bob Mazzuca, BSA's chief scout executive. ""While a majority of our membership agrees with our policy, we fully understand that no single policy will accommodate the many diverse views among our membership or society."" In a prepared statement, the executive committee of the BSA National Executive Board said, ""While not all board members may personally agree with this policy, and may choose a different direction for their own organizations, BSA leadership agrees this is the best policy for the organization and supports it for the BSA."" The deputy executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Darlene Nipper, issued a statement calling the decision ""deeply disappointing."" ""Once again, officials of the Boy Scouts of America have turned their backs on a chance to demonstrate fairness, exercise sound judgment, and serve as a role model for valuing others, free of bias and prejudice,"" she said. ""This is deeply disappointing. Discrimination is never the right policy, period."" The exclusion of openly gay members goes for scoutmasters, too. A 2000 U.S. Supreme Court decision found that a New Jersey law requiring the national organization to readmit an openly gay scoutmaster infringed on the organization's First Amendment right of expressive association. ""Forcing a group to accept certain members may impair the ability of the group to express those views, and only those views, that it intends to express,"" then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote. He added that the decision was not meant to approve or condemn the Scouts' membership policy.

"(CNN) -- Internet connections across Syria went down Tuesday night, according to several global monitoring sites. Google reported that its services became inaccessible in Syria around 9:45 p.m. (2:45 p.m. ET). The Renesys, Akamai and BGPmon Internet tracking companies also reported the loss of Syrian Internet connectivity at that time. ""It seems Syria has largely disappeared from the Internet,"" Dan Hubbard, chief technology officer for Umbrella Security Labs, wrote in a blog post about the apparent outage. The website for Syria's state-run news agency and several government websites were not accessible. CNN staff in Damascus could not connect to the Internet. At one hotel, staffers said the Internet was down ""in the hotel and all of Damascus."" Opposition activists reported widespread power and Internet outages in Damascus and throughout the country, warning that the communications cutoff could be an ominous sign. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said the activist network would put ""all responsibility on regime forces for any violation or massacres against civilians."" The cause of the apparent outage was unclear. ""Although we can't yet comment on what caused this outage, past incidents were linked to both government-ordered shutdowns and damage to the infrastructure, which included fiber cuts and power outages,"" Hubbard wrote. After a similar situation in November, U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford told CNN that Syria had shut down the Internet in the past. ""The Syrian government has been monitoring (the Internet) for years,"" he said. ""They have been using the Internet with Iranian assistance to track opposition activists, arrest and kill them."" ""That is the reason why our nonlethal assistance to the Syrian opposition, we put a special emphasis on communications equipment precisely to help the Syrian people tell the world what is going on inside Syria,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Of all the scenarios firefighters train for, confronting a hostage-taker might not seem to be high on the list. Or suddenly dodging a sniper's deadly aim. But training and keeping calm apparently did come into play Wednesday when four Gwinnett County, Georgia, firefighters became hostages while a gunman held off authorities. The situation ended with the firefighters free and the gunman dead at the hands of police. That incident highlighted a fact of life for firefighters -- their life-saving work can sometimes put them in the middle of criminal situations. The Georgia event is akin to last year's New York state incident in which a sniper ambushed and killed two firefighters responding to his burning home, one expert said Thursday. Firefighters are trained to call police if they sense a potentially violent situation, but the Georgia and New York episodes involved surprise attacks. Police: Hostage taker gave us no choice . ""It's almost impossible to prepare for that situation if there's no indication of any potential threat,"" said Philip Stittleburg, chairman of the National Volunteer Fire Council and the National Fire Protection Association. ""Tragic as these situations are, they are relatively rare,"" Stittleburg added. For sure, local firefighters will now be working with extra vigilance, said Capt. Tommy Rutledge of Gwinnett County Fire and Emergency Services. The hostage-taking incident occurred after firefighters entered the home of a man in response to a medical call. All 850 of the county's firefighters are already cross-trained as emergency medical technicians, and many are also paramedics, Rutledge said. ""Yesterday was an element of surprise to that crew,"" Rutledge said Thursday. ""How do you train for that? It heightens our awareness and it shows that things like that can occur. ""Will they look for triggers that something might be wrong as they approach? Yes,"" he said. While held hostage, the Gwinnett County firefighters kept calm and, as importantly, worked to keep the gunman calm, Rutledge said. ""Luckily our personnel are trained on how to not only keep themselves calm but keep the individual calm,"" Rutledge said. ""No doubt their calm composure brought about a successful closure for the fire department personally. ""It's unfortunate that the individual lost his life but as the police said, he was in control and he could have let those firefighters go and he's responsible for his action and the ultimate ending,"" Rutledge added. Jim Schwartz, chairman of the terrorism and homeland security committee of the International Association of Fire Chiefs, said fire departments must communicate more with their police partners on how to handle scenarios such as the ones in Georgia and New York. Schwartz described firefighters' current training on operational security -- measures to protect themselves -- as ""less than adequate."" ""It really does need to go to a new level -- these conversations where I'm asking my police chief (to) help me with what we need to understand going into a situation that could turn as bad as Gwinnett County and New York,"" said Schwartz, who's also chief of the Arlington County, Virginia, Fire Department. Some fire and police agencies around the country are already sharing such information, Schwartz said. For the past four years, his fire department has been ""tightly integrated with police,"" Schwartz said. ""There isn't a law enforcement officer who doesn't go into every situation without suspicions on how that situation could turn on them and pose a threat to them,"" Schwartz said. ""For the average firefighter and EMT, that isn't foremost on their minds. ""What we're seeing, certainly out of these two incidents, more and more of what we would consider a standard response to EMS and fire emergencies can go horribly wrong. We need to think about what are the other dimensions to this crisis that the routines do not suggest,"" he said. Firefighters around the country are instructed on how to respond to violent scenarios -- wait for police to secure the scene so that the firefighters can do their jobs saving lives and property -- but that instruction presumes the firefighter has already noticed something amiss, Stittleburg said. If that's noticed inside a home, a firefighter keeps a close eye on the suspicious person -- and especially where that person is, he said. ""The kitchen is the most dangerous place for them to be if they are acting abnormally because that's where they keep the knives and the pan of hot grease on the stove,"" Stittleburg said. ""There's lot of things that people can hurt you with in the kitchen."" But instruction is more difficult in those fire calls where ""you step off a truck and someone shoots when there is no likelihood of violence,"" he said. ""I don't know how you deal with that one,"" added Stittleburg, who's also chief of the La Farge, Wisconsin, Fire Department, an all-volunteer agency. In the last 10 years or so, however, firefighters are increasingly being cross-training to become certified police officers assigned to SWAT teams, Stittleburg said. In an era of high body-count mass shootings since Colorado's Columbine High School massacre in 1999, police departments are demanding their SWAT teams include a firefighter with emergency medical service skills, Stittleburg said. ""EMS skills are certainly one of the important skills that you would want on that SWAT team -- primarily for law enforcement, primarily for the SWAT team members,"" Stittleburg said. ""We have people who are EMS folks, whose primary mission is to take care of the wounded, to be almost in a position of military corpsman or medic,"" he said. ""It's kind of sad that things have taken a turn that creates the need for this,"" he added.","Training can hardly thwart a surprise gunman or hostage-taker, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- It's that time of year again. This weekend, you'll sacrifice an hour of sleep in exchange for a few months of extra daylight. Daylight Saving Time officially started at 2 a.m. on Sunday. If you haven't set your clocks forward yet, do it before you return to work on Monday. Daylight Saving Time ends the first Sunday in November. Benjamin Franklin first thought up the idea of daylight saving in 1784. It wasn't instituted until World War I, when it went into effect to save energy used for lights. The Standard Time Act established time zones and daylight saving in 1918, but it was short-lived. Daylight saving was repealed the following year. Daylight Saving Time may bring health problems . The Uniform Time Act of 1966 established Daylight Saving Time throughout the United States and gave states the option to exempt themselves. Hawaii and most of Arizona do not follow Daylight Saving Time. Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and American Samoa also skip out on the clock-changing fun. In 1974 and 1975, Congress extended daylight saving to save energy during the energy crisis. In 2007, Daylight Saving got a few weeks longer, running from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November. About 70 countries around the world observe daylight saving, but many countries near the equator do not. It's not universally popular, though. Farmers note that their livestock don't live by a clock, and complain that they have to adjust their working hours to deal with the animals. Also, any parent will tell you -- babies don't quite get it either. Which do you prefer -- more daylight or more sleep? Weigh in below.","Set your clocks forward today .

"(CNN)  -- They may wear a uniform, or ordinary street clothes. Their numbers are unclear. They rush the streets with brute strength. Members of the Basij militia enter Tehran University, where students were protesting on Monday. They are the Basij, Iran's volunteer paramilitary group that for more than a week has cracked down on the thousands of protesters in the bloody aftermath of the Islamic republic's disputed presidential election. Amateur video shows members of the Basij, wearing plain shirts and pants and wielding clubs and hoses, dispersing protesters and beating a handful of Iranians at a time. ""The Basij militia forces tried to break up the demonstrations using batons, electric shock and water cannons,"" a student in Tehran, whose name was withheld for his safety, told CNN's Don Lemon on Sunday. The student said he was injured at a protest by the feared militia. Monday's demonstrators dismissed a warning from the Revolutionary Guard that people who ""disturb the peace and stand up to security forces"" would be met with a strong response. ""The guardians of the Islamic revolution and the courageous Basiji together with the security forces are following the orders of the supreme leader and following him unquestioningly,"" the Guard said, according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.  Watch protesters clash with Basij militia » . While the Basij -- the word means ""mobilization"" in the Farsi language -- is often described by outsiders as shadowy and mysterious, Iranians have had run-ins with the militia for three decades. The Basij was established in 1979 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who famously declared that Iran could never be destroyed with a 20-million-man militia. Khomeini, who ushered in the Islamic revolution that ousted Iran's ruling shah 30 years ago, felt that his country suffered from Western influences that the shah embraced. He created the Basij as a popular auxiliary arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, a military unit under the direct control of Iran's supreme leader, to defend the principles of the movement. The group, at least at first, was made up of men either too old or young to serve in the Revolutionary Guard. Until now, they were perhaps best known for the ""human wave"" attacks during the Iran-Iraq war that reportedly cleared out minefields for the professional military. Many of the Basij reportedly received plastic keys to wear around their necks like dog tags, marking their entry to ""paradise"" when they died in martyrdom. ""Basij members made up with zeal what they lacked in military professionalism,"" said Michael Eisenstadt, a senior fellow and director of The Washington Institute's Military and Security Studies Program. After the Iran-Iraq war, the Basij returned to its role as an internal security force to enforce Islamic morality. While Iran in recent years has claimed more than 12 million in the ranks of the group, Middle East experts put the figure closer to 300,000 -- though they concede it's difficult to quantify a sprawling militia that has full-time and reservist cadres. The militia is known to recruit members from rural and urban areas and to organize mainly at mosques around Tehran and other major cities.  Watch report on Basij militia » . ""Through the mosques, they have funds, ideological and political indoctrination and military training,"" said Ali Alfoneh, a fellow at the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute who has researched the relationship between Iranian civilians and the Revolutionary Guard. The Basij has had a growing role since 2003, when it was beefed up as a first line of defense amid suspicions of a possible U.S.-led invasion, Eisenstadt said . ""I think cannon fodder is a fair way to characterize them,"" said Eisenstadt, who noted the militia seems to emerge during the initial moments of an uprising as the Revolutionary Guard and law enforcement forces organized their reaction.  See timeline of events in Iran » . While experts say there is a hardline ideological core to Basij, its members, who often come from lower-class backgrounds, are attracted to the perks that the Basij (and its superior agency, the Revolutionary Guard) has to offer: a little cash, a seat at a university and a bit of authority. ""Not every single one is devout, not every single one is ready to kill,"" said Alfoneh, a native of Iran. The Basij noticeably took the lead in crowd control last week when tens of thousands of Iranian demonstrators spilled into the streets of Tehran to protest the presidential election. Iran's election authority declared hardline incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as the winner of the presidential race, sparking outrage in supporters of popular opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi. ""The first people who were really available were the Basij,"" Eisenstadt told CNN. ""There are Basij bases throughout the city and beyond, and they were able to respond quickly."" As the government got a handle on the massive demonstrations in recent days, the Basij remains present and vigilant in the aftermath of the June 12 election. Badi Badiozamani, an Iran analyst, has sifted through scores of amateur video from the frontlines of the protests. Dozens of those clips show Basij members, wearing black shirts and pants or plainclothes with camouflaged vests, detaining young men outside their homes as their mothers and sisters scream in the background. One clip shows a young man whose head is hooded in a dark cloth, squatting behind a car, while another man is shown face down with his hands tied behind his back. ""We saw that these forces took the detained person out into the alley, and into an unmarked car,"" Badiozamani said. ""Today I saw again Basijis grab a young man, put him on a unmarked motorcycle and take him away.""","Mysterious militia was established in 1979 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini .

"(CNN) -- Saturday's funeral for legendary pop singer Whitney Houston is expected to be made available for television and web streaming from the New Jersey church where she grew up, Houston's publicist said Wednesday. The services, to be held at New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, will be in a much smaller, more intimate setting than the concert halls and arenas Houston packed during her heyday. In every sense, she will be going home. Publicists and entertainers by Wednesday had confirmed nearly a dozen celebrities and personalities will be in some of the 1,500 coveted, ""invitation-only"" seats. Actor Kevin Costner, who starred with Houston in the movie ""The Bodyguard,"" will speak, and singers Stevie Wonder and Aretha Franklin -- Houston's godmother -- will perform, according to a source with knowledge of the funeral plans. Gospel singer and pastor Marvin L. Winans, a longtime friend of the Houston family, will give the eulogy at New Hope Baptist Church. Winans officiated at Houston's 1992 marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown. Asked why no public memorial service was planned, Winans told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night the family didn't ""want to have a parade."" ""I don't think knowing Cissy (Houston's mother) and the Houston family ... it was a matter of public or private as it was this is my daughter, this is my sister, this is my mother, this is my friend and we want to do this with dignity."" The family's thinking, Winans told ""AC360,"" is ""we loved her when she was Nippy (a nickname) in New Jersey. The world loves her because of her voice. But if Nippy could not sing, the Houston family would love her."" Although the family is not commenting on Houston's burial location, her death certificate filed Wednesday in Los Angeles lists it as Fairview Cemetery in Westfield, New Jersey. A message left by CNN with the cemetery office was not immediately returned. Others confirmed on the guest list are Chaka Khan, Bebe & CeCe Winans, songwriter Diane Warren, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, pop singer Darlene Love, Bishop T.D. Jakes, Antonio ""L.A."" Reid, Ray J and Brandy. Houston's cousin, singer Dionne Warwick, was in New Jersey helping the family with funeral arrangements, Warwick's publicist said . Chaka Khan was a close friend of Houston. Reid produced many of Houston's songs and Jakes co-produced Houston's last film, ""Sparkle,"" which is scheduled to be released this summer. Houston and Jakes are listed as producers. Ray J, a hip-hop artist, and Houston dated off and on after she was divorced from Brown. Jackson and the Winans music family have been very close friends of the Houstons. Composer-singer Valerie Simpson of the duo Ashford & Simpson told CNN's Susan Candiotti she will attend the funeral. ""She was like family,"" Simpson said of Houston, ""somebody who I watched from the time she was young."" Simpson, who with her late partner Nick Ashford wrote ""I'm Every Woman,"" said Houston ""took it to such heights. I remember that on the video, she was pregnant and never looked more beautiful."" Houston and Brown had a daughter, Bobbi Christina Brown, who is now 18. Houston, 48, was found dead in the bathtub of her suite at the Beverly Hilton on Saturday, hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammys bash at the Beverly Hills, California, hotel. Speculation has grown over the cause of her death, which has not been determined pending the outcome of toxicology tests that could take weeks. The entertainer's trials and tribulations should not be the focus now, Simpson said. ""Those are not her records, those are not her music."" CNN's Jennifer Wolfe, Denise Quan and K.J.

"(CNN) -- Chile has only ever won 13 medals in the history of the Olympics -- and three of them are tucked safely away in Fernando Gonzalez's closet. The 32-year-old, who retired from tennis in March, was famed for his fearsome forehand during 13 years on the pro circuit, winning 11 ATP Tour titles. However, it is the full set of medals from the Games that he counts as his finest achievement in the sport. The Athens Olympics of 2004 yielded gold in the men's doubles with partner Nicolas Massu, and a bronze in the singles as his compatriot won that competition too -- becoming the only man to claim both titles at the same Games. Four years later, in Beijing, Gonzalez reached the showpiece singles final but was thwarted in his bid for a second gold by Rafael Nadal. While the Spaniard was not able to defend his title at London 2012 due to injury, Gonzalez returned to the world's biggest sporting extravaganza in an ambassadorial role. Federer focused on Olympic 'dream' ""I always wanted to play the Olympics,"" he told CNN's Open Court. ""I got there with Nicolas thinking that of course it will be a really tough competition, but the main thing in tennis is that you always have a chance to win even if you are fourth in the world going against number one. It is not like the other sports. ""It was something really special to us because we had been used to the tour and spending time with the other tennis players, but this time we were with other athletes and it was very exciting because you could see the different kinds of bodies in the same place."" Gonzalez and Massu's gold rush provoked a surge of pride and patriotism back in Chile, which the pair could only get a true taste of when they returned home as national heroes. That they had to wait over a month to feel the country's full embrace, due to the U.S. Open coming swiftly after the Games, only made their homecoming more sweet. ""When we went back three or four weeks later it was huge,"" said the man dubbed ""Gonzo"" and ""Stone Hand."" ""The president received us at the government palace. We had breakfast with him and we went out unto the balcony, which is a very popular background where very few people walk out on. ""And there was a lot of people, a few thousand people. It was very exciting and I never dreamed that tennis could give me the chance to have that experience."" Tsonga makes Olympic tennis history after marathon match . After his heroics in 2004, Gonzalez had the ultimate honor bestowed upon him prior to the start of the Beijing Games when he was asked to carry Chile's flag for the opening ceremony. ""It was one of my best moments because you are an ambassador for your country in the world,"" he said. ""For me it feels like to win something important. It is really huge."" The only other tennis player to fulfill the same role for his nation in China was 17-time grand slam champion Roger Federer, who defeated Gonzalez in the only major final he ever made -- at the 2007 Australian Open. Gonzalez turned professional in 1999 and took his first ATP Tour title the year after, his rapier-like forehand cementing his reputation as one of the hottest young players on the circuit. He reached his first grand slam quarterfinal in 2005 at Wimbledon and made the season-ending ATP Tour Finals, contested by the world's top eight players. He subsequently made the last eight of every major tournament, while the four titles he clinched on home soil, in Vina del Mar, also rank as a career highlight. Venus Williams exits singles at London 2012 . But it is the success Gonzalez has enjoyed on the international stage that has come to define his career, both in a litany of Davis Cup matches with Chile and at the Olympics. Despite the country's fervent love of football, Gonzalez always had his heart set on a career on the baseline rather than the touchline. ""In the beginning I just wanted to see tennis. I went to go see some cups and I feel the passion of the sport and then I went to see the national team of football, but I always wanted to go and play tennis. ""Then one thing led to another and I wanted to play tennis and I wanted to represent my country and you know the passion that the people of Chile gave me was really important for my career."" It has been less than six months since Gonzalez called time on his career and, though he says he doesn't miss the grueling travels schedule and endless hotel pit-stops, the Chilean admits he will miss that feeling of being on court in front of thousands of fans. But his dual love for the game and his country will also dominate his future, as he plans to help promote tennis in Chile through his foundation and broaden access for those who haven't had the chance to play. ""In Chile there is a lot of talent but maybe the people do not know they have the talent. There are many good football players playing in Europe at a really good level and I think in tennis we can do something similar,"" he said. ""Not like them, but we can do really well. But also I want to be involved in tennis. I have a few offers to start to work with but I want to take my time. ""It is the first time in my life to have enough time for me, so I'm going to start next year. I love tennis and I will stay around."" And as for his most treasured possessions, where does he keep his hat-trick of Olympic medals? ""They are at my house in the closet,"" he replies. ""Some people come to my house and say, 'Show me them,' but they don't care about the rest, they care about the medals.""","Fernando Gonzalez has won three Olympics medals out of Chile's total haul of 13 .

"(CNN) -- Hyperbolic North Korean threats of war are not new. What is new is the intensity and persistence of those threats this time around. Add to that an untested 29-year-old leader who is suddenly a four-star general with lots to prove. How does this end? Consider these three possibilities: . 1. What Kim Jong Un hopes:  North Korean threats continue to escalate. Pyongyang renews earlier threats to transfer its ""nuclear deterrent capability"" to third parties in the Middle East and declares South Korean waters west of the peninsula an open fire zone. The South Korean stock market plummets. Chinese leaders begin to panic about instability on their border. Washington is desperate to set aside the North Korea problem while dealing with a parallel crisis in Iran. The North proposes negotiations on a peace treaty formally ending the Korean War, but only if international sanctions imposed on the regime after their previous nuclear and missile tests are suspended. Washington, Seoul and Tokyo reluctantly agree to the North's terms to avoid further escalation. Meanwhile, the North continues miniaturizing uranium-based nuclear weapons in underground facilities. One year later, they test a more sophisticated warhead design and improved missiles payload. The North then demands the end of remaining international sanctions, recognition as a legitimate nuclear weapons state and a summit meeting in Pyongyang between Kim and President Barack Obama. To back up its threat, the North shells several South Korean islands and threatens to use its newly enhanced nuclear capability if the South retaliates. The crisis resumes, but with the North more dangerous. This has more or less been the pattern thus far. 2. What Washington, Seoul and Tokyo hope:  Kim's unpredictability finally turns the North's erstwhile ally, China, firmly against the regime. Intensifying U.S.-Japan-South Korean defense cooperation demonstrates how North Korean actions are isolating China within the region. Beijing vows to step up pressure on the regime and stops all inbound North Korean ships and planes for inspections based on U.N. Security Council resolutions. Opinion: Why North Korea worries Dick Cheney . When Kim tries to escalate again, Beijing cuts oil shipments to the North by 50% (China's food and fuel shipments keep the small North Korean economy afloat). The North agrees to a moratorium on testing of missiles and nuclear weapons and to resume earlier negotiations on denuclearization. Those talks move at a glacial pace because the North sees nuclear weapons as its only means of regime survival. But Kim's obvious mismanagement of the confrontation has discredited him in front of his generals. Fissures open, and the regime begins slowly to unravel. Careful U.S. and South Korean coordination with China throughout the crisis lays the basis for a managed unification of the peninsula, removal of the North's nuclear and WMD arsenal, and freedom for millions of North Koreans. 3. What everyone fears most:  Kim's escalation strategy fails to cause the other powers to recognize the North as a legitimate nuclear weapons state or to ease sanctions. The young leader and his advisers continue searching for threats that will terrify the South and cause China to provide further bribes for good behavior, but without provoking a massive U.S. attack on the North. The exuberant but inexperienced Kim approves live artillery fire on uninhabited mountains just outside the South Korean capital of Seoul. The South responds with limited counterbattery fire against the North Korean artillery units. Opinion: Does N. Korea think U.S. is soft? Aware that it cannot surrender or win, the North opens broader and deadlier artillery and missile broadsides against the South. Knowing that these forward deployed artillery and missile forces pose the greatest threat to the South if not taken out, U.S. and South Korean forces hammer North Korean emplacements north of the DMZ. The conflict ends with defeat of North Korean forces and decapitation of the North Korean leadership through massive airstrikes, but the damage to South Korea and Japan, which is within missile range, is appalling. How does this end? Right now we are somewhere between the first two scenarios -- and could remain ambiguously so for some time. The third scenario remains highly unlikely, though not impossible. The first scenario is tempting for some, because it would temporarily ease tensions, but in the long run it makes the third scenario more likely and much more lethal. That means that U.S. policy has to focus on realizing scenario two. The North's brazen actions make that more possible than ever. But it means not blinking. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Green.","Michael Green: North Korea more threatening than usual; three scenarios may play out .
1. Nuke threats grow; regime will get U.S. to lift sanctions; regime returns to same tactics .
2. China will turn on North, cut it off; Kim will lose power; North and South reunite sans nukes .
3. Kim will fire on South; U.S. will get involved; North will fall; Japan, South Korea ravaged ."
"Washington (CNN) -- Could the Boston Marathon bombing have been prevented? That was the question legislators tried to answer at Thursday's House Committee on Homeland Security hearing, where the members of Congress asked a former senator, Boston's top cop and two experts on public safety about whether or not the intelligence community dropped the ball when they closed an investigation into one of the alleged Boston bombers before the marathon bombing in April. In opening the hearing, Republican Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the committee chairman, said he feared ""the Boston bombers may have succeeded because our system failed. We can and we must do better."" ""We learned over a decade ago the danger in failing to connect the dots,"" McCaul said, referring to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. One of the alleged culprits in the Boston bombing, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was investigated by the FBI after the agency received a tip from Russian authorities that the suspect could be radicalizing. Tamerlan, along with his 19-year-old brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, allegedly carried out the April 15 marathon bombing, which killed three people and left 264 people wounded. Russian intelligence services asked the FBI to investigate Tamerlan Tsarnaev in 2011 over a possible association with terror groups. They later also asked the CIA. After receiving a tip, the FBI investigated Tsarnaev and, at the time, didn't find that he was engaging in any extremist activity. Boston bombing suspect's body entombed in undisclosed location . The FBI said a three-month probe turned up nothing derogatory about Tsarnaev. The agency also said the Russians never responded to requests for more details. The case was closed. Tamerlan Tsarnaev's name was put on a Customs and Border Protection list to alert officials in case he left the country and the CIA also asked that his name be added to another file, the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment list, which contains more than 700,000 names of suspected foreign and domestic terrorists. ""Based on what I've seen so far, the FBI performed its duties, the Department of Homeland Security did what it was supposed to be doing,"" President Barack Obama has said. Former Sen. Joe Lieberman, one of four witnesses at the hearing, told legislators that ""though it would not have been easy, it was possible to prevent the terrorist attacks in Boston."" Lieberman, who pushed for the creation of the Department of Homeland Security after the 9/11 attacks, said that post-9/11 reforms have worked well to protect Americans, but they are not perfect. Boston Police Commissioners Edward Davis echoed Lieberman's sentiment. ""The truth of the matter is nobody bats a thousand,"" the commissioner said. ""I think that as a nation we need to come to terms with it and do everything we can to prevent it, but also recognize that fusion centers and intelligence analysis and joint terrorism task forces are part of our future,"" Davis said. ""The world is a dangerous place and I think we need to recognize that and be prepared for it."" Bomb suspect's friend out on bail, released to mom . Republican lawmakers in particular were critical of the FBI for not following up on its initial investigation of Tsarnaev. In an exchange with McCaul, Davis acknowledged that if he had known about the initial FBI investigation, he would have done things differently. ""If you'd had this information before the bombing, would you have done -- your police force and you -- would you have done anything differently,"" McCaul asked. ""That's very hard to say,"" answered Davis. ""We would certainly look at the information, we would certainly talk to the individual. "" McCaul continued to press Davis, asking ""but if you knew of a Russian intelligence warning that this man's an extremist and made travel overseas and the fact that he did travel overseas and came back into the United States, would that may not have caused you to give this individual a second look?"" ""Absolutely,"" said Davis. In apparent response to the idea that the FBI did not inform Boston police of the investigation, the bureau issued a statement Thursday from Boston Special Agent in Charge Richard DesLauriers, saying the information was available. The Boston Police Department has representatives on the Boston-area Joint Terrorism Task Force, he said, and all task force members can access Guardian, ""a web-based counterterrorism incident management application that was launched in July 2004."" All task force members ""are able to perform customized key word searches of Guardian to identify relevant"" assessment of suspects, he said. The assessment of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of about 1,000 conducted by the Boston task force in 2011, was ""documented"" in the Guardian database and ""was thorough, comprehensive and fully compliant with law and policy,"" DesLauriers said. He noted that the task force is limited by law in ""the types of investigative methods"" it can use when there are no specific accusations. In addition to revisiting the FBI's initial investigation into Tsarnaev, Davis used his testimony to say the Boston Marathon bombing is further proof the United States must strengthen vulnerable targets without violating civil liberties. Before a hearing convened by the House Committee on Homeland Security, Davis submitted lengthy written testimony that touches on what worked and what didn't in the response to the Boston bombing. In that testimony, Davis argues that in order to defend soft targets -- locations that are not armored or are largely undefended -- law enforcement agencies need to ""deploy more assets including technology, cameras, undercover officers and specialized units."" ""It is clear after these events and other types of mass casualties such as those which have happened in our nation's schools and colleges that we need to continue to harden soft targets, especially events that lend themselves toward large gatherings celebratory in nature,"" Davis wrote. However, Davis cautioned against overstepping the bounds of security. ""I do not endorse actions that move Boston and our nation into a police state mentality, with surveillance cameras attached to every light pole in the city,"" he said. After the bombing, Davis became the face of the response. Almost every legislator who asked questions in Thursday's hearing thanked him for his service. Davis used that high-profile response as proof that reforms to the nation's video surveillance are needed, writing that in order to catch the bombers, law enforcement officials rely ""almost exclusively on the support of our business partners to provide critical video surveillance along the finish line."" ""I strongly support the enhanced ability to monitor public places,"" he wrote. ""This monitoring, which been upheld by the United States Supreme Court, violates no constitutionally protected rights but gives police the ability to investigate and effectively prosecute. Images from cameras do not lie. They do not forget. They can be viewed by a jury as evidence of what occurred."" In the hunt for the Tsarnaev brothers, surveillance video proved crucial. Investigators solicited video from many of the business around the marathon route and used it to locate the bombing suspects. On April 18, the FBI released surveillance-camera pictures of the brothers. The final 24 hours that paralyzed Boston . Although Thursday's meeting is the first congressional hearing on the Boston bombing, it certainly will not be the last. Legislators in both the Senate and the House have expressed an interest in hosting experts to discuss what to learn from the terrorist attack. The Boston bombing saga began after the two bombs went off at the Boston Marathon finish line on Boylston Street on April 15. Hundreds of Boston law enforcement officers then began a gripping week long search for those who carried out the terrorist attack. Late at night on April 18, Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier was shot and killed on campus, allegedly by the bombing suspects. In the early morning of April 19, the suspects allegedly hijacked a car in Cambridge and led police on a high speed chase through Cambridge and Watertown, two Boston suburbs. In a shootout during the chase, the older Tsarnaev brother was wounded by gunfire. He later died at a hospital. Throughout much of that day, hundreds of law enforcement officers went door-to-door on 20 streets in Watertown, looking for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Residents around Boston were asked by authorities to stay inside as the hunt continues for the suspect. In the early evening of April 19, David Henneberry discovered Tsarnaev, wounded, hiding in his boat. He alerted police, and after a tense standoff, police took him into custody. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was in serious condition at the time of his capture, is now stable and charged with one count of using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death and one count of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death. In addition to Tsarnaev, three 19-year-olds -- Azamat Tazhayakov, Dias Kadyrbayev, and Robel Phillipos -- were arrested in connection with the bombings. The three are accused of helping Tsarnaev after the bombing by taking items from his dorm room in an effort to keep them from investigators.

"(CNN) -- The number of women dying of pregnancy and childbirth-related complications has been cut nearly in half over the past two decades, reflecting important and hard-won gains in improving access to family planning and maternal health across the world. The annual number of maternal deaths worldwide dropped from more than 543,000 to 287,000, according to a report, ""Trends in Maternal Mortality: 1990-2010,"" released last month by the World Health Organization, the U.N. Population Fund, UNICEF and the World Bank. This is good news to celebrate Wednesday, which is World Population Day. From these latest estimates, we can see that investments in improving access to reproductive health are bearing fruit. Although things are moving in the right direction, there is an urgent need to do more. Every day, some 800 women die in pregnancy or childbirth from complications that are very often preventable, such as severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy and unsafe abortion. For every woman who dies, a further 20 women suffer debilitating childbirth injuries, such as obstetric fistulas. As the lead U.N. agency for sexual and reproductive health, we at UNFPA are working closely with the U.N. secretary-general's Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health and the Every Woman, Every Child initiative, which involves sister U.N. agencies, governments, businesses and foundations in working toward saving the lives of 16 million women and children by 2015. We have the tools for preventing these tragedies. Measures such as expanding access to voluntary family planning, investing in health workers with midwifery skills and ensuring access to emergency obstetric care when complications arise have been shown time and again to work. These interventions not only help save lives, but also support the healthy development of families, communities and nations. Ninety-nine percent of maternal deaths happen in the developing world, where millions of women are still denied even the most basic levels of care during pregnancy. Thirty-six of the 40 countries with the highest maternal death rates are in sub-Saharan Africa. In that region, the lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 39. In the United States, it is 1 in 2,400. In Sweden, it is 1 in 14,100. Yet many countries have shown remarkable commitments to reversing these trends and ensuring that women have access to skilled health care during pregnancy and childbirth, regardless of where they live. Ten countries so far, including Nepal, Lithuania and Vietnam, have already met the Millennium Development Goal target of reducing maternal deaths from 1990 levels by 75% by 2015. Another nine countries, including Eritrea and Bangladesh, are on track for meeting their targets. In other regions, we already know what needs to be done. Fortunately, the new data also show us where to target our efforts. Two countries account for a full third of all maternal deaths: India with 56,000 deaths and Nigeria with 40,000 deaths. Just 10 countries account for 60% of all maternal deaths. Expanding access to modern contraception for women across the developing world is another highly cost-effective measure that has proven results, and which could in itself reduce the numbers of maternal deaths by a third. In sub-Saharan Africa, just 22% of the women have access to modern contraception. In addition, there is a particular need for investment in health and education for the roughly 500 million adolescent girls who live in the developing world. Many of them never have a chance to fulfill their potential, because they marry too young and become pregnant too early. All too often, they lack access to adequate health care during pregnancy and at the time of birth. As a result, 70,000 teenage girls die in pregnancy or childbirth each year, making maternal death the most common cause of death for girls between 15 and 19 years old. Often, a high prevalence of maternal death reflects the low status of women in a society. With greater access to health and education, however, new generations of girls will be empowered to delay pregnancy, advance gender equality and contribute to the economic development of society. As educated mothers, they will be more likely to invest in the health and education of their children, thus empowering future generations as well. Empowered young people, women and others can beat the poverty trap, propel national development and ensure a more sustainable future for the world. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"(Mashable) -- We already knew about YouTube's redesign, which tech-savvy readers have been enabling for the past 10 days. As of now, however, the new YouTube is available to everyone. Unlike parent company Google, which tends to roll out redesigns over a period of days, YouTube pressed the button and switched the homepage for every user worldwide at 4:30 p.m. ET Thursday. So what's the change all about? One word: channels. The world's most popular online video service now sees itself as a descendent of cable TV, with millions of channels rather than hundreds -- and it's doing its darndest to encourage you to use it that way. The first new thing you'll see is an ""add channels"" button in the top left-hand corner of the page. Under that you'll find your top 10 favorite channels, which you can ""pin"" to the top of the page. ""The future of the YouTube experience has channels at the center of it,"" says Margaret Stewart, director of User Experience at YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, California. ""It's a container for all the world's video, and it needs to be the best home for that."" YouTube is also tweaking the colors of its logo and adding a soft gray background to the videos. In a sign that the service is becoming more integrated with its parent company -- and that more employees are going back and forth between San Bruno and the Googleplex in Mountain View -- Stewart says the redesign includes ""subtle alignments with Google's visual style."" Part of that process, naturally, includes integration with the Google+ social network. But YouTube is also making it easier to post videos on Facebook and Twitter, too. And the channel change also came to YouTube apps on platforms other than the web. For example, it just became a lot easier to access YouTube channels on your Xbox. There are four new channel templates that content creators can use, including one template designed for networks (with prominent featured content) and one for bloggers (with the most recent content first). Executives and designers at the company emphasize that this just the beginning of the redesign; more channel-focused changes and channel templates are coming soon.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A long-running conflict between the Pakistani government and the Supreme Court over old corruption cases against President Asif Ali Zardari appeared to move close to a resolution Wednesday as the two sides reached agreement on a crucial letter. But the accord left open the question of whether Zardari will ever have to stand trial over the cases. After three years of quarreling, the Supreme Court approved a draft of a letter from the Pakistani government to the Swiss authorities about the corruption cases, said Law and Justice Minister Farooq H. Naek after meeting with the judges. The cases relate to money-laundering charges from the 1990s against Zardari and his late wife, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. The prime minister at the time, Nawaz Sharif, asked Switzerland to open the cases against his political rivals. When Bhutto was prime minister, Zardari was accused so many times of corruption, stealing from government coffers and accepting kickbacks that Pakistanis derisively labeled him ""Mr. 10%."" Read more: First drone strike in Pakistan since protest march kills 5, officials say . A Swiss court convicted Zardari and Bhutto of some of the charges in absentia in 2003. But in 2007, President Pervez Musharraf granted amnesties to Zardari, Bhutto and hundreds of other politicians. Musharraf's attorney general, Malik Qayum, wrote a letter to Swiss authorities withdrawing Pakistani involvement in the cases against Zardari. Bhutto was assassinated in December 2007 during a campaign stop. The Pakistani Supreme Court declared the amnesties unconstitutional in 2009, saying Qayum's letter was ""unauthorized and illegal."" The court has been pressing the Pakistani government to send a fresh letter to the Swiss authorities asking them to discount Qayum's request and therefore leaving open the possibility of the cases against Zardari being revived. Earlier this year, the court convicted the prime minister at the time, Yousuf Raza Gilani, of contempt for refusing to send a letter to Switzerland and ousted him from office. Gilani is a member of Zardari's Pakistan Peoples Party. The government has now drafted the letter after the court began contempt proceedings against Gilani's successor, Raja Pervez Ashraf. ""This was the first time an honest attempt had been made to draft the letter,"" said Justice Asif Saeed Khosa, who headed the bench in the Supreme Court on Wednesday. He called the government's effort ""praiseworthy."" The Supreme Court said the Law and Justice Ministry had four weeks to translate and send the letter to the Swiss authorities. The court will reconvene on the matter on November 14. But whether the letter will prompt Swiss authorities to take any action remains unclear. ""Even if the letter is sent, it does not mean the corruption case against Zardari will necessarily be reinitiated,"" Babar Sattar a legal expert and lawyer said Wednesday. Naek, the justice minister, was adamant that that there was no threat to Zardari as a result of the letter. ""There is no question of a trial, even in that country,"" he said, referring to Switzerland. The judges' approval of the draft of the letter is ""the best decision for this country, nation and democracy,"" Naek said.","Supreme Court justices approve a draft of a letter to Swiss authorities .
The letter is related to old corruption cases against President Zardari .

"Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- Some 100 probable asylum seekers have died in the past few weeks off Australian shores. But there's no way of knowing exact numbers because the vessels on which these people perish don't carry passenger logs. Still, the boats keep sailing to Australia with desperate people believing that after a period of incarceration they'll begin new lives. Safe lives. And still, there appears to be no end in sight to the political stalemate between the ruling Labor government and its coalition opponents on how to stop the boats and the people smuggling trade that parlays human misery into cold hard cash. Detention facilities on Christmas Island, in the Indian Ocean, 2,600 km (1,615 miles) north west of Perth, are bursting beyond capacity as smugglers eye new destinations for their human cargo. 162 'asylum seekers' rescued by Australian Navy . Cocos Island, an Australian territory midway between the Australian mainland and Sri Lanka, has recently seen an upsurge on boat arrivals. This presents a new and more daunting prospect for the immigration and border authorities to deal with -- a significantly enlarged area of ocean that it must now keep under surveillance. Making the dilemma more acute, those who land on Cocos Island will be transported to Christmas Island for processing. So critical is the problem, the Australian government is now asking ordinary Australians to help out by housing asylum seekers who have received health and security clearances and have been issued a bridging visa. If they so choose, these asylum seekers are placed with a family to await final clearance and that all important visa which will allow them to establish themselves in Australia and begin a new life. Australian vote keeps question mark over asylum seekers . Host families receive a small stipend for their efforts. That, however, is not what has Australians opening their homes to people from such faraway countries and cultures. At least not Ben, a Sydney truck driver. He lives in the outer suburbs of the city with his family and has opened his home to Ali, a 21-year-old Afghan asylum seeker. ""These are people's lives and they are good people. I like to think people would do the same for me,"" he said. Which countries take in most refugees? Ali, who has been in Ben's care for the past six weeks while immigration authorities determine whether he will be granted permanent asylum, is anxious. His 46-year-old mother and two brothers are marooned in Pakistan, themselves waiting for Ali's case to be determined, hoping for asylum in Pakistan or Australia. But though Pakistan does its bit to take in asylum seekers, Ali tells me this is not a preferred option for his family. Too close to Afghanistan. Too close to the feared Taliban. Too precarious, lest Pakistan tires of them and sends them home. ""The Taliban have a long memory,"" he said. Ali's family hail, generations back, from Mongolia. And this he tells me was the source of the persecution his family faced in Afghanistan. ""We look a bit different,"" he said. Back home, in a small village in eastern Afghanistan, Ali was a tiler. His family owned several businesses -- a grocery store and a restaurant. They flourished in that small window of time during which the Taliban appeared to have been contained. As the Taliban slowly reasserted itself, Ali's family felt its racist wrath. In late 2010, Ali's father was shot and killed by forces the young son identified as Taliban. Not long after, the same men caught up with Ali. His passport and identification papers were confiscated as he was bundled into a jeep and driven away. Friends who were with Ali at the time, but were later freed, alerted Afghan national police who gave chase. In an ensuing gunfight, several of the Taliban fighters were shot dead. Ali, his jaw broken in two places, managed to escape the jeep and ran for his life. But the Taliban fighters caught up with him. He was shot in the leg and passed out. When Ali woke, he was in a Pakistani hospital, driven 10 hours across the border by Afghan police who had deemed this a safer place than an Afghan hospital where the Taliban might find him. ""Very big problem to stay in hospital in Afghanistan. There were Taliban,"" he said. Ali knew he could not return to his family in Afghanistan. He knew he would be hunted down and killed. His brothers too, knew that they had to escape. Quickly, they sold all the family possessions and what remained of their businesses in Afghanistan and with the money they reaped, they too fled across the border to Pakistan. Within weeks of his release from hospital, Ali had made contact with people smugglers -- ""mafia,"" as he called them. He needed to get as far away from Afghanistan as possible. The Pakistani people smugglers told him they could help -- for US$17,000. One month or so after paying the ""mafia,"" Ali was flying to Bangkok en route to Indonesia, via Malaysia. From a small town in Indonesia, Ali and a cohort of 14 other Afghans were shuttled onto a rickety bus, to make their way via Jakarta, to a southern port. He can't name the port. No-one told him where he was being taken. Within days of arriving in Indonesia, their journey to ""who knows where"" began. ""It was a big boat, very fast,"" recalled Ali. ""There were 185 people on the boat -- men, women and children. ""There was nowhere to sleep, nothing to eat. Can't go underneath the boat because of the bad smell ... so we stayed on top of the boat."" Uncomfortable and frightening as it no doubt was, this was one of the lucky journeys: there had been no sign the seas might engulf the travelers and inflict the cruelty it has on so many who have set out for Australia. A full day later, as the boatload of human cargo approached Christmas Island on calm seas, they finally discovered how far from Afghanistan they were. Intercepted by Australian authorities just before reaching Christmas Island, the bewildered and desperate travelers must nonetheless have breathed a sigh of relief. Ali was questioned, albeit periodically, over a period of 10 months as he languished in detention centers on Christmas Island, Tasmania and in the Northern Territory capital of Darwin. Still, he counts himself as lucky. Other asylum seekers have spent years in detention. But on June 12 this year, the Australian government granted Ali a health and security clearance along with a bridging visa and the right to work whilst he awaits final clearance. His was offered the choice of a homestay with an Australian family, or going it alone, perhaps with the support of the Afghan community. His mother and brothers are also waiting. Ali speaks with them regularly on Skype: his uncle, they told him, had recently been shot and killed by the Taliban. Pakistan might allow his family to remain there but that's not of much comfort to Ali. Would he ever see them again? ""I had a friend who got asylum here and went back to visit his family in Pakistan but he was killed,"" he said. ""And I am a wanted person."" If Australia allows him to stay, reuniting with his mother and brothers would be the final lucky break. And little of it thanks to Australia's politicians who continue their squabbling and point-scoring. *All names have been altered in this story at the request of the subjects.

"(CNN) -- Adventure-loving billionaire Richard Branson is known for reaching for the stars, but now he's set his sights on a final frontier a little closer to home: the deepest parts of the ocean floor. Branson announced his undersea exploration venture, Virgin Oceanic, earlier this month, and in a recent interview with CNN, he discussed the plans for his upcoming voyage to the bottom of the seabed. ""There have been about 400 people who have been into space but pretty well nobody has been down and explored the big trenches in the oceans,"" said the founder of the Virgin business empire. ""I am planning to go down in the Puerto Rican trench. It goes down further than Everest is high...about 28,000 feet."" The airplane-shaped Virgin Oceanic sub is built from carbon fiber and titanium, with a bubble-like quartz viewing dome made to withstand over 6 million kilograms of pressure. According to Virgin Oceanic, the ""flying"" sub has overcome two big obstacles facing deep-sea explorers: extreme cold and pressures of over 1,000 atmospheres (about the same as 8,000 elephants standing on a Mini Cooper). Picking up where Steve Fossett -- Branson's close friend and fellow adventurer who perished in a flying accident in 2007 -- left off, the sub's sophisticated design will allow it to travel to depths of 36,000 feet -- about double that of previous advanced subs, according to Branson. ""We hope we built it right,"" he said. ""The Americans, Germans and the Chinese have tried before but they have never been able to get below 18,000 feet -- so it's been quite a technological feat."" However, the British entrepreneur is all too aware of potential perils. According to him, two things could go wrong. ""One, obviously, is the catastrophic failure of the sub,"" he admitted. ""Hopefully we'll hear pinging sounds as the carbon fiber starts to break and at that stage you just don't go any further."" The other possibility, Branson warned, is that of getting caught up in fishing nets at the bottom and not being able to resurface. However, the 60-year-old father of two remains philosophical: ""There are risks involved in trying to push the boundaries forward. There were risks involved when man first went into space and we will do everything we can to avoid any catastrophic problems."" Although the sub is expected to smash up to 30 diving records, Branson insists that the exploration is about much more than sheer adventure. ""There's thousands of species that man doesn't know exists and we are going to come up with some extraordinary photographs of the most extraordinary creatures that mankind has never seen,"" he said. Indeed, the mission behind the Virgin Oceanic expedition includes a brief to ""assist science in understanding our eco-system and raise awareness of the challenges facing our oceans."" Unlike his suborbital-space-flight company, Virgin Galactic, the new expedition is not accepting paying passengers. Rather, it will comprise only five deep-sea dives, each one carrying just one person, to the deepest points in each of the five oceans. So, is Branson nervous to be one of the solo voyagers? ""I am sure there will be a few flutters in the stomach as one goes down -- it's going to take about three hours to reach the bottom of the sea,"" he said. But he's no stranger to danger. Having launched Virgin Records in the 1970s and amassing a fortune in various holdings, which include an airline and rail group, Branson has used his money to fund such exploits as circumnavigating the globe in a hot air balloon as well as various sailing records. And what does his wife think about this latest venture? ""She'd much rather I was doing it than my kids,"" he quipped, adding that as long as he signed a piece of paper leaving her Necker Island -- his private island hideaway in the Caribbean -- ""she'd be fine.""","Virgin Oceanic sub will be capable of traveling twice as deep as anything before .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The investigation into the massive Station fire north of Los Angeles is underway with authorities working to determine how the raging fire started, fire officials in California said Wednesday. A massive wildfire burns Tuesday near a house in La Crescenta, California, near Los Angeles. Despite reports that U.S. Forest Service spokesman Carlton Joseph said the fire burning in the Angeles National Forest was ""human-caused"" -- either accidentally or intentionally -- other officials insisted that the cause of the fire is under investigation, and natural sources have not been ruled out. ""That information is not validated -- that's why we're investigating,"" Angeles National Forest supervisor Jody Noiren told reporters Wednesday, referring to the human-caused report. Thousands of anxious Southern California residents have been displaced by the Station fire burned 140,150 acres by Wednesday. However, Fire Chief Mike Dietrich with the U.S. Forest Service characterized Wednesday as a ""good day,"" noting the fire is 28 percent contained -- up from 22 percent the day before. ""We're fighting for every foot of containment we can get on this fire,"" Dietrich said. Watch as firefighters are forced on the defensive » . He said firefighters have made progress controlling the northern and western parameters of the fire, but the top priority is to keep the southeastern corner of the fire away from areas along Interstate 210, including Pasadena, Aracadia and Sierra Madre. The blaze is headed toward the San Gabriel Wilderness Area of the Angeles forest. The San Gabriel represents the eastern edge of the fire, he said. Nearly all of the fire was in forest land and the nearby foothill communities, including La Canada-Flintridge, La Crescenta and Acton. ""This is a very complicated situation, and it continues to be complicated as it moves east,"" Dietrich said. Residents have fled from 10,000 homes along the edges of the Angeles Forest since the fire started last Wednesday. However, the majority of evacuees were allowed back in their homes by Wednesday. Noiren said two dozen Forest Service workers also were displaced by the fire, and the agency lost an entire fire station to the blaze.  See images of the wildfire » . Beth Halaas sifted through the ashes of her family's charred home in Los Angeles County, trying to find something to salvage. ""It's stuff. Hold on to some of it for traditions.

Noel and Marta Rincon had to evacuate their home in Tujunga, on the western side of the fire. Fire was actively burning in the Little Tujunga canyon area, according to fire officials. ""I thought that we were losing our home,"" the husband said of the residence where he was born and the couple raised their family. When a Sky Crane helicopter doused the flames before they could reach the structure, the two were visibly relieved. ""It's very scary,"" the wife said, ""but our captain over here keeps assuring us our house is very savable and that we are going to be fine.""  See how these wildfires grow » . The fire has destroyed 64 homes, three commercial properties and 49 outdoor structures since it began on August 26, authorities said. The state has spent about $27 million so far fighting the fire in the Angeles National Forest, Dietrich said. Earlier, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger was asked about the cost of the firefighting, given the state's precarious financial position.  Watch as governor urges residents to heed evacuation orders » . ""I've made it clear that even though we have a budget crunch and we have an economic crisis and we just solved a $23 billion deficit, we will always have the money available to fight the fires because public safety is our No. 1 priority,"" Schwarzenegger responded.

The governor said he insisted that the state budget he signed in July have a $500 million reserve for emergencies such as fires. California has had 5,000 blazes so far this year, he said. He said 21 firefighters have been injured battling the Station Fire, in addition to the two killed Sunday in a vehicular crash trying to escape fast-moving flames. Wednesday's valley and desert temperatures could reach 103 degrees, the National Weather Service said, while mountain highs were forecast to be 100. While potentially beneficial higher humidity was expected, thunderstorms were possible, and they could bring the danger of dry lightning that could ignite more fires, forecasters said. They also pose the danger of downdrafts that could create more fire fronts, officials said. Cooler temperatures are predicted for the weekend. Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency Friday as a result of the Station fire. He also proclaimed a state of emergency in several other counties where fires were burning.

"(CNN) -- Authorities say they have made an arrest in the case of a Georgia college student missing since last month. Police at Middle Georgia State College arrested and charged Robert Kane Rolison, 17, with one count of murder in the disappearance and death of Jmaal Malik Keyes, who was last seen on April 25 and reported missing on April 29. Rolison was arrested at his home Thursday night. Both were students at the school in Cochran, Georgia. Campus Police Chief Shawn Douglas said Friday that authorities were searching for the body of Keyes, a 19-year-old freshman from Atlanta. Rolison is from Hawkinsville, Georgia, and police describe him as a dual-enrolled high school/Middle Georgia State student. The suspect is now in custody at a Bleckley County, Georgia, facility. Rolison and Keyes knew each other, and Rolison gave Keyes a ride to a convenience store the day Keyes went missing, Douglas said. The chief is not commenting on a motive and said he doesn't know of any prior conflict between Rolison and Keyes. ""We are absolutely devastated by this news,"" said John Black, the college's interim president. ""There just are no words to describe how deeply hurt we are and how terrible we feel for Jmaal's family.

"(CNN) -- With just a few clicks of a mouse, kids as young as 12 can have free condoms delivered to their doors in California. News of the program's expansion to two new counties comes as the federal government approves the ""morning-after pill"" without a prescription for girls as young as 15. The development has garnered mixed reactions. ""I would ask parents the question, 'Who should be making decisions for the best welfare of your child -- you as a parent, or the state, who has no direct connection, has no understanding, has no relationship with your child?'"" San Diego-area pastor Chris Clark told CNN affiliate KSWB. ""If I was 12 and hearing this 'news' and looking at my Lego blocks, I would feel like such a loser. 'Is everyone doing it but me?' Talk about pressure!"" CNN commenter Song Sing Sing posted. Commenter bare_necessities ""couldn't disagree more."" Having received free condoms during a fifth-grade health class, bare_necessities says classmates usually used them to make balloons. ""Most, if not all, of us hadn't even become interested in the other sex at that age, but I'd like to think that the experience prepared us better for when we did. Condoms don't make children more sexually active."" The alarming rates of sexually transmitted diseases among teens call for immediate action, health officials say. The Condom Access Project has been around for a year. Late last month, it expanded to San Diego and Fresno counties, bringing the number of counties it serves to seven. As part of the project, anyone between 12 and 19 years old in those counties can confidentially request a pack of 10 condoms online, up to once a month. It's similar to Planned Parenthood programs that offer free condoms to teens who come to the organization's health centers. With each order, teens also receive personal lubricant to reduce breakage as well as educational information, said the California Family Health Council, which runs the Condom Access Project. So far, the program has sent nearly 30,000 condoms to youths via home mailers in the past year. ""Despite broad retail availability, teens continue to face many barriers to accessing condoms,"" such as embarrassment, cost and confidentiality, the council said. The mail-order program targets counties that the council has designated as ""STD hot-spots."" ""California is experiencing a near public health crisis with STD rates among teens rising to alarming levels,"" said Julie Rabinovitz, the council's president. ""By providing sexually active teens and their parents with the tools they need to prevent STDs and unintended pregnancy, we are hoping to move the needle in the right direction."" While teen pregnancy rates in the state have declined steadily over the past decade, rates of sexually transmitted diseases among California teens ages 15 to 19 are rising, the council said. In 2011, more than 42,000 cases of chlamydia and 4,800 cases of gonorrhea were reported in that age group, according to the California Department of Public Health. Out of California's 58 counties, San Diego and Fresno counties are among the highest for both chlamydia and gonorrhea cases. The program runs on a $5,000 annual budget supported by federal tax dollars, CNN affiliate KSWB reported. The health council says it operates the country's largest Title X system in the country, providing sexual and reproductive health care for more than 1 million Californians a year. It also receives support from grants and individual and corporate donations, the group said. The federal Title X Family Planning program, enacted in 1970, provides contraceptive services and preventative health care. By law, priority is given to people from low-income families, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. FDA OKs morning-after pill for ages 15 and up .

We spunked up the wording a bit to keep you healthily entertained. Please excuse the myriad ""Call Me Maybe"" references to come. We hate ourselves, too. So my friend recently posted about something really big in the news -- OK, how much he likes Carly Rae Jepsen's ""Call Me Maybe,"" but, hey, that's big in MY world -- on Facebook. I saw this right before I was about to post something akin to, ""Carly Rae Jepsen is obviously one of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse. It's only a matter of time until the Earth heaves its last metaphorical breath."" How can I create a post stating the exact opposite opinion to my friend's without sounding like a total tool who is passive aggressively jabbing at him ""publicly""? And how can I do this WITHOUT having to be overly disclaimer-ish, state caveats, water down my thoughts, etc.? Although we often warn y'all not to post tool-y stuff on your Facebook Timeline, what it comes down to is this: Your Timeline is your canvas on which you can post anything you please, and no one can stop you from opening the proverbial floodgates (unless, of course, you're violating Facebook's Community Standards in some way.) If you are merely -- by happenstance -- sharing your disdain for the artist behind what is frighteningly deemed ""the song of the summer"" (can you tell that we share your derision?) at the same instance that your pal is drooling all over it, by all means, go ahead and let loose. Only an overly sensitive (and paranoid) person would take a post on your Timeline about a (Canadian!) pop star as a direct affront to his taste. However, if you are seeking to directly counter his point of view via your epistle, maybe include your friend in the post via tag -- in a constructive way. For example: ""I am so not digging this jam. Why the eff is she throwing a wish in a well? @Kyle Franklin, what about the song gets you going so?"" If your friend is cool, you might just inspire a pretty interesting dialogue. Still, a recent study showed that those who use Facebook as an outlet to get out all their gripes are basically the bane of their ""friends' "" existence, so maybe you better save the rants about the Bieb's protÃ©gÃ© for next time you consume an entire bottle of wine at your buddy's birthday party -- you know, before the tears start. Out of politeness, I've accepted Facebook friend requests from any family members who have sent them. I didn't have the foresight to limit their ability to post on my wall, and now several of them -- namely an overzealous uncle and aunt -- have taken it over. What's the least controversial way to get them to stop? There are a lot of fiddly ways to limit who can see what on your Wall and who can respond and blah, blah, blah. Therefore, we can understand why you didn't safeguard your digital digs from your extended family. Luckily for you, there's a quick fix: Each time you go to post a kitten video or an inspirational quote or lyric from ""Call Me Maybe"" (You're totally the friend in the first letter. Admit it.) on your Timeline, click on ""Friends,"" right next to ""Post."" Scroll down to ""Custom,"" and from there you can block specific people from seeing your Timeline post, and consequently littering it with inane comments. That should quell the tide of familial overfamiliarity for a while. In the meantime, maybe plan a visit or pick up the phone or something. It seems like your aunt and uncle miss you. Or are shut-ins. Either/or. Recently, a friend whom I see quite often sent me a Facebook message reading: ""I think we're growing apart."" I'm kind of appalled, considering we see each other every few weeks and e-mail and whatever a lot during the day -- also, Facebook message? Are we 14 here? Maybe he's pissed because I finally have a girlfriend? Who knows. Anyway, how do I answer this? Via Facebook message? E-mail? Phone? Carrier pigeon? Wow, your friend is lame. Or just really, really cowardly. If -- with the knowledge that your friend is lame and cowardly -- you still want to keep the friendship alive and high-steppin', might we suggest, and this is crazy, pulling up his number and calling him maybe?","Your Facebook Timeline is your canvas, our Netiquette columnists say .

"(CNN) -- For some reason, moviemakers haven't been falling over themselves to glorify the exciting and heroic lives of bike messengers -- which at least leaves director David Koepp with a clear field. And if it's a two-wheeled, pedal-powered adrenaline charge you're after, this is definitely the movie to watch. Yes, the plot is contrived and stretched much too thin. Yes, the characters are strictly off the peg. And yes, this flick is essentially a one-trick pony. But at least it's something different. ""Premium Rush"" is loaded with on-road action, scarcely pausing for breath as courier Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) criss-crosses Manhattan on his austere steel-frame, fixed-gear, no-brakes bone-rattler. Wilee takes his handle from the Coyote, but he's got more in common with Road Runner, zipping through the city's canyons, slaloming around cabs and pedestrians, oblivious to red lights and traffic regulations. Gordon-Levitt's an attractive and engaging actor, but motorists may find it challenging to overlook this guy's reckless and self-centered road sense, which is dressed up here as your typical Zen-existential-death-wish trip. The Coyote role -- one Robert Monday -- falls to Hollywood's current go-to crazy, Michael Shannon (""Take Shelter,"" ""Boardwalk Empire""), who sucks up all the juiciest dialogue as a guy with impulse control issues. He's after an envelope that Wilee is delivering downtown -- it really doesn't matter why -- and he's not going to take no for an answer. Frankly, I'd have liked to have spent more time with this unhinged brother to the ""Bad Lieutenant."" I mean, who didn't wish the Coyote got his bird just once? Koepp, who also wrote the screenplay with John Kamps, ramps up the velocity with low camera angles, speeded-up photography and a rag-bag of digital add-ons. Wilee plots intersections with a kind of mental Streetview, calculating potential wipeouts and collisions like Sherlock Holmes armed with a GPS. This souped-up visual gimmickry is eye-catching but as empty and artificial as Koepp's story, which skates over several glaring coincidences and absurdities on what must be the unluckiest day in Wilee's life. It doesn't have to be ""Bicycle Thieves,"" but a more nuts and bolts approach to physical reality wouldn't have hurt: fewer impossible jumps, more hard landings. I can readily believe that a cyclist could stay a step ahead of a car on Manhattan's crowded streets -- just as well, as the movie is essentially a series of long chase scenes stuck end to end - but a modicum of consistency would be nice. One minute, Wilee is racing hell for leather to evade a bike cop; the next, he's parking outside a police station to report the bug-eyed motorist trying to turn him into roadkill. Probably to satisfy the moneymen, and maybe to spin out his slim 75-minute story to an hour and a half, Koepp also throws in a romantic subplot. It's an unnecessary distraction from the business at hand. Koepp shifts backward and forward in time when it suits him, but altogether too much of the romantic sparring takes place on the hands-free as Wilee and Vanessa (Dania Ramirez) hurtle in different directions. Trust me: That heavy breathing you hear has nothing to do with sex. An unpretentious throwback to the kind of action movie that had no need of superheroes, ""Premium Rush"" is hardly a classic but fun up to a point, and it's a B movie for gearheads with no bells and whistles.","""Premium Rush"" is centered around a group of New York bike messengers .

"(LifeWire) -- When April Kling locked eyes with a handsome stranger on her flight out of Chicago last Christmas, her heart skipped a beat. So she did what any hip 21st-century single would do: She posted an ad on Craigslist.org's ""missed connections"" bulletin board when she got home. A ""missed connection"" ad led to the marriage of Dan and Erin Kottke who welcomed son Linus two years later. ""He replied within two hours,"" says Kling, a 29-year-old sales associate and musician from Seattle. ""We e-mailed back and forth and realized we had a lot of mutual friends. I thought, 'Wow, this is meant to be.'"" It wasn't. Kling and her missed-connection match went out a few times, but then he bowed out, citing relationship butterflies. Three weeks later, however, a mutual friend told Kling the guy was seeing someone else. But he apparently was still smitten with the story of how he and Kling met. ""I was at a wedding and this girl came up to me and says, 'Are you that April who dated so-and-so last winter? I just love your story -- it's so romantic,'"" says Kling. ""For me, that's the kind of story you tell if you're still together."" Yearning to be 'missed' Craigslist, Kizmeet.com, ISawYou.com, SubwayCrush.com -- these missed-opportunity matchmakers have become a staple of online modern love. They've also become a way for some singles to fantasize about the people they'd like to meet and those they hope will want to meet them. ""I love reading those missed-connections ads. Everyone does,"" says Adrienne Meraz, a 22-year-old gallery assistant from New York City. ""And I've always had this hope in the back of my mind that someone would 'miss' me."" Meraz's wish came true in February after a chance encounter with a handsome graphic designer named Jeff at the grocery store, when they both reached for the same carton of orange juice. At home a few hours later, Meraz, an avid reader of Craigslist's missed connections, surfed over to the site and got the surprise of her life: ""Beautiful girl in the sambas at Trader Joe's - m4w - 23 (Union Square)."" ""When I saw Jeff's ad, I started screaming, 'I'm the brunette in the (Adidas) Sambas!'"" Meraz says. The two have been dating ever since. Desperately seeking someone . Mary Robertson, a documentary filmmaker in New York City, isn't surprised by the appeal of the missed connection. She's been working on a film about the phenomenon for 10 months. ""What inspires me about these ads is the density of the narrative,"" says Robertson, 30, who's read and responded to hundreds of Craigslist postings since beginning work on the film. ""The longing, the romance -- all in this small space. They're like haikus."" Some of the stories Robertson has collected are heart-wrenching -- like the Milwaukee man who spent five hours talking with a woman in a New York bar, realized she was the ""love of his life,"" then left without getting her number. Others, like the woman whose online flirt turned out to be married, are cynical reminders of how elusive true connections can be. Most ads come from commuters afraid to talk to someone on the subway out of shyness, says Robertson. Other chance encounters occur at big-box stores like Target. ""There's one elevator in the Target on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn that seems to be a real hot spot for romance,"" she says. ""If I were single, I'd ride that elevator up and down."" Redefining the pickup line . The appeal of missed-connection Web sites may indicate a shift in how people approach the search for love. One woman Robertson interviewed told her of a flirtatious encounter with a guy at a pizza parlor. Rather than give the guy her number, Robertson says, ""she said to herself, 'I'll just find him later on the Internet.' Five years or even two years ago, you wouldn't have thought you could find a stranger on the Internet. But that possibility exists now."" That's not necessarily a good thing, says Bonnie Jacobson, director of the New York Institute for Psychological Change and author of ""The Shy Single: A Bold Guide to Dating for the Less-Than-Bold Dater."" ""We have so much technology, all these ways of communicating that aren't face to face, it's intensified our fear of direct communication,"" she says. ""It's always scary to say hello to a stranger, but going to the Internet just keeps the hesitation going."" Happily ever after? But missed connections aren't just about being too shy to approach a potential love interest or reaching for the unattainable out of fear of commitment. Sometimes, they're simply about losing the object of your attraction in a crowd. Dan Kottke, a 31-year-old architect from Minneapolis, says he was disappointed when he couldn't find Erin, the ""cool girl with the magnetic personality"" he'd chatted with at a concert on September 4, 2006. But he was delighted when he saw her Craigslist posting the next day. ""A lot of those ads seem to be from guys and girls who can't work up the courage to ask the person out,"" he says. ""But in the case with Erin, it was a true missed connection."" Kottke and Erin, a 26-year-old marketing manager, went on a date three weeks after she posted the ad. Their story has a true -- and traditional -- happy ending. ""It's really unbelievable to think how one little item like an Internet posting has changed my life,"" says Kottke. ""But a couple of years later, I'm happily married and have a great son. I really do owe a lot to Craigslist."" LifeWire provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to Web publishers.

"(CNN) -- Police arrested four people Monday in connection with a nightclub fire that killed 231 people in southern Brazil, CNN affiliate BandNews reported. Two are club owners and the other two members of the band that was performing, it said. The detainees will be held initially for five days while authorities investigate Sunday's blaze in the Kiss nightclub in Santa Maria, according to Marcos Viana, a police official who spoke with state-run Agencia Brasil. The five-day period can be extended for five more days, the news agency said. ""We concluded that it was necessary to hold them prisoner temporarily, because we need their statements to help us clarify the incident,"" Viana said, according to Agencia Brasil. Brazil nightclub fire: 'Like a war zone' with bodies piled . Police did not identify those arrested. ""We have much work ahead to clarify what happened and identify those responsible,"" Viana said, according to the news agency. Civil police in Santa Maria have questioned 20 other people, it said. The police chief in the province of Rio Grande do Sul said the investigation is to be divided into three parts: ""The first line of inquiry has to do with the documentation: if the property was fit for operation and who the owners are. Are they real, formal owners? We will review all the documentation. ""The second stage of this investigation is expert analysis, which we will apply. ""And thirdly, important in itself, is the witness testimony. So, starting today, we will focus our efforts to the maximum in order to hear those people who were at the property at the time that it caught fire, at the business establishment. I think we'll get to the bottom of this investigation and, if possible, will identify those responsible by the time we complete this police investigation."" The governor of Rio Grande do Sul promised that investigators would have all the resources they need to find out who is responsible. ""From the executive office, they will not lack a penny, a document, an action or any other support, so that we can have an inquiry with depth and with the responsibility that it deserves,"" Gov. Tarso Genro said. Photos: Hundreds dead in Brazil nightclub fire . More than 100 clubgoers were injured in the fire, which authorities say began about 2:30 a.m. Sunday during a band's pyrotechnic show. Guitarist Rodrigo Lemos Martins of the Gurizada Fandangueira band told the newspaper Folha de SÃ£o Paulo that the fire ignited one song after the band had used fireworks in the show. But he said it was not clear what may have caused the fire. ""There were many wires on the ceiling, and there could have been a short circuit,"" he said. Many apparently died from smoke inhalation; others were trampled in the rush for the exits. Mayara Peirera, a 21-year-old law student who was celebrating her birthday at the club, told CNN she escaped with a friend through a nearby door. When she turned to look back, ""I saw people bleeding, fainting, running over other people. People desperate, screaming. And it was then I realized what was going on,"" Peirera said. But two friends -- ""almost sisters to me"" -- didn't make it out, she said. ""I thank God because in one way or another, I got a birthday gift -- my life,"" she said. ""I was born again, but I'm very sad and hurt because I lost my best friends. I can no longer cry, because I have already cried so much."" And Michele Pereira told Folha de SÃ£o Paulo that her friend, 23-year-old Leandra Toniolo, was in the bathroom when the fire began. How to protect yourself in a crowd . ""I was on the opposite side, near the stage,"" Pereira said. ""I would have had to go all the way across the arena -- against the mayhem -- to find her, and in the tumult, it was impossible,"" she said. ""It was terrible, a scene from a horror film. ... There were fallen bodies throughout on the ground, many people who had fainted, many crying and trying to breathe with all that smoke."" By the time Toniolo's mother found her daughter's body, it had been placed with others in a truck, Pereira said. The nightclub owners have pledged to cooperate with the investigation, according to a statement released by the law firm of Kummel & Kummel. ""We are open to all authorities and inspections,"" said the statement, obtained by Globo TV. The club's license had expired in August and had not been renewed, a local fire official told Globo TV. The owners, however, said the nightclub was properly permitted and had been inspected by the fire marshal. Opinion: We haven't learned from past mistakes . The city's mayor, Cezar Schirmer, said the fire department ""has always done a very strict surveillance on the homes of shows and dealt with all other issues that relate to security of these places."" On Monday, the first of Brazil's three days of mourning, flowers were left outside the club in tribute to the victims, and a flag outside the country's presidential palace flew at half-staff. In Santa Maria, mourners lined up in a series of funeral processions, and coffins were lined up in a gymnasium that authorities had turned into a morgue. By noon, 40 of 110 funerals planned for the day had been held at the city's municipal cemetery, its chief of staff told Band News. At one funeral, air force troops fired rifles in tribute to a comrade who died in Sunday's fire. At another, two teenage brothers, the only children in one family, were buried side by side. Of the people who were hurt, 82 were still in area hospitals; 40 were taken four hours east to the city Porto Alegre, BandNews TV reported.

"(CNN) -- A polar bear twin born last month at a German zoo has died less than a week after its sibling, zoo officials announced Saturday. One year ago Vera gave birth to Flocke, pictured here playing in April. The young bear died Friday at the Nuremberg Zoo, three weeks after the twins were born to the zoo's 6-year-old bear, Vera. The first twin died Monday, the zoo said. Zookeepers watching the bears' cave on a closed-circuit video feed had noticed in the morning that the baby bear looked weaker, the zoo said. Around 2 p.m. (10 a.m. ET), Vera suddenly became excited, darted out of the cave and back in again, and started rebuilding her straw nest. At that point, zookeepers saw that the young bear was making no more noises and was dead. Zoo Director Dag Encke said he regretted the deaths. ""Vera nursed regularly and the young animal always slept well afterwards, so it seemed certain that it received enough milk,"" he said. ""The reason that the young animal wasted away so quickly is not known."" It was a year ago this week that Vera gave birth to Flocke, whose cute antics and fluffy fur made him an instant celebrity across Germany.","Baby polar bear dies less than a week after its twin in German zoo .

"(CNN) -- Hollywood excess is always an easy target, as the reception to last week's ""John Carter"" shows. But it's worth remembering, simplicity is hard. The simplicity fused with moral force and emotional gravity that brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne bring to Cannes Grand Prix winner, ""The Kid with a Bike,"" is a rare and beautiful thing. The Belgian siblings have forged an impressive foothold in the international cinema scene over the past 15 years or so, with a brand of rigorous, concerted neo-realist tales like ""Rosetta,"" ""The Child"" and ""The Son"" (""Le fils"") that focus on marginalized, working class characters trapped by poverty and circumstance, but occasionally within spitting distance of something that can only be described as grace. As those titles suggest, children and parental bonds are a recurring theme, and they are paramount again in ""The Kid with a Bike."" Twelve-year-old Cyril (Thomas Doret) is a blonde urchin with a face that looks like it has already had too many tears squeezed out of it. When we first see him, he's planning his escape from a children's home. He's desperate to get back home with his father, and refuses to believe it when they tell him the ne'er do well has taken off with no forwarding address. Alas, when he does get away, the care-workers' story checks out: Their apartment is empty, even Cyril's most prized possession, the bike his dad gave him, has gone. It's at this moment, when the boy is trying to avoid recapture and deny the extent of his abandonment, that he runs headlong into the arms of a stranger, Samantha (Cecile de France). He clings on so tight that something clicks inside her, and she decides she cannot let him go. Over the following months, Samantha brings Cyril his beloved bike and persuades the authorities to allow the boy to visit with her on weekends. She'll track down his father (Jeremie Regnier), and insist they meet. (The spineless wretch won't even admit to the boy that his dad never wants to see him again.) She'll even furnish a home for Cyril, even though he's scarcely capable of acknowledging his gratitude. Still, the most severe tests of her love and compassion lie ahead. Cecile de France is careful not to play a saint. In some ways Samantha may be at the mercy of her resolution, it's certainly a hard road she chooses. But then, how do you put a price on a sunny summer bike ride with a child who loves you like a mother? Speaking as a parent, ""The Kid with a Bike"" is sometimes almost unbearable to watch. Not for the common cruelty of Cyril's neglect so much as the Dardennes' keen perception of his vulnerability to evil. The boy craves respect. He's easy prey for an older teen, a youth who grants him privileges that no parent can compete with, and demands loyalty and self-sacrifice in return. It's a straightforward moral schema, but a perennial story of innocence and corruption that resonates intimately with the world at large. And in this telling, it's as compelling as any thriller. There is not a wasted shot in this stripped down, pared back fable. Yet, it accrues a deep and lasting power.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Quick question: Who is the world's third biggest smartphone maker? BlackBerry? Guess again. HTC? Nope. It's Huawei. Yes, it's a paltry 5% of the global market, but the Chinese company that made its name selling telecom equipment is making a big push into the already crowded global smartphone market. I saw that ambition first hand at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona earlier this year. Huawei ads were posted all over the airport to greet the throngs of international conference-goers. The company also occupied a huge booth at the venue positioned just across from Samsung. But just how big does Huawei -- the smartphone maker -- want to get? At company headquarters in Shenzhen in southern China, I talked to Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei's Consumer Business Group. He told me his division hopes to boost its mobile business revenue from $7.5 billion to $9 billion this year. ""Last year, we shipped out 32 million smartphones in quantity and this year we hope we will ship out 50 to 60 million smartphones worldwide,"" he said. ""We are growing."" The market priority for Huawei's Consumer Business Group is China, followed by Europe and Japan. But -- when it comes to smartphones -- it's not ruling out the U.S. market despite the recent back and forth about Huawei's commitment there. In the U.S., the name Huawei is widely regarded with suspicion. Lawmakers are worried that Huawei products can be used as a hidden channel for Chinese spies and cyber hackers -- a charge that Huawei has denied. Despite the trust issues and the fact that many Americans can't even pronounce the name of the company, Huawei has sold and will continue to sell its phones in America under the Huawei brand. ""Gradually, step by step, more and more people will trust Huawei,"" said Yu. ""I think with a brand, the most important thing is trust."" Huawei prides itself on its investment in research and development -- 70,000 of its 150,000 employees are in R&D -- as well as its high-end products like the $500 Ascend P2, which is billed as the ""world's fastest 4G LTE smartphone."" Yu told me his personal favorite is the Ascend D2, Huawei's $600 flagship smartphone that is water-resistant -- a point famously made by Yu when he posted a photo of himself swimming with the smartphone on his Sina Weibo account. But Huawei is more widely known for its $100 (Y-300) smartphone -- a cut-price device that Josh Ong of The Next Web says is the company's competitive advantage and branding bane. ""Huawei is going to be able to execute on smartphones at lower costs than some of its international competitors,"" he said. ""It doesn't have the cachet or consumer loyalty that Apple and Samsung do."" My colleague Dayu Zhang in Beijing offered this on-the-ground Chinese consumer perspective: ""To me and my friends, Huawei is more like a brand of low-end, cheap smartphones. ""(Such) Chinese brands are popular among the 'ant tribe community,' which refers to young people who come to the city for a better job but got stuck with low-paid jobs and high costs to live in the city. In their eyes, these Chinese smartphones are a lot cheaper than big brands like the iPhone and almost as good."" Huawei has a reputation for making smartphones that are just good enough. But that's not good enough for Huawei. To upgrade its image, the company says it will bypass expensive branding campaigns and splashy ads to focus on innovation to generate viral, word-of-mouth recommendations. And that will take time. ""Rome was not built in a day,"" said Yu. ""We have the ambition to be the best -- to have the best products and be the best solution provider."" Would you buy a Huawei smartphone? Perhaps, if that's what you're after. They're ""good enough."" Would you want to buy one? Not yet. And that's the question Huawei has its designs on.","China's Huawei is now the world's third biggest smartphone maker .
The Shenzhen-based manufacturer has designs on markets outside China .
U.S, lawmakers worry Huawei products could be hidden channel spies, hackers .
The company produces smartphones priced much lower than rivals such as Apple ."
"(CNN) -- About 1,500 texts, voice mails and e-mails, some from people he hasn't spoken to in 20 years, have deluged Andy Enfield's in-boxes over the past few days. ""Ninety-nine percent of it is all excited and congratulatory. But there are some people that e-mail me just out of the blue, or somehow get my cell phone number, and text me and say derogatory things. And that just comes with the Internet age,"" the youthful-looking 43-year-old Florida Gulf Coast University head basketball coach said Tuesday. ""I believe that this doesn't happen to every coach, because every coach is not a 15 seed,"" Enfield told CNN's Rachel Nichols on ""The Lead with Jake Tapper."" Florida Gulf Coast is the lowest-seeded team to ever advance to the Sweet 16 round of the NCAA college basketball championship tournament. That accomplishment has focused the spotlight on the previously-little-known coach of a previously-little-known university. And it's also focused TV cameras on his telegenic wife, the mother of his three children, who boasts a higher-profile past -- as a model who appeared on the cover of magazines such as Maxim. ""We don't talk about it. Amanda doesn't walk up to people and just say, 'Hey, look at my pictures on the Internet,'"" Enfield said. ""So, this media scrutiny and attention, I think we're all flattered by it, but it's just not who we are. We're so laid back about our past and what we've done. Really, we just want our focus to be on our team, on what FGCU has done, and this great institution."" Florida Gulf Coast stuns Georgetown in shocking upset . Before last weekend's upsets of regional No. 2 seed Georgetown and No. 7 seed San Diego State, most people -- even players Enfield was recruiting -- had no idea know where Florida Gulf Coast University is. ""They'd think we were the Gulf Coast Community College in the (Florida) Panhandle,"" he said recently as his basketball team prepared for its first NCAA tournament game. ""I would to keep saying, 'No, we are a Division I school. We are in Fort Myers.' ""It just wouldn't register because they had never heard of us."" It's been a quick rise to prominence for a school that didn't even exist 16 years ago and only started its sports program in 2002. The hoops team, which joined Division I just five years ago and became eligible for tournament play two years ago, was coming off a 10-20 season when Enfield was hired away from his assistant position at Florida State. It was a tough start. Three team leaders transferred. He had to recruit players while his wife was in the hospital having their third child. (Well, he didn't HAVE to, but he did) The coach recalls telling his staff that they had two goals: Quickly recruit talent and make the players that were recruited better. ""The chemistry on the team in unbelievable. It's the best I've been around in my years of coaching. I think people see that on the court. We look for the individual personality side when we recruit, and also the talent. Then, we try to develop our players on and off the court,"" Enfield told Nichols. ""I think what you're seeing is our style of basketball these last two games ... we've been successful because our players enjoy their friends and they enjoy playing with each other."" Enfield is used to success. He was valedictorian in high school in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. As a college guard at Johns Hopkins University, he set the NCAA Division III record in 1991 for career free throw percentage at 92.5%. He parlayed his reputation as a great shooter into a job as a consultant to NBA teams where he helped players improve their form. Two of those gigs turned into full-time positions as an assistant coach, one with the Boston Celtics. While Enfield taught good shooting technique, he also learned about coaching from Rick Pitino, who is now the head coach of No. 1 seed Louisville. ""Basketball's always been in my blood. My father was a high school coach. He coached ninth grade for 20-something years. It's always been with me. It's my passion,"" Enfield said. He majored in economics at Johns Hopkins and received an MBA from Maryland, then left coaching in 2000 to co-found Chattanooga, Tennessee-based TractManager, a contract management company in the health care industry. Sports Illustrated reported that the privately held company is worth at least $100 million. ""I retain a part of company, but I'm not involved any way in management,'' Enfield told the magazine this week. His partner, Tom Rizk, said he asked Enfield to be one of the initial investors because he saw some genius in him. ""One of his very significant talents was to be a leader,"" Rizk told the News-Press of Fort Myers. ""People were following him. He is a special guy. He's smart. He's articulate. He's very positive. If there's a guy that could turn a program around like yours, it's him."" March Madness A to Z . While he was working in New York for the company, he was set to drive to Boston to watch the NCAA tournament. A friend said her girlfriend had tickets, too. They were going to fly, but Enfield offered them a ride so they could save the $500. The girlfriend was Amanda Marcum, a model who had appeared on the covers of magazines such Maxim and Vogue and did runway work in Europe. ""I didn't know her at the time,"" Enfield said, ""but I knew as soon as she got in the car, I knew it would be a great trip to Boston."" For the future Mrs. Enfield, it wasn't exactly love at first four-hour trip. ""No. No. But it worked out after a while,"" the ardent Oklahoma State fan told the Oklahoman newspaper. ""We got engaged pretty quickly after we started dating, and that happened fast, but, no (immediate attraction)."" So Amanda modeled and Andy continued to work as an entrepreneur (he also had a basketball shooting technique video and company). She traveled the world and he watched his company grow. He wanted to go back to coaching and thought it would be better to raise a family in a college environment. He got an offer from Florida State in 2006, joining the staff of a middling team in the powerhouse Atlantic Coast Conference. When the Florida Gulf Coast job opened up, Enfield e-mailed about it. Like so many people, he only had seen the young school's scores on the TV ticker and had never been to the campus. ""I didn't know much about the school when I took the job,"" he said, adding that Athletics Director Ken Kavanagh sold him on the idea of quickly making it a place to build a tradition. ""I wanted that opportunity, so that's why I took it."" Enfield signed a five-year contract (which may not stop larger schools from looking to Fort Myers for a coach this off-season) and quickly built a program almost from scratch. There are just two seniors and two juniors on this year's roster. He recruited four high school seniors and one transfer. The young Eagles are exciting to watch, and their high-flying offense and highlight reel jams have given Fort Myers a new nickname -- Dunk City. ""I'm pretty confident that we can run with anybody,"" said Eddie Murray, a 6-foot-8 senior forward. ""We don't have the typical big body guys. We have the long, athletic guys who want to run."" They also play tough defense, just like Florida State. Enfield knows that when it comes to recruiting, he's not necessarily going to get guys ready for Division I. Those players go to Kentucky or Duke or other top schools, he said. He gets players who have some talent -- and some flaws, he said. ""We have some of the most improved players in the country on our team this year. They've made huge jumps, and I think that's big in selling that recruiting,"" he said. Besides good technique, there is one other thing he teaches them. ""The biggest thing he's given me has just been confidence,"" Murray said. The Eagles are confident they can keep pulling off upsets like the ones they sprung on Georgetown and San Diego State. The Enfields' daughters are hoping the streak continues. ""My oldest daughter's focus is to go to Target to buy a dinosaur from the dollar bin, because that was promised after we got back from the tournament,"" Amanda Enfield said of their 6-year-old. Andy Enfield added, ""Yeah, I told her if we won the first game, she could get a dinosaur, and our other daughter would get a Barbie. They hit me up after winning the first game and said, 'Can we get another if you win a second game?' At that point I said, 'Sure.' (Laughs) And Amanda said, 'Hey you should ask for more than that.'"" On Friday, they face Florida in a game scheduled to begin just after 10 p.m. ET. Regional No. 3 seed Florida began the tournament as the 12th-ranked team in the country. Odds makers have the Gators as heavy favorites. Speaking of his intrastate foe, Enfield joked, ""It's just unique that we're playing them in the Sweet 16. I blame that on the selection committee. They should have put us in separate parts of the bracket, and we shouldn't have met until the championship game."" Whether Enfield's Eagles pull off an upset, one thing is for sure: Recruiting will be a whole lot easier when he has to call prospects' parents this off-season.","Andy Enfield's team is the first No. 15 regional seed to ever get to the Sweet 16 .

"(CNN) -- Meat grinders grinding people. Bathroom mirrors that bleed. And body parts -- everywhere. Sending you screaming will be the mission of the Goretorium when it opens this week in Las Vegas. Marketed as the only year-round horror attraction in Vegas -- the first of its kind -- the hotel-themed haunt is the work of Eli Roth, the actor-writer-director who has built a career on low-budget, blood-drenched horror films such as ""Hostel"" and its sequel. Roth will be making a special appearance on opening night, performing an illusion that's actually pretty dangerous, CEO Robert Frey said. Roth's surprise will be only the first of the evening. Get your kicks on Route 66 . The pitch is archetypal: the Goretorium is actually ""the Delmont,"" a '60s-era hotel whose owners make sure the guests enter -- and never leave. There's a haunted elevator, a go-go lounge and a chapel, which will be open for real-world weddings. A stew of horror tropes mixed with an eye for decade-crossing design, the Delmont has been planned down to its last detail, Frey said, including the costumes, sound design and even the slot machines featured in the lobby's casino. The scares themselves are just as carefully planned. At any one time, there will be 35 to 40 actors at work, many of whom have previous experience in ""haunt environments"" such as haunted houses. The floor plan is interactive and free-form, so attendees can choose their own path, whether that means a trip to the laundry room full of squeaky-clean human skin or a peek at the bathrooms, where the mirrors drip blood. But even though the Goretorium has been built with a flurry of high-tech tricks, the scariest moments aren't necessarily the most advanced, Frey said. Sometimes it's the low-tech stuff that guests should watch out for. One thing the Goretorium isn't afraid of is going stale. There are plans to add new scares often, Frey said. Tickets are $35 if purchased online. There will be new things to run away from as early as Thanksgiving and Christmas; it should take repeat customers six or seven trips to see everything, and that's the point. ""We'll get you when you least expect it,"" Frey said. TIME: Finally, booze comes to Disney .","The Goretorium is being marketed as the first year-round horror attraction in Vegas .

"(CNN) -- A raging wildfire has forced 32,000 residents to evacuate their homes near Colorado Springs, Colorado. Extreme heat and winds gusting to 65 mph fueled the Waldo Canyon Fire as it broke through containment lines Tuesday afternoon.

"(CNN) -- A cricketer who punched a rival international player in a bar has been fined and banned ahead of one of the sport's oldest and most renowned competitions. Australia batsman David Warner struck young England counterpart Joe Root in an Australian-themed bar in the English city of Birmingham in the early hours of Monday morning. Warner had to sit out Wednesday's Champions Trophy match with New Zealand, and Cricket Ausrtalia announced Thursday that he will miss the rest of the limited-overs tournament. As well as being fined $11,000, he cannot play for Australia until the first Ashes Test against England begins on July 10. His suspension will give other players a chance to take his place at the top of the batting order. ""Warner pleaded guilty to breaching Rule 6: Unbecoming Behavior. CA Senior Code of Behavior Commissioner,"" read a statement from Cricket Australia. ""The Hon. Justice Gordon Lewis AM, fined Warner AU$11,500 and suspended him from the remainder of Australia's ICC Champions Trophy campaign as well as the Australian team's two tour matches before the first Ashes Test against Somerset and Worcestershire. Warner will be eligible for selection for the first Test."" The Ashes is one of the oldest rivalries in sport, having first been contested in 1882. The series is played on a two-yearly basis, although back-to-back series will be played between July and January 2014. The scheduling switch was made in order to prevent the Ashes taking place directly before the 2015 Cricket World Cup, which will be hosted by Australia and New Zealand. World Sport Presents: Branded a Rebel . It is the second time in under a month that Warner has been cited for ""unbecoming behavior.""

Warner, who also aimed slurs at Craddock's colleague Malcolm Conn, took exception to an article Craddock had written about the Indian Premier League (IPL). Warner, who played for the Delhi Daredevils during the lucrative 20-over competition, was reacting to a piece Craddock penned in which he called the IPL a ""smoldering cesspit"" following allegations of corruption made against the league. The controversy surrounding Warner is the last thing an ailing Australia team needed, with captain and key batsman Michael Clarke struggling to recover from a persistent back injury ahead of the Ashes. Australia is also reeling after a 4-0 series defeat away to India in March. The last Ashes series, which was held in Australia between November 2010 and January 2011, was won 3-1 by England.","An Australian cricketer has been banned and fined for hitting a rival player .

"(CNN) -- The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill student who was slain this year was kidnapped from her apartment and forced to provide her abductors with access to her bank account before she was shot to death, according to court documents released Friday. Laurence Alvin Lovette Jr. surrendered without incident after a four-hour standoff, police said. Student body President Eve Carson, 22, was found shot to death in the early hours of March 5 in a suburban neighborhood not far from campus. Two men, Demario James Atwater, 22, and Lawrence Alvin Lovette, 17, have been charged with killing her. Police initially theorized that Carson may have been carjacked, saying she was extremely busy and sometimes worked in her office in the wee hours. But according to applications for search warrants unsealed Friday, a confidential informant told police in the days after the death that Atwater had told her he and Lovette entered Carson's home through an open door and forced Carson to accompany them in her car. The informant said she talked with Atwater after a picture was displayed on television showing someone attempting to use Carson's ATM card at a convenience store two days after Carson's body was found. The informant said the two men drove Carson to an ATM, obtaining her PIN from her. ""The [informant] learned that Carson was forced into the back seat with Atwater, and Lovette drove Carson's vehicle,"" the court documents said. ""That information is consistent with video footage taken from an ATM camera on that date."" The witness told police that Atwater said the two got about $1,400 from Carson's account. Bank records show that was approximately the amount taken from the account over a two-day period, the documents said. And the informant said that both suspects shot Carson, according to one of the affidavits. ""This information was corroborated by crime scene search information that two separate weapons were used in the homicide,"" the documents said. A partial shoeprint was found on a bank receipt Carson's Toyota Highlander, documenting a withdrawal made from her account by Atwater and Lovette, court documents said. The documents said police believe that Carson was subjected to a sexual assault ""of an unknown nature,"" and they asked for a search warrant to collect DNA swabs from the suspects. But Orange County, North Carolina, District Attorney Jim Woodall said Friday that the collection and testing done on Carson's body was routine and that authorities do not believe she was sexually assaulted. In executing the search warrants, police seized numerous pairs of shoes from both suspects. Carson was a pre-medicine student double-majoring in political science and biology. She was a recipient of the university's prestigious Morehead Scholarship and was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society, UNC has said. A senior and a native of Athens, Georgia, Carson was last seen about 1:30 a.m. March 5 by her roommates, who were leaving and invited her along. Carson was studying and declined, saying she had work to do, police said. Officers found her body in the street after neighbors reported hearing shots about 5 a.m.","An informant said Eve Carson was shot multiple times by two abductors .

"Bangkok (CNN) -- Four people have been killed in a fire that swept through a popular nightclub in the early hours of Friday morning on the Thai island of Phuket. It's not known whether those killed were Thai nationals or foreign tourists, as the bodies were burnt beyond recognition, director of Patong Hospital, Bhumin Silapan, told CNN. Eleven others were being treated in the same hospital, including seven Thais and four French nationals. One of the French patients was in a serious condition with 40% burns and receiving oxygen, Silapan said. Police are still trying to determine the cause of the blaze but the officer in charge of the case told CNN that it's believed a transformer near the Tiger Pub, also known as Soi Tiger, on Bangla Road, Patong, caught fire. ""I am interviewing many witnesses so I can't conclude the exact cause until I gather more information and evidence,"" Lt. Colonel Jongserm Preecha said Friday. Unconfirmed reports stated the fire was caused by a lightning strike which hit the transformer, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP), which quoted Phuket deputy governor Chamroen Tipayapongtada.

"(CNN) -- Residents near a fast-growing wildfire in Southern California were evacuated Wednesday as hundreds of firefighters tried to contain the blaze that had grown to 1,700 acres. One firefighter suffered minor injuries, the Riverside County Fire Department said. There were no exact numbers on how many people had been evacuated from what's being called the Summit Fire as of Wednesday evening, but authorities said a 200-unit mobile home park in Cherry Valley had been cleared. They also said some residents in Banning were told to leave their homes. Banning is about 25 miles west of Palm Springs. An evacuation center has been opened at the Banning Community Services Center, officials said. The fire department said on its website that 425 firefighters were involved in efforts to douse the flames. The state agency Cal Fire reported 30% containment of the blaze just before 7 p.m. (10 p.m. ET) Wednesday. CNN affiliate KTLA said at least one home was burned as 30-mph winds drove the flames. The National Weather Service in San Diego said a red flag warning was in effect until Friday evening. Forecasters called for wind speeds between 15 and 25 mph with gusts up to 55 mph.

"(CNN) -- The music was pounding, the lights pulsing. The concertgoers, who packed the club, were rocking with wild abandon to the sound of the band on stage. But the party quickly turned to horror as flames sparked by pyrotechnics swept up the walls and across the ceiling. This wasn't the Kiss nightclub in southern Brazil, where more than 230 souls lost their lives Sunday. It was The Station nightclub in West Warwick, Rhode Island, where 100 were killed during a show by '80s heavy metal band Great White. For survivors of that February night fire in 2003, the Sunday blaze in Santa Maria brought back memories of their own brush with death. Photos: Hundreds dead in Brazil nightclub fire . ""I can't help but watch because I'm one of them,"" Gina Russo told CNN affiliate WPRI-TV. ""It's just devastating that someone else has to experience it."" Russo suffered serious burns in the fire, but the flames claimed the life of her fiance, Fred Crisostomi. A sad sense of deja vu . In the years since the blaze, Station fire survivors have felt the same sadness numerous times: . In December 2004, when 194 people were killed in a nightclub fire in Argentina's capital, Buenos Aires; . In December 2008, when fireworks triggered a fire and panic at a nightclub in Perm, Russia, killing 156 people; . And in January 2009, when a New Year's Eve blaze at a Bangkok club claimed 64 lives. Now, the reality of another such tragedy tears at the heart of Dave Kane, whose 18-year-old son Nicky was the youngest victim of the Station fire. ""It hasn't stopped. Nobody has learned anything,"" he told CNN affiliate WJAR-TV. ""What else do you need to get through to somebody? I don't know what that is."" Sunday, The Station Fire Memorial Foundation offered its condolences and sympathies to those affected by the fire in Brazil. ""The loss of life and injuries sustained are almost too heartbreaking to comprehend,"" a statement from the organization said. ""One cannot help but notice the similarities between this tragedy and the Station nightclub fire that occurred nearly ten years ago."" Read more: 3 arrested in deadly Brazil nightclub fire . Fire brings changes . The Station fire brought changes to Rhode Island law, requiring sprinklers at buildings that can house more than 150 people and limiting pyrotechnics. The nightclub had had no sprinklers, and the foam used to deaden sound in the venue was highly flammable. Michael and Jeffrey Derderian, the two brothers who owned the club, pleaded no contest to 100 counts each of involuntary manslaughter. A judge sentenced Michael Derderian to four years in prison, but spared Jeffrey Derderian jail time with a suspended sentence. He received 500 hours of community service. Changes were made nationally, too. The fire prompted many states to pass laws forbidding pyrotechnics in nightclubs, mandating sprinklers and the presence of at least one trained crowd manager. Read more: How to stay safe . Living in the aftermath . For Russo and Kane, the years have taught them that time -- lots of time -- can sometimes gradually heal the emotional wounds. It's ""astounding pain, and your entire life gets completely mangled,"" said Kane, who wrote a book after the fire called ""41 Signs of Hope."" ""Only through the grace of faith and hope can you mange to pull yourself out and live again to start anew, because the sun does come up the next day."" Russo also penned a book after the tragedy: ""From the Ashes, Surviving the Station Nightclub Fire."" ""You can heal from it,"" she said. ""It just takes time and patience and to know you're not alone."" John Barylick, an attorney who represented victims in wrongful death and personal injury cases arising from the fire, knows the pain well, too. ""In coming days, Rhode Islanders will follow the unfolding news from Brazil with a sense of queasy deja vu -- the rising body counts, the victim identification process, the grieving families, and the assigning (and dodging) of blame,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- It was like a scene from a big-budget Hollywood disaster movie -- a Godzilla of a fire roaring down the mountain, straight toward Brandon Hanson's Colorado Springs neighborhood. Winds gusting at 65 mph pushed the fire over a ridge and sent it roaring into the city. Suddenly, a blaze in the mountains threatened to consume homes and businesses and change lives. Hanson, 29, snapped a photo from his driveway of the thick plumes of smoke, some spiking as high as 20,000 feet, and sent it in to CNN iReport. He'd just moved to Colorado Springs in April with his wife, Maria. Now their new house, their new life, was in peril. ""It's a lot worse than we thought,"" he ran in and told Maria. Hanson packed up his Nissan Rogue. Paperwork, passports, pictures. And baby things for Xavier, their 1-month-old son. Every hotel room in Colorado Springs was already occupied, so he kept driving south on Interstate 25 to Pueblo. Wednesday, the Waldo Canyon Fire had doubled in size and was only 5% contained.

Maria drew an arrow on a photograph showing their neighborhood, flames devouring houses everywhere. ""Our home,"" it said in white lettering. They still could not tell if they had been spared. The fire, fueled by high winds and hot, arid weather conditions, could be raging for some time to come. All the Hansons can do now is wait. They are not alone. The fire has forced about 36,000 people to evacuate their homes. One of them, Mindy Levinson, was forced to leave her apartment Tuesday, accompanied by her young son. She regrets she didn't take photos and other mementos. ""It was like Armageddon. You couldn't see anything but dark smoke and glowing red all around you,"" Levinson told CNN's ""AC360."" Help for wildfire evacuees and first responders . Levinson said she doesn't believe her apartment has been affected. The curtain of flame was moving so fast that some people just had minutes to leave. At moments like that, you realize what's important. What to keep with you. For Scott Deed, it was the red, white and blue fluttering outside his house. ""This flag is my son's. I lost him in Iraq. I want to make sure I take that down,"" he told CNN affiliate KCNC. Patrick Sobecki, 18, didn't have much time to think about what to take with him. He had been sleeping after taking Percocet to dull the pain of having all four wisdom teeth pulled Tuesday morning. ""That's just one more thing I am having to deal with in the middle of all this,"" he said. Open story: iReporters share their harrowing views of the western wildfires . When his parents roused him from slumber, Sobecki grabbed his MacBook Pro laptop and a World War I book published in 1920. His grandfather gave it to him. The family fled the Peregrine neighborhood in northwest Colorado Springs on a two-lane road that quickly turned into a parking lot. About 7,000 people were trying to get out the same way. Sobecki said it took two hours to travel four miles. They found refuge at a friend's house on the east side of town, away from the fire. Sobecki was born and raised in Colorado Springs, and he'd seen fires before. But none like this. None that blazed into the city. He thought about Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper's words that it looked like nothing short of a full-scale military invasion. ""That is Colorado Springs, the city I was born and raised in, the city that is at war with nature,"" Sobecki said. Wednesday, Sobecki's family, like the Hansons, checked online sites and Facebook, anxious to know what happened to their homes. Mark Galley wondered whether he would see his house again in the Mount Shadows neighborhood. He wondered what had happened to his neighbors. It was raining ash, and the smoke blanket hung so heavy Galley couldn't even see across the street. It was surreal, he told CNN affiliate KUSA. It was scary. Becky Schormann made a pile at the front door of things to take with her. But she couldn't take everything. The fishing boat parked under her deck. The antique dishes from her grandparents. Her antique doll collection -- save one, the oldest one she owned. ""I keep telling myself it's going to be OK,"" she said. For Russ Wolfe, it's going to take a long time for it to be OK. Wolfe founded the Flying W Ranch more than 60 years ago, building it into a regional tourist draw. It served chuckwagon suppers and provided Western-style entertainment. Wednesday, Wolfe had nothing left. ""With much sadness we have to report that the Flying W Ranch as well as several homes in the Mountain Shadows area has in fact been burned to the ground,"" the website said. ""We ask that in this sad time that you remember the Flying W and the Wolfe family who has owned and operated the Flying W Ranch since 1953. New app tracks Colorado wildfires . ""If you have made an online reservation or a deposit your money will be refunded at a later date when we have had a chance to gather our thoughts,"" the website said. ""We ask that you pray for all the families within the area and assure you we will rebuild."" It will be another good, clean family show, Wolfe said. Jenny Stafford, whose husband is deployed, fled her Colorado Springs home with her two young children and her cat Tuesday afternoon. ""It was like nothing we have ever seen before in our life,"" she told CNN. ""We turned back to look, the flames were coming over the hill. Everything looked like it was on fire, smoke everywhere."" Meanwhile, the temperatures soared again Wednesday and the air was acrid with the smell of everything burning. Filmmaker Joshua Keffer closed his windows, even though he has no air conditioning, and kept working at home. People were still trying to go on with life, as though that were possible. Keffer was someone who marveled at the visual, in awe of the images of the angry fire. ""It was stunning to look at,"" he said. Especially at night, when the embers glowed hot orange against the blackness of the sky. But the truth quickly marred the images and tore Keffer apart. It wasn't just trees anymore. It was homes. It wasn't a fire somewhere out there anymore. The flames were among the people, in their city. 3 dead, 1 missing as sodden Florida bids Debby goodbye .","Fueled by high winds, the Waldo Canyon Fire doubles in size .

"(CNN) -- ""Uh-oh, I smell smoke again, hang on ..."" Robbie Trencheny, a 20-year-old programmer based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, walked away from our Skype video call to look at the billowing clouds of smoke outside. When he returned: ""Yeah, it really smells like a bonfire out here now,"" he said. As of Wednesday afternoon, the Waldo Canyon wildfire has burned more than 15,000 acres in the mountains just outside Colorado Springs. It's moving fast and doubled in size overnight. Several neighborhoods in the western part of the city, and part of the Air Force Academy, have been evacuated, and homes have been destroyed. Trencheny lives about five miles east of the blaze. An avid Twitter user, he saw the flood of discussion about the fire there, and he decided to help make it easier to follow the action. Monster fire terrorizes a Colorado city . So in about 45 minutes of coding, Trencheny and fellow coder Scott Siebold built the Waldo Canyon Wildfire Tracker. This app collects all tweets containing #WaldoCanyonFire (the Twitter ""hashtag"" denoting this event) and displays them in a constantly updated stream. At the top is a photo gallery showing all the photos posted to Twitter with that hashtag. ""We wanted to help in some way,"" he said. ""We figured we'd use our tech skills to help, since not many people in Colorado Springs have the skills to do this quickly. The pictures are the best part so far. They're really powerful."" Colorado Springs has a fairly small tech community, and most people there don't use social media much, aside from Facebook, Trencheny said. His online tool is something can can give anyone with Web access a window onto the public discourse about this emergency, whether or not they use Twitter. Most people think of ""apps"" as programs that you download and install on a mobile device or computer. But this is a ""Web app,"" delivered entirely through the Web browser. ""The first time you check it out, be prepared: This fire is moving fast!"" Trencheny said. To make it less overwhelming, he suggests making sure the ""retweets enabled"" checkbox near the top is unchecked to eliminate duplicate tweets that occur as people interested in the fire copy updates to share with their own Twitter followers. The information from Twitter comes from all sorts of places: from official agencies such as the Colorado Springs Fire Department to people in and near the city sharing what they're witnessing with other people around the state and the nation. ""Part of what makes this compelling is not so much reading every tweet but just getting a real-time sense of how fast this is moving,"" he said. Trencheny could add Instagram photos to this app, since like Twitter, Instagram offers an open application programming interface. But he hasn't, because not many people in Colorado Springs appear to be using Instagram much. However, Instagram photos bearing the #WaldoCanyonFire hashtag and cross-posted to Twitter are appearing in the app. Help for wildfire evacuees and first responders . ""I can't add Facebook posts, of course, because that's a closed network,"" he said. While this Web app can be viewed on a computer, it also works fairly well on smartphones and tablets. Trencheny says he will continue to improve the mobile interface Wednesday. This project isn't just about Colorado Springs. People in other cities facing wildfires (or any type of emergency) can reuse Trencheny's code base, for free, to spin off their own iteration. He's posted this open source code to GitHub, a popular resource for programmers who like to share what they create. In fact, Trencheny plans to spin off a version of the Web app to track other current wildfires in Colorado, such as the High Park Fire outside Fort Collins, which has burned more than 87,000 acres, or the Flagstaff Fire burning just outside Boulder. And he'll explore adding more features, such as a map or integrating photos posted to Flickr. Trencheny is part of the growing movement of ""civic coders"": programmers who enjoy building free tools and services to help communities. Sometimes these are solo efforts, but often civic coders collaborate, either online through resources like GitHub or in person at events called ""hackathons"" where coders self-organize into teams and compete to build software over the course of a day or a weekend. The nonprofit Code for America initiative is helping accelerate civic coding by fostering collaboration between coders, local or state governments, and community groups to solve problems. Some of this happens by deploying teams of coders to help government agencies, but Code for America also supports civic hackathons around the nation. Similarly, last year the Apps for Communities Challenge (a contest run jointly by the Federal Communications Commission and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation) awarded more than $100,000 in prizes to coders who built apps to ""make local public information more personalized, usable, and accessible for all Americans."" (See the winners.) Trencheny, who hails from the San Francisco Bay Area, participated in Code for Oakland, a civic hackathon for Oakland, California, now entering its second year. And the company he works with, Momentum, is building a platform to make it easier for nonprofits, government agencies and relief organizations to accept online and mobile donations. ""We're currently reaching out to fire departments and other agencies helping to fight the Colorado wildfires and provide relief services,"" he said. ""They all are seeking donations right now."" Trencheny also applauds local officials in Colorado Springs for doing an excellent job with communicating about the Waldo Canyon Fire via social media. ""They were on it right away. The declared a hashtag and encouraged people to adopt it. And they're being responsive to questions on social media and very open with the community there. That makes the content of the Waldo Canyon Fire Tracker so much more useful,"" he said. iReporters share their harrowing views of the western wildfires .

"(CNN) -- A man, who doused himself with gasoline and charged at an officer, burst into flames when he was hit with a Taser, police in Australia said Tuesday. ""He was carrying a lighter and pouring himself with petrol,"" said Inspector Bill Munnee with the West Australian Police. ""We don't know if the lighter set it off or something from the Taser."" Authorities have launched an inquiry into what happened Monday when an officer arrived at the 36-year-old man's house in the remote desert community of Warburton. Police had received a report that the man and some others were sniffing glue, Munnee said. At the sight of the arriving officers, the man ran out of the house with a container of gasoline and a cigarette lighter, police said. When he ignored the officer's command to stop, the officer fired his Taser stun gun -- and the man ""caught alight,"" Munnee said. When used, some stun guns emit an electric spark as they deliver an electric current. The jolt of electricity inhibits voluntary control of muscles, temporarily incapacitating the person. While the officer tried to put out the fire, a woman from inside the house threw rocks at him, Munnee said. The officer suffered both burns from the fire and cuts from the rocks. The man was airlifted to a hospital in the Western Australian capital of Perth, where he is undergoing treatment for severe burns. Police charged him with assault with intent to prevent arrest and possession of a deleterious substance. The rock-throwing woman was charged with assaulting a public officer. ""He has an extensive record of very violent behavior toward police and people,"" Munnee said of the man. ""He's not Mother Teresa or the Pope."" Two years ago, a man in Texas died in a similar incident when he too caught fire after he was shot with a Taser. In that case as well, the man had poured gasoline on himself and was resisting arrest.","Man holding a lighter, douses himself with petrol, charges police officer .

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- Suspects in an explosive inferno at a Russian nightclub that killed at least 112 people will face charges Monday, authorities have said. The fire broke out Friday night in the Ural Mountain area industrial city of Perm, sweeping through a party in full swing at the Lame Horse, a nightclub celebrating its eighth year in business. An estimated 300 people were in the club. Authorities have cited five suspects. Three people are suspected of violating fire safety regulations, and the director of the company that supplied and installed fireworks equipment in the nightclub could face manslaughter charges, said Marina Zabbarova, head of the Perm territory branch of the Investigative Committee. Authorities detained those four suspects. A court ruled Sunday that the four will remain under arrest for two months, according to local prosecutor Vladimir Rybailo. Another suspect was hospitalized, in critical condition. ""He is the owner of the Lame Horse premises,"" Zabbarova said. More than 170 interrogations have been conducted with injured people and eyewitnesses, said Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the Investigative Committee of the Russian Prosecutor's Office. At least 123 people were hospitalized, authorities said. The death toll climbed to 112 on Sunday, rising as people died in hospitals, according to the press office of the Perm division of the Russian Emergency Situation Ministry. Three victims were buried Sunday, Russian media reported. As of Sunday morning, 26 people remained at area hospitals, with the rest airlifted to burn trauma clinics in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Chelyabinsk and Nizhni Novgorod, according to the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry. Patients who were not transportable were being treated by medical teams that were sent to Perm with mobile hospitals. Russia was to observe a national day of mourning Monday, according to presidential decree. The four detained suspects were the co-owner, the executive director, and the art director of the nightclub, and a businessman who supplied and organized fireworks, said Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the Investigative Committee of the Russian Prosecutor's Office. Fireworks are suspected as the main cause of the blaze, but investigators are looking at other possibilities as well, including a possible short circuit, Zabbarova said. Toxic smoke killed most of the victims, she added. ""A lot of people were lying on the floor of the club,"" according to one young female witness. ""Those of them who breathed were carried out and put in cars. The biggest problem was that each ambulance took only one person. They didn't take any more. We were yelling at doctors, forcing them to take more people at once."" On Sunday, people in search of missing loved ones were looking through page after page of victims' names. Area residents placed flowers outside the burned club in memory of the victims, a scene that brought back memories of two other deadly club fires in Russia: one in Moscow in 2007, the other in Omsk in 2008. The tragedy shocked Russians, reeling after last week's derailment of a luxury express train from Moscow to St. Petersburg. That incident -- which killed 26 people and injured more than 100 others -- has been called a terror attack, the most lethal terrorist act outside of Russia's troubled North Caucasus region since 2004. In a televised address from his country residence near Moscow, President Dmitry Medvedev demanded that those responsible for Friday's fire receive the harshest possible punishment. He sent government officials to Perm to handle the aftermath of the fire, organize medical assistance to survivors and investigate. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin dispatched planes from Moscow equipped to carry people with extensive burns.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- You wouldn't know the punk band was Japanese, a culture self-programmed for propriety. I can't write the chorus (sung in English) of the band's favorite song here, as my editor would first delete the offensive word and then report me to my superiors. Let's just say it's an obscenity that begins with the letter ""F"" and rhymes with what hockey players call the vulcanized rubber disk that's hit into the goal. The four-piece band screams the word over and over again to a Ramones tune, ""Rockaway Beach,"" directed at the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), operator of the crippled Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear plant. If you haven't guessed it yet this band -- known as the Scrap -- is angry with TEPCO for a reason. Each member of the group was affected by the meltdown at the plant in northeastern Japan that followed last year's earthquake and tsunami. Why Fukushima will remain a threat . Lead singer and lyrics writer, Nobutaka Takahashi, lived in Namie, just a few miles away from the plant. He was evacuated as the plant leaked radiation across a swath of northern Japan. He is one of the 78,000 residents who have been unable to return to a 12.4-mile (20-km) exclusion zone around the plant, now a nuclear wasteland. The song is also about loss and sadness, said Takahashi. ""My family far apart, looks up at the same sky, shattered by earthquake and betrayal. There is no such thing as the truth,"" said Takahashi, sharing the lyrics of the song. Takahashi lost his home and all of his possessions. He has essentially lost his job because the company he worked with is based inside the evacuation zone. ""I can't go home,"" he said. ""I want to tell people the pain, sadness and isolation I feel because I can't go home."" A year after the disaster, Takahashi's story is one shared by many of the evacuees from the world's worst nuclear disaster in 25 years. Like Takahashi, all are uncertain about whether they will ever return home to their land and possessions. Most continue to seek refuge with friends and extended family members. During a recent visit to the Fukushima plant, the manager of the disaster spoke to reporters about the possibility of evacuees being allowed home. Takeshi Takahashi, no relation to Nobutaka Takahashi, said the return date remained ""uncertain,"" and that TEPCO would continue to do its best in conjunction with the government to help the residents return. The plant manager said some residents south of the nuclear plant might be able to return this spring. Namie, Nobutaka Takahashi's hometown, sits to the north. Namie is one of the more contaminated regions in the evacuation zone. Frustrated by the slow clean-up, Takahashi says singing is his outlet. It's also his reminder to anyone who is willing to listen that the nuclear nightmare continues a year after the reactor buildings exploded.","Band's songs directed at Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), operator of Fukushima nuclear plant .

"Ruidoso, New Mexico (CNN) -- For 15 years Kari Greer has been documenting wildland fires and the men and woman who battle them. ""I'm a trained firefighter; photography is my tool,"" she says. ""It's my service on the line."" In college Greer studied photography but spent her summers fighting wildland fires as a seasonal firefighter. After graduation it was an easy fit to combine her two skill sets. ""The bug bit, and I developed a kind of passion for it."" She now photographs fires from the front lines under contract with the National Interagency Fire Center, the federal outfit that supports wildland firefighting efforts. Her photos are available to the public and the news media and are used to train firefighters and to help better coordinate firefighting efforts. ""There are many tools in the tool box for fighting fire and showing what fire is all about,"" Greer says. ""It's kind of a mysterious creature. My tool is that I'm able to document that and present it to the people, to the public. When the fire is going on in their backyard, they are able to see what's happening, what's really going on out there."" Related story: Wind, heat my hamper Colorado firefight . As a fully certified wildland firefighter, Greer is able to safely move throughout an active fire to places most photographers could not safely travel. Like the rest of the firefighters she sleeps in a tent and generally works a 16-hour day, often for weeks at a time. She carries her Olympus E-3 camera and the rest of her photo gear and a full complement of safety equipment, including a fire shelter -- last ditch protection should fire overtake her team. ""When I'm in the middle of an active fire -- right over the shoulder of a firefighter who is actively fighting that fire -- I feel like I'm right there with him experiencing it, and my whole focus is to show the activity what's going on,"" says Greer. ""Why are they doing this, how are they doing this? I feel the heat, I feel the smoke, my eyes are watering with everybody else's and I'm sweating, probably pretty badly, and getting very nice and dirty."" Watch more about Greer and see more of her photos . There is an easy camaraderie among the firefighters -- often captured in Greer's photos. Despite the hard work and brutal conditions it's not uncommon to see firefighters smiling and enjoying each other's company in the middle of a fire, even as they remain focused on their work and staying safe. ""It's kind of a nice brotherhood and sisterhood,"" she says. ""It's like a family. You'll see people you see maybe once in five years. You'll run into them in one corner of the country and five years later you'll see them again, and it's like you pick right back up where you left off."" There are two sets of characters in Greer's photos: the fire and the firefighters. The good guys against the bad guy. The intensity of the fire comes through in her photos, but so does the passion, skill and commitment of the firefighters. ""I think it helps people develop an understanding of the situation and how firefighters are working,"" says Greer.

"New York (CNN) -- Former New York Mayor Ed Koch has been dead for more than four months, but a mistake on his tombstone likely would have amused him. Koch was born December 12, 1924, but his tombstone at Trinity Church Cemetery in Upper Manhattan made him appear 18 years younger than he was -- December 12, 1942, was set in stone. The company responsible for the etchings on the marker became aware of the mistake Monday. The transposed numbers were fixed Tuesday morning using composite granite, according to George Arzt, Koch's former press secretary as mayor and his spokesman until his death. The birth and death dates were added within the past 10 days, according to an etching company representative. Koch hired an inscriber after he purchased his tombstone in 2007. He was able to see the engravings were etched as he wished; however, there were no dates at the time, according to Arzt. ""Ed would have loved this attention and called the situation 'ridiculous!' "" Arzt told CNN on Tuesday. Koch was a U.S. congressman from 1968 until he ran for New York mayor in 1977. He served three terms as the city's 105th mayor, from January 1978 to December 1989.

"(CNN) -- Authorities expect to allow residents to begin re-entering some of their communities in fire-ravaged Bastrop County, Texas, this week as firefighters made some headway against the blaze at 50% containment. Four subdivisions will be reopened to evacuated residents Monday, with additional openings set for Tuesday and Thursday, according to a press release from the county. Despite the slight gains made by firefighters in Bastrop, however, homes continue to burn in a dry spell unseen since 1895. At least 1,554 homes have been torched so far in the nearly 180 wildfires that broke out over 170,686 acres last week, according to Victoria Koenig, a spokeswoman for the Texas Forest Service. Six people were unaccounted for Sunday in Bastrop County near Austin where the most damaging blaze was burning. Authorities are asking those who have not registered at evacuation centers to do so, and are also asking friends or family of those unaccounted for to check in if they know their whereabouts. In the wake of the fire, two people were found dead last week during searches of the charred subdivisions, the Texas Forest Service said. One person was identified Saturday as Vickie Keenan, 58, said Bastrop County Sheriff Terry Pickering. The Bastrop County Complex fire now includes the 719-acre Union Chapel wildfire, but on Saturday morning, all Union Chapel residents were allowed to return to their homes, officials said. The Union Chapel fire was 90% contained Saturday, officials said. Gina Thurman was among residents allowed to return to their homes last week. Her subdivision was mostly unscathed by the fire, but her home of 10 years as well as her next door neighbor's house were destroyed. ""I was digging around this morning and I stopped because it was still smoldering,"" she said Saturday. ""Basically, there is nothing to salvage, nothing to salvage."" Few recognizable items existed amid the ash and rubble. ""A few of the things I was going through on my list I was like, 'Dang it, you know, I'm going to miss that one,'"" Thurman said. ""But I have the memory. Close the eyes and you can see it, you know?"" Thurman plans to rebuild, noting ""it's just property, it can be replaced.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Tour manager Paul Gongaware warned Michael Jackson's 1993 tour doctor, ""Don't be a Dr. Nick"" -- a reference to Elvis Presley's last physician -- according to a deposition for the upcoming wrongful death trial. ""Dr. Nick was the doctor whose overprescription of drugs to Elvis had led to Elvis' death,"" according to a court filing by lawyers for the Jackson family. Presley collapsed in the bathroom of his Memphis, Tennessee, mansion -- Graceland -- on August 16, 1977, at the age of 42. While his death was ruled the result of an irregular heartbeat, the autopsy report was sealed amid accusations that abuse of prescription drugs caused the problem. ""Dr. Nick"" -- Dr. George Nichopoulos -- said later he was treating Presley for insomnia. He was charged with over-prescribing drugs to Presley, but he was acquitted. He later lost his medical license in another case. Presley's death came days before he was to begin a new tour organized by the concert promoter Concerts West. Judge: No cameras in Jackson death trial . Jackson died on June 25, 2009, at the age of 50. The coroner ruled his death was caused by a fatal combination of sedatives and the surgical anesthetic propofol. His personal physician -- Dr. Conrad Murray -- told investigators he gave Jackson nightly infusions of propofol to treat his insomnia. He was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, sentenced to four years in prison and stripped of his medical license. Jackson's death came two weeks before his ""This Is It"" comeback concerts, organized by AEG Live, were to have debuted in London. AEG got into the concert promotion business when it purchased Concerts West, a young company that had taken the name of Elvis' last promoter. Jackson's mother and three children are suing AEG Live, claiming the concert promoter is liable for the singer's death because it hired, retained or supervised Dr. Murray. Elvis' name could loom in the wrongful death trial which is starting this month in a Los Angeles courtroom, especially if his daughter takes the stand. Lisa Marie Presley, who was married to Jackson from May 1994 until January 1996, is on the witness list. AEG Live to put Jackson on trial in his own death . ""I am afraid that I am going to end up like him, the way he did,"" Jackson told his wife during their short marriage, according to a blog Presley published a day after Jackson's death. The Jackson lawyers used the Elvis and ""Dr. Nick"" reference to argue that ""AEG knew Jackson had suffered chronic substance abuse and drug dependency problems for many years."" Gongaware, now AEG Live's co-CEO, managed Jackson's ""Dangerous"" and ""HIStory"" tour between 1993 and 1997. ""Shortly after he joined the 'Dangerous' tour in 1993, Dr. Finkelstein was asked to treat Jackson for pain,"" the Jackson filing said, referring to Dr. Stuart Finkelstein, a doctor on the 1993 tour. ""Having observed signs of opiate addiction in Jackson, Dr. Finkelstein nonetheless administered Demerol by injection, and administered morphine intravenously in Jackson's Bangkok hotel room for 24 hours."" After that, Finkelstein told Gongaware ""he thought Jackson had an opiate dependency problem,"" the filing said. ""For three and a half months, the 'Dangerous' tour continued,"" it said. ""Another doctor attended Jackson regularly, on one occasion breaking into Dr. Finkelstein's bag to get opiates to administer to Jackson. Gongaware was there the whole time, in charge of tour logistics, aware of the various physicians present, and he discussed with Dr. Finkelstein Jackson's opiate problem."" When Gongaware warned Dr. Finkelstein, who the brief described as his ""close friend,"" not to become Jackson's ""Dr. Nick,"" he was ""warning me, you know, don't get all infatuated where you start administering meds to a rock star and have the rock star overdose and die on you,"" Dr. Finkelstein testified. Sharon Osbourne added to trial . ""Though those tours were hugely successful, Jackson's tour doctors, one of whom Gongaware had hired, were administering pain killers to Jackson, and Gongaware thus was familiar with Jackson's substance abuse problems,"" the Jackson brief said. AEG lawyer Marvin Putman told CNN, however, there ""were no indicators or warning signs of a problem"" with Dr. Murray. Murray was not Gongaware's first choice to be Jackson's tour doctor in 2009, according to the filing. He first called Finkelstein, who advertises himself now as an addiction specialist, the document said. While Murray has said he would invoke his Fifth Amendment rights to avoid testifying as his criminal appeal is pending, Dr. Finkelstein is expected to take the stand. AEG's lawyers will use Jackson's drug use history in their defense, arguing that it showed Jackson was responsible for his own death. ""Mr. Jackson is a person who was known to doctor shop,"" AEG's attorney Marvin Putnam said. ""He was known to be someone who would tell one doctor one thing and another doctor something else."" Jackson's 2005 child molestation trial, which ended in his acquittal, is relevant because it ""resulted in an incredible increase in his drug intake,"" Putnam said.","Jackson family lawyers invoke Elvis's drug use to make a point in death case .

"(CNN) -- Both President Obama and Mitt Romney flubbed the big question on jobs at Tuesday night's debate. Moderator Candy Crowley noted that Apple makes its iPhones and iPads in China and asked, ""How do you convince a great American company to bring that manufacturing back here?"" Romney talked about reducing corporate taxes, getting tough with China by making it ""play by the rules,"" and stopping its currency manipulation. Obama said that some jobs are just never going to come back because the labor wages abroad are so much lower than in America. What the president wants to do is to double U.S. exports and create new high-wage jobs to replace the low-wage jobs that have been sent offshore. Obviously, neither debater knows the details of how the dynamics of trade and globalization work. Why Apple will never bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. For starters, the iPhones and iPads are not really made in China. They are only assembled there. According to the Asian Development Bank, the assembly accounts for $6.50 of the final $178.96 wholesale cost of an iPhone. Researchers at the Personal Computing Industry Center estimate the assembly value of a $500 iPad at about $12. The major value of these devices is in the semiconductors, electronic displays and other key components. These high-technology and high-capital components are largely made in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and to a lesser extent Germany. A few are even made in America. None of these are low-wage countries. Japan and Germany, in fact, are high-wage countries. The labor component of making these parts is quite small. What about taxes? Japan's 39.5% corporate income tax rate topped the 39.2% of the United States until it was dropped to 38.01% earlier this year. So it's not exactly a tax haven or low tax jurisdiction. Nevertheless, Japan's computer chip and electronic display makers are major suppliers of components to the iPhone and iPad as well as to the whole range of competing phones, tablets and computers. Furthermore, Apple and many global electronics companies are already paying less taxes by dint of elaborate accounting schemes that funnel revenue to tax havens like Singapore, the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and Liechtenstein. As for China's practice of currency manipulation, it has been an irritant, but not an insurmountable one. Technically at odds with international trade and monetary rules, the Chinese government has intervened frequently in currency markets to keep the dollar strong and the yuan weak by buying dollars. More recently, China has allowed the yuan to rise closer to market rates, although many analysts believe it is still undervalued because present rates do not fully reflect increases in Chinese productivity. Romney may thus be justified in his critique. The risks of doing business in China must also be taken into consideration. In the past two weeks, we have seen Japanese factories in China trashed by mobs in the wake of a dispute between Japan and China over who owns a few specks of rocky islets in the East China Sea. Even if Chinese labor is cheap, incidents like these can be costly. The real reason that these kinds of jobs aren't coming back is that U.S. producers no longer know how to produce many of these product components. There is no significant U.S. producer of flat panel electronic displays. And U.S. semiconductor makers have continually been losing to competitors like South Korea's Samsung and Taiwan's TSMC. The jobs involved in the production of these components are exactly the high-wage, high-benefit jobs Obama said he wants to create. The only way to get them back is for the U.S. to regain the strong position it once occupied in making things. Obama seems to be edging in this direction with his call for spurring manufacturing. But a U.S. production renaissance will require a lot more than the president's piecemeal approach so far. It means we need a comprehensive competitiveness strategy similar to those now pursued by South Korea, Germany, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, China and others. It is not written that America must suffer a drain of ever more highly skilled jobs to overseas locations. To halt this dynamic, we must fight fire with fire. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Clyde Prestowitz.","Clyde Prestowitz: Debate shows neither candidate understands details of global trade dynamics .
Prestowitz: The major value of iPhones is in the semiconductors and other key parts .
He says U.S. producers don't know how to make these key components anymore .

"Colorado Springs, Colorado (CNN) -- U.S. Army Capt. Immanuel Mgana was half a world away from his home and his family in Colorado Springs on June 26, when he received a text message from his wife: It was an image of a house on fire with the words, ""This is our home."" ""I could identify the house because of my car, which was in the driveway,"" he said. Both Mgana and his wife, Melissa, had been following the news of the Waldo Canyon Fire, which had started three days earlier, but neither was aware of their home's fate until they saw that photo, which had been splashed across the front page of the Denver Post. From his post in the Horn of Africa, Mgana wasn't even aware that his family's home was in danger of being consumed by the wildfire. Just hours before sending that text, Melissa Mgana had scrambled the couple's three kids into a car and rushed to a friend's house, abandoning plans to celebrate their son Kael's 10th birthday. ""We had picked up the cake. We were just preparing for a birthday evening,"" she said. Amid the last-minute birthday preparations, Melissa continually checked local news reports about the progress of the massive fire as it bore down on Colorado Springs. At that time, the blaze had forced the evacuation of 11,000 people (that number would later triple), threatening 13,000 homes, and none of the fire had been contained. ""I was watching the news and I would run outside and look at the plume,"" she said. As the sky grew darker and more ominous, Melissa knew time was running out. ""When I looked up and saw the flames coming over the ridge is when I knew it was possibly very serious,"" she said. ""I just said, 'We need to get out of here.'"" iReporters share their harrowing views of the wildfires . She knew she made the right decision hours later, when she saw the Denver Post's front page. She immediately sent the image to her husband, who showed the photo to his superiors. ""The first thing they said was 'You need to go home,' "" he said. ""I was on the next flight out."" As he boarded a flight home, Immanuel Mgana stayed in touch with his wife, keeping tabs on the situation without telling her that he was homeward bound. A day later, he arrived at the home where his wife and three children were staying. ""I knocked on the door and I believe my daughter Grace opened the door first and she just stepped back for a moment,"" he said. ""She didn't know how to react, but after a few seconds she was just all over me."" The emotional pendulum swung from the despair to ""elation,"" Melissa said. ""There was a ring at the door bell and there he was,"" she said, still beaming at the memory. ""I felt so relieved. It was amazing."" ""This wasn't something my wife could do alone,"" Immanuel said. ""I definitely needed to be there for support. Also, the kids, they needed a father figure around."" The Waldo Canyon fire charred more than 18,000 acres and destroyed 346 homes, making it the most destructive in the state's history. At the height of the fire, 32,000 Colorado residents evacuated their homes. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. Are wildfires getting wilder? The Mganas have made a temporary home at a local hotel, where they spent the Fourth of July holiday. The couple's three children -- Kael, 10, Sofia, 5, and Grace, 2 -- splash around in the hotel pool while Melissa and Immanuel talk about their hope for the family's future. ""We just feel compelled to rebuild there,"" Melissa said of the lot where their home once stood. ""After 15 years of being together, we've weathered a lot of storms together and we just know how to get through things together,"" Immanuel said, putting his arm around his wife. ""It's a new beginning for us."" Wildfire victims face double tragedy .","Capt. Immanuel Mgana returned to Colorado Springs from his station in Africa .

"HERMOSILLO, Mexico (CNN)  -- President Felipe Calderon traveled to Hermosillo on Saturday to meet with health officials as the death toll of a day care center fire there grew to 38 children. A crib and baby seats lie outside a day care center Friday in Hermosillo, Mexico, as police cordon off the area. The cause of Friday's blaze remained unknown, but investigators concluded that the fire did not start inside the ABC Day Care, Eduardo Bours, the governor of Sonora state said. As of Saturday night, 23 children remained hospitalized, 15 of them in critical condition, Sonora spokesman Daniel Duran told CNN. Another 10 children had been transported to other hospitals: eight to Guadalajara, one to Ciudad Obregon, and one to Sacramento, California. A team of 29 medical experts in Hermosillo were deciding if any more victims would be moved to the Shriners Hospital in Sacramento, or elsewhere. In addition, six adults were injured, Duran said. ""Without a doubt this is the worst disaster we've had,"" Bours told CNN. The president arrived with Interior Secretary Fernando Gomez Mont and Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova to get firsthand updates from doctors and investigators, the state news agency Notimex reported. Calderon ordered the nation's attorney general to investigate the blaze. Most of the victims died from smoke inhalation and not burns, Bours said. But the fire was enough for the roof to collapse, he added. At the time of the blaze, 142 children were inside the ABC Day Care. The day care is for children ages 2 to 4, but Bours confirmed that children even younger were among the victims. All the children at the day care had been accounted for by Saturday evening, Bours said. A severely burned 3-year-old girl arrived Saturday at the Sacramento hospital -- where pediatric burn treatment is a specialty -- and was in critical condition, according to Dr. Tina Palmieri, assistant chief of the burn unit. The child was burned over 80 percent of her body, the doctor told reporters. She said the hospital normally can save just over half of the children with burns that severe. In Hermosillo, a large crowd gathered outside of the emergency entrance of the city's general hospital and many people consoled each other, video from the scene showed. ""They told me that this happened in a matter of five minutes,"" Hermosillo Mayor Ernesto Gandara told reporters after surveying the scene.","NEW: President Felipe Calderon travels to Hermosillo to meet with health officials .

"(CNN) -- When Athens was behind schedule in delivering the 2004 Olympic Games, the Greek government called Gianna Angelopoulos to take charge. Angelopoulos had already successfully led the bid committee that saw Athens awarded the 2004 Olympic Games. When she received the appointment in 2000 to become president of the organizing committee, she had just four years instead of the usual seven, to deliver a successful Games. She was the first female president of both a bid committee and an organizing committee for an Olympic Games . ""We were the miracle, we showed a different Greece, a can-do Greece in four years instead of seven,"" she says. Now Angelopoulos, who was named an ambassador at large by the Greek government, has written a book entitled, ""My Greek Drama"". The personal memoir captures her experience of running the Games along with an assessment of the country's financial crisis. In an interview with CNN, she says Greece should use lessons learned during the Olympics to turn around its fortunes during its current economic crisis, which has seen 64% youth unemployment, a bailout from the European Union and a crippling austerity drive. ""It's not by chance that the crisis came,"" she says. ""Politicians like to blame each other. They should have a lesson of how Greece performed during the Olympics. With the Greek economy in its sixth year of recession, Angelopoulos isn't just critical of how the government is handling the crisis -- she's also concerned about Greece's reputation overseas. ""The image of Greece around the world is that it's in crisis and Greeks are lazy and never perform. What I know about Greece is we created a miracle in the making of the Olympics. ""The Greece I know is so different from the Greece I see now. All this achievement was dropped, the politicians dropped it."" Angelopoulos, 57, who grew up in the island of Crete, trained as a lawyer and served two terms in Greek parliament. With her direct manner, she has won both friends and enemies among her fellow Greeks. In 1996, with Greeks still wounded from losing out to Atlanta 1996 for the centenary of the modern Olympic Games, Angelopoulos was asked by the prime minister to lead the bid for Athens to be host city in 2004. After a successful bid, Angelopoulos was initially excluded from organizing the Games themselves, but was called back in 2000 when progress was stalling and the International Olympic Committee was beginning to question whether Athens could deliver on time. Although questions continued to be asked about Greece's readiness, Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee, eventually described Athens 2004 as ""unforgettable, dream Games"". ""It's a woman's dream to achieve something unique and monumental for our country, and shows that women can do whatever they want,"" says Angelopoulos. ""We can break the glass ceiling and show that there's no such thing as mission impossible. ""I want this book to show about the effort and struggle that every woman and every young person can do to pursue his or her dream."" In preparation for the Olympic Games, Athens built numerous infrastructure projects, from a new airport and new tram line to renewed public spaces and state-of-the-art sports facilities. However, Angelopoulos says not enough was done to plan for the legacy, and many of the facilities went to waste. ""I'm saddened to see that state-of-the-art facilities are abandoned, empty, closed,"" she says. ""If people ask me about organizing a Games, I would say 'plan for the day after, not just for the Olympics'. The excellent facilities can really make a difference for the day after."" She adds: ""I went to successive governments and I urged them to show me a plan for the day after. ""They just told me 'you do your job, we have everything in hand'. They did nothing and lost the readiness of people to do things differently, to show the world a different Greece."" As well as the facilities lying empty, Angelopoulos says a return to the public spirit, which was evident during the Games, would help Greece through its current crisis. ""An Olympic Games is a unique opportunity to get citizens engaged with a noble cause,"" she says. ""We had no tradition of volunteering in Greece, but we got 165,000 wanting to help. It was like an army, but it was lost. ""Through this tough time for Greece, people are selling their houses, selling their cars, taking their children out of university. Imagine if this volunteer spirit and way of helping people was still in place? Things would be different. ""This kind of common spirit is needed in a country, not just in good times."" Since the Olympic Games, Angelopoulos has become active with the Clinton Global Foundation and Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, running a project which asks global leaders to share their experience with students. ""After my disappointment about how the politicians let down people I turned to the international stage and that's why I participated in the Clinton Global Initiative,"" she says. After her years out of the spotlight, Angelopoulos is embarking on a lecture tour in the United States, publicizing ""My Greek Drama"" and sharing her dream that Greece can soon be a proud nation once more. ""Even if there's a lot of drama in my book, I believe there's a better chapter ahead. We can be the authors of our own story,"" she says. ""My Greek Drama,"" published by Greenleaf Book Group Press, is out now.","Gianna Angelopoulos led the bid for Athens 2004, and returned to run the organizing committee .

"Islamabad (CNN) -- A Muslim cleric leading a self-proclaimed movement to clean up politics in Pakistan by throwing out the current leaders in favor of a caretaker administration called on thousands of supporters to join his campaign. ""It's the beginning of the revolution,"" Tahir ul Qadri told a rally in Islamabad. ""Dissolve federal and provincial governments by tomorrow morning; otherwise, the public will force them to step down!"" Qadri urged the demonstrators to remain in the capital until they achieve their goals. ""Now and onward, you have to take care of Islamabad,"" he said. He referred to President Asif Ali Zardari as ex-president and to Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf as ex-prime minister. ""Today, the president and the prime minister have become ex as (they) won't have their government tomorrow,"" he said. The rally was held Monday night in Islamabad's ""blue zone"" in the center of the capital. Qadri spoke early Tuesday. The group's numbers fell far short of what organizers of the ""Million Man March"" had predicted, with witnesses estimating that some 20,000 people took part. Many more followed the event on television as the participants, led by Qadri, headed toward Islamabad with police and soldiers lining the rally route. Video showed a convoy of buses, vans and cars packed with participants waving the national flag en route to the capital. Some joined the procession on foot. Qadri, who traveled in a bulletproof van, has promised a Pakistani equivalent of Egypt's Tahrir Square protests. When the marchers arrived at the rally site, near Parliament and the presidential home, they joined more than 1,000 other protesters who had arrived earlier in the day as part of a demonstration calling for cleaning up national politics before elections this year. ""We want change in the establishment and we want to save our country,"" one man told CNN affiliate GEO TV. Read more: Muslim scholar's fatwa condemns terrorism . After eight years in Canada, Qadri returned last month to Pakistan, where he is waging a campaign against the political elite. Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik, who visited rally sites Monday by helicopter, said the turnout numbers showed that Qadri's event had ""badly failed."" Read more: Islamic scholar who condemned terrorism: 'I am not afraid' ""We want change! We want change!"" chanted some demonstrators prior to Qadri's speech. One man in a male-only area told GEO TV viewers watching at their homes that change does not occur while sitting down. ""We all must rally and come together for change and a better future and stronger Pakistan,"" he said. One female protester, rallying in the space provided for women and children, said she was prepared for a long demonstration. ""We have come here with our bedding and food supplies,"" she told GEO TV. ""We will stay here for as long as it takes to change the present situation in Pakistan."" Qadri has called for a caretaker administration to replace the current government and to carry out election reforms. His suggestion that the judiciary and the military weigh in on the composition of the interim government has raised concerns in a country where military leaders have repeatedly seized power and ruled for long periods of time. Some Pakistanis, noting that Qadri served as a lawmaker in the early 2000s, when Gen. Pervez Musharraf was leading the country, have suggested he may be working on behalf of the military. Read more: Why Karachi's violence shouldn't define city . Qadri maintains that he is simply seeking to ensure a corruption-free electoral process. The current government and opposition have both rejected his requests for a caretaker administration, insisting that nothing will stand in the way of timely elections and the democratic process. ""We will not succumb to these illegal demands,"" Malik said last week. Party withdraws support . The only political party that had supported Qadri's demonstration, the Mutahida Qaumi Movement, withdrew that support last week. The movement is a coalition partner in the current government. If this year's elections take place without major difficulties, it would represent the first time in Pakistan's history that a civilian government would have made it through a five-year term. Supporters say that Qadri aims to effect positive change. Corruption is widely considered a chronic problem in Pakistan's political system; President Zardari has served prison time on corruption charges. The problem appears to be regional. Qadri's campaign comes more than a year after anti-corruption demonstrator Anna Hazare roiled Indian politics with a hunger strike that called for the introduction of strong anti-graft measures. Qadri gained worldwide attention in 2010 when he declared a fatwa, or religious ruling, on terrorism and said it ""cannot be permissible in Islam."" That occurred during his time in Canada, when he spoke out in videos and books. His supporters also point to his Lahore-based religious welfare organization, Minhaj ul Quran, which promotes ""true Islamic teachings."" According to its website, it has up to 280,000 members worldwide and works to build schools around the country to teach the Quran. CNN's Shaan Khan reported from Islamabad and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong, and Mark Morgenstein updated from Atlanta. CNN's Aliza Kassin, Saima Mohsin and Nasir Habib also contributed to this report.","A convoy of protesters reaches Islamabad Monday night after a long march .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer had to work a little harder than he did Friday but the 17-time grand slam champion rallied past Tommy Haas at a Wimbledon warm-up in Germany to move one match away from winning his first title of the season. In a battle of players over 30 -- Federer turns 32 in August and Haas is 35 -- the Swiss came through 3-6 6-3 6-4 in Halle. Mikhail Youzhny awaits in the final. In the quarterfinals, Federer dispatched Haas' fellow German, Mischa Zverev, 6-0 6-0 in under 40 minutes to register only the second 'double bagel' of his glittering career. Zverev was a wildcard ranked 156th and so Federer knew he would be tested more in the last four against Haas, who beat him in the 2012 Halle finale. ""Clearly I wasn't sure how well I was really playing coming into the semis,"" Federer said. ""Happily I was able to maintain a really high level of play. ""After losing the first set there is not much margin for error anymore."" Federer has endured a difficult campaign -- by his standards. His only other final came at May's Rome Masters on clay, where he was beaten by Rafael Nadal in straight sets. Then at the French Open he was upset by Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the quarterfinals. His last grand slam final came a year ago at Wimbledon when he downed home favorite Andy Murray for a seventh title at the All England Club. ""Honestly I'm playing pretty good for a long period of time,"" he said. ""Clearly I'm very happy to play the final tomorrow. It is a big final for me. After this we'll focus on Wimbledon."" If Federer defeats Russia's Youzhny on Sunday -- Youzhny, too, is a veteran who turns 31 this month -- he would capture his sixth title in Halle but first since 2008. Their head-to-head record suggests Federer should be the heavy favorite. He leads Youzhny, a 6-3 6-2 winner over second-seed Richard Gasquet on Saturday, 14-0. Murray in London final . Center Court in Halle benefits from a roof but it's not the case at the Queen's Club in London, and the other men's Wimbledon warm-up this week has been affected by adverse weather. More rain Saturday led to both semifinals being delayed, with organizers eventually shifting one to an outer court. Eventually Murray, like Federer, came from a set down to progress to the final. He beat fourth-seed Tsonga 4-6 6-3 6-2 in his first event since returning from a back injury, saving two break points at 3-3 in the second set. ""I managed to turn that match around against a top player,"" Murray told the BBC. ""He's one of the best grass-court players in the world."" At almost the same time, defending champion Marin Cilic ousted four-time tournament winner Lleyton Hewitt 6-4 4-6 6-2. With rain expected Sunday, organizers moved the final to 12 p.m. local time, two hours earlier than originally scheduled.","Roger Federer beats Tommy Haas in three sets to reach the final in Halle, Germany .

"(CNN) -- Angelina Jolie may not have been by Brad Pitt's side, but she was certainly on his mind. Pitt attended the New York premiere of his new film, ""World War Z,"" without Jolie, who was ""getting ready for World Refugee Day,"" Pitt told the assembled reporters. But asked to describe his feelings for his fiancee, he didn't mince words. ""She has always been the brave, bold individual that I fell for -- and sexy as ever,"" he said. Jolie recently announced she had undergone a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery after learning that she carried a mutation of the BRCA1 gene, which sharply increases her risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Jolie's mother, Marcheline Bertrand, died from ovarian cancer in 2007. Jolie was with Pitt at the London premiere earlier this month and said that she felt ""great."" ""I feel wonderful, and I'm very, very grateful for all the support. It's meant a lot to me,"" the actress told the BBC. However, not everybody was 100% behind Jolie. In an interview with the Washington Blade, singer Melissa Etheridge said she believed Jolie had made a ""fearful choice."" ""I have that gene mutation too and (the preventive mastectomy) is not something I would believe in for myself. I wouldn't call it the brave choice,"" she said. ""I actually think it's the most fearful choice you can make when confronting anything with cancer."" Etheridge, a cancer survivor as well, said she prefers to focus on good nutrition and reducing stress levels. Pitt, however, characterizes Jolie as ""heroic.""

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan opposition leader Henrique Capriles has announced that he will run in next month's presidential election to replace the late Hugo Chavez. He faces an uphill battle against acting President Nicolas Maduro, who was sworn in last week and was Chavez's hand-picked successor. According to state news, the candidates have until Monday to register for the April 14 election. ""Nicolas, I will not give you a free path,"" Capriles told reporters Sunday. ""You will have to defeat me with votes."" Capriles, 40, ran against Chavez last year and lost. But he mounted one of the fiercest challenges during the late president's 14 years in power. He accused the government of manipulating Chavez's death for political gain . ""My fight is not to be president. My fight is for Venezuela to move forward,"" Capriles said Sunday night. Maduro quickly fired back, appearing on state-run VTV to counter Capriles, calling him irresponsible. ""His aim is to provoke the Venezuelan people,"" Maduro said. ""He's looking for violence."" The sharp exchange gave a potential preview of what the campaign period might look like -- angry, bitter and deeply divided. Earlier Sunday, Maduro, 50, the ruling Socialist Party's candidate, picked up an endorsement from the country's small Communist Party. He vowed to continue the policies and vision of Chavez, who died last week of cancer. Chavez was a larger-than-life leader, who positioned himself as a champion of the poor and cast himself as a ""21st-century socialist."" Making the poor count -- a Hugo Chavez legacy . He was a polarizing figure, revered by legions even as others accused him of repressing dissenting voices and turning over once-independent institutions to partisan loyalists. ""I will be president and commander in chief of the armed forces because that's what Chavez ordered me to do. I will follow his orders, but I need the help of the people,"" Maduro said, according to VTV. When Maduro was sworn in last week, Capriles protested loudly, telling reporters in Caracas the ceremony was ""an abuse of power."" ""To be president, the people have to elect you,"" he said. ""The constitution is very clear."" Maduro addressed the upcoming election. ""May the best person win,"" he said. ""The people will decide.""","NEW: Henrique Capriles will face acting President Nicolas Maduro .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greece's top court ordered the government Monday to restart state broadcaster ERT, but only until it can set up a new media entity. The order partially overturns the government's controversial decision last week to take ERT off the air while it creates a smaller broadcaster with fewer staff as a budget-cutting move. The court ruled a ""minimum transmission"" must be restored at ERT in order to serve the public interest until the new broadcaster is ready. There was no immediate response from the coalition government, whose leaders are still holding talks on ERT's future. The government's decision to suspend ERT led to protests and prompted the European Broadcast Union president to urge Greece to reconsider. ERT's TV channels and radio services were pulled off the air early Wednesday, although some employees have continued to broadcast via the Internet. ERT said the decision meant 2,656 employees would lose their jobs. Greek unions also vowed to fight the decision, which comes as the country struggles with a mountain of debt, soaring unemployment and a lengthy recession. To meet its commitments to its creditors -- the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund -- the Greek government must dismiss 2,000 people from the wider public sector by the end of the year and 15,000 by the end of 2014.

"Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- When Burmese commuters have an accident they don't dial 911 or any ordinary emergency service. They call the country's version of Marlon Brando, a heartthrob in the 1980s and 90s who turned his back on the film industry to run a fleet of ambulances and bury the nation's dead. A household name in Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, Kyaw Thu has starred in more than 200 films, and even took home a Myanmar Academy Award in 1994 for best actor in ""Da-Byi-Thu Ma Shwe Hta."" He followed it up with best director for ""Amay No Bo"" in 2003, but by then his head had already been turned by the story of an old woman left to die alone in hospital. ""The doctor warned the patient's family that she was close to death. After that they disappeared. A few days later she passed away -- so this dead body had no owner,"" Kyaw Thu told CNN at this office on the outskirts of Yangon, Myanmar's largest city. He later found out that the woman's family couldn't afford a funeral service. At the time, it wasn't uncommon; poor families would often sneak out in the dead of night to bury their dead, he said. And so began the Free Funeral Service Society, founded in collaboration with multi-award winning late Burmese writer and director Thukha, which now also provides a free library, education, medical, dental care and disaster relief. From films to funerals . Kyaw Thu's decision to leave the film industry wasn't entirely his own. In 2007, he was arrested and later banned from the film industry after being accused of supporting the Saffron Revolution. That year, the Myanmar military staged a violent crackdown on the largest anti-government demonstrations since 1988. Led by monks, tens of thousands of Burmese marched through the streets to protest plans to cut fuel subsidies. Kyaw Thu doesn't deny that he helped them but says that the society's policy of aiding people ""regardless of social status, national and religion"" meant that no one was turned away. He says he's on better terms with the current government led by President Thein Sein, who came to power in 2011, ending 50 years of military rule. However, he says not enough is being done to repair the country's patchy public services and protect the country's poor. ""We are showing the government what we need to do,"" he said. He claimed the government is out of touch with what's happening on the ground, as are foreign investors, who he says go straight to the capital Naypyidaw to listen to politicians rather than the people. ""I want to make a suggestion: before they go to Naypyidaw they should meet the CSOs and NGOs who are really doing things for Burma so they know what's really happening,"" he said. ""So after they meet with the CSOs and NGOs they'll have information -- they'll know the reality. So they can criticize and they can negotiate and they can discuss with the government and other parties."" He says other parties need to do more to deliver on their promises by using their own funding, rather than seeing him as a bank. A country on the mend? Kyaw Thu spoke with CNN as hundreds of delegates arrived in the country for the World Economic Forum on East Asia, two days of talks on how the country can shake off the legacy of its past. As well as basic, if not non-existent, public services, the country is saddled with crumbling buildings, potholed roads, a patchy telecommunications network and an outdated electricity network that only services a quarter of the population of 60 million people. Under the control of military leaders, Myanmar's economy stagnated so much so that in 1990 its per capita GDP growth was at a similar level to that recorded in 1900, according to a recent report from McKinsey & Company. There's much that needs to be fixed, but money is needed. Kyaw Thu's society relies on donations and an army of volunteers -- around 500 a day -- who do everything from carrying caskets to preparing bodies for burial. Trained doctors and nurses man the hospitals and clinics where patients are offered everything from eye surgery to maternity care and blood transfusions. The extent of their work can be seen in hundreds of laminated photos pinned on notice boards, which line the halls of the company's headquarters. One shows a newly married couple -- still in their wedding clothes -- carrying a casket; they came to volunteer straight after the service, he said. Others show shots of aid workers digging wells and bringing supplies to cyclone-hit residents, students sitting learning in class and then, incongruously, a couple of images of mutilated bodies -- all part of a day's work for the society. Message to Burmese people: 'Please be united' Kyaw Thu may be incredibly popular in Myanmar, providing services that in many countries are promised by politicians, but he says he has no plans to enter politics. ""No,"" he said, shaking his head, ""I have no ambition to make a political party."" He says his motivation is altruism; he doesn't need power, glory or adoration. ""When we are giving the aid to the people, we don't expect any kind of benefit or opportunity. When we help, if they're happy, I'm also happy."" He supports Nobel laureate and leader of the National League of Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi -- her image hangs on the walls of his office -- but says Burma's people need to drop their unquestioning admiration of Suu Kyi and her father, the late General Aung San, and start following their lead. ""People are not following their speech. They are very impressed. They say we love Aung San Suu Kyi, we love General Aung San... but they're not following their policy. They're not implementing what they're saying. This is the problem with Burmese people."" Kyaw Thu is dismayed by the outbreaks of ethnic violence around the country that have strained relations between Burmese Buddhists and the minority Muslim population. He said the society has not been allowed to travel west to Rakhine State where Rohingya Muslims are alleged by human rights groups to be suffering systematic abuse amounting to ""ethnic cleansing."" ""They (the government) say it's very dangerous and very difficult. So we have no chance to go to the desperate people,"" Kyaw Thu said. He said the pace of Myanmar's transformation, from a military state to thriving democracy at peace with ethnic rivalries, depends on the attitudes of ordinary people. Decades of military rule had produced bad attitudes, he said. ""If the attitudes of normal citizens change and are good -- within five years it will change,"" he said. ""I want to give the message to all people in Burma: Please be united."" Han Thar Nyein contributed to this report.","Award-winning Burmese actor gave up films to operate free funeral services .

"London (CNN) -- The British Broadcasting Corporation's director and deputy director of news have ""stepped aside"" pending an internal review over a report that falsely implicated a former senior political official in a child sex scandal, the media organization said Monday. It is the latest fallout over the report that has rocked one of the world's oldest and most respected media organizations, and the move follows the weekend resignation of George Entwistle as BBC's director general. News director Helen Boaden and her deputy, Steve Mitchell, have been asked to ""surrender all their responsibilities"" pending the outcome of the review, the BBC reported. On November 2, BBC's Newsnight aired the sex abuse claims against a senior political figure of the 1980s. Days later, the victim admitted he identified the wrong man. The BBC aired on apology on Friday, but it did little to contain the fallout from the false accusation. It was the second major crisis to hit the BBC within months. In late September, the BBC became embroiled in a scandal over its handling of sexual abuse allegations against its late TV presenter Jimmy Savile. The scandal exploded amid revelations that BBC's Newsnight pulled a report into allegations against Savile ahead of a planned tribute to the late TV presenter by the news organization scheduled to air later this year. Entwistle and others were called in front of lawmakers to answer for the scandal surrounding Savile, who authorities say was suspected of having sexually abused young women and girls, sometimes on BBC premises. Boaden served as director of BBC News when the decision was made to pull the Savile report, the BBC reported. ""Ms. Boaden has overall editorial and managerial responsibility for UK-wide and global news and current affairs on radio, television and oneline,"" according to a BBC report. CNN's Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","Helen Boaden, the BBC's director of news, is stepping aside pending an internal review .

"(CNN) -- Longshot thoroughbred Mine That Bird plowed down a muddy track at Churchill Downs to win the 135th Kentucky Derby on Saturday by several lengths. Calvin Borel atop Mind That Bird crosses the finish line to win the 135th running of the Kentucky Derby. ""Fifty-to-1!"" jockey Calvin Borel exulted after the race, referring to the odds on his mount at post time. ""It's all in the head."" Borel and Mine That Bird worked their way up from the middle of the pack in the home stretch to finish with a 6¾-length lead over second-place finisher Pioneer of the Nile, a 4-1 pick. Musket Man, at 20-1, finished third. It was Borel's second time riding a Kentucky Derby winner, having won the 2007 race aboard Street Sense. And it was a bad day for favorites, with top overnight pick I Want Revenge scratched after trainers found a problem in its left front ankle and post-time top pick Friesan Fire finishing near the back of the 19-horse field. I Want Revenge wrenched its ankle while training on the wet track Friday morning, race officials said, and trainer Jeff Mullins said the horse is also not likely to run in the Preakness -- the second event in horse racing's Triple Crown -- on May 16. Churchill Downs veterinarian Dr. Larry Bramlage said the decision showed Mullins and owner David Lanzman ""are not getting swept up in Derby fever and making a poor judgment call today."" ""We have to err on the side of caution,"" Bramlage said. ""And so I would like to commend the owners and trainer as well for doing what's right by the horse until we can figure out what's going on."" The sport has seen two dramatic deaths in the past three years. Second-place thoroughbred Eight Belles had to be euthanized on the track after collapsing with two broken ankles just after crossing the finish line in the 2008 Kentucky Derby. And in 2006, Derby winner Barbaro's right rear leg shattered at the start of that year's Preakness. Veterinarians managed to save the horse in the aftermath of the race, but ongoing complications from the catastrophic injury led to the horse being put down the following January.","Thoroughbred was 50-1 longshot at post time.

"(CNN) -- Police in Omaha, Nebraska, said Friday they are checking into whether two cases of double homicide -- separated by six miles and five years -- may be linked. All four victims had ties to the pathology department at Creighton University Medical School. The comparisons arose Tuesday, when Roger and Mary Brumback, both 65, were found dead inside their Omaha home. Roger Brumback was a professor in the pathology and neurology departments at Creighton University. After 12 years at Creighton, where he had served as chairman of the Department of Pathology, Brumback had recently announced he would retire next month and move to West Virginia. When a piano mover arrived Tuesday at the house, he found an ammunition clip wedged in the doorway and Mary Brumback's body inside, police said. On March 13, 2008, 11-year-old Thomas Hunter and his family's housekeeper, Shirlee Sherman, were found dead in the Hunters' home in Omaha, according to the FBI. The boy's father, Dr. William Hunter, was then and is still faculty member in Creighton's 12-person pathology department. He did not immediately return a call from CNN, but he told the Omaha World-Herald that he wondered if the same person could have been responsible. ""It's just a thought that comes by,"" he told the newspaper. His wife, Dr. Claire Hunter, an associate professor in Creighton's cardiology division, also did not immediately return a call. A cold-case unit is assisting to determine whether there is a connection between the cases, police said. Brumback's colleagues ""described him as a perfectionist who was very popular with his students and other faculty,"" the school said on its website. ""When I heard the news last night, I was literally shaken,"" Laura Neece-Baltaro, a friend of the Brumback family, told CNN affiliate KETV. She met them when they all lived in Oklahoma in the 1990s. ""Why would anyone want to harm them? They did so much for the community here, and the community in Oklahoma City and they were still contributing. They still had a lot to give back,"" she said. ""It's a terrible loss to the whole world that they're no longer with us."" A prayer service was held Thursday at the school for the couple. Students wore white coats in tribute. ""It's just kind of shocking to have somebody that seemed so full of life and invincible taken so suddenly,"" said Creighton medical student Justin McCarthy, KETV reported.

"(CNN) -- A transsexual woman has won on appeal the right to marry her boyfriend, a decision poised to rewrite Hong Kong's marriage law. The appellant -- known only by the initial ""W"" -- is a post-operative male-to-female transsexual who was refused the right to marry because she did not quality as a ""woman"" under Hong Kong law. The Court of Final Appeal ruled 4-1 Monday that the restriction was unconstitutional. The 37-year-old woman -- who had a government-subsidized sex change operation -- had twice lost her case at lower courts. ""I may have born a man but after transgender surgery at a government hospital more than five years ago, I've lived my life as a woman and been treated as a woman in all respects except as regards my right to marry,"" W said in a statement to local reporters through her attorney, Michael Vidler, according to the South China Morning Press. ""This decision rights that wrong, and I'm very happy the Court of [Final] Appeal now recognizes my desire to marry my boyfriend one day, and that desire is no different to that of any other woman who seeks the same here in Hong Kong."" The court decision will not come into effect for 12 months to give the Hong Kong legislature the opportunity to address the portion of the law deemed unconstitutional. ""We should make it clear that nothing in this judgment is intended to address the question of same sex marriage,"" Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma Tao-li and Judge Robert Ribeiro wrote in their majority decision. The majority found the idea that a ""woman"" is a biological criteria fixed at birth ""is particularly hard to justify in the light of significant medical advances in the treatment of transsexualism and important changes in the understanding of and social attitudes towards transsexual persons which have occurred over the last 40 odd years."" The only dissenting judge -- Patrick Chan Siu-Oi -- argued ""it is difficult and unrealistic to consider marriage to be entirely unconnected with procreation. ""There is no evidence that social attitudes in Hong Kong on the institution of marriage have changed to the extent that this concept of marriage has been abandoned or generally and substantially weakened,"" Judge Chan wrote.","A transsexual woman has won on appeal the right to marry her boyfriend in a landmark case .

"New York (CNN) -- Civil rights lawyers filed papers in federal court Monday seeking to prohibit the New York Police Department's surveillance of Muslim communities when there is no evidence that they are linked to terrorism or other illegal activities. The department's demographics unit -- or zone assessment unit -- was put together with the CIA's help after the September 11, 2001, attacks. The unit has acknowledged that it engaged in monitoring that included Muslim-owned business and mosques across the New York region. The motion filed Monday is part of a class-action case from 1971 that resulted in a historic settlement in 1985 known as the Handschu agreement, or Handschu guidelines. The settlement restricted police -- who were then accused of compiling dossiers on political activists and those perceived as radicals -- from investigating individuals whose activities were constitutionally protected. ""We think the surveillance of innocent Muslims is an infringement of civil liberties by the police and a violation of the guidelines,"" said Paul Chevigny, a New York University law professor and one of five attorneys on the Handschu case. Muslim leaders boycott breakfast over surveillance program . According to the guidelines, the police cannot keep records unless they find evidence of terrorism, and according to Chevigny, they have kept voluminous records on businesses connected with Islam. ""There's no indication of crime in connection with any of the organizations they've infiltrated,"" Chevigny said. Last summer the head of the city's police intelligence division testified that the controversial surveillance unit never produced a lead that linked to a potential terrorist plot during years of investigation. The unit's reports never led to a terrorism investigation in at least six years of surveillance, according to court testimony from Thomas P. Galati, the commanding officer of the police intelligence division. ""I could tell you that I have never made a lead from rhetoric that came from a demographics report, and I'm here since 2006,"" he said in a June 28 deposition unsealed last August. ""I don't recall other ones prior to my arrival. Again, that's always a possibility. I am not aware of any."" A 60-page report obtained by The Associated Press in 2012 showed police department maps of Newark, New Jersey, and photographs of Muslim residences and mosques, while other reports revealed that authorities had tracked websites and on at least one occasion placed an undercover officer among university students. There was no statement in the documents regarding terrorism or other criminal activity. However, in 2011 civil rights attorneys filed papers in federal court challenging whether the use of undercover agents and informants within Muslim communities constituted a breach of those guidelines. Last year New York Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said that the ""premise that the demographic unit was used for wholesale spying on Muslims, using undercover officers and informants to do so, was false,"" and that neither ""confidential informants nor undercover officers were assigned to the demographics unit."" Browne added that ""the small unit, about eight people, surveyed places a terrorist might go to use a foreign language internet cafe, get a job off the books, find a place to stay, etc."" However, police did uncover information that ""led them to recommend that investigators take a closer look."" Police actions adhered to the Handschu guidelines, Browne added, which were modified after the 2001 attacks to provide authorities greater leeway in investigating potential threats. In the first expansive official description of the city's demographics unit, Galati testified last June that the department had collected information often based on ethnicity and language. ""Most Urdu speakers from that region (Pakistan) would be of concern, so that's why it's important to me,"" he said. Listening in on a conversation at a Lebanese cafe could also be useful, he added, allowing analysts to determine what part of Lebanon the cafe-goers were from. ""That may be an indicator of possibility that that is a sympathizer to Hezbollah because southern Lebanon is dominated by Hezbollah."" But ""related to demographics ... I can tell you that information that (has) come in has not commenced an investigation."" The purpose of the unit is to help ""identify locations if we're faced with a threat,"" he noted, offering investigators a better starting point when confronted with a possible attack. ""The police department needs to know where we should go and look for that particular terrorist,"" he said. ""A lot of information that the zone assessment unit captures helps us identify locations that we should look or not look for."" Last year New Jersey Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa announced that the NYPD did not violate New Jersey laws when it carried out surveillance of Muslim-run businesses across state lines. The findings were the product of a three-month review meant to address concerns expressed by Muslim organizations, who later filed a lawsuit in New Jersey federal court against the NYPD for unfairly targeting the Muslim community. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in March called reports of NYPD surveillance ""disturbing,"" though White House chief counterterrorism adviser John Brennan praised the city's efforts to strike a balance between security and the protection of civil rights.","Civil rights lawyers ask federal court to end New York police surveillance of Muslims .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal lost a set for the second straight match at the French Open before recovering to beat another tall, free swinging opponent. But the seven-time champion's 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 win over Martin Klizan of Slovakia took a backseat to Nadal's post-match comments. He wasn't happy with the scheduling of the second-round match and, unusually, criticized tournament organizers. ""I think everybody knows in this room that the schedule of yesterday was wrong,"" Nadal told reporters. Nadal was unable to start the match against Klizan on Thursday, as originally planned, because of bad weather. Nadal, though, was unhappy about being scheduled third on Court Suzanne Lenglen while his opponent in the third round, Italian Fabio Fognini, had an earlier start and completed his encounter Thursday. World No. 1 Novak Djokovic, in the same half as Nadal, also had a day off and Roger Federer advanced to the fourth round with a victory over Julien Benneteau. Nadal will have to play back-to-back days in the best-of-five set format, taking on Fognini on Saturday. ""I cannot play third after men's and girls when my possible opponent plays second after girls,"" Nadal, who lost the first set of his opener to Daniel Brands, said. ""That's not fair. And today I was playing almost three hours on court, and my opponent was watching the TV in the locker room. ""So if you told me, 'That's fair,' I say, 'That's not fair.' The only thing that I can do is be positive, smile, and try to win my match and try to be ready for tomorrow."" Nadal will take comfort in knowing that he beat Fognini, a talented right-hander and former French Open quarterfinalist, 6-1, 6-3 earlier this month at the Rome Masters. Federer, after taking on two qualifiers in his opening two matches, swept past Benneteau 6-3, 6-4, 7-5. Benneteau -- a winner over Federer this year and a five-set loser to the Swiss at Wimbledon last year -- was bothered by a leg injury. ""He beat me at Rotterdam this year and he was incredibly ready at Wimbledon,'' the 17-time Grand Slam winner said. ''But he wasn't in the best of form today, and you could see that he was a bit hindered by the leg problem he's had for the past couple of days.'' Federer will face another Frenchman in the round of 16, Gilles Simon, although Gael Monfils' tournament is over. The exciting Monfils, an upset winner over Tomas Berdych in the first round, blew four match points and fell to Tommy Robredo 2-6, 6-7(5), 6-2, 7-6(3), 6-2. For former top-10 player Robredo, a Spaniard who has returned from injury, it marked his second consecutive comeback from two sets down. Serena Williams, again, didn't need to put in the same effort as Robredo. She dropped two games to Sorana Cirstea, lifting her total to six through three rounds. Maria Sharapova, the defending champion, completed a rain-delayed 6-2, 6-4 win over Wimbledon junior champion Eugenie Bouchard.","Seven-time champion Rafael Nadal loses a set in Paris for the second match in a row .

"(CNN) -- Venus Williams' hopes of landing a fourth Miami Masters title were left in tatters after the U.S. star was forced to pull out with a back injury. The seven-time grand slam champion withdrew ahead of her third round clash with fellow American Sloane Stephens Saturday. Williams, ranked 18th in the world, had hoped to shake off the problem following her win over Japan's Kimiko Date-Krum. It is the latest setback for the 32-year-old, who in 2011 fought back from Sjogren's syndrome, an auto-immune disease which causes fatigue. ""Yesterday I was having some pain, and then just wanted to see how I felt in the warmup -- just not able to play today,"" Williams told reporters. ""It's really disappointing. This is just the kind of tournament you want to play well at. ""But I have faced disappointments in my life and my career. It's not the first, probably not the last, just have to get through it and stay positive."" Williams now hopes to return to action in Charleston, South Carolina next month. ""I've dealt with injuries before in my whole career,"" she said. ""I know how to hopefully recover quickly from them. ""I'm playing in Charleston, so that's really still my goal, to get ready to play there."" Her younger sister Serena went through to round four -- despite needing to resort to riding a bike to the event due to traffic problems. The top seed and five-time Miami champion battled to a 6-3 6-3 win over Japan's Ayumi Morita to set up a meeting with Slovakian 13th seed Dominika Cibulkova. Venus Williams wasn't the only big name to leave the tournament Saturday as Caroline Wozniacki crashed out after suffering a shock defeat by Spanish wild card Garbine Muguruza. The World No. 9 was stunned 6-2 6-4 just a week after losing out in the final at Indian Wells to Maria Sharapova. Muguruza, ranked 73rd in the world, will now take on Li Na in the fourth round. Chinese star Li saw off American Varvara Lepchenko 6-2, 6-4 as she continued her comeback from injury. The World No. 5 had been out of action for seven weeks after suffering an ankle injury during her Australian Open defeat by Victoria Azarenka. But while Li is still in with a chance of glory, Azarenka's hopes are over after she was forced to withdraw with an ankle injury of her own. ""It was really obvious what the decision was couple days ago already,"" Azarenka told reporters. ""I just wanted to give my 100 % possibility to play and today was my last test."" Maria Sharapova will be hoping to progress to the fourth round Sunday when she takes on fellow Russian Russian Elena Vesnina. Sharapova, who won at Indian Wells last weekend, eased past Canada's Eugenie Bouchard 6-2 6-0 Friday following a power outage. In the men's section, last year's runner-up Andy Murray eased into the third round with a comfortable 6-3 6-1 victory over Australia's Bernard Tomic. Murray, who won the tournament back in 2009, will face Grigor Dimitrov next after the Bulgarian overcame Simone Bolelli. ""No matter how you start your match you need to make your opponent work hard,"" Murray told Sky Sports after seeing off a disappointing Tomic. ""I didn't hit it unbelievable today but I worked hard. Once I got the breakthrough he made mistakes. But it is unbelievably hot and windy. ""It's tough to feel comfortable, maybe more than my opponent because I am used to the court and the wind and the humidity."" Elsewhere, Sam Querrey survived an almighty scare to win his first match since becoming the U.S. No.1. Querrey overcame Lukasz Kubot 4-6 6-3 6-3 to secure his place in the next round. ""I started out a little slow,"" he told the tournament's official website. ""He broke me the first game, but then he served really well rest of the first set. ""But after that, I felt pretty good second and third sets. I served big and hit my forehand well. I was pretty happy."" There were also wins for France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Italy's Andreas Seppi, Belgium's David Goffin and eighth seed Richard Gasquet. Sunday's action is set to include World No.1 Novak Djokovic, who is looking to win a fourth Miami Masters title . Djokovic, who destroyed Lukas Rosol 6-1 6-0 Friday, will take on India's Somdev Devvarman, currently ranked 254th in the world. But one man who won't be on court is fifth seed Juan Martin del Potro after he was sent crashing out in the second round by Tobias Kamke. Del Potro reached the final at Indian Wells last week, but was unable to see off 89th ranked Kamke.

"New York (CNN) -- An organ played ""New York, New York"" as pallbearers -- from the New York City Police Department -- carried the simple wooden casket with a Star of David through hundreds of admirers, friends, family members and dignitaries, and out of the Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan on Monday to lay to rest the city's brash and outspoken three-term former mayor, Ed Koch, who died of congestive heart failure on Friday. He was 88. ""I come today with the love and condolences of 8.4 million New Yorkers who really are grieving with you at this moment,"" said current New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg as he delivered one of several eulogies for Koch beginning around 11 a.m. ""Although Ed -- on the other hand -- has got to be loving all this attention,"" Bloomberg joked. ""No mayor, I think, has ever embodied the spirit of New York City like he did. And I don't think anyone ever will. Tough and loud, brash and irreverent, full of humor and chutzpah -- he was our city's quintessential mayor,"" Bloomberg said. ""He knew from the beginning that the key to success lay in throwing political caution to the wind. ""And it's easy to forget just how badly our city needed that kind of leadership -- because the New York that Ed inherited is almost unimaginable today: graffiti-filled subways, miles of abandoned buildings, filthy streets that were unsafe to walk in daylight, much less at night, a municipal government that was broke and had stopped functioning. ... Then came Koch,"" Bloomberg said. ""It is fair to say that the city we know today would not exist without him. Everything that David Dinkins and Rudy Giuliani and I accomplished has been built on the foundation that Ed laid."" Noting that Koch was to be buried at Trinity Cemetery in Upper Manhattan, Bloomberg added, ""Just think about it: a Polish Jew in an Episcopal graveyard in a largely Dominican neighborhood. What could be more New York -- or even more Ed Koch?"" Former President Bill Clinton, who cut short a trip to Japan to attend, addressed the mourning crowd next. Holding a handful of letters of advice and opinion Koch had sent him when he was president, Clinton said no one had a better feel for ""the impact of what government did on the real lives of people"" than Koch. The former president described how Koch advocated for tougher gun laws and said he would be proud of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo for his recent effort to toughen New York state gun laws. In his lifetime, Koch was known to look to his constituency and ask ""How am I doing?"" On Monday, Clinton seemed to turn the question back on him, ""Ed, we are all doing fine but we miss you and we miss you so much because we all know we are doing a lot better because you lived and served."" Koch's relatives spoke of him as a family man who always wanted to know what was going on in their lives. A grandnephew, Noah Thaler, recounted a time Koch bragged to Clinton about the young man's accomplishments. Diane Coffey, Koch's longtime chief of staff, said the key to Koch's gift for leadership was ""an ability to meet people on their own terms without ever diluting his own distinctive personality."" Also at the services Monday were New York's U.S. senators, Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand; former mayors David Dinkins and Rudolph Giuliani; Gov. Cuomo; former governor Mario Cuomo; and other current and former city, state, federal and international government officials, including the Israeli consul general, Ido Aharoni. ""By the force of his own personality he led New Yorkers to believe that our best days weren't behind us, and he succeeded,"" Schumer told CNN. Gillibrand described Koch as a great reformer and a friend from whom she'd ask advice on everything from Middle East policy to where to get the best Chinese food. ""He was mayor of this city during a time of crisis and he really brought the city together,"" she said. ""I think Ed Koch was himself. And too often nowadays people worry about how they look or what their image is or are they doing it right,"" said Christine Quinn, speaker of the New York City Council and rumored potential Democratic candidate for mayor in the city's 2013 election. ""Every time I asked him for advice,"" she said, he told her ""to do what I thought was right, to have fun and if people didn't like it just 'bleep' 'em. And not a lot of elected officials live by those codes today. And if you do the right thing and you have some fun, you're doing the best you could possibly do. And that's a good thing."" An honor guard representing the city's police, fire, parks, sanitation and correction departments and the sheriff's office stood by the casket for the ceremony. The service was officiated by David Posner, the synagogue's senior rabbi. A private shiva will be held Tuesday at Gracie Mansion, the official residence of the city's mayor, on Tuesday, according to the ceremony program, and the family is requesting that contributions be made to the LaGuardia Community College Foundation. Koch was a U.S. congressman from 1968 until he ran for New York City mayor in 1977. He served three terms as the city's 105th mayor, from January 1, 1978, to December 31, 1989.

"(CNN)  -- Bank of America CEO and Chairman Kenneth Lewis has been issued a subpoena by the New York State Attorney General's Office, which is investigating whether the bank violated state law by withholding information from investors, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN. Kenneth Lewis is the CEO and chairman of Bank of America, the nation's largest bank. Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has been highly critical of Wall Street firms in general and Merrill Lynch in particular for the way they have conducted themselves in the midst of a financial crisis. Last week, he accused Merrill Lynch, which was acquired by Bank of America late last year, of secretly doling out big bonuses before reporting a huge quarterly loss. ""Merrill Lynch's decision to secretly and prematurely award approximately $3.6 billion in bonuses, and Bank of America's apparent complicity in it, raise serious and disturbing questions,"" Cuomo wrote in a letter to Rep. Barney Frank, D-Massachusetts, chairman of the House Committee on Financial Services. In his letter to Frank, Cuomo said Merrill gave bonuses of at least $1 million each to 696 employees, with a combined $121 million going to the top four recipients. The next four recipients were awarded a total of $62 million, and the next six received $66 million, he said. In all, the bonuses for 2008 totaled $3.6 billion. ""While more than 39,000 Merrill employees received bonuses from the pool, the vast majority of these funds were disproportionately distributed to a small number of individuals,"" Cuomo wrote. ""Indeed, Merrill chose to make millionaires out of a select group of 700 employees."" The attorney general said Merrill ""awarded an even smaller group of top executives what can only be described as gigantic bonuses."" Cuomo also claimed Merrill handed out the bonuses ahead of its federally funded acquisition by Bank of America, which was announced in mid-September and closed by year's end. It ""appears that, instead of disclosing their bonus plans in a transparent way as requested by my office, Merrill Lynch secretly moved up the planned date to allocate bonuses and then richly rewarded their failed executives,"" Cuomo wrote. Bank of America has received $45 billion in federal bailout money, including $20 billion to support its takeover of Merrill. Bank of America reported a net loss of $1.79 billion for the fourth quarter. Merrill reported a net loss of $15.31 billion for the fourth quarter. Bank of America spokesman Scott Silvestri that Merrill was ""an independent company"" when the bonuses were awarded. ""Bank of America did urge the bonuses be reduced, including those at the high end,"" Silvestri wrote. ""Although we had a right of consultation, it was their ultimate decision to make."" Silvestri said the top executives for Bank of America ""took no incentive compensation for 2008,"" with an 80 percent reduction for the ""next level"" of executives. Top executives from Bank of America -- as well as Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, State Street and Wells Fargo -- appeared before the Financial Services Committee last week to explain how they spent the $165 billion they received from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. In the testimony, Lewis said he received no bonus for 2008 and was paid a salary of $1.5 million. Bank of America's stock, which traded higher than $40 a share in the past year, closed at a fresh 52-week low of $3.93 a share Thursday. It's the largest bank in terms of assets in the United States and is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina.

"(CNN) -- Security issues concerning North Korea have not become a major issue for South Korean voters, even after the controversial rocket launch that drew international condemnation last week. The most pressing issues for South Koreans at the polls on Wednesday, are similar to the ones that dominated U.S. voters when they cast their ballots in November -- the economy. Polls showed that North-South relations ranked fifth in the most salient issues to the Korean public, falling far behind job creation, economic issues and education. Less than 10% prioritized relations with Pyongyang, according to polls by the Asan Institute for Policy Studies. ""Threat perception overall toward North Korea has somewhat waned,"" said Jong Kun Choi, an associate professor of political sciences and international studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. After the announcement of North Korea's missile launch, about half of the respondents in a poll said they expected the rocket to have no effect in the election. ""The best reading of the data suggests that the launch will not have a strong impact on the election,"" according to the Asan Institute's report. ""It used to be the case that a major blow from North Korea would critically affect South Korea's election. However, this may not have a major impact as it used to be, because first of all, we are so used to it,"" Choi said. Steve Chung, who has examined the North Korean factor in South Korean presidential elections in the last two decades, said he observed that the regime is ""less and less important"" in this election compared with previous ones. ""This year, the inter-Korea atmosphere is not as strong,"" said Chung, a PhD candidate in the department of Korean studies at the university of Sydney. After signing an armistice agreement in 1953, the two neighbors have endured an uneasy truce separated by a demilitarized zone. South Koreans have become used to provocation from their neighbor, said Choi. ""It's been going on for the last 20 years, despite so many sporadic skirmishes, virtually nothing has happened,"" he said. ""Rather than people worrying about warfare, [voters] are much more worried about our welfare."" On Wednesday, Korean voters will choose between the conservative Saenuri Party's Park Geun-hye, and the left-leaning Moon Jae-in of the Democratic United Party. If elected, Park would become the first female president of South Korea. She is the daughter of former president Park Chung-hee, who stirs mixed feelings among South Koreans. Some claim he was a dictator who stifled opposition; others credit him with overseeing a key phase of South Korea's economic development. He was shot and killed by his intelligence chief in 1979. Moon, who served as chief of staff to former late president Roh Moo-hyun, is a former human rights lawyer. He was jailed in the 1970s by Park's father. Both candidates condemned North Korea's rocket launch earlier this month. But they are expected to pursue a more conciliatory line toward North Korea than the current president Lee Myung-bak, who took an uncompromising approach to dealings with Pyongyang. Park wants dialogue with North Korea, but her overall plan for engagement remains conditional, while Moon favors a transformative approach that promotes inter-Korean economic ties as an instrument for engaging North Korea comprehensively, according to Scott Snyder, a senior fellow for Korea Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. Park's policy of engaging with North Korea may not differ much from Lee's, said Christopher Green, manager of international affairs for DailyNK, which covers North Korea. Even if Seoul was to implement a policy of unrestricted aid for North Korea, there is little guarantee that the regime would respond. ""My personal suspicion is because the North Korean government is only interested in the welfare of a very small percentage of the people that support the regime, they don't care as much as people in the outside world might think about aid,"" Green said. An recent editorial published in the South Korean newspaper, Dong-a Ilbo, stated: ""Both contenders seem to fantasize that inter-Korean relations will thaw if one of them takes power."" In the months leading up to South Korea's election, North Korea's propagandists have occasionally dipped into the race, targeting Park. In September, a North Korean government website released a video of a ""Gangnam Style"" spoof containing Park's face stuck on a dancing figure. The video mocked Park's support for her father whose legacy still divides South Korea. Set to an upbeat 1960s big band instrumental soundtrack, the video includes images from the era of her father's rule. Earlier this month, Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party published seven questions for Park calling her stance on North Korea ""inconsistent, ironic,"" according to South Korean media. ""My perspective is that North Korea doesn't care about who wins the election,"" said Green. ""Yes they attack Park Geun-hye and do not attack Moon Jae-in, but that is rhetorical."" The bizarre North Korean actions are more for domestic consumption within its borders and for confusing the world of its intentions, he said.","North Korea security issues don't weight heavily on South Korean voters .

Polls show South Koreans prioritize economic issues, education ahead of N. Korea ."
"(CNN) -- Amateur football games across the Netherlands have been canceled this weekend in tribute to a volunteer soccer official whose beating death allegedly by teenage players has shocked the country. A minute's silence also will be observed before all professional games this weekend, the Dutch Football Association, KNVB, said in a statement. Players and match officials taking part in those games will wear black armbands, it said. KNVB also has taken out large ads in newspapers with the message, ""Without respect, no football."" The ads say that respect is ""more than a word"" and calls on people to show that they are against violence. The cancellation affects 33,000 amateur games that would have been played over the weekend, according to Dutch public media. Two 15-year-olds and a 16-year-old -- all Amsterdam club Nieuw Sloten players -- have been charged by Dutch police following the death of 41-year-old linesman Richard Nieuwenhuizen. Nieuwenhuizen's son was playing in the match for his club, Buitenboys, when the incident occurred in the city of Almere on Sunday. The linesman reportedly fell into a coma after he was beaten. He died the next day. The Dutch football association said it was encouraging clubs to open their doors and talk to each other about the tragedy. A Facebook page has been set up to allow players and fans to share their ideas, it said in a statement, and many amateur clubs are gathering people together this weekend to pay tribute to Nieuwenhuizen. ""It is unbelievable that something like this can happen on a football field,"" said Bert van Oostveen, the association's director of professional football. ""These are the volunteers our sport is built on, who we can't do without. ""Without respect, there is no football. This is also why we want to pay attention to this terrible situation. Our thoughts go out to Richard Nieuwenhuizen's relatives."" The football association said it had decided to go ahead with the weekend's professional matches so that fans and players would join together in a moment of remembrance and think about how to prevent such a tragedy recurring. ""The association cannot solve this problem alone. It cannot be solved only on the football field; there is no easy solution. A broad effort is needed, from government, schools, clubs, but certainly also from parents,"" said Anton Binnenmars, director of amateur football. Nieuwenhuizen's death resonated across the globe, with FIFA President Sepp Blatter among those extending condolences. ""Football is a mirror of society, and sadly the same ills that afflict society -- in this case violence -- also manifest themselves in our game,"" said Blatter, according to a statement on fifa.com. ""Nevertheless, I remain convinced that football -- through the example set by the tireless efforts of people like Mr. Nieuwenhuizen -- is a force for good, and we must continue to use its positive example to educate people against these wrongs."" On its website Nieuw Sloten said it was ""deeply shocked"" by Nieuwenhuizen's death, adding that it would ban for life the players found to be responsible, pull its team from the league and temporarily suspend all operations as a club. ""Violence should not be on the football fields,"" said a statement on the Nieuw Sloten website. ""And certainly not against referees, linesmen and all those others who volunteer each year to help over a million amateur footballers. We must do everything possible to eliminate these excesses."" Despite a population of 17.5 million, Holland has built an outstanding reputation for developing young footballers over the years, with its amateur youth clubs providing a strong breeding ground for the country's professional clubs. CNN's Gary Morley contributed to this report.","All amateur games are canceled this weekend, the Dutch football association says .

After publicly expressing interest in running for the U.S. Senate seat in New York vacated when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009, she ultimately decided against making a bid, citing ""personal reasons."" She made speeches at the 2008 and 2012 Democratic National Conventions, both times recalling her famous relatives -- in 2008, her speech served as a tribute to her uncle Sen. Ted Kennedy, and in 2012 she noted that ""like my father's election in 1960, this is one of those elections where the future of our country is at stake.""

"(CNN)  -- A bicycle with a sticker advertising a Florida punk-folk band forced the evacuation of a Memphis, Tennessee, airport terminal late Monday afternoon, authorities said. A pilot alerted airport police when he saw a bike with a sticker that read ""this bike is a pipe bomb"" parked near the passenger ramps of Terminal C at Memphis International Airport, according to the Memphis-Shelby County Airport Authority. ""Terminal C ticketing and baggage claim at the airport were cleared out,"" said airport spokesman John Greaud. ""A K-9 unit responded and found no explosive materials at the scene."" ""This Bike is a Pipe Bomb"" is the name of a band based in Pensacola, Florida, and this is not the first time in the band's 12-year history the name has caused a commotion. Bikes sporting similar stickers at college campuses in Ohio and Philadelphia led to building closures, arrests and the bikes' destruction by bomb squads acting on the assumption the sticker was announcing a real threat. The owner of the Memphis bike was taken into custody by airport police, Greaud said, but was later released because they had no grounds to hold him. Greaud said federal authorities were discussing possible federal charges, but a federal source said it was ""a non-event.""","Police alerted after pilot saw bike with sticker saying ""this bike is a pipe bomb""

"(CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden delivered a rousing address to the NAACP in Houston on Thursday, bolstering support for President Barack Obama and drawing sharp contrasts with the Republican Party on civil rights issues. On the heels of recent voter identification disputes, Biden strayed from his typical campaign speech to zero in on voting rights, arguing that Republicans were making it more difficult for certain group to vote. By implementing laws requiring voters to present official identification at the voting booth, Biden said, the GOP sees ""a different future, where voting is made harder, not easier."" Democrats have said that such laws are politically motivated and intended to suppress minority voting, given that fewer people in minority groups carry government-issued IDs. Republicans, meanwhile, make the case that such laws prevent fraud and protect the integrity of the system. The issue was a hot topic this week at the NAACP convention, where Attorney General Eric Holder spoke Tuesday and lambasted states that have considered or attempted to implement such laws, including Texas, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Appealing to the group's founding, Biden on Thursday urged the crowd to ""remember what (the NAACP) at its core was all about."" ""It was about the right to vote, because when you have the right to vote, you have the right to change things,"" he said. He called on the crowd to imagine what the Justice Department would look like under a Mitt Romney administration. ""Imagine the recommendations and who he's likely to pick for attorney general or head of the civil rights division,"" he said, drawing scorn from the audience. The vice president also touched on a number of other issues, including energy, health care, women's issues and education. In each instance, he compared Obama's policies with those of the Republican Party. He particularly faulted the GOP for obstructing what he considers key legislation since Obama took office. ""Their discipline is amazing, they have never let up,"" Biden said, referring to congressional Republicans. ""But neither has my guy. Neither has President Barack Obama. He has not given up. He continues to be driven by the character of his convictions."" This was Biden's first time addressing the convention as vice president, the NAACP said. ""The vice president is a longtime friend to the NAACP,"" said Roslyn Brock, the group's chairwoman. ""He has been a strong advocate for justice and equality over his decades of service in the Senate and the White House."" The president will miss the event because of a ""scheduling conflict,"" his campaign said. ""We declined a few weeks ago, and (the) NAACP was pleased (Vice President Joe Biden) was able to attend,"" an Obama-Biden campaign official told CNN. The president's schedule for Thursday initially appeared wide open, but a senior administration official confirmed Thursday morning that Obama and the first lady will give an interview to CBS during the day. However, the president did make a brief appearance in a pre-taped video that ran before the vice president appeared. ""If you keep standing with me ... I know we can arrive there together,"" the president said after delivering a few lines from his typical stump speech on helping middle-class Americans. Hilary Shelton, the NAACP Washington Bureau director and a senior vice president in the organization, said the White House never confirmed a visit. ""They were trying to work out something,"" Shelton said. As to why Obama could not attend, he added, ""It was that something could not be moved. Something was crucial. And unfortunately, they couldn't move it in a way they could get him here this week."" Obama addressed the convention in 2009. Last year, first lady Michelle Obama spoke to the group. Biden's speech Thursday came one day after Romney was booed during his own remarks at the NAACP convention, when the Republican vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature health care law. In comparison, Biden drew thunderous applause after trumpeting health care reform and emphasized that the law ensures coverage to ""8 million black Americans who never would have had insurance."" The one time the crowd gave a negative reaction occurred when Biden began to close his remarks. He received a standing ovation from about half the audience at the end. Meanwhile, Romney said the negative reaction he experienced Wednesday didn't come as a surprise. ""I think we expected that,"" he said on Fox Business Network. ""I am going to give the same message to the NAACP that I give across the country, which is that Obamacare is killing jobs."" Two African-American members of the House of Representatives found themselves split after Romney's appearance. ""He gets credit for attendance,"" Rep. Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana Democrat, said on CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""But perfect attendance doesn't qualify you to be class president. I thought it was a good gesture to go, but I thought his content was lacking."" Rep. Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, also said on ""The Situation Room"" that he expects Romney to get about 10% of the black vote come November, suggesting the GOP candidate's focus should be on unemployment and home foreclosures. ""African-American unemployment since 2008 is up 40%,"" Scott said. ""Home closures 25%. So what we have is the same message that works for the rest of America, works for the black community, too.""

"Beijing (CNN) -- Liu Ming Xing is a student at Jin Wei Elementary School, where her favorite class is music. The 13-year-old loves the class. ""It makes me feel good,"" she said. And she says about her school life at Jin Wei: ""This place is good, I like it. I want to stay here."" But she may have to leave. Liu's family migrated to the Beijing from the countryside for work, and Jin Wei is a school for migrants. But the surrounding community, once filled with families like Liu's, is under pressure as the government began dismantling the neighborhood to make way for new development. The school, funded by migrant parents, may soon close. ""The children of the rural migrants won't be able to continue to attend school in this area,"" said human rights lawyer Zhang Zhiqiang, referring to the area where Liu's family lives. In China, families are registered as rural or urban. When rural migrants move to the cities they live in a twilight zone: They can't access healthcare, social security or even public education as part of the nation's ""hukou"" system, which requires household registration. Migrant workers still must be registered in their rural town of origin, not the city to which they move -- which keeps public services out of reach for many who have flocked to cities for work. ""What makes this bad is that it violates the rights of migrants to live and work here,"" Zhang said. ""Secondly, and more importantly, it violates children's rights to get compulsory education because when parents are forced to move back to their hometown. Beijing has made urbanization a main goal for increasing domestic consumption and closing the wealth gap. Hundreds of millions have moved to the cities from the countryside in search of jobs. Last year, the urban population of the world's most populous nation exceeded the rural population for the first time, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. But activists say that the government's own policies are forcing these migrants out of cities and creating an underclass in China. About 250 million people -- equivalent to about 80% of the population of the U.S. -- are migrant workers in China. It's the children of migrant workers, like Liu, who are often hardest hit. ""They don't have a lot of connections back home. Their kids don't speak much of local dialect,"" Zhang said. ""The government is forcing these people to move elsewhere without understanding their difficulties."" But registration of children is tied to their parents, so children of migrant workers eventually will have to return to their parents' home village to register and continue their education. Beijing has pledged to reform the hukou system but is hampered because many social services are funded by local cities rather than the national government. ""The government is trying. They're definitely making efforts, they realize that this is a big problem,"" William Nee of the China Labour Bulletin said. ""The problem is the finances of the health care scheme and education are all done at the local level, so I think it's very difficult for the government at the national level to say, 'Okay, let's just reform the hukou system'."" The political cost of reforming the hukou system is onerous. ""The mayors and party secretaries of many major cities are concerned that if hukou is freed up, there will be a huge fiscal burden in providing services for these migrants,"" said Yukon Huang, senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment and former World Bank director of China. ""If you ask the residents, the established residents of the major cities, they would say I don't want more people coming, this may mean fewer job opportunities for us,"" Huang added. ""They also associate inflows of migrant workers in terms of crime, pollution or congestion. So this is going to be a political issue. And I think it is a political issue that requires very careful management,"" he said. ""China has been very successful in avoiding some of what I call 'the urban sprawls' in places like Calcutta or Manila or even Bangkok. In that sense, it's going to be a new challenge for China."" If reform is on the horizon, it may come too late for Liu's family, who is watching their neighborhood being torn down as her father recovers from heart disease. ""I just hope that my father can get well as soon as possible and that we will be okay,"" said Liu, breaking down in tears.

"(CNN) -- For the past five years now, we here at the international women's movement Femen have been waging an active campaign of resistance to the patriarchy in various corners of the world. We have been bringing the world the simple idea of women's liberation by means of sexual emancipation as expressed in highly visible acts of political protest. We believe that the enslavement of women began with the enslavement of their sexuality, so we therefore consider it legitimate to use their liberated sexuality as a symbol of women's worldwide liberation. We divide the patriarchy confronting us into three basic parts. First, dictatorship, as a tool for enslaving women. For this reason we are a democratic movement. The second part of the system consists of religion and the church, which have overseen the spiritual enslavement of women. For this reason Femen is an atheistic group motivated by secularism and humanism. Read more: Sexualized Femen protest 'naive and foolish at best' The third element of the patriarchy is the sex industry, which has been responsible for women's sexual servitude and is in fact the most ancient form of female slavery. For this reason, then, Femen sees sexuality as the organon and canon of women's freedom. Hence, our three basic postulates are democracy, atheism, and sexuality. From what we have related above, naturally the most hated institutions are those that stand for one of these three things or a mixture of them. The most obvious illustration of the patriarchy is Islamic theocracy, a symbiosis of political and religious dictatorship. In theocratic states, the position of women is horrifying and hopeless. We direct our fiercest criticism to such countries, and work in that part of the world is what most occupies our minds. A clear example of the ""Shariazation"" under way in the Middle East and North Africa is what our activist Amina Tyler has gone through. For having published in Facebook topless pictures of herself with ""F*** Your Morals"" written on her body, Amina suffered severe criticism and death threats, and was kidnapped, beaten, and subjected to humiliating treatment. Read more: Topless feminist protesters show what they're made of . This young woman claims her own family took her far outside the confines of the city in which she lived to spend several weeks in a village unknown to her. There, shut up inside a house, she underwent a forced ""Islamization:"" they made her read the Quran and took her every day to see an imam. Amina's family also declared her insane and compelled her to ingest large doses of medication. ""Because I was taking so many pills, I was sleeping all the time,"" Amina told me. ""And once I woke up, I understood that I didn't remember anything."" Amina finally managed to escape. A few hours after Femen activists attacked the president of Tunisia shouting ""Where is Amina?"" I received a phone call: ""Inna, this is Amina speaking! I've escaped from my family!"" After a long conversation about what she had gone through during her period of forced isolation, I asked her whether she thought it best for her safety to leave Tunisia for a while. Amina answered that she would not leave Tunisia until she had carried out a topless protest with other Tunisian girls who had already established contact with her. Our understanding of Islamism, according to what we have learned fighting against it, tells us that our criticism of it is valid and holds out much hope for the future. At the heart of Islamism lies the enslavement of women based on control over their sexuality. The hijab is at the same time both a symbol and a tool of this enslavement. A mass sexual protest inspired by our example will serve as the first step toward women's recovering their own nature and will be a turning point, sparking the dissolution of the Sharia and the return, to women, of control over the conditions of her existence, from the sexual to the political. I hereby both promise and threaten to deploy an entire network of Femen activists in Arab countries. We will hound Islamic leaders across the globe, subjecting them to desolating criticism. We intend to hound spiritual leaders who are personally responsible for mistreating women. A million Aminas will arise! And freedom, at last, will dawn!

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt's vice president, Omar Suleiman, met with representatives of key opposition groups Sunday and offered concessions -- including some that, if enacted, could bring dramatic change to the country. Among the ideas agreed to by the two sides at the meeting, according to a report on state-run television, was a future end to the military emergency law that has been in place since President Hosni Mubarak came to power in 1981. The two sides also discussed steps to ensure free media and communication and plans to form a series of committees that would oversee changes aimed at bringing about a representative government. The opposition leaders who met with Suleiman do not represent all the demonstrators who have held mass protests over the past two weeks. One of the groups represented in the meeting was the Muslim Brotherhood -- a group that, days ago, had said it would not negotiate until Mubarak left office. Members of the liberal parties Wafd and Ahrar have also engaged in talks with the newly appointed Suleiman. After the meeting, Suleiman sat down with six young people who, according to state-run TV, were representing the ""January 25"" movement, named after the date the protests began. But in Tahrir Square, some protesters slammed the idea that anyone representing them would meet with Suleiman. ""This is an insult to people like us, activists. Who are they to speak on behalf of the revolution?"" asked Gigi Ibrahim. ""I did not hear of any January 25 group when the revolution started,"" added protester Wael Abbas. ""Only now I am hearing these rumors. But I don't know who they are because they definitely do not represent us."" Some opposition figures also questioned the government's sincerity in Sunday's meeting, saying the talks and suggestions of possible agreement might be tricks intended to end the demonstrations with Mubarak still in power and security forces situated to prevent them from restarting. Mohamed ElBaradei, the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency who has returned as a major opposition figure, told CNN there was ""a huge question of credibility"" involving the government. ""Mubarak is a symbol of an outgoing regime and people have no credibility,"" ElBaradei said. ""If he doesn't leave, you know, the regime would retrench and then come back, you know, with vengeance."" Mohammed Mursi and Mohamed Saad Al Katatni, both with the Muslim Brotherhood -- an opposition Islamist umbrella group that is officially banned but tolerated in Egypt -- said their party insisted that the closing memo after the meeting note that the two sides agreed to the importance of a peaceful transition by dissolving parliament and what the Muslim Brotherhood calls the parliament's ""fraudulent"" representation. The group also insisted on an investigation into the deadly clashes in Tahrir Square last week, and that those responsible be brought to justice in Egyptian courts, the Muslim Brotherhood officials said. Based on the meeting, the Muslim Brotherhood expects that on March 1, the two sides will take the next steps toward amendments in the constitution and reforming of the parliament, Mursi and Al Katatni said. U.S. President Barack Obama expressed his belief Sunday that Egypt can have an orderly transition and a representative government. He also downplayed the prospect of the Muslim Brotherhood, which has voiced opposition to the United States, ascending to power in Egypt once its president, Hosni Mubarak, leaves office. ""They don't have majority support in Egypt, but they are well organized,"" Obama told Fox News' Bill O'Reilly. ""(But) there are a whole bunch of secular folks in Egypt, there are a whole bunch of educators and civil society in Egypt that want to come to the fore as well."" The statement on state-run TV said the two sides agreed to form a national committee to work on constitutional changes within a month. They also agreed to reject any foreign interference in Egypt and form a committee from the legal authority and political groups that would work together to suggest needed changes, according to the statement. If the emergency laws in place for 30 years were to come to an end, it ""would be a very significant move,"" Sameh Shoukry, Egypt's ambassador to the United States, told ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday. ""It has been a longstanding demand of most of the opposition and many segments of Egyptian society to guarantee that all political activity is undertaken under normal law and in the confines of the normal judiciary. So it would be a significant step and an indication of confidence that the political process is moving forward."" Many protesters are calling for Mubarak's immediate ouster and for him to stand trial. His announcement last week that he planned to stay in office through September's elections infuriated thousands and spurred further protests. But he also has vociferous supporters, who have clashed at times with anti-government demonstrators in recent days. The demonstrations Sunday generally seemed peaceful, often taking on a festive atmosphere. Among those taking part were members of Egypt's Christian minority, who held a Mass in Tahrir Square paying tribute to those killed during clashes. Egypt's population is 10% Christian, a minority mostly made up of Coptic Christians. Warning shots were fired in Tahrir Square on Sunday evening, as had happened other days, but the crowds stayed put. On the streets of Cairo, there were increasing signs of normalcy returning. Some shops reopened, traffic increased, and some banks opened for the first time since January 27. The nation's central bank imposed restrictions on withdrawals by individuals, but not by companies, said Ahmed Ismail, manager of the Abu Dhabi National Bank. The justice minister announced that courts would reopen Sunday and the government eased its daily curfew, making the hours 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq told CNN conditions Sunday were ""extremely better than yesterday."" He added, ""Hopefully tomorrow will get better."" Shafiq also said authorities have been told ""not to bother"" human rights activists and journalists, and that if there have been such problems, they are ""not intended."" He reportedly called state-run Nile TV to say that a Google executive missing for more than a week will be released Monday. There was no explanation as to the whereabouts or condition of Wael Ghonim, the executive. Mubarak will stay through September, Shafiq said. ""A lot of points must be covered before he leaves,"" he said, adding that the months ahead will make it easier for the government to ""fulfill the mission"" of preparing for new leadership. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke with Shafiq Saturday night, according to a statement from her department, which is urging all U.S. citizens to make every effort to leave the North African country. During that meeting, she stressed that a ""broad cross-section of political actors and civil society"" should be part of the government's transformation process, while also saying that harassment and detention of activists, journalists and others ""must stop,"" the statement said. Sunday's developments followed an announcement Saturday that key members of the ruling National Democratic Party resigned from leadership positions, in the strongest gesture yet to placate angry Egyptians. Mubarak's son, Gamal, was among those who resigned from party posts, meaning that he is no longer eligible to take over from his father. His decision effectively put to rest a widespread belief that the embattled president was preparing for a dynastic handover. The United States has been mounting pressure on Mubarak to step aside. On Saturday, Clinton, speaking at a security conference in Germany, said it is ""important to follow the transition process announced by the Egyptian government, actually headed by Vice President Omar Suleiman."" Obama, in phone calls with foreign leaders Saturday, emphasized the importance of an ""orderly, peaceful transition"" to a government that is ""responsive to the aspirations of the Egyptian people."" The diplomatic official who delivered a message from the Obama administration to Egypt's leadership this week, however, said Mubarak ""remains utterly critical in the days ahead as we sort our way toward the future"" and must stay in office. Changes are needed in Egypt to pave the way for a smooth transition, and ""the president must stay in office in order to steer those changes through,"" said Frank Wisner, a former ambassador to Egypt. ""It's his opportunity to write his own legacy."" U.S. officials emphasized that Wisner was speaking for himself, as an expert on the region, and not for the Obama administration.

"London (CNN) -- A Swiss whistle-blower Monday handed over what he said were secret Swiss banking records to WikiLeaks, the website dedicated to revealing secrets. Swiss banker Rudolf Elmer handed two discs to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at a news conference in London. WikiLeaks could release the secret Swiss banking records in ""a matter of weeks"" if it can process them quickly enough, Assange said. Elmer said he would not reveal the names in the records and said he was unable to say how many people were involved. Who is Rudolf Elmer? He said about 2,000 clients' records were included, but that because of the way trusts and corporations are set up, he could not determine how many individuals were involved. Elmer describes himself as an activist/reformer/banker. ""I think, as a banker, I do have the right to stand up if something is wrong,"" he said Monday, explaining why he was giving the documents to the website. Elmer is due to go on trial Wednesday in Switzerland for violating the country's banking secrecy regulations. He said he wanted ""to let society know what I do know and how this system works because it is damaging our society in the way that money is moved"" and hidden in offshore jurisdictions. He began looking into the issue when he was a banker in the Cayman Islands, he said. When he first looked into the problems of offshore banking he said it looked like ""a mouse tail,"" but as he investigated in the Cayman Islands and Switzerland, it became a ""dragon's tail,"" and finally a many-headed dragon. Speaking at the same news conference, lawyer Jack Blum said it was not always possible to determine who, if anyone, had engaged in ""criminal tax evasion."" Elmer aims to ""challenge Swiss Bank Secrecy at the European Court of Human Rights and the Swiss courts,"" he says on his website. He has worked at six offshore banking centers, he says. He has been engaged in a long-running battle with Swiss banks over secrecy, he said. He said he had approached tax authorities and universities with his data, but that no one was interested. He was about to give up, he said, when he learned about WikiLeaks from a friend. He said he was ""grateful"" to WikiLeaks for helping him ""send the message which I wanted to send,"" but that he was not trying to use it for ""protection"" as he faced prosecution.","NEW: About 2,000 client records are handed over .

"(CNN) -- At least 45 women and children were killed in the Syrian city of Homs late Sunday, opposition activists said, hours after the U.N. special envoy to Syria met with the country's president in an effort to reach a diplomatic solution to end the violence. The killings occurred in the Homs neighborhood of Karm al Zaytoun, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition activist network. Hadi Abdallah, a spokesman for the Syrian Revolution General Council, told CNN there were 47 victims -- all stabbed to death and burned after ""Syrian forces and thugs"" stormed their homes. Life and death under Syria's military onslaught . The LCC described the killings as a ""massacre orchestrated by the regime"" of President Bashar al-Assad. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or attacks in Syria because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists. The claims of fresh violence occurred the same day Kofi Annan, the U.N. special envoy to Syria, departed the country after two days of talks with al-Assad. On Saturday, Annan proposed a cease-fire, the release of detainees and allowing unfettered access to agencies such as the Red Cross to deliver much needed aid, a U.N. statement said. ""It's going to be tough, it's going to be difficult, but we have to have hope,"" Annan said Sunday after meeting with al-Assad for a second day. Annan, a former U.N. secretary-general, also proposed a start to an inclusive political dialogue that would ""address the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the people."" It was unclear whether al-Assad offered any assurances that he would agree to the proposals laid out by Annan. When asked whether he received promises of a cease-fire or the acceptance of humanitarian assistance, Annan responded, ""(those are) some issues we're discussing with the president."" The reported deaths of women and children in Karm al Zaytoun brought the total number of deaths across the country Sunday to 78, according to activist groups. CNN's Hala Gorani: Witness to killing fields . A livestream from a neighboring town purported to show some of the bodies from the massacre. Syrian state TV said the bodies shown were killed by ""armed terrorist groups,"" a consistent phrase the government has used to explain the carnage. But the vast majority of reports from inside Syria indicate the regime is killing civilians en masse in an attempt to wipe out dissidents seeking al-Assad's ouster. Earlier Sunday, opposition groups reported violent clashes between Syrian government forces and defectors and said government forces were randomly shelling civilian areas. In the Idlib province village of Aljanoudeyah, the LCC said shelling by government forces destroyed three buildings. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported 19 people were killed in Idlib. The London-based Observatory also said Syrian forces also shelled a bridge over the Assi River west of Rastan. The bridge had been used by residents trying to flee the city, according to the group. The attack destroyed the bridge, the group said. In addition to his meeting with al-Assad, Annan also met with members of the opposition as well as business and religious leaders. ""The transformational winds blowing today cannot be long-resisted,"" Annan said. ""I have urged the president to heed the old African proverb: 'You cannot turn the wind, so turn the sail.' The realistic response is to embrace change and reform."" At least 33 people died Sunday in places such as Idlib, Aleppo, Latakia, Homs, Daraa, Hama and the countryside around the capital of Damascus, opposition activists said. Meanwhile, in a phone call with a Binish town elder, a major general in al-Assad's military demanded the people of Binish hand over weapons used by defected soldiers and the rebel Free Syrian Army within 24 hours or the town will be bombed and stormed early Monday morning, according to the Binish Coordination Committee, part of the LCC. SANA reported that what it called terrorist groups killed a boxing champion in Aleppo and two special forces troops in the province of Hama. The news agency also said an official of the Baath Arab Socialist Party was kidnapped in the al-Ghouta area of Homs. The meetings Saturday and Sunday between al-Assad and Annan were the first time in Syria's yearlong crisis that al-Assad met with such a high-level diplomat. But the Syrian president quashed the possibility of negotiating with the opposition anytime soon. Syrian state-run media said al-Assad told Annan that he was ready to find a solution, but that such an effort would first require a look at reality on the ground and not rely on what ""is promoted by some regional and international countries to distort the facts and give a picture contrary to what Syria is undergoing."" He also reiterated that ""political dialogue or action cannot take place or succeed if there are terrorist armed gangs on the ground that are working on spreading chaos and target the stability of the homeland,"" the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) said. Both Annan and opposition members agreed that plans for a resolution cannot be implemented as long as the bloodshed continues. ""It is too early to apply a plan to resolve the crisis,"" said Abdel Aziz al-Khair, a member of the National Coordinating Body for Democratic Change. ""The situation on the ground ... is catastrophic. The United Nations says more than 7,500 have died in the past year, and at least one activist group says more than 9,000 people have been killed.

"(CNN) -- Half way to a popular waterfall at Yosemite National Park, the 15 members of a Southern California family decided to take a break from the trail at a footbridge that crosses the boulder-strewn Merced River. Somehow, two boys -- whether dipping their feet in the water or wading -- were swept away Wednesday afternoon by the deceptive current, park officials said. The 10-year-old drowned and a 6-year-old was missing, prompting a search and rescue effort. The boys are either half-brothers or stepbrothers, officials said. The tragedy occurred during the park's busiest month, when 750,000 visitors enjoy the verdant national treasure that is the size of Rhode Island. It was not clear whether the family, hiking on Mist Trail from the Happy Isles Trailhead, intended to go all the way to spectacular Vernal Fall, less than a mile from the footbridge. The unidentified 10-year-old became the park's third drowning victim of 2012, said ranger and park spokesman Scott Gediman. Efforts to resuscitate the youth were unsuccessful. A 57-year-old man drowned this year in the Merced River in the western portion of Yosemite and another man died on the south fork of the river in the Wawona area. Watch: Safety tips for camping . Although there was no sign at the footbridge, visitors pass a water warning sign at the trailhead, Gediman said Thursday. ""Yosemite is a wild place by definition,"" the ranger told CNN, adding parents should assess each situation. ""We try to provide the best and most accurate information we can to people."" Although river levels are lower this year because of a low snow pack, the Merced flows rapidly through a V-shaped canyon and chute channels, Gediman said. While the river is only several inches deep at the bank, the middle of the river can be four to five feet deep in places and thick with boulders. ""Whether it is a high water level or low, the Merced River flows year round and the current can pull anybody in,"" said Gediman. Nine people have died at Yosemite thus far this year, officials said. One visitor was killed when a tree fell and another died in a rock-climbing accident. Of the 20 deaths in 2011, seven were water-related, according to Gediman. In July 2011, a young man lost his footing, slipping close to the edge of the Vernal Fall waterfall. A female companion frantically grabbed for him but stumbled. Another hiker followed and the three died after they were swept over the powerful 317-foot falls. One body was found in August and two others were recovered in November and December 2011. From the archives: Rangers recover body of man swept over waterfall in Yosemite . Yosemite offers visitors spectacular views of mountains, falls and rivers, but park officials warn visitors to be careful. Rangers say some visitors partake in dangerous practices such as hiking treacherous trails in flip-flops, climbing over safety rails to take better pictures or swimming perilously close to waterfalls. Water is a major attraction at Yosemite, and most visitors swim and otherwise safely enjoy its lakes and rivers, Gediman said. Witnesses told park authorities that the three hikers who were swept over the waterfall in July 2011 had climbed over a safety rail. ""We don't station a ranger in every possible dangerous place that's out there,"" park ranger Kari Cobb said last year.

"(Mental Floss) -- Article II, Section 2 of the United States Constitution grants the president ""power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States."" With a stroke of his pen, the man in charge can make legal trouble disappear. As one might expect, this practice can be a bit controversial. President Richard Nixon signed and later was granted a pardon by the man who replaced him. President George W. Bush pardoned 19 people on December 23, 2008, but withdrew one of those pardons for Isaac R. Toussie a short time later. Let's take a look at some of history's more notable examples. 1. George Wilson . In 1829, George Wilson and an accomplice received death sentences for murder and robbing mail trains. His accomplice quickly took a trip to the gallows, but Wilson had influential friends in Washington. These friends beseeched Andrew Jackson for leniency on behalf of their friend, and Old Hickory relented. In 1830, he pardoned Wilson for his capital crimes; the mail robber would only have to serve a twenty-year term for his other misdeeds. It sounds like great news for Wilson, but when authorities presented him with the pardon, Wilson perplexingly refused to accept it. After much legal back-and-forth, Wilson's case came before the Supreme Court, which ruled that since the pardon was a bit of property, there was no legal way to force Wilson to accept it. Like his accomplice, Wilson was hanged. 2. Richard Nixon . Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal on August 9, 1974, and just under a month later newly installed President Gerald Ford gave his predecessor a full and unconditional pardon for any crimes he may have committed while in office. While many observers decried the pardon as evidence of some backdoor dealing between Ford and Nixon, Ford went on national television to explain that he felt the pardon provided the best way for the country to move on and close the discussion of Nixon's antics. Many Americans didn't buy this explanation, though; even Ford's own press secretary resigned in disgust. Ford conceded that the unpopular pardon probably hurt his chances for reelection in the 1976 presidential race. Mental Floss: How do ex-presidents make ends meet? 3. Peter Yarrow . This name may not be immediately familiar, but you'd probably recognize Yarrow's voice if he sang ""Puff, the Magic Dragon."" As one-third of the folk outfit Peter, Paul and Mary, Yarrow dominated the music and protest scenes of the 1960s. Yarrow had legions of young fans, but unfortunately, some were a bit too young. In 1970 he was convicted of taking ""improper liberties"" with a 14-year-old fan, an error for which he spent three months in jail. On his last day in office, though, Jimmy Carter granted Yarrow a pardon. Yarrow, for his part, admitted he made a huge mistake and later contritely said, ""It was an era of real indiscretion and mistakes by categorically male performers. I was one of them. I got nailed. I was wrong. I'm sorry for it."" 4. George Steinbrenner . Many modern fans may know Steinbrenner solely as the big-mouthed, big-spending owner of the Yankees, but in 1974 ""the Boss"" was also in a spot of legal trouble due to his shadowy connection with Richard Nixon's reelection campaign. After receiving 14 criminal indictments, Steinbrenner pleaded guilty to making illegal campaign contributions and obstructing justice. The plea resulted in Steinbrenner coughing up a $15,000 fine, and Major League Baseball suspended him for a total of 15 months. In the closing days of his second term, though, Ronald Reagan pardoned Steinbrenner for these offenses. 5. Junior Johnson . Johnson was one of NASCAR's first stars in the 1950s and 1960s, and he later became a wildly successful team owner in the sport. However, despite all of his triumphs at the track, Johnson had old legal problems hanging over his head. In 1956, federal agents caught the rising NASCAR star working a moonshine still in North Carolina; the arrest was particularly galling to Johnson because he was a legendary moonshine-running driver. He received a two-year sentence for the crime and spent 11 months in federal prison. Once Johnson got out of jail, he resumed his dominance of the NASCAR circuit, but he was bothered by the loss of his voting rights as a convicted felon. In late 1986, Ronald Reagan pardoned Johnson for his moonshining past. Mental Floss: The men behind your favorite liquors? 6. Rick Hendrick . Johnson's not the only racing figure who has received a pardon, though. Hendrick, the owner of the Hendrick Motorsports team that's included such famed drivers as Jeff Gordon, is also the owner of a giant chain of auto dealerships. During the import-crazed 1980s, getting Hondas in your inventory often meant bribing Honda execs to send you a larger allocation of the popular cars. Hendrick played this game for his dealerships, and in the process gave execs thousands of dollars in cars, cash, and even houses. I . In 1997, he pleaded guilty to mail fraud in connection with these shenanigans. His sentence included a $250,000 fine, a year of home confinement, three years of probation, and an order to stay away from his racing team. In December 2000, Bill Clinton pardoned Hendrick. Other Notable Pardons... 7. Patty Hearst: The heiress-turned-militant spent almost two years in prison for her part in a 1974 bank robbery before Jimmy Carter commuted her sentence in 1979. Bill Clinton later gave Hearst a full pardon on the final day of his presidency in 2001. 8. Every Confederate Soldier: On Christmas Day 1868, President Andrew Johnson declared a general amnesty that unconditionally pardoned everyone who'd fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War. 9. Roger Clinton: Bill Clinton's half-brother spent a year in prison after pleading guilty to cocaine distribution charges in 1984. When Clinton issued a flurry of 140 pardons on his last day in office, his little brother was on the list. Roger didn't seem to appreciate his second chance, though; less than a month later he was arrested for drunk driving and disturbing the peace. He later pleaded guilty to a lesser charge. Mental Floss: Presidential siblings and the headaches they caused . 10. Samuel Mudd, Edmund Spangler, and Samuel Arnold: These three convicted conspirators in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln served time for their crime, but all three received pardons from Andrew Johnson in 1869. 11. Brigham Young: Young doggedly fought against U.S. troops during an armed conflict as federal forces tried to install non-Mormon officials in the state. According to some accounts, Young considered burning Salt Lake City to the ground and taking off for Mexico, but he eventually decided to peacefully step down as governor instead.

"Rabat, Morocco (CNN) -- Demonstrators rallied Saturday in Morocco's capital, demanding the North African nation reform its rape laws following a teenage girl's suicide after her father said a judge mandated that she marry her alleged rapist -- allowing him to stay out of jail. Amina Filali, 16, died suddenly last week in Larache, a city in northwestern Morocco along the Atlantic coast. Her father, Lahcen Filali, told CNN that she was with her new husband when she ""fell into street (and) started vomiting."" By the time an ambulance arrived, the father said, ""It was already too late."" The girl died hours later at a Larache hospital. The state-run MAP news agency reported that Amina Filali had committed suicide, the stark nature of her life and death spurring hundreds to turn out for Saturday's protest in front of the nation's parliament. Lahcen Filali told Moroccan newspaper Hona Press that his daughter had ingested rat poison, doing so after her husband had severely beaten her. Police told CNN only that they were investigating the teenager's death, but didn't provide further details. Even so, the circumstances of her case have triggered outrage in Morocco, especially from women's rights advocates. ""This girl was (in essence) raped twice, the last when she was married,"" government spokesman Mustapha El Khalfi said Thursday, referring to the initial reported rape and the fact she was forced to marry her alleged attacker. The girl's father said he ""did not want to accept this marriage,"" which some have said was pushed in order to protect the family's honor. But ""my wife, my family and the court of the city of Larache"" wanted the union to proceed, as it did. ""The judge decided he must marry her, and I had no opportunity to refuse the judge's decision,"" the father said. ""I wanted to send (the eventual husband) to prison, and have my daughter stay with me until she became (an adult)."" Under Moroccan law, rape is punishable by five to 10 years of prison, with a sentence as long as 20 years if the victim is a minor, pregnant or disabled. But if the victim and the rapist marry, the attacker is no longer liable. In this case, Amina Filali's husband was never formally charged with rape due to the fact the family signed an agreement in court, according to the girl's father. ""Through this law, the rape becomes legitimate,"" said Fouzia Assouli, president of the Moroccan advocacy group the Federation of the Democratic League for Women's Rights, of the fact that an alleged rapist can avoid jail if he marries his victim. That fact has stirred anger and action in Morocco, including Saturday's demonstration in Rabat, which is about 170 kilometers (105 miles) south of Larache. Protesters held up pictures of Amina Filali, held up banners and chanted in Arabic, ""Let's ... end the marriage of minors."" Moroccan law defends ""family morals, but does not take into account the right of women as a person,"" Assouli told CNN. ""The terrible story of Amina Filali gives us more strength to move forward,"" she added. Morocco's government devoted much of its weekly meeting Thursday to reviewing the case. ""We need to study in-depth the situation with the possibility of increasing the penalties as part of a reform,"" said El Khalfi, the communications minister. ""We cannot ignore this tragedy."" CNN's Ashley Gallagher and Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.","Demonstrators rally Saturday in Rabat calling for changes in Morocco's rape laws .

"(CNN) -- A Syrian general was gunned down in the heart of the capital on Saturday, according to state media, as fresh violence flared in several cities and world powers mulled a way to halt the government's bloody offensive against civilians. An ""armed terrorist group"" assassinated Brig. Gen. Issa al-Kholi, a military physician who was the director of Hamish Hospital, in front of his Damascus house Saturday morning, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said. Three gunmen shot him to death, the media outlet said. The killing occurred ""In the framework of targeting the Syrian intellectuals and the medical and technical cadres,"" SANA reported. ""A number of efficient, skilled and specialized national cadres were assassinated by armed terrorist groups,"" said SANA, which cited the killings of a professor, a nuclear specialist, a teacher and a couple of engineers. Al-Kholi once headed the arthritis division at Tishreen Military Hospital and received medical training in Romania and Paris. Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said al-Kholi is from a powerful Alawite military family and is a relative of Mohammed al-Kholi, the former head of air force intelligence under Hafez al-Assad, President Bashar al-Assad's father and predecessor. The al-Assad family is Alawite, a minority in Sunni-dominated Syria that has a major presence in the military and government. Tabler said air force intelligence is a powerful unit that is in charge of missile systems and investigating military defections. Hafez al-Assad was in that military branch. Jeffrey White, a defense analyst also at the institute, told CNN that al-Kholi was not likely a senior officer or affiliated with a key regime unit. White said he believed the assassination was the first of a higher-ranking Syrian officer in the capital. The capital has not been engulfed with the same kind of daily violence other cities have during the 11-month Syrian uprising, but the killing and recent attacks in Damascus could be a sign that the resistance is spreading to the seats of power. Free Syrian Army Lt. Col. Mohamed Hamado said al-Kholi is ""definitely close to Bashar's inner circle"" and that his family has been close to both Bashar al-Assad and his father. The FSA is the anti-regime resistance group led by military defectors. The deputy head of the Free Syrian Army said the killing could have been carried out by the regime itself. The al-Assad regime ""is now assassinating and targeting anyone they suspect of joining the revolution or thinking of defecting. That may have been the case with General al-Kholi,"" Col. Malek Al Kurdi told CNN. Al Kurdi claims the regime ""assassinated"" the deputy head of the armed forces, Gen. Bassam Najm el-Din Antakiali, in September, even though state media reported that he died of an ""acute heart attack."" At least 30 people were killed in Syria on Saturday, including 12 in Homs, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. Homs, located in the country's west, is Syria's third largest city. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, another opposition group, put Saturday's toll at 46, 32 of them civilians. Over the past week, 687 people, including 59 children, have died, the LCC reported late Saturday. About two-thirds of those occurred in Homs. ""Today is the seventh day in a row we're under shelling -- nonstop bombardment,"" an activist named Omar said Saturday. He said government forces have surrounded the area with thousands of soldiers and dozens of tanks: ""Not the normal tanks. Big tanks. Russian tanks."" ""We just want from Assad to give us permission to move the injured baby -- they are just the babies,"" Omar said, referring to al-Assad. ""They have to leave the area to have a good treatment. ... He don't even let us save and treat our (injured) babies."" Unrest rippled in the south as five men in the southern province of Daraa were killed when a a tank attacked them in the town of Al Musefra, LCC activist Abu Oudai said. They were among 13 people killed in Daraa, where the government security crackdown and the nationwide uprising started in mid-March. Funerals were held, meanwhile, for 39 members of the Syrian army and law enforcement units. SANA said the officers were targeted while on duty near Damascus and in Homs. World leaders have tried to pass resolutions denouncing the regime's bloody crackdown, but have been stymied by Russia and China in sending a unified message. Almost a week after Russia and China vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution intended to stop the killing, Saudi Arabia has drafted a similarly worded document -- but one that lacks the same punch. The Saudi draft resolution will be submitted to the U.N. General Assembly, where vetoes are not allowed, but resolutions are not legally binding. The three-page draft ""strongly condemns"" the violations of human rights by Syrian authorities. It cites ""the use of force against civilians, arbitrary executions, killing and persecution of protesters, human rights defenders and journalists, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, interference with access to medical treatment, torture, sexual violence and ill-treatment, including against children."" The text was provided to CNN by a diplomatic source on the condition that it not be posted in full because it could be amended. The U.N. General Assembly will convene Monday. Both Russia and China, which have major trade ties with Syria, have said they support an end to the violence but disagreed with the text of the draft resolution they rejected last week. ""We do believe that, in order to stop violence, armed methods must be stopped not only by the government, but also by the opposition,"" said Russia's U.N. ambassador, Vitaly Churkin. ""That was the key flaw of the draft resolution."" CNN cannot independently confirm details of the fighting in Syria because the government has severely limited the access of international journalists. But virtually all reports from within the country indicate al-Assad's forces are slaughtering protesters and other civilians en masse. Opposition activists in Homs describe relentless bomb explosions from Syrian forces, wounded people bleeding to death in the streets because they can't get medical attention and snipers picking off civilians running for cover. U.N. officials estimate 6,000 people have died since protests seeking al-Assad's ouster began nearly a year ago. The LCC says the toll has far exceeded 7,000. Al-Assad's regime has insisted its crackdown is aimed at armed gangs and foreign terrorists bent on destabilizing the regime. But U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford said the truth is obvious. ""We know who's shelling Homs,"" he said. ""It's not the opposition, it's the government."" CNN's Salma Abdelaziz, Ivan Watson, Amir Ahmed, Joe Sterling, Richard Roth and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","NEW: Nearly 700 have died in past week, opposition group says .

"(CNN) -- A hard-hitting Kenyan movie about gang culture has become the country's first-ever film to be considered for an Oscar. ""Nairobi Half Life"" has just been shown at Film Africa 2012, which is currently taking place in London -- having already made history as the most successful theatrical release for a local film in Kenya, according to its producers. It's the debut film from Kenyan director David ""Tosh"" Gitonga, who says he wants to change views about crime in the country. ""We keep saying crime is wrong, but are we really looking at why there is crime?"" he says. ""I don't believe Kenyans get into crime for fun and giggles."" Prior to shooting, Gitonga wanted to understand the story behind Nairobi's crime culture and to fully comprehend the situation he spent time with real-life gangsters. This experience led him to hear stories of gang members flooding properties and defecating on porches after robberies. He was told: ""It hurts us that you have these things we don't have."" Watch a scene from the movie . Gitonga admits he was left speechless when asked whether it's fair that some are born into wealth, while others struggle to feed their children just one meal a day. ""I couldn't answer that question and it still haunts me today,"" he says. His film chronicles the trials and tribulations of the character Mwas -- a young aspiring actor from rural Kenya who dreams of becoming the next ""Bruce Willis."" Also on Inside Africa: Film shines light on Obama's Kenyan sister . Mwas moves to Nairobi in pursuit of that dream -- but experiences first-hand why some people refer to the city as ""Nairobbery,"" after being robbed of all his belongings on his first day there. Fighting to survive in the city, Mwas strikes up an unlikely friendship with a gang leader who introduces him to a world of theft and violence. This includes taking part in robberies and carjackings -- common crimes in Nairobi. According to the U.S. State Department, the city averages about 10 vehicle hijackings each day. Jitin Mediratta, a Nairobi-born lawyer, describes the movie as a story that hits home. ""I have been a victim of robbery with violence when I was living with my father a few years ago,"" he says. ""The truth about the thugs being young and nervous when carrying out the crimes is indeed true."" While Mediratta says the film ""humanizes"" the gangsters, he rejects feeling any empathy for them -- an opinion shared by his wife Isha, who adds: ""A crime is still a crime."" He does, however, want to know how the Kenyan government plans to improve the situation and tackle social injustices. It is a sentiment shared by Gitonga. He hopes the film will help government officials understand what is happening on the ground, even if just a minority of them take any action. Also on Inside Africa: 3D animation puts South Africa film in the picture . There hasn't been a formal response to the film from the Kenyan government, but Gitonga says some government officials have discreetly expressed ""a need to look at our country and make things better."" The movie has already received international recognition. Joseph Wairimu, who plays Mwas, won best actor at the Durban International Film Festival, in July. And the U.S. Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is considering whether to nominate Nairobi Half Life for an Oscar in the Best Foreign Language Film category -- the first time a Kenyan movie has been considered. Gitonga is also humbled by the positive response the film has received from Kenyans, since Kenyan movies don't usually attract large local audiences. He feels the movie has opened doors for other Kenyan filmmakers and African film in general. ""I want the rest of the world to go to the cinema and appreciate a world they don't know,"" he says.","""Nairobi Half Life"" considered for best foreign language film Oscar .

"Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- LeWeb founder Loic Le Meur is looking to ""digital hippies"" as a potential theme for his next conference. The French entrepreneur runs the biggest tech gathering in Europe and he's cautious to firm up a tagline too early. But when CNN caught up with him at the World Economic Forum in Davos, which he has attended for 11 years, he revealed what's on his mind. Why Davos matters in social media age . Le Meur is seeing a trend of entrepreneurs who reject money, fame and power -- they just want to be happy. They are digital hippies. Taking inspiration from events such as Nevada's art and music festival ""Burning Man,"" which he attended for the first time in 2012, Le Meur told CNN digital hippies are: ""Vegan, they don't drink alcohol, they want to know where their food comes from, they are trying to go slow when we are going fast."" He referenced Apple's Steve Jobs and Virgin's Richard Branson as examples of those who began business as digital hippies. Digital hippies are creating a sharing economy -- one that includes creations like Wikipedia, Airbnb and Lyft -- without a focus on exchanging cash. At Burning Man, Le Meur ""took $500 and came back with $500."" The event, packed full of successful entrepreneurs, changed how he saw the world, Le Meur said. ""It is a little crazy."" Trump: Europe is open for business . Le Meur said the theme may be a bit risky, and he's a ""little scared"" it will scare his sponsors. Although ""Peace, Tech and Love"" seems a good tag, he added. Digital hippies are not the only trend on his radar. The return of hardware is another. In the world of apps, hardware can be unattractive for investors. But Le Meur points to the ability of hardware creations to entirely disrupt supply chains. ""We build websites, then apps, and now we are back to hardware,"" Le Meur said. 3-D printing, for example, could revolutionize the way we buy products. ""You need a knife and fork? You can print it. A glass? You can print it."" Davos, a gathering of the world's elite, could not be further from the idea of digital hippies, but it serves an important role, Le Meur says. ""It is the only place you can meet so many stakeholders. Instead of reading or watching the news you are in the news,"" he says. ""I take out of it a lot of innovation, a lot of ideas, that you can use. But I don't come here with a specific goal. I come here very curious and try to learn.""","LeWeb founder Loic Le Meur is looking to ""digital hippies"" as a potential theme for his next conference .

"(CNN) -- Dates have been an integral part of the culture and identity of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) since ancient times. In the past four decades, production has increased nearly a hundredfold with dates carefully harvested by hand from more than 40 million palm trees across the country. The UAE is currently the world's fifth largest producer of dates, but it's not just homegrown fruit that you will find in the country's souks. Around 250,000 tons are imported every year -- mostly from Saudi Arabia and Iraq -- arriving on wooden dhows at small, traditional ports like Dubai's Al Hamriya. Infographic: Gateway to the Gulf . The old-fashioned sailing vessels remain an integral part of trade in the emirate enabling the fast and efficient transport of dates and other foodstuffs, says Khaldoun Asmar, CEO of Barari Group. ""We have dhows starting from 200 tons up to 2,000 tons,"" says Asmar, whose company handles up to 80,000 tons of dates every year. ""[They] are very strong and fast-moving and can go and come within two, three, four days maximum. So it's easy in terms of moving around. You load fast and you discharge fast,"" Asmar said. ""We export to India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka ... We cover the whole area really and we cover the Middle East, plus we cover Australia, Canada and the U.S."" At Al Hamriya, box after box of dates is unloaded from the dhows onto metal shipping containers which are taken by truck to Dubai's main shipping hub, Jebel Ali Port. ""Jebel Ali is very important to us because it is connected to the world,"" Asmar says. ""We are bringing dates from all over the world, we store it here in Dubai and we re-export again to the rest of the world."" Quiz: Destination Dubai . Dubai is not only a center for re-export, it's a key hub for the whole of the Middle East, says Mohammed Al Muallem, Senior Vice President and Managing Director of DP World. Lots of cargo comes through containers and ends up in warehouses in Dubai, he says, which are then visited by traders from across the region. ""They come and see their products in the warehouses and they basically say, 'I want this to be delivered to a certain areas that don't have ports.' And then what happens is that they use dhows that can go in shallow water to deliver to any location, any area,"" Al Muallem said. All of which makes for a happy mix of old and new, helping Dubai sustain the links with its mercantile past while feeding a global appetite for the region's much-loved traditional fruit.","Dubai's mix of old and new shipping continues to help date trade thrive .

"(CNN) -- A massive winter storm spanning 20 states dumped more than a foot of snow in some places Thursday and brought life to a standstill in parts of the central United States. About 60 million people -- 20% of the U.S. population -- were under winter weather warnings, watches and advisories in the 750,000 square miles affected. Statewide emergency declared . Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency. Snow, sleet and ice could wreak havoc, and parts of the state could see more than 10 inches of snow. Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Sly James also declared a state of emergency. There were 250 snow plows working to clear roads in the city, and residents were urged to limit travel. Kansas City International Airport shut down because of the weather, according to Joe McBride with the city's aviation department. The city picked up 7.6 inches of snow, a record daily snowfall, the National Weather Service said. CNN iReporter Joseph Kopel posted photos of empty shelves in St. Joseph, Missouri, on Wednesday as people stocked up for the blizzard. Authorities in Kansas had closed a 240-mile stretch of Interstate 70 west of Salina earlier in the day. Two dozen soldiers from the Kansas National Guard later searched the interstate and U.S. Highways 54 and 400 farther south for any stranded travelers. In Wichita, despite crews spreading salt and sand across roads for days, many roads remained slick. Side streets were worse, CNN affiliate KSN reported. Gov. Sam Brownback called for people to stay home. ""If you don't have to travel, don't do it,"" the governor said. The storm started to wind down Thursday night in Wichita after leaving 14.2 inches of snow over two days -- the second highest storm total in the city's history, according to the National Weather Service. Topeka received 9.2 inches of snow. The University of Kansas closed two of its campuses -- in Lawrence and Overland Park, both near Kansas City -- through Friday because of the weather. Across the country, flights were canceled or delayed because of weather. St. Louis, Dallas/Fort Worth, Chicago's O'Hare, and Denver had the most cancellations and delays after Kansas City, according to FlightStats, which tracks air travel. United Airlines announced Thursday that certain affected travelers can change their itineraries without paying fees. Track winter weather across the U.S. Some drought relief expected . There is a silver lining for some areas facing the heavy snowfall. ""Big chunks of Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas"" are facing exceptional drought, HLN meteorologist Bob Van Dillen said. ""You squeeze out the water from the melting snow, and you're talking 1 to 2 inches of water for those dry regions."" Wednesday, CNN iReporter Doug Simonton in Tulsa, Oklahoma, posted a photo of a car covered in snow and said numerous traffic accidents had been reported around town. A large system . The storm system is huge and carries with it a warmer, wetter Southern component. It will eventually stretch from the Dakotas to Houston, Myers said. While it will remain snowy in the north, the system was forecast to spawn torrential rains and tornadoes along the Gulf Coast and dump freezing rain over Arkansas and Missouri. Arizona golf tournament suspended because of snow . ""There's going to be a monster ice storm over Springfield and Branson, Missouri. Think of an inch of ice coating everything,"" Myers said. ""Power lines will be coming down. Trees will be coming down."" In St. Louis, freezing rain is predicted to fall on top of a thin layer of snow, which will have ""a significant impact on travel,"" the National Weather Service warned. North of where the most snow will fall, Chicago could receive as much as 6 inches, CNN's Sarah Dillingham said. The city is running 15 inches below its average snowfall for the season. Southern downpours . Severe thunderstorms moving in from the Gulf of Mexico are expected to bring 2 to 6 inches of rain to New Orleans and Montgomery, Alabama, according to CNN's weather center, before rolling up toward Atlanta. The torrential rains could lead to significant river flooding, as flood watches are still in effect from last week's heavy rains. Heavy winds, hail and tornadoes are possible, the National Weather Service said. Downpours are expected to continue into Friday. Desert dwellers stunned . On Wednesday, the winter storm system left a rare thin layer of snow across the deserts of Arizona, New Mexico and southern California as far south as the border with Mexico. ""I've been here for over 10 years and I've never seen it snow like this,"" Kayla Avery of Tucson, Arizona, said in a CNN iReport, which came with a video of the snowfall. ""There is more snow on the ground in Tucson today than I have seen in over 30 years living here,"" Carrie Tucker said in another iReport.

"(CNN) -- Watching the movie ""Lincoln"" on Saturday, Rep. Joe Courtney was perplexed during the climactic scene. Two of his predecessors from nearly 150 years ago, lawmakers representing the state of Connecticut in 1865, are seen voting against the constitutional amendment to end slavery. Courtney asked the Congressional Research Service for the records, and sure enough, all four representatives from Connecticut voted yes on the 13th amendment. But in the film, we see the fictional lawmakers Augustus Benjamin and Arthur Bentleigh of Connecticut each vote ""Nay."" ""I could not believe my own eyes and ears,"" Courtney said. In a letter of protest to director Steven Spielberg, he said that although he thinks overall the film is tremendous and compelling, ""placing the State of Connecticut on the wrong side of the historic and divisive fight over slavery is a distortion of easily verifiable facts."" Screenwriter Tony Kushner conceded the discrepancy but defended the film. ""None of the key moments of that story -- the overarching story our film tells -- are altered,"" he said in a statement Thursday. He explained that the alterations were made to serve the narrative that the outcome of the vote was in doubt until the very end. ""I hope nobody is shocked to learn that I also made up dialogue and imagined encounters and invented characters,"" he added. ""I'm sorry if anyone in Connecticut felt insulted by these 15 seconds of the movie,"" Kushner said, but ""this is a dramatic film and not an attack on their home state."" Still, Courtney said Friday that he hoped the movie would be changed before it is released on DVD on February 26. ""The four members of Connecticut's delegation ... deserved a better legacy than the screenplay portrayed,"" he said. Historian Christian McWhirter, a researcher with the Papers of Abraham Lincoln, supported the congressman's objection. ""It seems like such an unnecessary error,"" he said. Nevertheless, he added, ""it shouldn't overshadow the fact that overall, this is a very strong and accurate portrayal of what actually happened."" Going through the movie script vote by vote, CNN found that the important details are correct. By the narrowest of margins, after a breathless and unpredictable roll call, the amendment passes, with most Republicans in favor but many Democrats opposed. Six of the lawmakers in the film actually existed and cast real votes, while the rest are apparently fictitious. No other vote discrepancies were found in the scene. Columbia University historian Eric Foner said the voting in the film is not the only discrepancy, but for dramatic effect, some poetic license is fine in such a movie. ""It is historical fiction -- a noble genre going back to Shakespeare and well before -- not history,"" he said. Indeed, the movie makes no claims to be a documentary, but is rather a historical film. In the style of a political thriller, it depicts President Lincoln's efforts to get a ban on slavery passed in Washington, using a combination of persuasion, inspiration, horse-trading and arm-twisting. The film has been nominated for 12 Academy Awards and has been a success both with the critics and at the box office. Disney, the distributor, and representatives for Spielberg did not reply to inquiries from CNN on Wednesday. McWhirter defended the movie. "" 'Lincoln' is an exceptionally good Hollywood historical film,"" he said, ""so I think we have to have a certain amount of tolerance for a certain amount of error."" CNN's JD Cargill contributed to this report.","NEW: Screenwriter defends film, says no key moments of the story were altered .

"(CNN) -- Two brothers and two of their uncles are among nine people indicted on allegations of distributing cocaine to Italy and trafficking within the United States the same drug as well as methamphetamine, federal prosecutors in California announced Wednesday. The drug-trafficking ring also allegedly laundered money through the Dominican Republic, authorities said. One brother, Rafael Urena, 27, of Rancho Cucamonga, California, was arrested Wednesday morning, but his brother Milton, 29, of the Dominican Republic, is still being sought by authorities, according to a statement by the office U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. in Los Angeles. An uncle, Francisco Javier Vargas-Oseguera, 51, was already in federal custody in Seattle, Washington, facing a federal charge of allegedly possessing eight pounds of methamphetamine in an unrelated case, authorities said. Another uncle, Leonel Urena-Partida, 49, of Guadalajara, Mexico, is accused of conspiring to transport cocaine to Italy and is being sought by authorities, the prosecutor's office said. Federal authorities used undercover agents and wiretaps intercepting phone calls, text messages and communications through BlackBerry Messenger, the prosecutor's office said. The probe seized about 40 kilograms, or 88 pounds, of cocaine being smuggled into Italy from the Dominican Republic and Mexico, authorities said. The investigation also uncovered the distribution of cocaine and methamphetamine throughout the United States through the use of vehicles with hidden compartments, authorities said. Authorities accuse members of the drug-trafficking ring of laundering drug money from the Dominican Republic to Fontana, California, and Rancho Cucamonga by means of Western Union wire transfers. The indictment accuses eight defendants -- including the two brothers and two uncles -- of conspiracy to distribute cocaine to Italy and accuses the four relatives and two more defendants of conspiracy of domestic distribution of cocaine and methamphetamine, authorities said. The indictment also accuses ""various defendants"" of the distribution of approximately one pound of methamphetamine, three counts of use of a communication facility in committing a felony drug offense, and conspiracy to launder money, the prosecutor's office said.","One brother is arrested, but the other is still being sought .

"(CNN) -- You probably know him best from season 11 of ""The Biggest Loser."" But trainer Brett Hoebel is more than just a temporary Jillian Michaels replacement. The martial arts expert has a background in biomedical science and uses his knowledge of Western and Eastern fitness disciplines to train celebrities from Victoria's Secret supermodels Karolina Kurkova and Doutzen Kroes to rap artist Q-Tip. When he's not sweating with A-listers, Hoebel is traveling abroad to teach his favorite workout, capoeira. This mix of martial arts and dance was created by slaves in Brazil and uses participants' body weight to tone and strengthen. ""It's different -- that's why I like it,"" Hoebel says. ""You know, it's like I can out-swagger in capoeira. Having swagger lifting? Uh, kind of. But I can really put my signature and personality and my stance on my capoeira. You're going to know you're doing it with Brett."" Hoebel's also a judge on the online reality show ""Fit or Flop,"" where contestants compete to be the next big celebrity fitness trainer. He took a break on set to speak with CNN about the show, the art of motivation and our biggest nutrition downfall. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: Why did you join ""Fit or Flop""? Brett Hoebel: I think the fitness industry needs something like this. I think this is a great way to motivate (new trainers) and get them inspired and actually learn how to better themselves, not only as a personality but also as a business and a marketable commodity. Truck driver dances off 97 pounds . CNN: Is there anything on the show that you've really been shocked by or impressed by? Hoebel: Definitely shocked. I think there's definitely been more newbies coming in that really have no clue about what they have to offer. What we're judging is on five categories: the concept, marketability, user base, personality and star power. And a lot of people come in and do not have a concept. They don't have any idea what the brand is, or they don't have a name chosen out for it. That, to me, is pretty shocking. If you're going to step up in the auditioning process for a show like this and want to get chosen as the next fitness star with a $150,000 grand prize, you've got to really come in with a clear (idea). So it's been a little frustrating. CNN: World Health Day is April 7, and the theme this year is hypertension. What can people do to prevent high blood pressure? Hoebel: Foods that are high in sodium or salt are some of the things that you really have to control. Anything that's packaged, especially meats, are generally going to be higher in sodium. So you really should try to eat fresh foods. It may take a little more time to prepare the foods, but you're guaranteed to have a lot less sodium. I generally, with my clients, try to stick under 1,000 (milligrams) a day. If you look at some ingredients, let's say on a ramen noodle thing, it's got 1,000 (milligrams) just in one serving. So you've got to read food labels. Something that a lot of people don't realize too is (that) sugar can retain a lot of water in the body, and that can affect your blood pressure. Worst fast-food meals for sodium . CNN: What are some of the biggest traps for sodium? Hoebel: If you really want to be low-sodium, you have to prepare your food. Salt is one of the flavors that makes food taste good -- salt, sugar and fat. So it's a natural thing for all chefs and cooks to add salt, because it enhances the flavor of the food. If you go out to eat, I guarantee you're going to be eating a lot of salted foods that you are going to have no idea. How are you going to read a food label on a plate of food that's handed to you at a diner? You can't. The new restaurant fat traps . CNN: You were all about tough love on ""The Biggest Loser."" Is that still your style? Hoebel: Put it this way: I think when it comes to love, you've got to give love and you gotta give tough love. So my philosophy is if somebody does a great job, you have to commend them, give them a fist bump, congratulate them. They gave you a good effort and it's positive reinforcement. But if they're slacking, I am definitely going to call them out on it. I'm going to be their accountability, in their ear until they stop doing it. CNN: High-intensity interval training is all the rage. What is it about HIIT sessions that really work? Hoebel: When you do these types of intense workouts, they cause a big metabolic disturbance in your body. Think of race car driving -- there's the normal race car and then they have the little nitrous oxide switch that turns on the turbo. You don't need (the turbo) when you're taking, like, a Zumba class. But now think about doing sprints on a hill. You cannot do those for an hour like you can in a Zumba class because the intensity is too high. You're not doing aerobic training, you're doing anaerobic training. In anaerobic training, the body tends to have to call on the nitrous oxide because the intensity is so hard it needs the extra boost. (That) causes a big disturbance in the system. As a result, when you're trying to get your metabolism back to normal, it doesn't happen for free. It takes energy to do that, and it takes calories. And that's what you want. You want to be burning calories after you work out. The problem becomes for most people -- it's not pleasant, it's painful. You have to have the pain tolerance to be able to deal with that, which a lot of people do not. CNN: What's the biggest weight loss or fitness obstacle you see people encounter? Hoebel: Really, No. 1 is diet. Most people want to think it's a fitness thing or a nutrition regimen, and I'm like, it's a mental and emotional thing. We are in a society where we're exposed to food so much of the time, and what people don't realize is that food is a drug. Chemicals make up drugs; chemicals make up food. Food is the most over-prescribed drug we have today. Food is a lot of people's therapy -- when we say comfort food, we really mean that. It's releasing dopamine and serotonin in your brain that makes you feel good. And as you (indulge) more and more and more, it can become a little bit addictive. After you do that for too long, it can no longer be a choice -- you really change the physical structure of your brain and it's going to be harder to quit. (But) the food addiction is only part of it. The emotional issues are the deeper thing, and if you don't fix that, it's just not going to work. Journaling helps woman lose half her body weight . CNN: How do you get clients over mental barriers? Hoebel: I think what I try to do with everyone is build self-confidence and accountability. You want people to be self-motivating, in a sense. If you can build accountability and confidence in people, the little switch will go on inside of them. They're going to show up on time. Their diet is going to change.

"Paris (CNN) -- The French Senate opened debate Thursday on a controversial bill that would extend the right to marry and adopt to same-sex couples. The lower house has already approved the legislation. If it passes the Senate, it would mark the biggest step forward for French gay rights advocates in more than a decade. But the plan faces stiff opposition from the Roman Catholic Church, other religious groups and social conservatives, with huge numbers turning out for protest marches in Paris in recent weeks. At the same time, the legislation has won wide backing from gay rights advocates. The Senate debate is expected to continue into next week. Same-sex marriage: Who will legalize it next? International question . France is not the only nation currently wrestling with the polarizing issue. Uruguayan senators voted overwhelmingly in favor of a same-sex marriage measure Tuesday, despite vocal opposition from the Catholic Church. Next week, lawmakers in the lower house are expected to vote on the Senate's version. Legislators in the United Kingdom are also weighing proposals to legalize same-sex marriage. In the United States, the issue went before the Supreme Court last week, and justices are now deliberating over the matter. Nine states and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, including three states -- Maryland, Washington, and Maine -- where voters approved it in ballot initiatives last year. The other 41 states have specific laws blocking gays and lesbians from legally marrying. The first same-sex couples walked down the aisle in the Netherlands in 2001. Since then, almost a dozen countries have passed laws allowing same-sex marriages and domestic partnerships, including Canada, South Africa, Belgium and Spain. In Argentina, the push to legalize same-sex marriage met with fierce opposition from the Roman Catholic Church, with Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio -- then the archbishop of Buenos Aires and now the pope -- engaging in a notorious war of words with the government over the issue. It was approved in 2010. The issue also has divided Australia, where lawmakers voted against a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last September. A poll for the advocacy group Australian Marriage Equality indicated that 64% of those surveyed ""support marriage equality."" 'It's love that matters' Extending the right to marry and adopt to same-sex couples in France was one of President Francois Hollande's electoral pledges in campaigning last year. The left, which includes Hollande's governing Socialist Party, dominates the National Assembly, where the bill passed by a large majority in February. The party has only a slim majority in the Senate. The issue has sparked strong reactions among ordinary voters, as well as their legislators. Some 300,000 people turned out for a protest march staged less than two weeks ago, police in Paris told CNN affiliate BFM-TV. Same-sex marriage campaigner Marc Barronet told CNN it was not surprising that the move has provoked strong reactions from some. ""France is a rather progressive country ... but you shouldn't forget that France also has some parts of rather conservative society and in times of economic crisis, people tend to cling to what they know and fear change, forgetting sometimes that change can bring improvements."" Opinion: Gay rights in France - How even the U.S. leads the way . Nonetheless, he is confident that the measure will pass sooner rather than later. ""France is a secular society, so it's very different from other countries where religion plays a large part in the question of marriage,"" he said. ""There is a clear majority in parliament in favor of this bill, so it will become law."" Engineer Driss Houat, 69, told CNN Thursday he opposes the measure. ""I am completely against it because God created man and woman so that they could be married. Not for anything else. It's absurd for me to see this bill pass,"" he said. But Myriam Duru, 37, a manager at a Tommy Hilfiger store, disagrees. ""I am Muslim, so I believe in God. I think it's not a problem for me to accept. I don't understand people who think that God exists and can say 'I'm against the happiness of people,'"" she said. Alexis Nys, a 58-year-old salesman, said he supports same-sex marriage ""because at the end it's love that matters. Not old things and old fashions. I think we need to live like we should live today."" A law legalizing civil unions was introduced in 1999 in France under a previous Socialist government. Known in France as the PACS (pacte civil de solidarite), the civil union agreement can be entered into by same-sex or straight couples and confers many but not all of the rights of marriage.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The patter of rockets from Gaza into Israel continued Wednesday, according to Israeli authorities. And an al-Qaeda linked group claimed responsibility for launches that occurred a day earlier. The steady drip of projectiles has irked the Jewish state, which Tuesday conducted its first airstrikes into the Palestinian territory since the cease-fire that ended eight days of raging hostilities in November. Two explosions outside of an Israeli city near Gaza led police bomb disposal experts on a search for new rockets Wednesday, said spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. ""We found one rocket that landed in the entrance of Sderot without causing injury, no damage. Luckily it fell in an open area."" Explosives engineers are still looking for a second one, he said. ""It is the second wave of rockets in the last 24 hours. One rocket was fired yesterday and landed in the Eshkol Region."" Israel Defense Forces said war planes accurately struck two terror targets in Gaza on Tuesday, but Palestinian security officials said the strike hit empty land, causing no injuries. The majority of rockets launched from Gaza lack precision and nose-dive into open areas in Israel. Defense minister Moshe Ya'alon lashed out at Hamas, blaming the Islamist party that governs Gaza for the rocket fire and justifying Israel's military action. ""We will not let any fire drip down on our civilians or forces,"" he said. Obama: 'Peace is possible' Small groups claim responsibility . Hamas has denied any connection to recent rocket strikes. The al-Qaeda affiliated Mojahideen Shura claimed responsibility for firing two rockets at the Eshkol region Tuesday, saying it was retaliation for the death of a prominent Palestinian prisoner who died the same day in Israeli custody. Retired Palestinian general Maysara Abu Hamdiya died of cancer at age 64 after being transferred from prison to an Israeli hospital. He had been incarcerated since 2002 in connection with the bombing of a Jerusalem cafe. His death triggered outrage among Palestinians, who accuse Israel of denying him treatment. 4,500 fellow inmates have gone on a three day hunger strike to protest his passing, according to a Palestinian prisoners' association. Ya'alon stressed that there was no relation between Israel's actions in Gaza and Abu Hamdiya's death. Hamas has said a group called Khalid Ibn Al-waleed claimed responsibility for other recent launches at Israel, and that it has no connection to Hamas. Rockets from Gaza hit Israeli city during Obama visit . Dust up with Syria . Ya'alon also vented anger at the Syrian government in Damascus, holding it responsible for an alleged attack in the Israeli held Golan Heights, an area Syria claims as its own. ""As far as we are concerned, the regime in Syria is responsible for everything that is happening in its territory and will not allow fire to fall on Israeli territory without reaction,"" he said. Ya'alon said the defense forces destroyed the source of the alleged attack overnight. READ RELATED: Israel conducts first airstrikes in Gaza since November, sources say .

"(CNN) -- A French appeals court on Thursday cleared Continental Airlines of criminal responsibility for the Air France Concorde crash that killed 113 people in 2000, but affirmed a civil judgment against the U.S. carrier. Continental, which has since merged with United Airlines, had appealed a 2010 ruling that blamed the company and one of its mechanics for the crash of Flight 4590 shortly after takeoff from Paris. Beyond Concorde: The next generation of supersonic flight . The appeals court upheld the findings of a lower court -- that a strip of metal that fell off a Continental jet was responsible for a chain of events that led to the crash. But the appeals court said a criminal conviction was not justified, CNN affiliate BFM-TV reported. But because the appeals court agreed with the findings of what led to the crash, the U.S. airline must still pay more than $1.2 million (1 million euros) to Air France as ordered by the lower court, BFM-TV reported. Read more: Continental Airlines and mechanic guilty in deadly Concorde crash . Air France has paid an unspecified sum in damages to the families of most of the victims of the only Concorde crash. An investigation revealed that the Concorde jet struck a small strip of titanium and blew a tire during takeoff from Charles de Gaulle airport on July 25, 2000. The blown tire scattered debris into the left wing and ruptured the fuel tank. The supersonic jet burst into flames and crashed into a hotel, killing 100 passengers, nine crew and four people on the ground. The titanium strip allegedly fell off a Continental DC-10 which took off just before the Concorde. Judicial investigators said the strip was improperly installed on the DC-10 engine, prompting the charges against Continental. Air France and British Airways stopped Concorde service in 2003 because the flights did not make money.","French appeals ruling upholds lower court decision in Concorde case .

"(CNN) -- There used to be a bookstore -- I think it was the late Gotham Book Mart on 46th Street -- where you'd find a yellowing map of Woody Allen's New York: a listing of the locations the writer and director had made famous in such films as ""Annie Hall,"" ""Manhattan"" and ""Hannah and Her Sisters."" That was the thing about Woody -- the map didn't have to venture far from the five boroughs. (Or, frankly, from what another Woody -- Guthrie -- called ""the New York island."") Starting sometime in the late '80s, Allen started expanding his geographical footprint considerably. Well, at least to Europe. His new film, ""To Rome With Love,"" is set in -- you guessed it -- Rome. It opens in the U.S. on June 22. It's already opened in Italy, where it took in $3.7 million its opening weekend and was the country's No. 1 grossing film, beating even the crowd-pleasing ""Battleship."" Allen's latest follows a sequence of films set in London, Barcelona and Paris. What does Woody see in these cultural capitals? Take a tour with the bespectacled filmmaker and the fine reference site www.movie-locations.com and find out. The London of ""Match Point"" (2005) ""Match Point,"" a Hitchcockian crime drama that followed a series of middling comedies (""Small Time Crooks,"" ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion,"" ""Anything Else"") was intended for Allen's native New York but moved to London for the most practical of reasons: That's where the financing was. Nevertheless, Allen made the most of the trip, and it shows in the settings. The film, about social-climbing tennis player Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and his fraught affair with American actress Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), makes the city, at times, look as lush as Allen's Manhattan -- no small trick. Photos: London landmarks . Visit: The Tate Modern (Bankside, London SE1). The famed art museum is housed in an old power station. Among the works on display are Duchamp's ""Fountain,"" Damien Hirst's ""Pharmacy"" and Rothko's ""Red on Maroon."" It's where Rhys-Meyers' and Johansson's characters meet after the former is married. View: The Gherkin (30 St Mary Axe, London EC3A). Perhaps the most famous of London's recent wave of American-style skyscrapers, architect Norman Foster's tube-like high-rise is the site of Wilton's post-tennis job. Shop in: Mayfair (London W1). If you can afford it, Mayfair is London's luxury shopping and residential district, home to the custom tailors of Savile Row (the street where the Beatles once made their headquarters), the jewelers of Bond Street and what's soon to be the former American embassy at Grosvenor Square. At the least, have a drink. That's what Wilton and Rice do. The Paris of ""Midnight in Paris"" (2011) Allen's whimsical tale of an American writer (Owen Wilson) in the City of Light is his most successful box office hit. It also won Allen his fourth Oscar. In the film, Wilson's Gil, a troubled screenwriter trying to write a novel, longs for the Paris of the '20s, a period he sees as a golden era. He learns that nostalgia is in the mind of the beholder, but he certainly sees the city at its most dazzling. Photos: City of Light -- and love . Visit: Musée Rodin (79 Rue de Varenne, 7ème). Dedicated to Auguste Rodin, the sculptor of ""The Thinker"" and ""The Kiss,"" the Musée Rodin features a gorgeous garden behind an 18th-century hotel where Rodin worked the last years of his life. In the movie, Gil bickers with the guide over events in Rodin's life as the group strolls through the grounds. View: St. Etienne du Mont (Place Sainte-Geneviève, 5ème). It's here, near the steps of this 15th-century church, that Gil is strolling when the mysterious car pulls up and takes him back to the 1920s. Also worth a look: the area around Sacre Coeur in Montmartre (18ème), the highest point in Paris, full of beautiful vistas and steep stairways, where Gil finds himself late in the film. Shop in: Shakespeare and Co. (37 Rue de la Bûcherie, 5ème). The original Shakespeare and Co., a bookstore that opened in 1919, was a regular stop for American and British expatriates. The current shop dates from 1951 and was named after the first bookstore in 1964. The location on the Left Bank is close by the Petit Pont, which connects the Left Bank with the Île de la Cité, home of Notre Dame. The Barcelona of ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" (2008) This romantic comedy, which starred Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall as two American students who get mixed up with a Spanish artist (Javier Bardem) and his mentally unbalanced ex-wife (Penelope Cruz), won a Golden Globe for best musical or comedy film. Cruz won an Oscar for best supporting actress. Visit: Tibidabo Amusement Park (71 Carretera de Vallvidrera al Tibidabo). The century-old amusement park, located on a mountain overlooking the city, was where Vicky, Cristina and their boyfriends spent an afternoon. Don't want to go to an amusement park? There's always Park Güell, the turn-of-the-century hilltop development created by Antonio Gaudi, or La Sagrada Familia (401 Calle Mallorca), Gaudi's amazing church, which has been under construction for more than 100 years. Photos: Soaking up Spain . View: Peix d'Or (1 Carrer de la Marina). Architect Frank Gehry's giant fish was commissioned for the 1992 Olympics. The Port Olimpic area was built up for the Games and was the site of scenes featuring Vicky and Cristina. Shop in: Las Ramblas. The famed promenade may be less than a mile long, but it's the place to be for people watching, window shopping and taking in some of Barcelona's most notable attractions, including the city's opera house and the Font de Canaletes. Allen's protagonists certainly took advantage, shooting photographs and making assignations. The Rome of ""To Rome With Love"" (2012) OK, so the film is barely out, but based on the trailer and the cast, this looks like one of Allen's episodic turns -- there's an older couple (Allen and Judy Davis), a set of confused young adults (Jesse Eisenberg, Greta Gerwig, Ellen Page) and a couple of Europeans adding color (Roberto Benigni, Penelope Cruz). The local press has criticized it for presenting a tourist's view of the city, but moviegoers might not be so put off. Visit: The Trevi Fountain (Piazza de Trevi, near the intersection of Via della Stamperia and Via delle Muratte). Allen's characters would be remiss if they didn't drop a coin in the Trevi, the ornate watering hole that was completed in 1762, though its origins date back to the Roman Empire. The fountain has been featured in ""Roman Holiday"" and ""Three Coins in the Fountain,"" the latter of which pays tribute to the legend that a person who throws a coin in the fountain is destined to return to Rome. Photos: iReporters in Italy . View: Rome was built on seven hills, so there's plenty of spectacular views. One of the best is from the Cupola of St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. You can take an elevator to the top, but climbing the 320 steps is well worth it. (Be sure to dress properly, though: no shorts or miniskirts.) The Sistine Chapel, where Cruz's character cracks a lewd joke, is a short walk. Shop in: Piazza Spagna (1 Piazza di Spagna and surrounding area). Allen may not be a fashion plate, but his upscale characters would certainly want to take advantage of the best Italian clothiers -- and it's here, at the Spanish Steps, that many of them have their flagship stores. What if Europe isn't in your plans? Don't worry. There's always Manhattan, where the vast majority of Allen's 40-plus films have been made. And if you want to really get off the map, take a trip to the Republic of San Marcos. Just remember: Change your underwear every half-hour, and please wear it on the outside so authorities can check.","A handful of Woody Allen's recent films have featured great European cities .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Green Day canceled the rest of its North American club tour dates for this year and has postponed all January and February shows to give lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong more time to deal with substance abuse issues, the rock band said Monday. ""Obviously the timing for this isn't ideal, but Billie Joe's well-being is our main concern,"" bass player Mike Dirnt said. Armstrong, who sought treatment for substance abuse two days after his expletive-laden meltdown during a show in Las Vegas in September, ""is doing well,"" Dirnt said. When the band announced on September 23 that its charismatic frontman would get help for substance abuse, it did not specify the nature of his problems. The 2012 club tour was set to launch on November 26 in Seattle's Paramount Theatre and end in Tempe, Arizona, on December 10. The shows, which also included stops in California, Oregon and Nevada, will not be rescheduled. The 21-city tour that was scheduled to start on January 7 in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and conclude on February 8 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas will be rescheduled, the group's announcement said. It was in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand that Armstrong's infamous onstage meltdown happened, during the iHeartRadio Music Festival. Video from the event, captured on YouTube, shows Armstrong cursing profusely after cutting a song short. He then went on a profanity-filled rant, pointing to a sign indicating Green Day had only one minute left in its set, far shorter than he'd expected. ""You've got to be ... kidding me,"" said Armstrong, noting his longevity on the music scene and disparaging teen pop sensation Justin Bieber, who was not among the festival performers. ""This is a ... joke."" Armstrong then slammed his guitar onto the stage, shredding it, and tossed its remnants into the crowd. He then flashed his middle finger and walked off the stage. The band later issued an apology, telling fans ""that our set was not cut short by Clear Channel and to apologize to those we offended at the iHeartRadio Festival in Las Vegas."" iHeartRadio is a division of Clear Channel Broadcasting. While fans can't see Green Day live onstage anytime soon, the group is moving up the release date of the album ""Green Day Tre!"" to December 11, 2012, from its original date of January 15, 2013. ""We feel bad we have to delay our tour, so to make up for it we want to give our fans the music earlier than we had planned,"" drummer Tre Cool said. ""If we couldn't be there to play it for you live, the least we could do was give you the next best thing."" Armstrong was rushed to a hospital in Italy in September ""due to illness,"" Dirnt said then in a video posted on the band's website. After forming in 1987, the veteran punk band broke through in 1994 with the release of ""Dookie,"" which sold 15 million copies and earned the band a Grammy for best alternative music performance. Green Day continued to produce hit albums, like ""Insomniac,"" ""Nimrod"" and ""Warning."" In 2004, the band took another major step forward with the release of ""American Idiot,"" which won a Grammy for best rock album and inspired a ""rock opera"" years later by the same name. The rockers have remained relevant in subsequent years, including capturing yet another Grammy in 2009 for the politically charged album ""21st Century Breakdown.""

"(CNN) -- In response to an Air Force colonel's overturned sexual assault conviction, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is asking Congress to limit military commanders' authority to toss out court-martial verdicts. ""These changes would increase the confidence of service members and the public that the military justice system will do justice in every case,"" Hagel said in a statement Monday announcing the initiative. Hagel also wants to require commanders who change court-martial sentences to explain their decisions in writing. The effort comes in response to the case of Air Force Col. James Wilkerson. The F-16 pilot was freed last year from a Navy brig four months after a court-martial convicted him of sexually assaulting a woman at his home outside Aviano Air Base in Italy. Acting under the military justice system's Article 60, the Air Force's top commanding officer in Europe, Lt. Gen. Craig Franklin, exercised his power as ""convening authority"" of the court-martial to overturn the conviction. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was among those expressing outrage over the decision. ""As we are trying to send a signal to women ... I question now whether that unit that that man returns to, whether there's any chance a woman who is sexually assaulted in that unit would ever say a word,"" McCaskill said during a hearing in March. Lisa Windsor, a former Army Judge Advocate General officer, said any base commander has authority to do what Franklin did, but ""I've actually never seen that happen before, that a convening authority would completely overturn the case."" Hagel ordered a review of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and Monday's announcement is the result. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and secretaries of the various services support the changes, he said. ""Despite the attention and efforts of senior leaders throughout the Department of Defense, it is clear the department still has much more work to do to fully address the problem of sexual assault in the ranks,"" Hagel said. ""This crime is damaging this institution. There are thousands of victims in the department, male and female, whose lives and careers have been upended, and that is unacceptable."" About 19,000 men and women suffer sexual assault each year in the military, former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said last year in announcing a Pentagon effort to stop the crime. Panetta noted that only about 3,200 of those assaults were reported. About 10,700 cases -- 56% -- involved male victims in 2010, based on anonymous reporting collected by the military.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A federal government advisory committee voted Tuesday to recommend that males ages 11 to 21 be vaccinated against the human papilloma virus, which is blamed for thousands of cases of cancer among women and men. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices said the vaccine series can be started as early as age 9. Twelve members of the committee voted in favor of a recommendation that 11- and 12-year-old boys be vaccinated; one member abstained. In a separate vote involving males age 13 to 21, eight voted in favor; five against, and one abstained. The same recommendation said men ages 22 through 26 may be vaccinated. Much of the debate focused on whether it would be cost-effective to vaccinate boys against HPV. The vaccine is administered over a six-month period in three doses, each of which costs about $120. Dr. S. Michael March, clinical professor of pediatrics at the University of Southern California and a member of the group that devised the recommendations, said the cost to vaccinate 11- and 12-year-old boys would be $38 million. ""We have the money, we just have to set the priorities,"" he said. ""If we don't, I don't know who will."" HPV is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States. At least half of sexually active people will get it at some point in their lives. Why vaccinate middle schoolers? Experts say that it's important to immunize people before they become sexually active. According to the Guttmacher Institute, which studies sexual health, 13% of 15-year-olds have had vaginal sex. By 19, that figure has risen to 70%. The vaccine is less effective after a person is sexually active. Study: Males should get HPV vaccine too . The HPV votes took place as part of the advisory committee's meeting in Atlanta. The vaccine is 89% effective against genital warts in males and 75% effective against anal cancer in males, according to CDC. The HPV vaccine is already recommended for females between the ages of 9 and 26 to reduce the risk of cervical cancer. The CDC recommends girls also get the vaccine at age 11 or 12. The Food and Drug Administration approved the first HPV vaccine, Gardasil, in 2006. A second vaccine, Cervarix, was approved in 2009. Gardasil protects against most genital warts and anal, vaginal and vulvar cancers, all of which are associated with HPV, according to the disease agency. Although the vaccine has been approved for males since 2009, it hasn't been as heavily promoted for them. Increase in oral cancers linked to HPV . One reason for the push now is that girls aren't getting vaccinated in the numbers doctors had expected. ""If the boys are also immunized, it reduces the transmission back and forth,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University, who attended the CDC meeting as an adviser but not a voting member. In addition, the committee voted to recommend that men who have sex with men up to age 26 be vaccinated against HPV because that would protect them from cancers of the penis and rectum. There also is growing evidence that HPV is responsible for a recent increase in head and neck cancer. A study published this month found approximately 70% of all oropharyngeal cancers are caused by HPV. Oropharyngeal cancers are those that form in the middle of the throat behind the mouth, an area that includes the back third of the tongue, the soft palate, the side and back walls of the throat and the tonsils. This year, the American Academy of Pediatrics added the HPV vaccine to its list of recommended vaccines for boys. A new study suggests that HPV may also be linked to cardiovascular disease. Researchers from the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston studied 2,450 women ages 20 to 59 who had participated in a national survey from 2003 to 2006 and found that 1,141 women tested positive for HPV. Of them, 573 had cancer-associated HPV types. Those whose who tested positive for HPV were 2.3 times more likely to have said they suffered a stroke or heart attack, the authors found. That odds ratio went up to 2.86 when women with cancer-associated HPV types were compared with women who had no such infections, according to the study, which was published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. ""Nearly 20% of individuals with CVD (cardiovascular disease) do not show any risk factors, indicating that other 'nontraditional' causes may be involved in the development of the disease; HPV appears to be one such factor among women,"" Dr. Ken Fujise, the lead author of the study and director of the division of cardiology at the University of Texas said in a news release. ""This has important clinical implications. First, the HPV vaccine may also help prevent heart disease. Second, physicians should monitor patients with cancer-associated HPV to prevent heart attack and stroke, as well as HPV patients already diagnosed with CVD to avoid future cardiovascular events."" But an accompanying editorial, by Dr. Joseph B. Muhlestein, a cardiologist at Intermountain Medical Center in Murray, Utah, pointed out weaknesses in the study that make it difficult to point to a causal effect. He noted the small number of infected patients, their relative youth, the fact that it depended on their recall of their history and the fact that no adjustment was made for their socioeconomic status. He called for further work to be done. The results ""may just apply to a certain subset of people with genetic early atherosclerosis,"" said Dr. Joseph Ricotta, director of clinical research at the Division of Vascular Surgery and Endovascular Therapy at Emory University in Atlanta. ""Not every person who has HPV is going to get cancer, it may be that only those kinds that have a link to cancer will have a link to cardiovascular disease,"" said Ricotta, who also called for further studies before reaching ""hard and fast"" conclusions. The HPV vaccine became a political hot potato when Republican presidential contender Michele Bachmann criticized fellow Republican contender and Texas Gov. Rick Perry's support of the vaccine for girls. In 2007, he signed an executive order that required Texas schoolgirls to receive vaccinations against HPV. The order ended up not being implemented. The CDC notes that the FDA has licensed the vaccines as safe and effective. ""Both vaccines were tested in thousands of people around the world. These studies showed no serious safety concerns. Common, mild adverse events reported during these studies include pain where the shot was given, fever, dizziness, and nausea,"" according to the CDC website. CNN's Aaron Cooper, Trisha Henry, William Hudson and Saundra Young contributed to this report.","CDC: Tests on thousands of people show ""no serious safety concerns""

"(CNN) -- The capture of the surviving Boston Marathon bombing suspect last Friday ended the city's nightmare. But for investigators, a huge task lies ahead. They ""have a million questions, and those questions need to be answered,"" Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said over the weekend. Those answers could help authorities explain why two brothers might have done this and how the terrorist attack could have been prevented. Here is a look at five of the burning questions vexing investigators: . 1. Did the suspects act alone? Preliminary interviews with surviving suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev suggest that he and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, were self-radicalized jihadists, not members of a terrorist group, a U.S. government source said. Hospitalized since his capture on Friday and unable to speak, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is communicating with investigators by writing and nodding. Tsarnaev has indicated that his older brother, not any international terrorist group, directed last week's deadly attack in Boston, the government source said. He has conveyed that Tamerlan Tsarnaev's motivation stemmed from jihadist thought and the idea that Islam is under attack, so jihadists need to fight back, the source said Monday. Authorities might never have all the answers about Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, who died after an encounter with police early Friday. Nevertheless, the possibility that the Tsarnaev brothers were members of a terrorist group has not been ruled out. The government source cautioned that the interviews were preliminary, and that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's account needs to be checked out and followed up on by investigators. As CNN's national security analyst Peter Bergen points out, the brothers' e-mail traffic will be of huge interest to investigators as they seek an answer to this question. And even if the suspected Boston bombers were not connected to a terrorist organization, the brothers may have had help. 2. What was Tamerlan Tsarnaev doing in Russia? The older brother's six-month trip to Russia during the first half of 2012 is also a focal point of the probe. His father has said that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was with him at all times during that trip. But investigators are not ruling out that he could have met up with some nefarious characters during that visit to Makhachkala, the capital of Russia's Dagestan republic, where his father still lives today. ""What I'm very concerned about is that when he went over there, he very well may have been radicalized and trained by these Chechen rebels, who are the fiercest jihad warriors,"" said Rep. Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas who is chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. The trip came after the suspect, an accomplished boxer, became increasingly religious, his aunt said. After returning from the trip, Tamerlan Tsarnaev started a YouTube channel with links to various videos. Two were posted under a category labeled ""terrorists,"" but later deleted. It's not clear by whom. A CNN analysis of the YouTube channel determined one deleted video featured a militant named Abu Dujana, whose real name was Gadzhimurad Dolgatov. Russian security services killed Dolgatov in December during an assault on an apartment in Makhachkala. The investigation also will look into whether Tamerlan Tsarnaev made other trips to the northern Caucasus region, McCaul said Sunday. A look at Tamerlan Tsarnaev's past . 3. How did Dzhokhar Tsarnaev go from 'lovely kid' to suspected terrorist? After the FBI named the two suspects on Thursday night, many who knew the brothers expressed disbelief -- particularly friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. He was ""a lovely, lovely kid,"" said Larry Aaronson, a former teacher at the younger Tsarnaev's high school. Aaronson described the young man as compassionate, caring, and jovial. Ruslan Tsarni, the boys' uncle -- who made headlines for calling the boys ""losers"" -- said he believes Tamerlan Tsarnaev influenced his younger brother. Investigators are looking into whether that was the case. Some acquaintances of the boys believe Dzhokhar Tsarnaev may have been brainwashed by his brother. ""All I can say is I think his brother put him up to it,"" said Peter Tenzin, who co-captained the high school wrestling team with Dzhokhar. ""There's no way in heck that he would do it. Mentally, he's just not that kind of guy."" Uncle: Cambridge friend 'brainwashed him completely' 4. Why wasn't the FBI tracking Tamerlan? Acting on Russia's concerns that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was a follower of radical Islam, FBI agents interviewed the older brother in 2011, an FBI official said. But the Russian government's request was vague and the lack of specifics limited how much the FBI was able to investigate Tsarnaev, according to a U.S. official and a law enforcement source. Nevertheless, many are wondering why this young man seemingly dropped off the FBI's radar in the years since, particularly after his six-month trip to Russia's unstable North Caucasus region. ""This man was pointed out by a foreign government to be dangerous. He was interviewed by the FBI once ... then, he went to Russia. ... Why wasn't he interviewed when he came back either at the airport when he was returning or later?"" Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York said to CNN. FBI takes heat over Boston bombing suspect . Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham also voiced concern about the FBI's handling of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, but the senator from South Carolina pulled back his criticism on Monday, saying that the problem might have been partly the result of Tsarnaev's misspelled name on a travel document. Many lawmakers are asking whether the FBI should have done more. ""I think there's going to be an awful lot of questions about this, that's going to be looked at over the coming months and maybe longer than that,"" said Rep. Michael Capuano, a Massachusetts Democrat. ""Like every situation, I have faith that the FBI and other agencies have done their job. Can they improve their job going forward? Absolutely."" 5. Why was an MIT police officer killed? This is another missing piece of the puzzle. Police don't know why Sean Collier, a young MIT campus police officer, was killed -- allegedly by the Tsarnaev brothers. Collier was inside his police vehicle Thursday night after responding to a loud disturbance call when he was shot and killed on the MIT campus, according to Watertown Police Chief Edward Duveau. ""It appears that the suspects approached from the rear... and then fired four to five shots into the cruiser,"" Cambridge Police Commissioner Robert Haas said on ""CNN Newsroom"" Monday. A short time after the MIT shooting, the suspects are believed to have carjacked an SUV about a mile away. Later, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a police confrontation. The motive for Collier's killing is unknown, Haas said. ""We really have no idea at this point in time.""","The capture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev last week ended Boston's nightmare .
Yet, investigators must answer ""a million questions""
There is still no clear motive for last week's bombings .

"New York (CNN) -- Some families of 9/11 victims are outraged over the National September 11 Memorial Museum's decision to charge admission for visitors. Sally Regenhard, assistant chairwoman of the group 9/11 Parents and Families of Firefighters and WTC Victims, called the fee a ""slap in the face"" on Sunday. ""Patriotic people from all corners of the country go to teach their children something and show respect, and now they will be faced with this fee? It is outrageous,"" she said. ""This feeds the idea of New York City being money-hungry. It is taking advantage of tourists,"" Regenhard said. ""Making people pay to grieve is going to prevent people from paying their respects and learn about the victims."" 9/11 Memorial communications manager Anthony Guido said that an exact price has not yet been set, but it will range from $20 to $25. Family members of 9/11 victims are exempt from all memorial-museum fees and charges, Guido said. The museum will open in 2014. According to Guido, 9/11 museum officials looked to other institutions in the country for guidance on admission charges, such as the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum, which charges $12 for adults. The memorial-museum declined to comment on Regenhard's statements. But not all family members of 9/11 victims agree with Regenhard. Charles Wolf told CNN affiliate WCBS: ""I think if it's necessary, they need to do it, because I want this museum to be good. We've taken a horrible, horrible disaster -- in which my wife was lost -- and we're making it better.""

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea has angrily denied allegations that it punished some of its citizens for inadequately mourning the death of its late leader Kim Jong Il. Kim died last month after 17 years of repressive rule over the secretive state, setting off deep uncertainty about North Korea's future. The North Korean regime commemorated his death with elaborately choreographed ceremonies broadcast on state-run media that showed crowds of mourners beating their chests and wailing with grief in the snow-covered streets of Pyongyang. Over the weekend, a report from the state-run Korean Central News Agency lashed out at ""misinformation"" that citizens who had ""failed to show tears at memorial services were sent to a concentration camp."" It attributed the allegations to ""reptile media under the control"" of a group of ""traitors"" that it said were connected to President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea. The news agency appeared to be referring to a report last week by the South Korean news website Daily NK, which monitors developments in the North through a network of sources inside the country. Citing an unidentified person in North Korea, Daily NK reported that ""the authorities are handing down at least six months in a labor-training camp to anybody who didn't participate in the organized gatherings during the mourning period, or who did participate but didn't cry and didn't seem genuine."" The president of Daily NK, Park In-ho, said that the information for its report had come from a North Korean citizen in North Hamgyong Province, which borders China. The unidentified North Korean relayed the information to a Daily NK reporter using an illegal Chinese mobile phone -- commonly used items among people living in the border areas -- Park said. Information from the North is usually communicated to Daily NK reporters in China, who then pass it on to South Korea, according to Park. North Korea significantly restricts the ability of international news organizations to freely report within its territory. Daily NK was founded and then spun off by the Network for North Korean Democracy and Human Rights Network, a nonprofit organization that aims to promote human rights in North Korea. Daily NK has received tens of thousands of dollars in funding from the National Endowment for Democracy, a U.S. nonprofit organization that is supported financially by the U.S. Congress through the Department of State. The Korean Central News Agency report over the weekend expressed anger that the Daily NK report had coincided with Pyongyang's own announcement of a prisoner amnesty in connection with the birthdays this year of two late North Korean dictators -- Kim Jong Il and his father, Kim Il Sung, the founder of the North Korean nation. ""This evil deed could be done only by the despicable guys hell-bent on letting loose invectives and telling lies,"" the KCNA report said. North Korea has not specified how many prisoners will be released under amnesty, due to begin February 1. International organizations estimate that the North Korean regime holds approximately 200,000 political prisoners.","The state-run North Korean news agency attacks ""misinformation"" from ""reptile media""

"London, England (CNN) -- A large protest was happening Saturday in London against the war in Afghanistan, with organizers saying thousands from around the country would take part. Demonstrators were marching from Speakers Corner in Hyde Park to Trafalgar Square, where there were planned speeches from Labour politician Tony Benn, former London Mayor Ken Livingstone, two members of Parliament and others. London's Metropolitan Police said more than 5,000 people were expected to take part. Former British soldier Joe Glenton was one of those marching. He served in Afghanistan and was jailed when he refused to go back, and Friday, he handed back the veterans badge he received when he left the armed forces. ""There's a real upswell of support, and there's something coming,"" he told CNN about the anti-war sentiment he sees in Britain. Also at the protest was Mandy Sylvester, who said her son has been in Afghanistan for four weeks with the British Paratrooper Regiment. As protesters behind her held signs reading, ""Cut war not welfare,"" Sylvester told CNN the war costs too much and is no longer justified. ""The reason why we're there has changed three times, to my knowledge,"" she said. ""The reason why we're there now is because we're there."" The Stop the War Coalition was organizing the demonstration along with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and the British Muslim Initiative. Afghanistan is at the top of the agenda for Saturday's meeting of NATO leaders in Lisbon, Portugal, where they agreed with the Afghan government to leave international forces there for many years after a planned military transition in 2014. Protesters called Saturday for the troops to come home, with one saying they are only ""exacerbating the situation"" by being in Afghanistan. ""Any development that has happened hasn't been for the Afghan people,"" said protester Chaz Singh. ""It's only been for the businesses that have come from America, the U.K., and Europe."" CNN's Craig Johnston contributed to this report.","Protesters hold rally in Trafalgar Square .
