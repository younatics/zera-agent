"Ash dieback is still decimating the countryside, and threatening healthy trees like his one, almost a year after it first struck in Britain . Tree disease ash dieback is still decimating the countryside almost a year after it first struck in Britain. The deadly fungus, which is rife across mainland Europe, is now out of control in the East and South East of England and there have been outbreaks in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Somerset was confirmed as the 15th English county with the fungal disease after staff on the National Trust’s Holnicote Estate near Minehead discovered blighted leaves on a handful of ash trees this month. The latest official figures reveal there are 571 infected sites in Britain, with 334 linked to imported ash trees, 213 in the wider environment and 24 in nurseries. But the actual figure could be higher because as the disease has taken hold, there has been less urgency to report new cases. Forestry Commission staff are now conducting a new survey of woodlands in the East and South East of England to gain a clearer picture of the how disease has spread in the wild. Infected trees are no longer being felled, in the hope of finding mature trees that are resistant to the disease, which is known as Chalara fraxinea. Once the traits associated with resistance are identified, resistant trees can be developed. Ash dieback was found for the first time in the National Forest last month, at three sites near the town of Swadlincote in Derbyshire. A man burns saplings in a bid to stop the spread of ash dieback disease . Mike Seville, forestry and woodlands adviser at the Country Land and Business Association, said: ‘There is a general acceptance that it is going to be impossible to eradicate the disease and slow the spread.’ Austin Brady, head of conservation at the Woodland Trust, said: ‘Ash dieback has spread across the country in devastating fashion over the past 12 months. 'It has become clear that stopping its spread is an impossible task. What we need to focus on now is building a resilient wooded landscape. ‘By doing so our precious woodland stands a better chance of resisting the many threats posed by disease.’ It has become clear that stopping the spread of ash dieback fungus (pictured) is 'an impossible task' The Forestry Commission denied the disease was ‘out of control’ but a spokesman said: ‘Everyone agrees  it is currently neither possible nor feasible to eradicate it. ‘Sensibly, efforts are concentrating on monitoring and slowing the disease. Infected ash trees that were planted some time ago have been found at a small number of sites, but more research would  be required to check if they were infected when they were planted or more recently.’ Plant health chiefs confirmed the first case of the disease in the British countryside last October at Pound Farm in Suffolk, a site owned by the Woodland Trust. As autumn sets in, it is easy to spot diseased ash trees because their leaves are black and do not fall.","Disease out of control in the East and South East of England .

"An anonymous passenger brightened a Philadelphia cab driver's night with the tip of a lifetime: nearly $1,000 on a $4.31 fare. Oumar Maiga's bosses revealed the hefty, holiday-season gratuity Wednesday after waiting to make sure the credit card cleared and it wasn't an error. The West African immigrant received the $989.98 tip December 13. Proof: Philadelphia cabbie Oumar Maiga was given a massive tip of nearly $1,000 after giving a man a ride that took barely one minute . 'I've heard of some large tips before, but nothing this big,' Everett M. Abitbol, co-founder of Freedom Taxi, told Philly.com. 'It couldn't have happened to a better guy.' According to Abitbol, his lucky employee is a family man who pulls six or seven shifts per week to provide for his family and send a chunk back to his family in West Africa. Abitbol said the cabbie and passenger chatted briefly during the mile-long trip from the city's Old City section to Columbus Boulevard. Maiga said his shift had been a little hectic. The passenger said he'd make it a great night and punched in the tip. Maiga asked if he'd made a mistake. The passenger replied, 'I know what I did.' Abitbol said the identity of tipper remains a mystery and will likely stay that way. 'We've tried to get in touch with him, but the credit card company won't divulge his name,' Abitbol said. 'The fare was not disputed. That's all they would say.'

"A family in Illinois have created their very own ice kingdom modeled after Disney's Frozen - with a 45-foot-tall icicle being the piece de resistance. Katherine Ragel, 56, from St. Elmo recruited her son, Garrick Moreland, to help make the giant structure. The arbor man climbed into a tree in minus degree weather with a hose and turned on the water. It took eight days for the icicle to reach the ground. Magical: A family in Illinois have created their very own ice kingdom modeled after Disney's Frozen - with a 45-foot-tall icicle being the piece de resistance . The mother-son duo completed their winter wonderland with a mannequin of Princess Esla. They also dotted other characters from Frozen around the front yard including Anna, Kristoff, and the Olaf the snowman. Despite being proud of her display, Ragel is worried here might be an accident because passing traffic sometimes stops in the 'middle of the road' to catch a glimpse of it. 'People honk and wave,' she told The Effingham Daily News. Ragel's idea for the giant icicle originally came from her late husband, Alan, who liked to build smaller ones along the driveway. Finishing touch: Katherine Ragel, 56, from St. Elmo completed her winter wonderland with a mannequin of Princess Esla . Head-turner: The widow recruited her son, Garrick Moreland, to help make the giant icicle which is also decked out with night lights . He did attempt making one before his death in 2012 but it only grew to only about 30 feet. Ragel posted an image of her son's new 45-foot sculpture to Facebook this week. She wrote in the caption field: 'Hopefully weather lets it stay a while. 'I enjoy seeing little kids faces plastered against the windows as they drive by.' She and her son are now working on adding the Frozen theme music after wiring up night lights.

"Forget Chanel handbags and green juices, all you need to gain a loyal following on Instagram is a chihuahua and a pair of scissors. Collage artist Klee Van Schoonhoven, 37, spends her spare time photographing her tiny pooch Goldie in amusing positions using pages cut out from fashion magazines. The cleverly created project sees the ten-year-old pooch pose alongside famous style icons including Kate Moss and Pharrell Williams. Collage artist Klee Van Schoonhoven uses magazine cut outs to manipulate her chihuahua into high fashion pictures. Here Goldie takes on the role of model Cara Delevingne . Goldie often poses as or with famous fashion characters, (left) the pooch takes on the role of the notorious US Vogue editor, Anna Wintour and poses alongside model Kate Moss (right) One photograph even sees the stylish pup take on the role of the infamous US Vogue editor Anna Wintour. Klee, who lives in New York, says she originally started the project, which she shares on Instagram, with a children's book in mind, but Goldie's expressions and attitude leaned more towards subtle adult humour. 'I have always loved and collected images from fashion magazines,' said the creative student. Klee doesn't use computer trickery to create her images and simply relies on her dog's patient to get the perfect picture - seen here posing with Pharrell Williams . Klee loves reading the positive comments that Goldie receives online and says its great to turn photos that often make women feel bad about themselves, into something humorous . 'I found the juxtaposition of a chihuahua and high-end fashion highly amusing and thought others would too - that's when I began the Instagram feed.' Klee captures Goldie using just her iPhone and never manipulates her images with software. She said: 'I have a set at home where we shoot everything. I create most of the props using magazine clippings that I cut into shape and mount.' Klee says that Goldie can be a real diva on set and will bark when she is ready to have her photograph taken . Goldie's amusing poses have earned her almost 5000 followers on Instagram . Goldie proves to be a real diva on set and gives her owner anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute to get the shot before becoming distracted and trotting off. Klee says that when it comes to photographing her pooch she always adheres to her demands. 'Sometimes she will randomly hop onto set and bark to let me know she is ready to shoot. 'I just prepare the props and follow her lead - don't let her fool you, she's the boss.' Klee takes her professional looking shots using nothing more than her iPhone camera . Goldie only gives Klee 30 seconds to a minute of her attention before she chooses to walk off set . Klee says that she was thrilled with the response and was happy that Goldie has picked up a lot of fans in the internet with the dog having almost 5,000 followers on Instagram. 'I love reading comments which say seeing a picture of Goldie being her naturally ridiculous self has brightened their day. 'If Goldie's head breaking through pictures of perfection that might normally make someone feel bad about themselves makes them smile - then that makes me happy.' Klee creates her props by cutting images out of fashion magazines and mounting them .

"For Il Divo star Sébastien Izambard, standing on stage at the famed Marquis Theatre on Broadway was a momentous occasion. Indeed, for the entire group, it was a dream come true as they debuted their new show A Musical Affair last week. What was once a ‘popera’ act created by Simon Cowell -  which as bandmate David Miller admits no-one believed would last longer than two years - had now reached this pinnacle, spanning 10 years and selling more than 26 million albums worldwide. But for French-born Sébastien especially, the work has been grueling as he has strives to juggle Il Divo and his growing family – jetting home to see his wife and three young children between shows around the globe. Happy family: Il Divo star Sébastien Izambard and his wife Renee have three children - and are now discussing a fourth - as they juggle his hectic touring schedule . Broadway-bound: Il Divo, from left, Carlos Marin, Sébastien Izambard, Urs Bühler and David Miller, leave the ITV studios in London in April. They launched A Musical Affair on Broadway last week . New York, New York: Il Divo warble some of the musical greats during their show at the Marquis Theatre on opening night on Broadway last Wednesday . And for the first time, Sébastien, 40, reveals just why it’s so important to him to make sure he spends as much time as possible with his beloved wife Renee, and their five-year-old twins Luca and Rose and two-year-old son Jude. When he was just six, the dashing Parisian’s father Maurice left him and his mother Marie, then only 24. And in an exclusive interview today, Sébastien tells MailOnline: ‘I had a difficult childhood, I didn’t have very present parents because they separated early and my mum had to keep everything together and manage a child and work. ‘She was young and she was not very much around, she did the best she could with what she had. But I had to manage myself from an early age, I didn’t have a lot of support, so that’s why I’m really present with my children.’ Once revealing he lived with his mother in a ‘tiny room on top of an apartment block, with an outside toilet and only a sink to wash in’, Sébastien went on to become a pop star in France at 21 after telling how the piano became his ‘therapist’. Daddy: Sébastien Izambard says Simon Cowell, who created Il Divo, will be a good father to his baby son, adding: 'I think that people you don't expect to be changing nappies suddenly change' And he is quick to add: ‘I’m very close to my mum now…I don’t see my father - I made a choice, but I feel like I’m good, I’m lucky.’ After meeting his wife Renee in her native Australia where she worked as a publicist for Sony, the couple wed in August 2008. However, Renee suffered not just one but two difficult pregnancies, battling a host of health problems. The first culminated in their twins being born three months prematurely by emergency caesarean as Renee developed the condition pre-eclampsia, with dangerously high blood pressure – prompting Sébastien to pull out of an Il Divo tour of Japan as he says: ‘There was no question, it was not easy to understand for the group, but my family will always come first. I could not perform, I had to be by her side.’ For weeks it was not known whether the tiny babies would survive. And during her second labour, with their son Jude, now two, Renee came close to death herself after suffering placental abruption. As Sébastien told the Mail in 2011:‘It’s been very difficult but it pulled us closer together. We have risked death to be parents.’ Renee has spoken out about her pregnancy battles and Sébastien says: ‘I’m pleased that she spoke about it, pre-eclampsia is the number one death in pregnancy. ‘It’s such a difficult thing and not enough is known. The reality is that we have some friends who’ve gone in and in 10 minutes had a nice delivery, but we had none of that, what we experienced means everything is more precious. ‘It was definitely risky for Renee and the kids, it was really tough.’ Clearly . proud of his family, Sébastien delights in recounting their recent . visits to the zoos and museums around Manhattan after Renee and the . children – whom he says are already musical much to his chagrin, . sighing: ‘I don’t want them to do what Daddy does, I want to keep them . at home!’ Miracles: The twins that Sébastien Izambard and his wife Renee thought they may lose when they were born three months prematurely. Luca and Rose are now five and thriving . Devoted: Sébastien Izambard, pictured in New York last week, says he is even more appreciative of his young family after suffering a difficult childhood . He adds: ‘Renee was here with the kids for the last two weeks and it was utterly madness, we have five-year-old twins and a two-year-old like a rugby player, he’s like his granddad who’s 6ft 5, so it was challenging.’ But, he reveals that during the visit: ‘We talked about having a fourth one when we settle, probably in California, next year. ‘We would like to have another one…I’m an only child and I dreamed of having a big family. The problem is finding the right balance between family and work. ‘Renee was in the entertainment industry, she understands the downside of having a husband who comes home and sleeps, but somehow it just works, we manage to find a balance and it seems to be working for now.’ 'We talked about having a fourth child when we settle, probably in California, next year. I’m an only child and I dreamed of . having a big family...The problem is finding the right balance between . family and work' As for Mr Cowell, who created Il Divo after having the idea of forming a modern day Three Tenors, Sébastien laughs when asked about the music millionaire’s impending fatherhood. Cowell’s baby boy with girlfriend Lauren Silverman is due in February and Sébastien says: ‘Everyone wonders what Simon will be like as a father, but I think he’ll be good. ‘I think people that you don’t expect to be changing nappies suddenly change. When you become a dad you change, that’s the way it is, you have this little life relying on you, good and bad. ‘I’m very hands on with my kids. I would be a manny! I would be happy to be at home with my kids, but I can see how challenging it is.’ And indeed, his fellow bandmate, David . Miller says he and his wife, stunning opera singer Sarah Joy – who . recently played tragic Anna Nicole Smith in the New York City Opera’s . production – have decided that ‘right now isn’t the time’ for them to . become parents. Singing sensations: Il Divo tenor David Miller and his wife Sarah Joy Miller at the opening night of Anna Nicole The Opera in September, in which Sarah Joy had the starring role . Tragic: David Miller's wife Sarah Joy Miller played tragic playmate Anna Nicole Smith in the New York City Opera's production in September . Married to Sarah Joy since 2009, David, 40, tells MailOnline: ‘We talk about it a lot, we look at Sebastian – but the children would have to be travelling or they would have to be raised by a nanny and that’s not something either of us want. We’re both very emotional people and very attached to the people in our lives. ‘It wouldn’t be fair, one of our careers would have to give.’ Along with their fellow bandmates, . Spanish baritone Carlos Marín, Swiss tenor Urs Bühler, Sébastien and . David will now tour America and Canada with A Musical Affair following . their six-night run on Broadway. This will be followed by a worldwide tour from next September. Sébastien . says: ‘The show’s going great, it’s wonderful to be in one place and . it’s very refreshing to sing a new repertoire rather than having to sing . Unbreak My Heart for the 30,000th time! The songs are beautiful.’ Tour: Il Divo will now take A Musical Affair around America and Canada, it was revealed today . Talent: Il Divo join Heather Headley, who stars in A Musical Affair, at the America's Got Talent finale at NYC's Radio City Music Hall in September . With David being the last member to be signed to Il Divo in December 2003 following a worldwide two-year search, Sébastien admits: ‘It’s a miracle in terms of what happened for the four of us. ‘We don’t seem to be a band that seems to rest! In terms of recording, Simon is able to trust us, we’re really independent and we’re grown up – and he’s going to have a lot to deal with!’ David adds: ‘Il Divo has had a much longer life than any of us thought it would – it’s gone on about eight years longer than anyone – the group, Simon, our management – thought it would. No-one could have predicted our global success. ‘We didn’t expect to get to this point, I would love to see Il Divo continue as long as people still enjoy what we do.’ For more on tickets to Il Divo's A Musical Affair go to www.ildivo.com .","French singer reveals how a 'difficult childhood' has made him closer to his own kids .

"Most Wanted: Yaser Abdel Said, 57, is wanted for killing his two daughters in 2008 . A man suspected of carrying out brutal 'honor killings' on his two teenage daughters on New Year's Day 2008 has been added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. Yaser Abdel Said, 57, allegedly shot dead Amina, 18, and Sarah, 17, in a hotel parking lot in Irving, Texas, after driving them there in his taxi. The girls were found slumped in the car, both with multiple gunshot wounds. In 911 calls moments before they died, Sarah told operators 'Help! My dad shot me' and 'Oh my God, I'm dying'. According to the Dallas Morning News, relatives said Said would often beat his daughters, and killed them both when he found out they had American boyfriends. Said, an Egyptian, was last seen in 2008. FBI investigators say Said carries a gun at all times, and is dangerous to approach. An official profile states that he always wears dark sunglasses, even indoors. He is said to love eating at IHOP and Denny's, and black German shepherd dogs. He smokes Marlboro Light 100 cigarettes and is likely to be working as a taxi driver. The Bureau said Said, an Egyptian, has links to the states of New York, Virginia and Texas, as well as Canada and Egypt. He is likely to be sheltering in Egyptian communities. 'Honor killings': Said, left, had reportedly forbidden his daughters Sarah, center, and Amina, right, from having American boyfriends, and killed them when he learned that they did. The FBI says that he always wears dark glasses . Bullet wounds: Amina, right, and Sarah, left, were found in the back of a taxi with multiple gunshot wounds on January 1, 2008 . It is widely suspected that Said thought his daughters had brought shame on the family so decided to kill them. He has been described as an overly protective parent who exercised a lot of control over his daughters. According to a recent documentary film about the killings, Amina had sent emails saying she thought her father would kill her. FBI officials have offered a $100,000 reward for information that leads to his capture. On the run: Authorities have been seeking Said since the killings. A description said he has graying black hair, but he has also been photographed bald . 'Controlling': Said was described as a domineering parent who exercised a lot of control over his daughters . Commenting on the renewed attention, the chief of the police force in Irving said his officers 'will not give up' in their pursuit of him. Chief Larry Boyd said: 'This homicide is particularly disturbing because the one person whom Amina and Sarah Said should have been able to look to for protection is the very person who we believe took their lives. 'Yaser Said has been on the run since he committed this heinous act, but we will not give up on our quest to bring him in.' The FBI file says Said is 6'2"" with black hair, which is graying, and weighs 180lbs. He has also been photographed with a shaved head. However, they warned he may have changed his appearance to dodge capture.","Yaser Abdel Said, 57, allegedly gunned down his daughters six years ago .

"Canary babies: Gladys Sangster, now 97, said she was born with yellow-tinged skin . The First World War left a taint on everyone - but for some it happened more literally than others. Now 97, Gladys Sangster is one of Britain's last surviving 'Canary Babies', born yellow because her mother worked on the Home Front pouring dangerous chemicals into shells. She has long since lost her yellow glow, but claims it affected many of the children born where she still lives in Banbury, Oxfordshire. More than 1,500 people there worked in National Shell Filling Factory Number Nine on the outskirts of Banbury during the Great War. As many of them were women, they became known as the 'Canary Girls' when their skin became tainted by touching chemicals in the TNT powder they poured into bombs. Traditional gunpowder had been replaced by materials such as cordite and sulphur which were mixed by hand despite being dangerous to human health. The women's skin would break out into hives, their hair would be discoloured and although there were few injuries at Banbury, those in other factories lost their lives and limbs when explosives went off prematurely. Less well known was that the same yellow colouring would apparently happen to their children - who were dubbed the 'Canary Babies'. Mrs Sangster's mother Mary was in charge of a full team of women at the factory in Banbury, one of the largest of its kind in the country. Her father, meanwhile, would accompany the filled shells by train to the coast where they would be shipped off to the front line on the Continent. Mary Sangster brought in a doctor to examine her daughter, but was told there was nothing she could do - and the colour faded within a short time. It seemed none of her family ever . investigated whether there was a long-term risk to her health, but as . far as Mrs Sangster knows she suffered no ill effects - and she is still . going strong at 97. Canary girls: The women in munitions factories have been honoured after suffering burns and skin rashes. Though there were few injuries at Banbury, some at other factories were blown up or maimed . War effort: Gladys Sangster's mother Mary (left with her husband) led a team of women such as the one right . 'Nearly every baby was born yellow,' she said. 'Mum said you just took it for granted it happened and that was it. You . were tougher in those days than what they are today!' National Shell Filling Factory Number Nine is now in a field overgrown with brambles. There is little to betray its former use - but because of it, the land is a protected site of archaeological significance. Gladys's remarkable tale was revealed when she told her story to a volunteer project for the town's Banbury Museum. They decided to record her experiences for posterity - one set among 1,400 in a new nationwide project by the Imperial War Museum and the BBC to mark 100 years since the outbreak of war. Women on the Home Front: Photographer G P Lewis captured human scenes of wives and daughters working . Underappreciated: The women often risked their lives to make sure the country kept running during the war . World War One At Home is showcasing first-hand accounts of life on the Home Front in a series of broadcasts on BBC local radio stations, designed to link people to the war town by town. Mrs Sangster's story was broadcast on Monday on BBC Radio Oxford. Jane Markham, a researcher on the project, said: 'The chemicals that turned the women's skin yellow seemed to be very particular to the women who were working at close quarters to explosives. 'To have somebody still alive who can talk about something like this that happened 100 years ago is quite remarkable.' BBC head of English programmes . Craig Henderson said: 'These stories reveal familiar places across the . nation in a new and fascinating light; places that we might drive or . walk past every day without realising their historical resonance.

Smith does not have a prior criminal record, according to public records. She is not believed to be married. According to KPLR, the victim and the accused had told authorities that they were 'in love'. In a statement to Daily Mail Online, St Charles County Prosecutor, Tim Lohmar, said: 'The defendant is innocent until proven guilty. There's no such thing as consensual sex with a child.

"A 5-year-old boy who was mauled by two Rottweiler dogs and is in serious condition at a Seattle hospital owes his life to his quick-thinking and brave mother. A Harborview Medical Center nursing supervisor says the boy is in the intensive care unit Wednesday following surgery. Kitsap County sheriff's Deputy Scott Wilson says the boy suffered bites to his head, face and neck Tuesday at a home in Silverdale before his mother threw her body atop his to protect him. Mauled: Three Rottweilers, one seen here being led from the Silverdale, Washington home, mauled a 5-year-old boy Tuesday before his mother rushed in to save his life . Wilson says the boy's mother covered the child with her body until another relative could rescue the boy. The mother was caring for the dogs as a favor to an ex-boyfriend, who is in prison. The boy was playing outside with one dog when they attacked as a pack, Kitsap County Sheriff's spokesman Scott Wilson told KIRO. The mother used her body like a blanket to cover her son and protect him from further bites. Another relative soon saved the boy, who was rushed to a hospital for emergency surgery . 'She couldn't get the dogs off the child because they were too strong, so she laid on the child and the dogs started nipping at her,' Wilson said. The dogs have been turned over to Kitsap Animal Rescue to be tested for rabies, which is standard procedure in such cases. Wilson said he does not expect criminal charges to be filed in the case. 'I don't think it was ever conceived that the dogs were dangerous,' Wilson said. 'There'd been no predisposition, no attacks, no anything.' The boy's condition was upgraded Wednesday to serious.

"What happens when you bring together 40 professional dancers and 40 treadmills? An epic fitness flash mob, of course. The high-energy video was shot on location in Logan, Utah, and was conceptualised by fitness equipment manufacturer, NordicTrack. Forty professional dancers, along with YouTube and Vine stars, came together for an epic fitness flash mob . Filmed on location in Logan, Utah, the dancers jogged in place on and off for over 12 hours during the shoot . Twelve YouTube and Vine stars were on hand to create the musical masterpiece, dancing along to the song The Str!ke by band Atom Bomb. Choreographed by Jason Celaya, it featured local dance teams like My Bad Crew, USU Dance Companies, Dance Factory, and USU Dance Club. Over the course of a grueling 12 hours, the 40 dancers jog-danced in high altitude - and, on occasion, on an incline - while being filmed on an Epic Red Dragon and 4k Sony f7 camera. The high-energy melody - a song called The Strike by Atom Bomb - provided the soundtrack . As part of NordicTrack's #makefunhappen campaign, the video was released and has since gone viral . The music video showcases NordicTrack's new technology and has already been viewed 2.1 million times .

"My three children - ranging in age from nine to 12, and not hugely experienced on the slopes - are desperate to ski an Olympic run. That will be a challenge almost as tricky as finding a family ski holiday that doesn't mean financial meltdown. Miraculously, the tiny Italian resort of Sansicario meets everyone's demands. It was purpose built for Italy's 2006 Winter Games and is part of the Milky Way, one of the world's largest ski areas. Suitable for junior snow demons: Sansicario has a nice mix of slopes for skiers of all levels . The four-star Hotel Majestic is an hour from Turin, and it's a steal. It has a children's club, indoor pool, entertainment, afternoon tea, and free wine with dinner. One morning, my husband and I explore the neighbouring resorts of Sauze D'Oulx and Sestriere (included in the lift pass), which offer great skiing and are easily accessible. Back in the hotel, our children's mantra continues: 'We want to do the Olympic run.' The day finally arrives. I lead the troops up a steep drag lift towards the summit. There is only one way to go. 'Is this a black run?' asks nine-year-old Hannah. 'No,' I lie, adding: 'Be careful and go slow.' They speed off like demons - gold medals all round. Crystal Ski (0203 468 6854, www.crystalski.co.uk) has a week's half-board at the four-star Hotel Majestic in Sansicario, from £569 per adult and £455 per child - including flights, transfers, afternoon tea and unlimited house wine.","The tiny Italian resort of Sansicario was built for the 2006 Winter Olympics .

"The Duchess looked at ease as she mingled with guests at Windsor Castle alongside William and Harry today . Kate's wool dress was from catwalk designer Emilia Wickstead's current collection . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge today joined dozens of royals from around the globe for a special lunch celebrating the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. Wearing a £1,200 pink Emilia Wickstead dress with pleated skirt, Kate looked entirely at ease as she mingled with the international royals, chatting warmly with Princess Charlene of Monaco and sharing a joke with the King of Jordan and his wife. A sneak peek at the seating plan showed there were 24 Kings and Queens, one Emperor, a Grand Duke and a Sultan. Eight princesses, an Emir and a lone Empress added a further layer of gravitas to the mix. Perfect hosts: Kate wore a simple pleated dress by Emilia Wickstead as she joined William in welcoming thte world's Royals for the Queen's celebratory lunch at Windsor Castle today . Today's World Sovereign’s lunch at Windsor Castle to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee was almost certainly the largest gathering of crowned heads of state since our own Queen’s coronation in 1953. But the joyousness of the occasion was overshadowed by a growing row about some of the more controversial names on her guest list and sparked demonstrations outside Buckingham Palace, where a second lavish black tie dinner was being thrown later in day by Prince Charles for some of the lunch guests. Indeed the Queen, who has spent the last 60 years managing to sidestep such political controversy, has found herself accused of making a catastrophic error of judgment today by dining with the King of Bahrain, whose regime is accused of a catalogue of human rights abuses. Celebratory mood: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were joined by Prince Harry for a drinks reception in the castle's Waterloo Chamber before a three-course meal using all-British ingredients . At ease: Kate chats to King Simeon of Bulgaria and his wife Margarita . Girl talk: The Duchess of Cambridge chatted to Charlene, Princess of Monaco, who looked stylish with a new shorter hair cut . Playing host: William talked to Prince Albert II of Monaco while Kate entertained his wife Charlene . Joyous occasion: The Monaco royals were among the largest gathering of crowned heads of state since our own Queen's coronation in 1953 . International relations: Kate shares a joke with one of the Queen's royal guests, one of 98 who arrived at Windsor to enjoy a sit-down lunch with the British monarch . Also singled out for criticism is Swaziland’s King Mswati 111, who has been accused of living an obscenely lavish lifestyle while many of his people starve. Similarly Prince Mohammed Bin Nawaf Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, the country’s Ambassador to Britain, comes from a country not entirely renowned for its democratic practices. Another guest, the former Prime Minister of Kuwait, Sheikh Nasser Mohammad Al-Sabah, is also mired in controversy after stepping down over a corruption row. However the Queen, who has been advised by the Foreign Office, appeared unperturbed by the furore and made a point of personally greeting Bahrain’s King Hamad Al-Khalifa as he arrived at the Castle. The pair even shared a private joke together. Got the blues? Princess Charlene chose a powder blue suit for the occasion, adhering to Royal protocol by teaming them with closed-toe courts . Protocol: Princess Charlene curtseys deeply to the Queen as she and Prince Albert arrive at the Castle . Pleased to meet you: Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice with Princess Sabika of Bahrain . Elegant: Princess Srirasm of Thailand wore a pretty blush pink silk top with metallic skirt, left, while the Crown Princess Margarita of Romania chose vibrant red for the lunch . First to arrive for pre-lunch drinks in the Waterloo Chamber was Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein, soon followed by Grand Duke Henri and Grand Duchess Maria Teresa of Luxembourg. The Grand Duke and Duchess were warmly greeted by the Queen and Duke with handshakes and double kisses - a display of affection that set the tone for many of the welcomes. King Harald V of Norway kissed the Queen’s hand when he and his wife Queen Sonja met the monarch and she replied with a beaming smile. Prince Albert II of Monaco was more formal with just a handshake while his wife, Princess Charlene, gave a low curtsey. The most extravagant welcome, however, came from Queen Beatrix of Netherland who flung open her arms as she approached the Queen before kissing her warmly. All senior members of the British Royal Family were present including the Duchess of Cambridge, Prince William, and brother-in-law, Prince Harry, as well as other younger royals including Prince Andrew’s daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, who were seen chatting animatedly to the wife of the King of Bahrain, Princess Sabeeka bint Ibrahim Al Khalifa. Controversial: Queen Elizabeth greets the King of Bahrain at today's lunch, while angry demonstrators outside the castle protested against the monarch's decision to invite the anti-democratic Middle Eastern leader . Polite: The Duke of Edinburgh greets Bahrain's King and his wife after the Queen has done her duty . Close: Queen Margrethe of Denmark greets the British monarch warmly... and is treated to a kiss on the hand by Prince Philip . Fortunately King Mswatsi of Swaziland brought just one of his 13 wives, the third ranked but apparently most favoured Inkhosikati LaMbikiza, who wore a rather eye-catching pair of Pearly Queen-style shoes with feathery pom-poms on the toes and heels. Thirteen is, by all accounts, a relatively modest total. His father boasted more than 70 spouses - which would really have shaken up the seating plan. The event had the atmosphere of a family gathering, despite the opulent surroundings, with everyone chatting loudly as they caught up. The British Royal Family circulated around the chamber mingling with their foreign guests. At one point Prince Harry was engrossed in conversation with the Saudi Ambassador while his brother William and wife Kate chatted to King of Jordan Abdullah II and his wife Queen Rania. Controversial: King Mswati III of Swaziland and Inkhosikati LaMbikiza, his third ranking wife, but said to be his favourite arrive at Windsor Castle - and Inkhosikati wears some rather fetching feather-trimmed heels. The Swaziland King has been criticised for living an obscenely lavish lifestyle while his people starve . Tribute to our Pearly Queen? Inkhosikati LaMbikiza's shoes were trimmed with jewels, sequins and feathers . Taking a bow: Grand Duke Henri and Grand Duchess Maria Teresa of Luxembourg arrive at the castle, right, Crown Prince Alexander II of Yugoslavia and his wife, the Crown Princess Katarina . More arrivals: King Letsie III of Lesotho and Queen Mesenate Mohato Seeiso are greeted by a member of household staff, left. Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko of Japan, right, arrive at the Castle . Friendly welcome: The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh greet the King and Queen of Norway to the Jubilee . Close: Her Majesty greets the Queen of the Netherlands in the rare meeting of world monarchs . Wealthy: Her Majesty meets the Sultan of Brunei and wife Raja Isteri Pengira Anak Hajah Saleha . Edward joked loudly ‘safety in numbers?’ when he found King Mswati III and King Letsie III of Lesotho, along with their spouses, standing together chatting. After drinks the 62 royals (plus guests, making 98 diners in all) headed into the magnificent St George' Hall for lunch, where they were seated relatively informally in round tables of up to 12. STARTER . Poached egg with English asparagus . MAIN COURSE . Noisettes of new season Windsor lamb . PUDDING . Juicy Kent-grown strawberries . Each group had at least one sovereign and their spouse, a member of the British royal family and a member of the royal Household seated together. On the menu was a starter of poached egg with English asparagus, noisettes of new season Windsor lamb and juicy Kent-grown strawberries. Before the guests sat down to lunch, 21 crowned heads and the six foreign royals representing their sovereigns sat down for a group picture. They filed into a room where chairs and standing places had been set up with their home country's flags placed where they should be. The King of Bahrain appeared to be having a fit of giggles as was the Sultan of Brunei, sitting in front of him.As the photographer began taking the pictures the Queen, who was sitting in the centre of the group, joked: 'Are you supposed to be enjoying this?'

Royal procession: Members of the public look on as motorcades containing world leaders began arriving at Windsor Castle earlier this afternoon . Society favourite: Designer Emilia Wickstead with loyal client Samantha Cameron . British based, New Zealand-born designer Emilia Wickstead has fast become one of the go-to designers for London's high society. In business just three years, Ms Wickstead has already dressed a number of royals - not least Kate, who wore an emerald Emilia Wickstead coat dress for a St Patrick's Day appearance earlier this year. Kate has been spotted various times visiting the atelier in London's Belgravia, and is said to be a great fan of the brand. Privately, Ms Wickstead is said to be delighted the Kate has shown interest in her collection. Ms Wickstead also dressed a number of VIP guests invited to last year's Royal Wedding, including Kate's cousin Lucy, Anya Hindmarch, Georgina Cadbury, Lady Kitty Spencer, Emma Parker Bowles and India Hicks, who was a bridesmaid to Princess Diana. But Emilia's client base is not restricted to the upper echelons royalty. Ms Wickstead can also count Dannii Minogue and Samantha Cameron as trusted customers, both of whom have worn her designs on many occasions. Most recently, Samantha Cameron wore multiple pieces from Wickstead's collection on a visit to the U.S. in March. The designer's spring/summer 2012 collection, a pretty collection in candybox hues, was described by Wickstead herself as being a 'mixture of sophistication and playfulness - fashionable women who entertain'. Perfectly suited for the Duchess's central role today. 'We are happy, delighted and excited to see Kate in one of our designs, a spokesman for Emilia Wickstead said today. 'She looked lovely.'

"A suburban mother is behind bars following a string of suspected bank heists with her boyfriend. Elizabeth Kenneally from Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, is being held in Bucks County Prison after CCTV footage allegedly showed her robbing three high-street branches with Christopher LeBlanc, 40, the son of a former mayor. The 25-year-old, who has a two-year-old son, went missing on October 15 prompting her family and local authorities to hand out fliers and start a campaign on social media to track her down.

"Google has halted sales of its controversial Glass wearable computer - but promises new versions are coming. The troubled product has failed to fire the public's imagination, with wearers dubbed 'glassholes' and even many Google employees abandoning them. The company insists it is still committed to launching the smart glasses as a consumer product, but will stop producing Glass in its present form, according to the BBC. Scroll down for video . Goggle's Glass is expected to get a total makeover, and will switch chip suppliers to Intel . Google told the BBC it will  focus on 'future versions of Glass'. The Explorer programme, gave software developers the chance to buy Glass for $1,500 (£990), and was launched in the United States in 2013, and the UK last summer. From next week, the search firm will stop taking orders for the product but it says it will continue to support companies that are using Glass. The firm had already been thought to be developing a new version with chips made by Intel to go on sale later this year. The Glass team is also expected to now  move out of the Google X division which engages in 'blue sky' research, and become a separate undertaking, under its current manager Ivy Ross. She and the Glass team will report to Tony Fadell, the chief executive of the home automation business Nest, acquired by Google a year ago, the BBC says. He said the project had 'broken ground and allowed us to learn what's important to consumers and enterprises alike' and he was excited to be working with the team 'to integrate those learnings into future products'. Google says it is committed to working on the future of the product, but gave no timescale for the launch of an improved product. 'It’s hard to believe that Glass started as little more than a scuba mask attached to a laptop,' the Glass team said in a post on Google+. 'We kept on it, and when it started to come together, we began the Glass Explorer Program as a kind of “open beta” to hear what people had to say.' 'Glass was in its infancy, and you took those very first steps and taught us how to walk. 'Well, we still have some work to do, but now we’re ready to put on our big kid shoes and learn how to run.' Where's the Glass? Sergey Brin was spotted without Google's specs at a Silicon Valley red-carpet event last yeat. Since they were unveiled, he has rarely been seen without them. 'Since we first met, interest in wearables has exploded and today it’s one of the most exciting areas in technology. 'As we look to the road ahead, we realize that we’ve outgrown the lab and so we’re officially “graduating” from Google[x] to be our own team here at Google. We’re thrilled to be moving even more from concept to reality. 'As part of this transition, we’re closing the Explorer Program so we can focus on what’s coming next.' In the meantime, we’re continuing to build for the future, and you’ll start to see future versions of Glass when they’re ready. (For now, no peeking.) According to the report, Glass will switch from its dead Texas Instruments chip to a processor built by Intel and will get a full hardware refresh. Recently it emerged that the consumer version, which Google promised would go on sale this year, has now been delayed until 2015 - raising questions over its future. Late last year, of 16 Glass app makers contacted by Reuters, nine said that . they had stopped work on their projects or abandoned them, . mostly because of the lack of customers or limitations of the . device. Three more have switched to developing for business, . leaving behind consumer projects. However, plenty of larger developers remain with Glass. The nearly . 100 apps on the official web site include Facebook and . OpenTable, although one major player recently defected: Twitter. Google founder Sergey Brin (L) and designer Diane von Furstenberg sit and watch the rehearsal for her Spring/Summer 2013 collection show during New York Fashion Week, where  new Google Glass frameswere launched in a bid to make them more appealing. Glass was the first project to emerge from Google's X division, the secretive group tasked with developing 'moonshot'products such as self-driving cars. Glass and wearable devices overall amount to a new technology, as smartphones once were,that will likely take time to evolve into a product that clickswith consumers. 'If there was 200 million Google Glasses sold, it would be a . different perspective,' said Tom Frencel, the Chief Executive of Little Guy Games, which put development of a Glass game on hold this year and is looking at other platforms, including the Facebook Inc-owned virtual-reality goggles Oculus Rift. 'There's no market at this point,' Several key Google employees instrumental to developing . Glass have left the company in the last six months, including . lead developer Babak Parviz, electrical engineering chief Adrian . Wong, and Ossama Alami, director of developer relations. And a Glass funding consortium created by Google Ventures . and two of Silicon Valley's biggest venture capitalists, Kleiner . Perkins Caufield & Byers and Andreessen Horowitz, quietly . deleted its website, routing users to the main Glass site. Google insists it is committed to Glass, with hundreds of . engineers and executives working on it, as well as new . fashionista boss Ivy Ross, a former Calvin Klein executive. 'We are completely energized and as energized as ever about . the opportunity that wearables and Glass in particular . represent,' said Glass Head of Business Operations Chris . O'Neill. 'We are as committed as ever to a consumer launch. 'That is . going to take time and we are not going to launch this product . until it's absolutely ready,' O'Neill said. After an initial burst of enthusiasm, signs that consumers are giving up on Glass have been building.Some developers recently have felt unsupported by investorsand, at times, Google itself. Brin had predicted a launch this year, but 2015 is now the . most likely date, a person familiar with the matter said. After an initial burst of enthusiasm, signs that consumers . are giving up on Glass have been building. Some developers recently have felt unsupported by investors . and, at times, Google itself. The Glass Collective, the funding consortium co-run by . Google Ventures, invested in only three or four small start-ups . by the beginning of this year, a person familiar with the . statistics said. A Google Ventures spokeswoman declined to comment on the . number of investments and said the Web site was closed for . simplicity. 'We just found it's easier for entrepreneurs to come . to us directly,' she said. The lack of a launch date has given some developers the . impression that Google still treats Glass as an experiment. Google dubbed the first set of several thousand Glass users . as 'Explorers.' But as the Explorers hit the streets, they drew . stares and jokes. Some people viewed the device, capable of . surreptitious video recording, as an obnoxious privacy . intrusion, deriding the once-proud Explorers as 'Glassholes.' 'It looks super nerdy,' said Shevetank Shah, a Washington, . DC-based consultant, whose Google Glass now gathers dust in a . drawer. 'I'm a card carrying nerd, but this was one card too . many.' Glass now sells on eBay for as little as half list price. 'It's not a big enough platform to play on seriously,' said . Matthew Milan, founder of Toronto-based software firm Normative . Design, which put on hold a Glass app for logging exercise and . biking. Mobile game company Glu Mobile, known for its . popular 'Kim Kardashian: Hollywood' title, was one of the first . to launch a game on Glass. Spellista, a puzzler released a year . ago, is still available, but Glu has discontinued work on it, a . spokesman for the company said. Another developer, Sean McCracken, won $10,000 in a contest . last year for creating an aliens-themed video game for Glass, . Psyclops, but Google never put it on the official hub for Glass . apps, making it tougher to find. He has quit working on updates. Still, there are some enthusiastic developers. Cycling and . running app Strava finds Glass well-suited for its users, who . want real-time data on their workouts, said David Lorsch, vice . president of business development. And entrepreneur Jake . Steinerman said it is ideal for his company, DriveSafe, which . detects if people are falling asleep at the wheel. In April, Google launched the Glass at Work program to help . make the device useful for specific industries, such as . healthcare and manufacturing. So far the effort has resulted in . apps that are being tested or used at companies such as Boeing . and Yum Brands' Taco Bell.

"The number of immigrants to the UK has risen three-fold in 30 years, a new study showed today. More people have come to Britain than left every year since 1994, fuelling a rising population. The Office for National Statistics said the impact is 'felt across the UK economy', with most now moving from other countries in search of work. Net migration was at a relatively low level during the 1980s and early 1990s. Since 1994, it has been positive every year and rose sharply after 1997, the ONS said . The main reason for moving to the UK is to find work, followed by studying and joining family already here . The ONS released the new overview of the impact of immigration on Britain's population over the last 30 years. Immigration in 1980 was 173,000, which rose to 526,000 in 2013, hitting a peak of 596,000 in 2006. The study examined changes in net migration - the difference between the number of long-term immigrants coming to the UK and the number of emigrants leaving. In 1980, more people left than arrived, meaning net migration was negative at minus 55,000. But by 2013, more migrants were arriving than leaving, taking this figure up to 209,000. 'Over the last 20 years, net migration has been positive - increasing in magnitude in the late 1990s, and following the expansion of the EU during the 2000s,' the ONS said. 'More recently, as the UK economy recovers from the recent economic downturn, net migration has begun to increase once again - with work generally the most common reason for migrating here. 'The impact of migration can be felt across the UK economy and society in the composition of the population and labour force, and also through demand for public services and housing.' David Cameron pledged at the last election to cut net migration to the levels last seen in the 1990s. In 2011, he said this would happen by 2015, ‘no ifs, no buts’. But latest figures show 260,000 more people arrived in the UK than left in year to June, including a record 228,000 extra immigrants who arrived from elsewhere in the European Union. More immigrants to the UK are born outside the EU, but the number has fallen sharply in recent years . The ONS has published the new overview of the last three decades using previously published data. The sharp rise in immigration during the 2000s was driven by new countries joining the EU after 2004, including Poland. While this did show a decrease after the economic downturn in 2008, more recently, net migration of EU citizens has started to increase again, the ONS said. Net migration of non-EU citizens increased after 1997 and peaked in 2004 but declined sharply in 2005 and saw a further steady decrease between 2010 and 2013. However, latest estimates show an increase in net migration of non-EU citizens to 168,000 in the year ending June 2014. The total fertility rate for UK-born mothers is 1.79, compared to 2.17 for women born elsewhere . In 2004 there were 95,000 Poles living in the UK, but by 2013 this had increased to 679,000, an increase of 584,000 . Between 2009 and 2012, the most common reason for moving to the UK was to study, but in 2013 it was overtaken by coming for work. More detailed information shows that women born outside the UK have more children than Britons. The total fertility rate for UK-born mothers is 1.79, compared to 2.17 for women born elsewhere. The foreign populaiton of Britain has also changed. While India remains the most reported country of birth, the increase of 232,000 betwen 2004 and 2013 is much lower than other countries. For example, in 2004 there were 95,000 Poles living in the UK, but by 2013 this had increased to 679,000, an increase of 584,000, making it the second highest reported country of birth for non-UK born residents.","Immigration in 1980 was 173,000, which rose to 526,000 in 2013, study says .
In 1980, more people left than arrived, meaning net migration was -55,000 .
By 2013, more migrants were arriving than leaving, taking figure to 209,000 .
Sharp rise in immigration during the 2000s was driven by new EU countries ."
"A Washington state teenager who suffered life-long injuries when she was violently shaken as an infant has died, and a prosecutors' office said on Wednesday her biological father could be charged in her death. Baylee Duggins, 15, of Tacoma, died on Sunday from respiratory failure linked to pneumonia, according to her mother and the Pierce County Medical Examiner's Office. Her death was ruled a homicide, a result of being 'shaken as an infant,' the coroner's office said. Duggins' biological father, Christopher Schwanz, was convicted in 2000 of second-degree child abuse for shaking the girl as an infant, leaving her severely physically and mentally impaired, according to Pierce County court records. Homicide: Baylee Duggins, 15, of Tacoma, died Sunday from complications stemming from abuse she suffered as a child. Her mother, Shannon Stiles (left), wants Baylee's father to be charged . Disabled: Baylee never recovered from being shaken as a child, not being able to walk or talk . Birthday girl: Baylee and her mom Shannon are seen here at Baylee's 14th birthday party . He served about two years of his 46-month sentence. The Pierce County prosecutor's office was investigating the death and said on Wednesday that a decision on whether to bring a homicide charge against Schwanz would be made in coming days or weeks. Prosecutors were 'still gathering reports and information at this time,' a spokeswoman said, adding that law enforcement officials were also examining whether there was any statute of limitations that could prevent a new charge in the case. Duggins had been a normal, healthy baby before she was shaken, according to her mother, Shannon Stiles. The young girl spent her life confined to a wheelchair, was legally blind, and was never able to talk, she said. Baby girl: Baylee was born happy and healthy in 1999, but at three-months-old suffered serious head trauma after being shaken by her father . Precious: Baylee died Sunda,y nearly 15 years after she was violently shaken by her biological father . Fundraising: A GoFundMe page set up for Baylee's funeral expenses has raised over $3,000 . She underwent almost 20 surgeries over the course of her life, however her health took a steep decline in December. 'She was totally dependent,' Stiles said. 'And when she got sick, it was harder for her to heal.' Shaken baby syndrome, also known as abusive head trauma, is the leading cause of child abuse deaths in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At least one in four babies violently shaken dies, the CDC said. Those who survive are at risk for lifelong brain damage and other complications. Tragic: Baylee underwent nearly 20 surgeries and spent the 15 years of her life not being able to walk, tal, or do anything on her own . Shaken baby syndrome destroys a child's brain cells and prevents his or her brain from getting oxygen . Stiles said she wants prosecutors to bring murder charges against the child's father. 'I want justice for Baylee,' she said. 'That's what it needs to be. She could never fight for herself, so we have to fight for her,' Stiles said. Stiles added to KOMO News that she still blames for Schwanz for what happened to Baylee. 'If it wasn't for him hurting her, she would be able to do anything to that she wanted to do,' Stiles told the network. 'I'm hoping he has to pay for taking my daughter's life away.' Schwanz could not be reached for comment about his daughter's death or the possible new charges.","At three-months-old Baylee Duggins was shaken by her father .

"A former corrections officer has been arrested after he allegedly allowed a pair of exotic dancers to smuggle in contraband and have romantic relationships with prisoners under his watch. Randolph Blackwelder, 45, who resigned from Sumter Correctional Facility in Bushnell, Florida, has been charged with official misconduct after Jason Adams walked away from a five-man roadside work detail in September. Adams left the labor unit on State Road 54 in Lutz, Florida, and was discovered at a Tampa Greyhound bus station the next day. Blackwelder allegedly delayed his call to the sheriff's office alerting them to the escape to give Adams time to get away. Investigators say Blackwelder was in on the escape and 'basically allowed it [the unit] to be a party' by letting inmates have conjugal visits and leave whenever they wanted so they could get hold of alcohol and cigarettes. Scroll down for video . Smuggling ring: Randolph Blackwelder, 45, (left) a former prison guard in Bushnell, Florida, has been charged with official misconduct after Jason Adams (right) walked away from a five-man work detail in September . During their investigation, police discovered that the contraband was being carried inside the prisoner's rectums or had been packed into Scooby Snax spice packs. Exotic dancer Ann Petty, 46, who would give them contraband while they were under Blackwelder's supervision, is said to have been 'romantically involved' with several prisoners. Jessica Hope Morgan, 25, another part of the suspected smuggling ring, told officers she knew what she was doing was wrong, but carried on because she had 'fallen in love' with one of the inmates. The pair are being held accused of smuggling contraband into a state correctional facility. Blackwelder was also charged with official misconduct, unlawful compensation for official behavior and smuggling contraband into a state correctional facility. Pasco Sheriff Chris Nocco said that the group had been 'more play than work' - enjoying conjugal visits and beer drinking sessions in the woods. He told the Tampa Bay Times: 'Prison is supposed to be tough. He [Blackwelder] was allowing it to be basically a party out there.

Seized: Pasco Sheriff Chris Nocco, pictured with the confiscated contraband, said that the group had been 'more play than work' - enjoying conjugal visits and beer drinking sessions in the woods . Club: Petty and Morgan both worked at Calender Girls in Hudson, Florida. Morgan told investigators she knew what she was doing but carried on because she had 'fallen in love' with one of the prisoners . According to the Tampa Bay Times, Blackwelder several hours to tell anyone after Adams walked off. While he let the illicit operation continue under his watch, he reportedly received food, alcohol, tobacco and cash payments. Nocco added: 'We know when they went off, they were doing other things in the field. This guy was clearly not doing his job and was putting the safety of our citizens at risk.' Detective David Boyer said the seized contraband 'only scratches the surface' of what inmates had access to. He said: 'This stuff is unacceptable. You put this contraband in the hands of convicted felons that are sentenced to the Department of Corrections for serious, serious charges - attempted murder on law enforcement, attempted murder, serious theft and violent crimes - it's scary.' Blackwelder is being held on $40,000 bail. It was the second time that Adams had escaped in two weeks. The first time he visited a nearby gas station and bought four cans of beer and cigarettes - all of which he is believed to have planned to sell in prison.

"A cinema asked a disabled man to leave half way through a film and told him not to return on busy weekends because other customers found his life-saving ventilator too noisy. Richard Bridger was watching Taken 3 with his carer at the Odeon Cinema in Epsom, Surrey, when an employee approached the pair to ask them to leave 40 minutes into the film. The 31-year-old, whose Duchenne muscular dystrophy confines him to an electric wheelchair, was then told not to return on Saturday nights by the member of staff. Richard Bridger was thrown out of a cinema after viewers complained his ventilator was too loud. The 31-year-old (pictured with his father, Steve) has Duchenne muscular dystrophy . It came after six of the 200 people watching the film complained that Mr Bridger's ventilator was making too much noise. The incident was described as 'disgusting' by Mr Bridger's father who added the sound of his son's ventilator is no louder than that of rustling crisp packets and crunching popcorn. 'When we are at home we can watch a TV programme with it on, if he was texting or answering phone calls during the film I could understand it but he can't do any of those things because he doesn't have the physical strength to do them,' Steve Bridger said. 'Richard has been going to the cinema since it opened and, in the last four years, has required the use of the ventilator to keep his carbon dioxide levels down which can be life-threatening if they are raised too high. 'All he wanted to do was go out and watch a film and it takes a lot of organisation to arrange for Richard to go out. 'I find it disgusting that, in this age, a person who is mentally capable - Richard has 14 GCSEs and a degree - but relies on life-saving equipment, should be treated in this way. 'This is total discrimination. Odeon doesn’t take disability seriously enough.' While Mr Bridger's ventilator makes some noise, it is no worse than the sound of rustling crisp packets of crunching popcorn, his father said . The Odeon in Epsom, Surrey, where Mr Bridger was asked to leave. A spokesman for the cinema chain has since apologised for the incident . Outraged, Mr Bridger visited the cinema to complain but was told by the general manager that the right decision had been made. Disabled rights campaigners described Mr Bridger's treatment as 'rude' and 'discriminatory', adding that those bothered by the sound of the ventilator could have moved seats. 'Due to his Duchenne muscular dystrophy, he often needs a ventilator to breathe,' said Victoria Wright Campaigns Officer for the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign Trailblazers. 'If the noise unfortunately disturbed other customers, then you would hope they would make the compassionate choice to move seats. 'Richard, on the other hand, has no choice but to use his ventilator to breathe. 'To remove Richard from the cinema and imply he can only come at certain, less popular times because of his disability, was insensitive and discriminatory. 'To talk to his carer instead of him directly was also extremely rude.' A spokesman for Odeon said: 'We sincerely apologise for the way this matter was handled and for the upset it caused. 'We are inviting Mr Bridger and his son to return and enjoy Taken 3 at any time as guests of Odeon Epsom. 'We are also looking again at what happened to ensure it never happens again.'","Richard Bridger has Duchenne muscular dystrophy and needs a ventilator .

"Mother-of-two Caroline Bryon, 34, stole £50,000 in welfare handouts by making false childcare claims, pictured at Manchester Crown Court yesterday . A child tax credit inspector stole £50,000 in welfare handouts by making bogus childcare claims to pay off a 4,000 per cent interest Wonga debt. Mother-of-two Caroline Bryon, 34, from Greater Manchester, swindled the money over four years and thought she could avoid detection as she knew only a certain number of claims were checked. She was unmasked as a fraudster and has now been given a 14-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and was ordered to pay just £100 to cover court costs. The inland revenue officer was in debt due to her love of socialising and illegally pocketed double the child tax credits and working tax credits she was entitled to when she moved in with a partner who had a full-time job. She began spinning three different lies to obtain the cash from 2010 even tried to involve a babysitter in the scam when she realised she was under investigation, Manchester Crown Court heard. Bryon narrowly avoided immediate custody on the basis that she didn't use her job to obtain the cash - because 'if she had applied her mind she would have realised she was always going to get found out'. The mother who has two sons aged 10 and five was working in Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs office checking other benefits claims during the four years from 2010 to 2014. Prosecutor Jonathan Rogers said Bryon began submitting claims saying her circumstances were correct when they had, in fact, changed. He said: 'In January 2011 she telephoned HMRC to say her child care costs were £300 per week. This was while she worked for the HMRC processing and checking claims. 'One of the childcare providers cites the defendant, knowing there was an investigation into her claim, had asked her to tell tax credits that she had paid the childminder almost double what she had and asked her to backdate a claim but the childminder refused. 'The defendant had a greater knowledge than average members of the public on the street would have. She would know what checks took place because she carried them out herself.' Bryon claimed she had taken out a payday loan with Wonga - only to be left facing interest rates of 4,000 per cent. Defence counsel Andrew Evans said: 'It stems from debt. The name Wonga appears. Interest rates of 4,000%. It was a debt spiral. She separated from the father of her eldest child and decided to use payday loans to bridge the gap, not only her own outgoings but socialising. She began spinning three different lies to obtain the cash from 2010 even tried to involve a babysitter in the scam when she realised she was under investigation, Manchester Crown Court heard (pictured) 'What she has realised is this is a problem with alcohol that she uses in periods of stress. The stress was she was going to move from home and away from her family and from Lancashire to Manchester to move in with her new partner. 'She had been hiding this debt. She will be a very unlikely candidate to darken the court's door again. She has paid off huge interest rates to those people who prey on people in crisis.' Judge Andrew Thomas said Bryon had 'lived beyond her means' and had cheated hard-working taxpayers. He said: 'There came a point when you positively told lies in applications you made. The offending involves lies told over a period of two years but the claims persisted for five years. I regard it as a significant aggravating factor that you were employed by HMRC throughout the period, carrying out work processing tax credit claims yourself. 'I recognise you didn't use this position in order to interfere with your own claim. You of all people know what the system is. You of all people know that our revenue system, both payment of taxes and payment of benefits, depends on trust. 'People in your position know that we rely on the honesty of people submitting their forms when you process payments and you know the proportion of forms routinely checked. We all know those who cheat the system aren't cheating the State, you are cheating all honest people who work hard and pay taxes and don't claim benefits to which they aren't entitled. 'You were cheating your own colleagues, friends and neighbours by stealing in that way. This is a case of someone who lived beyond their means and got into debt for that reason.' Bryon from Ashton-under-Lyne was also given 200 hours unpaid work and ordered to undergo six months of supervision after pleading guilty to four counts of fraud by false representation.","Caroline Bryon stole £50,000 in welfare handouts over four years from 2010 .

"Life in prison: Gregory Scott Hale was sentenced to life in prison on Thursday for a gruesome murder . A Tennessee man who told police he ate part of his victim's body has been sentenced to life in prison without parole after pleading guilty in the woman's death. Coffee Circuit Judge Craig Johnson sentenced 37-year-old Gregory Scott Hale of Summitville on Thursday. The Tullahoma News said Hale pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in the June 8 death of 36-year-old Lisa Marie Hyder. Prosecutors say Hale picked Hyder up at a liquor store and took her to his residence, killing her after sex. They say he told investigators that he was fulfilling an obsession. He also admitted to eating a part of the victim. 'He told investigators that he fulfilled an obsession in wanting to kill a person and dismembering them,' Coffee County District Attorney Craig Northcott told Circuit Court Judge Craig Johnson Thursday. Coffee County District Attorney Craig Northcott said officers discovered a burned torso with hands, feet and head cut off and found in buckets. Hale's attorney, Kevin Askren, didn't immediately return a call. Hyder’s former husband Charles Hyder said he and his children 'forgave Hale' for killing her then dismembering her. Hyder told The Tullahoma News that he was happy with the plea agreement. 'Lisa and I were married for six years and had two children, a 4-year old and a 6-year old,' Hyder said. Dismembered and eaten: Coffee County District Attorney Craig Northcott said officers discovered a burned torso with hands, feet and head cut off and found in buckets that belonged to Lisa Marie Hyder . Satanic worshiper: Hale's Facebook was filled with images of him praising satanic worship and he was once fired from a meat processing plant after the boss caught Hale stealing eyeballs . The house: Prosecutors say Hale picked Hyder up at a liquor store and took her to his residence, killing her after sex and dismembering her then eating her . 'The children are too young to understand what has happened so I just told them that mama got sick and she has gone to live with God.' Hyder's father Billy Poore told the court that he could not forgive hale 'at this time.' 'I will never have her back,' Poore said. 'May God have mercy on him.' Poore said that one of his younger daughters is haunted by her eldest sister's death and is having terrible nightmares. She has two sisters and a brother who live in Ohio and they have to try and cope with not having her with them anymore. 'He is an animal and needs to be put away and never get out,' Poore said. 'I cannot forgive him.' According to Lisa Hyder's ex-husband this summer, Charles Hyder, the mother of their six children had struggled with alcoholism and was recently diagnosed with ovarian cancer, WZTV reported.

Openly sisister: Gregory Scott Hale would write comments on his Facebook alluding to digging peoples graves and he would paint his face and give intimidating glances . Cancer stricken: The victim suffered from ovarian cancer and alcoholism and was a mother of two . The woman lived in a Chattanooga suburb and worked in a store selling spirits in Manchester, where on Friday afternoon she ran into Gregory Hale. At around 2.30pm, she called her ex-husband asking to pick her up, but he said he was in another town. He told her to wait for him, but when Mr Hyder returned home two hours later and called Lisa back, her phone was not answering. Charles Hyder said he spent the weekend trying to reach his ex-wife so their children, the youngest of them just a year old, could talk to her like they did every day, but he could not get a hold of her. ‘I still blame myself because I didn't go get her, but I was down in Huntsville unloading my truck, and I wished I could have been there a little bit faster,’ Hyder said. ‘Usually I rescue her every time something goes wrong.’ ‘My daughter was mangled, butchered and chopped up like a liver. There's nothing left,’ her heartbroken father, Billy Poore, told the station WAAY. A clearer picture also has begun to emerge of the suspected killer and cannibal, Gregory Hale. The 37-year-old was known among his neighbors and acquaintances as a devil worshiper. He was reportedly fired from a meat processing plant after the owner caught him performing a satanic ritual. The proprietor of the slaughterhouse recalled that Hale would often take animal bones and eyeballs home with him. His Facebook page is filled with disturbing, sexually explicit and grisly images, as well as references to cannibalism and Scandinavian mythology. Changing looks: In one photo Hale apperas to be a gentleman but his style changed throughout his life . 'Would tha vegetarian taste like that fake soy meat like they got in sum fast food places???' he wrote in April. According to his social media account, the 37-year-old has a girlfriend and a teenage son named after a Norse god. Some of Hale's selfies depict him brandishing weapons, including a large steel machete, or cradling snakes. The 37-year-old also shared an image that featured a line of text that read: 'I hug the people I hate so I know how big to dig their hole in my backyard.' Coffee County District Attorney Mickey Layne said Hale was apprehended at his home late Sunday after a neighbor told police he'd had a conversation with the 37-year-old and had reason to believe a homicide had been committed. When officers arrived at the home, Layne said they found human remains on the grounds. They then questioned Hale and took him into custody. Food for snakes and cannibals: Hale kept snakes along with dismembered body parts at his residence . Hale has an attorney and is being held in jail on $1.5million bond. His next court date is June 23. Detectives believe the gruesome murder took place inside Hale's rural home on Pete Sain Road in Manchester Friday. According to Hale's arrest affidavit, the suspect admitted to killing Lisa Hyder and then disposing of her body by beheading the victim and chopping off her hands and feet. Officers who responded to Hale's residence after receiving a tip found at least two plastic buckets filled with human remains. Hale buried the victim's torso in a burn pile on his property and consumed a part of the corpse, the document stated. Following his arrest, Hale told police he and Hyder did not know each other until they met in Manchester and went to the man's home, Times Free Press reported. The two were sitting around the fire and talking when the 37-year-old allegedly attacked and killed Hyder.

"A Michigan woman who has been charged with murdering her newborn daughter gave birth again just weeks ago - and no can find her child. Melissa Mitin of Okemos, Michigan is awaiting trial after an incident on December 26, 2013 in which she allegedly gave birth to a daughter in the bathroom of a family friend's home, and then immediately stuffed the crying child in a trash can. Now, it has been revealed she gave again birth just three weeks while she was out on bail, and she will not tell authorities where they can find her newborn son - this as a dead baby was found in a nearby dumpster. Scroll down for video . Melissa Mitin (above) is charged with the murder of her newborn daughter in December 2013, and while out on bail she gave birth to a son it has been revealed, whose location she claims to be unaware of . Mitin stuffed the newborn in a waste basket (above) and the left it in a bathroom at a family friend's home . The Lansing State Journal reports that when Mitin was asked about where her son was by a family court judge earlier this week she said she 'could not recall.' Mitin has now had her bail revoked and her attorney wants to test to see if she is competent to stand trial . Ingham County Assistant Prosecutor Debra Rousseau responded to this by saying; 'If that is true then she has some major psychological issues.' Prosecutors believe that Mitin became pregnant with this second child just three months after her daughter was found face-down in a wastebasket. Mitin, 25, reportedly left the child there after the incident with her parents finding the baby girl. According to her mother, Mitin said she was raped. Both parents testified they knew nothing of the pregnancy and were against premarital sex for religious reasons and had never talked about the act with their daughter. It seems that Mitin was receiving regular checkups for this new pregnancy until 35 weeks, and then stopped showing up. Rousseasu claims that Mitin told the doctor's office 'she didn't return because she already had given birth,' at which point they notified Child Protective Services. It is unknown who the father of this second baby is, and the father of the first was a student who attended Michigan State University with Mitin and is now living in another country. Mitin had recently been  living with her parents at their Okemos home while working on a master's degree in kinesiology at Michigan State University. Now, Mitin has had her bail in the first murder case revoked, and is undergoing tests to see if she is even competent to stand trial. 'I have some serious concerns about her psychological well-being,' said her attorney, Dennis Reynolds. On Thursday evening, a report came in of a dead baby boy found nearby at a recycling center in Roseville. The baby had no visible signs of trauma and was believed to be just three days old when he was killed. Detectives are investigating a possible link between Mitin and the child.","Melissa Mitin of Okemo, Michigan is out on bail and awaiting trial after being charged with murdering her newborn daughter in December 2013 .

"Tennis ace Victoria Azarenka has candidly opened up about her battle with depression following her split from music star Redfoo. After two years and a series of engagement rumours, the 25-year-old parted ways with Redfoo in June 2014 and her career took a nosedive. Azarenka, from Belarus in Eastern Europe, said she was left broken-hearted when she split from X Factor Australia judge Redfoo and turned to the unlikely hobby of painting to get her through the tough times, she told the New York Times. Scroll down for video . Tennis ace Victoria Azarenka (pictured at Hozier Lane in Melbourne) has candidly opened up about her battle with depression following her split from music star Redfoo. A foot and knee injury restricted the tennis star to only 24 matches in 2014 leading to a disaster year, both professionally and romantically. 'I did get my heart broken; I really did. I'm over it, but it was broken. And I'm not afraid to admit that it was, but it's life,' she said. 'I think the toughest part is to admit that you weren't O.K. Somebody asked me at one stage, 'Are you depressed?' And I said: 'Are you kidding me? I'm not depressed.' But you know what? I was. I was, but I just didn't realize it, because all these things happen, and you just don't know how to deal with emotions.' After two years and a series of engagement rumours, the 25-year-old Belarusian athlete parted ways with Redfoo in June 2014 and her career took a nosedive . Azarenka, who admits that she cried a lot last year, was hitting rock-bottom and was searching for a new hobby to take her mind off her troubles. With her mother being a professional painter, it was only right that she would try her hand at the brush and before she knew it she was getting compliments on her work. She started crying during her first painting class and threw the brush down. Using her hands, she smeared the paint across her shirt, creating what she thought was a mess. 'I was upset, and I was lazy, and I just wiped my hands on my shirt, just everything on my shirt, on my pants. And I woke up the next day and had a meeting in this restaurant with Nike people, and I didn't feel like dressing up. I just put on that shirt and those pants, and I come into the restaurant. And the Nike people, they're like: 'Oh my God, that's a cool shirt. Where did you buy it?' ' she said. Speaking to the New York Times , Azarenka said she was left broken-hearted when she split from X Factor Australia judge Redfoo and turned to an unlikely hobby to get her through the tough times . Azarenka is pictured in Hozier Lane in Melbourne. The tennis star had a disaster year in 2014 . Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, Azarenka said painting is all about expressing yourself and felt it was a great outlet for her at the time. 'I don't consider myself as a great painter; I just feel that art is about expressing your emotions and expressing your feelings, and music is the same way, you can see what other people are going through. If you listen to some songs, I never understood some of the lyrics, and then I was like 'oh my God, this is what I'm going through! Did you write it for me'?' Azarenka reveals that she found a shoulder to cry on in good friend and fellow tennis star Caroline Wozniacki. Wozniacki had just been jilted by golfer Rory McIlroy when Azarenka and Redfoo called quits on their relationship and she was also feeling the strain of her personal problems. Azarenka, who admits that she cried a lot last year, was hitting rock-bottom and was searching for a new hobby to take her mind off her troubles. With her mother being a professional painter, it was only right that she would try her hand at the brush and before she knew it she was getting compliments on her work . Redfoo and Azarenka were together for two-years before they split, They are pictured here at Madison Square Garden in 2013 . 'We were both in Monaco when her situation happened and everything with me happened, and we were just having dinner and crying on each other's shoulders.' The young star said she has never looked at the official numbers and does not take any heed of where she ranks on the world table in tennis, despite having only made one final last year and ending her season with a loss in Tokyo. 2015 kicked off with a disappointing loss for Azarenka at the Brisbane International before a tough training week at Melbourne Park. However Azareka is set to come back fighting this year for the Australian Open in January. The young star (pictured at Hozier Lane in Melbourne) said she has never looked at the official numbers and does not take any heed of where she ranks on the world table in tennis, despite having only made one final last year and ending her season with a loss in Tokyo .","Tennis ace Victoria Azarenka has opened up about her split with singer Redfoo .

"A mere 24 hours after it launched, the website which allows you to send angry notes and glitter to your enemies, is now up for sale. The new company, founded by 22-year-old Sydneysider Matthew Carpenter, promised the public that immature pranks were the best solution and pioneered the genius idea. However, he has now put ShipYourEnemiesGlitter.com up for sale, claiming he has already made a five-figure sum and is ready to let someone else take over. Scroll down for video . 22-year-old Sydneysider Matthew Carpenter has announced that he is selling his young company ShipYourEnemiesGlitter after he received an unprecedented amount of orders . Taking to his Twitter and Facebook accounts, Carpenter announced his retirement from the young company and publicly put it up for sale, hinting he is overwhelmed by the amount of orders the company has received. 'ShipYourEnemiesGlitter with 1m visits, 270k social shares, $xx,xxx in sales, tonnes of people wanting to order. 24 hours old. For sale.' his post said. The news may not come as a much of a surprise to some, after Carpenter previously admitted that 'he hates glitter.' Carpenter is the genius behind the innovative idead, which went viral worldwide within hours . The next big thing: ShipYourEnemiesGlitter.com promises to send an envelope full of glitter to your enemies . 'I'm a 22 year old dude that has too much free time apparently because now my plans for the next few weeks will consist of sending stupid glitter to terrible people,' Carpenter told Daily Mail Australia. 'People call it the herpes of the craft world,' the website said. 'Pay us money, provide an address anywhere in the world and we'll send them so much glitter in an envelope that they'll be finding it everywhere for weeks.' The website was launched on Tuesday night and went viral worldwide within hours. 'The website is just over 24 hours old. We've had over 1.3m visits, 250k social shares so the response has been pretty intense,' said Carpenter. Part  of the appeal is that each package will be individually 'wrapped with hate' by Carpenter himself for the incredibly low price of $9.99 per envelope. An illustration on the website demonstrates the extreme frustration your enemy will experience when they receive an envelope packed with glitter . The hateful envelopes may seem harmless, with some people on Social Media expressing confusion at the concept due to their personal love of glitter. However, the frustration felt when covered with seemingly endless pieces of glitter cannot be fully understood unless one has experienced the twinkly torture. It sticks to clothes, skin, hair and furniture and somehow has the creepy ability to pop up when least expected for weeks after the glitter ambush. So why should someone use this website to send the sparkly packages? The website founders explain that packaging the envelopes is an extremely messy process. People who use the service can now cause the maximum amount of irritation to their enemy without any personal pain. Although many people may think glitter is 'fun', they are wrong as it can be used as a harmless but intensely irritating torture . 'We're making a heroic sacrifice. (Glitter) gets all over our working space,' the ShipYourEnemiesGlitter team explain. 'You can do it yourself if you want. But then you have to handle the glitter, making your own house full of glitter.' These envelopes from hell, known in some circles as 'glitter bombs', are the perfect form of anonymous vengeance which the website promises to do for the bargain price of $9.99. The website even generously gives the option of including a hateful note in the envelope to really hammer the message home. The unique commercial endeavour has paid off as just hours after launching the website was forced to suspend purchases. 'You guys have a sick obsession with shipping people glitter,' Carpenter explained. Although some believe the website is just a gag, the administrators promise the company is real, explaining 'we spent too much time, money and resources putting this... website up to not get paid for it.' Rave reviews, as well as complaints from unhappy envelope recipients, indicate the product's effectiveness . The glitter will stick to every possible surface of the recipient's body and home and will continually and inexplicably appear for weeks after the ambush . The way it works is simple. When on the website, 'click the buy button. Decide whose day you want to ruin and then enter their address.' The website already has glowing reviews from thrilled customers, including gleeful Grady Chambers: . 'I bought this for my husband, he opened the mail before work & got it everywhere! He had to change, was late for work and might be getting fired, LOL!' However, Alma Henry warned people to not underestimate the power of glitter. 'For my one year anniversary I didn't know what to get my wife, so I bought this thinking it would be funny. 'It wasn't, I'm now divorced, broke and living with my best friend. I'd like to talk with the owner to get a refund and discuss damages.' The website has a helpful FAQ section, although they point out 'Yes, somehow we do have Frequently Asked Questions' A thrilled customer wrote a reference, explaining ''I bought this for my husband, he opened the mail before work & got it everywhere! He had to change, was late for work and might be getting fired, LOL!'","24 hours after it was launched, ShipYourEnemiesGlitter.com is up for sale .

"Prime Minister David Cameron has been hosted at the White House for a working dinner with President Barack Obama, where the two leaders were expected to discuss economic growth, trade and security. Mr Cameron arrived at the White House late last night after having spent his first day in Washington meeting with Christine Lagarde, director of the International Monetary Fund. Mr Obama greeted him in the Oval Office before the two walked together into the presidential residence to begin their discussions. Scroll down for video . David Cameron and Barack Obama make their way from the Oval Office to the Residence to begin their working dinner . The pair appeared to be in good spirits as they chatted before settling down to business . Mr Cameron and Mr Obama are pictured inside the Oval Office moments after the Prime Minister was invited inside . It was revealed today a cyber cell of British and American intelligence and security agents is being created to defeat online attacks in an 'unprecedented' deal to be struck by Mr Cameron and the President. Mr Obama is toughening up the American response in the wake of the embarrassing and damaging North Korean hack on Sony Pictures and the infiltration of Pentagon Twitter and YouTube sites. Ahead of tonight's working dinner, Mr Cameron warned of the increasing threat of cyber attacks. 'This is an evolving threat which poses a real risk to our businesses and that's why we're taking our cooperation with the US to an unprecedented level. This is about pooling our effort so we stay one step ahead of those who seek to attack us. The leaders' discussions were undertaken last night during a 'working dinner'. Judging by the menu, it looks to have been one of Mr Cameron's more enjoyable duties. 'The joint exercises and training of our next generation of cyber experts will help to ensure that we have the capability we need to protect critical sectors like our energy, transport and financial infrastructure from emerging threats.' Under the plans GCHQ and MI5 will join forces with NSA and FBI to turn an American cyber cell into a transatlantic operation, to improve information sharing about threats. The Prime Minister's two-day trip to Washington appears to have started well - earlier in the day Miss Lagarde lavished him with praise for Britain's role in leading the world in economic growth. However, their leaders' meeting comes amid heightened fears about terrorism in Europe and the West after last week's terrorist attacks in France, in which 17 people were slain. Cyber-terrorism and surveillance will be central issues at the visit, which Tory strategists hope will be a pre-election ‘love-in’ between Mr Cameron and Mr Obama and boost the Prime Minister’s standing at home. Unusually, the President has agreed to host Mr Cameron close to an election, apparently repaying the favour Mr Cameron made by visiting the US and all but endorsing him during the last presidential race.","The leaders met at the White House last night to discuss range of issues .

"From Kalashnikovs and AK47s, to dynamite and tear gas, this shocking image reveals the staggering arsenal accumulated by kosher deli killer Amedy Coulibaly before his deadly attack in Paris last week. The hostage-taker, who gunned down a police officer before shooting dead four people in a Paris supermarket last week, assembled his cache of deadly weapons at a hideout in the Parisian suburb of Gentilly, along with the black flags of ISIS, ammunition, and several IDs. The militant Islamist's final hide-out was raised by police last Saturday and investigators are now hunting a fourth 'accomplice' whose traces were found at the second floor apartment. Scroll down for video . Kalashnikovs, Ak47s, dynamite and tear gas, among the cache of weapons found at the home of deli killer Amedy Coulibaly . Coulibaly was married to Hayat Boumeddiene, another 26-year-old Islamic fanatic, who is thought to have helped mastermind the bloody slaughter which left 20 dead, including the three terrorists, around Paris last week. She then fled to Syria . The Islamic fundamentalist disowned his own parents as far back as 2010 as he begun a spiralling descent into radical Islam, police wiretaps reveal. The French Muslim was arrested in May of that year for his part in a plot to free a convicted terrorist from prison. Prosecution documents obtained by MailOnline, show that even then Coulibaly had turned his back on his family because of ‘their kaffir ways’. 'Kaffirs' are Muslims who are regarded as having rejected the Qaran. The documents also suggest that the Muslim of Malian origin may have already been flirting with the idea of martyrdom, as he was recordeded asking what would happen to his debts when he died. Amedy Coulibaly, who gunned down a police officer before shooting dead four people in a Paris supermarket last week . And a psychiatric evaluation at the time revealed that the future killer even then had ‘psychopathic tendencies.’ Interviews with his terror-fixer wife Hayat Boumedienne, published earlier this week, revealed that Coulibaly was already making frequent visits to a suspected terror training camp in France. The alleged camp, where Boumedienne was photographed firing a crossbow in full burkha, was run by Djamel Beghal alias Abou Hamza, himself a disciple of reviled London hate preacher Abu Hamza. The cache of new documents record how Coulibaly boasted to his mentor that he had fully rejected his family in favour of a complete devotion to militant Islam. In police wire taps, the French Muslim, a trained electronic audio visual installer, related how he had ‘disowned his parents’ whom he was disgusted with because of their more relaxed interpretation of their faith. In the interceptions Coulibaly relayed to Hamza how he flew into a furious rage with his sisters when they asked him for help with their children because he did not believe that they were being raised as proper Muslims. Attack: CCTV from the kosher supermarket show Amedy Coulibaly and the hostages during the seige . He refused to help and said: ‘I banged my fist on the table and said “Listen to me all of you who are here, who don’t teach their child to pray and stuff like that, there’s no point calling me, I won’t give a Euro for the child, I will do nothing at all for it’ He added: ‘I said for me that’s how things are. For me, religion comes first, I don’t give a sh*t about the family.’ Coulibaly and Abou Hamza were recorded talking with Smaïn Ait Ali Belkahem, who was convicted of involvement in the 1995 Paris subway attacks, according to the prosecution documents. They discussed a project that would take time because it would be ‘on a grand scale’. The documents emerged as two more youths from the same Paris suburb as terrorist Amedy Coulibaly were arrested after a policewoman guarding the Elysee Palace was ‘deliberately run over’. CCTV images showing Coulibaly's common-law wife Hayat Boumeddiene entering Turkey through an Istanbul airport a week before her partner killed four hostages in a Kosher grocery store in Paris . The officer, who is in hospital, said the 19-year-old driver looked into her eyes as he drove into her, flinging her across the bonnet. She suffered injuries to the wrists, arms and back. There were a series of similar attacks across France before Christmas, with drivers said to be shouting Islamic slogans as they drove into crowds, and tried to ram down police. It came as French Interior Minister Manuel Valls placed an extra 10,000 troops on the streets of France and warned: ‘We are at war’. He also confirmed that there were ‘without doubt’ accomplices to the Paris attack, saying ‘the hunt will go on to find them’. Hundreds of thousands of the controversial copies of the ‘survival edition’ of Charlie Hebdo appeared in kiosks and newsagents across France again today, but most were sold out by 7am.","Paris deli killer Amedy Coulibaly accumulated a deadly arsenal at his home .

"The mother of a beggar raking in money  by using a chip and pin machine to target celebrities and millionaires described her son as a 'survivor,'  it has been reported. Damien Preston-Booth, who is on benefits, has the portable card reader to accept donations because the rich 'don't carry much cash.' The 37-year-old, who claims to be homeless, has enjoyed holidays in Paris, Ibiza, Bruges and Monaco in the last year after camping outside upmarket nightclubs and restaurants in London's Mayfair. His mother Elaine Hart, 54, who is also on benefits after losing her job as a cleaner, praised her son for using the chip and pin machine,The Sun reported. 'Fair play to him,' the mum-of-three from Salford, Manchester, reportedly  told the newspaper. 'He seems to have grown up like me and is a survivor. No one would think to use a card machine as a beggar so good on him.' On his Facebook page Mr Preston-Booth posted a picture of himself with music mogul Simon Cowell in the West End with the caption: 'Simon didn't give me 50 pounds it was 20'. Professional beggar: Damien Preston-Booth, 37, commutes from Preston to London to beg in Mayfair and is pictured here taking money from Simon Cowell and offering him a sweet in return . Celebrities: Mr Preston-Booth is pictured here with Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh outside a Mayfair club . Defence: Mr Preston-Booth said that the music mogul gave him £20 and he has also admitted he has a chip and pin card reader for 'regulars' Mr Preston-Booth travels by bus, train or rental car from Preston in Lancashire to Mayfair and spends Thursdays to Sundays taking cash from passers-by and card payments from 'regulars'. He was last seen in the area over Christmas and New Year, local businesses have said. He usually finds a spot outside a Lebanese restaurant but is said to book into a nearby hotel if the weather is inclement. Upset: A friend claims the beggar, pictured in Spain, is 'taking everyone for a ride' and made around £4,500 over the New Year period - including £1,000 from a rich Arab outside the Dorchester Hotel . Using the cash he has travelled to  Monaco, Paris, Ibiza and Bruges in the past six months. A friend claims he is 'taking everyone for a ride' and made around £4,500 over the New Year period - including £1,000 from a rich Arab outside the Dorchester Hotel. The 37-year-old is renting a £300-a-month flat but appears to have been saying he has been homeless for five years. Mr Preston-Booth is also believed to be on Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) for his depression, which could earn him up to £108 a week. It is now likely he will face a benefit fraud investigation, a Government source told MailOnline. Mr Preston-Booth has been contacted for comment by MailOnline. Other beggars have said that they are 'scared' of Mr Preston-Booth, who denies he is a bully and claims he gives cash to others on the streets. His Facebook profile shows he has been flying all over Europe since the summer and he told online friends he had a 'great year'. In  July pictures show he spent time in Ibiza and came home to the UK via Paris. A month later he spent some time in Monaco. Mr Preston-Booth says he is £100-a-fortnight in benefits for depression and denies he is pocketing thousands from his begging activities. He told James Mills from The Sun: 'I'm saving up for a little flat and I'm trying to get a CV together so I can get a job. 'I have nothing to hide. I've been homeless and I did beg while I was in London and I have been down since I got my flat in October. I do it to buy things for the flat — not like smackheads who spend it on drugs and beers'. He said his trips abroad were to look for work and he slept rough and got his chip and pin reader when he was selling the Big Issue. His main haunt appears to be the Mamounia Lounge on Curzon Street - a hotspot for the rich and famous. Chief porter Emil Staykov, 45, told the Evening Standard said: 'That guy is really arrogant. He asks our customers for money as they go in and then sleeps in the doorway. 'I have called the police on him loads of times and have been tempted just to throw him out myself. I knew he had money, he always had two phones. 'He was horrible to the restaurant staff but would then be all smiles and jokes with the customers so they gave him money. That is a guy I do not like. We do not want him back'. Well travelled:Mr Preston-Booth has spent time in Ibiza, left, and in Paris, right, in the past six months . Jetting off: The beggar was pictured here at Stansted last year but said his trips abroad were to find work . New home: The beggar says his begging helps him by things for his new £300-a-month flat . Yesterday The Sun said he bought himself a coffee machine, a bathroom cabinet and a plug in grill with more than £100 in total for his new flat. Friends defended him today and one said: 'Everybody has to earn a living damo. There's no judgement here pal'. A female friend told him in an online message: 'You're brill Damien' and another said: 'Damien, you are a legend!' Mayfair business owners alleged Damien Preston-Booth would even arrive in his car before pounding the streets pretending to be disabled to rake in thousands of pounds on the streets of Mayfair. Damien Preston-Booth, 37, is believed to be on Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) for his depression, which could earn him up to £108 a week. The Government allows ESA to be paid to people of working age who are too ill to work because of a health condition or disability. You must be under state pension age, not getting statutory sick pay or statutory maternity pay and not receiving any jobseeker's allowance. In order to qualify you will have be assessed and after that can earn another £104 a week on top of your benefits for certain types of work. But Mr Preston-Booth's  begging - which is illegal in Britain and punishable by a £1,000 fine - could be considered benefit fraud. The Department for Work and Pensions told MailOnline it never comments on individual cases. However a spokesman said: 'Benefit fraud is a crime and our fraud investigaters will look into all suspected cases. 'If you suspect someone of claiming benefits fraudulently you can report it to the Benefit Fraud Hotline on National Benefit Fraud Hotline 0800 854 440'. Manager Emile Salame said: 'He's a clever man – he speaks to the tourists with a bit of French, Spanish or Arabic. 'When the Arabs come over in the summer he says hello to them in Arabic and gets some money. I've seen some of those guys give him £50 at a time. 'I did wonder if he is homeless. He has two or three phones, an iPad, a camera. We see him outside every night but we've not seen him since last week. He's always on the move but he stays in this area. 'As a homeless man I don't think he should be doing that with the card machine. He told me it was given to him by the Big Issue. 'We've given him sandwiches and hot drinks before but we've had to get the police to move him on from sleeping right outside the restaurant. 'He drives a car though and one morning I even saw him arrive and get coffee out of the back of his car for some police officers. 'I don't think it's fair what he is doing. We all work hard and pay taxes and it pays to help out the genuine homeless people. 'I've seen him acting up and hobbling down the road before and pretending to be disabled, even though there is nothing wrong with him. 'And he dresses up for the occasion, so at Christmas he was wearing a Santa outfit. He's a real entrepreneur, he's making a real business out of it.' Police are looking to ban a fraudulent beggar from Mayfair. Local businesses have grown fed-up with his behaviour and now police are urging them to put their complaints in writing to help them secure a ban against him. The 37-year-old was moved on by officers after allegedly harassing a customer at Noura on December 20. Mr Salame received a note from local officers asking him to fill out a business impact statement to help them apply for a criminal behaviour order against Preston-Booth that would prevent him from operating in the area. He said: 'We are in the process of putting together everything in writing. It is not fair when we are trying to run a business and he is simply irritating customers. 'He was harrassing one of the female customers sitting outside, he was insisting on sitting with her and it wasn't really on. 'We called the police and we have an ongoing thing with them about harassment. He's a naughty person, he should be more respectful, especially with what he gets out of the area.'","Damien Preston-Booth commutes from Preston to London to beg for cash .

The multi-layered barrier, which will eventually stretch across the Saudi-Iraq border from Jordan to Kuwait, includes 78 monitoring towers, eight command centres, 10 mobile surveillance vehicles, 32 rapid-response centres, and three rapid intervention squads, reports Janes.com. Citing a promotional video, the defence industry magazine reported the six-mile-deep barrier consists of a ditch, two fences and a patrol road connecting the watchtowers and guard rooms. The video included footage of thermal imagers and battlefield radar systems that can detect individuals at up to 12 miles away and vehicles at up to 24 miles away. Islamic State sees Saudi Arabia's links to the West as a betrayal of Islam and has called for 'lone-wolf' attacks against Saudi security forces, the Shi'ite Muslim minority and foreigners. Saudi forces have joined U.S.-led air strikes against Islamic State positions in Syria and mobilised conservative Sunni clergy to describe the ideology of the al Qaeda offshoot as deviant. Expansion of the Islamic State could turn into an existential struggle for the Saudi regime, which many hardline Islamists see as decadent and corrupt. A key goal of jihadists is the ultimate capture of Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam and home to the Two Holy Mosques of Mecca and Medina. Tragic: A picture released by the Saudi Press Agency shows a cleric and mourners praying in the holy mosque in Mecca during the funeral of three Saudi guards killed in an attack on the kingdom's border . Relations between Iraq and Saudi Arabia have already been deeply strained. Riyadh has accused former Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki of creating the conditions for the jihadist insurgency in his country by marginalising its Sunni Arab minority. Maliki in turn has accused the oil-rich kingdom of supporting 'terrorism' in Shi'ite-majority Iraq. Three of the four killed in last week's raid were Saudi nationals who local media described as members of the 'deviant group', a phrase authorities use to describe Al Qaeda. Three more Saudi nationals and four Syrians have since been arrested in Saudi Arabia in connection with the attack.","The capture of the Holy Mosques at Medina and Mecca is a key IS objective .

"A man who allegedly raped a teenage girl after picking her up in his car and refusing to let her out despite her pleas for him to 'stop being a creep' was out on bail for drugs charges. Police say the 15-year-old girl was walking along Darlinghurst Road in Sydney's Potts Point with a male friend on the night of December 8 when Saad Ahmed Khan, 39, drove up to the pair and offered them a lift about 11pm. The pair, who had earlier been at the Wayside Chapel, accepted the lift. A man allegedly raped a 15-year-old girl after picking her up in his car in Potts Point and refusing to let her out . When the girl's friend, who knew Khan, got out of the car to buy a Coke at a nearby convenience store, police allege he drove off with the 15-year-old girl trapped in the back seat. He drove the girl around Sydney for around an hour, and allegedly repeatedly asked the 15-year-old if she wanted to 'hook up' or 'have sex', the Sydney Morning Herald reported. When she said: 'Stop being a creep and take me back to the 7/11 now,' court documents state that Khan replied: 'You make me feel like a piece of s*** and you make me feel like a scumbag.' Police facts allege the girl became too scared to talk and started shaking. Khan then allegedly pulled into a dark street, stripped naked and forced her to perform oral sex on him. Police say the teen was walking along Darlinghurst Road with a male friend after being at the Wayside Chapel . The Marsfield man then allegedly pulled off her skirt and underwear and forced her to lie down in his car, then forced her to have sexual intercourse. Eventually, police say, Khan drove the girl back to Kings Cross and dropped her off. 'Thank you, that's all I wanted,' he allegedly said while driving her back to Potts Point. When he was pulled over by police for driving an unregistered car, police took the 15-year-old to the police station in relation to another matter. Police said the teenager started crying and said she was sexually assaulted. She went back to her home on the NSW Central Coast and was interviewed by police two days later.

"Authorities say that 27-year-old Adam Morton was taking care of the boy in August while his 24-year-old partner was at work . A New Hampshire man who put his girlfriend's two-year-old son in a running clothes dryer leaving him seriously burned has pleaded guilty to assault. Authorities say that 27-year-old Adam Morton was taking care of the boy in August while his 24-year-old partner was at work. According to court documents, the youngster suffered second-degree burns on his arms and back and burns and blisters on his feet after being put inside the laundry drum. He was rushed to the emergency room at Eastern Maine Medical Center after his mother returned home around 4pm at found him injured. She reportedly told police that she had only been dating Morton for a short time after splitting from the father of her four children but did not believe he was a violent man. Morton claimed he put his girlfriend's toddler in the dryer for just one revolution. However, investigators determined that the boy was in the dryer for a prolonged period. Dr Lawrence Ricci, who conducted his own forensic examination of the boy concluded 'there were lesions on the lower back that looked like they could have been healing burns and incidentally, the two circular lesions correspond to bolts on the inside of the dryer.' Dr Ricci also said that 'the distribution of the burns indicates either that the child was moving fairly dramatically and or the dryer was moving.' In conclusion, Dr Ricci said that the boy was inside the dryer for a 'fairly prolonged period of time. And the dryer, indeed, may have actually been turning.' As part of their ongoing investigation, police took the dryer from the mother's Maine home and tested to see how hot the drum got when it was on. They put the machine on for five minutes at the 'low' setting and the dryer hit 125 degrees. However, when it was put on 'normal' for three minutes the temperature hit 180 degrees. Morton was staying with his girlfriend and her three other children when the incident occurred. According to court documents, the youngster (pictured here with scarring) suffered second-degree burns on his arms and back and burns and blisters on his feet after being put inside the laundry drum . Morton (pictured) claimed he put his girlfriend's toddler (not in the above photo) in the dryer for just one revolution but investigators determined that the boy was in the dryer for a prolonged period .

"One of the original Marlboro Men, who epitomized a rugged cowboy in the cigarette adverts, has died aged 85. Darrell Winfield passed away from an unspecified 'lengthy illness' at his ranch in Riverton, Wyoming, while in hospice care. The real-life rancher was working on a cattle farm in 1968 when he was first discovered by the Leo Burnett advertising agency and transformed into a world-recognized model. Scroll down for video . Rugged looks: Darrell Hugh Winfield passed away from an unspecified 'lengthy illness' at his home in Riverton, Wyoming, while in hospice care - he played the iconic Marlboro Man for more than two decades . His rugged good looks scored him a contract as the face of Marlboro for more than two decades. In a 1986 interview, Winfield described the lucky break as 'life-changing'. The Malboro Man character - used from 1954 to 1999 in magazine, television and billboard adverts - was portrayed in a natural setting with only a cigarette. It was initially conceived by Leo Burnett as a way to popularize filtered cigarettes, which at the time were considered a feminine commodity. Winfield said that he wore his own clothes for shoots and never wore make-up.

Some were authentic cowboys like him while others were actors. Other ex-faces of the tobacco brand include David Millar, who died of emphysema in 1987, and David McLean, who died of lung cancer in 1995. Another who pushed the product, Wayne McLaren, died before his 52nd birthday in 1992 and Dick Hammer - better known for his role as Captain Hammer in the TV show Emergency! - passed away from lung cancer in 1999, aged 69.

"Rob Dennis, 27, was issued a five-match ban and told to attend an educational course for his comment that the referee was foreign . A goalkeeper was given an eight-match ban and told to attend an anti-racism course by the FA after allegedly calling a Polish referee foreign. Rob Dennis was sent off while playing for Sandiacre Town in Derby for a tackle which left his opponent with a broken leg. When his team urged the referee, a Polish national, to reconsider, the 27-year-old said he was overheard commenting that it was unlikely the referee would change his mind and that he was foreign. His comments were reported to the FA and deemed an aggravated breach of rules. As a result Mr Dennis, a father-of-two, was given a three-month ban and told to attend an anti-racism course. He was previously given a three-match ban and fined £75 for the tackle which saw him sent off the pitch. While he hasn't appealed the FA's ruling, the footballer said he feels as though he has been unfairly accused of racism. 'What I meant was I knew the ref and he wouldn't reverse the decision,' he told the Sun. 'I'm shocked and upset to be called racist. I'm not.' This morning the FA confirmed the case had been considered an aggravated breach of FA rules on the basis of racial discrimination. As laid out by the most recent guidelines, such breaches incur a five-match ban and compulsory education course. A spokesman for the FA told MailOnline: 'An investigation was launched following receipt of a referee’s report by Derbyshire County FA which referred to an incident at the end of a game between Sandiacre Town and Wirksworth Town in the Midlands Regional Alliance League on April 5, 2014. Scroll down for video . 'Following an investigation, Rob Dennis was charged for an aggravated breach of FA Rule E3. 'Mr Dennis denied the charge but was found guilty by an independent commission following a hearing in December. The 27-year-old was given a five-match ban for the incident which occurred while he was playing for Sandiacre Town FC, based out of St Giles Park in Nottingham (pictured) 'Aggravated breaches of this nature carry an automatic five-match suspension. The automatic sanction was added to the automatic three match suspension that the player received for his dismissal for serious foul play resulting in a total suspension of 8 matches for two separate offences. 'The player did not appeal the sanction imposed.' Others to have been enrolled in the past include  Wigan Athletic chairman Dave Whelan who is alleged to have claimed that Jews 'chase money' in an interview. Footballer Mario Balotelli was also told to attend the course after posting a controversial photograph on social media site Instagram. The image, since removed, depicted the video game character Super Mario, accompanied with the words: 'jumps like a black man and grabs coins like a Jew.' He was issued a £25,000 fine for the post last year.

"The suburban Chicago officer who fired five beanbag rounds that killed an uncooperative 95-year-old man at an assisted living center used 'unreasonable and unnecessary' force, according to an expert on police tactics. Testifying on Wednesday, Francis R Murphy, a former police officer and Secret Service agent, said the death of John Wrana, a World War II veteran, followed an officer-created crisis. Park Forest Officer Craig Taylor is on trial for felony reckless conduct for firing five less-lethal beanbag rounds at Wrana as he allegedly brandished a kitchen knife at officers in his apartment. Excessive: Craig Taylor, the 43-year-old Park Forest officer who fired five beanbag rounds that killed an uncooperative 95-year-old man used 'unreasonable and unnecessary' force, says an expert . 'There was no threat until Officer Craig Taylor and the others confronted' Wrana, said Murphy. A ballistic shield being carried by one of the officers would have been sufficient to protect the officers from a knife, though family and staff say they never saw a knife at Wrana's home. 'Police officers had more than the ability using their shield not only to enter but to knock Wrana down,' he said. Taylor's defense attorney Terry Ekl later stated the five beanbag rounds fired did not have to be fatal, but Wrana did not agree to be treated. 'He went to the hospital. He would have lived, survived, if he agreed to surgery,' Ekl said of a man who reportedly refused treatment earlier in the day. 'He refused to get it and said, ""I want to die.""' The trial begins at a time of heightened scrutiny of the use of deadly force by police. Taylor, 43, faces up to three years if convicted. The incident occurred around 8:45 p.m. in July, 2013, when two officers responded to the center where Wrana lived after staff reported he had struck an EMT, according to a bond hearing document. Force:  The 95-year-old, pictured with his late wife Helen before her passing in 2005, was reportedly too weak to move without a cane . Wrana was behaving in 'combative' manner, by threatening staff, as he was reportedly scheduled to undergo a risky surgery, and was apparently afraid to end up on life support. After entering Wrana's apartment, the officers saw him behind a chair brandishing what was thought to be a machete or knife, which was later identified as a shoe horn, the document states. The officers left the apartment and closed the door, calling in a corporal along with Taylor and Commander Michael Baugh, who brought a riot shield and 12-gauge beanbag shotgun, the Chicago Tribune reported. The group attempted to communicate with Wrana through the door, but the man told them 'Don't come in or I'll throw the knife at you,' according to the bond hearing document. Soldier: Wrana served in the Pacific theater during World War II and was shot down once during his tour . The officers then entered the apartment behind Baugh's ballistic shield as he attempted to subdue Wrana, who was now wielding a knife, by firing a Taser, the document states. Taylor ordered Wrana to drop the knife and then fired five beanbag rounds at him from a distance of six to eight feet, causing Wrana to drop the knife and a cane he was holding. The Chicago Tribune reported that Wrana was conscious when he was taken to St. James Hospital and Health Centers in Chicago Heights. But he was then moved to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where he died at about 2.30 a.m. The Southtown Star reported that an autopsy found the war veteran died from being shot in the stomach with bean-bag ammo. The incident was ruled as a homicide by the medical examiner, The Blaze reported. According to the Wrana family lawyer, Nicholas Grapsas, the 95-year-old was honorably discharged from the U.S. Air Corps in the rank of a sergeant after fighting in India and Burma. During his service in the Pacific, he was shot down once. ‘The Japanese military couldn’t get him at the age he was touchable, in a uniform in the war,’ Grapsas told the Tribune. ‘It took 70 years later for the Park Forest police to do the job.’ After the war, the Massachusetts native moved to California and got into real estate before settling in Glenwood, Illinois. His wife of more than 30 years, Helen, passed away in 2005. The veteran lived with his 74-year-old stepdaughter, Sharon Mangerson, until his health took a turn for the worse. Grapsas and Wrana’s stepdaughter have questioned the official version of events laid out by police, insisting that the elderly man was sitting in his chair the entire time, and neither his family nor staff ever saw a butcher knife in his room. According to the Chicago Tribune, Wrana was scheduled to undergo an operation. On the night of the tragic incident, his doctor told Margenson over the phone that even if he survives the surgery, her stepfather will likely end up on life support. Wrana than got on the phone with Sharon, thanked her for everything she has done for him and told her he loved her before saying goodbye and hanging up. That was the last she's heard of him.","Park Forest Officer Craig Taylor, 43, is on trial for felony reckless conduct .

"Passengers flying out of Paris will be able to pick up a copy of the latest issue of Charlie Hebdo after Air France purchased 20,000 copies. Despite newstands across Europe selling out in minutes, the French carrier has moved quickly to show their support for the press title.

Those waiting in the departure lounges at Charles de Gaulle Airport will be able to pick up the latest edition of Charlie Hebdo . The issue includes a cartoon of the prophet Mohammed on the front cover, with the words Tout est pardonné, French for 'All is forgiven'. Mohammed is pictured holding a placard that reads 'Je Suis Charlie,' the phrase that is trending worldwide as a tribute to those killed in Paris. The magazine will be distributed in the departure lounges of both Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports.

The first two pages include drawings by the slain cartoonists: One shows a well-known late French nun talking about oral sex; another shows Muslim, Christian and Jewish leaders dividing up the world. The lead editorial lays out a vigorous defense of secularism, and of the newspaper's right to lampoon religions and hold their leaders accountable - and ends with a critique of the Pope.","Passengers flying from Charles de Gaulle and Orly can pick up a copy .

"A man has been arrested in Brisbane for using medical cannabis on his critically ill two-year-old daughter. After hearing positive stories about the benefits of the treatment, the 30-year-old father decided to give cannabis oil to his daughter who is battling a rare form of cancer. Despite his claims that it improved her condition, the father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was charged with administering a dangerous drug to a minor. He appeared in court on Friday, where he was granted the right to visit his daughter, having previously been refused access after he was charged. The young girl’s mother, who is estranged from the father, does not agree with his actions and the method of treatment he chose to use on their daughter. Scroll down for video . The father has been charged for treating his 2-year-old daughter with medical cannabis oil . The adorable little girl was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer shortly before Christmas . The father was charged on January 2nd, for using the drug on his daughter, in a bid to treat her cancer. The little girl, who was diagnosed with the deadly disease shortly before Christmas, has an 11cm cancerous growth which is putting pressure on her internal organs. Her parents have been told she has a fifty per cent chance of survival. The father is reportedly estranged from the two-year-old's mother and she has made it very clear that she does not support his actions. She doesn't believe there's been an improvement in her daughter's condition. He has relocated to Brisbane to be with his daughter during her treatment and is living out of a suitcase. The dad was desperate to find a solution to his daughter's pain and administered the medical cannabis oil mixed  with coconut, to increase her rate of survival. 'My aim was to create an alkaline climate in her body, provide a nutrient dense diet, alkaline water, essential oil therapy and a healing environment of fun and positivity,' he said. Two-year-old has an 11cm cancerous growth which is putting pressure on her internal organs . 'Her cancer ridden little body was alive again. [My daughter] had almost instant quality of life,' he said. 'She would say “Daddy, tummy's not sore"". She would be able to eat like a champion and began to gain weight,' 'Her energy was up and she wanted to go outside with me instead of lay on her back with legs curled up. Her skin colour came back, her eyes were sparkling again,' the father has said. However, according to him, his daughter is now struggling to breath on her own and is having seizures following her withdrawal from the cannabis oil. 'She has spiralled downhill since she lost her daddy and oil treatment. I pray that I will see her again one way,' he said. He appeared in the Brisbane Magistrates court today charged with possession of a dangerous drug and administering a dangerous drug to a minor under the age of 16. As part of his bail he has now been allowed access to his daughter in hospital. A group of people holding placards  turned out at the court in support of the father and to protest against his arrest. The girl's mother  is at odds with the father over his treatment options for their daughter . After hearing positive stories about the benefits of cannabis oil, the father decided to give it to his daughter . The father, who works  with the Catholic Education Department, was left devastated when he was unable to log on to the work system after having his Blue Card revoked. Having sent numerous emails to the Education Department asking for permission to take 12 months carer leave with no response, he was shocked at their decision. He received a letter in the post to say his Blue Card had been revoked, claiming the change in his police information meant his employer must not continue to employ him. However the Catholic Education Department  has made it clear that they support him and this was merely a legality. '[The father] is still employed by Catholic Education and is currently on paid leave,' they said. They said he is free to speak to them regarding his employment and can access their employee assistance program. She was diagnosed with the deadly disease shortly before Christmas 2014 and her parents have been told she has a fifty per cent chance of survival . Since the excruciating decision was made to ban the father from seeing his dying daughter, he has set up a campaign to raise awareness of his situation.

The dad received good news as a result of the campaign, when he was granted permission to contact the hospital on a daily basis to be updated on his daughter's condition. A petition has attracted nearly 15,000 supporters and his campaign has attracted a lot of support. He argued that he 'deserves to have his parental rights to see his child reinstated, the charges against him dropped by a court and the right to decide the treatment options for his own child.' 'There is ample evidence to show that medical cannabis has many beneficial effects for cancer patients without the harmful side effects and other associated risks of current drug treatments,' he said.

The dad argues that he 'deserves to have his parental rights to see his child reinstated, the charges against him dropped by a court and the right to decide the treatment options for his own child' A fund has been set up in the two-year-old's name and is in the hands of his mother. He said all money raised from the account will be used for his daughter's ongoing journey and recovery. His arrest comes after the NSW government announced there will be a range of clinical trials administered to test the benefits of medical marijuana.

Saving the day: ABC execs have brought back the show's creator Barbara Walters to guest co-host on Fridays for the month of January to bring some 'familiarity back to the show' Currently in its eighteenth season, The View, created by retired TV journalist Barbara Walters is suffering some of its lowest ratings ever with Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie O'Donnell, Nicolle Wallace and Rosie Perez. Now under the umbrella of ABC News, the network is considering the possibility of ending the show and replacing it with an extended version of 'Good Morning America.' The View has a history of denying reports that hosts were leaving the show - only to be proven wrong. A year ago, Barbara Walters denied that Elisabeth Hasselbeck was leaving. She did. Jenny McCarthy insisted she wasn't leaving the show...and she did. Since the rating-challenged daytime talk show returned from its winter hiatus on January 5, host Rosie O'Donnell – who has been moderating while Whoopi Goldberg has been nursing a back injury – has reminded the audience that Perez was out for the entire month of January rehearsing for the Broadway play Fish in the Dark with Larry David. The show has used several guest co-hosts, including The View favorite, comedian Mario Cantone, to fill in for Perez. They even brought back the show's creator Barbara Walters to guest co-host on Fridays for the month of January to bring some 'familiarity back to the show,' as an insider explained to Daily Mail Online. But ABC News has been pressuring the show's executive producer to make some changes to the show, with its lackluster ratings. The show's direct competition, The Talk, is narrowing in on the gap and is close to overtaking it; and freshman talker The Real continues to crush the show in the key demographic age of 18 to 34-year-olds. The 50-year-old Perez was a last minute addition to The View lineup. As first reported last July by Daily Mail Online, new co-host Nicolle Wallace and former reality show October Gonzalez had landed the spots once occupied by Sherri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy. Favorite: The show has used several guest co-hosts, including The View favorite, comedian Mario Cantone, to fill in for Rosie Perez during her rehearsals for her stint on Broadway. Mario was also a Sex and the City fave . 'But once the producers started doing test shows and chemistry tests, they realized October just wasn't going to cut it. Good looks and girl-next-door charm alone wasn't going to carry her at the Hot Topics table,' explained the insider. Perez confessed during an appearance on the Wendy Williams Show last fall, that she was a last minute addition to the show. 'They approached me two weeks before and I only had a day to decide,' she told Williams. The actress and former choreographer was friends with O'Donnell prior to working together on the show, but the two fell out after a debate about Bill Cosby's rape allegations caused tension with them behind the scenes. Perez had a major melt down after a hostile, gum-chewing O'Donnell treated her with disdain during an on-air segment discussing the rape allegations against Bill Cosby. Perez had argued that Cosby has been pilloried by social media and that there is no way to prove that the allegations are true. Perez attempted to defend her opinion to O'Donnell but O'Donnell wasn't having it. The actress also became difficult to work with, having gone through six makeup artists, two assistants, and several hair stylists before deciding to do her own hair most days. As indicated by Variety, she also struggled with the variety of subjects the show did for Hot Topics and never got the hang of using the teleprompter. Sweet substitutes: ABC is interested in wooing younger co-hosts to fill Perez's seat as well as the fifth seat never filled.  Glee star Naya Rivera, 28 and  Destiny's Child singer Michelle Williams, 34, are being considered . ABC is very interested in wooing younger co-hosts to fill Perez's seat and the fifth seat that was never filled in it's attempt to save the show. The front runner now is former Destiny's Child singer Michelle Williams, 34, who came in for a single guest hosting position on January 7 and was so impressive executives brought her back for an unplanned follow-up appearance days later. 'She's smart, witty, has A-List celebrity relationships that can benefit the show and isn't afraid to sell a segment. She let O'Donnell pop a pimple on her chin on live TV during her first appearance,' said the insider. ABC News is also still interested in Glee star Naya Rivera, 28. Of the guest hosts, the actress has been invited back the most to fill-in and she doesn't mind a good argument on a topic. 'She confessed that she only showers once every three days and social media went crazy. That's the type of person they think will help the show pop again,' said the source. There will be additional younger co-hosts in throughout the month of January and ABC News is also trying to get some former co-hosts to come back and fill-in to bring back some of the audience. Overall ratings are down 34 percent, according to sources,  and they hope to gain viewers back. Joy Behar was supposed to guest host on Monday and Tuesday of this week, but came down with the flu and Cantone sat in her in place.","Rosie Perez, who has been on hiatus while rehearsing for a Broadway show, has been let go .

"Police fear a mounting number of thrill-seekers are risking death by copying videos of trained climbers and swinging from enormous cliffs. The dangerous stunt, known as rope swinging, sees typically young people attaching a rope to their feet before plummeting off the edge and swinging across the cliff face. While accessing the spot is illegal, police say daredevils are deliberately climbing over barriers in order to access the cliff. Authorities visited a cliff known as The Fear in Manly looking for anchor points on Wednesday, but all they found was a rope attached to a rock, reports Manly Daily.

Videos are surfacing on social media of experienced climbers taking the plunge, but police say it is the amateur copycats that are the real concern. While accessing the spot is illegal, police say the thrill-seekers are deliberately climbing over fences and barriers in order to access the cliff. Superintendent Dave Darcy 'people seeing that on social media, especially young males, will think it's achievable but won't have the expertise, knowledge or specific equipment,' Supt Darcy said. 'When these activities go wrong, and inevitably they will, it is members of the emergency services who have to attend and investigate the full circumstances,' he said. 'Sadly the recent death of a man who fell and died at the location appears to have done nothing to deter this type of risk-taking activity,' Supt Darcy said. Superintendent Dave Darcy said the tragic death of Gareth Jones has failed to deter the rope-swinging trend .

"A young Muslim man has been stabbed to death in Dresden, east Germany, in an attack which is feared to be connected to recent 'anti-Islamisation' marches in the city . Khaled Idris Bahray, 20, an Eritrean-born Muslim, was found stabbed to death in the early hours of Tuesday, Dresden prosecution office has said. His body was discovered the day after 40,000 people joined a weekly march organised by an organisation called 'Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West' (PEGIDA). Scroll down for video . Rise: Up to 40,000 people attended a rally with the Anti-Islamic Pegida (Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West) movement in Dresden, on Monday . Mr Bahray had gone out to do some shopping on Monday night, and never returned home. He was found dead outside his house on Tuesday morning, police say. Dresden prosecution office has launched 'an extensive investigation' into the murder. PEGIDA marches has become a weekly sight in Dresden in recent months, and up to 40,000 is said to have taken to the streets on Monday, the day of Mr Bahray's disappearance. Thousands were seen waving German flags in the dark . and chanting 'Luegenpresse' (Lying press), a Nazi term, and 'Wir . sind das Volk' (We are the people). Possible connection: Stabbing victim Khaled Idris Bahray, 20, an Eritrean-born Muslim, had left his house to go shopping on Monday, the same night as the PEGIDA march in Dresden . Growing numbers: A supporter of the PEGIDA movement in Berlin holds a sticker with a crossed mosque symbol while supporters gathered for a march in their first demonstration in the German capital this month . The record number of marchers were emboldened by the . Islamist attack on French magazine Charlie Hebdo. Co-founder Lutz Bachmann, 41, says his 'Patriotic Europeans . Against the Islamisation of the West' campaign, born on Facebook . three months ago, represents the silent majority and has huge . potential across Germany and Europe. 'This is the tip of the iceberg,' Bachmann, who has a . criminal conviction for burglary, told Reuters in an interview. While PEGIDA leaders deny they are racist and are careful to . distinguish between Islamists and most of Germany's 4 million . Muslims, slogans like 'No Sharia!' and 'In 2035 Germans will be . a minority!' betray a hostility to foreigners. At Monday's rally, Bachmann called on politicians to force . immigrants to integrate. 'Every religion is welcome in Germany. But you can't try to . influence German culture and life,' Kathrin Oertel, a PEGIDA . co-founder, told Reuters. To the 35,000 people who joined a state-organised protest . against PEGIDA on Saturday in Dresden and about 100,000 across . Germany on Monday, the movement is openly racist. 'They are using a fear of Islam to put chauvinism and racism . on the street,' said Michael Nattke of Dresden's Culture Office. Angela Merkel has condemned the movement using strong language calling its members racists 'with . hatred in their hearts.' The debate has exposed divisions among her conservative . supporters on how to tackle rising immigration. A new . protest party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), is gaining . ground as a result. A protestor holds a poster showing German Chancellor Angela Merkel wearing a head scarf in front of the Reichtstags building  and the writing 'Mrs Merkel here is the people' during the PEGIDA rally in Dresden . PEGIDA owes much of its success to the peculiarities of . Dresden, a  city destroyed by the Allies in 1945 and . since painstakingly restored. Mark Arenhoevel, a politics professor at Dresden's Technical . University, says Dresden is less mixed than other cities. 'There . is more xenophobia than in some other cities so there is big . potential for mobilising support,' he said. In Communist times, Dresden was known as 'Valley of the . Clueless' because western media signals could not be picked up. It has a tradition of holding some of Europe's biggest . neo-Nazi marches on Feb. 13 to commemorate the firebombing of . the city during the final months of World War Two. Nattke estimates 2,000 neo-Nazis and right-wing soccer . hooligans attend PEGIDA rallies, joining ordinary conservatives. Bachmann has no intention of weeding out neo-Nazis. 'No one has 'I am a Nazi, I am a hooligan' written on their . forehead,' Bachmann said. 'This is a public event and as the . organiser I don't have the authority to refuse people.' Added to a traditional conservatism, many people in Dresden . and the surrounding state of Saxony are disillusioned with . politics because the same party -- Merkel's Christian Democrats . (CDU) -- has ruled the state since reunification 25 years ago. 'I'm not a Nazi but everyone who enjoys our hospitality must . mix in and respect our culture,' said a sign held by Dresden . resident Joerg Schultz, 45. Xenophobia is also fed by the city's low number of . immigrants and disproportionately small Muslim population. A poll last week showed that about 70 percent of non-Muslim . Germans in Saxony feel threatened by Muslims. A sharp rise in the number of immigrants and asylum seekers . has fuelled a debate in Germany, as in other European countries, . with some politicians calling for tighter immigration rules. Although its asylum laws are among the most liberal in the . western world, Germany has never become a genuine melting pot of . cultures. A PEGIDA march in . Oslo this week attracted 200 people, although a counter . demonstration drew 900. Next month, the group plans a march in . Switzerland.","Thousands have been joining weekly anti-Islam marches in Dresden .

"The BBC did have a cultural mindset of discriminating against older women, a damning report has revealed. The study examining the role of women in news and current affairs broadcasting criticised the industry for its sexist attitudes and singled out the BBC as having the biggest obligation to improve. Lord Best, who chaired the investigation by the House of Lords Communications Committee, claimed change was not happening quickly enough and that female presenters still become 'invisible' and 'fade away' once they reach 50. While the report looked at the entire broadcast industry, the BBC was repeatedly singled out as having a particular responsibility due to it being funded by the £145.50 licence fee . The strongly-worded 60-page report, published today, concluded that Ofcom should play a greater role in policing how broadcasters treat women and impose sanctions on those not living up to expectations. While the report looked at the entire broadcast industry, the BBC was repeatedly singled out as having a particular responsibility due to it being funded by the £145.50 licence fee. The committee collected emotional evidence from high-profile female broadcasters including ITV News' social affairs editor Penny Marshall, 52, former BBC journalist Olenka Frenkiel, 59, and former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly, 57, who won an age discrimination case against the corporation. Their comments lifted the lid on the 'bullying' tactics women are subjected to and how they are expected to abandon childcare duties if they are required to work, particularly at night. It was claimed that there are different standards for men, particularly as they get older. Tribunal victory: Former BBC presenter Miriam O'Reilly won an ageism claim against the BBC four years ago . Miss O'Reilly and Miss Frenkiel suggested there is an 'informal policy' of discrimination and that while older women saw their careers dry up, their male colleagues could 'continue to function as normal, permitted to be ugly, grizzly, fat, old, and peculiar'. With presenters including Moira Stewart, Anna Ford, Selina Scott and Julia Somerville all reportedly asserting they had been sidelined because of their age, Miss Marshall described herself to the committee as 'kind of the last woman standing'. The report noted that while the majority of those over 50 in the UK are women, men account for 82 per cent of television presenters above that age. It found that the UK industry compared poorly to other countries, particularly the US and Scandinavia, with the treatment of older women. Fran Unsworth, the BBC's deputy director of news and current affairs, accepted that there had been a cultural mindset which had been biased against older women on television, but claimed this was no longer the case. The report suggested that if the situation had not improved within a year, a new body should be set up to ensure broadcasters meet set gender equality targets. The BBC said: 'Nearly half of the BBC's news and current affairs workforce is female with more than a third in leadership positions. We are always looking at what more we can do.'","Study examined role of women in news and current affairs broadcasting .

"Shortages of basic goods  in crisis-hit Venezuela has created a lucrative new profession... queuing to buy things for other people. The country is experiencing a recession triggered in part by a scarcity of hard currency - which limits imports of essential goods. As a result, there are shortages of nearly a third of all basic goods and as well as tumbling oil prices, inflation ballooned to 64% last year. Krisbell Villarroel is one of many people who make a living by waiting in line to buy everything from milk and sugar to diapers and shampoo. Scroll down for video . Falling oil prices and shortages of goods in crisis-hit Venezuela has created a lucrative new profession. Pictured, nearly empty shelves at a supermarket in Caracas . Many people now make a living queuing to buy basics for those who can afford to hire someone to wait in line. Pictured, lines outside a supermarket due to a long term shortage in Caracas, Venezuela . She then sells the products to clients who pay her for the time she spends standing in queues. The 22-year-old single mother of two small children in Caracas, told AFP: 'Every day, I have to get up at two in the morning and call my friends to find out where things are for sale or what is for sale. 'That is how I spend my day. I get out of the first line at 10:00 am and then perhaps go to another to see what they are selling. 'In one store, I might get milk, sugar or coffee, but in another - flour, rice, diapers or shampoo.' She said her customers are families who do not have the time or really the need to wait in line, such as business people who can afford to pay someone else to do it for them. Each day, she makes between 600 and 1,200 bolivars per shopping assignment (which is 3.6 to 7.1 dollars at the black market exchange rate). She earns at least 13,200 bolivars a month (about $80) by reselling items to her customers - more than some university professors make. The country's economic woes have triggered severe shortages of some staple products, with government-controlled supermarkets now limiting the amount of certain products customers can purchase . There are shortages of nearly a third of all basic goods in Venezuela and inflation ballooned to 64% last year . But she adds it is hard to juggle this kind of work with raising small kids and she is sometimes forced to take with her to the stores. 'No one lets me cut in front of them. I have to be there and it's hard because the kids are restless and get tired,' she said. At times she negotiates with informal vendors who make a point of always being first in line. She pays them for their spot and sells them part of her loot because, as she says, 'everything has a price.' But waiting in line at night is risky in a crime-ridden nation with the second highest murder rate in the world, at 58 per 100,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization. Ms Villarroel insists she is not breaking the law. 'If this problem of the lines is resolved I would have to find another job in order to look after my daughters. I am raising them alone, and that is why I do it. There are many women like me,' she added. Ms Villarroel says she is paid to buy everything from milk and sugar to flour, rice, diapers or shampoo . Some restaurant owners have employees whose only job is to wait in line to buy food to put on the menu . 'If I want 10 packages of cornmeal, why can I only have four? It should not be that way,' she said, referring to rationing imposed by stores. And several restaurant owners in the Venezuelan capital say they have employees whose only job is to wait in line at supermarkets and stores to buy food to put on the menu. In recent days, as long, slow moving lines formed at stores and some fights broke out, the government has ordered security forces to guard state-owned and private supermarkets. Some pro-government state governments have even banned people from lining up at night outside stores. Venezuela gets 96% of its foreign currency from oil and 2015 has already seen a sharp fall in oil prices. This could make shortages and rationing at stores even worse in the coming months. The government of Nicolas Maduro says the country is at 'economic war' triggered by the opposition and by business people bent on destabilizing his administration. But many economists say the model Maduro inherited from his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, of currency and price controls has been a failure and accentuated the country's dependency on oil as a main source of revenue. 2015 has already seen a sharp fall in oil prices which could make shortages and rationing at stores even worse in the coming months .","Country is in a recession triggered in part by a scarcity of hard currency .

"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is looking increasingly likely to visit Russia in his first trip abroad since taking power three years ago, giving the world an unprecedented chance to see him at work on the international stage. Moscow has invited many world leaders - including Kim and the presidents of China and South Korea - to celebrations marking the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany, which will include a massive parade on Red Square. Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said last month the Kremlin had received the 'first signals from Pyongyang' that the North Korean leader is planning to attend the May 9 festivities. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un could visit Russia on May 9 for the 70th anniversary celebration of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany, which will include a massive parade on Red Square . South Korean media quoted anonymous sources in Beijing this week as saying that Kim is likely to accept. U.S. President Barack Obama has reportedly decided to stay home, so that awkwardness has apparently been averted. North Korea has not officially commented on the invitation and still has ample time to decline it. But choosing Moscow for his first overseas trip would be a strong indication of the direction Kim wants to take his country. It would also provide the outside world with a rare look at a man who, while revered at the centre of an intense cult of personality at home, is one of the biggest mysteries in international politics. If he attends it will be Kim's first trip abroad since taking power three years ago, and will be the world's first chance to see the dictator work on an international stage .

"From their perch 200 miles (320km) above Earth, astronauts have sent thousands of incredible images of our planet glittering with lights. But what we usually don’t see is the high-tech ‘office’ within the ISS from which these stunning photos are captured. Now Nasa has released a spectacular image of the Cupola – a module that provides panoramic views of Earth and houses one of the space station's two robotic work stations. Scroll down for video . This image of the interior view from the International Space Station's Cupola module was taken on January 4. The large bay windows allows the Expedition 42 crew to see outside.

At any time, crew members in the Cupola can communicate with other crew members, either in another part of the station or outside during spacewalk activities. Don Pettit, one of Nasa's most prolific astronaut photographers, has spent large amounts of his time in the Cupola, trying to get the best shot of Earth. There are often as up to eight cameras set up with different lenses. At times, astronauts compete with each other for the best position. 'Say a volcano's going off,' said Pettit. 'Maybe one crewmate has a 400mm, maybe one has a midrange 85-180mm lens. 'And then someone's shooting with a wide-angle lens. We're all shooting at the same subject at the same time in this rather small space.' 'You want to take pictures and share them freely with anybody who's willing to look at your photography. And that, to me, is more of a compliment than anything else,’ he added.

"The head of the world's economic watchdog delivered a stunning endorsement of the coalition's record last night - saying Britain was setting an example to the rest of the world. Christine Lagarde, director of the International Monetary Fund, said in much of the world growth was 'too low, too fragile'. But completing an extraordinary volte face on the Government's austerity measures - which as recently as 2013 were being attacked by the IMP as 'playing with fire' - she called on other countries to look to the UK's example. Scroll down for video . Christine Lagarde (left), director of the international Monetary Fund, shakes hands with Prime Minister David Cameron after giving a glowing endorsement of the British economy . Mr Cameron (left) listens as Miss Lagarde speaks to media at a Global Economy conference in Washington . Miss Lagarde was speaking after talks in Washington with David Cameron and other senior economic figures from around the world. 'The UK is leading in a very eloquent and convincing way in the European Union,' she said. 'A few countries, only a few, are driving growth: one is the USA, where growth is solid, anchored and where we foresee a 2015 that will be also a good year. And the UK where clearly growth is improving, the deficit has been reduced, and where the unemployment is going down. Miss Lagarde said Mr Cameron's coalition government was setting an example to the rest of the world . 'Certainly from a global perspective this is exactly the sort of result that we would like to see: more growth, less unemployment, a growth that is more inclusive, that is better shared, and a growth that is also sustainable and more balanced.' Miss Lagarde's endorsement will be greeted with delight by senior Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, who were angered by previous IMF criticism of their policies. In 2013, the organisation warned that persevering with strict austerity policies risked denting Britain's economic prospects. Olivier Blanchard, chief economist at the IMF, said George Osborne was 'playing with fire' by pressing ahead with austerity, insisting: 'In the face of weak demand it is really time to reconsider an adjustment to the fiscal consolidation plans.' Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, also in Washington, said Britain and the US were doing 'better than the Eurozone' but had 'stagnant living standards'. People would be worse off in real terms by May's general election than they were in 2010, he said. Mr Balls also insisted that exiting the EU under a re-elected Conservative government which has pledged to hold an in/out referendum was now the biggest risk to Britain's economy. Former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said: 'Britain's place is for the British to decide. But as an American friend of Britain I think it would be a disaster if Britain were to leave Europe. One of the central themes of our report is the importance of collaboration between countries in making the global economy work for everyone. 'Otherwise you're going to have taxes cut rapidly for the very wealthy, who are able to move, which is going to force them to be increased on working people. You're going to see regulatory standards cut in an effort to attract businesses. 'We need systems of cooperation, that enable the global economy to be managed, and that will be much less likely if Britain is on its own and is not part of the EU.'

"A new Sangatte-style camp opened in Calais yesterday, offering three-course meals cooked by a Michelin restaurant chef to thousands of migrants. The 12-acre centre will provide beds, showers, toilets, a laundry service and medical facilities for the 2,500 migrants sleeping rough in the French port town. There will also be 168 power points for them to charge their mobile phones so they can ‘call their relatives back home and those already in Britain’. Scroll down for video . The new camp will provide migrants with three course meals at a cost of £2.30 each, pictured . The three-course meals will be seasoned with imported spices to make the migrants ‘feel at home’. Incredibly, the meals will cost £2.30 each – three times more than the British Government spends on primary school meals. The camp will also offer legal advice from immigration experts for migrants wishing to apply for asylum in the UK. The permanent Jules Ferry camp – a ten-minute walk from where migrants jump on lorries bound for the UK – will cost about £6million a year to run. Half the bill will be paid using a £3million ‘special’ grant from the EU which would include money from British taxpayers. The other half is being paid by the French government. Camp director Stephane Duval said: ‘It will be a more complete service than Sangatte, which only offered accommodation. Here we will also offer food, medical care, laundry and washing facilities and social care.’ Last night hundreds of smiling migrants queued for the camp’s first meal. The kitchen is being run by three-star Michelin chef Christophe Duchene, pictured . Portions of chick peas in lamb broth were served from vats inside a large army-style tent in the grounds of the former children’s summer camp. A 23-year-old Afghan called Raja said: ‘The facilities are much better here than anything we’d had before. The food is also much better too. ‘I’m really pleased that they have lots of power sockets as I like to speak to my friends in England on the phone and over Facebook.’ He added: ‘I worked as a chef in Scotland for six years after getting to Britain on a lorry from Dunkirk. Now I am trying to get on another lorry in Calais.’ Eritrean Sami, 21, who has been trying to get on a truck for four months, said the camp would help him stay for as long as it took to reach Britain. He said: ‘I think the new centre is a big improvement. The food here is really good. It’s better than before.’ A camp source added: ‘We were expecting more people but there are a large queue of lorries on the road to the port which many are trying to get on. ‘This is their real priority.’ The centre can cook for 500 migrants a day. By mid-March, up to 1,500 will be given one three-course meal at two sittings between 5pm and 7pm. They will be given soup as a starter, a different main course each day – including lamb meatballs and beef with peppers – and fruit or yoghurt for dessert. One of the four chefs is Christophe Duchene, who worked for two years a trainee chef at the Michelin-starred restaurant Auberge Du Dun near Dieppe. Mr Duchene, 43, said: ‘I am a chef and my job is to cook food which people like so I will be doing my best for these people. ‘They are African and Asian people and they like hot, spicy food so we have laid on ample stocks of spices like curry, chili pepper sauce, turmeric and pepper. ‘I will be eager to talk to the people who serve the food because they will be telling me whether the people like what we cook or not and we will be adapting our dishes to their tastes.’ By mid-March, accommodation for up to 100 women and their children will be available. Men will not be allowed to stay at the camp. The kitchen, pictured, will be able to supply 1,500 meals a day for migrants by the beginning of March . Some believe that queues to use the facilities at the camp will soar in the summer months as hundreds more migrants reach Calais. Mr Duval said: ‘We will provide good-quality food once a day and tomorrow there will be a tent where there will be two mobile banks containing a total of 168 sockets to enable the migrants to charge their phones. The migrants will not be allowed to leave the tent while their phones are charging. In this way we will avoid any problems of theft. ‘The shower block will open in mid-March which is when the first women and children will be accommodated. There will also be facilities for the migrants to change clothes in changing rooms and wash their clothes.’ It is the first state-sponsored large-scale shelter for Calais migrants since the controversial Sangatte Red Cross hostel was bulldozed in 2002. Sangatte was used by an estimated 60,000 migrants as a springboard for illegal entry into the UK during its six years of operation. Since it closed, migrants built various unofficial makeshift camps in the town including the infamous camp called The Jungle where a British journalism student was raped in 2008. But last summer French officials decided a new centre should be built as the number of people living rough in the town swelled. Prime Minister David Cameron responded by saying Britain does not want a return to the ‘bad days of Sangatte’.","Three-star Michelin chef Christophe Duchene is cooking for the migrants .

"They met in the departure lounge - then went around the world together. It was a trip-of-a-lifetime that sparked global attention after Jordan Axani, 28, offered to take any Canadian girl called Elizabeth Gallagher on his Christmas vacation. He booked the trip with his ex-girlfriend - Elizabeth Gallagher - and was determined not to waste her non-transferable ticket when they broke up. Now, after three weeks and eight countries, he and Elizabeth 'Quinn' Gallagher, 23, have returned. But no, they say, there was no romance. 'We're like siblings!': Jordan Axani, 28, (right) took Elizabeth 'Quinn' Gallgher, 23, (left) around the world with his ex-girlfriend's non-transferable ticket. The pair, pictured in Bangkok, said the trip lived up to their expectations . Merry Christmas! Axani and Gallagher said their Christmas Day in Vienna, Austria (pictured), was magical . 'It sort of brought out this brother-sister dynamic between us,' Mr Axani told CTV News. Ms Gallagher, a part-time office administrator and student who already has a long-term boyfriend, told local media: 'We probably got along better because we were strangers. We didn't have a relationship to break.' The pair set off on December 21 from Toronto and returned on January 8, visiting New York, Milan, Venice, Vienna, Prague, New Delhi, Khao Lak, and Hong Kong. Christmas Day in Vienna was a relaxed affair - which they largely spent apart. Ms Gallagher, from Nova Scotia, spoke to her boyfriend, whose identity has remained undisclosed, between taking a bus tour of the Austrian city. Mr Axani spent the day working on his new charity project: A Ticket Forward, giving vacations to survivors of disease, war and abuse. New York, New York! Their first stop was in New York City, where they got a drink to get to know each other . Bonne soiree Paris! They kicked off their European tour with a pit-stop in Paris where they took this photo . Last hurrah: Their final stop was in Hong Kong (pictured) where they spent the day in Soho to celebrate . Axani posted this adventurous picture on Instagram in their final week with the caption: 'Throwback to awkwardly holding a King Crab yesterday in a seafood market in #HongKong... while filming. #itwasnthappy' But they later joined other tourists and expats for a Christmas fun fair and agreed it was the best day of the trip. After getting over the initial awkwardness of meeting at the airport, they soon got to know each other, and their traveling tastes. 'Quinn liked to see the [landmarks] of different areas, and I liked to mingle where the locals hang out,' Mr Axani told the BBC. 'I hate heights and everywhere we went, she took me to the highest thing possible - whether it was the highest level of the Eiffel Tower, or the highest bar in Bangkok - and she'd poke fun of me for my fear of heights.' Meanwhile Quinn's sense of direction was a constant source of amusement for both of them. Mr Axani said: 'I would get these tweets and emails from the strangest places on a quasi-frequent level of her being trapped in a stairway at the hotel or being lost in an airport or missing a train. 'And that sort of characterized our relationship, and is a lot of where the big brother little sister thing came out.' Ms Gallagher has no regrets. 'It was wild,' she told The Morning Show. 'And it's just because of my name... I have to thank my mother for that.' Travel companions: Jordan Axani (left) started an online campaign last month to find someone with the same name as his ex-girlfriend to travel with him on a round-the-world Christmas vacation, since he couldn't transfer the tickets. Nova Scotia student Elizabeth Quinn Gallagher, 23 (right), agreed to join the stranger on the trip . Just friends: However, the trip was completely platonic since Gallagher already has a boyfriend, who is apparently not so pleased to see her leave on a vacation with another man. Pictured above with a man who appears to be her boyfriend on Facebook . Pick me, pick me! Gallagher tweeted this picture of her Canadian passport when she heard Axani was looking for someone to join him on his epic vacation from New York to New Dehli . 'He understands that I've always wanted to travel so while he's not happy I'm taking off for nearly a month at Christmas with a random guy he's smiling through it,' Gallagher said of her boyfriend, who she plans to purchase a home with. Gallagher says she initially thought the trip was 'crazy' but was put at ease after spending hours talking to Axani over the phone. 'It definitely did seem a little bit creepy at the beginning but now that I talked to him it's less creepy and more awesome,' she said. The original Elizabeth Gallagher: Axani (left) originally planned to spend this Christmas holiday travelling around the world with former girlfriend Elizabeth Gallagher (left). She broke up with him after they bought all of the plane tickets . Because Axani stopped planning the trip when he broke up with his girlfriend, he didn't book any hotels for the trip. However, after the story went viral online, Marriott International stepped up to provide Axani and his companion with separate rooms at each stop on their journey. Of the thousands of emails he received in his search, he got one especially touching message from an 8-year-old boy who was going blind and wanted to see the world before losing his vision. That message inspired Axani, who works in international real estate, to start an organization with his brother called A Ticket Forward to help people who want to travel but don't have the money. Axani initially started his search on Reddit last month, posting a plea that said: 'I need your help. You see, in March I booked a fairly wicked trip around the world for this Christmas for my ex and I. Desperate: In November, Axani posted this message to Reddit in an attempt to find another Elizabeth Gallagher willing to join him on the trip . 'While our relationship has come to a close, I am still planning on going on the trip and she is not (naturally). 'And because I hate the idea of a ticket around the world going to waste, I am looking for a Canadian named Elizabeth Gallagher who could use the ticket. 'Anyone familiar with with the archaic system that is modern air travel will know that a name change on a ticket is damn near impossible. 'Moreover, the flights were purchased during a massive blow-up on Priceline and were frankly so cheap and on so many different airlines that they're not worth the headache or money to cancel.' Before potential candidates started applying to accompany him, he laid some ground rules, but also offered to buy the first glass of wine before jetting off. Giving: The campaign opened up Axani to how lucky he was to be taking such a vacation, and he has since launched a charity to help other people travel who can't afford it . He wrote: 'I am not looking for anything in return. I am not looking for companionship, romance, drugs, a trade, or to take selfies with you in front the Christmas Market in Prague. 'If you feel compelled to toss me a couple hundred bucks, great. Really the only thing I ask for is that you enjoy this trip and that it bring you happiness. 'We can travel together and see some cool stuff - or not. I'm easy and have no problem with someone taking the tickets and doing their own thing (see ya on the plane!). 'Embracing the spontaneity of life is more my thing, though, so if you want to travel together (and are not an axe murder) I'm likely game. 'This is for the flights only. In the wake of the breakup I have deferred all further planning for the trip. No hotels, trains or anything have been booked. You're on your own, bucko. Having said that, I will buy the first round of vino at JFK upon departure.'","Jordan Axani booked once-in-a-lifetime Christmas trip with girlfriend Elizabeth Gallagher last year, but they broke up .

"A radicalized Muslim convert from Ohio who was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly plotting a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol is a 'peace-loving momma's boy', his father has insisted. Christopher Lee Cornell, 20, had planned to detonate pipe bombs in the U.S. Capitol before opening fire on fleeing government officials in December 2015, according to a criminal complaint. But his father isn't buying it - and says he believes the FBI set his son up. 'They've already painted him as some kind of terrorist,' John Cornell told the Cincinnati Enquirer. '(Christopher) is one of the most peace-loving people I know.' Scroll down for video . Defense: John Cornell, whose son Christopher Cornell was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly planning a terrorist attack on the U.S. Capitol, insisted his son was just a 'vulnerable kid' Speaking from their home in Green Township, Cornell, 60, claimed his son was a 'momma's boy who never left' their apartment and said he still loves him despite the charges. 'I think he was a really vulnerable kid, just a big kid,' he said. His mother, Angela Carmen, added to WCPO: 'He was a good kid, I mean, he would do anything in the world for you. He would not hurt nobody.' His father told CNN: 'His best friend is his kitty cat. There's no way he could have carried out any kind of terrorist plot. He didn't even drive; he didn't have a car.' Cornell added to ABC that he does not think his son could have devised a terror plot on his own and believes that an FBI informant, with whom his son allegedly exchanged messages and met in person, duped him. 'He told me he had went to a mosque and now I know, in hindsight I know, he was meeting with an FBI agent,' he said. 'And they were taking him somewhere, and they were filling his head with a lot of this garbage.' The parents added that he only had around $1,200 in his bank account - not enough to fund a terror plot or pay for the two guns he bought before his arrest on Wednesday. Arrest: Christopher Cornell, also known as Raheel Mahrus Ubaydah, is pictured left in his mug shot on Wednesday and right in his high school year book photo, right. He graduated from the school in 2012 . Plot foiled: Cornell is seen during his arrest after he bought two semi-automatic rifles on Wednesday . 'These guns cost almost $2,000. Where did that money come from? Well, it came from the FBI,' his father said. 'They set him up.' After high school, where he was a wrestler, Cornell worked at Kohl's and spent a lot of time playing video games in his room, his parents said. At the time of his arrest he was unemployed. They believe their son took an interest in Islam about two months ago - which contradicts the FBI's narrative. Cornell Sr., who is himself not a Muslim, said his son attended Masjid Abue Baker Siddikue mosque in South Fairmount and had found peace in the religion. After turning to Islam, Christopher Cornell became a target for bullies because of his long beard and tradition Muslim clothing, and his father said he discouraged him from talking about it too much in case he offended others. Still, the older Cornell said he supported his son's religion. 'Hey, that's my son and I love him just the same,' he said. His parents said the first they knew of his arrest or alleged criminal plot was when the FBI turned up at their door on Wednesday and seized their son's electronic devices. Christopher Cornell, also known as Raheel Mahrus Ubaydah, was arrested by the Joint Terrorism Task Force, after leaving a gun store on Wednesday morning. Shock: His mother, Angela Carmen, said her son would spend a lot of time in his room playing video games . Swoop: A neighbor captured the moment the FBI swarmed the family's home and left with electronic devices . Home: Cornell, who worked at Kohl's, lived in this Green Township apartment block with his parents . Inside the store, he had been sold M-15 two semi-automatic rifles and 600 rounds of ammunition after staff checked that he had no criminal record. He was taken into custody on charges of attempting to kill a government official and possession of a firearm, according to a criminal complaint. Cornell first showed up on the FBI's radar several months ago after he sent out a tweet in support of violent 'jihad', according to government documents. An investigation into Cornell's activities revealed videos and other online statements backing the deadly extremist organization ISIS, also known as ISIL or Islamic State. According to the FBI, the 20-year-old also exchanged messages with an undercover federal informant about his desire to launch Islamic State-style attacks on US soil. 'I believe that we should just wage jihad under our own orders and plan attacks and everything,' Cornell allegedly wrote in August. 'I believe we should meet up and make our own group in alliance with the Islamic State here and plan operations ourselves.' In instant messages to the undercover informant, Cornell indicated that while he did not have support to conduct an attack on behalf of any group, 'we already got a thumbs up from the Brothers over there and Anwar al Awlaki before his martyrdom and many others'. Caught red-handed: Cornell was arrested Wednesday morning at the Point Blank gun store in Cincinnati. He had saved up his money to buy the two rifles and 600 rounds of ammunition, according to authorities . Awlaki, an American-born radical imam, was killed in a US drone strike in Yemen in 2011. Cornell also researched the construction of pipe bombs, saved up money to purchase semi-automatic rifles and 600 rounds of ammunition and made plans to travel to Washington on a reconnaissance mission, according to the FBI informant. He met with the informant four times last fall and during one meeting in November, Cornell said he considered members of Congress to be his enemies, according to the documents. The criminal complaint says the FBI informant began supplying agents with information about Cornell last year in return for favorable treatment in an unrelated criminal case. Government officials say Cornell's suspected terror plot was in the early stages of development; he planned to carry out an attack in December 2015. The FBI says the public was never in danger and he never made it to Washington. 'The alleged activities of Cornell highlight the continued interest of U.S.-based violent extremists to support designated foreign terrorist organizations overseas, such as ISIL, by committing terrorist acts in the United States,' read an FBI and Department of Homeland Security bulletin. Targeted: Cornell allegedly planned to blow up pipe bombs in the Capitol and open fire on fleeing government employees sometime in December 2015. He called members of Congress 'my enemies' Role model: Cornell allegedly told an FBI informant that radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki had been in favor of terrorist attack before his 'martyrdom' in 2011 . 'Terrorist group members and supporters will almost certainly continue to use social media platforms to disseminate English language violent extremist messages.' Cornell's arrest came only days after a grand jury indictment charged another Cincinnati-area resident with threatening to murder House Speaker John Boehner. 'Once again, the entire Congress owes a debt of gratitude to the FBI and all those who keep us safe,' Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said in a statement on Wednesday. Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, praised the FBI and other law enforcement agencies for their work 'to thwart this potential terrorist act'. 'It is an important reminder of the very real threat that radical Islam continues to pose to the homeland,' he said. The Islamic State militant organization, which broke with the al-Qaeda network and took control of large parts of Iraq and Syria, has drawn jihadi fighters from across the Muslim world and Europe. It has been blamed for violence such as the beheadings of foreign captives including a former U.S. soldier turned aid worker and two American journalists.","Christopher Lee Cornell, also known as Raheel Mahrus Ubaydah, is charged with attempting to kill a government official .

Earlier this year, she sent a selection of carefully-chosen gifts to some of her most dedicated supporters after finding their fansites online . Taylor's words of encouragement were exactly what Nadia needed to shake off the online bullies who wrote mean comments about the college student's pictures being 'the fat Taylor version'. 'When I read [the negative comments], I sort of laughed,' Nadia told Buzzfeed News. 'Some said ""I hate when people are trying to be just like their idols, be yourself!"" Well, I'm not trying to be anyone but myself. I didn't put on a blonde wig and go out and buy her exact outfit. 'I made it work with what I had. And what I had was just me. And that's something to be proud of. I'm not a size double zero. I'm a size 8. And that's OK with me.' She added: 'Because I think what people need to understand is that the size of clothing I am, doesn't have anything to do with the size of my heart and all the compassion in it.'

Push my buttons: The star captioned each image with a handwritten lyric from her songs, which Nadia also included in her own replicas . Vintage: Much like the inspiration for her album 1989, each of Taylor's Polaroid pictures has a retro influence . Fashion star: Nadia used items from her own wardrobe in order to replicate Taylor's high fashion ensembles . Tribute: Nadia insists that the images are more about embracing her own take on Taylor's sense of style, rather than her trying to completely copy her idol . Laid back: Many of the images feature Taylor - and Nadia - relaxing in their own homes . Accidental art: Taylor has previously said that the original cover Polaroid was taken in the moment and was never intended to be used on the front of her album . Natural state: None of the Polaroids are posed, but were taken while Taylor was going about her day, which is why she appears so relaxed .","Nadia Afkhami, a student at the University of Central Florida, posed for the Taylor-inspired collage while procrastinating during finals week .

MyLifeElsewhere collects statistical data points taken from the CIA Factbook, Google Maps and other public sources, and uses this data to offer up interesting comparisons between countries. It has three tools called Compare Country Statistics, Country Size Comparison Tool and Worldwide Etiquette. The first compares the land mass of different countries, and shows how the two nations would appear if they were laid over the top of one another. For example, the UK covers approximately 94, 058 square miles (243,610 square km), while the US is approximately 3,794,100 square miles (9,826,675 square km). This means the majority of Britain could fit inside the states Wyoming and Colorado. At the other end of the scale, Russia covers 8,549,121 million times more land than Monaco. The countries measure 6,601,668 square miles (17,098,242 square km) and 0.07 square miles (2 square km) respectively. In fact, Monaco is so small, that when placed over a map of Russia (pictured left) it almost disappears as the map zooms outs (pictured right as a small black dot) Meanwhile, the US and Australia are much closer in size (pictured). Australia is approximately 2,988,901 square miles (7,741,220 square km), compared to the size of the US, which measures approximately 3,794,100 square miles (9,826,675 square km) At the other end of the scale, Russia covers 8,549,121 million times more land than Monaco - measuring 6,601,668 square miles (17,098,242 square km) and 0.07 square miles (2 square km) respectively. Monaco is so small, when placed over a map of Russia, that zooming out too far makes it disappear. Meanwhile, the US and Australia are much closer in size. The MyLifeElsewhere tool also compares the economy and life expectancy of different countries. For example, people in the US make 41.6% more than in the UK, but are three times more likely to have AIDS, 39 per cent more likely to die in infancy, and have 9.8 per cent more babies .

In the map 192 countries are ranked by their ‘vulnerability’ and ‘readiness’, producing an overall score on their fate, ranging from bad (zero) to excellent (100). The results reveal that Scandinavian countries and the UK are among the most likely to survive - but areas of sub-Saharan Africa will be hardest hit. The maps were created by London-based company The Eco Experts, using data from the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, known as the ND-Gain Index. They took into account location, terrain, pollution rates and national resources when calculating which countries would be most affected. Countries like Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark score well on the scale. But places like Central America, Africa and India all appear at risk from natural disaster - and are poorly equipped to cope, said The Eco Experts. Jon Whiting, of The Eco Experts warned: ‘Hurricanes, earthquakes, blizzards, droughts and flooding are all real dangers for some of these areas, and this is compounded by a lack of national strategy to counteract the effects.’ Burundi, Chad, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo produced some of the lowest scores, meaning these countries will be the biggest victims of weather disasters.","The comparisons are made on an interactive map created by developers at MyLifeElsewhere.com .

"Ryan Giggs has insisted he is having no regrets over calling time on his illustrious playing career as he settles into his new role as assistant manager at Manchester United. After 24 years playing the game Giggs decided it was time to hang up his boots in May, and despite missing elements of being a player he is relishing his role as Louis van Gaal's right-hand man. He told MUTV: 'It was a great opportunity for me and I am loving it. It has been different. The manager works in different ways than I have maybe seen before. Dream team: Giggs is really enjoying working alongside Van Gaal at Manchester United . Experienced: Giggs will be working closely with the likes of Wayne Rooney this season . Legend: Giggs had a fabulous 24-year spell as a player with United . 'Obviously a coaches' work is done before training, after training and during training as well so it is different from being a player when you are just focused on training and that is when you do your stuff. 'It has been good. I have been analysing games, presenting to the [players] and it has been a good learning experience. 'A lot of the courses teach you to take yourself out of your comfort zone because that will improve you. Some of the things I have been doing have been out of my comfort zone but I have really enjoyed it.' The 40-year-old has also revealed that the interim manager role he had at the club towards the end of last season has significantly aided his development as a coach. Experience: Giggs was in charge of United's last four league games last season . Brilliant: Giggs has been lucky enough to play under one of the best managers ever at United . 'It would have been stranger and more difficult if I didn't have the games that I did at the end of last season. 'I had a little taste of it last season, which as I keep saying was unbelievable for me and was something that will be great for me in the long run. In the short time that I have been a coach, that has helped me.' The former Welsh international admits he misses the day-to-day training schedule that comes with being a footballer, but is more than satisfied doing what he is doing at the moment. He added: 'I have been dying for one of the lads to drop out of training to be fair so that I could join in. I joined in the other day, so I have done one session so far.

'The barge pulled off of the [The Borgholm Dolphin] due to upcoming weather on January 9,' James told MailOnline in an email. 'But one of our colleagues had to move over there. 'He is usually a bit delicate so we paid extra attention to the storm and how it would affect him.' The swells were a result of a storm system off the coast of Aberdeen, Scotland, last weekend . The Borgholm Dolphin installation held its ground among the waves in the middle of the North Sea . James Eaton, who filmed the video, did so from the safety of the nearby Lomond Platform .

"Calum Best has suffered from hair loss since his early twenties and today reveals the results of his third hair transplant. The Celebrity Big Brother star, 33, had two transplants but his hair continued to fall out, so he has now undergone his third in just two years. Model Calum confesses that thinning locks ate away at his confidence until he could see no way out but to fork out on a third operation. Scroll down for video . Calum pictured after his third hair transplant in two years (l) and before (r) Calum Best today reveals the results of his third hair transplant . Calum, who is the son of late football legend George Best,  has had three £6,000 procedures in the last two years to keep hold of his hair - and he's not ruling out a fourth if hair continues to fall out. The actor and reality star from Fulham, London, says that without the surgical help, he would have lost most of the hair at the front of his scalp by now. Speaking just before going on  Channel 5's Big Brother, Calum said: 'There is no doubt this has changed my life. I have been losing my hair since my early 20s. 'Nature's plan was for me to have thin and patchy hair across the top of my scalp. But the great thing is, we don't have to follow nature's plan. 'Hair transplant technology has improved so much in the last five years and I have been able to keep hold of all my hair and wear it in my the same way as I did when I was in my teens. 'I was keen to get it done before going on Celebrity Big Brother so my hair would look great on the show.' He had two transplants but his hair continued to fall out, so he has had a third in just two years. Model Calum confesses that thinning locks ate away at his body confidence . Calum had 1,200 grafts - around 2,200 individual hairs - moved from the side to the front of his scalp . Calum has had all three procedures with hair transplant surgeon Asim Shahmalak at Crown Clinic in Manchester. Dr Shahmalak is the hair loss expert on the Channel 4 medical show Embarrassing Bodies and he has also carried out two hair transplants on the programme's presenter Christian Jessen. Calum could have potentially slowed down his hair loss by taking the clinically proven hair loss drug Propecia. But two per cent of men who take the drug experience a dip in their sex drive - and Calum didn't want to take his chances. 'It may only be two guys in a 100 but I didn't want to take the risk,' he laughed. And although the costs are enormous, Calum said that keeping hold of his hair had done wonders for self-esteem - and has made him look five years younger. He said: 'No man wants to be bald when he is older. 'Losing your hair is one of the most demoralising things that can happen to a man as he ages. You don't feel nearly as good about yourself and it eats away at your body confidence. 'For me, I was worrying about my thinning hair when I was attending auditions. I would be thinking, ""Have they seen my hair? Are they going to give me the job?"" 'It was becoming a big distraction. 'I've read research saying that baldness can make men look 10 years older. I would say keeping hold of my hair has made me look at least five years younger. The difference in my self-esteem is immeasurable.' His hair was still receding in this area, particularly at the temples . And Calum admitted that he wouldn't hesitate to have a fourth procedure if his hair loss continued. He said: 'I'm not too interested in taking Propecia. Hair loss is a continual process but I am hoping that mine will level off as I approach my mid-30s. 'I would have a fourth procedure. But let's hope that is not necessary. 'Lots of other stars have had multiple procedures. James Nesbitt has had three and he looks amazing. 'Wayne Rooney has had two and it looks like he might well need a third.' Calum had 1,200 grafts - amounting to around 2,200 individual hairs - moved from the side to the front of his scalp where his hair is still receding, particularly at the temples. Calum pictured having a conversation with Chloe Goodman on Celebrity Big Brother yesterday . Calum, pictured after the procedure, says losing his hair was demoralising . Dr Shahmalak, who specialises in treating celebrities, said Calum had the same Follicular Unit Extraction technique as England captain Wayne Rooney. He said: 'What we've noticed in the last five years is that the age of our patients is coming down all the time. A third of men suffer hair loss by the time they are 30. 'More of them are deciding to have transplants immediately rather than waiting until middle age. Why suffer 20 years of loss of confidence if you can sort your problem now? 'For people in the public eye, their image is their career. You don't see a lot of bald models or TV presenters. 'A simple procedure such a hair transplant can make an enormous difference to a man's life. 'We have seen a lot of men ""doing a Rooney"" and coming in for one, two or even three hair transplants like Calum. Bookings have gone up 25 per cent since Wayne went public.' The star started losing his hair in his early 20s. Pictured, left, before his first transplant and, right, after . In October, Calum shaved off his enormous bushy beard as he prepared to undergo his third hair transplant in just two years. 'Losing that beard has taken a decade off me,' he said. 'There is no doubt a beard ages you. People associate them with middle-aged men.' The star has already had two hair transplant procedures after first  losing his hair in his early 20s. He believes he damaged his hair follicles by pulling it back in a tight ponytail. He also thinks he hastened his hair loss by over-bleaching. Before his third transplant Calum said: 'All the transplanted hair is permanent - the problem I have is that I am still losing my natural hair.' 'These procedures have completely changed my life. They have given me so much more confidence and enabled me to wear my hair just the way I like.' Asim Shahmalak from the Crown Clinic (left) Asim Shahmalak from the Crown Clinic in Manchester, said: 'Hair transplantation is the only method that is guaranteed to overcome hair loss and regain hair. Medications can halt hair loss but they will not lead to the regrowth of lost hair. 'There are two types of hair transplant. In both cases, transplantation can be done so well that often a barber or stylist cannot even tell that grafts have been placed. The transplanted hair is permanent and in nearly all cases will stay in place for the rest of the patient's life. 'The most popular and cost-effective method is called Follicular Unit Transplantation – popularly known as 'strip harvesting' - where hair follicles are removed in a 'strip' of skin from the back or side of the head and moved to the thinning areas at the top of the scalp. 'The second technique is called Follicular Unit Extraction. It is more expensive than strip harvesting and is the procedure which was used on Wayne Rooney for both his hair transplants. The main difference is the hair follicles are removed and transplanted individually as opposed to in one single strip. It is more time consuming – and therefore more expensive – than strip harvesting. This method is particularly popular with men who like to keep their hair short because there is virtually no scarring. In Follicular Unit Extraction, or FUE, individual follicles are extracted directly from the back or side of scalp, usually one at a time. There will be some minor scarring – which looks like pin pricks – immediately after the operation but this disappears during the healing process which takes approximately 5-7 days after which any redness or slight swelling in the treatment area will have subsided. Gordon Ramsay had these red pin pricks at the back of his scalp following his FUE procedure earlier this year. FUE generally has a quicker patient recovery time and lower post-operative discomfort than strip harvesting. Calum also shaved off his beard as he prepared for his third hair transplant in two years .","Calum Best, 33, believes bleach and ponytails contributed to his hair loss .

"In their hunt for alien life, astronomers have so far focused on looking for Earth-like planets around smaller, cooler suns. But these exoplanets - despite having a chance of holding water - are believed to be locked in a rotation around their sun which causes only one side of their surface face the star. Now astronomers claim that such exoplanets actually rotate around their stars, and spin at such a speed that they exhibit a day-night cycle similar to Earth – increasing the chance of finding alien life. A study by astrophysicists at the University of Toronto suggests that exoplanets - planets outside our solar system - are more likely to have liquid water and be more habitable than we thought. Pictured is an artist's impression of an exoplanet around a red dwarf . 'Planets with potential oceans could have a climate that is much more similar to Earth's than previously expected,' said Jérémy Leconte, a postdoctoral fellow at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) at the University of Toronto. 'If we are correct, there is no permanent, cold night side on exoplanets causing water to remain trapped in a gigantic ice sheet,' he said. 'Whether this new understanding of exoplanets' climate increases the ability of these planets to develop life remains an open question.' Dr Leconte and his team reached their conclusions isomg a three-dimensional climate model they developed to predict the effect of a given planet's atmosphere on the speed of its rotation. Though astronomers are still awaiting concrete evidence, theoretical arguments suggest that many exoplanets should be able to maintain an atmosphere as massive that of Earth. Pictured is an artist's impression of a hypothetical planetary system . 'Atmosphere is a key factor affecting a planet's spin, the impact of which can be of enough significance to overcome synchronous rotation and put a planet in a day-night cycle,' said Dr Leconte. In separate research today, astronomers said they believe there are two unknown planets waiting to be discovered well beyond Pluto. They claim these planets are changing the position of objects away from Neptune, causing them to behave in strange ways.  trans-Neptunian objects . These objects, known as ETNOs, describe minor worlds such as Pluto that orbit the sun at a greater average distance than Neptune. The most accepted theory says that the orbits of these objects, which travel beyond Neptune, should be distributed randomly. They should also fulfil a series of characteristics such as have an inclination of almost 0° and an or angle of perihelion – which is their closest point of the orbit to our sun - close to 0° or 180°. Yet what is observed in a dozen of these bodies is quite different: the average inclination of their orbit is around 20° and angle of perihelion –31°. 'This excess of objects with unexpected orbital parameters makes us believe that some invisible forces are altering the distribution of the orbital elements of the ETNO,' said Carlos de la Fuente Marcos, a scientist at the Complutense University of Madrid and co-author of the study. Though astronomers are still awaiting concrete evidence, theoretical arguments suggest that many exoplanets should be able to maintain an atmosphere as massive that of Earth. In Earth's case - with its relatively thin atmosphere - most of the light from the sun reaches the surface of the planet, maximising the effect of heating throughout the atmosphere and producing a more moderate climate across the planet. By creating temperature differences at the surface, between day and night and between equator and poles, the solar heating drives winds that redistribute the mass of the atmosphere. The impact is so significant that it overcomes the effect of tidal friction exerted by a star on whatever satellite is orbiting it, much like Earth does on the moon. 'The moon always shows us the same side, because the tides raised by Earth create a friction that alters its spin,' said Dr Leconte. 'The moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth because the time it takes to spin once on its axis equals the time it takes for it to orbit around Earth. 'That is why there is a dark side of the moon. The tidal theory, however, neglects the effects of an atmosphere.' The researchers say that a large number of known terrestrial exoplanets should not be in a state of synchronous rotation, as initially believed.

"The Army will allow as many as 60 women to participate in the next Ranger course, allowing women for the first time to compete in the grueling two-month combat school. It is considered one of the first steps into the military special operations field. Army Secretary John McHugh approved the change that would allow women in the course beginning in late April. His decision marks the latest move in the Pentagon's push to open as many combat jobs possible to women. Currently about 900 of the military's approximately 1,000 occupations are open to women, but the toughest ones remain closed to them, including infantry, armor and special operation jobs. Pre-ranger: Sgt. Amanda Carrasco, 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, crosses the finish line during the 25th Infantry Division Pre-Ranger Female Screening in Hawaii . While completing the leadership course would let women wear the coveted Ranger tab, it does not let them become members of the Ranger regiment. Currently only men can be in the 75th Ranger Regiment — the special operations forces unit based at Fort Benning, Georgia. Joining the regiment requires additional schooling that is physically, emotionally and mentally challenging. Women and men preparing for the Ranger course will be able to participate in a 16-day training and assessment school that would train women on some of the infantry and combat skills that they would not already have. Infantry jobs are not currently open to women. The Ranger school includes three phases. The first 20 days focus on military skills and endurance. The second is a mountain phase that includes more small-unit operations and survival techniques and the final, so-called swamp phase takes place in Florida and includes airborne assault, amphibious operations and extreme mental and physical stress. Juliet Beyler, the Pentagon's director of officer and enlisted personnel management, said on Thursday that opening the Ranger school to women was the 'next logical step,' as the department continues its review of all jobs across the military to see if they can be open to women. And, as the year goes on, she said each step will inform the next, so the experiences of the women in the Ranger school will be examined and used as examples as other job openings are considered. She noted that some women are already serving in a few specific jobs linked to units of special operations forces. Mainly those are women in logistics, administrative or psychological operations posts at the headquarters level. Strongest women: Staff Sgt. Christopher Welch, Pre-Ranger Course instructor, teaches a class on the proper emplacement of a Claymore mine at the Lightning Academy/Jungle Operations Training Center . But one woman is now a member of the elite 160th special operations aviation regiment, known as the Night Stalkers. The Night Stalkers may be best known for flying the helicopters that took Navy SEALS into Osama bin Laden's compound in 2011. That unit was also the one most often named by Army women as the combat job they'd like. While less than 8 percent of the women who responded to a survey last year said they'd want a combat job, more than 30 percent of those who did, named the Night Stalkers as their top choice. The 160th is a specialized unit used to fly forces fast, low and deep behind enemy lines under cover of darkness. About 17 women worked in the unit in administrative, intelligence and logistics posts, as of last year. Also, there have long been women aviators and aircrew in the conventional Army, just not on the special operations teams. By January 2016, the military must open all combat jobs to women or explain why any must remain closed. The Pentagon lifted its ban on women in combat jobs in 2012, but gave the military services time to gradually and systematically integrate women into the male-only front-line positions. Special operations jobs are some of the last to be addressed, as commanders review the qualifications needed and assess the impact of bringing women in. Military leaders have made it clear that they will not reduce standards for any jobs in order to let women in.

"A girl accused of grooming her teacher into having sex with her has been treated as a criminal rather than a victim, her stepmother claimed last night. Her comments came as it was announced that the judge who spared RE teacher Stuart Kerner a jail sentence is to be investigated. Kerner, 44, took the then 16-year-old's virginity in a store cupboard the same week his wife miscarried and later had sex with her at his family home. Yet Judge Joanna Greenberg QC gave him an 18-month suspended sentence. Spared a prison sentence: Stuart Kerner, 44, at Inner London Crown Court with his wife Katherine . She told him: 'There is no evidence that you groomed her... It was she who groomed you and you gave in to temptation.' Last night, the stepmother of the girl, who is now 19, told the Mail: 'He's the one who's committed the crime, and yet she's the one who was treated like a criminal in that courtroom.' She said the girl was 'devastated' by the sentence. 'What kind of a message does that send out?' she added. 'You can sleep with a schoolgirl and you'll just get away with it? That's disgusting. 'He was in the position of trust and he was the responsible adult. How could it be her fault? How can you blame a 16-year-old schoolgirl? We're all still in shock. 'The teacher slept with her, then called her a s*** and he's been allowed to get away with it.' During a two-week trial, the court heard that Kerner had carried around a condom for a week, telling the girl he would use it on her when she became 'too irresistible'. The stepmother of the girl said she was 'devastated' after Kerner was given a suspended sentence . During a two-week trial, the court heard that Kerner had carried around a condom for a week, telling the girl he would use it on her when she became 'too irresistible' He had sex with her in a store cupboard on a yoga mat in the same week that his wife miscarried their second child, the court was told. The vice-principal at Bexleyheath Academy in south-east London also took her to his home when his wife was at work and had sex with her in their guest bedroom. In between sex sessions he made her Marmite on toast and they watched Bargain Hunt, Inner London Crown Court heard. His defence tried to claim that the victim had invented a fantasy relationship based on the novel Fifty Shades of Grey, in which a more experienced man has an affair with a younger woman. But the religious studies and ethics teacher was convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust. His wife Katherine is standing by him. The vice-principal at Bexleyheath Academy in south-east London also took her to his home when his wife was at work and had sex with her in their guest bedroom . Last night, there was a growing backlash against the judge's decision. Barnardo's executive director of children's services Sam Monaghan said: 'This is the wrong use of the word grooming, it's the wrong message to teachers, parents and pupils, and it's wrong to suggest that a vulnerable child is in any way responsible for their own abuse.' A law firm also warned that judges shouldn't blame victims for the crimes of those who are in a position of trust. Alan Collins, a solicitor with the firm, Hugh James, said: 'The teacher was in a position of trust, and no matter what the girl was saying or doing, he should have realised the danger and the inappropriateness of it all, and stopped it. 'He was the one in a position of power, and it was a breach of trust. 'You can't blame the victim.' Judge who let RE master walk free faces an inquiry . Judge Joanna Greenberg will be investigated by the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office after she said Kerner was 'groomed' by the schoolgirl he abused . The judge who spared teacher Stuart Kerner a jail sentence is facing an investigation. Multiple complaints have been received about Joanna Greenberg QC's conduct. Last night, the Judicial Conduct and Investigations Office said it was considering misconduct allegations against her. If a complaint is upheld, it can result in a judge being disciplined, suspended or removed from office entirely. Criticism of her comments and sentencing also gathered pace, with campaigners calling the decision 'wrong' and 'inappropriate' and complaining that it sends the wrong message to other offenders. Meanwhile, members of the public vented their frustrations on Twitter. Leisa Rea wrote: 'Horrified that (former colleague) & teacher #StuartKerner will not go to prison for having sex with a pupil. Judge blamed the child. OUTRAGE.' Liam Dale wrote: 'Change in law needed. #StuartKerner failed as a teacher/mentor to protect a student and pre-planned the acts.' The Journal of Family Health tweeted: 'V disturbed by judge's comment that the pupil had *groomed* her ex-teacher Stuart Kerner. Children don't groom adults! #childsexabuse' On the day of the sentencing, the Attorney General's office said that it was considering whether to refer the sentence to the Court of Appeal. Yesterday, however, it emerged that it is powerless to do so because his offence is not included in the unduly lenient sentences scheme. Judge Greenberg, 64, has 40 years' experience as a barrister, according to her profile on the Charter Chambers website. It adds, jokily: 'Looking at her you simply would not believe she could have been in practice that long.'","Stepmother said daughter had been treated as a criminal rather than victim .

"It was one of the most written about moments of the England rugby team's ill-fated 2011 World Cup campaign but  Mike Tindall says he has 'no regrets' about the infamous dwarf-tossing incident. 'Do I have any regrets about the evening?' he said. 'No because I had a good time with a lot of the players that I enjoyed playing with, with a lot of fans who I enjoy spending time with. 'It was nothing we didn't do in 2003,'  continued Tindall, adding: 'Not one player threw a dwarf.' Dangerous job: Tindall is currently filming for winter sports themed reality show The Jump in Austria . The incident, which took place at a Queenstown nightclub, came days after England had battled to victory against Argentina in a pool game. Keen to let their hair down, the players decamped to the club which was hosting a 'Mad Midget Weekender' that included a dwarf-throwing contest. Worse still, Tindall, then captain, was also pictured with his arm around a 'mystery blonde' who later turned out to be an old friend - although not before a tranche of negative headlines appeared in papers around the world. When England limped out of the competition following a quarter final defeat against France and more off-pitch antics, the team, and Tindall, who was slapped with a £25,000 fine for 'serious misconduct', were vilified. Since then, much has changed for 36-year-old Tindall who became a father to baby daughter Mia a year ago and who is currently in training for an appearance on Channel 4 reality show, The Jump. Infamous: Tindall is pictured enjoying the 'Mad Midget Weekender' at Queensland nightclub Altitude . Consequences: England later crashed out of the 2011 World Cup and Tindall was fined £25,000 . Moving on: Since then Tindall, who is married to Zara Phillips, has become a father to daughter Mia . Tindall, who is taking a break from filming in Austria to fly home for his daughter's first birthday on Saturday, is clearly enjoying being a parent to his 'very chilled' baby. According to the rugby player, Mia, who does not have a nanny, spends much of her time travelling with her mother Zara Phillips, the  33-year-old Olympic silver medallist and the Queen's granddaughter. 'She stays in the truck [horsebox] with her,' said Tindall, who was speaking to the Times newspaper. 'Eventing children have to be very relaxed. You are going to travel around a lot.' Despite both parents' sporting success, Tindall says he doesn't expect his daughter to go on to a rugby or eventing career of her own but says the couple already have three Shetland ponies waiting for her. 'Very chilled': Tindall says his daughter is very relaxed and goes on tour with her eventing star mother . Royal: Tindall is now a fully-fledged member of the royal family and regularly attends events . Future: Tindall says he wants Mia to make her own decision about following in her parents sporty footsteps . 'Ideally, I don't think we would have her on a horse or a rugby pitch but she might make her own decision and then you have just got to support it. 'I don't think we'll ever keep her away from horses. We've got three Shetland ponies waiting for her. 'If it's death-defying feats she wants to do, you have to get your head round it and support her, and if she wants to study and be a nuclear physicist, you do that as well.' But with a mother aiming for gold at Rio 2015 and a father who is about to risk life and limb attempting ski jumps on a reality TV show, the former probably awaits for little Mia Tindall.","Mike Tindall, 36, says he has no regrets about dwarf-throwing controversy .

"A Sydney siege hostage has recorded an exclusive interview with Melissa Doyle at Channel Seven. Marcia Mikhael, 42, has also offered to sell her first-hand account for a 'six-figure sum' as it's revealed fellow victims could receive just $1,500 compensation - a fraction of what's available to those caught up in overseas terror attacks. Ms Mikhael was one of the few hostages left inside the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place when police stormed in and shot dead gunman Man Haron Monis on December 15. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Ms Mikhael received an undisclosed sum for the Channel Seven interview, which is to air early next month. But media organisations will be able to bid for opportunities to interview her 10 days after the program airs. Scroll down for video . Marcia Mikhael, 42, was one of the few hostages left inside the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place when police stormed in and shot dead gunman Man Haron Monis on December 15 . A lawyer for Ms Mikhael, who works as a Wespac executive, told The Australian she had a 'wonderful story to tell' and she was sitting near one of the hostages, Katrina Dawson, when she was killed in the police crossfire. She was one of several hostages forced to record a chilling video message in front of a black Islamic flag to relay several demands required by the 50-year-old gunman. The mother of three has offered her story for a six-figure some and doesn't 'want to be insulted' with anything less, according to her lawyer Jason Arraj. 'It's got to be a win-win business transaction... so when I say I don't want to be - insulted, I'm saying I don't want a figure of $10,000 — that's not going to cut it at all,' Mr Arraj told the newspaper. Ms Mikhael will put the money towards a foundation she wants to set up and it 'is not for the purpose of making a dollar for the benefit of Marcia herself'. It emerged this week that hostages caught up in the siege will receive as little as $1,500 plus costs in compensation under the NSW victims support scheme for the 16-hour ordeal, the Daily Telegraph reports.

The maximum payments for the NSW victims support scheme were cut from $50,000 to $15,000 plus costs back in 2013. Peter Hughes, who survived the Bali bombings in 2002, received federal government compensation after Prime Minister Tony Abbott backdated payments for victims of terrorist events to cover the September 11 attacks in New York. He says the compensation has to extend to cover those caught up in terror attacks in Australia. Channel Seven's Melissa Doyle had an exclusive interview with Ms Mikhail . While victims of terror attacks overseas can claim up to $75,000 in financial assistance under Australian federal law, the same legislation doesn't apply for attacks on home soil . Mother of three Katrina Dawson (left) and Lindt Cafe manager Tori Johnson (right) were both killed after being held hostage for more than 16 hours . Victims held hostage by the gunman were forced to hold up Islamic flags in the windows of the Lindt Cafe . An inquest into the Lindt Cafe siege will open on January 29 and the NSW Coroner will examine ballistics to determine which shots killed the gunman Man Haron Monis (pictured) 'It doesn't matter where the terrorism happens, it doesn't matter if it's international or it happens on our own lands, if they're Australians they should receive this help,' Mr Hughes told the Telegraph. 'It's not about the money, it's about showing that someone ­really cares and that's what I hope happens with victims of the Martin Place siege.' 1. How did barrister Katrina Dawson die? 2. How did cafe manager Tori Johnson die? 3. How did gunman Man Haron Monis die? 4. What caused the injuries of the hostages? 5. Did the police act properly in holding off? 6. Were there explosives in Monis' backpack? 7. Did Man Haron Monis intend to die? 8. Should police have responded to Monis' demands? 9. Did anyone else know about Monis' plans? 10. What could have been done to prevent his actions? NSW Attorney General Brad Hazzard wrote to his federal counterpart George Brandis to raise the issue of compensation last month. Mr Hazzard said it seemed strange that Australians who were the victims of terrorist attacks on home soil were not entitled to the same access to Commonwealth compensation that they would if they were travelling overseas. The federal government will now consider extending the scheme, a spokesman for Mr Brandis said. An inquest into the Lindt Cafe siege will open on January 29 to determine how the deaths occurred, the factors that contributed to them and whether they could have been prevented. The inquest may be held at one of Sydney's two coroner's courts - in the inner western suburb of Glebe, where Monis's body was taken following his death at the siege's end, and at Westmead 26 kilometres from the city centre. NSW State Coroner Michael Barnes will determine over the next fortnight how large a venue is needed for the number of witnesses required, including lawyers representing victims and police officers. Following his determination on what happened inside the Lindt cafe, Mr Barnes will make recommendations to governments and other agencies to protect future public health and safety.

"Policing minister Mike Penning said drug driving was a 'deadly menace' Drugged-up drivers face a major police crack down after ministers signed off the first mobile-testing kit for use by officers. The device known as Drugwipe is the first portable tester that can detect the presence of cannabis and cocaine - two of the most common substances used by drug drivers - by analysing a small quantity of saliva. Results are indicated by the appearance of lines on the device - similar to a pregnancy test - within eight minutes. Policing Minister Mike Penning, who announced the device's approval at a road policing conference, said: ‘Drug drivers are a deadly menace and must be stopped. ‘It has long been my ambition as Roads Safety Minister and now as Minister for Policing to take further action on drug driving. ‘Those who get behind the wheel while under the influence of drugs not only put their own lives at risk, but also those of innocent pedestrians, motorists and their passengers.’ Following a positive reading, the police will take the individual to the police station for a blood sample, which will be used in any subsequent prosecution. It is estimated as many as 200 people a year are killed by drivers impaired by drugs. Drugwipe will be used to enforce the existing offence of driving whilst impaired as well as a new drug driving offence set to come into force in March. The penalty under the new offence will be 12 months disqualification, a fine up to £5,000 and up to six months in prison or both. The new law sets limits for eight illegal drugs - cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine, heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide, methylamphetamine and MDMA - at very low levels. The police will be able to test drivers for drug use in the same way they can catch boozed-up motorists with police issue breathalysers . AA president Edmund King said: ‘We have known for a long time that drug-driving kills around 200 people every year on UK roads. ‘To tackle this needless waste of life, the police need to be able to test drivers accurately for drugs and we need tough legislation in place to prosecute those who are found to be drug-driving. ‘The approval of drug-testing devices is certainly a move to be welcomed. 'Any driver who has taken the risk of drug-driving in the past should take this as their final warning that drug-drivers will not be tolerated on our roads.’","Cannabis and cocaine are among the top narcotics used by drug drivers .

"The bleak outlook for the North Sea oil industry was laid bare yesterday when BP became the latest to slash jobs. In a blow to the Scottish economy as well as the thousands of workers employed in the oil sector, BP revealed it was cutting 200 onshore workers and 100 contractor roles from its 3,500 staff in the North Sea. The price of a barrel of Brent crude – the global benchmark – has more than halved since June and stands at around $48 (£31.50). It could tumble as low as $31 (£20.44) by April, according to forecasters at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Scroll down for video . BP has announced it is being forced to layoff some 300 staff due to the collapse in the price of oil (file photo) But the weak oil price also undermines nationalists’ claims that an independent Scotland can rely on its natural resources. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, appearing before the Treasury Select Committee earlier this week, called the oil price fall a ‘negative shock for Scotland’. The collapse in oil prices has already seen a number of major firms scrap projects, cut jobs and slash wages – and the North Sea sector is now at ‘crisis’ point, according to experts. US-based North Sea oil producer Conoco-Phillips is to cut 230 British jobs, while Royal Dutch Shell and Qatar are to shelve a £4.3billion project in the Middle East. Energy Secretary Ed Davey, who travelled to Aberdeen yesterday to meet industry leaders, said the Government was ‘determined to do everything we can’ to save jobs. He announced he has appointed Andy Samuel, head of the Oil And Gas Authority industry regulator, to lead an ‘urgent commission’ into ‘practical measures to mitigate the immediate risks’. Sir Ian Wood, who recently completed a review of the UK’s offshore oil businesses, said that as many as 15,000 jobs could be lost in the industry, which employs more than 450,000 staff across the country, with around 62,000 directly in exploration. The collapse in the price of North Sea oil has seen a number of companies change their plans (file photo) The falling oil price has been caused by a rapid growth of US shale output, and the refusal of Opec – the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries – to cut production, which would push it back up. Malcolm Webb, chief executive of the industry body Oil & Gas UK, called for urgent action to halt the decline and asked the Treasury to radically reduce the tax burden on British oil firms. Fergus Ewing, the Scottish government’s energy minister, described it as ‘the most serious jobs situation Scotland has faced in living memory’. Tom Greatrex, Labour’s energy spokesman, said: ‘It is vital the UK and devolved Scottish governments, regulators and industry work together to minimise damage to an important part of our economy.’ Trevor Garlick, regional president for BP North Sea, said last night: ‘Given the challenges of operating in this maturing region and in toughening market conditions, we are taking steps to ensure our business remains competitive and robust.’","Brent crude oil prices have halved since June and stand at $48 a barrel .

"Study respondents who closed their eyes scored 23 percentage points higher on a memory test than those who did not . If you can’t remember your PIN number, try closing your eyes. Experiments show that recall is boosted when we shut out the outside world. It is thought that blocking out distractions frees up the necessary brainpower to remember things. Psychologists from the University of Surrey put the theory to test by showing almost 200 men and women short films and asking them a series of questions about what they had seen. The first film clip was silent and showed an electrician stealing as he carried out jobs in a house. The volunteers then answered a series of questions about what they had seen – and half of them did this with their eyes closed. Those whose eyes were open got just 48 per cent of the answers right on average – a score much lower than the 71 per cent achieved by those who had shut their eyes. Having built up a rapport with the questioner boosted scores further. The second film clip came from the BBC series Crimewatch and included sound as well as images. Closing eyes boosted recall of facts heard and seen. It had been argued that the technique improves memory by allowing people to build a detailed mental image of the thing they are trying to recall. The finding that the trick also made it easier to remember auditory information shows this is not the only explanation. Researcher Robert Nash said it is likely that those who shut their eyes also benefit from blocking out distractions. Police have long encouraged witnesses to close their eyes when trying to remember the details of crimes . He said that police forces have long been aware of the benefits of asking eyewitnesses to shut their eyes during interviews. His study, published in the journal Legal and Criminological Psychology, suggests that police will glean even more information if they build up a rapport with the interviewee. Dr Nash believes that a simple closing of the eyes will also be of benefit in everyday situations, such as recalling pin numbers and remembering shopping lists. And while his experiment involved quizzing people shortly after they’d watched a film, other studies suggest that closing eyes can boost recall of events that date back several years.","University of Surrey scientists say shutting eyes frees up brain power .
Respondents with eyes closed correctly answered 71 per cent of questions .

'In 2012 we got into stores in Australia - that was our first year on the marketplace and we got voted best seller in retailer's stores,' Mahina said. Shortly after they were 'hunted down' by US retailer Urban Outfitters, who chased the brand for an adult range of the fins. 'They hunted me, they wouldn't leave me alone.

"Outraged conservationists have objected to the Tasmanian government's bold new plans which would see the 'wilderness' title removed from the state's Wilderness World Heritage area label. Under the proposed changes, the stringent protection placed on Tasmania's Wilderness World Heritage Area will be altered to allow for expanded tourism developments, helicopter access and even logging. The management plan draft claims that the term 'wilderness' is 'deeply problematic for Tasmanian Aboriginal people and is conceptually alien to Aboriginal understanding of country'. Outraged conservationists have objected to the Tasmanian governments bold new plans which would see the 'wilderness' title removed from the state's Wilderness World Heritage area label . It further claims that the management of the region for wilderness values is a 'denial of their rights to access country and conduct cultural practices.' Vica Bayley, the Wilderness Society's Tasmanian campaign manager labelled the statement an 'extremely manipulative and deceptive argument', as the Tasmanian government had only recently expanded four wheel drive tracks over sacred Aboriginal middens in the north-west of the area. Tasmania's Liberal government provided $300,000 for the controversial development, which would see 90 kilometers of track upgraded and reopened, reported The ABC. The move was met with outrage by the Aboriginal community, as the area was home to countless rock engravings, middens, and hut depressions. 'This is completely tourism and development driven. If this is an example of 'sensitive development' then the community can have zero confidence in the plan,' he said. The draft specifically opens up the zone for tourist developments, and even allows for logging in the region.

Sunrise at Lake Clair, in Cradle Mountain, Clair National Park, part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area . The 1.5 million hectare region, which covers approximately a quarter of the state, will be reclassified from the current 'wilderness zone' to a 'natural zone', effectively removing the strict guidelines for development and tourism in the area, including Frenchmans Cap and Franklin River, in the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park (above) Matthew Groom, Minister for Environment, Parks and Heritage, confirmed in a statement that 'selective special species timber harvesting was already permitted in a small number of zones within the area.' 'The draft plan is about achieving balanced outcomes that are genuinely respectful of cultural and natural values, while at the same time recognising that the TWWHA is an area to be used, celebrated and shared with the world,' Mr Groom said. While the official title will remain unchanged, Mr Bayley has labelled the proposal a threat to the integrity of the iconic landscape of the state. 'Doing away with the wilderness zone impacts on the credibility and integrity of the brand of Tasmania, and our state's claim as wilderness,' he said. Mr Bayley said that the state trades on the 'idea of wilderness', and that it was a key motivating factor for people to visit.

'The Tasmanian government is seeking to facilitate sensible and appropriate recreational experiences including new tourism opportunities through the EOI process,' said Mr Groom. 'This plan is all about managing the area properly while ensuring we can use it to generate tourism and jobs,' he said. Several of the objectives included in the draft include 'commercial opportunities', 'the support of management through tourism', and 'the balanced use of aircraft'. The draft states that the Tasmanian government acknowledges the 'important role tourism plays in contributing to the economic wellbeing of the Tasmanian community.' Mr Bayley said that the changes showed a lessening of the state government's commitment to protect the area, shown through the  removal of the pledge included in the previous management plan  to 'strive to maintain the property and leave it in as good or better quality than it was found'.

Family members stand outside St Vincent's Hospital after visiting shooting victim Michael Ibrahim earlier this month . The crime scene outside Michaels Ibrahim's luxury Macquarie Street home after his shooting . On January 4 at around 10.30pm Michael Ibrahim suffered a gunshot wound to the shoulder after bullets were fired at him outside his Macquarie Street home on one of Sydney's most prestigious strip of apartments. Police had initially investigated whether the shooting was linked to a feud between the Ibrahims and other notorious criminal families. But no motive has yet been found for the attack. At 36 years old he is the youngest of the family and was jailed for the killing of Robin Nassour in 2006, but was released on parole in August last year. He was released after serving more than seven-and-a-half years for his role in the fatal stabbing. At his August 2014 parole hearing Michael Ibrahim vowed to move on with his life. He told the board he wouldn't break the law if released from jail and would abide by the ‘most stringent’ parole conditions. Being behind bars while his mother was treated for cancer was a 'wake up call', he told the parole board. He was granted parole, reportedly subject to a range of strict conditions, including electronic monitoring and keeping away from Kings Cross and other parts of Sydney. However, now he is back in prison. Several shots were fired at Michael Ibrahim on January 4 with a bullet hitting this tree .

Michael's brother John Ibrahim, 44, is known as the ‘King of the Cross’, for the number of establishments he owns in the nightclub district, and has never been convicted of a serious offence. However, in 2004, a police bail submission presented to court on a charge of threatening a witness described Ibrahim as ‘a major organised crime figure’ who was ‘the subject of 546 police intelligence reports in relation to his involvement in drugs, organised crime and association with outlaw motorcycle gangs’.

"The latest research into pigs may leave some reluctant to tuck into a plate of sausages again. Scientists have discovered that the creatures may be capable of empathy – a  characteristic thought to be almost uniquely human. In an elaborate experiment, experts  discovered that  pigs shared the stress and happiness of their penmates. Scroll down for video . Emotional: In an elaborate experiment involving training some pigs to anticipate a reward or punishment, scientists discovered that untrained pigs shared the stress and happiness of their penmates . This findings  suggest that swine respond to each other’s feelings, and adds weight to the argument that the practice of  separating the animals in farms is especially cruel. Scientists at Wageningen University in the Netherlands set out to investigate whether pigs can show empathy to one another, defined by renowned primatologist Frans de Waal as ‘the capacity to be affected by and share the emotional state of another, assess the reasons for the other’s state and identify with the other, adopting his or her perspective’. They housed pigs in 16 groups of six, training two of the animals in each of the groups, Scientific American reported. Scientists at Wageningen University in the Netherlands set out to investigate whether pigs can show empathy to one another (illustrated witha  stock image) just like humans and other animals that comfort each other . The pigs were trained either to anticipate happiness or distress, by playing them music and either rewarding them with a pleasant treat such as chocolate raisins and a roomy house filled with peat, or putting them in a stressful situation, such as keeping them in isolation in a small pen. Untrained, ‘naïve’ pigs were placed in a pen with a pig conditioned to expect happiness, or one that expected discomfort. All the pigs were then played the same music – a piece by Bach - used in training. Asian elephants show concern for others when they are stressed, using their trunks to caress the suffering elephant and emit a soft 'chirp,' Discovery recently reported. Consoling elephants put their trunk into another elephant's mouth so they are vulnerable, perhaps showing they are there to help. Crows and ravens are also known to be emotionally intelligent, with researchers at the Konrad Lorenz Research Station in Austria finding that the birds comfort others that are stressed after a fight. Ravens sit next to the distressed bird so their bodies are touching and sometimes preen it. University of Portsmouth research has shown that orangutans (stock image) can be so full of empathy that they take on the moods of others. When one orangutan laughs, others often join in . Scrub jays - another member of the Corvid family - have 'funerals' for deceased friends, according to research by the University of California, Davis. They fly over the dead body, wailing and screeching, which may be a sign of grief. Mice have been shown to detect pain among others but only appear to console their family and friends. Garet Lahvis, an assistant professor at Oregon Health and Science University, said: 'Mice are capable of a more complex form of empathy than we ever believed possible.' Similarly, rats are believed to be able to respond to excitement, fear and anger. They even help each other out with no prospect of a reward, according to Washington State University. The rodents also show that they enjoy being tickled and playing by giggling. Gorillas not only care for each other but have even been seen to care for dolls. University of Portsmouth research has shown that orangutans can be so full of empathy that they take on the moods of others. When one orangutan laughs, others often join in. Some of the trained pigs showed that they anticipated what may happen to them, either by displaying happy behaviours - such as wagging their tails and barking - or signs of stress, such as keeping their ears back, urinating and defecating. Despite most of the trained pigs failing to react at all, they were still taken to another pen, leaving the naïve pigs behind, and were either rewarded or punished, depending on their training. The naïve pigs, which could not have known what lay in store for their penmates, reacted to the trained pigs’ behaviour anyway. For example, when a trained pig showed it was stressed, a naïve pig acted in the same way, by becoming more alert and keeping its ears back. The behaviour was even more noticeable when the untrained animals noticed the behaviour of trained ‘happy’ pigs, with the animals becoming more playful and wagging their tails. To test that the animals were responding to each other’s behaviour and not simply the music, the scientists played the naïve pigs the tune. They showed no signs of changing their behaviour, indicating they were showing empathy with the trained animals. The findings were published  in the journal Animal Cognition.","Scientists at Wageningen University in the Netherlands demonstrated that pigs empathise with others that they share a pen with .

"Elderly care home residents’ lives are being put at risk because many staff do not give them enough to drink, experts warned yesterday. They were found to be at least five times more likely to be dehydrated on admission to hospital than those living in their own homes. Residents who had not been given enough fluids by care home staff were also up to ten times more likely to die in hospital than patients who arrived properly hydrated, they said. Some carers are suspected of not giving their patients enough fluids because it makes them more likely go to the toilet or suffer incontinence during the night. Elderly care home residents’ lives are being put at risk because many staff do not give them enough to drink, experts warned yesterday. File image used . In a report, the researchers said the findings were ‘disturbing’ and ‘distressing’ and that conditions in some care homes may be as bad as those found by the Francis Inquiry into the Mid Staffs hospital scandal, which found patients had been drinking water from vases. Their warning comes at a time of growing concern about standards in some homes and the ability of regulators and social workers to ensure they are well run. These concerns were underlined last year when two unsatisfactory Surrey homes were closed by industry regulator the Care Quality Commission, one so quickly that residents waited to be moved for hours in their pyjamas on one of the coldest nights of the year. The study calls for strict measures in hospitals to check how care homes treat residents. If one elderly person at a care home is found to have the high sodium levels that indicate dehydration, the home’s GP shoud be alerted, it said. If there is a second case, the Care Quality Commission should be alerted. The study, published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, was based on the records of more than 20,000 patients aged over 65 who went into North London hospitals over three years. It found that the official figure of just 200 elderly people admitted to hospital each year from care homes with dehydration was ‘implausibly low’. The main author, Dr Anthony Wolff, of the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘I have anecdotally heard that care home workers have been advised not to give too much water to reduce incontinence and people getting up at night. The study found care home residents were not offered enough water in what could be an attempt to reduce trips to the toilet . ‘It may be these workers are thinking they are doing the right thing. Residents don’t want to get up at night, they are at greater risk of falling and there is greater risk of being incontinent.’ Along with David Stuckler, of Oxford University, and Martin McKee, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Dr Wolff found that one in 100 older patients admitted to hospitals from their own homes showed high sodium levels. But among patients admitted from care homes, 12 per cent had high sodium levels. Once the higher ages of care home residents and the greater possibility that they are suffering from dementia was taken into account, care home residents were still more than five times more likely to be dehydrated when admitted to hospital. The study explained: ‘Our findings are consistent with concerns about the quality of care in care homes. ‘Care home staff do not offer water in sufficient amounts, either as an act of omission or, more perversely, as an active decision in an attempt to reduce incontinence and frequent requests for assistance.’ American research, it said, found there was a worse risk of dehydration when homes were inadequately staffed and workers did not speak English. It said the link between dehydration and death in hospital was a matter of further concern. Norman Lamb, the Minister for Care and Support, said: ‘Failings of care that lead to people being dehydrated are completely unacceptable and if it is being done deliberately then this is abhorrent. ‘The law is very clear – care homes must make sure residents get enough to eat and drink and we are making it easier to prosecute homes that fail to do so.’ Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: ‘Deaths linked to dehydration are completely avoidable and unacceptable. ‘Older people may need assistance with drinking, and we need to ensure that care home staff are trained to help them drink enough and avoid increased health risks associated with dehydration, like confusion, low blood pressure and falls, which can lead to hospitalisation.’ Dr Ros Altmann, the Government’s business champion for older workers, said: ‘This is a problem that can be fatal – many elderly people die of dehydration, which simply should not happen in this day and age.’","Elderly care home staff are suspected of not giving patients enough fluids .

"A pregnant mother told by doctors aborting one of her twin girls would save the other said the seemingly impossible decision was simple - she would keep both babies. Carmelle Hartgrove and her husband Steve, 36, were overjoyed to discover they were expecting twins. But that joy quickly turned to despair when a 10-week scan revealed the twin girls were unlikely to both survive to full term. The 32-year-old was told her unborn babies were both monoamniotic and monochorionic. The conditions meant the babies shared the same amniotic sac and placenta - putting them at risk of dangerous complications. Scroll down for video . Carmelle Hartgrove, 32, from Harlow in Essex, was overjoyed to discover she was expecting twins in November 2012. But a 10-week scan revealed her babies were unlikely to survive to full term . The twins were found to share the same amniotic sac and placenta, putting them at risk of dangerous complications. Their close proximity in the womb meant their umbilical cords could easily become tangled, cutting off their oxygen and food supply. But Charis and Connie survived, and were born in 2013 . Sharing the same amniotic sac and placenta means the twins' umbilical cords become tangled, restricting the flow of oxygen and nutrients essential for growth and survival. Specialists warned the couple, if left untreated, their baby daughters had just a 30 per cent change of surviving. They said aborting one of the babies could save the other. But the Hartgroves were adamant, without needing to discuss the matter - they would keep both babies. And in 2013, at 32 weeks pregnant Mrs Hartgrove went into labour, giving birth to two healthy girls. Now 20 months, Charis and Connie, are healthy baby girls. 'I look at them both now and think about what miracles they really are,' Mrs Hartgrove said. 'In the end, it was not a difficult decision. A 30 per cent chance of survival was good enough for me.' Mr Hartgrove, a lorry driver, and his wife already had two children, Charlotte, 12, and nine-year-old Callum, when they started trying for a third baby. Mrs Hartgrove, a human resources manager, discovered she was pregnant with the twins in November 2012, after a miscarriage six months earlier. 'At the 10-week scan when I was told there were two flickering heart beats, I couldn't believe it,' she recalled. 'I started laughing with happiness. I was giggling so much that Steve had to ask me to stop as you couldn't see the scan because I was moving around too much.' Mrs Hartgrove said she and her husband Steve, right, did not have to discuss their decision when doctors said they could terminate one baby to save the other. She said they both immediately refused, deciding to keep both their unborn babies despite them having just a 30 per cent chance of surviving . Fearing she would lose her babies, Mrs Hartgrove didn't tell anyone she was pregnant until she was 24 weeks along. The mother-of-five said: ' I was constantly worried they would get tangled up in the umbilical cord' But at 32 weeks, Mrs Hartgrove went into hospital to have her babies via C-section. Charis and Connie, who are now 20 months old, are both happy, healthy babies . But quickly, the mood changed. Medics revealed there was no dividing membrane between the two babies - indicating it would be a high-risk pregnancy. Weeks later the couple were told their daughters were sharing the same amniotic sac and placenta. Monoamnitotic twins are identical twins that develop inside the same amniotic sac. They share a placenta within their mother's uterus, but have two separate umbilical cords for nourishment. The condition is rare, occuring in one around one in 35,000 to one in 60,000 pregnancies. Monoamniotic twins are at greater risk of health complications due to the close proximity of the two umbilical cords in the amniotic sac. It means it is easy for the babies to become entangled, or to compress each other's cords, threatening their oxygen and food supply. Experts are unsure as to how monoamniotic twins develop. Identical twins develop from a single fertilised egg that splits at some point after fertilisation. The timing of the division determines the separateness of the placentas and amniotic sacs. The unborn twin girls were at risk of dangerous cord entanglement and compression. Mrs Hartgrove was offered the chance to undergo a double termination, or selective reduction which would mean aborting one twin so the other could live. 'How could I choose between the two?' she said. 'I would always look at the twin which survived and think 'I killed someone to save you. 'Steve and I didn't even need to have that conversation - we were united on the decision without having to discuss it.' For the rest of her pregnancy Mrs Hartgrove was plagued with worry that the twins would not survive 32 weeks. She said: 'I couldn't bear the idea of having to tell people I had lost the baby, so I didn't tell people I was pregnant until 24 weeks. 'I went into hiding. I even worked from home. 'I was constantly worried they would get tangled up in the umbilical cord.' All it would take to kill them was is if they stopped cuddling each other and pulled on the cord. 'There wasn't a day which went by where I didn't panic that they had died because I couldn't feel them moving. 'It was a very stressful pregnancy. I would not wish that kind of stressful experience upon anyone.' Eventually at 32 weeks the twins, Charis Faith and Connie Grace, were born by C-section. Both weighed a little over 4lbs and spent 20 days in special care. Mrs Hartgroive, also mother to Callum, nine, and Charlotte, 12, and baby Carter born since the twins' birth, said: 'When I think about the odds we were given and I hear about women who went through similar pregnancies I think I am so lucky to have both of them healthy and well' Mrs Hartgrove said her twin daughters used to sleep huddled next to one another as newborns, and even now they climb into each others cots in the morning . Mrs Hartgrove said: 'After Steve cut the cord on both of them he passed out immediately. 'It was very hot in there and he had been sat down all day, as soon as he cut the second cord he hit the deck. 'After I was wheeled into recovery I found myself in a bed opposite him - it was a dramatic end to a dramatic pregnancy.' The twins are now both 20 months old and very healthy. Mrs Hartgrove said: 'When they were newborns they used to sleep huddled up next to each other like they did in the womb. 'Even now they are in separate beds they will climb into each others cots in the morning. 'I have a picture of the tangled placenta and cord - it is a big jumbled up knot. 'I look at it and think how on Earth did any blood flow get through that?

"Paul Steadman - who attacked a grandmother while out of prison on day release - has been sent back to prison on a life sentence today . A violent thug who robbed a grandmother of her last days with her dying husband when he attacked her while on day release has been jailed for life. Paul Steadman, 45, left pensioner Theresa Cain lying in a pool of her own blood after beating and strangling her when she refused to give him money for drugs. Mrs Cain, 78, spent more than a month in hospital after the horrific attack, meaning she could not be at the bedside of her husband of 55 years, John, in the last weeks before he died. Steadman was jailed for the assault today at Preston Crown Court, which heard Mrs Cain has since moved to a care home where she struggles with memory loss and relies on  a stick to get around. The court heard that Steadman had 38 previous convictions for 96 offences, which include burglaries, thefts, assaults and drugs offences when he was released from prison. In victim impact statements read out to the court, Mrs Cain's children described how before the attack, their mother was a full-time carer for her late husband John, and took pride in cooking, cleaning and managing the household finances. But afterwards she told them she didn't feel safe any more, and was no longer 'chatty or social' or able to remember visits to her residential home by friends or family, leaving her feeling isolated and alone. The court heard that on the day of the attack, on  May 4 last year, Mrs Cain, from Preston, Lancashire, had been due to visit her husband in hospital. Prosecutor Miss Worsley told the court that Mrs Cain's family became concerned when she didn't answer the phone after they tried to contact her to give her an update on her husband. Miss Worsley told the court: 'When paramedics attended, they said her injuries weren't consistent with a fall. The curtains had been drawn and there was blood splattered throughout and a penknife was found on the floor. 'There was bruising to the mouth, neck, ear and back of the head. The bruising to the right side of the neck was indicative to attempts of strangulation.' Steadman had been serving an indeterminate sentence in relation to another burglary at a pensioner's home, when he was let out of Kirkham Prison, Lancashire, on day release and did not return. Theresa Cain's family say the 78-year-old (right) has not been the same since she was hospitalised in the  attack, meaning she was unable to be at the bedside of her husband of 55 years, John, (left) in his final days . In a victim impact statement, Mrs Cain's daughter, Margaret, said: 'Before the attack, my mother was a fit and competent 78-year-old and a full-time carer to my father. 'The only help she received was when a carer came to transfer my father from his bed to his chair. 'After the attack she spent four weeks in hospital, during which my father also died. During the 55 years they were married they were inseparable. 'They should have been able to spend those last weeks together. I'm never going to be able to forget these tragic events.' Describing to the court how the attack had affected his family, Mrs Cain's son Peter, 42, said: 'It's so tragic. Mum's life has changed forever. It's resulted in a reduction in her standard of living. She thinks no one cares.' Mrs Cain's son added: 'It left me very angry and bitter that we've been let down. Beforehand, my mum was an independent, mobile lady. 'She looked after all my dad's medication, she was a frequent person in the bank, she would get the bus to town, visit her friends, go for a coffee. 'She rarely does that now. She's got memory loss issues, she doesn't remember visitors she's had, she doesn't remember taking her medication. It's like she's got dementia overnight.' Steadman was sentenced for the attack today as well as for other offences committed between May 3 and May 5, while he was absconding from prison. He had previously admitted burglary, aggravated burglary, grievous bodily harm, assault by beating, two counts of robbery and two counts of possession of an offensive weapon in a public place. Jailing Steadman to life imprisonment with a minimum term of ten years before he is eligible for parole, Judge Stuart Baker said: 'There's no doubt, none at all, that you are a dangerous offender and a very dangerous offender at that. 'You were sentenced to a indeterminate sentence for the public's protection in 2009. Nothing I have read about you...leads me to conclude that you are any less dangerous now than you were then.' Steadman was let out of Kirkham Prison, Lancashire, on day release but failed to return before the attack . The judge added: 'This involves targeting an elderly and therefore vulnerable lady. It involved breaking into her home, beating her to the end, cutting her face, gripping her throat and then callously leaving her to her fate on the floor which to all you knew could have been leave her to die. 'You have robbed this lady not only of her belongings but of her independence, her unassisted mobility, her short term memory, her ability to manage her affairs, her ability to enjoy life and cruellest of all, her ability to be with and care for her husband in his last days. 'You have clearly failed to respond to the many previous sentences that have been imposed, in the fact that you committed these offences either on the day or the day after you were released on licence while you were clearly and inappropriately trusted by whoever made the decision that you could be released from Kirkham Open Prison for a day. Mrs Cain's son, Peter, said the attack has robbed his mother of her confidence and said 'this is not how 55 years of marriage should end' 'It is essential for me to give the public as much protection from you that I can. The overwhelming probability is that you will never be released from prison.' Speaking outside court, Mrs Cain's children, Peter, Margaret and John, said: 'No sentence can compensate for the pain, loss and permanent injury to our family brought about by Paul Steadman, a violent career criminal that preys on the vulnerable in society whom had absconded from prison. 'We of course welcome the life sentence handed out today. The warning signs were evident when he was last sentenced in 2009 to an indeterminate period in prison when the then, Judge Bartfield, said that he should never be released until he was no longer a danger to the elderly. 'Paul Steadman has however duped some fool in the prison and parole service and, after serving his minimum sentence, was granted day release with devastating consequences. 'We now look forward to meeting the Governor of HMP Kirkham for the prison and parole service to answer for their failings.' A Ministry of Justice spokesman said prisoners could only be transferred to open conditions once they had passed a thorough risk assessment and been deemed suitable. The spokesman said a review of release on temporary licence has ensured that now any prisoner who during their sentence has absconded, failed to return from a period of temporary release or committed a crime while on it, will not be able to return to an open prison or be granted temporary release again, in the absence of exceptional circumstances justifying it. Prisons Minister Andrew Selous said: 'We have made major changes to tighten the system and these have contributed to a 40 per cent fall in temporary release failures in the past 12 months. 'In future when prisoners are let out on temporary licence they will be tagged, more strictly risk assessed and tested in the community under strict conditions before being released.' When asked if any investigation would be held in the Steadman case, a Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'We do not comment on individual cases.'","Paul Steadman failed to return to prison after being let out on day release .

"The Pope says people 'cannot insult the faith of others', adding that he would punch someone if they offended his mother, as he debated freedom of speech in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attack. The Pontiff said there were limits to freedom of expression and that 'provocateurs' should not purposely anger religious people.

In the wake of the Paris attacks, the Vatican has sought to downplay reports that it is a potential target for Islamic extremists, saying it is being vigilant but has received no specific threat. The Pope said he was concerned primarily for the faithful, and said he had spoken to Vatican security officials who are taking 'prudent and secure measures'. 'I am worried, but you know I have a defect: a good dose of carelessness. I'm careless about these things,' he said. But he admitted that in his prayers, he had asked that if something were to happen to him that 'it doesn't hurt, because I'm not very courageous when it comes to pain. I'm very timid'. 'I'm in God's hands,' he added. Pope Francis' comments came amid heightened security in the Philippines as the Pontiff starts his five-day tour of the nation.

Meanwhile police officers caught taking selfies during the Pope's visit were warned they would be fired. The PNP sent a memo to all staff warning them that selfies taken on duty in places Pope Francis visits are not allowed. All 25,000 officers were sent the message reminding them not to take photographs as the Pope arrived in Manila.

"Businessman Bob Bashara has been sentenced to life behind bars for arranging the murder of his wife so that he could devote more time to women who shared his love for sexual bondage. During the hearing, the former Rotary Club president wiped away tears as Jane Bashara's mother and sister told the court about their pain in the three years since she was found killed. 'Every day I live I want to think about you rotting in jail and someday burning in hell,' his mother-in-law Lorraine Engelbrecht told him in court. Wayne County Judge Vonda Evans told called Bashara 'a master of manipulation' as he handed down the sentence. Scroll down for video . Sobs: Bob Bashara wipes his eyes after hearing his mother-in-law speak about the pain of losing her daughter during his sentencing hearing on Thursday. He has been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his wife . 'You lived in two worlds,' Evans said. 'Light - your family, community and friends. And darkness where your lies were your truth and your truth was a lie... I have no mercy for you.' 'Today there will be justice for Jane.' Bashara, 57, known as 'Master Bob,' was found guilty of first-degree murder in December but throughout the trial, he had repeatedly declared his innocence. 'I loved my Jane dearly,' he defiantly told the court on Thursday. 'I will never stop fighting for justice and truth until my hands are raw, blood comes from my eyes and I take my last breath. I am innocent of anything to do with my wife's' death. The judge told him: 'The only person you ever loved was yourself', the Detroit Free Press reported. Jane Bashara's sister, Julie Rowe, had similarly scathing words as she addressed him in court. 'Bob lied to all of us. Bob manipulated all of us,' Rowe said. 'Bob utterly betrayed all of us. Moving: Jane Bashara's mother Lorraine Engelbrect tells the court of her pain at losing her daughter . Anger: Jane's sister, Julie Rowe, also gave a statement in court on Thursday, saying: 'Bob lied to all of us' Protests: Speaking to the court, Bashara again insisted that he was innocent in his wife's killing . 'Every moment will be all the more sweet knowing that you are uncomfortable, miserable, alone and in prison where you belong for the rest of your pathetic life.' The salacious trial had revealed his secret life in Grosse Pointe Park: how the businessman used cocaine and hosted men and women at a sex dungeon beneath a bar called the Hard Luck Lounge. It initially appeared that Mrs Bashara, a marketing executive who was found killed in her Mercedez-Benz in a Detroit alleyway, had been targeted at random. Bashara had even encouraged police to investigate other theories, such as his wife's alleged drug use, suggesting that she may have been killed by a drug dealer, prosecutors said. But an investigation soon revealed how Bashara had coerced a handyman with a low IQ to strangle his wife in the family garage before abandoning her body, prosecutors said. The court heard how the father-of-two was eager to begin his new life with mistresses, Rachel Gillett and Janet Leehmann, and how he would email Gillett expressing his desire to be with her. Killed: Jane Bashara, left, was strangled and her body was left in her car in a Detroit alleyway in 2012 . Scene: Her husband had coerced a handyman to murder her in the garage of their Grosse Pointe home, pictured, so that he could start a new life with his mistresses, prosecutors said . During emotional testimony, Gillett revealed that Bashara had blindfolded her and another woman in 2009 and had taken them to his family home while his wife and children were away. The three then had sex in his marital bed. 'He would say anything and do anything to be with Rachel Gillett. Several people have indicated such,' prosecutor Lisa Lindsey said. 'He created one world; he was living in another. And when those two worlds collided, Jane Bashara ended up dead.' But defense attorneys had urged the jury to keep their focus on the killer, handyman Joe Gentz, not Bob Bashara. They said Bashara could have continued his affairs and alternative lifestyle without getting rid of his wife. 'She is the breadwinner,' Michael McCarthy said in his final remarks. 'Why would he want her dead? There is reasonable doubt in this trial.' 'Plot': Joe Gentz, pictured, is serving 17 years in prison for the murder of Jane Bashara. Gentz, who is mentally impaired, refused to testify at Bashara's trial but claimed that the businessman paid him for the killing .

"Climate change and high rates of . extinctions of animals and plants are pushing the Earth into a 'danger zone' for humanity, a scientific report card about . mankind's impact on nature has concluded.

The research charts the 'Great Acceleration' in human activity from the start of the industrial revolution in 1750 to 2010, and the subsequent changes in the Earth System - greenhouse gas levels, ocean acidification, deforestation and biodiversity deterioration. Twelve indicators depict human activity, for example, economic growth (GDP), population, foreign direct investment, energy consumption, telecommunications, transportation and water use. Twelve indicators show changes in major environmental components of the Earth System, for example, the carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle and biodiversity. 'It is difficult to overestimate the scale and speed of change. In a single lifetime humanity has become a planetary-scale geological force,' says lead author Professor Will Steffen, who led the joint project between the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) and the Stockholm Resilience Centre. 'I don't think we've broken the planet but we are creating a . much more difficult world,' Sarah Cornell, one of the authors, told Reuters. 'Four boundaries are assessed to have been crossed, placing . humanity in a danger zone,' a statement said of the study in the . journal Science, pointing to climate change, species loss, . land-use change and fertiliser pollution. Of a total of nine boundaries assessed, freshwater use, . ocean acidification and ozone depletion were judged to be within . safe limits. Others, including levels of airborne pollution, . were yet to be properly assessed. The report defined climate change and loss of species as two . core areas of concern.

"Funerals for four of the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris last week have been held in France today. Hundreds gathered outside the town hall of Montreuil, near Paris, for the service celebrating the life of cartoonist Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac. Guests during wrote humorous messages and drew cartoons on the coffin during the family ceremony, which included caricatures of Tignous himself. Scroll down for video . Paying tribute: The coffin of Bernard Verlhac kown as 'Tignous', is carried outside the town hall of Montreuil after the tribute service today . Fragile: Friends and former colleagues of Tignous wrote humorous messages and drew caricatures and cartoons on the coffin during the service . Remebered: Chloe Verlhac, wife of Tignous, gives a speech during his funeral . Tignous, 57, had been working as a cartoonist since the 1980s and was a member of a group of artists called Cartoonists for Peace. He also belonged to the Association de la Presse Judiciaire, an association of French journalists covering the courts, and sent his last drawing - a self-portrait wishing Happy New Year - to the association the night before his death. A private family funeral was also held for Georges Wolinski, 80, another of Charlie Hebdo's veteran cartoonists. His works had appeared in weekly magazine Paris Match, satirical magazine Hara-Kiri - considered a forerunner of Charlie Hebdo - and numerous other publications. A large crowd had also gathered for the funeral of Franck Brinsolaro, the police officer who served on the bodyguard detail for the murdered editor of Charlie Hebdo, Stephane 'Charb' Charbonnier. In his honour: A guest writes a message on Tignous coffin  during a funeral service held at the city hall .

Policemen broke into applause as the coffin of Mr Brinsolaro was carried into a church in the town of Bernay this morning. The funeral of psychoanalyst and Charlie Hebdo columnist Elsa Cayat is also set to be held today . The ceremonies follow reports that the three terrorists responsible for last week's attacks could be laid to rest near where they carried out their atrocities, as their hometowns are unwilling to bury them. Mayors are afraid the graves of Said and Cherif Kouachi, behind the massacre at Charlie Hebdo, and Amedy Coulibaly, shot dead after a siege at a Jewish deli in Paris, could become shrines for Islamic extremists. Under French law, the burials must take place either in the district where the deceased lived or the district where they were killed. The Kouachi brothers were shot dead by the police as they charged out of a printworks in Dammartin-en-Goele, north east of Paris, meaning they could be buried nearby. Their father died when they were young and they were taken into care, meaning they have no immediate family who wish to organise a possible funeral and burial elsewhere.","Funerals of four people killed in Charlie Hebdo attack held today .

"The sister of one of the terrorists behind the heinous Paris attacks has been found the be the creator of a type of dance therapy based on twerking. Amedy Coulibaly, 32, killed four hostages at a Paris kosher supermarket the day after shooting a policewoman dead in the street last week. His sister Maimouna, 39, is a well-known choreographer who has appeared on French TV and runs empowering 'Booty Therapy' classes worldwide. Worlds apart: Maimouna Couilbaly, sister of Paris jihadist Amedy Coulibaly, is a choreographer who runs 'Booty Therapy' classes and has made several appearances on French TV . Maimouna Couilbaly has appeared several times on shows such as France's Got Talent (La France a un Incroyable Talent) and runs a dance company with classes in popular Afro-urban dance styles. She is the creator of 'Booty Therapy', a dance class set to 'liberate' and empower women, and can be seen surrounded by exhilarated twerking students in several YouTube videos. Maimouna holds classes in France and the U.S. and a 'Booty Therapy' course of 20 lessons costs £230 (300 euro). The 39-year-old is best known for her dance show which set out to highlight culture clashes and everyday racism faced by young immigrants in France. The play, Hééé Mariamou, is based on Maimouna's experience growing up on a council estate, a 'cite', in Grigny, an impoverished suburb of Paris, as the daughter of Mali immigrants. Condemnation: After the attacks by her jihadist brother Amedy, pictured, Maimouna and her mother released a statement condeming his actions and offering their 'sincere condolences' to the families of those killed .

'I always felt misunderstood in my youth. I did not know where my place in society, at home, at school,' Ms Coulibali writes on her website . She writes that she drew on 'all my frustrations, insults suffered in my youth, racism, prejudice... Towards my mother and myself. 'To hear all the c*** said on TV or in the newspapers about the estates,the way they judge without knowing, I wanted to express myself, give my point of view. Since its first run in 1999, Hééé Mariamou has been staged in Paris and San Francisco . Shortly after police released the name of the man responsible for the terrorist attack on the kosher deli in Paris, Amedy Coulibaly's family condemned his actions  and offered their 'sincere condolences' to the families of those killed. 'We condemn these acts,' Mariamou and her mother said in a statement. 'We absolutely do not share these extreme ideas. We hope there will not be any confusion between these odious acts and the Muslim religion.'","Amedy Coulibaly killed five people in attack on a kosher market in Paris .

"A teenage boy has been charged after his prom date was found dead in a hotel room hours after the dance ended last year. Eddie M. Herrera, 18, was charged with aggravated assault on Wednesday in the May death of Jacqueline Gomez of Houston, Texas, after he admitted to choking her. Miss Gomez, 17, was found in the hotel room of the North Houston Hyatt Hotel on May 17, 2014, the same venue where the prom had been held the previous night. Jacqueline Gomez, 17, died on her prom night in May at a hotel in Houston, Texas. Her boyfriend has now been charged in connection with her death . Investigators said Herrera told authorities the couple went to the hotel room after attending the prom, drank alcohol and fell asleep. According to the NYDN, Herrera also told police that his girlfriend had taken the painkiller hydrocodone. Herrera said he found Miss Gomez, a senior at MacArthur High School, unresponsive the following morning. Houston Fire Department personnel responded and pronounced her deceased. Her death was initially believed to be an overdose but the medical examiner could not confirm an exact cause. Authorities said a further investigation led them to arrest Herrera, who attended the same high school, on Wednesday. He admitted to choking his girlfriend, police said on Thursday. Herrera's name had been undisclosed until his arrest on Wednesday. The motive and official cause of death remain under investigation, according a police statement. It wasn't immediately clear whether Herrera has a lawyer or whether he remained in custody today. At the time of her death, Miss Gomez's devastated family and friends told the Houston Chronicle that she was 'not a party girl' and spent most of her time working at a grocery school when she was not studying. The teenager had plans of going to Lone Star College to become a pharmacy technician.

"The parents of a Georgia teenager found dead inside a rolled-up gym mat two years ago filed a lawsuit accusing classmates of killing him at school before criminal investigators and school officials covered up the deed. The wrongful death lawsuit by the family of 17-year-old Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta names 38 defendants, including three Lowndes High School classmates the lawsuit accuses of attacking Johnson on Jan. 10, 2013. The suit was filed in DeKalb County Superior Court on Monday, just after the second anniversary of the teenager's death. Scroll down for video . Horrifying: 17-year-old Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia was found dead in a rolled up gym mat at his high school in 2013. While local authorities ruled the death an accident, his parents on Monday filed suit naming 38 defendants in a $100M wrongful death suit . Cover-up? Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, insist their son was slain despite official findings to the contrary. They allege their con's slaying was covered up in a conspiracy involving the local school superintendent, the Valdosta police chief, Georgia Bureau of Investigation, 17 sheriff's investigators and deputies, the state medical examiner who conducted the autopsy and others . Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluded long ago that Johnson died in a freak accident, saying he became stuck upside down while trying to retrieve a gym shoe that fell into the upright mat. His parents, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, insist their son was slain. The lawsuit names specific students and one parent blamed for the teenager's death by his family, who are seeking $100 million in damages. However, no one has been charged with a crime in the case. The lawsuit also says Johnson's slaying was covered up in a conspiracy involving the local school superintendent, the Valdosta police chief, the director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, five GBI agents, 17 sheriff's investigators and deputies, the state medical examiner who conducted the autopsy and others. 'Defendants from the various law enforcement agencies deliberately and maliciously mishandled the subject investigation in such a way that anyone who might ever be charged with (Johnson's) death would never be convicted,' the lawsuit says. James Elliott, who represents the sheriff's department as the attorney for Lowndes County, said the accusations 'are unfounded and lack any basis in law or in fact.' The lawsuit filed by attorney Chevene King says the attack on Johnson was spearheaded by two brothers 'seeking revenge' after one of them had been in a fight with Johnson. It also says the boys acted on a 'parental command' from their father to assault Johnson. Second try: The Johnson family asked for and received permission to exhume their son's body for another autopsy in June . Slain? Federal authorities launched their own investigation in Johnson's death on Oct. 31, 2013. No findings have been released more than a year later. 'It's a frivolous lawsuit,' said Brice Ladson, an attorney for the brothers and their father. 'Mr. King and his clients, the Johnsons, know the allegations against my clients are completely baseless.' Sheriff's investigators say Johnson had been in a fight with one of the brothers about a year before his death. Sheriff's Lt. Stryde Jones said Thursday evidence showed neither brother was in the school gym when Johnson was recorded by a surveillance camera entering the building shortly after 1 p.m. One brother was in another part of the school, Jones said, while the other was traveling out of town with a sports team. 'We've chased a lot of rumor in this case,' Jones said. 'But we've been presented no evidence to the contrary at this point.' Lawyers for the Johnson family, King and Benjamin Crump, did not immediately return phone and email messages Thursday. Federal authorities launched their own investigation in Johnson's death on Oct. 31, 2013. No findings have been released more than a year later. 'While our investigation has proven more complicated and taken longer than I had originally anticipated, we remain committed to following the facts wherever they may lead,' U.S. Attorney Michael Moore of Georgia's Middle District said in a statement last week.

"Marilyn Huck, 54, admitted drowning her two kittens on a bucket of water and leaving them on her neighbour's doorstep in a bizarre gesture . A woman has admitted drowning her two kittens in a bucket of water and leaving them on her neighbour's doorstep in a bizarre gesture. Marilyn Huck, 54, dumped the dead animals outside her neighbour's home in Edmonton, north London, before pointing at the bodies and mouthing 'It's payment of a kind'. She is due to be sentenced next month after admitting two counts of causing unnecessary distress to animals, changing her plea on what would have been the first day of her trial at Highbury Magistrates Court. The court was told Huck's pet cat had given birth the kittens, but she had strangled the struggling animals before drowning them in a bucket of water. Huck was spotted approaching the home of her neighbour, who was known only as Mrs Coleman, on November 6, 2013. The two had known each other for a number of years but it is not clear why Huck decided to kill and dump the kittens, the court was told. 'Mrs Coleman saw the defendant approaching her property dragging what was described as a 'granny trolley,' said Alison Armour, prosecuting. 'By the time Mrs Coleman had reached her front door in Montagu Road, Edmonton, north London, Ms Huck was already walking away. 'The defendant turned around and pointed at the kittens lying on the step, and Mrs Coleman started screaming.' Ms Armour explained the manner in which the bodies were laid out suggested they had been thrown. The animals were 'soaked through and clearly dead.' Mrs Coleman called the police and Huck shouted at officers: 'It's payment of a kind.' 'Ms Huck said she [Mrs Coleman] knew what it's about,' Ms Armour continued. 'She then said she had a knife and would kill herself if the officers tried to enter her property.' The RSPCA were called and took the mother of the kittens away. When she was questioned Huck said: 'I got annoyed and did that to the cats.' Highbury Magistrates' Court (pictured) heard Huck  had 'been in a bad place' at the time of the incident . She explained how she had strangled the kittens and then put them in a plastic bag which she had held in a bucket of water for ten minutes. Huck said she had 'been in a bad place' at the time. She originally pleaded not guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary distress to animals, but changed her plea on the first day of trial. 'I wish to change my plea and appeal to the court for clemency,' she said. Huck, of Enfield, was bailed and told not to own or care for any animals before her sentencing, which is due to take place on February 4 after psychiatric reports have been prepared.","Marilyn Huck, 54, strangled the kittens before drowning them, court told .

"For most dogs, a trip to the vet is a rare outing reserved for rescuing swallowed socks and trapped paws. But one animal has grown more than accustomed to the inside of a waiting room, after seeking medical treatment 100 times in just three years. Alancier the Newfoundland has spent an astonishing 210 hours in the care of vets in Bodmin, Cornwall. Alancier the Newfoundland has spent more than 200 hours in vets' care. The dog suffers a range of health problems including urinary infections, skin allergies and has a leg deformity . While owner Pam Withe thought the dog was clumsy as a puppy, she has spent hundreds of hours and thousands of pounds ensuring her health over three years . From elbow infections and leg deformities to allergies to medicine, the animal has wracked up almost £15,000 in treatment bills with her range of ailments. 'Alancier is so used to being in medical care that when the vet calls her name at reception, she immediately rushes over and knows it's her turn,' said owner Pam Withe. 'If we weren't insured we couldn't afford to keep her with all the vet bills,' the 60-year-old added. When first brought home, Mrs Withe and her husband, David, put her injuries down to being accident prone. Among Alancier's health problems is a skin allergy which causes blisters on her paws (bandaged, above) The animal was born with elbow dysplasia, giving her an 'odd' walk and causing her to have bone-shortening surgery as a pupypy . Five-stone Alancier has spent so much time visiting vets she now runs to be seen when her name is called . Among her health problems is a skin allergy which causes the dog to break out in blisters occasionally . Feeling better: Alancier with other pets in Mrs Withe's home. Minstrel, a spaniel, (centre) is in good health while Learbhead, also a Newfoundland, died recently of natural causes . Soon her health problems began to stack up, with the dog almost unable to walk because of a joint problem. 'When Alancier was a pup we thought she was just adorably clumsy. She had a pronounced odd walk with her front legs but she actually had a displaced elbow. Health problems . Elbow dysplasia . Rheumatism in front legs . Leg deformity (result of bone shortening operation to correct elbow displasia) Skin allergy which causes blister rash . Drooping jaws as a result of allergy tablets . Recurring urinary infection . Treatments . Bone-shortening operation to correct elbow dysplasia . Anti-inflammatory tablets to control Rheumatism . Glucose tablets to reduce pain in legs . Anti-allergy injections . Special diet to offset urinary infection . Tablets for when infection is most severe . 'Within six months, we were taking her to the vets for an operation on her front legs to shorten the bone.' As a result of her displaced elbow, Alancier was left with a severe deformity which vets have tried to correct with surgery and hours of hydrotherapy. New problems arose in the form of infections and rashes, with a skin allergy causing the dog to often break out in blisters. 'As Alancier got older, her medical history subsequently developed from bruises and bumps to more unfortunate ailments, including rashes and ripping her claw twice. Now she’s had to have a claw removed. 'She has an ongoing skin allergy caused by a house dust mite, which bring out blisters on her skin. She was initially given tablets but she had an allergy to that so now she gets injections . 'Alancier’s urine doesn’t process properly and she’s on a special diet for life to treat that. 'You have to keep a careful eye on Alancier to make sure she hasn’t got any other ailments.' 'Alancier might be Britain’s unluckiest dog because of the long list of illnesses she’s had. 'But at the same time, she’s the world’s luckiest dog because at least, she’s got us to look after her!' Staff at Nute Veterinary Surgery are among those who care for Alancier. The surgery was recognised by Petplan last year, a pet insurance company. 'Vet Nicky Hallows and her team at Nute Veterinary Surgery take care of Alancier. Nute Veterinary Surgery were recognised for their hard work and continued care of pets like Alancier and received an accolade at the 2014 Petplan Veterinary Awards.'

"Huey was found dumped in Moreno Valley in Los Angeles and was not expected to live. Extremely emaciated and covered in bite wounds and other injuries, it's believed the pit bull had been used as bait to rev up other dogs in a dog fighting ring. Pieces of his lip had been ripped off and there were gashes all over his mouth, which animal rescue workers believe had been taped shut so he couldn't fight back against attackers. 'He was a skeleton - I've never seen anything so appalling and disgusting,' Wendy James, one of the women who found Huey, told KTLA 5. Scroll down for video .

"Since she first made her name more than a decade ago. Alexa Chung has had many vocations, including model, TV presenter, WAG, IT girl, author, and now, fashion designer. The 31-year-old Brit, who now resides in New York, revealed her debut range with premium denim brand AG Jeans at an action-packed launch in Selfridges this evening. As well as showcasing the 20-strong collection at the London department store, Alexa also dabbled in a bit of basketball with the legions of fans who had turned out to see their style icon. Scroll down for video . Alexa Chung launched her new range for AG Jeans at Selfridges tonight. The model, 31, flew into London from New York to promote the clothes. Items included an embroidered shirt and a shirt dress . Alexa appeared delighted to be showing off the fruits of her labour, which included a variety of casual and relaxed pieces, from overalls and T-shirts to pinafore dresses and high-waisted jeans. The range, which is almost entirely made of denim has been designed in the star's signature laid-back style. A grey sweater, which is one of the only items not to be made from a blue fabric features the words: 'J'ai du vague à l'âme,' which loosely translated means, 'I have melancholy.' The slogan was a nod to Alexa's obsession with Parisian chic and the relationship between Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin. A grey sweater, which is one of the only items not to be made from a blue fabric features the words: 'J'ai du vague à l'âme,' which loosely translated means, 'I have melancholy.' As well as showcasing the 20-strong collection at the London department store, Alexa also dabbled in a bit of basketball with the legions of fans who had turned out to see their style icon . Earlier this month, the model debuted a short film which she made in collaboration with director Gia Coppola and online retailer MyTheresa.com in order to promote her collection. The video, which was shot at Coppola's home in the Hollywood Hills, was created exclusively for MyTheresa.com as part of their new Tunes campaign and sees Alexa showcasing her impressive karaoke skills. Appropriately, the leggy brunette is seen singing her own version of Stevie Nicks' 1994 hit Blue Denim in the clip, which is focused around an LA party at which Alexa is a guest. Alexa first revealed that she was working with AG on a collection back in June, telling WWD.com: 'The collection is inherently the missing pieces of my dream denim wardrobe, which, as ever, is predominantly inspired by a late Sixties, early Seventies aesthetic. A woman of many talents: As well as acting as the key designer for the collection, the Brit also models in the campaigns . Sixties inspired: Alexa revealed to WWD.com that the collection was inspired by a late sixties aesthetic . Wardrobe essentials: Alexa's AG collection includes a number of casual and relaxed pieces, from shorts to mini skirts . Sweater style: The collection draws on Alexa's own unique fashion sense, which has seen her hailed as one of the world's most stylish women . The former TV presenter also revealed that she had paid a trip to the AG factory, in order to get a real taste for how the company operated - and to learn how exactly her pieces would be made, from start to finish. 'I found the trip incredibly inspiring and an opportunity to learn about denim and make things I had been dreaming about finding,' she added. While the exact prices of each piece are not yet available, AG has confirmed that the collection, which will officially launch on January 15, will be priced between $70 and $300. It is not the first time that Alexa has put her design skills to the test. In 2010, the socialite announced a collaboration with popular main street store Madewell, revealing at the time that, while she was responsible for sketching the inspiration for each piece in the collection, it was the company's brand directors who helped her to bring them all to life. Retro-inspired: Each of the pieces, which will be priced between $70 and $300, has a laid-back, casual feel . Blue denim: In order to promote the collection, Alexa also released a short film, directed by Gia Coppola, in which she sings a rendition of Stevie Nicks' 1994 classic jean-inspired hit . Casual comfort: As well as the main denim collection, the range also includes T-shirts and sweaters . 'I can't take credit for the hard work at all because I just took sketches in and talked about them,' she told Glamour. 'Kin [Madewell's design director] was magical and made it all exist. It was good fun from my end. . . maybe not from hers. 'I drew really slightly rubbish drawings and then said, ""but can it have dots on it?"" 'It's actually a bit weird to see everyone walking around in the clothes today because they all look like me.' 'It's a very egotistical exercise.'","Alexa Chung launched her new range for AG Jeans at Selfridges tonight .

"Loading the dishwasher can be a sore subject. Everyone claims to have perfected their own foolproof 'technique', yet no two methods are the same. But now scientific research claims to have discovered the definitive way to organise a dishwasher's racks. And the study, which has provided the most detailed analysis of how water circulates inside a household dishwasher, even suggests that most people pack their appliance the wrong way. Scroll down for video . The findings has helped provide clues to the best way of loading a dishwasher by placing the dirtiest carbohydrate stained dishes in a circular pattern that matches the rotating arms inside dishwasher, as shown in the graphic above, while protein stained plates that need more detergent should be placed around the edges . After studying numerous cycles, experts concluded that the most efficient way to pack your dishwasher is in a circle around the cutlery basket. However, they warned that due to the way baskets are currently designed, this may prove to be difficult. Dr Raul Pérez-Mohedano, who led the work at the department of chemical engineering at the University of Birmingham using a technique known as Positron Emission Particle Tracking, also suggested packing the dishes according to the type of stain they contain. He said that carbohydrate-based stains such as potato and tomato need the full force of the water jets to get clean, while protein based foods such as dried egg yolk needs more contact with the chemical detergent. In the study, engineers used radioactive isotopes to monitor the speed and direction that the jets of water travel when the device is in use. They found that while the entire interior of the dishwater will get wet during a cycle, it will not necessarily clean everything in the same way. This explains why in some cases a particularly stubborn piece of burnt food can be washed off in a wash cycle, while other lighter stains can be baked on. A recent trend for money saving has seen people using their dishwashers for some rather unusual household tasks. Using watertight bags and containers, some householders have been using their dishwashers to cook their food alongside their daily plate and glass cleaning. They claim that by using the heat creating inside the dishwasher to cook a meal every day, it is possible to save more then £150 a year. Entire cookbooks have been created, suggesting dishes such as couscous, salmon, veal and tuna. Some have even cooked their Christmas Turkey inside their dishwasher. Others have tried to take advantage of the cleaning power of the automatic dish cleaning device to clean other household objects. Computer keyboards have been cleaned on warm washes without detergent before being allowed to dry out, although no manufacturers recommend this. Online forums are also filled with ideas for washing muddy Wellington boots, scrubbing potatoes, polishing old toys and perking up dusty lampshades. Dr Pérez-Mohedano said: 'The distribution of water inside a commercial dishwasher is very chaotic. 'Areas with a direct impact from the water jets are very localised and these are only able to cover a very small area of all the crockery surface present.' Instead, most of the water coverage is caused by water falling back down through the dishes, in what Dr Pérez-Mohedano describes as being like 'small waterfalls'. He found that water took an average of just a tenth of a second to run off plates stacked in a dishwasher. The findings suggest that the best way to pack a dishwasher would be to place the dishes in a circular pattern to ensure they get hit by the jets of water. The area between 30cm (11 inches) and 60cm (23 inches) were sprayed with the fastest moving water. This means that the area immediately above the rotating arms of the dishwasher and in the centre of the top shelf appear to be the best places to put dishes cemented with mashed potato that need the full force of the water. The study also showed that the areas towards the edges of the dishwasher basket on the bottom shelf tend to be where water travels slower. It found that the lowest velocities for the water were close to the walls of the dishwasher at a height between 5cm (2 inches) and 20cm (8 inches). The researchers measured the velocity of water as it moved around the dishwasher when unloaded and loaded as seen in the graphs above. The top line of diagrams show how the water moved when it was sprayed upwards while the bottom line shows how the water fell back down. A and B are unloaded. C-E are loaded . The researchers used Positron Emission Particle Tracking, seen in the picture above, to monitor how radioactive particles moved around inside commercially available household dishwashers as they worked . This means that the detergent will have more time to work on dishes in these areas, making them the ideal place to put egg and custard covered plates. It is probably the best place to stack any delicate china crockery that should not be exposed to the full force of the water jets. Loading dishes with food like egg on the bottom towards the outside, as in the picture on the left, will improve the way they are cleaned but overloading a dishwasher will cause food to be baked onto dishes (right) This video shows a more modern dishwasher with the rotating arm similar to that used by the scientists . Dr Pérez-Mohedano, whose study is published in the Chemical Engineering Journal, said that many of the recommended methods of packing offered in the user manuals of commercial dishwashers did not provide the most effective cleaning. He said: 'Current commercial dishwashers also show a problem of symmetry - while the ejection of water is produced in a circular movement, the distribution of the crockery follows a rectangular pattern. 'This automatically produces areas where the impact of water is going to occur for longer. 'Depending of the soil type to remove, the best procedure to follow varies. For example, cleaning of protein based soils, such as egg yolk, requires of an initial swelling/hydration stage which is typically driven by high alkaline conditions at the beginning of the wash-cycle. 'Afterwards, cleaning occurs by detachment soil layers from top to bottom following hydrolysis reactions. 'Other types of soils based on carbohydrates, like tomato paste, require less chemistry and more mechanical action. 'They are detached in patches of different sizes in a process known as adhesive failure. ' Dr Pérez-Mohedano, who worked with engineers from manufacturer Whirlpool and Procter and Gamble on the study, also cautioned against overloading the dishwasher. The study found that plates and other dishes essentially create as series of small 'walls' that block the cycle of water around the appliance. The more dishes that are crammed into the dishwasher, the more they stop water reaching from all the areas where they are needed. Dr Pérez-Mohedano now hopes that the findings can be used to design more efficient and effective automatic dishwashers. He said: 'In my personal opinion a redesign of the way of distribution of water is necessary. 'There are some ideas out there that have been or are ready to be commercialised.' Indeed, some manufacturers such as Samsung have attempted to tackle the problem with the flow of water by using moving lines of water jets that create a wall of water that moves through the dishwasher. Some curious homeowners have used waterproof GoPro cameras to film inside dishwashers and the results show just how erratic the jets of water can be in some modesl - it is surprising the dishes get cleaned at all .","Engineers at the University of Birmingham tracked water movement inside empty and fully loaded household dishwashers using radioactive isotopes .
They found the water was most powerful close to the jets on the rotating arms and about 60cm (23 inches) up from the bottom of the appliance .
This is the best place for crockery caked with stubborn carbohydrate food .
Dishes packed close to the walls on the lower shelf are allowed to soak in detergent for longer making them ideal for cleaning protein like egg yolk .
The researchers say overloading stops water to reaching all the surfaces .
They are working with manufacturers to produce new dishwasher designs ."
"Newly elected Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst will deliver the Republican Party's official response next Tuesday after President Barack Obama's delivers his State of the Union address, marking the first such honor for a politician best known for castrating hogs in her youth. Ernst, 44, is the first woman to serve in Congress from the state of Iowa, winning a seat that Democrat Tom Harkin had held for two decades. She won't break any ground for the GOP on Tuesday, however: Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers delivered the response speech last year. Republicans gave the job to women three times during the Bill Clinton presidency. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . LET'S MAKE 'EM SQUEAL: Ernst came to prominence with a folksy ad that emphasized her childhood chore castrating hogs on a farm . The newly minted Iowa senator could take on any number of Obama-favored policies in her speech next Tuesday, including the Affordable Care Act . But her fresh face will present what the president's opponents hope is a personable image going into the 2016 election season. Ernst made national news last year when she launched her campaign with a TV ad playing up a childhood that she spent working on her family's farm – including some chuckle-worthy chores. 'I grew up castrating pigs on an Iowa farm,' she said in the campaign ad. 'So when I get to Washington, I'll know how to cut pork.' After a message flashes across the screen about balancing the federal budget, she comes back to observe that 'Washington's full of big spenders. Let's make 'em squeal!' A House Republican staffer told DailyMail.com that Ernst was picked in part because of the ad and the public name-recognition it gave her. The aide, who requested anonymity, said Ernst 'will be a breath of fresh air, and hopefully she'll do what she does best: cut someone's cojones off.' Top Republicans beamed on Thursday as they announced their pick. Republicans have put up seven different speakers to respond to President Barack Obama's State of the Union speeches, including the 2009 address which was considered merely an 'address to a joint session of Congress': . February 24, 2009 – Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal . January 27, 2010 – Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell . January 25, 2011 – Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan . January 24, 2012 – Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels . February 12, 2013 – Florida Senator Marco Rubio . January 28, 2014 – Washington Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers . January 20, 2015 – Iowa Senator Joni Ernst . 'She is a perfect choice. Americans voted for change,' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said, standing alongside House Speaker John Boehner. They spoke at a joint retreat of House and Senate Republicans in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Ernst is an Iraq War veteran and lieutenant colonel in the Iowa National Guard. She told reporters that when she was growing up on a farm in Southwest Iowa, she never would have imagined having such an opportunity. 'Our folks back home sent us to Washington, D.C., with a clear mission and that mission is to get to work,' she said. 'I am truly honored,' she added in a written statement. 'During this Congress, we must help grow a vibrant economy, see to it that our veterans receive promised quality care and that our military has the tools to defend our nation's security, and ensure the federal government begins to run more effectively and efficiently.' A WOMAN'S PLACE IS IN THE HOUSE: Cathy McMorris Rodgers, now part of the GOP House leadership team, gave the response address last year . AWKWARD: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio became an Internet sensation when he paused for a drink in the middle of his speech . Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (left) responded to Obama in 2009 and gave a wooden performance that was widely mocked; in 2010 it was then-Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell's turn (right) – but he'll soon be giving all his speeches from behind bars . McConnell boasted that Ernst 'is a mother, a soldier, and an independent leader who serves in Washington because Americans voted for change in the last election.' Boehner said 'she knows that our federal government is too big, our spending is too high, and our tax code is broken. And, she knows first-hand the sacrifices our men and women in uniform make to keep us all safe in a dangerous world.' Obama delivers the State of the Union address on Tuesday. It is customary for the party not in power in the White House to be granted national television time for a response to the president's speech. In this case, Republicans hold control of both houses of Congress for the first time since Obama took office in 2009. Delivering the response to the State of the Union can sometimes prove a perilous turn in the spotlight. Two years ago, Sen. Marco Rubio was ridiculed after lurching for a drink of water in the middle of his response, and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is still remembered for his awkward performance back in 2009. Virginia's then-Gov. Bob McDonnell had the honor in 2010. He's scheduled to report to federal prison on Feb. 9 to begin a two-year sentence for corruption in office.","First female senator in Iowa's history made national news with eye-catching campaign ads about castrating pigs on her family's farm .

"Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell has hit back after he was caught on CCTV in a bitter altercation with a member of the public. CCTV footage shows the former press secretary to Tony Blair push away a man who abused him in a back street in Hampstead, north London. Mr Campbell has now denied claims he punched and spat at the man, who called him: 'The biggest piece of s*** I’ve ever seen in this street.' Scroll down for video . Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alastair Campbell has denied hitting and spitting at a man during an altercation in a north London street, which was captured on CCTV. The footage shows Mr Campbell (right of picture) enter the street after he had been jogging and a man (left of picture) walking towards him . The man appears to say something to the controversial political figure and later revealed he told Mr Campbell he was 'the biggest piece of s*** I’ve ever seen in this street' The footage came to light after the man, who has not been named, went to former Labour MP George Galloway to tell him about the run-in with Mr Campbell. The 61-year-old father-of-three involved later told local paper Ham & High that Mr Campbell 'struck out' and 'hit me on my shoulder' after he made the remark. He added: 'I turned to confront him and said ""That is assault, you should be in prison"". 'At which point spitting ensued and then I aimed a blow with my foot that did not connect. Nothing that I did was illegal and he had no right to punch me.' Mr Campbell, 57, has completely denied spitting at the man, but says 'minimal' contact was made  to stop the man coming any closer. The CCTV appears to show Mr Campbell push the man away from him before they go out of shot as the argument continues. The man involved then comes back into shot and appears to shout something down the street before walking off. Mr Campbell has been a senior figure in Labour  for many years and is currently advising Ed Miliband . Mr Campbell says he put out an arm to keep the man away from him as they came together in the road . Mr Campbell wrote on his website today: ‘I was walking down Perrin’s Lane last Monday after a run in Hampstead when a man walking towards me began shouting in abusive and aggressive terms as he approached. 'As I passed him I did not look at him, did not respond to his insults and put my arm out to his shoulder to stop him coming any closer. If there was any contact at all it was minimal. 'I walked on a few steps, thought he was doing the same but he turned back, followed me, continued to abuse me and when I turned around he came towards me and aimed a kick at me which came into brief contact with my leg. 'He then moved back but he came forward again and spat at me, most of the spit landing on my shirt, some on my face. I then turned and walked away. 'He continued to shout abuse as he walked in the other direction. I am confident that any full CCTV coverage of the incident would show all this to be the case.' The man then turns and an argument appears to ensue as he follows Mr Campbell down the road . Moments later, after Mr Campbell says he was kicked and spat at, the man re-appears and walks off . Mr Campbell says the response to the incident was stirred up by former Labour MP George Galloway, who tweeted this message after the man spoke to him . Mr Campbell added: 'The claim he subsequently made to George Galloway and to which Galloway drew attention on social media – suggesting that I punched and spat at him – is totally untrue, indeed close to being the opposite of the truth. 'The fact that he went to Galloway rather than the police, does not wish to be identified, and wishes to have his claims made anonymously through Galloway’s office, speaks volumes. 'I have kept the shirt unwashed should this go any further, though given the police have better things to do with their time, I have no interest in pressing charges.' He has called on Camden council to release any CCTV which may show the whole incident. Mr Campbell, who lives near where the incident happened, gained a reputation for having a hot temper while working with the Labour government. His management style is said to be the inspiration for Malcolm Tucker, the foul-mouthed fictional spin doctor in The Thick Of It TV series and the  film In The Loop.","Former party press secretary abused by man in London street last week .

"President Obama's chief spokesman refused on Thursday to rule out the possibility that the U.S. will strike a nuclear deal with Iran while the Islamic Republic holds several Americans captive – including a Washington Post journalist being tried by the mullahs' Revolutionary Court without public notice of the charges. The case is the mirror opposite of Cuba, where the White House announced steps toward normalizing diplomatic relations on the condition that President Raul Castro release American Alan Gross and a Cuban citizen who had been a U.S. intelligence asset. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said efforts to slow down Tehran's ability to create fissionable nuclear material that could be used in long-range weapons remain unrelated to the administration's attempts to free four Americans. 'These two priorities have been raised on two separate tracks, but they are priorities nonetheless,' he said. NOT RULING IT OUT: White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the U.S. isn't linking the releas of prisoners in Iran to a nuclear deal with the Islamic republic . CHUMMY: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (left) and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif (right) discussed the cases of Americans held by Tehran this week but no resolution was reached . Earnest did reiterate the Obama administration's call for their release, but said balancing the intertwined hostage and nuclear talks is 'one of the more vexing and far-reaching policy challenges' facing the West Wing and the State Department. The captives include Washington Post correspdent and Iranian-American Jason Rezaian, and Americans Amir Hekmati, Saeed Abedini and Robert Levinson. Levinson is officially considered 'missing' because Iran hasn't acknowledged holding him. Hekmati has been detained in Iran since August 2011 'on false espionage charges while visiting his family in Iran,' according to the U.S. State Department. Abedini has been held since September 2012 and was sentenced to eight years in prison for 'undermining national security' – in reality a prosecution for helping Christians operate 'home churches' that provide places for Iran's estimated 700,000 non-Muslims to worship. At the time of his arrest, Abedini was building a state-approved orphanage. Levinson went missing in March 2007 on Kish Island, a place that foreigners can visit without visas. Oran hasn't denied holding him. Rezaian was scheduled to appear before a Revolutionary Court tribunal on Thursday. 'The White House is certainly aware of Iranian press reports stating that Jason Rezaian's case has been referred to a court,' Earnest told reporters. 'We continue to monitor the situation closely and to seek further information,' and 'call for his immediate release.' He said Secretary John Kerry had raised the Rezaian case during a meeting this week with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif . 'Secretary Kerry raised Mr. Rezaian's case,' Earnest said. 'That is an indication of how seriously the United States takes this case.' Kerry, he said, also called for the release of the other three captives. But 'at the same time,' Earnest insisted, 'we've also been explicit about the fact that these conversations, while important, are separate' from negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. ON TRIAL BUT NO PUBLIC CHARGES: Jason Rezaian, an Iranian-American correspondent for the Washington Post, has been indicted on unspecified charges and faces trial by a Revolutionary Court – a process usually reserved for national security crimes . HELD: Saaed Abedini (left) and Amir Hekmati (center) are definitely being detained by Iran's Islamic government, while Bob Levinson (right)is officially missing but assumed to be a captive . 'These two priorities have been raised on two separate tracks, but they are priorities nonetheless.' 'We believe these American citizens should be released,' Earnest told reporters. ""And we also believe the Iranian regime should take the steps that are necessary' to end crippling economic sanctions and bring transparency to its nuclear ambitions. He dismissed concerns that President Obama has treated Iran with kid gloves, compared with his insistence that Cuba release prisoners before a diplomatic deal could move forward. Even with an agreement on the hostages, Earnest said, 'the relations between the U.S. and Iran would fall far from normal.' He cited 'their rhetoric and treatment of Israel,' and said 'there are a whole host of concerns we have with the Iranians.' 'Our concerns with Iran,' he said, 'are part of a much longer list.' The U.S. remains opposed to Iran's nuclear program. According to the White House, Obama told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday that America 'is focused on reaching a comprehensive deal with Iran that prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and verifiably assures the international community of the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear program.'","Obama press secretary says nuclear talks are on a 'separate track' from efforts to free Americans held by Tehran .

"Joseph Crystal was a rising star in the Baltimore police department, but when he reported a fellow officer for violently assaulting a drug suspect he was bullied until he felt compelled to resign . Joseph Crystal was a rising star in the Baltimore police department, making arrests that made the TV news – but when he reported a fellow officer for violently assaulting a drug suspect he claims he was bullied until he felt compelled to resign. Crystal witnessed a colleague beat up a suspect so brutally that he was left with a broken ankle, but after reporting the matter to his superior, rather than turn on the misguided policeman, he says his department turned on him. 'If you snitch, your career is done, ' he says he was told. He was labelled a rat, had a dead rat left on his car windshield and one colleague told him 'to pray you're not the star witness', it has been reported. And on more than one occasion, the policeman alleges, his colleagues refused to provide back up as he tackled suspects. 'I never imagined that doing the right thing as a cop could cost me so much,' Crystal, 31, told the New York Daily News. The alleged harassment was all the more shocking given that Crystal was one of Baltimore's outstanding officers. Crystal now works for the Walton County Sheriff's Office in Florida, but is suing his old department over his treatment. Police work was in his blood. The son of two NYPD officers, Crystal flew through the ranks, becoming a detective within two years of joining the force and eventually heading up a violent crime unit. Crystal said that he rose through the force 'like a rocket', describing his role as 'a dream come true'. But on October 27, 2011, everything changed – the dream becoming a total nightmare, he claims. Along with other members of his Violent Crime Impact Section, that night he witnessed a drug suspect, Antoine Green, escape an arrest on foot. Desperate to get off the street, Green kicked in the door of a nearby house and took refuge. The house happened to belong to the girlfriend of a Baltimore policeman called Anthony Williams, who naturally dialled 911. Green was subsequently picked up – but then Williams showed up, while off duty, and was seen by Crystal having a conversation with another officer, Sergeant Marinos Gialamas, who was still at the scene. Green would later reveal that Gialamas told Williams that he would 'take care of it'. What Crystal saw next totally shocked him. The van containing Green returned to the house and he was taken back inside and viciously beaten up. Crystal said: 'I can hear the assault. I hear the banging. I hear the guy hit the floor. Ostracised: Joseph Crystal claims that even his police chief failed to stop the abuse he received at the Baltimore police department (file picture . 'A couple minutes later, they bring the guy out. His shirt's ripped. He's having trouble standing. Later on, I found out his ankle was broken. It was obvious not just to any cop but to any person that saw it what had just transpired.' Crystal said he felt he had no choice but to report the crime – and his parents agreed. But when he did, he said he became vilified. He alleges that his immediate boss declared: 'If you snitch, your career is done. Nobody's going to work with you.' Colleagues openly called him a rat and a snitch, he said. One left a drawing of a rat and cheese on his desk. 'People don't like you,' he was told. And, says Crystal, there was no let up. He claims that someone set up a fake Twitter account in his name, sending 'confessions' to reporters that he was committing adultery, officers refused to accompany him on patrol and he was even ordered to retreat from the arrest of a drug dealer by his boss because no one would provide assistance. What's more, he said, his security clearance was revoked, he was demoted to night-shift patrol work and his colleagues began to threaten him ahead of Williams and Gialamas' trial, the pair having been charged over the assault in October 2012. On one disturbing occasion a sergeant rang him and said 'you better pray to God that you're not the star witness', Crystal told the New York Daily News. The abuse wasn't confined to work, either, he alleges. After Thanksgiving on November 2012 someone placed a dead rat on the windshield of his car, while parked on the driveway of his home. Crystal says that at this point his wife became 'hysterical'. Promises that the perpetrators would be rooted out by police chief Anthony Batts came to nothing, Crystal said. 'How do you expect people to trust cops when they let this happen?' he said. After a trial in February 2014 in which Crystal testified, Williams was found guilty of assault and obstruction of justice and jailed for 45 days and Gialamas found guilty of misconduct and put on probation. Crystal regarded himself as a police officer with plenty of resilience, but the alleged harassment eventually overwhelmed him and he resigned from the force in August 2014, his ostracisation having continued even after the trial wrapped up. He is suing the Baltimore police department for $2.5million. Crystal's attorney, Don Discepolo, said: 'Actions like those taken within the Baltimore City Police Department tarnish the badge of law enforcement, add to the growing tension between police and community, and form an ever more divisive sense of trust within the public at-large. 'Joseph Crystal acted in good faith, as any responsible individual citizen would, and we are proud to represent him for his courageousness in standing tall against poor judgment and inexcusable actions of his colleagues and superiors.'","Joseph Crystal was a rising star in the Baltimore police department .

"Two migrants have been arrested after allegedly going berserk and killing ten passengers aboard a boat heading from Africa to Spain after believing that a priest's prayers caused bad weather. The pair are accused of hitting their victims with wooden planks which they then used to push them overboard during a row which began when a Nigerian priest started praying because he feared bad weather would capsize the boat. Police believe the alleged killers wrongly interpreted the priest's prayers as the cause of the bad weather, leading them to kill up to ten passengers on the boat that eight babies perished on. Two migrants have been arrested after allegedly going berserk and killing ten passengers aboard a boat heading from Africa to Spain (file picture) They are also suspected of robbing their victims - mostly Nigerians - of around £1,200 before pushing them to their deaths. Only 29 of the 50 people who boarded the rickety boat in Nador, Morocco, after paying smugglers to help them reach Spain, made it to Europe. Eight babies were among those who went overboard as the boat was rocked by choppy seas. A three-year-old girl was the only child survivor along with 28 other adults when rescuers reached it off the coast of Almeria, south east Spain, in early December. The youngsters had been travelling with their pregnant mothers in the hope of a better life in Europe. Sisqo Bambola, the father of twin boys who lost their life in the tragic voyage, later posted a photo of the youngsters with their mum on his Facebook page, announcing: 'Bereavement notice to all those who have known Sisqo Bambola's twins. This is their photo. They died in Spanish waters.' African migrants seeking a better life in Europe often try to reach Spain by crossing the Mediterranean Sea, while others try crossing through Spanish enclaves in north Africa (file picture) News of the arrests came as a shock in Spain, where it had been assumed all the victims died because of the bad weather. Police said their suspicions were first aroused when they noticed the survivors went out of their way to avoid contact with the Cameroonian pair, who have not been named.

"Master of disguise: Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau points at the camera as he delivers one of his regular fanatical rants to the world . The man orchestrating the deadly Boko Haram massacres in Nigeria is a boastful lunatic who revels in slaughter and chaos and is a 'master of disguise'. Bloodthirsty Abubakar Shekau is one of the world’s most wanted men, with American authorities putting a $7million bounty on his head. Shekau – said to be to fluent in four languages – also operates under a variety of different names which has only increased the mystery surrounding his true identity. The elusive Islamist fanatic has led his brutal Boko Haram militants since 2009 into war in Africa, killing more than an estimated 16,225 people in that time. The latest outrage he has led was the massacre of an estimated 2,500 people in northern Nigeria when his thugs razed two towns. Last week, the terror group shocked the world when they are believed to have used girls as young as 10 as suicide bombers in two deadly attacks in northern Nigeria that killed at least 19 people. Experts claim psychotic Shekau  rarely communicates directly with members of the terror group and instead deals only with a handful of confidantes - much like former Al Qaeda terror chief Osama bin Laden. Files on the US State Department of Justice claim he variously operates under identities that include Darul Tawheed, Abu Bakr Skikwa, Imam Abu Bakr Shiku, Abu Muhammad Abu Bakr Bin Muhammad Al Shakwi Al Muslimi Bishku and Abubakar Shakkau. Scroll down for video . Lunatic: Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau rants in a still image taken from an undated video released by the Nigerian Islamist terror group . Mystery: Shekau operates under a number of different names, only adding to the mystery surrounding his true identity . Menace: Shekau glares at the camera as he delivers his chilling messages of terror to the world with a gun strapped to his chest . The four languages he speaks are listed as Arabic, Hausa, Fulani and Kanuri. Even his age remains unknown, with predictions between 38 and 49 believed to be most accurate. Shekau is believed to have a wife and three children, although their whereabouts also remain unknown. The Nigerian military has claimed several times to have killed the fanatic - only for him to appear in new videos proving he is still alive. After one recent claim, he appeared in video to taunt the military's claims and laughed: 'Here I am, alive. I will only die the day Allah takes my breath.' Boko Haram – which means ‘Western education is forbidden' in Arabic – have shocked the world with their merciless slaughter of innocent men, woman and children across the north of Nigeria. Shekau claimed leadership of the terror group in 2010, and was seen last week in a video praising the jihadists who murdered 17 people in the Paris attacks. He has been variously described as ‘fearless’, a ‘gangster’ and a ‘loner’, which security sources believe give him an air of invincibility which makes him extremely dangerous. The Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium has described Shekau as a ‘religious intellectual, yet also a gangster and vigilante as well as a mad leader’. Kidnap: A still image from a video where Shekau claimed Boko Haram were responsible for the kidnap of almost 300 schoolgirls . Innocent victims: Kidnapped schoolgirls are seen at an unknown location in this image taken from a video released by Boko Haram. The girls went missing in April 2014. Under Shekau’s leadership, Boko Haram has continually targeted young children. In April 2014, Boko Haram kidnapped close to 300 girls from their school in Chibok in Borno State in northern Nigeria. In a video message released three weeks later, Shekau claimed responsibility for the kidnappings, calling the girls slaves and threatening to sell them. He boasted: 'I abducted your girls. There is a market for selling humans. Allah says I should sell. He commands me to sell.' Their disappearance prompted a social media campaign with #bringbackourgirls, which was supported by Michelle Obama, First Lady of the USA. Support: Michelle Obama supported the #bringbackourgirls campaign after the kidnap . Rumours also abound that Shekau escaped from the Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital in the Nigerian city of Maiduguri during the 1990s. The fanatic regularly appears in videos to taunt the Nigerian military over their failings to prevent his group’s killings. In one of Shekau's first videos, believed to have appeared online in 2012, the insurgent leader boasted of his bloodlust and said: ‘I enjoy killing...the way I enjoy slaughtering chickens and rams.’ It is believed the terrorist was born in Shekau village that borders Niger to poor farmer parents. They are then thought to have migrated south into northeast Nigeria. A religious young man, he studied basic Islamic theology, before focusing on more hardline Sunni ideology and becoming a preacher. In a 2012 interview, Grema Kawudima said Shekau was remembered as 'an easy-going fellow who would exchange banter with people in the neighbourhood. He was popular...a local theology student'. After his religious studies, he is then understood to have attended Borno State College of Legal and Islamic Studies for higher studies on Islam. He became increasingly radicalised and seized control of Boko Harem after founder Mohammed Yusuf was killed in a security crackdown on the terror group in 2009. Since then, Shekau has pursued a relentless campaign of terror as the group has strengthened its deadly grip in Nigeria. Recent satellite images from Amnesty International revealed the full scale of the devastation wreaked by Boko Haram when they slaughtered an estimated 2,500 people in the towns of Baga and Doron Baga in early January. In the pictures taken beforehand, the areas in red show buildings and trees in the densely packed towns in the north of the country. But in the pictures taken after the massacre, they have been decimated and the infra-red satellite images instead reveal grey areas where the militants savagely razed the towns. Daniel Eyre, Nigeria researcher for Amnesty International, said the attack was the 'largest and most destructive' Boko Haram assault his organisation has ever analysed. He added: 'These detailed images show devastation of catastrophic proportions in two towns, one of which was almost wiped off the map in the space of four days. 'It represents a deliberate attack on civilians whose homes, clinics and schools are now burnt out ruins.' Before: Infra-red images show the densely populated village of Doron Baga on January 2 - before the attack .

"Police are believed to have located the father of the baby left for dead by a 30-year-old Samoan woman in western Sydney last November and are waiting to interview him. Penrith Local Court was told on Friday that prosecutors in the case of attempted murder against the woman were waiting for a statement from the baby's father. Daily Mail Australia has learned the woman had a boyfriend of Samoan ancestry, who may be the father of child. Police have yet to reveal whether the father was aware of the woman's pregnancy during the nine months she hid her condition from relatives and friends. During her pregnancy, the accused boasted about a new boyfriend and posted a photograph of the two of them on her Facebook page. Scroll down for video . Father located: Police are believed to have located the father of the baby (pictured at the moment he was saved) who was retrieved from a stormwater drain last November five days after the newborn was allegedly abandoned by his mother . Baby in a drain: The five day old baby boy (left) who miraculously survived after being dumped down this drain (right) by his mother on the day of his birth during hot Spring conditions in western Sydney . The NSW Department of Public Prosecutions is still gathering evidence for its case of attempted murder against the bay's mother. The DPP has yet to finalise interviews with staff at Blacktown hospital where the infant boy was born, medical and hospital records and CCTV footage from locations where the mother went after leaving the hospital and dumping the hours old child in the stormwater drain in western Sydney. The accused, who has been held in Silverwater Women's Correctional Centre for seven weeks since her arrest for attempted murder of her son, did not appear via audio visual link from jail in Penrith Local Court during a very brief hearing before Magistrate Roger Clisdell. She is now due to next appear on March 13. Friends of the woman have rallied around her posting messages of support on her Facebook page saying 'God will find an answer' and her situation will be resolved 'through prayer'. The woman, who is the daughter of a Seventh Day Adventist pastor in Samoa, had been living with her aunt and uncle in the western Sydney suburb of Quakers Hill when she became pregnant and kept her condition secret for nine months. After giving birth to a healthy baby boy at Blacktown hospital at 1am on November 18, she discharged herself early that afternoon and, police allege, took her baby and placed him in a stormwater drain around 500m from her home. The baby was apparently put through a small opening under the concrete slab over the drain and fell the 2.5m drop to the bottom.The baby lay undisovered for five days in hot dry conditions. On the morning of Sunday, November 23, Sydney man David Otte and his daughter Hayley, heard cries coming from a drain as they were cycling near the M7 motorway. They stopped, thinking it was a trapped small animal, and then called emergency services when they saw it was a baby. Police from Quakers Hill Local Area Command retrieved the baby, which was wrapped in a pink striped blanket, from the drain. Relatives of the woman accused of trying to murder her baby arrive at a house in western Sydney following her arrest and first court appearance on the charges last year . Distraught: The auntie of the woman accused of attempting to kil her own child is comforted on Facebook late last year (above) by relatives and friends who appear distraught and still bewildered at the events . The five-day-old infant was taken to hospital, where it was found he was severely dehydrated and had bleeding on the brain. Now just over eight weeks old, the baby has been released from hospital and is in care. Doctors said the baby was able to survive in the drain because of a lack of rain causing storm water which might have drowned him, along with newborns' natural ability to survive without food or water. After police tracked down the mother, she was charged with attempted murder and has been held in a Sydney women's prison for the last three weeks. Magistrate Clisdell said the woman was still bail refused. The one day old baby boy was pushed through the tiny opening of this stormwater drain (pictured) in western Sydney. If not for dry Spring weather, the newborn might have drowned . While she has been accused of dumping her day-old baby down a drain and leaving him to die, the 30-year-old is also thought to be a loving aunt who adores children and appears entirely devoted to her family in Australia and Samoa, Daily Mail Australia can reveal. One of her social media accounts is filled with pictures of babies and young relatives. A family friend has told Daily Mail Australia that the young woman - who goes by an anglicised nickname and works in western Sydney - 'loves children and is very good with children'. The son of a Seventh Day Adventist pastor, who leads the church attended by the woman and her family, told Daily Mail Australia that his father had spoken to the woman in prison late last year. Relatives of the accused woman (pictured leaving Blacktown Court last November) have been left distraught and confused about the 30-year-old's alleged dumping of her newborn son in a drain . The accused woman's aunt (pictured, left) said she did not know who the father of her niece's baby could be, but police have now located the man . Relatives at the house where the accused woman hid her pregnancy last year before giving birth to the boy she dumped . He said she 'was trying to keep on top of things' while incarcerated in a Sydney jail, believed to be the Silverwater Women's Correctional Centre. He described her as a 'very happy person' who was 'very good around children and young people at the church'. He said that she is 'a quiet girl' but that 'she's an island girl, so she's got a bit of bite in her' and that might help her cope while in prison awaiting trial for attempted murder. The accused's social media account also reveals that in the months leading up to the day the woman secretly gave birth,  the woman posted photo after photo of newborn relatives with loving messages. 'Happy  Eleven Weeks Princess', she has posted with double pictures of an infant dressed in pink. In another post from earlier this year, below a photograph of her with a relative's baby, she says, 'Awww, it's mine'. Another post with photos of the same baby dressed in a singlet and nappy has 'I love you' written with the accused's name next to it. In earlier posts, the young woman's life appears to revolve around her work friends, family and the church. Last year, she posted a birthday message to her aunt, with whom she was living in Quakers Hill until her arrest, saying 'Happy Birthday to the lady of our house an amazing, aunty, mom, chef ... hero!! Thank God for you [and] may our Good Lord continue to Bless you with many more years to come. Love you loads xox' The landlord of the house (pictured) where the young Samoan woman lived while hiding her secret pregnancy said he had  noticed she had 'put on weight' in the second half of last year . Miracle find: If David Otte and his daughter Hayley (pictured) had not been cycling past the stormwater drain last Sunday morning and heard the baby's cries, the newborn boy may have died and never been found . She also posted pictures of herself attending a church concert and celebrating birthdays with work friends. In a posting in March last year of herself with a young boy she says 'happy 4th birthday to my son' and says 'cant wait to c u again' and 'miss u mate'. The landlord of the house where the woman had been living with her extended family for at least two years said he had noticed the young woman had put on weight in the second half of last year. 'I was delivering the water bill and I saw she was bigger and wearing loose clothes, but I didn't say anything,' he said. 'They are a very good family, clean. I see them with their Bibles.'

"Daniyal Domine, pictured at Westminster Magistrates Court in Central London, is accused of stalking a Kings College lecturer . An infatuated student at a top university is facing harassment charges after writing love poems to his tutor before taking a ring to her office and trying to propose, a court heard. Daniyal Domine sent Christine Schallmoser romantic verses in English and German, asked her out for meals and to the theatre and penned an email saying 'you only live once', it was alleged. He went on to send her at least five 'distressing' emails, paid her at least ten 'unwarranted' visits and went to her office at King's College London with a ring to ask her to marry him, prosecutors said. Domine, 24 – who was an undergraduate studying German language at King's, where Miss Schallmoser is a German lecturer – is charged with harassing her between March 2013 and October last year. Details of the case emerged during a hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court last month, but for legal reasons the Daily Mail has not been able to disclose them until now. During the hearing, prosecutor Darren Watts said: 'It started off via email, it has then continued with the defendant entering the complainant's office . . . reaching a point where the defendant has refused to be moved from the locations.' Domine's alleged harassment began after he missed a class and asked Miss Schallmoser to send him work to catch up. After completing it, he insisted on taking it to her personally, the court heard. At a previous hearing, Miss Schallmoser said she first came into contact with Domine while she was teaching him German in 2012 to mid-2013. Initially it was the normal student-teacher relationship but then he started showing an 'inappropriate interest' in her, it was alleged. Miss Schallmoser said he handed in work in April 2013, along with an email in which he said 'you only live once'. He then sent her a poem and said he hoped it would bring her joy, the court heard. Domine also asked her to go out for a meal with him, the court heard, and Miss Schallmoser contacted his personal tutor to report his inappropriate activity. He then took a year off from university, but resumed his studies there last September. The student's alleged harassment began after he missed a class and asked Miss Schallmoser to send him work to catch up, the court heard . He emailed Miss Schallmoser asking her for help getting involved with the student newspaper, the court heard. She put him in contact with the editor and did not hear from him again for some time. Then, on October 8, she was told by a member of staff that he was waiting at her office, the court heard. The member of staff told Domine he should leave. But he made further visits to her office and ten phone calls to her on one day alone, Mr Watts said. When police were called, Domine told officers he was there to propose to Miss Schallmoser. Domine, who was living in a flatshare in London while studying at university, has not yet entered a plea. He was previously staying in a hospital psychiatric ward but has been allowed to return to stay with his parents – Stephen, 62, a retired company director, and Sara, 48 – at their £900,000 detached, five-bedroom house in Tunbridge Wells. At Southwark Crown Court yesterday, the Crown Prosecution Service agreed to drop the charge of stalking in favour of the lesser offence of harassment. Domine was released on conditional bail pending his next appearance before magistrates. Domine, who was living in a flatshare in London while studying at university, has not yet entered a plea .

"No, he didn't squeal like a girl. And unless you're a cricket supremo, don't diss his tattoo. When legendary cricketer Kevin Pietersen revealed his latest piece of body art overnight - a huge world map stretching from his chest to his back - some punters were quick to sledge his selection. England's Daily Express branded it 'shocking', TVNZ 'bizarre' and a BBC sportscaster simply described it as 'astonishing'. But Pietersen's acclaimed tattoo artist, Melbourne's Mick Squires, has now come out swinging in defence of his client's choice in an interview with Daily Mail Australia. 'It's his tattoo. At the end of the day if you can go and score as many centuries as he has and be able to and be able to put them on a world map then you've got something to say.' 'But if you can't, you should shut your mouth,' he said with a laugh. 'A little nervous': Cricketer Kevin Pietersen, pictured being inked with his world map tattoo by Mick Squires, did not squeal or move during the tattooing on Wednesday . Inked: The tattoo stretched from his chest to his back, with each place he had scored a ton highlighted with a red star .

Hailed the 'Wizard of Oz' by Tattoo Master magazine, Squires, 30 - who has a waiting list six months long - is highly regarded in the  tattoo artist community. The one-time IT worker, who said he 'never would have thought' his career would make such a drastic change, is the co-owner of Behind Closed Doors. It's a high-end private clinic in Northcote, north-east of Melbourne's CBD. It is a far cry from tattoo parlours where customers drunkenly stumble into at 4am to get inked with Chinese characters. Squires, who has travelled the world to teach his art and appeared at conventions in Berlin and London, is known for his breathtakingly detailed hyper-realistic portrait designs. Using relatively rare techniques, some of his stand-outs include his artwork of Breaking Bad character Walter White, pop star Rihanna with a snake biting her nose and Star Wars mainstays Darth Vader and Boba Fett. Squires has inked several sports stars. But as a 'massive cricket fan' planning to head to the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) next week, he said Pietersen's visit on Wednesday was a highlight.

Each mark represents a place that Pietersen has scored an international century for England - be it Test or ODI - including the United Kingdom, South Africa, Pakistan and Australia. The work took around an hour-and-a-half on Wednesday, Squires told Daily Mail Australia. The heavily-inked cricketer - known for his very patriotic Three Lions tat - was a little nervous. 'You know what he actually was quite good in getting tattoos,' Squires said. 'There was no squealing, no moving, nothing like that. He was pretty good. 'He was actually quite nervous but apart from that he wasn't too girly or anything.' Squires described Pietersen as a 'top bloke'.

"In the wake of the Paris terror attacks and the arrest last week of an Ohio man who was planning an all-out assault on the U.S. Capitol , the FBI is now revealing how they foiled a planned 2012 terrorist plot on American soil. Moroccan national Amine El-Khalifi, then 29, of Alexandria, Virginia, was arrested in a parking garage wearing what he thought was an explosive-laden suicide vest in hopes of blowing up the U.S. Capitol. He had gotten the vest from who he believed were al Qaeda operatives, but were in fact undercover FBI agents. Scroll down for video . Moroccan national Amine El-Khalifi was arrested in a parking garage in 2012 wearing what he thought was an explosive-laden suicide vest in hopes of blowing up the U.S. Capitol . The FBI had been following him for months, secretly filming him with undercover agents he thought were al Qaeda operatives . Now, the FBI has also released video to ABC News that was taken of El-Khalifi before he was apprehended, showing his excitement as he makes and tests bombs and plans his attack. In fact, when he sees the bomb explode, his first reaction is to say that it needs to be bigger to do more damage. 'It’s a striking moment,' says Assistant Director In Charge Andrew McCabe of the FBI's Washington Bureau. 'The message that you have to take away from seeing a tape like this is the understanding that these folks are out there.' McCabe's statements seem to be backed up by El-Khalifi's lack of remorse during his trial, with his only words to the judge being; 'I just want to say that I love Allah. That’s it.' El-Khalifi was apprehended after parking his car in the above garage and getting ready to walk into the Capitol . He had embarked on a largely self-taught rediscovery of his religion after a misdemeanor assault conviction in 2007, before which he had been active on the D.C. club scene, taking drugs and occasionally producing music according to prosecutors. He was ultimately sentenced to 30 years in prison, the maximum allowed under the plea deal he struck. He will be deported to Morocco after serving his sentence.","Moroccan national Amine El-Khalifi was arrested in 2012 wearing what he thought was an suicide vest in hopes of blowing up the U.S. Capitol .

"Forget making time for your family, the average British household manages to spend as little as three hours and six minutes of quality time together in a week, according to a new study. Long working hours, lengthy commutes and after school clubs mean parents can only spare an average 62 minutes to chat or play with their kids, on three typical week nights. And after chores and domestic duties, only five hours and nine minutes of play time are squeezed out of the average weekend. It has been revealed that the average British family only spends three hours and six minutes together a week . In fact, seven in ten of the 2,000 parents polled confessed the only real guaranteed quality time they spend with their family is on their one annual holiday. The poll also found that keeping fit was keeping the family apart with 35 per cent saying their family members take regular exercise, but mainly through solo activities such as gym workouts or P.E. lessons at school. For many of those polled quality time just simply isn't an option with a fifth of parents agreeing they never have a chance to do things as an entire family, as the kids' after-school clubs and parents' working late prevents them from returning home at the same time. A further 26 per cent said it's too hard to get the kids out of their bedrooms, while almost four in ten parents said they're usually glued to their phones or tablets. Even when it comes to the weekend Britain is struggling for time. With school and work commitments dominating the week, over half said that laundry, grocery shopping and 'life admin' are top priorities on Saturdays and Sundays. Weekends are also spent ferrying kids to football practice, the research showed, as well as their friends' houses and birthday parties. Work infiltrates home life with one in ten parents admitting to answering office emails in their downtime . And working life often spills over into the weekend for one in ten, who said they spend a lot of their 'down time' answering work emails. When they do get together as a family, eight in ten adults said their time is still spent separately - with family members often distracted by their phones or laptops. The majority of those surveyed (six in ten) agreed that when they spend time with a family member they would rather watch a film together than try a bonding family activity like swimming or a bike ride. A helpless 35 per cent of parents think their kids find family time 'boring', and admitted they struggle to find something to do that everyone can enjoy. Amazingly, the same amount said that their kids are so absent that most of their interaction is through texting or Facebook messaging rather than face to face. With so many obstacles, half of parents admitted they often feel like giving up on spending significant time with the children. School extra-curricular activities are another element that separates families during the week . Although over half agreed that exercising together is a great family activity, one in ten of the adults said they can only find the time for it once every month. A spokesman for David Lloyd Leisure, which commissioned the study, said: 'It seems everyone is leading very busy lives, but very little quality time is being spent together as a family. 'It's difficult to be upbeat after a hard day at work, and often we end up retiring to our rooms early. 'Being distracted by the internet, television and other modes of technology is also to blame.' The spokesman added that it is important for families to ditch their technical devices every now and then and spend some quality time together outdoors. 'Rather than parents and kids doing everything separately, families would benefit from finding things they can do together - like exercise.' 'These days everything we do is so tech-based, with handheld devices often stealing the show. 'Putting our phones and tablets down and getting out of the house to do something active together is great for bonding, and could inject some energy back into our family lives.'","UK families spend three hours and six minutes together a week .

"A man's survival after being struck by the deadly fangs of a King Brown snake has proven that Storm Trooper's armour really does saves lives. Scott Loxley, who has taken on the mammoth task of walking 5,000km around Australia in the Star Wars outfit for charity, has seen many a snake in the past 14 months. But it wasn't until Wednesday when he was leaving the one-horse town of Yalboroo in Queensland that he was attacked by one of the most venomous of the species. Although the armour, made out of ABS plastic and held together with fibre glass and tape, has clearly seen better days  - the attire served its purpose as Scott walked away with just a few scratches. A truly great story for the generations that would even make Darth Vadar beam with pride. Scroll down for video . Scott Loxley is walking 5,000km around Australia in a Storm Trooper outfit for charity and was struck by a King Brown snake on Wednesday . He luckily survived with just a few scratches but not before the snake followed Scott around his trolley and finally gave up about 30 seconds later - the weather-beaten armour saved the day . 'I thought it was a dead snake at first which I see all of the time,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was only a foot away when it reared up at me and bit my shin. 'I felt his teeth sink in but then slide down because he couldn't penetrate through the plastic.' The lethal fella did not stop there as he started to follow Scott around his trolley that he travels with. 'He was watching me and then following me,' he explained. 'I would move to the left around the trolley and so would he - then I would go to the right and then he would do the same.' The stand-off lasted for about 20-30 seconds before the scaly predator slithered away. Scott thought he was done for and waited for the pain to take hold but much to his surprise he was fine. 'I was pretty happy - I've had a lot of near misses and thought I was finally bitten after coming this far,' he laughed. 'He had his best shot and blew it.' Scott doesn't like to think of the alternative scenario as the place, with only a few houses, is a good 40 minutes from Mackay where the paramedics would have come from. 'I would have had to sit down, dial 000 and wait - I'm very lucky.' Scott lives off roadkill including snakes, lizards, goat and kangaroo for weeks at a time . His target is to raise $100,00 funds for Monash Children's Hospital in Melbourne . The 47-year-old left his hometown of Melbourne on November 2 last year to raise funds for the Monash Children's Hospital and hopes to see his wife and three children by July next year - or earlier if his weary blistered feet can get him there any sooner. The former soldier spends weeks at a time not speaking to anyone other than himself and the animals that cross his long endless dusty path - with fresh roadkill now a regular part of his daily diet. The simple rule of thumb that Scott abides by when deciding if the animal is safe to eat is 'if it's bloated I don't touch it - if it's still bleeding I eat it.' The tasty wildlife includes cooking lizards until crispy and putting them in ziplock bags to snack on during the trek and tying live snakes to his trolley until they are suitably fried by the sun. Scott, who says it all comes down to survival, has also feasted on a cow, goat and many a Kangaroo by cooking the meat on a wire grill. 'I can only carry so much food - it's not like there's always a servo up the road,' he said. 'I need the protein to keep going.' Scott has been travelling for just over 14 months now and hopes to make it back to Melbourne in July next year . The 47-year-old goes days and weeks without showering or talking to anybody . With only himself and the animals to talk to - Scott is quickly getting sick of his own compnay . He is currently in Coolalinga located 26 km southeast of Darwin in the Northern Territory . He was taught survival skills in the army but never used them to such an extreme until now. 'You pick up things along the way - it comes naturally because if you don't eat - you are going to die.' But don't feel too sorry for the lone adventurer - when Daily Mail Australia caught up with Scott he was chowing down on a Macca's Quarter Pounder meal  in Coolalinga - 26 km southeast of Darwin.

"It has long been thought that asteroids formed from planetary embryos known as protoplanets that eventually combined and led to the formation of fully-fledged planets. But, now a study claims that asteroids are not building blocks at all - but rather they were made from the collisions of these protoplanets. If true, the research would mean that meteorites on Earth are not a glimpse into a time before Earth was formed, and are instead merely a byproduct of our own planet's formation. Scientists at Purdue University in Louisiana have presented a new asteroid theory. They say asteroids may have formed during the collision of protoplanets (illustration shown). Such planetary embryos combined to create the terrestrial planets. Previously it was thought asteroids formed before the protoplanets . The new theory centres around tiny, glassy, spherical grains known as chondrules. These were once molten droplets, and are now found scattered over asteroids. It had been thought that chondrules were the early kernels of terrestrial planets. As the solar system started to pull together four billion years ago, these droplets collided with dust and gas, creating the early protoplanets. These were objects larger than an asteroid, but smaller than our moon in size, and they ultimately formed the terrestrial planets in the inner solar system today. An asteroid is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions in the early solar system. Most are located between Mars and Jupiter in the Main Belt. A comet is a rock covered in ice, methane and other compounds. Their orbits take them much further out of the solar system. A meteor is what we call a flash of light in the atmosphere when debris burns up. This debris itself is known as a meteoroid. Most are so small they are vapourised in the atmosphere. If any of this meteoroid makes it to Earth, it is called a meteorite. Meteors, meteoroids and meteorites normally originate from asteroids and comets. The scientists at Purdue University in Indiana, who carried out the latest research, however, say that chondrules actually formed after the protoplanets. They claim that when protoplanets in the early solar system collided, creating the planets, the collisions created asteroids as a byproduct. These bodies would have smashed together with such violent force that they melted a fraction of their material, and shot a molten plume out into the surrounding solar nebula. Droplets of this molten material would have eventually cooled to form chondrules, which in turn attached to larger bodies like asteroids - some of which would eventually impact Earth, to be preserved as meteorites. Dr Brandon Johnson, now a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told MailOnline that this new theory would apply to the more than 90 per cent of meteorites that contain abundant chondrules. Others that contain no chondrules ‘are likely more representative of the material that accreted to form planetesimals or planetary building blocks,’ he added. The new research is based on an analysis of how chondrules formed. These tiny, glassy, spherical grains - the circular objects on the meteorite seen here - are now thought to have formed in the collision of protoplanets in the early solar system, suggesting asteroids also formed around a similar time . Bodies in the solar nebula around the young sun (illustration shown) would have smashed together with such violent force that they melted a fraction of their material, and shot a molten plume out. Droplets of this molten material would have eventually cooled to form chondrules, which attached to larger bodies like asteroids . In the early solar system, collision speeds were much lower than they are now. The planetary embryos were no larger than Earth's moon and their collisions were relatively gentle, occurring at a speed of a few miles per second. For the most part, impacts at this speed would blast rock into broken fragments, but not melt it, allowing for the formation of asteroids with chondrules on them. Chondrules have long been a puzzling feature of meteorites and, if they weren't observable in meteorites, scientists would likely never have predicted their existence. ‘Chondrules are incredibly abundant and so they must be telling us something important about what conditions were like in the early solar system when the planets were forming,’ Dr Minton said. ‘We think collisions were common in the early solar system and that planets are built out of the collisions between smaller bodies, so an impact theory for the origin of chondrules fits well with what we know of how planets formed.’ If confirmed, this theory would give us a new understanding of our beginnings in the solar system - and suggest that most meteorites do not represent a time before Earth was born. ‘Chondrule-bearing meteorites have long been thought to be similar to the building blocks of planets,’ said Dr David Minton, an assistant professor of Earth, atmospheric and planetary science at Purdue, who was involved in the research. ‘This study suggests that instead chondrules might actually be byproducts of impacts between objects of an earlier generation, and meteorites may not be representative of the material that made planets.’ His colleague Dr Jay Melosh, a professor in the same department, added: ‘Understanding the origin of chondrules is like looking through the keyhole of a door; while we can't see all that is happening behind the door, it gives us a clear view of one part of the room and a glimpse into the very beginnings of our solar system. ‘We've found that an impact model fits extremely well with what we know about this unique material and the early solar system, and this suggests that, contrary to the current opinion among meteorite experts, asteroids are not leftover planet-building material and clumps of chondrules are not prerequisite to a planet.’ The method of chondrule creation suggested by the team revolves around something called ‘jetting’, which occurs at the beginning of an impact as the surfaces of two objects meet. The rock caught in the pinch between the colliding objects is compressed to high pressure and intensely heated, creating a bright flash. The heat is enough to melt rock and create droplets in the ejected debris that can become chondrules. An asteroid is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions in the early solar system. Most are located between Mars and Jupiter in the Main Belt. This illustration shows an asteroid breaking apart. Some asteroids are rich in metal, and it's thought others may have brought water to Earth . Meteorites that we find on Earth come from either asteroids or comets passing through the atmosphere and hitting the ground (illustration of an asteroid on approach shown). They were thought to be a snippet into the very young solar system, but may now be a snapshot of a later period .","Scientists at Purdue University in Indiana present new asteroid theory .

"A New York woman is suing a tights manufacturing company because their product didn't give her the orgasmic experience she had hoped for. Meng Wang, of Queens, purchased a pair of Kushyfoot shaping tights for $7 at Duane Reade and was disappointed -- or unsatisfied -- when she didn't have some sort of orgasmic experience that the woman in the company's advertising commercial had, according to the New York Post. In the sexually suggestive commercial for the pantyhose, a woman is seen walking down the street, seemingly in the throes of passion. Scroll down for video . A New York woman, Meng Wang, is suing a tights manufacturing company because the product didn't give her sexual pleasure as allegedly advertised in the product's sexually suggestive commercial . Between moans, the woman says 'that's the spot,' and 'oh yeah, that's it.' At the end of the commercial, the woman is surrounded by a group of women eager to know her secret and the woman pulls a package of the stockings from her purse and says 'Kushyfoot.' All the while, a chorus is heard in the background singing 'I'm super satisfied, super satisfied.' Apparently, Wang wasn't 'super satisfied.' She filed a class action lawsuit in Brooklyn Monday against the Canadian based company Gildan Outerwear. Passion: In the sexually suggestive commercial for the pantyhose, a woman is seen walking down the street, seemingly in the throes of passion . Kushyfoot: At the end of the commercial, the woman is surrounded by a group of women eager to know her secret and the woman pulls a package of the stockings from her purse and says 'Kushyfoot' Wang's lawyer, C.K.Lee, told the Post that the advertisement indicated that Wang would get 'a massage through her pantyhose.' But the product turned out to be 'just socks,' he said. Wang purchased the shaping tights and wore them for a week, the suit claims, but experienced no pleasurable sensations. The product's description on the Kushyfoot website claims the shaping tights include a 'massaging sole for extra comfort' and a 'firm shaper that tames your tummy, hips and thighs.' Misleading: The suit claims that the tights manufacturer used unreliable and misleading language to describe the product and that Wang relied on the 'tension relief and massage claims' According to the class action suit, Wang is seeking 'redress for deceptive and otherwise improper business practices.' The suit claims that the tights manufacturer used unreliable and misleading language to describe the product and that Wang relied on the 'tension relief and massage claims.'

"Kugannesan Balasubramaniam has been jailed for nine months for shunting a classic car so hard it killed the driver, pictured at Southwark Crown Court . A short-sighted taxi driver has been jailed for just nine months for shunting a classic car so hard it 'folded like a penknife' – killing the driver. Kugannesan Balasubramaniam, 34, has been convicted of causing death by careless driving after ramming his Peugeot people carrier into the back of the 1963 MGB convertible roadster at 48mph. 'Inspirational' teacher Nick Sennett, 58, who had hired the classic car for a few days, suffered serious head injuries when his car was shunted forward violently near Paddington in London. He was knocked unconscious and paramedics spent an hour trying to save him after the incident in April 2013, but the economics teacher was pronounced dead at the scene. The court heard how the minicab driver was overtired after working 90 hours in the previous seven days for the cab hire company One to One and was speeding. He had just collected a sixth-form student from Heathrow Airport and was taking her to an address in northwest London when the collision occurred. 'He was over-tired when he was driving and over-tired in circumstances where he had gone into that situation for commercial gain,' said prosecutor Nick Bleaney. The short-sighted driver also failed a basic numberplate-reading eye test when officers attended the scene, Southwark Crown Court heard. Balasubramaniam told officers at the scene that the vintage car pulled suddenly in front of him. But a tracking device inside the vehicle recorded the minicab driver was doing 48mph on the 40mph road and he was convicted by the jury. Shortly before the collision another driver saw Balasubramaniam making a mobile phone call as the traffic built up. 'She noticed this defendant was starting to get frustrated and slapping the steering wheel with his hands,' Mr Bleaney said. 'She then noticed the line of traffic in front of their car and it wasn't clear to her whether it was completely stationary or moving slowly. Nick Sennett, who previously taught chef Heston Blumenthal, was killed when Balasubramaniam ploughed his Peugeot van into the back of his classic car at 48mph on the A40 Westway . Mr Sennett had hired the 1963 MGB convertible roadster, similar to this one, for a few days and the court heard how it 'folded like a penknife' in the crash . 'But she noticed around that point that the defendant started to speed up to a speed that would be appropriate to an empty road.' The force of the impact also shunted cars ahead of the MGB in the four-car crash, jurors heard. 'Essentially the MGB folded like a penknife,' said Mr Bleaney. Mr Sennett, a teacher at £15,700-a-year Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith, counted chef Heston Blumenthal as one of his former pupils. In a letter to parents, headmaster David Goodhew said: 'It is clear he touched the lives of so many and is remembered with tremendous warmth and affection. The school has lost a great teacher, a dear tutor and a good friend.' Mr Blumenthal said: 'What made Nick stand out was his very calm, playful banter. 'He was one of those teachers you could be very comfortable around. He was really lovable, really funny, chilled out.' Motoring organisations are warning classic car owners about the dangers of driving older models. Older vehicles do not have crumple zones and even recent classics like Minis and Ford Capris will come off a lot worse in a collision with the latest models. Ian Crowder from the AA said: 'These cars simply do not have the damage resistance of modern vehicles. 'Classic car owners and users really need to be aware of the risks when they take the road in a less resilient vehicle. 'This was obviously a terribly tragic episode for which a driver has been convicted and jailed.' Mr Crowder said most other road users often drive more respectfully when they are near to classic cars. But the owners and users of older cars need to take extra care when they take to the road. 'They need to drive in a manner which respects modern vehicles and they need to know the risks,' Mr Crowder said. Balasubramaniam from Wembley was cleared of causing death by dangerous driving but convicted of the lesser alternative charge of causing death by careless driving. He was sentenced to nine months immediate custody, disqualified from driving for 18 months and must take an extended driving test when he is released. Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC told him: 'The harm you have caused cannot be overstated and no sentence passed upon you can ever reflect the catastrophic and devastating loss to Mr Sennett's family. 'The deceased was a devoted, loving and loved husband, father at the centre of what might be described as an idylilic long-term family life. 'He had a great range of friends and colleagues, wide-ranging interests and was adored by those who were in some way a part of his life,' he said. 'You were driving a Peugeot minicab, had collected a fare from Heathrow and were on your way to Kings Cross. 'Traffic was heavy and was stopping and starting, it was a fine clear day. 'In that outside lane you entered an area of clear road at this point you were speeding at 48mph in a 40mph zone. 'The vehicles in front of you in same lane but further down the road had stopped an were stationary but you failed to notice those stationary vehicles in front of you, indeed your passenger describes you as accelerating in that area of clear road. 'The consequence was you drove into the back of Mr Sennett's stationary 1963 MGB car. 'If you braked, in my judgement it was only in the last split-second. 'You hit the deceased's vehicle, causing him catastrophic head injuries - the speed of the impact is illustrated by the massive damage to that classic car. 'Despite the valiant and prolonged efforts of members of the public trying to save Mr Sennett's life, he was in fact pronounced dead at the scene.'

"A 13-year-old girl and her 18-year-old boyfriend are wanted by police for a crime spree across Kentucky after running away when they were confronted about their under-age relationship. After fleeing from Grayson County on January 4, Cheyenne Phillips and Dalton Hayes trashed a cattle farm and stole two trucks, inflicting thousands of dollars of damage on one, authorities said. They were last caught on surveillance camera on Monday at a Walmart in Manning, South Carolina but remain on the loose, the Grayson County Sheriff's Office said. Outside the store, the duo were seen driving a stolen red 2006 Toyota Tacoma, which had a firearm inside when it was taken, police said. On the run: Cheyenne Phillips, 13, and her boyfriend Dalton Hayes, 18, have been missing from their Kentucky homes for 10 days and are accused of stealing two trucks as they elude police officers . The teens were last seen at home earlier this month. Cheyenne's father called police to report his daughter, a seventh-grader at Grayson County Middle School, missing when she failed to come home on the night of January 3. It emerged she was at Hayes' home,WHAS reported. On January 4, police contacted Hayes' mother, Tammy Martin. Martin said her son had been dating Cheyenne for about three months - and that the young girl led her to believe she was 19, not 13. 'I texted Cheyenne and said the police are looking for you, she says why, I said they say you're under aged,' she recalled. When Martin returned home, the pair were gone. After the pair had been on the run for a week, police started seeking them for a different reason. On Sunday evening, Jim and his wife Kathy McGrew returned to their home in Grayson County from church to find the pair stealing their truck, WHAS reported. Caught on camera: The teenagers were filmed at a Walmart in Manning, South Carolina on Monday . Escape: The couple are believed to have stolen this 2006 Toyota Tacoma which had a firearm inside . The teenagers raced down the road with police in pursuit, before tearing across a cattle farm and driving into the woods. Mr McGrew searched for them in his plane while police used a K-9 unit, but all they found was the abandoned, wrecked truck with $7,500 worth of damage and a trail of clothes left behind. But later that day, they stole the red Toyota Tacoma, the sheriff said. Tammy Martin said she's worried about what her son might do. 'He's never went this long without contacting me, and it's really very stressful,' she said. 'I'm just worried that they're not safe anymore.' Hayes is wanted for custodial interference and other offenses. Both are suspected in at least two felony thefts and other crimes, Grayson County Sheriff Norman Chaffins said. Rebels: Hayes' mother said she had been led to believe that 13-year-old Cheyenne was 19 . Missing: Police were notified of the relationship when Cheyenne's father reported her missing when she stayed the night at Hayes' home. After they learned they were sought over the age difference, they fled . He called for the two to be arrested or turned themselves in 'as their behavior is becoming increasingly brazen and dangerous'. 'We just want them to come in, turn themselves in because eventually it's just going get worse for them, and law enforcement, and we do not want that to happen,' Chaffins told WLKY. Cheyenne was wearing a black, long-sleeve shirt and black sweatpants with brown and pink cowboy boots when she was caught on camera in South Carolina. Hayes was wearing blue jeans, a University of Kentucky Wildcats t-shirt and black tennis shoes.

"A mother and her new husband have been charged with the murder of her toddler daughter -  just two days after the couple decided to get married. Summer Everett, 22, and her husband Christopher Knapp, 24, were arrested on Wednesday and were being held at Mobile County Jail in Alabama. They were also charged with aggravated child abuse. DaKota Burke, who was 20 months old, died on January 8 at USA Medical Center after she was brought in suffering burns and vicious bruising a week previously.

Summer Everett, 22, and her husband of two days Christopher Knapp, 24, were charged with her daughter's murder on Wednesday in Alabama . The toddler had been rushed to hospital on December 31 after the mother found her daughter unconscious at their home. Sheriff deputies were called by medics to the hospital. A statement was later released which read: 'The child's hands, feet and face were burned. There was noticeable trauma to the face and head of the child.' The child's cause of death has not been released nor further details of the abuse. Everett and Knapp, who is not the child's father, married on January 12 - four days after the baby girl died. Mobile County Sheriff Sam Cochran told al.com: 'It's pretty odd. I have never seen it before... to get married even before they buried the child.' The sheriff also said that his staff had been deeply affected by the tragic abuse that the little girl had suffered. He added: 'They have never seen such harm inflicted on a child.

Standing awkwardly on a Manhattan street on December 17, the 69-year-old newsman can be seen looking at his lover, 41-year-old Lisan Goines, who is grinning back at him - just blocks from the Upper West Side home he shares with his wife, Jennet Conant, author of 'A Covert Affair'. The pair, who are both married, met for drinks at the five-star Essex Hotel and were later seen kissing in the back of a cab, according to the National Enquirer. Kroft has admitted to the affair, calling it 'a serious lapse in personal judgment' after the magazine revealed that the duo had carried on a three-year relationship and published their raunchy texts. Scroll down for video . Together: Steve Kroft is pictured with his attorney lover Lisan Goines in New York City on December 17. The CBS news correspondent has admitted to the affair, calling it a 'serious lapse of personal judgment' 'My wife and I are committed to each other and are working hard to get past this,' he told the New York Post. The 60 Minutes correspondent, who is married with one son, and Goines hooked up in hotels across Manhattan and Washington, D.C. after meeting at a bar in 2011, it reported. Kroft had spotted Goines - who was then engaged to be married - from across the room in the St Regis and went to talk to her and her friend. While her friend was using the restroom, 'Steve quickly told Lisan, ""I have to see you again"",' a source said. A few weeks later, they arranged to meet for cocktails and afterwards, he handed her a room key so he could be alone with her, convincing her he was in a sexless marriage, the Enquirer reported. Throughout their affair, Kroft and Goines exchanged a series of racy text messages, including one in which he told her he 'would rather be eating your pudding' than be at work. 'Don't work too hard this week bc I wanna wear you out afterward,' Goines reportedly replied. 'Mistress': 41-year-old Goines, who is also married, met 69-year-old Kroft in a hotel bar in 2011 . Together: Kroft, pictured with his wife in May 2014, said they were working hard to get past the affair . In another message, he told her: 'Miss you and all that goes with it. Especially my favorite tastes and colors... pink and brown,' according to the publication. He also asked her what her 'preference' would be, and she reportedly responded:  'U all over and deep inside of me,' she reportedly responded. Sources also revealed the couple's bedroom habits, including his use of Viagra and how he poured champagne in her behind before drinking it. But while their affair began at the $700-a-night Four Seasons hotel, it quickly lost its luxurious edge and went 'kind of low end', a source said. She would often meet him while he was working in Washington D.C. and once asked him to buy her a ticket, and he agreed but only footed the bill that once, the report added. 'The whole thing soured because she got to the point where it was only about Steve,' a source said. They added that Goines never had any intention of leaving her husband and did not want Kroft to leave his wife, so ended it - until they were spotted out in Manhattan together on December 17. Questions: Kroft, pictured left in 1992 with Al Gore (center) and Bill Clinton (right) famously confronted Clinton about his womanizing during an interview during his election campaign in 1992 . The reports come more than two decades after Kroft confronted Bill Clinton over his womanizing when he was Arkansas governor. He has been married to Conant, 55, for 23 years. She is a journalist and author of four books about World War II, including three New York Times bestsellers, including 'A Covert Affair: Julia Child and Paul Child in the OSS'. The couple lives in New York and they have one son, John. Kroft joined CBS in 1980 and has been with 60 Minutes for 26 years. His reporting has earned him three Peabody Awards and nine Emmy awards, including a lifetime achievement award. He told the New York Post that his 'personal failure' has no impact on his job as a journalist.

"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said being bored was an important skill for children to learn . Children must learn to be bored and entertain themselves, says Education Secretary Nicky Morgan in a warning to parents not to plan activities around the clock. The mother-of-one said parents have to 'grapple' with limiting the amount of time children have with tablets and games consoles, insisting turning off gadgets forces them to play with traditional toys like Lego and cars. And she warned parents not to do homework themselves, stressing it does not help their children and good teachers will be catch them out. Mrs Morgan married husband Jonathan in 2000 and they have a seven-year-old son, Alex. She balances her job in charge of schools across England with family life. Many parents trying to plan extra-curricular activities to keep children occupied for every waking moment, but Mrs Morgan said is important to let children be bored. She told House magazine: 'I do think that, speaking as a mum, when my son says ""I’m bored"", I say ""Well, just go away and find something to do, you’ve got lots of toys, lots of things there"". 'And then suddenly I will find that my son is busy, has dragged something out, he’s amusing himself, and I think that there is an element of not needing every moment in the day to be filled. 'I think it’s an important skill to be learned. If we say to him ""just go and do something"", it’s amazing how much the Lego will come out, or Playmobil, whatever it might be, and actually it’s lovely then to see him, he’s busy building things, Hot Wheels tracks.' However, while her parents' generation just had to coax youngsters away from watching television, today children have many more hi-tech distractions. On one occasion Alex woke early one morning wanting to play on his tablet. 'Alex woke us up at half past five. And as a result he lost gadget time for the rest of the day. 'He was deeply unimpressed by that. We had a little negotiation about whether ""gadget time"" meant ""TV and screen time"".' She went on: 'Because of the growth of tablets and everything else and the fact that children are using them younger - which is many ways a good thing, they are great learning tools – I think it’s all kinds of new challenges. 'I guess our parents had ‘TV time’, we had the same kind of issue, but I do think it’s one of those things to grapple with.' Mr Morgan said parents have to 'grapple' with limiting the amount of time children have with tablets and games console . Last year a study suggested that almost a quarter of parents complete homework with no input from their child. But Mrs Morgan said it was counter-productive and does little to help their children in the long run. 'I think it’s about parental supervision and support and engagement. You know it’s not them. I would trust teachers to make sure they were asking for projects that work, that children are going to be doing. 'They will make it clear to parents that you’re not helping necessarily if you’re doing an awful lot of it.' Despite being in charge of the nation's teachers, she confessed to being uneasy about talking to them. 'I do think as a parent sometimes you want to know what’s going on in the classroom but don’t necessarily know how to ask. I still get nervous talking to teachers and it reminds you of being at school yourself. And seeing what your child is doing is really, really important.' Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said she would like to send her son to a secondary state school when he is older . Mrs Morgan said she would 'very much like' to send her son to a state secondary school when he is older. The Loughborough MP, who was educated at the private Surbiton High School, indicated that she would follow her predecessor Michael Gove and Prime Minister David Cameron in sending her child to a state secondary. In the wide-ranging interview,  she also stressed the importance of teaching British values of tolerance and free speech to youngsters in the wake of the terror atrocities in Paris. The Tory minister said the attacks by Islamic extremists in the French capital were an example of what happens 'when people don't appear to respect some of those values'. She said the attacks on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket in the French capital had shown the need to teach youngsters about the importance of ""core values"". 'One of the other things we are asking of schools is the whole teaching of British values. This applies to all schools, it's about these core values. 'We've seen what can happen last week when people don't appear to respect some of those values, things like tolerance and mutual respect. In the light of recent events ... It's very, very important. 'I know this is being discussed in governing boards up and down the country. Many schools do this without necessarily badging it as such. And others are having to think 'how do we bring this in?' She said citizenship and social education classes were ""very important' and added 'we must have core common values, that builds us as a country'. Mrs Morgan said: ""These British values have been defined in various strategies, by the Home Office, and we are asking schools to think about how they promote them. Ofsted will be looking at them when they visit schools. 'It's about that shared history or heritage which I think makes us really strong as a country. We have freedom of speech and liberty in this country, we may not have had a revolution in the same way they perhaps had in France but I do think there are things that are precious and if we don't guard them and if we don't appreciate them ... Sometimes we think it's not very British to talk about them - but I think it's now clear that we do need to talk about them.'","Nicky Morgan says parents must 'grapple' with limiting gadget time .

"Rui Li was found murdered in the boot of a Fiat Punto in Bournemouth, Dorset. Her bigamist husband, his other wife, and son are on trial accused of her murder . A bigamist conspired with his wife and son to kill his second bride for her £300,000 life insurance policy, a court heard. French national Pierre Legris, 61, also known as Alain Baron, is accused of killing Rui Li by hitting her over the head with a blunt implement before wrapping her body in a building sheet at the home they shared in Bournemouth, Dorset, on May 23 last year. The 44-year-old Chinese national, who moved to the UK in 2003, was found in the boot of a Fiat Punto car a week later on May 30. Nigel Lickley QC, prosecuting, told Winchester Crown Court that Pierre Legris conspired to murder Ms Li, who worked as a nurse, with his other wife, Irene Smith, 66, and their son Jonathan Legris, 27. He explained that the three defendants had financial difficulties and this was a potential motive for the killing. He said that Ms Li, who drove a Porsche Boxster, had a life insurance policy worth £300,000 and also owned a property which she was trying to sell to make a profit of £100,000. Mr Lickley said it was at this property in Wolverton Road, Bournemouth, where Pierre Legis ran a massage service which also 'on occasion' provide 'sexual services.' The court heard that some customers, who responded to an advert on Gumtree, paid for the sexual services of Rui Li and that Pierre Legris was present and participated. Mr Lickley said that the defence put forward by Pierre Legris was that a 'disgruntled' customer may have followed Ms Li home and murdered her while her husband was out. The prosecutor said that Ms Li was murdered at her home which was undergoing substantial building work. Mr Lickley said: 'Rui Li suffered blunt force trauma, an injury to the back of her head. The blows were so forceful they were probably caused by a heavy implement, one of those blows caused a deep penetrating wound to the back of Rui Li's head. 'Such was the nature of the wound that she would have been expected to have bled extensively. 'No such heavy weapon has been found and in addition very little blood was found at the scene - it suggests a thorough clean-up has been done to prevent blood from escaping to the scene nearby.' French national Pierre Legris, 61, pictured left, denies the murder of his second wife Rui Li. His son, Jonathan Legris, 27, pictured right, denies conspiracy to murder and assisting an offender . Mr Lickley said that Pierre Legris had bought several bags of cement and added: 'It may be there was a plan to bury Rui Li under the floor of that property.' Mr Lickley said that the victim's body was in fact placed in Pierre Legris' Ford Transit van which the following day was worked on by Jonathan Legris at the garage which was owned by his mother, Smith, and which he ran with his father. He explained that Jonathan Legris replaced the starter motor while Ms Li's body lay in the back of the van at Cromer Motors in St Clement's Road, Bournemouth. Mr Lickley added that the body was later transferred to a Fiat Punto, owned by Jonathan Legris and on sale at the garage, which he drove to Verwood Crescent, Bournemouth, where Ms Li was found a week after she was killed. He said that following the killing Pierre Legris was 'cool and focused and clear in what he was doing, not rushed or in a panic, he had a plan and it involved others, his son, Jonathan Legris and his other wife Irene Smith'. He added: 'The fact is the three of them were involved in a conspiracy to kill.' Jonathan Legris was alleged to have driven the Fiat Punto with Ms Li's body inside . Mr Lickley said that the day after the killing, Pierre Legris and Smith went to a dance competition in Watford and it was the following Tuesday that he reported Ms Li missing to the police after Poole Hospital where she worked had begun inquiries to her whereabouts. Her daughter of a previous marriage, Lu Yao, 18, had also begun asking questions about her mother. During police interview, Pierre Legris was to change his story from not knowing anything about her death to saying he had gone out and returned to find her murdered. Mr Lickley said: 'He said he left for 40 minutes then came back to find Rui Li murdered. He told police in panic he cleaned the scene, wrapped her body as she was found, he put her into the Transit van and carried on as normal.' Describing the financial motive for the killing, Mr Lickley said that Pierre Legris' financial affairs 'were becoming desperate' and explained the 'complicated link' between his finances and his two wives. He said that Smith was in danger of losing her home because she owed money on the property and was unable to get a mortgage because of her age. Pierre Legris was intending to buy the property from her and she had transferred £50,000 to his account to use as a deposit but the bank was asking questions about these funds. Mr Lickley said that this was further complicated by the fact that Pierre Legris was due to pay £20,000 back to relatives of Ms Li in China which would have come from the deposit money which in fact belonged to Smith. Mr Lickley said that 'animosity' between the two wives meant that 'the last thing that would have been countenance would be Rui Li helping herself to what would have been Irene Smith's money.' Prior to the start of the trial, Legris pleaded guilty to an offence of bigamy by marrying Ms Li in 2007 while having been married to Smith since 1987. He denies murder. Jonathan Legris and Smith deny a charge of conspiracy to murder. Jonathan Legris, of Spring Road, Bournemouth, also denies a charge of assisting an offender by driving the Fiat Punto with Ms Li's body inside. Smith, of St Clement's Road, also denies a charge of perverting the course of justice by providing a false alibi to Pierre Legris by saying he stayed at her home on the night of the murder. She also denies an offence of assisting an offender by hiring a storage facility and placing her husband's clothes and French passport in it. The trial was adjourned until tomorrow. The trial of Pierre Legris, Jonathan Legris and Irene Smith is taking place at Winchester Crown Court .

"Authorities are cracking down on Islamic fundamentalist preacher Junaid Thorne after they ordered him to face charges in court following allegations he has travelled between Sydney and Perth using false names. The controversial self-styled sheik was on Thursday issued with a notice to appear in a Perth court at a later date, an AFP spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. AFP officers conducted a search warrant on a home in Bass Hill, south-west of Sydney, on Thursday and the 25-year-old was subsequently informed of the notice. He will face charges in court for using a carriage service to book a ticket under a false name and the second for using the ticket to travel interstate, the West Australian reports. Scroll down for video . Authorities are cracking down on Islamic fundamentalist preacher Junaid Thorne after they ordered him to face charges in court following a suspected terror-related raid in Sydney on Thursday . While police only released few details of the raid in Sydney, Thorne could reportedly face further charges. Daily Mail Australia understands Thorne has recently moved from Perth to Sydney. It comes days after he sparked outrage when he told social media followers that insults to the Prophet Mohammad were 'not allowed' and were likely to 'simulate some kind of response' following the terror attacks on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris. His comments came just hours after 12 people were killed in the Paris massacre. Thorne said staff at Charlie Hebdo had 'forbade to learn the lesson' of a firebombing in 2011, which took place a day after a caricature of the Prophet was published. 'Insulting someone's Prophet is very likely to stimulate some kind of response. It is not allowed under any context/religion,' Thorne tweeted last week. 'If you want to enjoy 'freedom of speech' with no limits, expect others to exercise ""freedom of action"".' The controversial self-styled sheik was on Thursday issued with a notice to appear in a Perth court at a later date, an AFP spokesperson confirmed . He sparked outrage last week when he told social media followers that insults to the Prophet Mohammad were 'not allowed' following the terror attacks on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris . Thorne, who spent 14-years growing up in Saudi Arabia, refused to answer questions about his statement when contacted by Daily Mail Australia. Outspoken politician Jacqui Lambie called for him to be jailed for treason following his controversial comments. In a statement, Ms Lambie blamed previous governments for failing to protect Australian citizens against these type of extremists living amongst us. 'There are now Australian citizens (like the mongrel in WA) who brazenly, express public sympathy and support for the actions of the Islamic extremists,' Ms Lambie said. 'When you provoke an enormous number of people, or degrade the followers of a religion by insulting something or someone they hold sacred, don't expect to be left alone,' he said. Ms Lambie called for Thorne and other extremists living in Australia to be tried for treason before they 'seek to impose their culture on us - or kill us'. Thorne, pictured right, made an appearance at a court case for terror suspect Sulayman Khalid last year . Junaid Thorne does not describe himself as an Islamic State supporter. He told the ABC last year: 'I may support them (on) certain issues, while I disagree with them in other issues.' His remarks came as pictures emerged of the preacher last year accompanying Sulayman Khalid, 20, to a court appearance. Khalid, from western Sydney, was charged with terrorism related offences last month over an alleged plot to commit guerilla warfare in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney. The court appearance concerned allegations Khalid intimidated an Iraqi cleaner at a western Sydney shopping centre. Khalid rose to infamy after wearing an Islamic State symbol onto the set of an SBS television program about the Islamic State last year. Thorne would not answer questions about how he knew Khalid, only joking: 'We used to go out in (Kings) Cross together... Since we started going to church'. The firebrand Perth preacher Thorne (left) has called Australian authorities 'the real terrorists' in the past . Thorne does not describe himself as a supporter of the Islamic State . Over the past 12 months, Thorne's views have been the subject of public scrutiny. Following the nation's biggest ever terror raids last September, he labelled Australian authorities 'the real terrorists' in a statement posted on his Facebook page. After Melbourne man Numan Haider, 18, allegedly stabbed two police officers outside of a police station, Thorne said that he had been 'murdered by authorities'. Thorne later told the ABC Haider had attended some of his lectures, which he performs around the country. Thorne does not describe himself as a supporter of the Islamic State. He told the ABC last year: 'If I were to vocalise my complete support to them (Islamic State), I would get in trouble,' he said. 'If I was to say that (I) don't support them at all, that would be untrue. 'I may support them on certain issues, while I disagree with them on other issues'.

"A 27 stone woman who was too scared to have a bath for  20 years has spoken of her joy at getting her life back - after losing more than half her body weight. Linda Pearson, 62, feared her huge size 38 frame would get trapped in the tub. But the mother-of-two shed a 16 stone and 13 dress sizes and is now a slim size 12. She now regularly enjoys 10 mile hikes – something that would have been unheard of before - and is no longer afraid to have a bath. Linda Pearson shed 16 stone and 13 sizes after she became utterly ashamed and depressed about her weight . Mrs Pearson climbing Mount Snowdon after her weight loss. Before, she had to lean on a trolley to do her shopping because she was so breathless . She said: 'Before I lost the weight, I had had to lean on a trolley to do my shopping because I got so out of breath. 'Or, I'd make sure I brought everything I needed downstairs at the start of the day so I didn't have to go up again, because I knew I wouldn't have the puff. ‘Now I’ve climbed Mount Snowdon.’ Mrs Pearson, from Leeds, said the battle with her weight began after the births of her daughters, Melanie, now 38, and Lisa, 40. She said: 'I've always been on the big side, but not so much that I would worry about it. 'But after the girls were born, the weight just piled on. 'My problem was portion control and my love of chocolate. I could eat five bars at once when I had a craving. 'I tried diet after diet, but while the weight would come off in the short term, afterwards I’d treat myself and put back on what I had lost plus more.' By the time her daughters were adults, Mrs Pearson weighed 27 stone and wore a size 38, which she had buy from specialists online. 'My husband Jerry has always been slim and by that point one of him could have fitted in one leg of my trousers,' she recalled. The turning point came when the couple went on holiday to Cyprus in 2010. Mrs Pearson said: 'Jerry really wanted to go abroad and we hadn't been for several years so I felt it wouldn't be fair to say no. 'But I really didn't want to go. I knew it would be hot and that wasn't good for someone of my size. ‘It was bad enough during summer in the UK. Just walking down the street I’d be dripping in sweat.’ Mrs Pearson, pictured before and after, said the battle with her weight began after the births of her daughters. She also ate huge portions and constantly gave into chocolate cravings, at times eating five bars in a row . The plane journey alone left her with bruised knees from being squeezed so tightly against the passenger seat in front. Once at their apartment, both the heat and shame left Mrs Pearson a prisoner in her room. She said: 'I never left the apartment during the day for the whole two weeks we were there. 'I only went out to eat when it was dark. I didn’t want people to see me and stare. ‘I felt so down and guilty because my husband was off sightseeing on his own. I vowed then that I would never go on holiday again as a super morbidly obese person. ‘There were no photos of either of us from the whole holiday which is really sad. Jerry would come back in the evening and say what he’d been up to on his own. ‘It was utterly miserable and I knew I had to do something about it.' Having seen a TV programme on weight loss surgery, on her return Mrs Pearson called her GP about it. ‘I was so ashamed and felt so guilty my husband had spent our holiday on his own, I phoned a week after we got back. 'I thought if I didn’t do something, my life would be very short. I felt that surgery was the only long term option so that I could enjoy my life with my daughters and grandchildren.' During an appointment at a private clinic, the consultant suggested she think about a gastric bypass, given her history of failed diets and problems with portion control. But it certainly wasn't an easy option she took lightly. 'I knew there was a chance I might not come around from the anaesthetic - even though things are much more sophisticated for larger people now,' Mrs Pearson said. Ashamed at her weight and fearing she would die early, Mrs Pearson sought help for her weight. After losing three stone naturally, she underwent a gastric bypass - and has since lost 16 stone overall . She credits her success with an online weight loss forum, which gives dieters advice. She said: I live a life I only ever dreamed of and have so much to look forward to' 'But I was determined to go ahead. I even lost three stone before the operation to be safer in surgery and prove how committed I was to making a change. 'Even though I lost that, I didn’t dream of cancelling the surgery, I knew I couldn’t do it all naturally.’ After being discharged home, Mrs Pearson used the charity website, Weight Loss Surgery Info, as well as forums, for advice and encouragement. ‘I could only eat liquids for weeks, it’s like weaning a baby,’ she explained. ‘By week eight, I was on solids but could only have soft food, like stews or salmon. It was so tough but great not feeling I was doing it on my own. 'If I had any problem I knew there would be someone out there who had gone, or was going, through the same thing.' After a year, Mrs Pearson had lost 10 stone. Another year on, she has now lost another two and is a size 12-14 - a drop of 13 dress sizes. Feeling fit, the grandmother climbed to the summit of Mount Snowdon, raising £500 for the weight loss charity which supported her through her journey. 'The bypass has changed my life and the charity helped me an awful lot,’ she said. ‘By raising funds for them, I hope I can help them help others like the old me. ‘Looking at photos of me back then, it’s hard to believe I’ve climbed a mountain and go on nine or 10 mile walks every weekend. ‘I live a life I only ever dreamed of and have so much to look forward to. ‘Jerry and the girls are really proud. ‘One of the best things of all is being able to have a lovely soak in the bath at the end of the day. 'For 20 years I was worried I'd get trapped so I steered clear. Not anymore. I love life.’","Linda Pearson, 62, feared her size 38 frame would get trapped in the tub .

The 32-year-old Bensalaman Ismai was attacked at around 6am on January 26 last year after becoming embroiled in a dispute over a taxi in Birmingham city centre. After trying to run away, he was chased down and punched, kicked and hit in the face with the buckle of his belt, causing him to lose vision in one of his eyes. Scroll down for video . Savage: Simeon Evans and Jack Gargham were filmed whipping Mr Ismai with his belt, hitting him in the face with its buckle and leaving him blind in one eye . At the end of the video Sophie Sheldon, 20, is seen punching him in the face while wearing a little black dress. She was given a suspended sentence of two years . Algerian Bensalaman Ismai (pictured left and right) permanently lost sight in his left eye following the attack . The men have been jailed for the attack which took place last January during a late-night fight over taxis . Simeon Evans, 30, and Jack Gargham, 26, were jailed for four years for the 'savage' attack, while Sophie Sheldon, 20, who is seen punching him in the face, was given a suspended sentence of two years. The violence came after their victim became involved in an argument with Evans over a taxi. He is seen running away but is chased down by Evans who snatches the belt out of his hand and begins whipping his face and body. Gargham then joined in the attack, kicking Mr Ismai while he writhes on the ground to the horror of by-standers. Sheldon is later seen running towards the group, punching him several times in the face. Sophie Sheldon (pictured in a black dress, above) was also jailed after being filmed punching him in the face while he writhed on the ground . Simeon Evans (left) and Jack Gargham (right) were both convicted of grievous bodily harm and jailed . Mr Ismai has had two operations since the attack, but has permanently lost sight in his left eye as a result of the brutality. 'The amount of mindless violence that was inflicted was totally over the top and was definitely fuelled by alcohol,' said  Detective Constable Chris Smith of West Midlands Police. 'The victim has had to go through an extensive amount of medical treatment including surgery. 'After an initial operation on his eye he needed further surgery and in March was told that he had lost the sight in his left eye permanently. 'He is still coming to terms with his injuries and has told me that he feels his live is over, and there’s no opportunity left to him. 'We accept yesterday’s decision and hope that the jail sentence brings some comfort to the victim.' Sophie Sheldon posted this photograph on social media after being released from court without a custodial sentence (left). The 20-year-old was given a two year suspended sentence and a six-month curfew . After being handed her sentence, the 20-year-old posted this photograph of her posing outside court .","Two men and a women were jailed over 'savage' attack on 32-year-old man .

"Elon Musk may be a driving force behind super-intelligent computers, but he's also one of the most outspoken people on its dangers. He has previously described it as 'summoning the demon' and a threat that is 'more dangerous than nukes.' Now the SpaceX-founder says he is donating $10 million (£6.6 million) to the Future of Life Institute for research on how to keep artificial intelligence safe. Scroll down for video . Elon Musk says he is donating $10 million (£6.6 million) to the Future of Life Institute for research on how to keep artificial intelligence safe. He has previously said: 'I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it's probably that' In a tweet announcing his investment, the 43-year-old, said it is 'all fun and games' until something goes awry. Earlier this week, Musk joined Stephen Hawking and other prominent scientists in signing an open letter to ensure AI research benefits humanity. The letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines, mankind could be heading for a dark future. The document, drafted by the Future of Life Institute, said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind. In a tweet announcing his investment, the 43-year-old, said it is 'all fun and games' until something goes awry . The authors say there is a 'broad consensus' that AI research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society. It highlights speech recognition, image analysis, driverless cars, translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research. 'The potential benefits are huge, since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence; we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools AI may provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable,' the authors write. But it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of AI had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak. Earlier this week, a group of scientists and entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking (pictured), have signed an open letter promising to ensure AI research benefits humanity . For instance, in the short term, it claims AI may put millions of people out of work. In the long term, it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming. 'Our AI systems must do what we want them to do,' the letter says. 'Many economists and computer scientists agree that there is valuable research to be done on how to maximise the economic benefits of AI while mitigating adverse effects, which could include increased inequality and unemployment.' Other signatories to the FLI's letter include Luke Muehlhauser, executive director of Machine Intelligence Research Institute and Frank Wilczek, professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Nobel laureate. The letter comes just weeks after Professor Hawking warned that AI could someday overtake humans. Google has set up an ethics board to oversee its work in artificial intelligence. The . search giant has recently bought several robotics companies, along with . Deep Mind, a British firm creating software that tries to help . computers think like humans. One . of its founders warned artificial intelligence is 'number one risk for . this century,' and believes it could play a part in human extinction . 'Eventually, . I think human extinction will probably occur, and technology will . likely play a part in this,' DeepMind's Shane Legg said in a recent . interview. Among all forms . of technology that could wipe out the human species, he singled out . artificial intelligence, or AI, as the 'number 1 risk for this century.' The ethics board, revealed by web site The Information, is to ensure the projects are not abused. Neuroscientist . Demis Hassabis, 37, founded DeepMind two years ago . with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans. Speaking at event in London, the physicist told the BBC: 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.' This echoes claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating AI 'would be the biggest event in human history, [but] unfortunately, it might also be the last.' In November, Elon Musk, the entrepreneur behind Space-X and Tesla, warned that the risk of 'something seriously dangerous happening' as a result of machines with artificial intelligence, could be in as few as five years. Speaking at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) AeroAstro Centennial Symposium in October, Musk described artificial intelligence as our 'biggest existential threat'. He said: 'I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it's probably that. So we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence. 'I'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish. 'With artificial intelligence we're summoning the demon. You know those stories where there's the guy with the pentagram, and the holy water, and … he's sure he can control the demon? Doesn't work out.'

"Each year, tourists brave the harsh winds and freezing temperatures to witness the Northern Lights in all their glory. But for those who aren’t quite as adventurous, Google now lets so-called armchair explorers ‘visit’ the Aurora Borealis from their living room. The images were taken in the north of Finland and show lights created by oxygen molecules colliding approximately 60 miles (96km) above Earth.

Usually the charged particles from the sun are deflected by the Earth’s magnetic field, but some do manage to enter the atmosphere and collide with gas particles. These collisions emit light. As a result, Aurora is most common around the magnetic poles and is most often seen in areas with little light pollution, such as Finland where the Street View images were taken, and Iceland. Over the course of January and February last year, this geomagnetic storm and shock wave from a solar wind was so strong and significant, it travelled further south over the UK and could be seen in areas with little cloud cover. Auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are the most common. Shades of red, blue, and violet have also been reported. The common, greenish-yellow colour is caused by colliding oxygen molecules approximately 60 miles (96km) above Earth. Rare, red auroras are produced by oxygen molecules situated much higher up, at around 200 miles (321km). Nitrogen produces blue or purplish-red aurora. Laurian Clemence, from Google told MailOnline: ‘The Northern Lights is one of nature's most beautiful and mystical phenomena, only seen by very few in their lifetime.

"A former Olympic gymnast has revealed that she will continue her pregnancy with triplets, despite doctors advising her to abort two of her babies. Jaime Halsey and her rugby star husband Steve, both 35, were told they were expecting triplets in October, but were quickly referred to specialists who said the odds of them all surviving was 50/50. A 12-week scan showed one of the babies was 25 per cent smaller than the others and medics advised her to terminate two of them because they could cause serious risk to her health. Jaime Halsey, pictured with the expectant triplets new car seats, is 26 weeks pregnant and refused doctors advice to terminate two of her unborn babies . Jaime Halsey and her rugby star husband Steve, both 35, were told they were expecting triplets in October, but were quickly referred to specialists who said the odds of them all surviving was 50/50 . But the mother-to-be, who lives in Abington, Northampton, said she would not sacrifice the lives of two of her children just to save one. The couple, who have already have a two-year-old daughter, said they were determined to bring all three babies into the world to join their 'happy family'. The former trampolinist said: 'We had our first scan in Northampton at 12 weeks and were immediately referred to specialists at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. 'They told us one of the twins is 25 per cent smaller than the other and there's a massive risk of further growth restrictions. 'I also risk putting my body under three times the strain to keep them healthy, so they advised the termination. One of Mrs Halsey's ultrasound scans showing the three babies that she is expecting, which are all believed to be girls . The 12-week scan (pictured) showed one of the babies was 25 per cent smaller than the others and medics advised her to terminate two of them because they could cause serious risk to her health and the others . 'My initial emotional reaction was ""I can't do that, I will keep them all and carry on with the pregnancy whatever"". 'Steve was much more logical wanting to know what the risks were to me but collectively we made the decision we would give the three babies the best opportunity we possibly could to come into the world. 'Other people have triplets and I wasn't prepared to abort two healthy babies just to make life easier. 'As sport has taught us both, all you need is a chance, positivity and the faith of others in your ability to be a success.' Mrs Halsey, who was Team GB's first female trampolinist at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, married the former London Welsh rugby player in 2009. The couple  began trying for another baby in spring last year after daughter Flo began asking for a sister. But when she did fall pregnant scans revealed she had two monozygotic identical twins and one 'singleton' in her womb. Jamie and her rugby star husband Steve (left) already have one child - two-year-old daughter Flo (right) Jaime Halsey and her rugby star husband Steve, both 35, have refused to terminate two of their unborn babies despite doctors advice . Consultants told them twins sharing a placenta are at risk of twin-to-twin syndrome of Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR). Adding another baby into the equation has made her pregnancy particularly high-risk and even more rare and complicated. Mrs Halsey is now 26 weeks and has been told she will have to deliver the triplets, all believed to be girls, by caesarean. The new arrivals will then have to stay in incubators and be monitored carefully before they can be taken home. The 35-year-old, who began trampolining when she was 10 and is now a coach whilst running a cake-making business from home, added: 'I am as big now as I was at full-term with Flo. 'But the hardest thing is avoiding making plans for when they are born. We have checks almost weekly as things keep changing. 'If this was my first pregnancy I would be terrified, but seeing how ace Flo is makes me confident we can do this. Steve Halsey, a former London Welsh rugby player, and Jamie pictured on their wedding day in 2009 . 'Now the panic has gone, we can be excited about our big family and noisy house. 'I am determined to make this happen. I could not live with myself if I sacrificed two of them - to save one.' Mr Halsey - now a PE teacher - added: 'Reaching 24 weeks was a big milestone for Jaime. If they stay in there until 30 weeks then it gives me a much better chance of being born with less problems. 'Everything went well at the last scan and all three babies are growing well. The one twin remains smaller but all three are extremely active which is good news. 'We also had the chances to see the faces of our three little girls on a 3D scan which was really exciting. 'We never thought about terminating two of the babies for a second, we want to bring all three of them into our happy family.' Jaime was Team GB's first female trampolinist at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games and after some time out recovering from injuries, she earned the team their place in the Beijing Games in 2008 and was then a reserve .

"Pleaded guilty: Adrian Lubecki admitted playing a role in the supply of a class A drug known as PMMA . A teenage punk today pleaded guilty to supplying a dangerous batch of ‘Superman’ ecstasy pills linked to the deaths of four men. Adrian Lubecki, 19, appeared at court via video link and admitted playing a role in the supply of a class A drug known as PMMA. Police have seized more than 400 of the tablets but still do not know how many of the red, triangular pills are in circulation. The batch has been linked to the deaths of three men around Ipswich, Suffolk, and a fourth in Telford, Shropshire. Ipswich Crown Court heard Lubecki, who is Polish but lives in Ipswich, played a significant role in dealing drugs. Peter Gair, prosecuting, told the court there was evidence through text messages of Lubecki dealing the drugs. Lubecki admitted one charge of being concerned in the supply of a class A drug to another between December 21 and January 2. He also pleaded guilty to possessing the class B drug amphetamine with intent to supply on January 2. Police launched a hunt for the tablets following the deaths of Lithuanian-born Justas Ropas, 22, and Gediminas Kulokas, 24, in Ipswich. Mr Ropas died on Christmas Eve and his fellow countryman died on New Year’s Eve. 'Superman' drug: The batch has been linked to the deaths of three men around Ipswich and a fourth in Telford . On New Year’s Day, John Hocking, 20, was found dead in the village of Rendlesham, Suffolk, the same day as Daniel Bagnall, 27, 180 miles away in Telford. Lubecki was remanded in custody to appear for sentencing at the same court during the week starting on February 16. A second man, Damian Malolepszy, 28, of Telford, is charged with being concerned in the supply of ecstasy and possession with intent to supply a controlled drug. Malolepszy is remanded in custody and his case will be heard at Shrewsbury Crown Court on March 9. He is yet to enter a plea.","Adrian Lubecki, 19, admitted playing role in supply of class A drug .

"MPs today launched a bid for ‘Black Friday’ discounts to be scrapped to stop further ‘scenes of disorder’ as desperate shoppers fight each other for the best bargains. A Commons motion has been laid slamming retailers for offering ‘huge discounts’ on the last Friday of November – kick-starting the Christmas shopping season. The motion, signed by three MPs, claims the knock-down prices caused ‘scenes of disorder in some stores as many police had to attend to prevent or break up fights in stores, whilst other stores were forced to close’. Black Friday sales: Shoppers fought for bargains at ASDA in Wembley last year in scenes attacked by MPs today . ‘Many shoppers suffered injuries due to the level of public disorder caused by this event,’ it adds. The MPs call on ‘all UK retailers not to mark this event in 2015 or again’. It comes after shoppers an estimated £810million on Black Friday last year – November 28 – making it the biggest ever day for UK online sales. The shopping boom caused retailers to suffer their slowest December growth in six years after Black Friday spending disrupted the ‘timing and rhythm’ of Christmas sales. Liberal Democrat Greg Mulholland criticised large traders for adopting the American custom and sympathised with police officers who said they had ‘enough to do already’. Conservative former minister Sir Peter Bottomley joined with Mr Mulholland to urge UK retailers to ignore the event in 2015 and beyond. Police were called to stores around the country as the Black Friday sales descended into chaos.

"These incredible images show a thrill-seeking climber scaling some of the last remaining ice above the clouds on Africa’s highest mountain. Professional climber Will Gadd and his team hiked for a week to reach the remote precipice on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania and he may be one of the last to ever scale the crumbling ice wall. Some scientists are predicting that the ice will disappear completely by 2020 due to climate change. Scroll down for video . Professional climber Will Gadd and three other members of his team hiked for a week to reach the remote precipice on Mount Kilimanjaro . Mr Gadd may be one of the last to ever scale the receding ice wall as some experts believe the ice will completely disappear by 2020 . After completing the climb at an altitude of more than 19,500ft, Will Gadd said: ‘I've climbed a lot of ice, but this was the last of its kind' Mr Gadd said he felt lucky to complete the climb as the receding glaciers 'are just small remnants truly in their last grasp' After completing the climb at an altitude of more than 19,500ft, Will said: ‘I've climbed a lot of ice, but this was the last of its kind. ‘The glaciers are just small remnants truly in their last gasp. I felt very lucky to be there.’ The team – consisting of Will, climbing partner Sarah Hueniken, photographer Christian Pondella, and videographer Pablo Durana – had to cope with extreme challenges that put their bodies under incredible stress. Everyone on the team had to battle altitude sickness and sleepless nights. Will Gadd scaled the ice wall with climbing partner Sarah Hueniken, photographer Christian Pondella, and videographer Pablo Durana . The team had to cope with extreme challenges, including altitude sickness and sleepless nights, while scaling Africa's highest mountain . By climbing several overhanging and vertical glacier remnants, Will became one of the first people in the modern era to scale the receding ice . Will said: ‘You'd just fall asleep and then wake up gasping for breath. ‘We didn't have weeks and weeks to acclimate to the altitude, it's too expensive to stay on the mountain, so we definitely pushed ourselves physically. Fortunately it all worked out OK.’ By climbing several overhanging and vertical glacier remnants, each up to 200ft high, Will became one of the first people in the modern era – and possibly last – to scale the receding ice. Will Gadd said it was the 'wildest ice' he has encountered with ice fins sticking out of a desert of hot sand and overhanging prows . Will Gadd said the team pushed themselves physically because they didn't spend enough time acclimatising to the altitude . Will Gadd said the ice was 'literally disappearing in front of my eyes' as he scaled a frozen wall near the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro . Will added: ‘It was the wildest ice I've ever seen. ‘Ice fins sticking out of a desert of hot sand at 19,000 feet, overhanging prows that creaked while I climbed them, and so many wild possibilities blasted into crazy shapes by the high-altitude tropical sun. ‘The ice I climbed was literally disappearing in front of my eyes. None of what I climbed will survive another month. ‘Unfortunately, due to climate change, there won't be any ice on Kilimanjaro in the near future. ‘Kilimanjaro used to have ice over the entire summit plateau, but now there are only a few small glaciers remaining, and they are disappearing very fast.’","Professional climber Will Gadd and his team hiked for a week to reach the remote precipice on Mount Kilimanjaro .

"As the new year rolls in, taking stock of the one just past can prompt the age-old resolutions, 'eat healthier' and 'make better choices'. While taking steps towards these goals is often easier said than done, figuring out what foods will keep the weight off and your stomach full is now much easier thanks to Sheila Zhou, expert scientist at the USANA Health Sciences. 'Often when we graze between meals we make the mistake of opting for calorie laden foods, rather than making nutritious choices,' Ms Zhou told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . figuring out what foods will keep the weight off and your stomach full is now much easier . 'Not only does this hinder our body’s ability to properly process the food; it often also results in weight gain from the additional calorie consumption,' she said. 'Thankfully, there are alternatives that not only keep your energy levels up but also help you to shed those unwanted kilos.' After studying the diet of the average Australian, Ms Zhou noticed that people were choosing convenience over nutrition, resulting in a shocking deficiency in vitamins and minerals. 'If you look at the 2013-2014 survey done by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, you'll see that more than 90% of Australians don’t eat the recommended servings of fruit and vegatbales,' Ms Zhou said. 'People are opting for convenience, and often aren't aware that the types of food they are reaching for are high in sugar and saturated fats- things like processed and fast food,' she said. Ms Zhou decided to compile a list of alternatives to the unhealthy food many were consuming, under the principle that swapping, rather than removing, snacks was the ideal way to stay healthy. The Australian Heart Foundation advises that Australians should consume 1000mg of omega-3 each day, a figure which Ms Zhou said most people may not be aware of. 'If you are looking for a food that will keep you feeling full between meals and provide you with loads of nutrients, tuna is the perfect option,' Ms Zhou said . 1. Think fishy. Her first recommendation might come as a surprise, as Ms Zhou encourages eating fish as a snack. 'If you are looking for a food that will keep you feeling full between meals and provide you with loads of nutrients, tuna is the perfect option,' she said. 'Not only is it stacked with protein and omega-3 essential fatty acids, its ability to curb your craving leads to a flatter stomach.' The Australian Heart Foundation advises that Australians should consume 1000mg of omega-3 each day, a figure which Ms Zhou said most people may not be aware of. 'Properly frozen vegetables have similar nutrient levels as fresh vegetables, so in this case frozen foods can be a good option,' Ms Zhou said . 'The combination of low calorie density and high levels of fibre means they are both a filling and satisfying snack,' Ms Zhou said . 2. Play it cool. 'Frozen foods often get a bad rap when it comes to healthy eating, but snap frozen vegetables such as peas and corn are actually an excellent source of nutrients,' said Ms Zhou. While she recommends shopping each day for fresh food, Ms Zhou said that most people will do their shopping on the weekends and 'live out of the fridge during the week'. 'Properly frozen vegetables have similar nutrient levels as fresh vegetables, so in this case frozen foods can be a good option,' she said. 'The combination of low calorie density and high levels of fibre means they are both a filling and satisfying snack.' 3. Go nutty. 'Nuts are a great snack if you are conscious about your weight as they’re rich in a variety of vitamins and nutrients such as vitamin E, calcium, magnesium and potassium,' said Ms Zhou. A recent study on nurses in New Zealand showed that people who eat nuts every day have a 20% lower mortality rate, and also tend to be leaner. 'Nuts are also a significant source of protein and fibre while being naturally low in sugar. Nut bars such  are great options, as they are both nutritious and convenient,' she said. A recent study on nurses in New Zealand showed that people who eat nuts every day have a 20% lower mortality rate, and also tend to be leaner . Popcorn is a fantastic snack to be creative with, and can be made sweet or savoury with just a few additions . 4. Pull the udder one. Ms Zhou said that many people will only consume milk in their tea of coffee, a level which is insufficient for obtaining the calcium needed for bone health. Drinking up to four glasses of milk each day can be a way to curb hunger and get protein. 'When it comes to sustaining energy and hunger levels, with minimal carbohydrates, milk is the perfect answer,' said Ms Zhou. 'Not only is it loaded with calcium and vitamin D, its high protein content means you stay full for longer than most other drinks.' 5. Pop it. 'At only 20 calories per cup, natural popcorn is an underrated and reasonably healthy snack,' said Ms Zhou. 'As they are made out of whole grains they are low in glycaemic Index. Plus, the fibre from whole grains help you to feel full on fewer calories, meaning you consume less food overall.' Popcorn is also a fantastic snack to be creative with, and can be made sweet or savoury with just a few additions.","Being deliberate with snacking is one of they keys to keeping weight off .
Grazing between meals on calorie-laden snacks can be a temptation .

Swapping high-fat snacks for low-calorie options is an alternative .

"Plotting? Police have filed a report suggesting Hashim Hanif Ibn Abdul-Rasheed was plotting to hijack an Ohio plane with gas masks and knives . A man fatally shot by police outside an airport had two knives taped to the insides of his legs and his behavior was 'consistent with someone who intended to hijack an aircraft,' a detective's court filing says. Hashim Hanif Ibn Abdul-Rasheed had two 'lock-blade style' knives beneath his trousers and tried to buy an airline ticket using a woman's ID, according to the counterterrorism unit in Columbus, Ohio. Further investigation found he had more knives, a gas mask, other masks, computers, cameras and cellphones in his illegally parked SUV, the statement said. The statement was filed this week as investigators got a search warrant to review data on a cellphone linked to the case. Police said airport officers confronted Abdul-Rasheed after he returned to the vehicle outside Port Columbus International Airport on January 7. They repeatedly fired at him after he moved toward one officer with a knife. The local police union leader said a bomb squad also found containers of frozen urine in the vehicle, an unexplained twist not mentioned in the detective's court filing. Abdul-Rasheed, of suburban Columbus, had a court-documented history of mental illness. After he tried to kill his mother in 1999, a court found him not guilty by reason of insanity and determined he was mentally ill and subject to involuntary hospitalization, Cuyahoga County court records show. He remained under court supervision for more than a decade. Police responded frequently to disturbances at his apartment in the past year. His wife told police officers last summer that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and was not taking his medicine. Crime scene: Abdul-Rasheed was shot dead by his SUV at Port Columbus International Airport after he advanced toward an officer with a knife.

"Learner drivers’ chances of passing their test vary widely depending on where they live, official figures show. Barely a quarter of women and a third of men pass their test in inner city areas like Birmingham. Leeds, London and Bradford. But more than three quarters of drivers in rural  areas get to tear up their L plates after being given the thumbs up by their examiner, in part because they learn drive in fields before they even turn 17. Scroll down for video . Driving test pass rates for women are highest in Ballachulish in Scotland and lowest in South Yardley in Birmingham . Around 1.4million driving tests are carried out each year, although the number has fallen by more than a sixth since before the financial crash. Last year it was announced the driving test could be overhauled, with the three-point turn test scrapped altogether and replaced with parking manoeuvres. Learners could be asked to follow directions on a satnav as part of a radically revised practical exam designed to reflect ‘real-world’ conditions. According to latest figures around half of men pass their test compared to around 43 per cent of women. However there are dramatic differences between test centres in different parts of the country. People living in more affluent areas are likely to be able to afford more lessons before putting in for their test. Those who grew up in the countryside are likely to hone their skills steering a car in the drive or practising clutch skills in a field, long before they turn 17. Pass rates are lower in inner city urban areas, where there are fewer opportunities to practise safely. It is a brave parent who would venture into a city centre with a learner driver at the wheel, especially as they are unlikely to drive very often themselves. For women, the pass rate in 2013-14 was highest in Ballachulish, in the Scottish Highland at 77 per cent. The top 10 areas include the Isle of Skye, Kendal in the Lake District and Barrow in Furness in Lancashire. But contrast, the lowest pass rates were mostly in urban areas, the lowest at the South Yardley test centre in Birmingham, where just 27.4 per cent got their licence. Four of the 10 lowest pass rates were in London, and other areas include Bradford, Heckmondwike in West Yorkshire and the market town of Wednesbury in the West Midlands. Men taking their tests had a higher pass rate on Benbecula Island in the Outer Hebrides and lowest in Belvedere in south east London . The driving test was introduced on March 13, 1935, when were only 1.5 million registered vehicles. The year before the compulsory test was brought in, there were 7,000 people were killed as a result of road accidents. Since its inception, the test has been adapted to reflect advances in car design and changing road layout. Hand signals were removed in 1975 and a video hazard perception test introduced in 2002. Since 1996, drivers have to pass the written Theory Test before they are able to take the practical driving test. Two ""Show me"" ""Tell me"" questions involving vehicle safety were introduced at the beginning of the practical test in September 2003. The Driving Standards Agency conducted 1.5 million driving tests in 2013-14. Just under half of people (47.1 per cent) passed their test last year . There is a similar pattern for men, who had the highest pass rate on the island of Benbecula in the Outer Herbrides (82.6 per cent). Test centres in Wales including Pwllheli, Lampeter and Llandrindod also had high pass rates. Once again, many of the lowest pass rates were in London and the South East, including Belvedere (36.1 per cent), Enfield (40.8 per cent), Barking (36.7 per cent) and Wood Green (39.4 per cent). Some test centres with low pass rates are in areas with high levels of immigration. Since last year all driving tests have to be carried out in English or Welsh, following concerns about fraud involving interpreters. It followed the case of Allyson Ng, who was jailed after selling answers to the written test in Mandarin to 94 people. John Lepine, general manager of the Motor Schools Association, said: ‘The more rural a test centre is, they tend to have a higher pass rates because people in those areas find cheaper insurance, there are more vehicles around, mum and dad are used to taking them out on journeys. ‘People in rural communities tend to be more experienced. An awful lot of them have learnt the skills driving around a field. ‘If you live in an inner city area, it is more expensive to put young people on insurance and you never drive very far. ‘Areas like Wood Green have a high degree of immigration, English is not their first language. They have to do the test in English so that can be a problem.’ He stressed that the variations were the result of differing abilities between those being tested. ‘We are very happy with the consistency of the results across the country.’ A spokesman for the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency said: ‘Pass rates can be influenced by various factors. Some people take more lessons and are better prepared for the test. Statistical factors can also play a part as the number of tests conducted at different test centres varies significantly. ‘We train examiners to a high standard and closely monitor their work to ensure that all tests are assessed consistently across the country.’","Half of men and 43% of women pass their test each year, figures show .

"They may have intelligent sales techniques and an ability to make viewers splash the cash on items they do not necessarily need - but astronomy  is clearly not these QVC presenters' strong point. This hilarious video shows the moment two presenters on the shopping channel go from selling a cardigan to discussing whether the Moon is a star or a planet. As on of the presenters, Jane Treacy, displays the garish outfit, she says it looks like Earth as viewed from beyond 'planet Moon'. Facepalm: A model (right) on the QVC cringes as the two hosts discuss whether the moon is a planet or a star . In the clip from QVC earlier this week, Ms Treacy says the cardigan 'kind of looks like what the Earth looks like when you're a bazillion miles away from the planet Moon'. Co-host designer Isaac Mizrahi replies: 'The planet Moon...' After hearing it out loud for herself, Ms Treacy appears to realise she has made a mistake in turning the conversation from fashion to science. She backtracks with: 'Isn't the Moon a star?' 'The Moon is a planet, darling,' Mr Mizrahi incorrectly tells her. The show descends into a bizarre argument as the hosts try to work out what the Moon - Earth's only natural satellite - and the Sun are. Forgetting they are meant to be selling the cardigans, the presenters continue their argument, asking viewers to Google what the Moon is . Ms Treacy says: 'Is the Moon really a planet? Don’t look at me like that. The Sun is a star ... Is the Sun not a star?' Mr Mizrahi replies: 'I don’t know what the Sun is.' Viewers are then asked to Google the answer to help the confused co-hosts, who seem to have lost all interest in selling clothes. 'So what else is it?' Mr Mizrahi asks. Ms Treacy replies: 'I believe it's a star ... or something.' She adds: 'I feel like sometimes, though I am educated, I expose in this show that this blonde could be real.' Viewers of the video on YouTube were amazed at the 'shameful display of scientific illiteracy'. One user, called Troy, wrote: 'This should serve as inspiration. The man who believes the Moon is a planet ""that things live on"" is a millionaire who was a household name in the 90s for his eponymous fashion line. If he can do it, we all can. ' User paddles409 added: 'The moon is a hollow, artificial satellite inhabited by giant, superior, hyperintelligent, ants. Hail Ants!' The Moon is neither a star or a planet, it is Earth's only natural satellite. Thought to have formed 4.5 billion years ago, scientists believe it is made from debris left from an impact between Earth and a large planet. It orbits our planet around once every four weeks, with one side of the Moon always facing Earth. Despite being more than 238,000 miles away, Earth's tides are mostly generated by the Moon's gravitational pull. The first human to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong in 1969, with a total of 12 astronauts setting foot on the satellite. No one has visited the Moon since 1972. Other planets in the solar system have moons, but Earth is the only one with a singular satellite.","Video shows QVC presenters arguing over composition of the Moon .

"Police in one of the most affluent boroughs in London have been told to stop all prestige cars which are being driven after midnight after a spate of thefts using 'keyless' entry methods. Officers in Kensington & Chelsea have been ordered to check the details of every driver of luxury cars such as Range Rovers and BMWs to ensure they are the rightful owner after Range Rover thefts soared from 23 in 2013, to 165 last year. Last month alone saw a huge rise in thefts in the area with three Range Rovers and one other luxury car stolen from a Chelsea street within  weeks. Police warned as many as ten vehicles per night were being stolen with the method in some boroughs. Scroll down for video . A Range Rover sport is stolen by thieves using a hand-held electronic device to bypass they keyless entry . Almost half of vehicles stolen in London are taken through keyless theft, which includes towing and key cloning, according to recent crime figures from the Met. Using specialist equipment available online, organised criminals are able to make a key that can start the car without triggering the alarm in under a minute. CCTV captured one brazen thief who casually clicking open the lock systems of a Range Rover, worth £85,000, before driving away demonstrates the ease with which criminals are stealing the luxury vehicles. In another case, property developer Laura van Bilderbeek, 38, had her BMW estate stolen from outside her home on Ormonde Gate in Chelsea last month. Scotland Yard says thefts of Range Rovers now make up 10 per cent of all 'keyless' thefts in the capital - while BMW makes up 15 per cent of the total. Met chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said thieves were  buying devices for as little as £50 on the internet which allowed them replicate cars' electronic entry keys or using a device to insert into the ignition systems. Laura van Bilderbeek from Chelsea who had her high end BMW stolen by thieves using and ebay electronics gear . He said: 'Until we get that design problem sorted out we have a problem and my concern is that the number of cars being stolen will rise. This could very quickly become an issue.' But car manufacturers have blamed EU regulations which mean the technology to programme the keys had to be available to organisations outside the dealer network- making it easier for gangs to get their hands on them. A spokesman for Jaguar Land Rover said: 'This is an industry-wide issue, as European legislation forces all car makers to make available information about their diagnostic systems, including any security updates. Criminal gangs are using high-tech tactics to keep one step ahead of car manufacturers. Using specialist equipment which is available online from as little as £50, they are able to break into some vehicles in under a minute. Thieves use a hand-held device which they use as a 'key' to unlock the car without triggering the alarm. In some cases, this 'key' transmits the same frequency as a vehicle's entry fob and then hacks through thousands of code until it successfully finds the one that unlocks the car. Criminals then dismantle them to remove the vehicles’ electronic tracking devices and the cars are often shipped to eastern Europe. 'Together with the SMMT, we are pressing for a change to the law, to prevent the abuse of that open access.' Around 24,000 cars were stolen in London last year - compared to 23,000 the previous year. A spokesman for luxury car manufacturer BMW added: 'It's a technology race between ourselves and the criminal gangs.' 'This is still a relatively rare type of theft. 'Because of EU regulations, (criminal gangs) are able to buy technology to help programme the keys which are used for the thefts. 'EU regulations are there to allow organisations to provide servicing for cars outside the dealer network but it also means it's legal to buy this key programming equipment. It makes it very difficult for manufacturers to control.' Assistant Commissioner Helen King, who is in charge of Territorial Policing, said owners of certain makes of car were urged to use steering or crook locks to  secure them with BMW, Range Rovers and Land Rovers, a particular target for thieves. She told the Evening Standard: 'In Kensington and Chelsea with the density of Range Rovers being stolen there, they are literally instructing officers to stop that make of vehicle when they see it to check it is the legitimate owner who is driving it. 'We are encouraging owners to use that somewhat unsophisticated devices such as crook locks.' Police have launched an operation codenamed Endeavor to combat the thefts in the worst hit boroughs. A Met spokesman said all boroughs were 'keenly aware of the threat of vehicle theft' and are using a range of tactics to tackle it. Assistant Commissioner Helen King  said BMW, Range Rovers (pictured is a Range Rover Sport) and Land Rovers, in particular, were being targeted by the theft gangs . In Kensington and Chelsea, this meant officers were currently stopping prestige vehicles seen being driven in the area after midnight, when many vehicle thefts take place. Figures from Thatcham Research, the motor insurers' research centre, show that between January and July 2014 almost 300 Range Rover Evoques and Range Rover Sports were stolen in London, along with 63 BMW X5s and Series 3 models. A spokesman for Jaguar Land Rover admitted the thefts were 'an extremely serious issue for the automotive industry' and said the company had installed a number of updates to try and keep one step ahead of the criminal gangs. 'At Jaguar Land Rover, we have been working closely with the Metropolitan Police and other forces across the country and this has resulted in a number of prosecutions. We have a dedicated engineering team continuously developing new technologies to try to stay one step ahead of criminal gangs. We are now introducing our fourth upgrade, which we are confident, will address the latest theft mechanisms being used.'","London Borough of Kensington & Chelsea saw a spike in keyless car thefts .

"He's one sixth of the UK's most famous family, so it's no surprise that Romeo Beckham holds some pretty substantial pulling power. In fact it's been reported that thanks to his most recent Burberry advert, sales of the brand's classic £1,500 trench coats have gone up a substantial 10 per cent. The fashion label has credited the 12-year-old son of David and Victoria Beckham for its rise in sales in the US, Europe and the Middle East after he starred in their Christmas advert last year. Scroll down for video . Romeo Beckham wore the classic Burberry trench in the advert along with a smart Burberry scarf and umbrella . In the three months to the end of December, better-than-expected sales of Burberry coats, bags and fashion climbed 14 per cent to £600m. In the four-minute festive film, Romeo wears the trench, a monogrammed scarf and carries a Burberry umbrella to match his outfit. The advert, which was first released in November, was the first ever Christmas campaign for Burberry and starred Romeo  alongside 50 dancers all clad in the beige trench coats. Such was his popularity in the film called From London With Love that it was watched nine million times after being released. Simon Fuller - who previously managed the Spice Girls - is reported to have negotiated a £45,000 fee for Romeo; something which Burberry has declined to comment on in the past. Romeo looked smart in a Burberry suit and scarf at the launch of its festive campaign in November . Burberry’s finance director Carol Fairweather previously said: ‘I don’t sign off every invoice that comes into the building. 'I don’t make those decisions. It’s not for me to comment on what arrangements were paid to Romeo,' when questioned about his fee. However it seems it the figure is accurate, it could have been money well spent.

"Jade Jarratt has been left furious after her son Jaron Smith scaled a school fence and walked home without his teachers noticing . The mother of a five-year-old boy has hit out at her son's school after he managed to scale a playground fence and complete the 10-minute walk home without teachers noticing. Jade Jarratt assumed her son Jaron Smith was happily enjoying this day at Cobblers Lane Primary School in Pontefract, West Yorkshire,  after he was dropped off at the gate. But she was left horrified when the youngster suddenly strolled through their front door at 1pm - having walked across a busy main road unaccompanied. Warehouse worker and mother-of-three Miss Jarratt said: 'Jaron had to cross two roads to get back to our house and anything could have happened in that time. 'One of them is a main road that is really busy and I would never let him cross that on his own. 'I was told by the headteacher that a member of staff had asked him to come away from the fence because it had been raining and it was wet. 'But despite them seeing him by the fence, he's still managed to get over without anybody going after him. 'I was really upset when I realised he was on his own. I was crying and just thinking about all the things that could have happened. So many things were going through my head. 'It is a seven-foot fence and has parts of the fence sticking out at the top, so he could have really hurt himself. 'He told me that a friend had told him to do it and then he said he was really scared climbing down the other side and just wanted to come home to see his mum.' Miss Jarratt, who is also mother to two-year-old Tylen Northway and one-year-old Emzileigh Northway, said she is still waiting for an apology from the school. Five-year-old Jaron climbed over this fence before embarking on the 10-minute walk home last week . He said his friend dared him to climb the fence and he then got scared and wanted to see his mother . Miss Jarratt said: 'The incident is appalling. It's not a bad school by any means but you put a lot of trust in teachers to look after your children and this has made me doubt that. Anything could have happened to Jaron. 'He had to cross Baghill Lane on his way home, which is a busy road. He could have been hit by a car or someone could have taken him. 'The first thing I heard from the school was when I was on my way to take Jaron back there. 'The headteacher rang to ask if Jaron had turned up at home. It's a good job he had as nobody from the school had gone after him. I am far from happy about the way the school dealt with the incident.' Miss Jarratt drove Jaron back to school  and was met by his father Robert Smith, 28, who works at the nearby One Stop, before going to see the headteacher. She added: 'The headteacher didn't even apologise for what happened. She said it was his responsibility not to climb the fence but he is a five-year-old. 'They have a duty of care to protect our children and I don't feel like they have done that.' Miss Jarratt has hit out at the school, which she says failed in its duty of care towards her young son . Jaron had to walk down five separate roads during his unaccompanied walk home, crossing one busy route . Headteacher Karen Briggs said she was confident school staff followed procedures when dealing with the incident last Thursday and the family had been kept 'fully informed.' Mrs Briggs said: 'The safety and well being of all pupils is always a top priority in our school. 'However, we are never complacent when it comes to child safety and will be reviewing this to see if there's anything we could have done to prevent this happening. 'We kept the family fully informed during the incident. The parents brought the child back to school on the same day. 'When we spoke to the parents they said they were happy with how the school had dealt with the incident. 'Teachers have spoken to pupils and have reiterated the importance of not climbing the fence or leaving school premises unsupervised.'","Youngster clambered over fence and walked home during lunch break .

"The judge in the Jodi Arias case denied a bid by her lawyers to stop prosecutors from seeking the death penalty . The judge in the Jodi Arias case on Wednesday denied a bid by her lawyers to stop prosecutors from seeking the death penalty. Arias was convicted in May 2013 of murdering her ex-boyfriend, Travis Alexander, at his suburban Phoenix home. But jurors are deadlocked on whether she should be sentenced to life in prison or death. A new jury was picked to decide her sentence, and her sentencing retrial is ongoing. Arias' attorneys had asked Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens to dismiss a notice by prosecutors that they are seeking the death penalty on several grounds. They alleged that authorities examining Alexander's laptop destroyed thousands of files — including files from pornographic websites — that would have been beneficial in defending Arias. They said the computer files could have helped them argue that Alexander had treated their client in a sexually humiliating manner. Arias' lawyers also asked the judge to dismiss the death penalty because three witnesses on her behalf have refused to testify in open court for fear they will be harassed. In a ruling Wednesday, Stephens denied all of the motions to take the death penalty off the table. 'Many of those motions alleged prosecutorial misconduct. The cumulative effect of those allegations does not require dismissal of the charges or the notice of intent to seek the death penalty,' Stephens wrote. 'There may have been errors made, but those errors were not so egregious that they create concerns about the integrity or fundamental fairness of the trial.' Prosecutor Juan Martinez has denied authorities mishandled computer evidence.

Jodi Arias defense attorney Jennifer Willmott leaves a bench conference in Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix on Wednesday . Prosecutors have argued that Arias attacked Alexander in a jealous rage after he wanted to end their affair and planned a trip to Mexico with another woman. Arias has acknowledged killing Alexander, but claimed it was self-defense after he attacked her. The Arias case has been marked by secrecy since the conclusion of the first trial, where salacious and violent details about Arias and Alexander were broadcast live around the world. Since then, the judge has held one secret hearing after another and barred the broadcast of footage from the sentencing retrial until after a verdict is reached.","Arias was convicted in 2013 of murdering ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander .

"Muhammad Ali has been admitted to hospital for the second time in four weeks after he was found in an unresponsive state by guests staying at his Scottsdale, Arizona home. The former champion boxer needed follow-up care related to the severe urinary tract infection he was hospitalized with on December 20. He's in a stable condition, Ali family spokesman Bob Gunnell said. ""There were still issues with the urinary tract infection,"" Gunnell said of Ali's latest hospitalization. Released:  Muhammad Ali(above) is back in the hospital after he was found asleep in his bed and unresponsive . Ali 'went to bed Tuesday night, but didn’t wake up in the afternoon or evening the next day. He was sleeping for 24 hours,' a source told Radar Online.  'He wasn’t responding,' the source said . 'They thought he might be too exhausted,' added the source. The three-time world heavyweight champion was released from a hospital on January 6, and headed home to celebrate his 73rd birthday on January 17 with his family and friends. 'My daddy is a strong man. He's so resilient and we're all very grateful and blessed,' daughter Rasheda Ali-Walsh said earlier this week. Ali, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, was diagnosed with the brain disease about three years after he retired from boxing in 1981. Ali's public appearances have diminished in recent years as he continues to battle Parkinson's disease, but he still enjoys getting out and watching sports and visiting friends.

"Grammar school-educated British jihadist Shabazz Suleman claims Turkish police fed him Domino's pizza in jail before handing him over to ISIS in a prisoner exchange which led to a diplomatic storm . A grammar school-educated British jihadist has claimed Turkish police fed him Domino's pizza in jail before handing him over to ISIS in a prisoner exchange which led to a diplomatic storm. Shabazz Suleman, 19, a former pupil at the Royal Grammar School in High Wycombe, was among as many as 180 fighters handed back to Islamic State by Turkey in return for the release of diplomats. The swap, involving 46 Turkish citizens and three local Iraqi staff who were captured when IS stormed the Iraqi city of Mosul in June, has sparked a diplomatic row, with Turkey already under pressure from fellow UN members to secure its borders with Syria. Speaking for the first time since the deal in September, Suleman has claimed he and fellow captives were able to contact ISIS from internet in their cells, and that the Turkish police guarding him had expressed sympathy with their cause - and even bought them pizza. 'Cops were very friendly,' Suleman told The Times' John Simpson and Alex Christie-Miller via an online exchange from ISIS stronghold Raqqa. 'Understood why we wanted to fight in Syria. They hated Assad, Israel etc. Their ideology was that of the Muslim brotherhood. 'It was good lol. Had pizza in prison. Dominos lol. Was allowed net. We spoke to dawla [ISIS] in prison. Watched ISIS videos. Sang nasheeds [Islamic chants].' Suleman, who now calls himself Abu Shamil Al-Muslim, is thought to have joined jihadis in Syria after giving his parents the slip to cross the border while on holiday in Turkey. The teenager, who was described by his old school as 'a valued, hardworking student', had achieved good A-level results last summer and had a place lined up to study at Keele University, where he had wanted to study International Relations. Former pupils at his old school include Secretary of State for Justice Chris Grayling, comedian Jimmy Carr, England rugby players Nick Beale, Matt Dawson, and Tom Rees, golfer Luke Donald and singer Ian Dury. In a statement released in October, after news emerged that Suleman had gone to Syria, the school said: 'During his time at RGS, Shabazz was a very engaging and amiable student who fitted in well, forming good relationships with his peers and staff. Shabazz had a good work ethic, and was prepared to play a prominent role in class discussions, even though he gave the impression of being a rather reserved and quiet person. Suleman (pictured) claims he and fellow captives were able to contact ISIS from internet in their cells, and that the Turkish police guarding him had expressed sympathy with their cause - and even bought them pizza . 'He showed real determination to achieve good academic results, working hard to build on his AS grades to achieve a solid set of A levels in History, Economics and Psychology and so gained a place at University. Shabazz was a valued, hardworking student who achieved well and respected the school’s academic and pastoral ethos.' But Suleman, who had travelled to Aleppo, Syria with an aid convoy in 2013, is believed to have been radicalised by jihadis he met on Twitter. He is also thought to have attended the Muslim Education Centre in High Wycombe, where one of the British men convicted in the 2006 transatlantic liquid bomb plot also attended. It is around the corner from the teenager’s £400,000 detached family home. Suleman's mother had previously denied claims he has travelled to the Middle East for violent reasons, telling the press: 'He has gone to do aid work there'. The Muslim Education Centre has said it was shocked by Suleman’s departure and has condemned the activities of ISIS. His parents had reported him missing to both British police and the Turkish authorities, and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office had also reported him missing. Suleman, who received weapons training at a two-week Sharia training camp, said he had been caught by security services at the Syrian border. He said he was visited twice by Turkish intelligence agency MIT, fined, and told he was going to be deported. The teenager, described by Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe (pictured) as 'a valued, hardworking student', had achieved good A-level results last summer and had a place lined up to study at Keele University . He said he was held along with 35 other ISIS fighters at an 'open' prison in Sanliurfa, around an hour from the Turkish-Syrian border. Suleman, who is now in Raqqa where his duties involve being on sentry guard, said he had been given the choice of being deported, or being part of the ISIS exchange. He wrote: 'After a month of waiting they told us buses are waiting outside for u. MIT ran the exchange. Told us we are free. Exchanged at border, We drove into dawla.' Three French citizens, two Swedes, two Macedonians, one Swiss, and one Belgian are also believed to have been part of the exchange, as well as another Briton, Hisham Folkard, 26. The deal is understood to have been brokered through complex talks with tribes and rebel militia.","Shabazz Suleman studied at the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe .

"A lesbian couple has staged a kissing protest outside the home of the Duggar family, the stars of TLC’s 19 Kids And Counting, who are well known for their Conservative Christian values and intolerance toward homosexuality. Texas couple Tandra Barnfield and Samantha Muzny say they are big fans of the reality show but are unhappy that patriarch Jim Bob, his wife Michelle and their clan so publicly oppose their wish to get married. The gay couple, who have three children, were visiting relatives in Tontitown, Arkansas, on Saturday when they decided to stop and have a photo taken of them kissing outside the Duggar’s home. Scroll down for video . Texas couple Tandra Barnfield and Samantha Muzny say they are big fans of the reality show but are unhappy about the Duggar family's intolerance toward homosexuality . ‘My cousin lives just a few doors down from the Duggars. When we saw the house, it just lit a fire underneath us,’ Barnfield told Radar. ‘I said, “Let’s go make out!” My sister took the photo.’ Despite one of Michelle’s own sisters being in a lesbian relationship, the family have been very public about their feelings about homosexuality. In November the Duggars deleted photos of same-sex couples kissing from their official Facebook page after they had asked people to share photos, while oldest son Josh recently led an Arkansas rally protesting against gay marriage. ‘I want to get married to my girlfriend. And the Duggars are fighting my right to do so,’ said Barnfield. ‘It upsets me. If you won’t let me get married, I’m going to make out with my girlfriend in front of you.’ Despite the couple’s frustration with the Duggars’ stance on gay marriage, they say they are long-time fans of the hit show. ‘We love the Duggars, we watch their show all the time,’ said Barnfield. ‘I also have morals and love God. They sit there and say they love everybody too, but then they fight against my rights.’ Big love: The Duggar family is a part of an evangelical Christian movement that urges women to have as many children as God gives them . ‘They marry off their daughters to men very young. I don’t protest their lifestyle!’ The couple live with their children just outside Houston and are hoping that the law in their state changes soon so they can go ahead and tie the knot. The relationship between Michelle Duggar’s older sister Evelyn Ruark, 63, and her partner Sharon Callahan, 52, has never been mentioned on 19 Kids And Counting. Just as the Duggars have issues with homosexuals so too Michelle’s family have concerns over her unusual lifestyle choices and extreme Christian beliefs. Speaking to The National Enquirer in 2010, Sharon described herself as a ‘significant other’ of Evelyn and revealed the couple’s concerns about the Duggar family’s ties to the Quiverfull movement. ‘We are worried about them,’ Sharon said. ‘We have often thought that Quiverfull is a cult. It appears to be brainwashing to me.’ Texas couple Tandra Barnfield, left, and Samantha Muzny, right, have three kids together and say they are eager to get married once the law changes in their home state . Quiverfull is a movement among some conservative evangelical Protestant couples that promotes procreation, eschews all forms of birth control and sees children as a blessing from God. Evelyn featured in an early episode of the reality show when the Duggar family had a get together with Michelle's siblings and her father. Girlfriend Sharon wasn't featured or even mentioned in the episode. Ruark and her girlfriend aren’t the only members of the Duggar’s extended family whose lifestyle is at odds with their ultra-conservative family values. Susanna Keller, a sister of Josh Duggar’s wife Anna, is reported to have had a child outside of wedlock. Josh, the eldest Duggar son, moved from Arkansas to DC a year and a half ago to work for the conservative lobbying group the Family Research Council, where he is an Executive Director. The Duggars’ conservative Christian values and close-knit family has made 19 Kids and Counting one of TLC’s most successful shows. Michelle Duggar, matriarch of the conservative Christian stars of TLC’s 19 Kids And Counting, has an older sister, Evelyn Ruark, right, who is a lesbian with a long-term partner . But accusations of gay ‘fear-mongering’ appeared to threaten the reality show’s future in November, when more than 180,000 people signed a petition asking the network to end the series after anti-equality comments made by Michelle. In August the mom had lent her star power for a campaign to strike down an ordinance that would prohibit businesses from discriminating against gender and sexual orientation. Her voice was used in a robocall message sent to Fayetteville, Arkansas, residents that asked them to vote against the ordinance that would protect members of the gay and transgender communities. She said: 'I don’t believe the citizens of Fayetteville would want males with past child predator convictions that claim they are female to have a legal right to enter private areas that are reserved for women and girls.' The series had returned for ninth season in September. The political move prompted a petition on Change.org launched by Jim Wissick to axe the show after hearing Duggar's words that he said 'reek of ignorance and fear mongering.' Evelyn appeared in one episode of 19 Kids and Counting where Michelle visited her Ruark relatives, but for the most part she hasn’t been featured on the show . He wrote on the petition page: 'Just because someone is transgendered doesn't mean they are a child predator or a rapist. The claim that this ordinance would provide predators with access to women's restrooms in order to assault or leer at girls or women is nothing more than fear-mongering and spreading ignorance and hatred.' Supports of the Duggars have launched a rival petition to keep the show on TV, which raised over 12,000 votes. 'Many that may or may not agree with their personal beliefs, but this does not mean that they shouldn't be allowed their reality show or that they should be attacked for their personal beliefs,' the organizer wrote. Last month Michelle's husband Jim Bob Duggar said he wasn’t worried about by the petition. 'They won't succeed,' the 49-year-old said. 'Our show is the number one show on TLC. It’s a small group creating this fuss. All it has done is give us more exposure.' In November the Duggars deleted photos of same-sex couples, above, kissing from their official Facebook page after they had asked people to share photos . He told The Pathway, an evangelical Christian publication run by the Missouri Baptist Convention, that they family gained 50,000 Facebook fans following the outcry. Michelle Ruark was born the youngest of Garrett and Ethel Ruark’s seven children; her five sisters and brother were named Pam, Evelyn, Carol, Freda, Kathie, and Garrett Jr. She was quite a bit younger than most of her siblings, and when the family relocated from Arkansas to Ohio in the early 80s, she stayed behind to marry Jim Bob. There have been rumors that the Ruarks, who are not strongly religious, don’t agree with Michelle and Jim Bob’s way of life.","Texas couple Tandra Barnfield and Samantha Muzny say they are unhappy about the Duggar family's intolerance toward homosexuality .

"A thrill-seeking woman has escaped with her life after swimming drunk in crocodile-infested waters at Scotts Creek in the Djukbinj National Park. The 21-year-old Northern Territory woman had spent the day 'fishing and having drinks' at the shore and stepped into the water to cool off, despite knowing that there was a five-metre crocodile lurking nearby. Her friend Isha Yilmaz said she laughed when her friend jumped into the water and 'thought it was funny.' Scroll down for video . A thrill-seeking woman has escaped with her life after swimming drunk in crocodile-infested waters at Scotts Creek in the Djukbinj National Park . Ms Yilmaz said she wasn't worried about her friend being attacked by a crocodile and would have had no hesitations following her into the water. Her friend commented that being able to drink beers and swim in the water was 'the best part of being a territorian'. 'The water was crystal clear, I would have gone in after her. We know the area really well, we all swim in the creeks and drink a few beers up here,' 40-year-old Yilmaz told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Yilmaz, from Humpty Doo in the Northern Territory, said the pair had been enjoying a day of drinking by the creek with friends and that her friend was the first person to brave the murky waters. The 21-year-old Northern Territory woman had spent the day 'fishing and having drinks' at  Scott's Creek (pictured) and stepped into the water to cool off, despite knowing that there was a five-metre crocodile lurking nearby . Isha photographed a crocodiles footprint in the mud two months before her friend took a dip in the croc-infested water. There was a a 12 gauge shot gun shell left in the footprint . She said there were 'heaps' of people in the area and once they saw her friend enter the water, they all decided to jump in. 'There was a family there and their young kids were in the water. They went further up the creek and I wouldn't recommend that,' she said. A four-metre saltwater crocodile was spotted in the area a few months ago and was killed when a rogue hunter shot it in the head. Djukinj National Park in the Northern Terriroty is known for it's crocodile population . Over 100 crocodiles were removed from Top End waterways in 2014 and sent to croc farms . The pair have been swimming in the creek since they were kids and weren't bothered by reports that a five-metre monster crocodile had taken up residence in the area. 'We're aware of the croc population up here and we did check it out, the water was clear.' she said. Over 100 crocodiles were removed from Top End waterways in 2014 and sent to croc farms. The Northern Territory government have expressed their concern at the public interference with the crocodiles in the Northern Territory . To the shock of onlookers the man is seen fishing waist-deep in crocodile infested waters . The Northern Territory government have expressed their concern at the public interference with the crocodiles in the Northern Territory. 'Saltwater crocodiles can just about be anywhere at any time so I urge everyone to stay safe and Be Crocwise in and around waterways' Senior Wildlife Ranger Tom Nichols said. 'I remind anyone heading into or near our waterways that croc danger is real, so don't risk your life.' Last week, onlookers were left dumbfounded by the behaviour of a man, who spent 'at least 15 minutes' wading into croc-infested water at Shady Camp on the Mary River in the Northern Territory. Jason Rogers was there fishing nearby and photographed the man in the water. He said that at the time there was a four-and-half-foot crocodile floating within 50 metres of where the man was fishing. Initially the fisherman just stood off the shore in shallow water as he fished . Mr Rogers had been fishing from the bank before the man arrived and caught 15 barramundi before the man started out into the water. 'He was in there for at least 15 minutes. When he was out in the water you couldn't even have shouted to him to warn him that a crocodile was coming because the river was rushing so strongly. I'll never know how he didn't get eaten,' he said. It's believed that the man was from Darwin Mr Rogers said, and that he had fished in the area before for barramundi.","A woman has been pictured swimming in croc-infested waters .

"Ann Salter was spared jail despite admitting to fraudulently claiming more than £65,000 in benefits . A journalist who swindled £65,000 in benefits after claiming she was too depressed to work has been spared jail. Ann Salter from Shepperton, Spelthorn, was given thousands in housing benefit, income support and tax relief over ten years after telling council officials she couldn't work. The 49-year-old was discovered by investigators after posting a showreel online, boasting of work as a health expert and television presenter. Despite admitting to fraudulently claiming £65,478 over the course of a decade, she was today described as a 'a lady of good character' and spared jail after 'striving' to repay the sum. Guildford Crown Court heard how Salter, who described herself as a 'successful writer' and presenter in an online CV, had 'sheer determination in recognising her wrongdoing'. Despite fraudulently claiming thousands, the woman, who listed working on BBC radio programmes among her experience as a presenter, was of 'good character'. She was given a year-long prison sentence suspended for 18 months, ordered to pay £5,000 in addition to the money she fraudulently claimed and told to complete 200 hours in community service. 'You are a lady of hitherto good character, and you have positive good character letters in your favour,' said Jude Peter Moss. ‘You have shown much kindness to others as a volunteer... but some feel you do not look after yourself. ‘One of the ways you didn't look after yourself was by claiming benefits to which you were not entitled. ‘This was a serious matter involving public money that should not have gone to you. ‘The total sum involved over that 10-year period was some £65,000. False claims: The presenter, pictured, was caught after she posted a showreel online as part of a CV covering her work on television and radio. The list included guest presenting on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour . ‘To your credit you admitted these offences and I give you full credit for that. ‘To your credit you have striven to repay that money and indicate the desire to repay the other sums outstanding. The court heard Ms Salter was of 'hitherto good character' ‘This goes some way to mitigating the offences. There is no more powerful mitigation than by recognising what you did wrong.' Defending counsel Darren Flick said Salter had missed out on work opportunities as a result of the negativity brought to her reputation by the court case. He added she was a 'caring and vulnerable' woman. However campaigners said a tougher line was needed in order to deter criminals from fraudulently claiming benefits. 'We need to cut benefit fraud down to zero, and that means coming down hard on the minority who attempt to cheat the system,' said Andy Silvester, Campaigns Director for the Taxpayers Alliance. 'It's up to judges to decide on individual cases, but it's important that we remember benefit fraud isn't just stealing from hard-pressed taxpayers but takes money away from those who really need the safety net. 'It's right that the money is paid back, of course, but if that's the only punishment then clearly a minority will try their luck.' Among clips used in her show-reel is footage of the woman presenting for the International Business Times.","Ann Salter swindled £65,478 over ten years by claiming she could not work .

"As the property market begins to heat up for 2015 the best performing areas of the last year have been revealed, demonstrating the best growth in the last 12 months actually occurred far from the nation's CBDs. The areas that recorded the best growth in each state and territory around Australia have been detailed in a report by property investment website Hotspotting. Hotspotting founder Terry Ryder said the top picks for 2014 were based not just on median house price growth but also on sales volume – which points to price growth in 2015. Scroll down for video .

Victoria - Sunshine . South Australia - Onkaparinga . Tasmania - Kingborough . Western Australia - Busselton . Northern Territory - New Palmerston . 'We prefer sales volume as it's a precursor to future price growth,' he said. 'There's time lag between sale and price growth activity and it can take six to nine months before you can see result of that upturn.' Mr Ryder said the best growth markets were not 'millionaire suburbs', despite the fact they got much of the attention in 2014. 'Certainly in Sydney and Melbourne the upturn started with those so-called prime suburbs,' Mr Ryder told Daily Mail Australia. 'But by the time we'd got to the second half of 2014 the best growth in those cities was being reported in the middle-ring and outer-ring suburbs. 'It starts in the top-end suburbs then gradually ripples out.'

But he warned against using the top picks for 2014 - including Penrith in Sydney and Sunshine in Melbourne – as an indicator of the best growth areas for 2015. 'I think we're going to see different locations showing biggest growth this year,' he said. 'The biggest growth has been had in Sydney and Melbourne, what we're seeing now is the rise of Brisbane.'

This is due to the city's affordablity, good rental yields and planned infrastructure. SOUTH AUSTRALIA: ONKAPARINGA . The best area in South Australia was the City of Onkaparinga council, 25-40km south of the Adelaide CBD. Hotspotting pointed to its wine district and affordable bayside suburbs, including Seaford and Aldinga Beach, as major drawcards. Sales volumes grew off the back of good population growth. Sales activity in Tasmania was on the rise in 2014 after two years of little growth. Hobart (pictured is the suburb Mount Nelson) performed particularly well, with the best area being suburbs in the Kingborough local government area in the capital city's south . Rising sales in Kingston, Kingston Beach and Blackmans Bay were expected to drive price growth in 2015 . TASMANIA: KINGBOROUGH . Sales activity in Tasmania was on the rise in 2014 after two years of little growth. Hobart performed particularly well, with the best area being suburbs in the Kingborough local government area in the capital city's south. Rising sales in Kingston, Kingston Beach and Blackmans Bay were expected to drive price growth in 2015. WESTERN AUSTRALIA: BUSSELTON . The best growth markets in WA in 2014 were south of Perth, a departure from the previous trend which saw mining towns perform best. Several suburbs in the City of Busselton, 220 kilometres south west of Perth, recorded double-digit growth in median prices last year. NORTHERN TERRITORY: NEW PALMERSTON . The growth areas in Darwin were suburbs in the city of Palmerston, 22km south-east of the CBD, based on new construction projects. But this did not translate to price growth.

"A stress-blocking drug can be used as a 'compassion pill' to increase empathy, a new study has found. The research also provides the first evidence that stress can sap the caring instincts of humans, which could explain some of the terrible acts of cruelty which are committed in the heat of conflict. Scientists found that stress undermined empathy both in laboratory mice experiments and student volunteer trials involving friends or strangers immersing their hands in freezing cold water. A stress-blocking drug can be used as a 'compassion pill' that increases empathy, the ability to feel another's pain, a study has shown (stock picture) In both cases, treatment with the stress hormone blocking drug metyrapone reduced the effect and increased the ability to empathise. Metyrapone is a pill commonly used to treat Cushing's syndrome, a condition that causes the body to produce excess levels of the stress hormone cortisol. A similar result was achieved in the human study using a popular video game to boost social interaction between the student volunteers. Study leader Dr Jeffrey Mogil, from McGill University in Canada, said: 'We found what in some sense might be thought of as the 'secret' to empathy; that is, what prevents it from occurring more often between strangers. 'It is quite intriguing indeed that this phenomenon appears to be identical in mice and humans. First, it supports the notion that mice are capable of more complex social phenomena than is commonly believed. Second, it suggests that human social phenomena might actually be simpler than commonly believed, at least in terms of their organising principles.' Previous research by the same team has demonstrated that mice experience empathy - once thought to be a wholly human ability - but only when they are known to each other. Two cage-mates given a painful experience will feel it more than when each of them undergoes the same experience alone. The research found evidence that stress can sap the caring instincts of humans while treatment with the stress hormone blocking drug metyrapone reduced the effect and increased the ability to empathise (stock picture) In the new study, published in the journal Current Biology, mice were subjected to mild pain by injecting them with acetic acid. As before, cage-mates - but not strangers - who suffered the same experience together showed a greater reaction than they did when injected alone. When they were treated with metyrapone, the mice began showing the same level of empathy to strangers as they did to their cage-mates. This suggested it was the stress of being with a stranger that previously inhibited their empathy. A similar response was seen in the undergraduate volunteers. When friends were paired together and told to hold their hands in iced water, they reported a greater sensation of pain than individuals on their own or two strangers undergoing the same experience. Treatment with metyrapone caused students to feel more empathy for people they viewed as strangers. After taking the pill, participants not only reported more pain but also displayed more pained expressions on their faces. They also touched their hands more often when witnessing another person's pain. The scientists found that asking students to play the music video game Rock Band for just 15 minutes had as much effect on empathy as the drug. 'It turns out that even a shared experience that is as superficial as playing a video game together can move people from the 'stranger zone' to the 'friend zone' and generate meaningful levels of empathy,' said Dr Mogil. He added: 'President Barack Obama has described an 'empathy deficit' that fuels misunderstanding, divisions, and conflict. This research identifies a reason for the empathy gap and answers the vital question of how do we create empathy between strangers.'","Research found that stress can sap the caring instincts of humans .

"A toy designer and sculptor has created what is quite possibly the scariest baby bed in the world, modeling the intricately-designed cot on a scene from Steven Spielberg's 1975 cult shark thriller Jaws. Joseph Reginella, from Staten Island, New York, used Styrofoam to build the terrifying design, which makes it appear as though the sleeping baby is lying on the deck of a boat, which is being consumed by a toothy shark. Speaking to CNET, the designer, who is a long-time fan of Jaws, explained that he came up with the unique concept while working on another custom bed design. Shark attack! Joseph Reginella created this unique baby bed for his childhood friend's two-month-old son Mikey (pictured) No more tears: While the images might suggest otherwise, Mikey's family insist that he is thrilled with his new bed . Meet the designer: Reginella (pictured) is a long-time Jaws fan and spent just one week working on the bed . 'At a shop, we made an airplane bed for some little kid in California, and I thought it would be funny if someone would order a terrifying bed instead of something mainstream,' he explained. Reginella was given the final prompt he needed to actually create the bed, after discovering that his childhood friend was expecting a baby boy. 'When I found out my childhood buddy Mark and his wife were having a boy, I said, ""I gotta make this,""' he added. And while some of the images might suggest otherwise, Reginella insists that two-month-old Mikey is enamored with his bed - and the rest of the youngster's family think the custom-made addition to their household is hilarious. Proud parents: Reginella's childhood friend Mark and his wife (pictured) are thrilled with the custom-made bed . Surprise! Mikey's bed has inspired others to contact Reginella with requests for their own custom designs . RIP Mr Peanut: The designer is thrilled that the publicity surrounding his bed design has caused this image of his beloved cat to be shared around the world . Although he originally intended the bed to be a one-off piece, the response to Reginella's work has been so incredibly positive that he is now taking orders from customers eager for him to create one for their children. And the popularity of his baby bed has also been incredibly positive for Reginella in one other way. The designer's beloved cat Mr Peanut passed away during the first week of January, after being diagnosed with an inoperable tumor. Shortly before his untimely death however, Reginella managed to capture a picture of his feline friend lounging in the Jaws bed, just before he presented it to its new owners and he admits it has been incredibly heartwarming for him to see so many people sharing and commenting on the image. 'On a sad note my friend mr peanut passed today, he had tumor that could not be removed,' Reginella wrote on his Facebook page. 'He is world famous now with his pic in the jaws bed. R.I.P lil man you where a good guy (sic).'","The bed is the work of toy designer sculptor Joseph Reginella, from Staten Island, New York .

"Hotel chain Marriott International has announced that it will no longer block guests' personal Wi-Fi devices after it received a flood of complaints and was fined by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). ‘Marriott International listens to its customers, and we will not block guests from using their personal Wi-Fi devices at any of our managed hotels,’ the company said in a statement posted on its website on Wednesday. In October the FCC fined the Marriott Gaylord Opryland hotel in Nashville, Tennessee, $600,000 for cutting off conventioneers from using their own Wi-Fi, rather than buying the service from the hotel for between $250 and $1,000 per stand. Marriott International has announced that it will no longer block guests' personal Wi-Fi devices after it received a flood of complaints and was fined by the FCC . Marriott had claimed the devices interfered with wireless networks provided on-site and created a potential security risk. ‘The question at hand is what measures a network operator can take to detect and contain rogue and imposter Wi-Fi hotspots used in our meeting and conference spaces that pose a security threat,’ Marriott said earlier this month. The hotel noted it wasn't blocking the devices in guest rooms or lobbies. Tech staff at the Marriott used a monitoring system to de-authenticate guests' personal Wi-Fi hot spots, but the FCC called their actions a violation of federal communications law. Marriott had previously argued that conventions where attendees use their own Wi-Fi hotspots can cause interference with their own network and even a potential security risk . In October the FCC fined the Marriott Gaylord Opryland hotel in Nashville, Tennessee, $600,000 for cutting off conventioneers from using their own Wi-Fi.

The FCC had been considering a petition from Marriott to be allowed to continue blocking Wi-Fi devices in its hotels. Hilton Worldwide and the American Hospitality and Lodging Association, the hotel industry’s lobbying group, had also supported the Marriott’s petition. Technology giants including Google had called Marriott’s the blocking was 'inconsistent with the goals of promoting competition.' ‘We will continue to look to the FCC to clarify appropriate security measures network operators can take to protect customer data, and will continue to work with the industry and others to find appropriate market solutions that do not involve the blocking of Wi-Fi devices,’ Marriott said in its statement on Thursday.","The hotel chain has announced that it will no longer block guests' personal Wi-Fi devices after a flood of complaints .

"A former Utah high school teacher accused of having sex with three underage students is behind bars after a judge ordered her held without bail following the alleged revelation she continued relations with one of the students while awaiting trial. Judge John Morris said at a pre-trial hearing Thursday that Brianne Altice will stand trial for the new charges of rape, unlawful sexual activity and dealing harmful material to a minor in addition to the dozen other felonies she already faced. While authorities and many members of the Davis County community are eager to put Altice away for years, the 35-year-old has a cheerleader in one of her alleged victims. Former Utah school teacher Brianne Altice (right), who's accused of having sex with three underage students, appeared in court Thursday for a preliminary hearing concerning allegations she had sex with one of the original victims after . Brianne Altice listens to the testimony of a teenager who gave details about his sexual relationship when he was 17-years old with Altice, his former Davis High School teacher during a preliminary hearing Thursday . 'She doesn't deserve to be here': The alleged victim did not want to testify against the woman he said he once considered his girlfriend, calling the charges against her 'ridiculous' The young man, now 18, testified against his former teacher Thursday despite being 'very unhappy' about doing so, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. 'It's ridiculous,' he said. 'She doesn't deserve to be here.' He told the court he had sex with Altice once prior to October 2013--when she was initially arrested--and then three more times after that December while she was out on bail. At the conclusion of the hearing, Morris ordered Altice jailed without bail, siding with the prosecution's argument that Altice's 'willingness to continue to commit felony sexual offenses while on bail causes great concern that this defendant will continue and be a danger to the community.' Altice will next see the inside of a courtroom on January 22, when she'll appear for a scheduling hearing. Altice taught English at Davis High School before she was fired last February. Altice was first arrested in October 2013 on suspicion of having sex with a student. Altice is now facing more than a dozen felony counts, including rape and sexual abuse, in two different cases. She has pleaded not guilty to the older charges . Led away: A judge ordered Altice jailed without bail Thursday after hearing testimony that she had sex with a student while out on bail . In August of 2014, a second student came forward accusing Altice of carrying on a physical relationship with him as well. Now, the former educator who lost her job and saw her marriage break apart in the aftermath of the scandal faces felony counts stemming from her alleged encounters with three minors. The charges against Altice include first-degree rape, first-degree forcible sodomy and second-degree forcible sexual abuse. Altice’s attorney, Edward Brass, has said in court his client denies any romantic involvement with the three students. Mounting charges: In this Jan. 3, 2014, file photo, Davis High School English teacher Brianne Altice stands before the judge during her first court hearing in Farmington, Utah . In deep: Brianne Altice, 35, was arrested again last week on four new sex abuse charges and released from jail after posting $10,000 bail, court documents say . ‘It is her defense that they did not happen at all,’ Brass wrote in a motion. ‘That she never engaged in any inappropriate contact with either of her students ...’ Prosecutors said the teacher acknowledged to investigators that she had engaged in sex with the 16-year-old boy on two occasions. The teen was allegedly able to accurately describe the layout of Altice's home to detectives as well as tattoos on her body. But Brass has asked the judge to not allow those statements at her trial, arguing that she was intimidated by the eight to 10 male officers who came to her home last October to interview her about the allegations. Brass argued that the officers would not let her care for children, call an attorney or use the restroom for nearly four hours as they questioned her. Altice faces 10 charges in the earlier case, which involves the 17-year-old and two other students . 'Her statements were coerced and involuntary and were taken in violation of her so-called Miranda rights,' Brass wrote in court papers. 'The evidence she provided was the product of that tainted statement.' In September, one of the teenage boys, now 18, offered graphic details during his testimony about how he went from being Altice's student to allegedly having sex with her in his Farmington home. The teen testified that he was 17-years-old when he became involved with Altice between April and June of 2013, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. He said it began with kissing between class periods and eventually graduated to sexual intercourse. When asked to describe his relationship with Brianne Altice, the teenage boy said she was his 'teacher with benefits.'

"Stan Stanridge (picutred) has accused Abilene schools super Harry Burns of trying to cover up allegations into sex abuse by teachers, and of impeding four of his investigations . A senior Texas police officer has accused a school superintendent of trying to cover up allegations that four teachers had sex with pupils by investigating the crimes himself. Stan Standridge, Abilene Police Chief, said local school superintendent Heath Burns interrogated staff himself before involving police, and has tried to trip up investigators ever since. Mr Standridge also accused Mr Burns of censoring his complaints after he was barred from a school board meeting on Monday, where he planned to discuss his concerns with trustees. Police began their inquiries into the Abilene Independent Schools District in December last year after Michael Trook, 29, the dean of Holland Medical High School, was arrested. Trook has since admitted having sex  with a 17-year-old pupil in his office on December 10 last year and has left his post at the school. On Tuesday this week Breanne Brown, 30, a teacher at Abilene High, was also taken into custody amid allegations she had sex with a 16-year-old pupil on ten separate occasions. However, police  have since alleged that Brown was interviewed  by Mr Burns about her behaviour months before they caught up with her. They say the intervention by Mr Burns shows he was trying to cover up the offences, and did nothing to stop her crimes, as she allegedly carried on her tryst with the student. Cops are investigating two more staff members over claims they were also having sex with students, but have not released any more details. Arrested: Michael Trook, 29 (left), was arrested in December last year amid claims he slept with a student. Police launched probes into three more staff leading to the arrest of Breanne Brown, 30 (right) on Tuesday . At the time of Trook's arrest Mr Burns said he was 'looking forward to working closely with Abilene police' to get to the bottom of the allegations, but relations have since broken down. Tempers first flared in public on December 20 when cops tried to raid two school premises linked to Trook's arrest. Papers filed at the time reveal cops were after a cell phone that allegedly contained pictures of Trook's genitals sent to the victim, and computers on the school campus. However, shortly after the raids Mr Stanridge issued a statement saying his officers had been barred from removing evidence by Mr Burns, and that his investigation was being hampered. Mr Burns strenuously denied these claims, saying he was just trying to follow proper procedure. The argument between the pair came to a head on Monday, when Standridge was denied access to an open meeting of the Abilene Independent Schools District board. He was going to use the meet to discuss concerns with the probes and to update school trustees on progress, but was told he would have to make do with a private meet with Mr Burns instead. Mr Burns attempted to justify the move on legal grounds, but it left Standridge furious. The police chief called a news conference for Tuesday afternoon at which he called out Mr Burns, saying he would be filing a formal complaint over his behaviour. Mr Standridge says Mr Burns interviewed Brown while she was still at Abilene High (pictured) about her alleged crimes in an attempt to cover them up. Cops say she went on to reoffend before they caught her . He said: 'Let me be perfectly clear. I have a personnel complaint related to the performance of Dr. Heath Burns. Instead of involving the police department, he chose to interview the teacher.' That prompted Mr Burns to call his own news conference, saying that he was aware a meeting would have to take place, 'even if it is not on my terms'. However he defended his decision to block Stanridge from Monday's discussion, saying that addressing the board in full open session was not the only way to make a complaint known. Police are continuing their investigations. Since being arrested Brown has resigned from her position at Abilene High.","Police arrested school dean Michael Trook last December amid sex claims .

"A woman has told of her horror at being left deformed and battling life-threatening injuries after a plastic surgeon injected fillers into her face that went disastrously wrong. Alex Laird, 53, from Ireland, bought the Bio-Alcamid filler treatment from a London surgeon eight years ago after seeing an advert online. But a few years later, the chemicals started to move around her face, leaving her with unsightly bumps that quickly became severely infected. Scroll down for video . Alex Laird, 53, from Ireland, had Bio-Alcamid fillers injected into her face. Years later, the chemicals moved around, causing disfigurement and infections. She is sharing her story as a warning . Alex, who works as an accounts administrator, had to be hospitalised twice because the infections were so critical. She has since had the fillers removed by another surgeon and is on the road to recovery, but shared her story on Channel 5's Botched Up Bodies this evening to warn others to do proper research before booking cosmetic procedures. Alex initially bought cheek implants in the 1980s,  in order to make her face look less miserable. She said: 'I used to get complete strangers coming up to me saying ""Oh cheer up"", ""You look so miserable"", ""It's never going to happen"". 'I used to look at people who had lovely big cheekbones and I wanted that. I didn't want to look sad anymore. 'I went to the UK to a particular surgeon. I knew nothing about him or the procedure, I just said I wanted cheek implants in my face.' Alex started cosmtetic surgery in the 1980s when she saw an article in a magazine for cheek implants . Initially, Alex was delighted with the results, but the effect didn't last long. She said: 'After about two months the implants went down to the size of little teaspoons - you could clearly see the outline.' As time went on, she became increasingly unhappy about her appearance again and turned to the internet for a solution. She said: 'When I read about this permanent filler I thought, ""I'm going to get this done. This is finally the answer I've been looking for.""' Alex's family and friends told her that was being ridiculous, but her mind was made up and she flew to London to meet with a surgeon that she found on the internet who said he could do Bio-Alcamid fillers. She said: 'He said to me the filler was completely safe, there were no problems with it, he'd even put some in his own wife. 'He put it all down my jaw, in my cheeks, around my eyes and in my temple area. 'My friends and family were quite shocked at the way I looked, (but) I was really pleased with the results.' Alex used to look at people who had 'lovely big cheekbones' and want them. She didn't want to 'look sad' However, Alex's happiness was not to last. The filler that had once given her confidence and self-assurance started to swell and migrate around her face. With her face now completely deformed, she sought out a doctor in Ireland. She said: 'I'll never forget the look on his face. The first thing he said to me was, ""Did you sue whoever did this to you?"" Now desperate, Alex returned to the surgeon in London who immediately agreed that she needed some of the fillers removed. She said: 'He squeezed some (of it) out, mainly around my temple area, and I remember thinking that it was like a ticking time bomb in my face.' That time bomb was about to explode - with devastating consequences. Soon afterwards, Alex was rushed to hospital with a swollen face from  severe infection. She said: 'I felt overwhelmed with fear.' In a bid to get her botched face fixed, Alex paid a visit to cranial facial surgeon Niall Kirkpatrick, in London. He examined her face and felt for potential danger zones . Although she wanted most of the filler gone, Alex was desperate to be able keep her cheek implants because she was scared that she would be 'left with nothing' if they were removed. The surgeon then booked her in for an MRI scan to help determine exactly where the Bio-Alcamid is, so he could work out how to remove it. Alex left Niall's office pleased she was heading in the right direction, however, just three days later she was rushed to hospital with another life-threatening infection caused by the filler. The filler that had once given her confidence and self-assurance had started to swell and migrate . Now that the filler is all removed, Alex says she feels much less anxious . It was even more severe than her previous infection and she was put on an intravenous drip of antibiotics. This time, it took seven days to bring the bacteria-infected filler that was distorting her face under control. The cosmetic industry's biggest money spinners include laser hair removal, Botox,  fillers. It is an area which is almost entirely unregulated. There are hundreds of fillers available, including Restylane, Juvederm, Radiesse, Sculptra, Bio-Alcamid and Macrolane to name just a few. Bio-Alcamid, a permanent skin filler, was made for the medical industry to replace tissue lost by people suffering from wasting conditions or who have had large tumours removed. It has since been taken up by cosmetic surgeries as a way to plump up the skin. As the name suggests, once a permanent filler is injected, they remain in the body forever. If they move, patients can be left with unsightly lumps or bumps which are difficult to remove. Bad reactions to fillers can cause facial necrosis, disfigurement, nerve damage and anaphylactic shock. Alex said: 'The fact it was happening twice - I never expected that. 'I really didn't expect to get another infection so soon and I think it was actually more scary.' With her health at such risk, it became crucial that the filler was removed before another infection struck. She came back to London to see surgeon Niall for the results of her MRI scan. The news wasn't good - Alex had two implants in each cheek - one on top of the other - and unfortunately they were surrounded by Bio-Alcamid filler, meaning they would have to be removed along with the liquid.

"Heavy snow has turned many areas in Scotland into a real winter wonderland. The white stuff can be seen stretching for miles in this video shot in Stirling, central Scotland. The Met Office has issued an amber ‘be prepared’ alert in central and southern Scotland, with the rest of Britain on yellow 'be aware' alert. Even the most adventurous among us would find hiking around East Biggs somewhat challenging . In this video, the red traffic sign stands out beautifully against the blanket-like landscape, which wouldn't be suitable even for the hardest of hikers. The wintry blast took effect in Scotland yesterday, forcing the closure of more than 30 schools in the Highlands and creating difficult driving conditions. The outline of the traffic sign clashes quite nicely with the blanket-white landscape of snow . The snow has forced the police to urge motorists to avoid dangerous areas and only drive if necessary . Road operator Bear Scotland said its teams were working around the clock to keep routes clear, while Police Scotland said drivers should ask whether their journey is really necessary before getting behind the wheel. Chief Inspector Louise Blakelock said: 'If you do decide to travel, ensure your vehicle is well prepared before setting off, make sure your windscreens are completely free of snow and ice, and your lights are working and clean.' Scholls were closed throughout Scotland as the country continued to experience the cold snap . 'A few reports of cars slipping and at least one jack-knifed lorry. No injuries so far thankfully. Please take care out there.' In the Highlands and Islands 98 schools and nurseries have been shut while eight in Perth and Kinross and five in Shetland have been closed. ScotRail said that no trains would operate from 6pm yesterday until 6pm today on the Helensburgh to Dumbarton Central, Kilwinning to Largs/Ardrossan, Kyle to Dingwall and Glasgow to Fort William/Mallaig/Oban routes.","Snow can be seen stretching for miles in this video shot in Stirling .

"Indonesia has announced that six prisoners will face execution at the weekend while the two Australians on death row will be executed together once their bid for clemency is officially rejected. Bali Nine members Andrew Chan, 31, and Myuran Sukumaran, 33, are among the 20 death row prisoners listed and their schedule for execution could follow. It comes after Sukumaran had his bid for clemency officially rejected, bringing him one step closer to facing the firing squad but Chan has yet to receive notice of his rejection. The Indonesian Attorney-General HM Prasetyo said the pair will be dealt with together. Scroll down for video . The Sydney pair were sentenced to death over a plan to smuggle more than 8kg of heroin to Australia in 2005 . 'When a crime is committed by more than one person the execution must be conducted at the same time,' he told reporters. 'So Myuran will wait for his turn.' When asked if he had been under any pressure from foreign governments including Australia, Prasetyo said: 'so far, none'. Meanwhile, four men and two women, imprisoned in three locations in Java, will be shot by a firing squad, starting on Sunday, the attorney-general said. Among them are foreign drug offenders who are citizens of Malawi, Vietnam and Brazil. The remaining prisoners are two Indonesians and one man of uncertain citizenship who was born in Papua. As plans for the six executions go forward, legal argument continues over how many requests can be filed for an appeal called a judicial review. Two death row prisoners last year requested an additional judicial review. The attorney-general said for the six set for executions, 'All their judicial aspects have been fulfilled'. He didn't know if the two requesting another appeal were in the group. Prasetyo said the executions were in line with President Joko Widodo's determination to crack down on drug crime, which the government claims kill up to 40 Indonesians daily. Bali Nine mastermind Andrew Chan smiles in a holding cell at Denpasar Court after he was sentenced to death for heroin trafficking . Myuran Sukumaran (left, with Andrew Chan) recently had his bid for clemency officially rejected, bringing him one step closer to facing the firing squad . It comes after a spokesman for Indonesia's attorney-general said the list assumes President  Widodo will stick by his pledge to deny mercy to drug smugglers. 'That's what the president said,' Tony Spontana said. 'It's clear and so we're confident.' Sukumaran learned his last-ditch appeal had been formally rejected last week. Chan and Sukumaran's pleas for clemency were made more than two years ago, amid an unofficial moratorium on the use of the death penalty in Indonesia. But hopes dimmed when Mr Joko declared he was against clemency for drug offenders late last year. Five or six convicts are to be executed imminently, and the 20 others will follow. The letter informing Sukumaran that his bid had failed said: 'there's not enough reason to give clemency to the convicted'. Chan's name is on the list of prisoners scheduled for execution this year, even though a letter rejecting his bid for presidential clemency has yet to be issued . However both men have made huge efforts in their rehabilitation, and help other inmates through art, cooking and mentoring programs. In a message on his supporters' Facebook page on Tuesday, Chan said he was humbled by the birthday wishes he received. 'I am standing strong - we are standing strong,' he wrote. 'We are trusting that the Indonesian president will see that the work we are doing and the work we want to do will make a positive difference in rehabilitating people here and in other places too.' Sukumaran's (centre) claim for clemency has been rejected in line with President Joko Widodo's stance . The attorney-general said Chan (centre) and Sukumaran will be dealt together once he receives his rejection . Chan dreams of teaching hospitality classes and Sukumaran has more plans for his art. 'We are, with your encouragement, able to keep on doing that even in the current situation,' Chan wrote. A potential new appeal avenue hinges on an argument between Indonesia's constitutional and supreme courts over how many times prisoners can seek judicial reviews. The newly-appointed head of the constitutional court, Arief Hidayat, told the Koran Tempo newspaper the president should meet senior judges to sort out the wrangle. He maintains his court's decision allowing multiple reviews should be applied uniformly. 'When the constitutional court has made a decision, it can't be interpreted any further,' he said. The Sydney pair were sentenced to death over a plan to smuggle more than 8kg of heroin to Australia in 2005.","Indonesia will execute six death row prisoners, starting on Sunday .

"Barry Dyson, 39, was jailed for 16 weeks today for using a mirror to look up women's skirts in shops . An accountant who used a mirror to peep up women's skirts while they shopped is the first person in the UK to be banned from carrying any reflective object in public. Barry Dyson, 39, sneaked up behind five unsuspecting women in Harvey Nichols and Selfridges and used a mirror to look up their skirts at their 'knickers and buttocks'. When quizzed by security staff, he admitted he had gone to the stores to do Christmas shopping and 'peek up women's skirts'. The serial offender was today jailed for up to 16 weeks at Manchester magistrates' court. Jailing him, District Judge Jonathan Feinstein said: 'I hope this is a big shock to you. Having been given opportunities you still resorted to this type of wholly unacceptable, insidious and disrespectful behaviour.' He went on to say the women didn't know they were being spied on which made the case 'even more sinister'. As well as the ban on carrying any reflective item in public, Dyson must surrender any recording device in his possession if asked to do so by the police. He must also pay an £80 victim surcharge. Dyson, from Horwich, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, was spotted acting suspiciously in Harvey Nicholls in Manchester city centre on November 30 last year. Security staff initially suspected him of stealing until they saw him take a mirror from his rucksack and go behind two females. When he was approached, he said he had gone to the store 'to do Christmas shopping and peek up women's skirts', before telling police 'it turned me on'. Dyson was spotted acting suspiciously in Harvey Nichols in Manchester (pictured) on November 30 last year . Dyson, 39, also crouched behind women in Selfridges in Manchester and used a mirror to look up their skirts . Manchester magistrates' court was also told it was not the first time Dyson had been caught indulging in warped behaviour. The court was told that he had been convicted of similar offences in 2009 and given a five-year-anti-social behaviour order. He was also convicted under the public order act in 2004 and 2005 for offences of a like nature. Prosecuting, Tess Kenyon said: 'He wandered from shop to shop and on each occasion crouched down behind a female shopping and held a mirror under her skirt in order to see the image of her knickers and buttocks. 'He was arrested and he accepted there would be video on his phone of similar acts. He had downloaded them and it wasn't footage of him.' In mitigation, Andrew Fitch-Holland said: 'When he was arrested in Harvey Nicholls he was taken to the police station where he made full admissions to the offence but then on his own volition explained that he had been in other shops. 'In fact each admission went beyond the offence for which he was detained. His previous offending behaviour is a matter of grave concern. He recognises his particular predilection is disgraceful, distressing and wholly inappropriate.' Mr Fitch-Holland said Dyson blamed his latest lapse on problems at work, his snooker team folding and a family bereavement. Sentencing, District Judge Fernstein added: 'It is something which in a way undermines the position of these women and is distasteful beyond belief. You have had opportunities to get help and treatment. 'When you are confronted with difficulties you resort back to this behaviour. Whatever difficulties you have there is no excuse for this type of behaviour. For women not knowing anything going on to be violated in this way is unacceptable. You have had opportunities to sort this out and you have done it again.'","Barry Dyson lurked behind women and used mirror to look up their skirts .

"Astronomers believe there are at least two unknown planets waiting to be discovered well beyond Pluto. They claim these planets are changing the position of objects away from Neptune, causing them to behave in strange ways. If their theory proves true, scientists say it could 'revolutionise' solar system models. Scientists say at least two planets could exist in our solar system beyond Pluto (artist's impression pictured) Astronomers have spent decades debating whether hidden Plutonian planet remains to be discovered within the solar system. Scientists at the Complutense University of Madrid and the University of Cambridge say there must be at least two planets to explain the orbital behaviour of extreme trans-Neptunian objects. These objects, known as ETNOs, describe minor worlds such as Pluto that orbit the sun at a greater average distance than Neptune. The most accepted theory says that the orbits of these objects, which travel beyond Neptune, should be distributed randomly. They should also fulfil a series of characteristics such as have an inclination of almost 0° and an or angle of perihelion – which is their closest point of the orbit to our sun - close to 0° or 180°. Last year two researchers from the US discovered a dwarf planet called 2012 VP113 in the Oort cloud, just beyond our solar system.  Each one of these images was taken about two hours apart . A trans-Neptunian object is any minor planet in the solar system that orbits the sun at a greater distance on average than Neptune. The largest known trans-Neptunian objects are Pluto and Eris. These are followed by Makemake and Haumea . Yet what is observed in a dozen of these bodies is quite different: the average inclination of their orbit is around 20° and angle of perihelion –31°. 'This excess of objects with unexpected orbital parameters makes us believe that some invisible forces are altering the distribution of the orbital elements of the ETNO,' said Carlos de la Fuente Marcos, a scientist at the UCM and co-author of the study. A trans-Neptunian object is any minor planet in the solar system that orbits the sun at a greater distance on average than Neptune. Pluto was the first trans-Neptunian object to be discovered in 1930. Then, more than 60 years later, astronomers found a second trans-Neptunian object, (15760) 1992 QB1. Since then however, over 1,000 trans-Neptunian objects have been discovered. The largest known trans-Neptunian objects are Pluto and Eris. These are followed by Makemake and Haumea. 'We consider that the most probable explanation is that other unknown planets exist beyond Neptune and Pluto.' 'The exact number is uncertain, given that the data that we have is limited, but our calculations suggest that there are at least two planets, and probably more, within the confines of our solar system,' adds the astrophysicist. Their theory goes against the predictions of current models on the formation of the solar system, which state that there are no other planets moving in circular orbits beyond Neptune. But, the recent discovery by the Alma radio telescope of a planet-forming disk more than 100 astronomical units from the star HL Tauri, suggests that planets can form several hundred astronomical units away from the centre of the system. Last year two researchers from the US discovered a dwarf planet called 2012 VP113 in the Oort cloud, just beyond our solar system. They believe that its orbit is influenced by the possible presence of a dark and icy super-Earth, up to ten times larger than our planet. The recent discovery by the Alma radio telescope of a planet-forming disk more than 100 astronomical units from the star HL Tauri, suggests that planets can form several hundred astronomical units away from the centre of the system.","Astronomers noticed objects beyond Neptune were behaving strangely .

"Brothers of the University of Virginia fraternity at the center of a now discredited Rolling Stone article about gang rape have spoken out for the first time to detail how they were forced into hiding after the story incited mass protests on campus. The article about the issue of sexual assault at UVA starts with the horrifying account of one student who claims to have been gang-raped by seven men in an apparent initiation ritual at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity two years ago. But after several holes in the victim's story were brought to light, and a police investigation found no evidence the crime ever happened, the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity was taken off suspension this week and are set to start their new remember recruitment - known as Rush - tonight. Phi Psi president Stephen Scipione, a 21-year-old junior from Richmond, Virginia, spoke with the Washington Post and described the night in November when he and his brothers huddled around and read the damning article. Breaking their silence: Phi Kappa Psi President Stephen Scipione, left, and fraternity brother David Fontenot, right, spoke out this week to detail how their fraternity responded to the allegations in the now-discredited Rolling Stone article which named the house as the location of a gang rape in fall 2012 . Afraid: The brothers say they were forced to check into hotel rooms when their house on the Charlottesville campus became the center of mass protests . 'Some people actually had to leave the room while they were reading it because they were so upset,' Scipione said. Details of the story were so distressing and cruel that it sparked mass protests on campus, with many calling for the end of all Greek Life. All fraternities and sororities were suspended for the rest of the semester while  the university and local police investigated. Just hours after the story came out, the Phi Psi house was gratified with statements like 'UVA Center for Rape Studies' and 'Suspend Us!' and the brothers say bricks were thrown through the windows. Anonymous: The UVA junior who accused the fraternity of gang rape, identified as Jackie, has had her story discredited in several reports . Fearing their safety, most of them fled the house, booking hotel rooms. Rumors of the Rolling Stone article started in September, when an executive from the nationals office was dispatched to the campus to question them about a story line the reporter chasing surrounding an incident at the fraternity in the fall of 2012. 'He basically asked if, one, we knew about [the allegations] and, two, if we had committed it,' said Scipione. 'The look around the table was complete shock and awe.' Reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely sent Scipione an email with three questions before publishing the article, but would not say when the alleged gang rape happened or reveal any other details that would help him give her a detailed answer. The reaction after reading the article when it was finally published, was shock and then confusion. Details of the article didn't add up to the brothers who were members of the fraternity when the alleged incident happened. 'We knew that the Rolling Stone story was not true,' said David Fontenot, 22, a senior from McLean, Virginia. The brothers checked old emails, bank accounts and other fraternity records and discovered that they did not hold a party at the house the weekend of September 28, 2012 - and that no one in their fraternity matched the description of the primary attacker, a junior who worked at the university pool. They also staunchly denied the suggestion that the incident was an initiation ritual for new members, as details of the attack suggested. 'We vehemently deny that it would be plausible as a ritualistic tradition to join our fraternity,' Scipione said. Vilified: Above, some of the gratified that tagged the house after the rolling Stone article was published in November . 'it's animalistic and totally unrealistic,' Fontenot added. The brothers decided not to announce these revelations immediately, holding off until December to issue a statement that marked the quick unraveling of the victim's claims. While they insist they are not the real 'victims' of the story, the brothers don't believe it was right that they were all automatically condemned as rapists with the publishing of the story. 'That leads back to the bigger problem in that our society tends to rush to judge without the facts,' Scipione said. 'They just see the headline and get upset, and they want to blame it on someone, and obviously we were the easiest targets for that.' Since the article was published, Phi Psi members have undergone sexual assault seminars and were the first fraternity to sign a new  university policy about parties at Greek life parties. The new rules were developed to protect revelers from being slipped date rape drugs in their drinks. All fraternities must sign the pact by January 16, and two are holding out so far - saying they are being blamed for the campus' bad press.","The Phi Kappa Psi fraternity was allowed to return to campus this week after a police investigation found no evidence of the alleged gang rape .

"Decision: The 23-year-old received an 'awkward' phone call from a senior executive who said it would be an issue for her to come back to the office because 'just about everyone had seen me half-naked online' An intern at a top Wall Street asset management firm has quit so she can pursue a career in porn. Paige A. Jennings, who moonlights under the name Veronica Vain, left Lazard Asset Management last week after co-workers saw nude selfies she took in the office bathroom  online. The 23-year-old then received an 'awkward' phone call from a senior executive who said it would be an issue for her to come back to the New York because 'just about everyone had seen me half-naked online'. According to Business Insider, in June she started as a part-time intern in alternative-investments marketing at the group in Manhattan. The Florida University graduate insisted that when the selfies surfaced, she was not fired and left her position willingly. She is to believed to have already handed in her two weeks notice when she started sneakily taking pictures in the toilets. Her Twitter description reads: 'I just left a job on Wall Street for a porn career because I can't stop masturbating at work.' Yesterday she added: 'I left finance because if I'm going to take it ** *** *** for a decade, I'd prefer to get in to a hall of fame for it.' Jennings is now looking to kick start her career and has made it into the final casting of the X-rated Internet reality show, 'The Sex Factor.' The porn competition which is set in Las Vegas and will be aired globally is scheduled to be hosted by Duke University porn star Belle Knox. In an interview with Bro Bible, she said she did not expect her colleagues to see the explicit images because they were not attached to her name. She said: 'Few people close to me knew what I was up to, but I firmly disbelieve they said anything, so I honestly have no idea how they came across it. So many people found out so fast, it is taking me for quite the spin. On her decision to chose a new career path, she said: 'Intellectually speaking, I love financial analysis and thinking.

"We might wring our hands and roll our eyes at endless health and safety rules. But it seems that when there’s a job to get on with, there are still plenty left in Britain who don’t mind a bit of old-fashioned make do and mend. Caught on camera by shocked passers-by, this lot haven’t let a lack of proper equipment stand in their way. One horrified onlooker caught a car passenger precariously holding a ladder in place through a car window on a busy dual carriageway while travelling at 50mph. Scroll down for video . The man was spotted on Tuesday clinging on to the metal ladder with his outstretched arm (pictured) as he travelled along the busy A666 dual carriageway in Bolton, Lancashire - which has a 50mph speed limit . A man was spotted sitting in the back of a blue Nissan, clinging on to the metal steps with his outstretched arm as he travelled on the major road. Passing motorists said they could not believe what they were seeing as they witnessed the potentially catastrophic scene. Builder Steve Wignall, who caught the antics on camera, said: 'Okay, it looks funny but I was a bit annoyed. 'I've got two young kiddies and there's a potential for a really bad road traffic accident. 'It's not what you expect to see on the dual carriageway coming out of Bolton.' The incident took place on Tuesday morning on the A666 in Bolton, Lancashire. Another man was driving the car. This picture shows how the ladder was balanced on the man's arm which is poking out of the back window . The speed limit on the busy road, which runs between Salford and Langho is 50mph. Father-of-two Mr Wignall has run his own construction business for two years and has been in the building trade for 20 years and is well aware of the strict health and safety rules in place to protect himself, workers and others. He added: 'You would normally put them [ladders] in a van but it wasn't big enough. 'There are roof bars you can use that are specifically for ladders. 'Hopefully the driver will read all about his stupid antics and think twice before doing it again.' Of course, in the interest of public safety, this sort of behaviour does tend to land you in hot water - if you are caught. Another incident which emerged yesterday saw two men heavily fined after they tried to fix a 30ft street light with a precarious DIY crane - made from a forklift truck and some pallets. Costly: Builders Jonathan Shaw, 44, and Stephen Fawcett, 69, were fined £8,000 each for this escapade . Jonathan Shaw, 44, and Stephen Fawcett, 69, were reported to the council by a passer-by who snapped a shot of the pair’s forklift antics. Fawcett was standing on a metal cage designed to be attached to the truck and had no harness or safety equipment to prevent him from falling. There were also no preventative measures in place on the ground to stop people from coming within dangerous distance of the machinery. The escapade in Morecambe earned them each an £8,000 fine, with Lancaster Magistrates’ Court condemning the arrangement as at best ‘precarious’ and at worst ‘reckless’. And builder Steve Wignall, who spotted the ladder winding its way towards Bolton, said he was ‘shocked’ by the sight, although he did end up conceding: ‘It was a bit funny.’","Shocking image shows passenger clinging on to ladder out of car window .

"When it was launched, it seemed little more than a pipe dream. Now, Billionaire inventor Elon Musk has revealed he plans to build a test track for Hyperloop, a futuristic plan for a new type of transport that would shoot capsules of passengers along a tube at around the speed of sound. Musk, one of the brains behind the online payment system PayPal, and SpaceX claims his solar-powered 'Hyperloop' could herald a revolution in travel - and is building the test facility to prove it. The Hyperloop Transportation Technologies design for Elon Musk's Hyperloop. It hopes to produce a technical feasibility study finished in mid-2015. The team believes the system could link the majority of America's major cities together. Scroll down for video . Inside the tubes, hyperloop pods are mounted on thin skis . made out of inconel,an alloy already used by Musk's SpaceX firm that can . withstand high pressure and heat. Air is pumped into the skis via small holes to make an . air cushion, and each pod has air inlets at the front. An electric turbo compressor compresses air from the nose . and routes it to the skis and to the cabin. Magnets on the skis, plus an electromagnetic pulse give . the pod its initial thrust; reboosting motors along the route would keep the . pod moving at just below the speed of sound so the system does not produce . sonic booms. He believes it would take just 30 minutes to travel the 381 miles from Los Angeles to San Francisco – half the time it takes in a plane – and likened the passenger experience to Disneyland's rocket ride Space Mountain. Now, the plans are beginning to take shape. 'Will be building a Hyperloop test track for companies and student teams to test out their pods. Most likely in Texas,' Musk tweeted. A new firm, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, is developing plans to makes the tubes a reality - and it has recruited experts from around the world. The crowdsourced firm has around 100 engineers on the projects, and nearly all of them have day jobs at companies like Boeing, NASA, Yahoo!, Airbus, SpaceX, and Salesforce. Dirk Ahlborn, the CEO of the new company, says it seemed the perfect way to develop the plans, with a site called JumpStartFund that aimed to crowdsource ideas. He got in touch with SpaceX, Musk's firm, and the work began. The team includes about 25 UCLA graduate architecture students at a facility in Playa Vista, although most members work remotely. Ahlborn hopes to have a technical feasibility study finished in mid-2015, according to Wired. So far, the team has made progress in three main areas: the capsules, the stations, and the route. 'They look at this like a blank sheet of paper on which they can realize their fantasies,' UCLA professor Craig Hodgetts said. Musk's idea is based on the pneumatic tubes that fire capsules of paperwork between floors in offices. In this case, the capsules would carry people – even cars – in low-pressure tubes to minimise turbulence and maximise speed. Musk believes it would take just 30 minutes to travel the 381 miles from Los Angeles to San Francisco – half the time it takes in a plane – and likened the passenger experience to Disneyland's rocket ride Space Mountain. On top of pylons is a hovering capsule inside a low-pressurized tube, which can reach speeds of up to 760 mph. 'The only resistance would be the air in front of the capsule, which we moved to the back by using a compressor,' Hyperloop CEO Dirk Ahlborn said. At its launch, Musk described the Hyperloop design as looking like a shotgun, with the tubes running side-by-side for most of the journey, then closing at either end to form a loop. Trains of capsules would shoot through the almost air-free tube at up to 760mph, . accelerated by magnets which would also keep each pod on a steady course. Each capsule would float on a cushion of air it creates as it speeds along – similar to an air hockey table. So far, the team has made progress in three main areas: the capsules, the stations, and the route. The proposed route of the firstHyperloop follows Interstate 5, which runs through the agriculture-richCentral Valley in California. It would take seven to ten years to build. Capsules carrying six to eight people would depart every 30 seconds, with tickets costing around £13 each way. In his proposal released . online, Musk wrote: 'Short of figuring out real teleportation, which . would of course be awesome (someone please do this), the only option for . super-fast travel is to build a tube over or under the ground that . contains a special environment.' The proposed route of the first . Hyperloop follows Interstate 5, which runs through the agriculture-rich . Central Valley in California. It would take seven to ten years to build. Musk put the price tag at around . £4billion but pointed out that that is around one-tenth of the projected . cost of a high-speed rail system that California has been planning to . build. The 100 person team is spread around the world . The tyeam has even built models in their bid to find out if Hyperloop could actually work . However, transport experts received . the proposal with scepticism, citing barriers, such as the threat of . earthquakes in the region. Musk has said he is too focused on other . projects, for example his rocket building company SpaceX, to consider . building the Hyperloop, and instead is publishing a design that anyone . can use or modify. Musk said he started thinking about the idea when plans for a 130mph (210km/h) high-speed train connection between LA and San Francisco were revealed, but now he has detailed his own version on Tesla's site. 'Flight' of the future: The hyperloop will travel the distance between Los Angeles and San Francisco in only 30 minutes . Smooth ride: 'It would have less lateral acceleration which is what tends to make people feel motion sick than a subway ride, as the pod banks against the tube like an airplane,' creator Elon Musk said . 'I originally started thinking about [Hyperloop] when I read about California's high-speed rail project which was somewhat disappointing,' he told a Google Hangout with Richard Branson last week. 'It's actually worse than taking the plane. I get a little sad when things are not getting better in the future. 'Another example would be like the Concorde being retired and the fact there is no supersonic passenger transport. I think that is sad. You want the future to be better than the past, or at least I do.' The entrepreneur made his fortune with the internet payment system PayPal before switching his skills into developing the new Falcon rocket system for Nasa and the Tesla electric car. Mr Musk claims Hyperloop would be a practical solution for city pairs separated by 1,000 miles (1,600km) or less. Beyond this distance, it would be better to take a plane, he explained. Unique: Travellers would enter aluminium pods which are mounted above the ground on columns 50 to 100 yards apart . Modern: This image shows how people would travel in the pods . But for the shorter distance, his new concept would beat the plane, he argues, because it would not waste time ascending and descending. 'You want a transport system that is roughly twice as fast as the next best alternative, that costs less, that is safer, that is not subject to weather and is more convenient,' Mr Musk said. 'If there were such a thing, I think most people would take it. In fact, it would increase the travel between the city pairs because of the increased convenience.' Experts say Musk's track record could help the plan become a reality. 'Hyperloop is quite an old science fiction idea but Elon Musk is the sort of man who could make it work,' said physicist Martin Archer from Imperial College London. Space-like: This conceptual design of the machine shows that it will have a futuristic look . Built to last: The inventor boasted that the tracks would be immune to weather and earthquakes, though it is not immediately clear how so . Creature comforts: The legroom is said to give would-be passengers a disruption-free ride . 'He's the guy who made electric cars go fast with Tesla, which many people didn't think would be possible; and he's the head of SpaceX which is the only commercial rocket builder that has managed to hook up with the International Space Station.' Musk says he will leave it to others to build the system initially. 'I have to focus on core Tesla business and SpaceX business, and that's more than enough,' he told investors of Tesla, his electric car firm. 'If nothing happens for a few years, with that I mean maybe it could make sense to make the halfway path with Tesla involvement,' Musk said. 'Hyperloop consists of a low pressure tube with capsules that are transported at both low and high speeds throughout the length of the tube,' Musk said in an exhaustive paper detailing the system posted online. 'The capsules are supported on a cushion of air.' Each of the capsules is pressurized, . and Musk says they have an emergency braking system as well as a reserve . air supply in the event of an emergency. Appealing to environmentalists: This graph shows the energy cost per passenger on different modes of transportation for the specific San Francisco-Los Angeles journey . There and back: The 'loop' portion highlights the fact that there would only be two stops . He admits the scheme came from a disdain for current systems. 'When the California 'high speed' rail was approved, I was quite disappointed, as I know many others were too. 'How . could it be that the home of Silicon Valley and JPL – doing incredible . things like indexing all the world's knowledge and putting rovers on . Mars – would build a bullet train that is both one of the most expensive . per mile and one of the slowest in the world?' Musk claims the scheme can power itself through solar energy. 'By placing solar panels on top of the tube, the Hyperloop can generate far in excess of the energy needed to operate. 'This . takes into account storing enough energy in battery packs to operate at . night and for periods of extended cloudy weather', he claims.","Musk is working with UCLA researchers to develop system .

"Children born within the next generation will live for 100 years on average, according to newly released statistics. As life expectancy across Britain increases, current projections place female babies born as soon as 2057 to  reach 100 years old - a remarkable milestone once previously thought impossible. The study, published today by the Office for National Statistics, reveals that the average life expectancy has increased in the past 35 years by about seven years. Girls born in the year 2057 will have an average life expectancy of 100 years, a new study has revealed. File image used . If these increases continue, a boy born in the UK in 2057 has an average life expectancy of 97.3 years, while the figure for girls born in the same year will be 100. The projections were revealed in a newly report that analysed the size and characteristics of Britain's population. Such data provides valuable insight for the future, enabling lawmakers to better plan services such as transport infrastructure and healthcare. High levels of migration and an increase in the number of births have also contributed to Britain's swelling population, the researchers found. In its analysis, researchers stated: 'With life expectancy increasing, the UK’s population will age. 'This will affect a number of policy areas, including pensions and the health service – particularly because healthy life expectancy is not increasing as quickly.'","The average life expectancy has steadily increased in past three decades .

"Most British adults are convinced the world is getting worse because our happiest recollections are formed between the ages of 15 and 25, a new study has revealed. Despite longer life expectancy, improved living conditions and better technology, 70 per cent of Brits believe the world is decline, with a further 55 per cent of people saying that their own lives are getting worse. However, psychologists say that people's minds could be playing tricks on them by making them focus on current global dilemmas such as terrorism, war and negative events in their personal lives. Psychologists say that as our happiest and strongest recollections are formed between the ages of 15 and 25, it distorts people's view of the present day (file picture) They add this is due to a 'memory bump' as our strongest recollections are between the ages of 15 and 25, which distorts out view of the present. The survey was carried out for the BBC Radio Four series, The Human Zoo, which reports that by only remembering good things from the past, people fear that the future can only get worse. Professor Nick Chater from Warwick Business School, who features on the new series, says many people look at the past through rose-tinted glasses. He explained: 'The idea that everything is getting worse - declinism - is an old one, even ancient Athens saw itself as having declined from a former, mythical golden age. 'In particular our memory tends to forget about the bad events in our past and we have a tendency to rehearse and dwell on the good things that happened in the past. The new study for the Human Zoo series on Radio 4 revealed 70 per cent of Brits believe the world is decline (file picture) 'We retell them a lot more often, so we reinforce the good memories. 'We tend to remember the great songs or cars or football players from the ""old days"" and forget all the bad ones.' As part of the survey, researchers carried out an experiment where they asked people to rate their holidays as they experienced them and then again several months later. The study found that all the ratings were higher when the travellers recollected their experiences compared to what they said while on the holiday. Professor Chater, who is also an advisor on behavioural change for the government, added: 'The key point is that people rate past holidays - and other experiences - as much more positive in retrospect than they do at the time. 'This is an illustration of the general idea that my life now doesn't seem as good as it will look in retrospect. 'This leads to status quo bias, which asserts that whatever the situation is now, things in the future will get worse. 'This plus loss aversion, combined with our memory's tendency to filter out bad experiences from the past, can leave us seeing the world, and our lives, as getting worse.'","New survey reveals 70 per cent of Brits believe that the world is in decline .

"Britain was handing out around £60million a day in foreign aid towards the end of the year in order to meet David Cameron's target, a report has found. Taxpayers funded £11.5billion of overseas development projects in 2013 – the first time the Coalition's aim to hand out 0.7pc of GDP to developing countries has been achieved. But a report has found this involved a major effort by civil servants at the Department for International Development (DfID), who had to increase their spending by a third compared with the previous year. Taxpayers handed out £60million per day for overseas development projects towards the end of 2013 to meet David Cameron's target . In November and December of that year alone, they had to spent more than £3.7billlion in a last ditch attempt to meet the target – which works out at around £60million every day for those two months. The National Audit Office, which scrutinises government spending, warn that the strict target could leave civil servants 'feeling pressure' to hand out money to projects which are not needed. In a report published today, they explain that a shortfall towards the end of the year 'constrained choice' and meant officials 'could only choose activities where funds could be paid out during 2013'. 'It may therefore have missed opportunities to get the best outcomes from this spending', they said. DfID did significant preparation work to deal with the increased budget, boosting its workforce, business processes and the ways in which it measures the benefits of aid, the report found. In the end, money which was intended to be given to international aid organisations in early 2014 for long-term projects was able to be brought forward and this was within the rules. The report found there was a major effort by DfID officials, under International Development Secretary Justine Greening (pictured), to increase their spending . But the authors said: 'The need to hit a hard calendar year spending target could increase the risk of staff feeling pressure at year end to payments which are in advance of need. 'The reasons for such payments should be properly documented and authorised. If payments are in advance of need, they are irregular and contrary to HM Treasury rules'. In 2014 there was also a rush to spending £12billion by the end of year, with a last minute rise required when the economy grew faster than expected. A DFID spokesman said: 'In 2013 the UK became the first G7 country to meet the UN target to spend 0.7 per cent of GNI on ODA. 'Investing in overseas development is creating a world that is healthier, more stable and increasingly prosperous and that is something Britain can be proud of. UK aid goes only where it is most needed and where it will deliver the very best results for taxpayers' money. 'Using available GNI estimates, DFID sets a clear strategy each year to deliver its ODA target and works with HMT to monitor and manage this through the year. It is normal practice and good financial management for organisations to take stock of priorities and emerging pressure through the year. 'The nature of issues that DFID deals with, including humanitarian emergencies, means it is important to retain this flexibility.'","Taxpayers funded £11.5billion of overseas development projects in 2013 .

"Southwest Airlines has landed an historic $1.6 million fine for keeping 16 Chicago flights on the tarmac for more than three hours. Staffing shortages and a bad winter storm meant hundreds of passengers who flew into Midway Airport on January 2 last year were left in their seats for longer than federal regulations allow - some for more than four hours. 'We are disappointed that the government would seek additional money,' Southwest said in a statement, 'after the enormous penalties imposed on Southwest by Mother Nature during the January 2014 winter storms.' But the Department of Transportation (DOT) refused to accept the excuses and ordered the airline to pay $1.6 million.

The bill includes a $600,000 payment to the government and $269,000 in compensation to passengers. It is the first time the DOT has ever fined Southwest. 'Airline passengers have rights, and the department's tarmac delay rules are meant to prevent passengers from being stuck on an aircraft on the ground for hours on end,' Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said. The calamity was caused by issues with Southwest's staff scheduling system, which meant they were understaffed. The winter storm Hercules impacted problems, with subzero temperatures and heavy snow. Landmark ruling: The Department for Transportation said the storm and staff shortages were not an excuse . But DOT regulations dictate that no flight should remain on the tarmac longer than three hours after landing.

"Almost 140,000 people have signed a petition demanding that retailer John Lewis pay its cleaners a living wage of £7.85 an hour. Despite the John Lewis Partnership - which made a £424million profit last year - offering competitive benefits and a bonus scheme, cleaners are employed by an external contractor and are not paid the same as staff at the company's stores. Last month MailOnline reported that protesters supporting the petition were arrested as they took part in a demonstration at the flagship John Lewis store in London. Scroll down for video . Almost 140,000 people have signed a petition on Change.org (pictured) which is demanding that John Lewis pay its cleaners a living wage of £7.85 an hour - well above the UK minimum wage of £6.50 . The protest was part of an on-going campaign by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), who want the cleaners to receive the same benefits as John Lewis Partnership staff. IWGB argue that the Living Wage is £7.85 in the UK and £9.15 in London - in comparison to the actual minimum wage of £6.50. The petition, on website Change.org, states: ‘John Lewis brands itself as a company that is committed to treating its suppliers, customers and partners with fairness. ‘But it has contracted out its cleaning services. Its cleaners receive less than the living wage and are not entitled to the bonus payments paid to directly employed staff. ‘Given John Lewis’s impressive profit levels, it is very troubling that it refuses to show moral leadership and pay its cleaners the living wage.’ The company's flagship John Lewis store on Oxford Street, London, which was the scene of a heated protest last month - campaigners supporting the petition stormed the shop and demanded fair pay for cleaners . Jane Lambert, a John Lewis customer, set up the petition after reading an article which said that despite recording impressive profit levels, the company did not pay cleaners a living wage. She told MailOnline today: ‘I was hoping there would be a good response, and there has been. ‘We’ve had 10,000 new signatures over the last week or so, so momentum is growing. ‘We are next hoping to set up a network of local groups to raise the profile of the petition. ‘I think the petition is potentially quite a powerful weapon because it’s a good way or communicating and it does put pressure on John Lewis. ‘They pride themselves on being ethical and fair retailers and this does not fit with that ethic really. ‘Talking to customers coming out of the store, most customers were not aware that John Lewis does not pay a living wage and were quite shocked. 'I think if we are able to raise the profile of the petition and get a lot more signatures, that can only help in terms of putting pressure on John Lewis.’ The group also want cleaners to be included in the partnership's annual bonus scheme and given the same rights as other workers. The John Lewis Partnership, which employs around 90,000 people, says while it believes in fair pay, it cannot enforce pay levels well above market rates on the contractors it uses. John Lewis Partnership is owned by a trust on behalf of all its employees, who are known as partners. It runs the John Lewis department stores as well as Waitrose supermarkets. Partners have a say in how the company is run, as well as a share of the annual profits through a bonus scheme. It is one of the largest private companies in the UK. Last year partners received a bonus of 15 per cent of their annual salary- equivalent to almost eight weeks' pay. John Lewis Partnership employs around 90,000 people.Cleaners are employed by an external contractor but IWGB Union wants them to receive the same benefits as John Lewis partnership staff. John Lewis spokesman Neil Spring said: 'We share the Living Wage campaign’s objectives to pay employees fairly, but we also think that outsourcing is a perfectly legitimate business function; that pay is rightly a core responsibility of the individual employer; and that the issue of low pay in the UK and the solution, is much more complex than raising a higher wage floor. 'Within the Partnership, our policy is to pay the market rate for a job and as much above that as can be justified by performance. 'Our pay ranges typically extend further than those in many of our competitors. 'On top of that our Partners receive a share of our profits as well as other benefits such as a final salary pension. 'We don’t believe it is appropriate, therefore, for us to set pay rates well above market levels for subcontractors or suppliers, particularly as it would be inconsistent with the broader pay and reward policy we adopt for 90,000 of our own Partners.' In December police were called after a group of chanting protesters descended on the John Lewis Oxford Street store in London. The incident took place as dozens of customers were doing their Christmas shopping on one of the busiest weekends of the year. At least one protester was bundled to the floor as officers tried to contain demonstrators and get them to leave the busy shop. The flagship branch of John Lewis in Oxford Street, London, which protesters stormed in December . One shopper, who did not want to be named, said: 'It's bad enough shopping in Oxford Street two Saturdays before Christmas without a load of idiots coming between you and the kitchenware section. 'It was absolutely packed in there and so when they started shouting I think the staff panicked a bit and then before we knew it there a load of police officers descended on the place. 'They were trying to get them to leave but the protesters were having none of it.' Some demonstrators were seen hanging banners over the railings which said: 'Justice for the Cleaners' and going down the escalators blowing horns. Other campaigners were seen holding boards which said: 'John Lewis your customers say pay your cleaners the living wage.'","Petition is campaigning for cleaners at company to be paid the living wage .

"Distraught: Liz Lowther, pictured, said she was reduced to tears by the string of threatening letters from Virgin Media to her late husband, James . A widow was left so distraught by threatening letters sent by Virgin Media to her late husband that she wrote to company founder Richard Branson. Liz Lowther said that she wrote to the company after her husband's death last March, explaining that she was handling his affairs and asking them to transfer the account into her name. But she was reduced to tears after Virgin Media continued to send notices addressed to James. Mrs Lowther, from Hitchin, Hertfordshire, said Virgin had sent a number of letters requesting that she return a 'multi-media hub' - used to connect to the internet - and warned that she faced a £150 bill if she failed to do so. The 70-year-old said that her problems began after she wrote the the company following her husband's death. 'I have had numerous letters still addressed to James,' she said. 'To lose my beloved husband was terrible. But it's been made much worse by Virgin repeatedly sending letters to me in his name.' 'That's despite me sending them at least 12 letters and making around the same number of phone calls. Virgin Media have shown a complete lack of compassion.' She said that she grew so desperate that she even wrote to Richard Branson, but had received to response. 'He's probably just sitting on his island,' she said. 'Maybe Richard Branson should spend less time staring at the stars and more time dealing with customers here on earth.' In December, she wrote again to the company to give notice that she no longer wished to stayed with them because of their behaviour. But on Saturday, another letter addressed to her husband arrived, requesting the hub. Mrs Lowther said: 'I am 70 and my friends are horrified at what has happened since my dear husband passed away. I am still waiting for a written apology. 'I am not asking for compensation as I don't need it but it would be nice to get some sort of recognition from Virgin as they have caused me such distress. 'Lots of my friends have told me they have experienced something similar with Virgin customer service.' She added that she had been reduced to tears by the company's 'insensitive attitude', saying that is could have 'destroyed' an older woman.

"An Alabama woman has been sentenced to 219 years in prison for her role in an incestuous sex ring accused of molesting children for years. Wendy Holland, 35, showed no emotion as the judge condemned her on Thursday to what amounts to a life sentence. She must serve at least 50 years in prison before parole consideration, a prosecutor said. Jurors convicted the woman of sodomy, sexual abuse and other charges last month. Scroll down for video . Wendy Holland, 35, showed no emotion as the judge sentenced her to 219 years in prison on Thursday for her role in an incestuous sex ring accused of molesting children for years (file photo from court date last month) Another defendant, William Brownlee, got a 20-year prison sentence. Brownlee, 50, was convicted of sodomy and sexual abuse in the fall. The two were among 11 people charged with sex crimes following the disappearance in 2012 of a suspected victim of the ring, 19-year-old Brittney Wood. She remains missing and is presumed dead. Baldwin Council Circuit Judge Jody Bishop gave both Holland and Brownlee the maximum sentence and said each deserved more time. Each still faces additional charges involving other alleged victims. In a letter read in court, the underage female victim in both cases said years of abuse left her traumatized. She has a hard time trusting anyone, gets angry easily and rarely feels safe. 'I was a little girl being held down and raped,' wrote the victim, who was in court. Authorities said the two were part of a group of relatives and friends who sexually abused children and swapped their own kids for sex for years. Evil couple: Wendy's husband Donnie Holland was at the center of the child abuse ring. He is now dead and his wife, according to prosecutors, was also a key player in dozens of cases of child abuse. His wife Wendy . Father and son 'abusers': Donnie Holland Sr. (right) is at the center of the pedophile ring in Alabama described by police and prosectors as the worst they have ever seen, while his son Donnie Jr . Holland is the widow of the alleged leader of the group, Donnie Holland, who was Brittney Wood's uncle. The teen went missing around the time Holland was found with a gunshot to the head; his death was later ruled a suicide. Wendy and Donnie Holland's 22-year-old son Donald Paul Holland Jr. — charged with incest, rape and sexual abuse as another alleged participant in the ring — appeared before the judge in a closed hearing after his mother's sentencing. He was seen being arrested and led away in handcuffs afterward, but the outcome of his case wasn't made public because he was handled as a youthful offender following a request by the defense. Even without Brittney Wood to testify, two of her uncles and an older brother already pleaded guilty to sex charges before juries convicted Wendy Holland and Brownlee. In the letter read in court, the underage teen abused by both Holland, a relative, and Brownlee, a family friend, compared her youth to being lost in a maze. The teen said she felt like she was constantly looking into shadows around corners in fear of more sexual torture. 'The people who were supposed to protect me were the ones hurting me,' she wrote in the letter. Last month a jury took just two hours to find Wendy Holland guilty of sodomy, sexual abuse, sexual torture and child endangerment. William Brownlee, right, received a 20-year prison sentence on Thursday for his role in the three-generation Alabama family sex ring. Details about the group emerged following the disappearance in 2012 of a suspected victim of the ring, 19-year-old Brittney Wood, left. She remains missing and is presumed dead . Brittney Wood's uncle Donnie Holland, left, killed himself not long after her disappearance.  Wendy and Donnie Holland's 22-year-old son Donald Paul Holland Jr., right, has been charged with incest, rape and sexual abuse as another alleged participant in the ring . The trial gave no clue as to the whereabouts of the presumed dead family member Brittney Wood, but it did give voice to abuse victims who claimed the sexual torture started when kids were still in diapers and involved family six-ways. A teenager testifying to being part of a family sex ring told jurors Tuesday that she was first molested while still in diapers. The young woman, who is still a minor, said her earliest memories include having sex with adult relatives — one of whom was Holland. Despite that, the teen tearfully said she still loves Holland 'with all my heart.' The state rested its case following a session during which the teen testified that her relatives often had group sex. She said it sometimes including Holland's missing 19-year-old niece Brittney Wood. 'We would be in a circle and we'd all switch up,' the girl testified. Prosecutor Teresa Heinz asked how often such things occurred. 'It happened a bunch,' she said. A male relative who pleaded guilty later testified he once had six-way sex with a group of relatives that included the girl and Holland. Crying, the teen had to stand up to see over the judge's desk to identify Holland as one of the people who abused her. Holland dabbed at her eyes and looked at the girl only briefly. Brittney Wood was last seen at Tillman's Corner, Alabama, in May 2012. She is presumed dead . Nephew Andrew Aikin, 23, who escaped the abuse, told MailOnline: 'Donnie was the cool uncle. 'We used to have huge barbecues. Donnie would invite us all out there. 'Us kids would to swimming and tubing and there were jet-skis. We had a lot of fun.' But in February 2012, at aged 50, the facade began to fell apart - and within months Donnie was dead and a horrific trail of abuse beginning to unravel. The first chink in the wall of silence came in March 2012 when Randall Scott Wood, then 42, alerted the authorities that a 13-year-old family member, with whom he admitted he was having a sexual relationship, was being abused by others. Wood, a former member of the National Guard, had moved to Mobile to take up a well-paid job at the city's steel mill. His sister - Wendy - was Holland's wife. What he told police was deeply unsettling - but as they began to investigate a far clearer picture of depravity emerged. In fact, his testimony against a relative lifted the lid on an horrific lifestyle going on at Donnie Holland's home. The innocent barbecues were only part of the truth - there were barbecues, but what happened later was not innocent. Fathers and mothers, uncles and aunts, brothers and sisters would end the evening revelling in group sex with children as young as four. Groomed almost from birth the young victims would be told to watch the scenes of depravity from the end of the bed until they were deemed old enough to take part. Mobile Assistant District Attorney Nicki Patterson told MailOnline: 'What is so disturbing with this case is that we have so many people involved. Chessie Wood, Brittney's mother: Two counts of sodomy and sex abuse of a child less than 12. Derek Wood, Brittney's brother: Second degree rape and second degree sodomy. Nelton ‘Butch’ Morgan: Rape and sex abuse of a child under 12. Dustin Kent: Two counts of rape, sex abuse, sodomy and production of obscene material of a person under 17. He allegedly raped a 13-year-old while her father looked on . William 'Billy' Brownlee: Two counts of rape, sodomy and sex abuse. Mendy Kent: Sodomy and sex abuse. Wendy Holland: Sodomy, sex abuse and child torture. James Cumbaa: Rape, sodomy, and sex abuse. Randall Scott Wood: Second degree sodomy, enticing a child to enter and second degree rape. Jennifer Moore: Production of pornography involving minors and second-degree child abuse. Donald Holland Jr: Incest and second degree rape . 'They led a swinger's lifestyle. They would engage in adult group sex but Donnie Holland would involve the children frequently. 'There were children who were 14 or 15 years old which may have appeared to be young adults but there also there were children who were clearly prepubescent – as young as nine years old.' She added: 'They barbecued a lot. They would have parties and then they would end up in bed together. 'Some of the kids' earliest memories at three or four years old are of abuse. 'Some of the women used sex toys on the kids to get them ready for sex. It was a very important thing within the family. They put an enormous effort in to get the children ready. It was very thought out. 'The mom, the aunt and children would get into bed and Donnie would tell them what to do.' Donnie would often film the sex scenes to create pornographic movies. One of the victims, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was abused so regularly it became her normal life. Baldwin District Attorney Teresa Heinz told MailOnline: 'For these children this is what happened at the weekend. They did not know that other kids did not do this. 'The kids would be offered trinkets – more TV time, credit for their cell phone, presents – if they took part and punished if they did not. 'Brittney Wood was a victim as early as four, or five years old. 'Another girl was French kissed for the first time at the age of four. The sexual abuse started soon after.

'So far my daughter has not had to discipline her overly exuberant grandparents too much,' he joked . 'It's so fun,' he said. 'So far my daughter has not had to discipline her overly exuberant grandparents too much,' he joked. 'You know, these young people, they know what the rules are on child rearing. It's very impressive.' He said that he and Hillary are able to see Charlotte frequently because Chelsea and Marc live in New York City. Doting grandparents: Bill and Hillary Clinton had long spoken of their desire to have a grandchild - which came true last year . Hollywood heavyweight: Chelsea Clinton enjoyed an evening out at a dinner hosted by Relativity Studios to celebrate the release of their new film Black or White, which stars Oscar-winner Kevin Costner (right) During the interview Seth Meyers coyly asked him whether he would live in a different house in 2016, to which he laughingly responded: 'I hope not, because 2016 is the election year and I don't have any place to move.' Since the birth, Charlotte has been growing up in the family's $10million apartment in the nearby Flatiron District. The couple bought the home in the beautiful Whitman Building, near Madison Square Park, a year ago - relocating from their last $4million apartment just a block away. The $5,000-square-foot apartment occupies an entire floor of the building, and comes with four bedrooms, six and a half bathrooms, a home office and den. Its interior is lit with natural light, thanks to the floor to ceiling windows that look over the nearby greenspace. The couple also have their own 252-square-foot terrace to baby-proof. In November during an appearance on the Ellen Show Clinton went on to recall the day Chelsea gave birth and riding in the car to the hospital with Hillary to see Charlotte for the first time, and the hilarious conversation they had about their role as grandparents.

The duo were at the school to officially name a new art studio on behalf of art therapy charity, The Art Room, and the Duchess was given some art of her own to take home. As she chatted to Perry outside the school, a pair of pupils approached with a pint-sized printed chair in their hands, presumably made with Prince George in mind, and presented it to the Duchess. A clearly delighted Kate, who was making her first public appearance since Christmas Day, then bent down to pick up the artwork and thank the children who made it. The Duchess, who is six months pregnant, showed a hint of baby bump beneath her £450 ‘Naomi’ shift dress, which is still available to buy although the company’s website has already crashed to unprecedented public interest. Kate is not the first royal to have worn the brand while expecting  – Prince William’s cousin, Zara Phillips, also favoured it when pregnant with her daughter, Mia. All parts of the dress are British made, including the fabric  from Yorkshire textile mill Hainsworth, who describe it as ‘doeskin’, which mimics the appearance and feel of the skin of a female deer. By contrast, Perry said he had made his dress himself and declared the over-the-top black cocktail number with voluminous net underskirts to be his ‘ladies who lunch’ outfit. ‘I thought it was appropriate for the occasion,’ said the married father-of-one, who also wore black heels like the Duchess but with sheer, instead of opaque, tights. Although the duchess got top marks for style, her hair was much less easy to manipulate and whipped around her head on several occasions thanks to strong winds . Hint of a bump: A tiny baby bump could be seen beneath the Duchess' dress. She is due to give birth to her second child in April . Busy week: The Duchess has a further engagement to complete this week and will complete another one on Monday . Speaking about the Duchess, he commented: 'If she goes somewhere the media will follow. 'It's up to her to use that to shine a laser beam upon the organisation with which she is working, it's her job. And she wields it with enormous grace as far as I can see.' The Turner prize-winning artist also described Kate, who has a series of royal engagements over the coming days, as 'looking pretty chic for six months'. The new Clore art studio, which the Duchess officially named today, will be run by The Art Room, a charity of which both the Duchess and Perry are patrons, which provides art therapy for underprivileged children. 85 children all aged between five and 11, will receive art sessions designed to provide them with self-confidence, self-esteem and independence in the new studio each week. Inside the new art room the Duchess met with a group of eight children and asked them about their paintings. At one point one little boy said to her: ‘You would like to be a chicken’ to which she laughed and replied: ‘I would like to be a chicken? ‘Maybe, actually!’ She also took part in a round table discussion with charity founder Juli Beattie and fellow patron Grayson Perry. Speaking during the discussion, Perry said: ‘This is a normalised version of what I found out for myself, which is that an art practice is where you can go to soothe yourself. ‘A day like today makes everyone feel special that it's being taken seriously. Often people regard art as a kind of add-on. Certainly the recent education minister - mentioning no names Michael Gove - seemed to think art was this thing you could somehow elbow off the curriculum. ‘Yes, it's a huge part of Britain Plc and an essential part of life. We shouldn't think it's just something for posh people. That's why I identify so much with the Art Room because I come from that sort of background, a working class background.' First outing: This is the first time the Duchess has been seen in public since attending church with the rest of the royals on Christmas Day . Joining forces: The Duchess of Cambridge and Grayson Perry, who was resplendent in black, are both patrons of The Art Room . Is that for me? Two of the children, supervised by Grayson Perry, present the Duchess of Cambridge with a collage-covered chair . Delighted: The royal mother-to-be looked absolutely thrilled as the children presented her with the handmade gift . The room is named after the Clore Duffield Foundation which has been making donations to The Art Room since 2005 and will cover the running costs for the new space over the next three years. The Duchess had planned to officially open the facility last autumn but was forced to cancel the engagement after developing hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of morning sickness. Although the space is now open, it was yet to be officially named - a function the Duchess completed during today's event, as well as speaking to staff and children who have benefited from The Art Room workshops already. As Kate left the school after her hour-long engagement she was greeted by 250 flag-waving children - each of whom had drawn a portrait of the the Duchess on the back. The royal looked delighted  and stopped to speak to several of the cheering youngsters before getting into her official car. Kensington Palace said the engagement reflects the Duchess’s interest in the arts and her keenness on the concept of using the creativity of art to enrich the lives of young people. Chair to the throne! The Duchess looked thoroughly impressed with the gift made for her by the Ladbroke Grove primary school pupils . Supporter: Like the Duchess, the artist is a long-term supporter of The Art Room, a charity that provides art therapy to children . Big day: After being presented with a pint-sized chair, the Duchess went to speak with other pupils - some of whom looked a little bashful . A spokesman for the Art Room explained that there are many reasons why children are referred to their practitioners and why they need time away from their mainstream classrooms. Some might be youngsters suffering bereavements, family breakdown or a chaotic home life, while others could be living with violence or abuse. Among them are also children on the autistic spectrum and others recently arrived in the UK. According to the charity, children are encouraged to open up about anxieties as they paint in the hopes that they will ultimately learn to cope with the difficulties they face. Referrals can comes from teachers, parents and social workers or other adults involved in their lives. Speaking ahead of the Duchess' arrival, one Year 5 child, who wishes to remain anonymous, said: 'I look forward to visiting The Art Room. It’s like having thinking space. Painting makes me feel good and I feel in a better mood afterwards.' Head teacher Anthony Mannix added: ‘It is extremely exciting to be able to host HRH The Duchess of Cambridge as we can proudly introduce her to our children and show the school and our ethos. ‘Since opening The Art Room in October, we have been overwhelmed with the positive benefits it has brought to the children. Nice to meet you: Many of the children are among those being given art therapy by The Art Room, of which the Duchess is patron . Warm welcome: The Duchess of Cambridge was cheered as she went to leave by a crowd of excited children . Fresh-faced: The Duchess, who looked rosy-cheeked and on good form, was clearly benefiting from a pregnancy glow . Stopping to chat: The Duchess, who was accompanied by her close protection team, insisted on stopping and was given a bunch of flowers . All smiles: The Duchess smiled broadly as she chatted to young well-wishers outside the school in Ladbroke Grove . Scrum: Standing opposite the children was a horde of photographers, eager to get the perfect shot of the Duchess .","The Duchess of Cambridge was at Barlby Primary School in Ladbroke Grove to name an art room .

"Sarah Tetley, 26, from Melton Mowbray, awoke to her husband Charlie Tetley, now 34, molesting her. She reported him to the police and they confiscated his computer, where they found 300 films of Charlie raping and abusing his wife as she slept . A woman has spoken of her horror at discovering her husband had been secretly raping her while she slept and filming the attacks. Sarah Tetley, from Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, fought through panic attacks and depression to see her now-ex partner Charlie Tetley put behind bars after the terrifying assaults which took place in the bedroom they shared. The 26-year-old is now sharing her story in the hope that it will help other victims of abuse. Sarah thought that she had the fairy-tale marriage when she met Charlie Tetley in a pub when she was 18. Although he was eight years her senior, the couple instantly hit it off and began a relationship. In 2009, they completed their family when Sarah fell pregnant with their daughter, who is now four years old. But gradually, Charlie’s behaviour became more and more controlling and he would tell Sarah where she could be and how to behave with their child. Despite some reservations about his personality, Sarah agreed when her boyfriend proposed, thinking that marriage might iron out the problems in their relationship. So the couple married in 2011 at a local church in front of all of their family and friends. Instead of strengthening their bond, Charlie, now 34 and working in his father's double glazing business, became more distant after the wedding. He refused to let his wife use his computer and would regularly shut himself away in their bedroom in the evening. Scroll down for video . Sarah feared her husband was having an affair behind her back, but the truth was far worse – he had been raping her while she slept at night and recording the assaults. She made the discovery one morning when she woke up to find Charlie attacking her. As well as raping his wife, Charlie would also film himself molesting her with various household objects. She told This Morning: ‘At the time I thought, I'll just pretend I'm still asleep and see what's going on. ‘He stopped pretty quickly and I left the bedroom and went downstairs and sat up watching some rubbish on telly.’ On March 28, 2014, Charlie attended Leicester Crown Court and pleaded guilty to five counts of rape, attempted rape, eight counts of assault by penetration, three of sexual assault and ten of making indecent images of children. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison . After her husband left for work, she fled to her neighbour’s house and told them what was going on. The neighbour convinced Sarah to report her story to the police and officers came over immediately to take more details. Because of the type of the assault, the police confiscated Charlie’s laptop, video recorder and Xbox. While helping officers with their search, Sarah discovered seven external hard drives stashed under a piece of furniture in their bedroom and also handed those over to be examined. After accessing the hard drives and computer, Leicestershire police found shocking images of hardcore pornography. She went with the officers to make an official statement at the local station and the following day they arrested Charlie and charged him with charged with three counts of rape and two counts of assault by penetration. She told The Sun: ‘I was told they had found a bunch of videos showing Charlie raping and abusing me. ‘The officer said they were quite disturbing and that I needed to come to the station for an examination and drug testing because of the nature of the assaults and that I appeared to be unconscious in the videos.’ Sarah had her hair, blood and urine samples tested, but both her blood and urine tests came back from the lab negative and her hair sample was inconclusive. Then a few months later, Sarah was called back to the police station and asked to watch a few of the 300 recordings that Charlie had amassed over the years of him molesting her. The officers asked her to look over the footage ahead of the court case against her husband. She told This Morning that she was horrified by what she saw in the footage. Sarah has decided to speak out in the hope that her story will help other victims of abuse to come forward . She said: ‘A couple of the videos I watched you couldn't hear me be breathing and I didn't really appear to be moving at all. I did look like I was dead in some of them. ‘A lot of the videos weren’t just of him but of household objects and things he would decide to do with those, it was quite disturbing.’ One of the things that shocked her the most was that she had no idea that the abuse had been going on. She told Philp Schofield on the ITV programme she would occasionally wake up with a dead arm but there was nothing that had ever raised her suspicions until the morning that she woke up to find Charlie molesting her. Although the videos, which dated from January 2011 to December 2012, were sickening to watch, they were what the police needed to prove that Charlie was guilty of raping his wife. On March 28, 2014, Charlie attended Leicester Crown Court and pleaded guilty to five counts of rape, attempted rape, eight counts of assault by penetration, three of sexual assault and ten of making indecent images of children. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Since arrest, Sarah has suffered from panic attacks and depression. But over the last few months, she has tried to come to terms with the abuse and move on with her life. She has divorced Charlie and is now in a loving relationship with the neighbour who supported her after the attack and encouraged her to call the police. She has decided to speak out in the hope that her story will help other victims of abuse to come forward. She told This Morning: ‘If in any way you're being abused you should tell someone - even if it's just mentally - whatever kind of abuse it is. ‘And especially if people are secretive. It might be nothing but it might also be something quite big.’ To watch Sarah on This Morning, go to itv.com/thismorning .","Sarah Tetley, from Melton Mowbray, awoke to her husband molesting her .

"A primary school was forced into lockdown after a mystery gunman was spotted outside while children were on a lunch break, but the scare turned out to be police on an anti-terror exercise. The headteacher of St Luke's C of E Primary School in Cambridge has criticised police for carrying out the military training on Tuesday without letting them know in advance. Pupils informed teachers they had seen a man with a gun running behind some houses and were swiftly moved off the playing fields as staff searched the area. Pupils at St Luke's C of E Primary School in Cambridge told staff they spotted a man with a gun by school . Head teacher Steve Down said: 'I am disappointed the school was not informed that this exercise was happening. 'I have to ask if conducting such an exercise outside a school is the best place, but I am pleased at how well the school responded to keep the children safe. 'I will be speaking to the police further about the incident and how they are planning on closing the case.' Mr Down said no police, military vehicles or personnel were spotted near the school, which caters for 199 pupils, but two brothers said their friends who spotted the gunman were 'really scared'. Eight-year-old, Alec Brown,  said: 'My friend saw the man with the gun and now he is really scared. 'Why did they have guns near a school? They should have told the teachers.' His brother Eddie, six, said: 'The police are really stupid. How can they be secret when even a kid can see them with a gun. I thought they were supposed to be clever.' A 43-year-old mother, who asked not to be named, said her eight-year-old son was one of three boys who spotted the gunman on the other side of the railings on the school field. She said: 'He came home from school and I was asking him how his day was and he just started saying how he had seen this guy with a gun. 'They love building dens in that part of the field and climbing in the trees and it is right by the railings. 'They were just playing by there he said he saw this guy walking along carrying a gun, so they started to follow him. 'They saw him put it in his pocket and then he said he ""went to tell a grown up"". 'A first I thought ""oh was it really a gun"", or could it have been a lighter or something like that. But when he told me how the school acted I thought it must have been serious. 'It's very scary, only recently a gunshot was fired through a couple's house near to the school so I really do think this is the least sensitive place they could have held this exercise. Head teacher Steve Down said he is 'disappointed' with police for not informing them beforehand . 'Why did they do it there and why did they do at lunchtime? 'I have a lot of respect for the police and I know they have a hard job to do especially after what happened in Paris, but I just cannot understand why they did it. 'The boys were quite scared by it. I mean they're boys and they found it exciting but it's very scary at the same time. I think the school dealt with it really well though.' Parent and former teacher Fletcher Brock, 38, said: 'I can't believe the school weren't told about it. 'The man was right by the gate where a lot of the girls build dens so they would have been really close to him. 'Why was it held it the lunch hour and why just outside a school? I can't understand it.' Another parent, who asked not to be named, said: 'My son said the man had a handgun and was at the school fence and he is not prone to making things up. 'I think the school did the right thing. The teachers were brilliant as usual.' A similar training exercise by Cambridgeshire police in nearby St Ives the same day was captured in a video posted on Facebook by a passer-by. A police spokesman said: 'Cambridgeshire Constabulary is currently taking part in a joint training exercise with the military and other stakeholders. 'The exercise is over two days, Tuesday and Wednesday. This exercise forms an integral part of our training programme to test our contingency plans. 'The event is pre-planned and not arranged in response to any increased threat to the region. 'Members of the public may see an increased police presence in the exercise area, while the exercise is live. 'They can be assured that during the event, they will not experience any reduction in the quality of service provided.' But police later claimed the pupils who saw the gunman had ‘overactive imaginations’. Meanwhile a primary school in Wiltshire has defended its decision stage an emergency 'lock-down drill', just days after the Paris massacre. Children at Westbury Leigh Primary School in the town were told to hide under their desks and told to keep quiet to practice what they should do in an emergency situation. But while some parents welcomed the drill, others criticised the school for not warning them and claim their children were frightened and left suffering from nightmares. Westbury Primary School in Wiltshire has defended its decision to stage an emergency 'lock-down drill' Kimberley Turner, whose seven-year-old son goes to the school in Westbury, Wiltshire, said: 'My son learned what a terrorist was from school last week, he's seven. 'Since then I have found one of his drawings of a terrorist holding an axe with an injured person covered in blood. 'I'm terrified he's going to Google it and be met with some of the recent beheading videos.' Writing on Facebook, another parent Julia Vowles added: 'It would be nice to have it communicated to the parents. 'That way we are prepared for any questions that may arise from our children and for any other issues that may arise.' The drill on Friday saw 400 pupils aged four to 11 prepare for anything from a dangerous stranger on the premises, to a terrorist attack. While staff did not specifically mention 'terrorists', parents criticised the timing of the event, and said children would have seen the Paris tragedy on TV. Headteacher Debbie Grimsey said the school has been holding drills for its 'lockdown/sheltering procedure' for 'a number of years' alongside fire evacuations. She said: 'Emergency evacuation and sheltering is practised regularly. Using both drills enable us to prepare children for an unplanned situation. 'It makes sure they are aware of what is expected of them and also minimise any panic, which can occur in an emergency situation, such as an external gas leak. 'As a result of each drill we assess and review how well our policies and procedures have worked and seek to improve our practice further. Our main priority is the safety of all pupils, staff and visitors on site.'","Pupils at St Luke's C of E Primary School in Cambridge spotted a 'gunman'

"Nigeria's president has made a surprise visit to the heartland of the Boko Haram movement to meet survivors of the massacre which saw an estimated 2,500 people slaughtered by Islamist militants. Goodluck Jonathan spent three hours in Maidugri, capital of Borno State, and addressed 5,000 people who have been sheltering in a camp since the attack by the terror group earlier this month. The president's visit comes just a day after new images obtained by Amnesty International show the devastation of the assault - with more than 3,700 structures including houses and schools completely destroyed in the towns of Baga and Doron Baga. Scroll down for video . President Goodluck Jonathan, dressed in a grey shirt and dark hat, meets survivors of the Boko Haram massacre in Nigeria, which is thought to have killed 2,500 people . The president addressed the crowd and told them that all areas of Nigeria under the control of Boko Haram would be recaptured soon . Around 5,000 people are currently living in a camp after their towns were completely destroyed in the deadly attack . One witness of the attack described how the ruthless terror group were shooting indiscriminately, killing even small children and a woman who was in labour. During his visit to the camp, Mr Jonathan promised that all areas of Nigeria under the control of Boko Haram would be recaptured soon. He told the crowd of displaced people: 'I want to assure you that you will soon go back to your houses.' The president's visit to Maiduguri - his first since March 2013 - was shrouded in secrecy and came after a previous trip to the region in May last year was cancelled at the last minute.

Nigeria's leader has come under fierce criticism for his failure to crush Boko Haram's bid to establish a hardline Islamic state in northeast Nigeria. His visit comes after aerial shots emerged yesterday of the towns taken a day before the attack and a day after, showing the massive scale of destruction after the massacre. They were released by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, who said the images suggested 'devastation of catastrophic proportions'. They added that 11 per cent of Baga and 57 percent of Doron Baga was flattened, most likely by fire. Human Rights Watch said the exact death toll was unknown and quoted one local resident as saying: 'No one stayed back to count the bodies. People were forced to queue up to take refuge inside a 'Teachers Village' in Maiduguri after their homes were destroyed in the Boko Haram attack . Children play on the ground outside the refuge. More than 3,700 structures including houses and schools were completely destroyed in the towns of Baga and Doron Baga . 'We were all running to get out of town ahead of Boko Haram fighters who have since taken over the area.' Meanwhile Amnesty cited reports of women being rounded up and detained at a school. They added: 'The deliberate killing of civilians and destruction of their property by Boko Haram are war crimes and crimes against humanity and must be duly investigated.' It comes as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry accused the Islamist insurgents of a 'crime against humanity'. He described Boko Haram as a 'serious threat to all of our values' during a visit to Bulgaria with British foreign secretary Philip Hammond.

"Police investigating the death of a six-year-old girl strongly considered the possibility that she intentionally killed herself, it has emerged. Kendrea Johnson was found dead with a rope around her neck at her foster home in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota on December 27. Officers this week said the manner of the schoolgirl’s death could not be determined – but records have emerged suggesting those investigating the tragedy thought it was possible she had taken her own life. Kendrea Johnson was found dead with a rope around her neck at her foster home in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota on December 27 . A picture of a smiling Kendrea and her birth mom Dareesha before a child protection unit took her into care . Kendrea's birth mom was said to have had drug addiction problems and failed to keep to an agreed protection plan which resulted in action taken by the child protection unit in 2013 . The Star Tribune says it has seen records which suggest Kendrea had been assessed in June as having ‘homicidal and suicidal thoughts’ and had been receiving treatment . Records state that the child ‘showed severe guilt, as she does not feel lovable or acceptable and reports feeling guilty and responsible for out-of-home placement,’ the newspaper reports. The records show that Kendrea was put in foster care in 2013 after a child protection unit accused her mother of drug abuse and failing to keep to an agreed protection plan, the Star Tribune report says. The youngster’s behavior reportedly changed in care and one foster mother said the child had wanted to end her life by jumping out of a window and drew pictures at school of a child hanging from a rope. According to the records, police also discovered healed ligature marks on the sides of her neck. At first, Kendrea had suicidal thoughts every day of the week, but this had eased to five days a week in the run up to her death, according to the report. Records have emerged suggesting those investigating the tragedy thought it was possible she had taken her own life . However, the records also suggest that Kendrea was in a ‘good mood’ in the last few hours before the tragedy and had enjoyed a second helping of food at dinner before going to her room to watch television. Her father informed police that everything seemed fine when he had looked in on the youngster at 8pm – but ten minutes later he found her hanged in the bedroom. Officers, in an initial report of the incident, noted that the rope’s knot appeared too sophisticated for someone so young, the Star Tribune reports. Kendrea’s grandmother Mary Lee Broadus, told the newspaper that she believed the youngster did not take her own life suggesting: ‘Somebody did it.’ Deputy Chief Mark Bruley from Brooklyn Park Police Department told the Star Tribune that ultimately investigators agreed with the medical examiner that such an act was ‘outside what a normal six-year-old could think about.’ ‘We may never know if it was suicide or an accident,’ he added.","Kendrea Johnson, 6, was found dead with rope around neck at foster home .

"Power may corrupt but it can also makes people messy eaters, scientists have found. They discovered that influential people quickly develop bad table manners, such as chewing with their mouths open and showering crumbs all over themselves. Psychologists think that temporary changes to the frontal lobe in the brain may be to blame, which makes people more impulsive and self-centred. Scroll down for video . Psychologists have discovered that people in a position of power are likely to treat themselves to any remaining pieces of food on a plate (illustrated), displaying selfish tendencies, and quickly develop bad table manners, such as chewing with their mouths open and showering crumbs all over themselves . Psychologist Dacher Keltner and his team at the University of California, Berkeley, made the discovery when conducting an experiment that they refer to as the ‘cookie monster study,’ so called perhaps, because of the Sesame Street character’s vigorous way of eating biscuits. In it, they divided volunteers into groups of three and arbitrarily appointed one of them as leader. They then gave the trio a boring task – devising some university policies – before bringing out a surprise plate of chocolate chip cookies. Psychologist Dacher Keltner and his team at the University of California, Berkeley, made the discovery when conducting an experiment that they refer to as the ‘cookie monster study,’ so called because of the Sesame Street character’s vigorous way of eating biscuits (pictured in a stock image) Three months ago, scientists claimed that being in a position of power can change the way you speak to people. They said that the cues, such as talking more loudly with less variation in pitch - tell people who is really in charge, regardless of what an individual is saying. ‘Our findings suggest that whether it's parents attempting to assert authority over unruly children, haggling between a car salesman and customer, or negotiations between heads of states, the sound of the voices involved may profoundly determine the outcome of those interactions,’ psychological scientist Sei Jin Ko of San Diego State University said. In the experiment, 'high status' individuals tended to make their voices go up in pitch slightly. Powerful people had more monotonous voices without as much variety in pitch as more lowly workers. Their voices also varied more in volume than the voices of students assigned low-power roles. It revealed that generally speaking, powerful people speak louder than others and that listeners naturally pick up these cues to work out people in positions of authority. In a video explaining the experiment, Dr Keltner explained: ‘Everybody takes one cookie, but all groups always leave one cookie on the plate, because they don’t want to be that person that takes the last cookie.’ They discovered that half of the time, the leaders reached out to take the final cookie, perhaps showing they have become more selfish while in power. Dr Keltner said that one of his graduate students noticed that appointed leaders in the experiments often had bad table manners. ‘Our high-power person is more likely to eat with their mouth open, lips smacking, crumbs literally like falling onto their sweater. It’s ridiculous,’ he said. He explained that ‘when you powerful, you kind of lose touch with other people. You stop attending carefully to what other people think.’ This is because when people are given power, they share some traits with sociopaths. Regions of the frontal lobe, referred to as the ‘empathy network’ help people detect other people’s pain. Victims of head trauma, who suffer damage to empathy networks, often become impulsive, so that model citizens with ‘acquired sociopathy’ can suddenly start swearing and yell at people, as well as feeling disconnected. ‘Our lab studies find, if you give people a little bit of power, they look a little bit like those brain trauma patients,’ Dr Keltner said.","Powerful people are likely to be selfish when claiming remaining treats left on a plate at the expense of others, such as a final cookie .

"A Czech policeman trying to shoot a dog that had attacked him, missed the animal and killed its owner. The unnamed police officer accidentally shot the 23-year-old dog-owner in the head, killing him instantly. The incident happened in town of Prerov in the eastern Czech Republic after local police had been sent to stop a punch-up outside a bar. Crime scene: This is the location in Prerov, Czech Republic, where the dog owner was accidentally shot dead . Vigil: Candles have been lit for the 23-year-old, whose dog was attacking another man when police arrived . Resolution: Officers at the scene unsuccessfully tried to calm the aggressive situation between the two men . When the officers arrived at the bar in the town centre, they initially tried to calm the group intoxicated men, but the attempt proved unsuccessful, a police spokesperson said. 'The police officers were threatened by the dog, and so they used their service pistols to defend themselves,' police spokesperson Marta Vlachova said. A witness who did not wish to be named told local TV: 'The policeman who was trying to calm down the person involved in the fight and was attacked by the dog which was protecting its owner. 'The dog wasn't on a dog lead at the time. 'The police officer didn't shoot the dog immediately, but after it had repeatedly attacked him he was forced to take out his gun and it was clear he wanted to shoot the dog. But the bullet accidentally hit the owner of the dog.' Another witness told local news website Nejlepsi-adresa.cz: 'Before midnight in front of the bar Lumir, about ten to 15 drunk people started to fight. We were watching it from our window. Self defence: Police spokesperson,  Marta Vlachova (pictured), said: 'The police officers were threatened by the dog, and so they used their service pistols to defend themselves' 'The dog was involved in the fighting, it seemed to be trying to pull its owner out of the mass of fighting men. He wasn't doing anything to stop it biting people. 'The people were shouting and beating each other. Because the fight lasted too long, my mother called the police.' According to the witness, two police cars arrived there about five minutes later and the policemen had talked to the troublemakers. The witness says he saw the dog running towards the policeman after which he heard one shot go off, and the animal's owner fell to the ground. Police spokesperson Vlachova confirmed the incident, but was not able to ive any further information about the case.","Police officer had been called to stop bar brawl in eastern Czech Republic .

"High street giant H&M is among almost 40 companies named and shamed by the government for failing to pay workers the minimum wage. The retailer failed to pay a total of £2,604.87 to 540 staff, according to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. A total of 37 employers including hair salons, car dealers and estate agents underpaid staff by £177,000, behaviour condemned by ministers as 'illegal, immoral and completely unacceptable'. High street retailer H&M failed to pay a total of £2,604.87 to 540 staff, according to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills . Welcome Break, the service station company, neglected to pay £1,318.70 to 19 workers. Hertfordshire estate agents Kings Group underpaid 43 members of staff by £53,808.91 while the company's lettings arm neglected to pay £26,893.43 to 49 workers. The 37 firms listed by the government face financial penalties totalling more than £51,000. Business minister Jo Swinson said: 'Paying less than the minimum wage is illegal, immoral and completely unacceptable. 'If employers break this law they need to know that we will take tough action by naming, shaming and fining them as well as helping workers recover the hundreds of thousands of pounds in pay owed to them. 'We are also looking at what more we can do to make sure workers are paid fairly in the first place. As well as being publicly named and shamed, employers that fail to pay their workers the national minimum wage face penalties of up to £20,000. 'We are legislating through the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill so that this penalty can be applied to each underpaid worker rather than per employer.' Business minister Jo Swinson said: 'Paying less than the minimum wage is illegal, immoral and completely unacceptable' Almost 100 employers have now been publicly named by the Government since a new regime came into force in October 2013. Unions have been pressing for larger fines against firms found to be paying less than the statutory rate of £6.50 an hour for adults, £5.13 for 18 to 20-year-olds, £3.79 for 16 and 17-year-olds and £2.73 for apprentices. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'It's good to see the Government getting tough on bad bosses who cheat hard-working employees out of the pay they're legally entitled to. But with over 600 employers being caught underpaying each year, those named and shamed today are only the tip of the iceberg. 'There are companies out there that cheat hundreds of staff out of a legal minimum wage - these are the biggest offenders and their pay crimes must be made public too. Ministers must also step up enforcement action with more prosecutions, higher fines and a bigger team of enforcement officers to catch the cheats.' The TUC recently published a 10 point plan for minimum wage enforcement, including a call for much higher fines. Philip Pepper, employment law partner at Shakespeares, said: 'There are a number of reasons why employers may have got this wrong or been caught out. It is most likely due to human error, but in some cases minimum wage regulations can be complex to apply.' Estate agents Kings Group LLP, Hertfordshire, neglected to pay £53,808.91 to 53 workers .

"The home towns of the terrorists responsible for last week's attacks in France do not want to bury the gunmen amid fears their graves will become shrines for Islamic extremists. Town officials have admitted they want to 'avoid' burying Said and Cherif Kouachi, behind the massacre at Charlie Hebdo, and Amedy Coulibaly, shot dead after a siege at a Jewish deli in Paris. Under French law, the burials must take place either in the district where the deceased lived or the district where they were killed. Scroll down for video . Concerns are growing over where the terrorists responsible for the Charlie Hebdo massacre will be buried, with towns fearing the graves of Cherif (left) and Said Kouachi (right) could become Islamic extremist shrines . The hometown of Amedy Coulibaly, who killed four in the kosher deli in eastern Paris before being killed in a hail of police gunfire, isn't keen to bury the terrorist . The Kouachi brothers were shot dead by the police as they charged out of a printworks in Dammartin-en-Goele, north east of Paris, meaning they could be buried nearby. Their father died when they were young and they were taken into care, meaning they have no immediate family who wish to organise a possible funeral and burial elsewhere. A spokesman for Dammartin-en-Goele's local council told The Times: 'If we have to bury them here, we will obey the law, but we'd rather avoid it.' Chérif Kouachi lived in Gennevilliers, a suburb north of Paris, and his brother lived in  Reims, northeastern France. Both town councils refused to comment but it is understood that they want to avoid the terrorists being buried in their regions. Coulibaly died in a hail of police gunfire in Paris after murdering four of his hostages at the kosher supermarket. Funerals were held today for some of those killed in the Charlie Hebdo attack, including police officer Franck Brinsolaro . Officers applauded when the coffin of Brinsolaro was carried out of a church draped in the French flag . Hundreds gathered outside the town hall of Montreuil, Paris, for the funeral of Charlie Hebdo cartoonist Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac . He lived in Fontenay-aux-Roses, a Paris suburb. A spokesman for the town's mayor said: 'If his family decide to bury him here, I don't think we'll be able to avoid it. The law is strict. But we hope he will be buried somewhere else.' Meanwhile funerals are being held for staff killed in the attack on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo amid continued demand for its first edition since the massacre killed 12 people. Hundreds gathered for the ceremonies for Franck Brinsolaro, the killed police officer whose job it was to guard Charlie Hebdo editor and cartoonist Stéphane 'Charb' Charbonnier. Policemen broke into applause as the coffin of Mr Brinsolaro was carried into a church in the town of Bernay this morning. Otter funerals to take place were those of cartoonist Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac and psychoanalyst and Charlie Hebdo columnist Elsa Cayat.","Home towns of Charlie Hebdo terrorists do not want to bury gunmen .

"Pope Francis has just landed in the Philippines - to a crowd of thousands, church bells and an airport greeting from President Benigno Aquino. The Pope is in Asia, having begun his trip just days ago with a stop in Sri Lanka, for a week-long tour, and has already caused a huge spike in interest when it comes to travel in the region. Flight searches to Sri Lanka have increased by 19 per cent, while the numbers for the Philippines have increased by a whopping 51 per cent week on week from last year. Pope Francis has just arrived in the Philippines - and already travel searches for the region have spiked . The Pope's six-day Asian tour includes stops in Manila, where adoring crowds waited, and Sri Lanka . Interest in Manila has seen a particular increase, up 60 per cent already, according to Cheapflights.co.uk . Cheapflights.co.uk spokesperson Oonah Shiel attributes this 'halo effect' to the Pope's genuine mass appeal. Of particular interest to travellers is Manila, where His Holiness is expected to deliver a huge open air mass on Sunday, January 18, to over 5 million attendees. 'Searches regarding the Filipino capital are up 60 per cent and counting,' she said. Week on week from last year, searches for the Philippines have increased by 51%. Pictured: Palawan . When His Holiness arrived at the Manila airport, Filipino children performed in his honour . Following his stop in Sri Lanka, where the Pope canonised its first saint, travel interest has gone up by 19% . 'As well as driving short-term interest in flights to the region, the Pope's visit is expected to raise awareness of the plight of the more marginalised groups in the area and provide a longer-term boost to ethical tourism,' Shiel added. In fact, Pope Francis has already canonised Sri Lanka's first saint, after calling for unity in the conflict-hit nation. 'Every step he makes, every car ride he takes, every moment he stays with us is precious for us,' said Archbishop Socrates Villegas, president of Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines. 'Seeing him pass by is a grace.'","Flight searches for the Philippines up over 50% week on week from 2014 .

"A 'hero dog' who alerted residents when their New Jersey apartment building was on fire last Friday  has been found dead after disappearing in the blaze. Ann Marie Kelt, 51, and her longtime friend Rocky Granata were woken by Kelt's pet Labrador Stella as smoke filled her King Georges Road home around 6am. Thanks to the barking everyone evacuated the building safely but Stella got left behind. Neighbors thought the canine had run off, however on Tuesday her remains were found in the rubble of her former abode. Hero: A black Labrador named Stella who alerted residents when their New Jersey apartment building was on fire last Friday has been found dead after disappearing in the blaze . Granata told My Central Jersey that he discovered the black mixed-breed canine under a blanket. She appeared to be guarding her owner's purse, which remained intact. '[Stella] had her mother's pocketbook. She knew how important it was,' Granata said. 'That was amazing.' Kelt's daughter, Megan Holden of Sayreville, said that Stella previously suffered from cancer and had a heart condition. Due to her illness, a veterinarian believed the pet probably died after taking a few breaths in the smoke-filled apartment. 'I pray she did go quickly,' Holden said. The St. Georges Veterinary Hospital gave the family a keepsake paw print and arranged for Stella's cremation. Other than her purse, Kelt lost everything in the fire. Early morning blaze: Ann Marie Kelt, 51, and her longtime friend Rocky Granata were woken by Kelt's pet Labrador Stella as smoke filled her King Georges Road home around 6am . She and Granata were taken to hospital for smoke inhalation and anxiety. A third resident in the apartment block was also treated and all were released after getting the go-ahead. Kelt is currently staying with her daughter while Granata has been relocated to a hotel. The two friends attended the same high school and bonded after battling cancer together. The local community is now rallying together to raise funds for the out-of-home couple.","Ann Marie Kelt, 51, and her longtime friend Rocky Granata were woken by Kelt's pet pooch Stella last Friday morning .

"Chancellor George Osborne urged people not to go to A&E if they do not need to . The A&E crisis has left patients to be treated in store cupboards because their is not enough room in clinical areas, George Osborne was warned today. The Chancellor said the treatment was a 'matter of regret' for the whole government as he urged people not to go to A&E if they do not need to. It comes as leaked figures show that last week every NHS trust missed the target for seeing patients in A&E within four hours. The soaring number of visits has been blamed on an ageing population and patients flocking to hospitals to have minor ailments treated. The government has come under increasing pressure over the winter crisis in the NHS, with Labour vowing to make the health service a central plank of its election campaign. Senior doctors warn that since April there have been more than 14 million visits to A&E, a rise of 446,049 on the previous year. NHS bosses warn it could take up to five years to tackle the problems causing backlogs in A&E departments. Appearing on ITV's Good Morning Britain, Mr Osborne was challenged over the story of a viewer who was looked after in a store cupboard because there was no room for him in the A&E department. The Chancellor said: 'Every time a patient doesn't get the treatment that they deserve, that's a matter of regret. It is a matter of regret to me, it is a matter of regret to every member of the Government. First thing I'd say is the NHS staff is doing a brilliant job. 'We've put a lot of money into the NHS, partly because we've prioritised it, partly because we have a strong and growing economy.' He went on: 'There are more nurses, more doctors, but the truth is, I think everyone will understand this, there a rea lot more people going to A&E, more than a million more people going to A&E. 'I think we need to make sure that people have all the information they need about where they need to go if they feel there is something wrong with and they're not feeling well. And A&E is not always the answer for people. 'We've got to address why people aren't going to doctors surgeries, why they're not necessarily phoning the helplines that are available.' The soaring number of visits to A&E has been blamed on an ageing population and patients flocking to hospitals to have minor ailments treated . It comes as ministers brace themselves for the latest set of waiting times figures for January 5 and 11. Data obtained by the Daily Mirror shows that every trust in England, excluding foundation trusts, has failed to hit the target of treating 95 per cent of A&E patients within four hours. In some areas last week a third of people had to wait for more than four hours. Professor Keith Willett, who led a review of England's casualty units, yesterday insisted there was 'quick fix' to the chaos in many hospitals, which has seen the numbers visiting A&E surge by 400,000 since April as a result of the NHS 111 helpline. More doctors and nurses need to be recruited and the funding system changed to reduce waiting times and prevent bed blocking by elderly patients waiting for social care. Professor Keith Willett insisted there was 'quick fix' to the chaos in many hospitals, which has seen the numbers visiting A&E surge by 400,000 since April. Giving evidence to the health select committee, he said the entire health system needed to be overhauled to ensure changes in one area do not impact other parts of the NHS. 'We have had numerous examples over numerous years of doing one really good initiative in one part of the pathway and it doesn't have the effect we expect because the rest of the pathway is sufficiently busy to negate the advantages of that.' A Department of Health spokesperson said: 'We know the NHS is busier than ever before, which is why we've given a record £700million this winter for 700 more doctors, nearly 4500 more nurses and 5000 more beds. 'The NHS has ensured there are plans in every area to manage the extra demand.'","Chancellor challenged after TV viewer says he was treated in a store room .

But, doing so usually means having to manually enable the mode from the start. Google is hoping to automate this process with its latest patent, which aims to switch to private browsing every time a new session starts, or when a website asks for particular information. Google's patent (pictured) describes a system that could automatically open private browsing windows, or a user could ask that certain sites are always only opened in Incognito Mode. Alternatively, if Google detects that a site is asking for credit card details, it could switch to private browsing by default .

"Patients and doctors can adjust the settings for the 'pacemaker-like' device using external controllers . Federal regulators have approved an appetite-suppressing implant designed to treat obesity by zapping nerves that connect the stomach and the brain. The Maestro Rechargeable System uses electrodes implanted in the abdomen to stimulate the vagus nerve, which signals to the brain that the stomach is empty or full. Patients and doctors can adjust the device settings using external controllers. Shares of EnteroMedics rose in trading on Wednesday after the Food and Drug Administration said it approved the device for certain patients who are severely obese. It's the first medical device approved for obesity since the agency's 2007 approval of a gastric band from Ethicon. The FDA approved the device for patients 18 and older who have been unable to lose weight via a supervised weight-loss program and have a body mass index of 35 to 40 with one other obesity-related health condition, such as diabetes. BMI is an estimate of body fat based on weight and height. Someone who is 5-foot-9 would be severely obese — with a BMI of 35 — at 240 pounds. The Maestro Rechargeable System uses electrodes implanted in the abdomen to stimulate the vagus nerve, which signals to the brain that the stomach is empty or full . EnteroMedics said the device's two electrodes are implanted via a minimally-invasive surgical procedure, which could make the device system a less invasive alternative to other weight-loss surgeries. The device has an external battery that needs to be recharged weekly. The St. Paul, Minnesota-based company compares it to a pacemaker. A company executive said the device is already approved in Europe and Australia though it is not yet on sale. EnteroMedics plans to focus on the device's U.S. launch, targeting sales to surgical centers. The company is also pursuing reimbursement from health care insurance providers. EnteroMedics Inc. stock gained 30 cents, or 25 percent, to $1.47 in morning trading.

"RSPCA inspectors investigating an illegal dog fighting racket involving Pit Bull terriers discovered up to six of the animals were being trained to keep fit on a treadmill, a court heard today. Officers discovered the manually operated running machine along with syringes and scalpels during raids on three properties in East Lancashire where the dogs were seized. One of the confiscated dogs had a big chunk missing from its ear while another had a head injury. Investigators from the animal welfare organisation examined one cottage and found carpets and wood boards with spatters of blood on them. Darren Wheatcroft, left and his son Callan, right, face 16 charges in relation to a dog fighting investigation . The Wheatcrofts appeared at Hyndburn magistrates' court along with family friend Simon Whitworth, front . Details of the investigation emerged at Hyndburn magistrates court in Accrington where a father and son and a family friend faced a total of 16 charges including causing a dog fight to take place. Darren Wheatcroft, 47 and his son Callan, 21, who live together at Accrington, are accused of keeping and training three bull terrier type dogs for use in connection with an animal fight, and having various implements, designed or adapted for use in a dogfight. They are further accused of causing an animal fight to take place. Simon Whitworth, 33, of Oswaldtwistle is charged with causing unnecessary suffering to four bull terrier type dogs named Sheba, Beauty, Dingo and Bebo by failing to ensure they were treated by a vet after being injured. He is also charged with having a dangerous dog, possessing implements designed or adapted for use in connection with an animal fight and keep premises for use for an animal fight. All three suspects deny the charges and face a trial later this year in which 29 witnesses are expected to be called to testify. Prosecutor Chris Wyatt told the hearing said RSPCA officers found various dogs during raids on the homes of Whitworth and the Wheatcrofts. He added: 'There are six dogs mentioned in these proceedings, five of which following a seizure were found to be Pit Bull dogs and banned by the Dangerous Dog Act. The team found possession of items used in dog fighting. A tread mill was found which is used for training dogs. 'This is not like you see in a gym. It is a manual one. There were syringes and scalpels. This is stuff you would not expect to find in a normal persons house.' Two of the dogs were at Mr Whitworth premises. One had injury to its ear. The other had an injury to its front left leg. One of the offences alleged against the Wheatcrofts is that they were involved in the arrangement of dog fights due to messages seized from electronic devices. Whitworth is accused of keeping a premises used for animal fighting. When the team entered the property they found carpets and wood boards with splatters of blood on. It all adds up to being used for animal fighting. But defence lawyer Alex Rostron acting for all three men told the hearing: 'They have not been training dogs to fight. They say they play no part in that because they did not arrange any dog fights. They are not training them and not fighting them.' All three men were bailed pending a preliminary hearing at Burnley magistrates court next month.

"Samsung may be considered Apple’s biggest rival, but a Chinese firm wants to steal this crown. Xiaomi has announced its next-generation flagship phablet - called Mi Note - and said it is larger, thinner, lighter and cheaper than Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus. During the launch event, the firm also poked fun at Apple’s raised camera. Scroll down for video . The Mi Note from Chinese firm Xiaomi has a 5.7-inch display, is 6.95mm thick and weighs 161g. This makes it 0.2-inches larger, 0.15mm thinner and 11 lighter than Apple's iPhone 6 Plus (comparison pictured) In December, four-year-old Xiaomi became the world’s most valuable startup. It has been criticised in the past for producing phones that are similar to Apple’s range of handsets, leading to the company being dubbed the ‘Apple of China’. At Xiaomi’s press conference to announce the Mi Note, the firm made regular and direct comparisons to the iPhone 6 Plus, including placing the two phones side-by-side on presentation slides. For example, Xiaomi’s Mi Note has a 5.7-inch display, compared to the iPhone 6 Plus’ 5.5-inch screen. Both phones have the same screen resolution, but because Xiaomi’s is slightly bigger, it has fewer pixels per inch than Apple’s handset - 386 PPI versus 401 PPI respectively.

"A surprise decision to remove a cap on the Swiss franc sent markets into fresh turmoil today but helped the pound climb to a near-seven year high against the euro. The strength of sterling will help UK holidaymakers visiting the likes of Spain, Greece and France this year, but is not good for skiers heading to the Swiss Alps. It could also spell trouble for British firms whose goods have become more expensive for potential export customers on the continent. There were fears it could also leave a nasty taste in the mouth for chocolate lovers ahead of Easter as it could mean a price hike for the country's confectionery products. Scroll down for video . Currency shock: The Swiss central bank's move has seen the Swiss franc soar against all major currencies . Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: 'Switzerland suddenly got a whole lot more expensive and for chocolate lovers Nestle and/or Lindt chocolate just got a whole lot more expensive.' The decision by Switzerland's central bank to drop the policy capping the franc's value at no more than 1.20 euros comes a day after stocks were buffeted by a slump in the copper price, adding to ongoing anxiety about the plunge in oil. It helped sterling rise sharply against the single currency, topping the 1.30 euros mark to a level not seen since March 2008 - an increase of ten cents in the last year. The euro initially plunged by 30% against the Swiss currency before paring the loss to 13% later in the morning. Sterling was also down sharply against the franc, falling by as much as 26% in value before partially recovering to be 14% off later. The move by the Swiss central bank could see a rise the price of Swiss chocolates, like Lindt bunnies, in the coming months, experts have said . In shares, the FTSE 100 Index had a turbulent session, initially adding more than 80 points as it recovered from a copper-inspired plunge in the previous session, before falling to 90 points off its opening position, then returning to positive territory. Switzerland's central bank had introduced the cap on the franc in September 2011 to try to hold back the rise of the safe haven currency at a time when the eurozone debt crisis was at its height. Swiss exporters had at the time been forced to sharply cut prices to stay competitive. But the bank today said the policy, while having protected the economy from harm, could no longer be justified. The slide in the euro in recent months against the dollar has meant that because of the peg the franc has fallen too. Despite its strengthening currency, the Swiss stock index slumped 9% amid fears that exports will become more expensive in the wake of the decision to end the peg. Swiss-listed shares in offshore drilling contractor Transocean slumped to an all-time low, while lenders Julius Baer and UBS were down 13 percent and 11 percent respectively. Weaker equities wiped off about 117 billion Swiss francs ($100 billion) from the SMI share index. 'It is carnage, they've stopped defending the floor, I'm a seller of Europe here,' said Darren Courtney-Cook, head of trading at Central Markets Investment Management. Swatch Chief Executive Nick Hayek called the SNB's decision 'a tsunami' for Switzerland's economy. The cap has come under increasing pressure as the franc's value elsewhere has soared with investors seeking a haven in Switzerland from the eurozone's economic and political troubles. Recovery: The pound has gained steadily against the euro over the last eighteen months. Sterling made further gains against the single currency today in the wake of the Swiss announcement . The SNB has until now resisted pressure to let the franc float against the euro but the prospect of outright money-printing - which devalues a currency - by the European Central Bank as early as next week broke the bank's resolve. 'It has taken the market by complete surprise,' said Jonathan Webb, head of FX strategy at Jefferies in London. 'The SNB probably expects the ECB to launch QE next week and along with the Greek elections coming up, it would make it pretty tough on the Swiss to keep bidding the euro.' Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets added: 'The SNB must have a very strong inclination that the European Central Bank is about to begin a large scale quantitative easing program which would act to depreciate the euro and make a defence of the Swiss franc peg impossible.' Europe's shares and bond yields tumbling as jittery markets reacted negatively to the unexpected move. The FTSE 100 index fell 100 points on the news, dropping from 60 points up on the day to 40 points down at 6,347. The dollar meanwhile also lost 14 per cent of its value against the Swiss franc. 'This is extremely violent and totally unexpected, the central bank didn't prepare the market for it,' said Alexandre Baradez, chief market analyst at IG in France. 'It's sparking panic across all asset classes. It suddenly revives the risk of central bank policy mistakes, right when central bank action is what's keeping equity markets going.' The currency moves overshadowed a steadier session for commodity stocks after a sharp slide in the price of copper triggered big losses across Europe's leading stock markets on Wednesday. Hargreaves Lansdown estimates that UK fund investors have more than £4billion invested in Swiss stocks, mainly via European funds, but also perhaps more surprisingly, via UK Equity Income funds. The fund platform said Swiss drugmakers Roche and Novartis are popular fund holdings with managers in the UK Equity Income sector, who can invest up to 20 per cent of their portfolio overseas. For instance, it noted that Woodford Equity income has 3 per cent invested in Roche. Hargreaves estimates that the average European fund has 9 per cent invested in Swiss stocks, the typical European (ex-UK) tracker fund has around 20 per cent, and the average UK Equity Income fund has just under 1 per cent, though some UK Equity Income funds have closer to 5 per cent invested. However, even though the Swiss stock market has tanked today, the financial services group believes that the effect of the sharp rise in the Swiss franc has more than offset that fall. After factoring in the currency's rise against the pound, Hargreaves thanks that UK investors would on average have made around 2 per cent on their Swiss stock market holdings this morning. And UK Equity Income funds invested in Roche and Novartis would have made more, both these stocks rose about 5 per cent in sterling terms. Not bad for a morning's work. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said: 'The Swiss stock market has been decimated this morning by the central bank's decision to remove their currency peg to the Euro. However UK investors can afford a wry smile because the appreciation of the franc has made their Swiss holdings more valuable, despite the stock market plunge.'","Swiss central bank shocks world markets by unleashing exchange rate .

"The families of two teenage girls who were killed in a Maryland freight train derailment in 2012 have reached an undisclosed settlement with the railroad. On August 21, 2012, a  train derailed in Ellicott City as 19-year-olds Rose Mayr and Elizabeth Nass sat on framework next to the tracks which went over the town's Main Street. Twenty-one of the 80 rail cars overturned, and the two teenagers were buried in coal in the disaster which took place close to midnight. The girls died of asphyxiation. Friends Rose Mayr (right) and Elizabeth Nass, both 19-year-old college students, died in 2012 after being buried in coal during a train derailment in Maryland . A spokesman for the railroad, CSX Transportation, said the terms of the settlement were confidential. The settlement was reached in November. In July, federal officials found that the derailment was caused by a broken rail on a section of track being monitored because of previous problems. The families of Mayr and Nass had criticized CSX and said they were considering filing a lawsuit. Neither family could be reached for comment. Two train operators were not harmed in the derailment where cranes had to be used to remove some of the railroad cars. 'Many of those train cars fell onto automobiles, literally fell onto automobiles with the coal,' Howard County Executive Ken Ulman said at the time of the incident. 'So you have massive piles of coal and heavy train cars on top of automobiles.' Miss Nass was a student at James Madison University in Virginia and Miss Mayr was a student at the University of Delaware. Shortly before the tragedy unfolded, the two friends had posted photos and updates to their Twitter pages, one of their feet hanging off the bridge in Ellicott City, about 13 miles west of Baltimore, and another, which read: ‘Drinking on top of the Ellicott City sign.’ The girls were trespassing at the time of their deaths at a popular hang-out spot for local young people. Twenty-one of the 80 rail cars overturned, and the two teenagers were buried in coal in the disaster which took place close to midnight . Earlier, Miss Nass had tweeted: ‘Once before I leave you for school… you, me, a handle of burnett’s, and some form of public transportation.’ Ellicott City is a picturesque town where there are several bars alongside gift and antique shops in converted old buildings. The railroad runs across Main Street in Ellicott City, about 13 miles west of Baltimore. The train had two locomotives, was 3,000-feet-long and weighed 9,000 tons. About 100 pounds of coal spilled into a tributary of the Patapsco River, a major Maryland waterway that parallels the tracks, said Maryland Department of the Environment spokesman Jay Apperson in 2012. In July, federal officials found that the derailment was caused by a broken rail on a section of track .","Rose Mayr and Elizabeth Nass, both 19, were killed on August 21, 2012 in Ellicott City, Maryland .

"Countless numbers of children have marvelled at how a homemade boat made of folded paper can float on water. And now engineers have created a giant origami version that can carry an adult. Unlike the simple toy that's constructed using a single piece of paper, they also used glue and sticky tape to create the lake-worthy vessel, which measures (12feet) 3.6 metres long. Scroll down for video . Engineers have created a giant origami version that can carry an adult (pictured). Unlike the small handmade boats crafted from a single piece of folded paper, the giant version was made using glue and sticky tap to make the lake-worthy vessel, which measures (12ft) 3.6 metres long . Weighing in at 220 lbs (100kg) and measuring six feet (two metres) wide, the boat was made from 305 feet (93 metres) of paper measuring three feet (1.1 metres wide) – the length of a football pitch – as well as 492 feet (150 metres) of sticky tape and two gallons (10 litres) of glue, to keep it waterproof. Engineers selected paper that is stronger and more water-resistant than usual, because the boat was to be in the water for much longer than a normal small-scale version. They also made modifications to the traditional design.

Ridged paper in the base of the boat created a platform strong enough for someone to stand on. Pupils from Tottenham UTC school helped to launched the giant paper construction on Southwark Boating Lake in South London to mark the 50 day countdown to the annual Big Bang Fair, which promotes careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The project was intended to show them that even the humble paper boat can be super-sized using engineering techniques capable of making it strong enough for a human. Morwenna Wilson, an award-winning engineer who is a direct descendent of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, captained the boat on its maiden voyage. The craft stayed in the water for two hours and is still intact, despite having a soggy bottom - but no-one is sure exactly how long it could survive. It is said to have 'handled like a dream'.

Ms Wilson works as a mechanical engineer for Argent, London and is currently leading several major projects at London King’s Cross Railway Station. ‘Engineering runs in my family, and I really want to show young people that this career can open doors to amazing opportunities and adventures,’ she said. ‘From creating a huge origami boat, constructing a new skyscraper, or designing an aeroplane, so many things we travel on, live in or use in our everyday lives involve engineering.’ Year 10 pupil Daniella Jennings, 15, from Tottenham UTC, London said: ‘It was cool to see how they managed to make a huge version of the kind of paper boats you can make at home. I didn’t even realise that was something engineers could do!’ Similar stunts will feature at the Big Bang UK Young Scientists & Engineers Fair, which will take place at NEC, Birmingham from 11-14 March 2015. There are also instructions of how to make a small scale version of the origami boat. To ensure it didn’t capsize, a keel of wood was added underneath the boat, while a polystyrene block supporting the pyramid of paper was added for safety. These modifications kept Ms Wilson (pictured) dry .","Paper boat was reinforced with glue and 492 ft (150 metres) of sticky tape .

"Former Formula One boss Max Mosley, pictured outside court yesterday, has won his latest round of his ongoing legal battle against Google . Former Formula One boss Max Mosley has won his latest round of his ongoing legal battle against Google after the High Court refused to block his claim for damages over 'sex orgy' pictures. Mosley, 74, is seeking damages from Google UK and parent company Google Inc, and an injunction banning the publication of the photographs on the search engine. He has brought a claim against US-based Google Inc and Google UK under the Data Protection Act and against Google Inc for misuse of private information. Google's lawyers said that his case is unsustainable in fact and law and should be struck out. They also argued that permission to serve the claim on Google Inc outside the jurisdiction of the court should be set aside. But Mr Justice Mitting said today that the claim brought against US-based Google Inc under the Data Protection Act should continue. He said: 'On the contrary, it seems to me to be a viable claim which raises questions of general public interest which ought to proceed to trial.' The litigation follows Mosley's 2008 privacy victory against the now-defunct News Of The World newspaper when he won £60,000 compensation after it accused him of taking part in a 'sick Nazi orgy' with five prostitutes. Mosley, the son of the 1930s Fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley, did not dispute taking part in the sadomasochistic roleplay at a rented Chelsea basement flat, but said it was consensual and private, with no Nazi overtones. He said that his life had been devastated by the March 2008 expose and by the newspaper putting secretly-filmed footage on its website, which attracted at least 3.5 million hits. Mosley has campaigned for privacy ever since his unusual sexual tastes were exposed, backing pressure group Hacked Off and giving evidence in the Leveson Enquiry. He has also been successful in legal bids to stop Google from directing users to images of the orgy via the French and German courts. Scroll down for video . Mr Justice Mitting yesterday said damages ‘may simply not be available’ to Mosley but said some form of injunction banning the images could be ‘much less problematic’. Today he ruled there is jurisdiction for Mosley’s claim and ordered the case to go to trial at London’s High Court. After the hearing, Mr Mosley said: 'I am very pleased with the result. 'What is important is that they are now going to have to come in front of the courts in the UK, where they do an enormous amount of business, to seek to justify their conduct. 'The only thing I regret is that it was necessary to have a hearing in the High Court in order to get them to do this.' Mosley, 74, is seeking damages from Google UK (pictured) and parent company Google Inc, and an injunction banning the publication of the photographs on the search engine . Speaking today, the judge said: ‘A judicial remedy is available. The claimant clearly has a legal benefit which the court may grant and what the claimant requires amounts to general monitoring. ‘Existing technology permits Google to block images as it does with views of child pornography. ‘The claimant has a viable case and it seems to me to be a claim of viable public interest which ought to proceed to trial.’ Google fiercely contest Mosley’s claims, believing any form of filter on searches could amount to censorship of the web. Analysing the role of internet search engines, Mr Justice Mitting said ‘about 60 trillion’ web pages are posted onto the internet each year. The judge, sitting at the High Court in London (pictured), said that Mosley 'plainly has a legal remedy, which the court may grant'. He added: ‘A person searching for an image will click on a thumbnail of the image. A smaller version of the image on the website will be seen and stored inside a cache. ‘All this is done automatically. Google has no control over this, when a user types in searches thumbnails will be displaying they see then come into view. The order is established by an algorithm.’ Around 435,000 people viewed the photos and around 1.5 million had seen the video footage immediately after publication, the court heard earlier. The judge, who was told that Mosley’s action against Google UK under the Data Protection Act had been discontinued, went on to stay Mosley's damages claim against Google Inc for misuse of private information, which he had described as 'deeply problematic'. The remaining action concerns Mosley's bid to obtain an order requiring the search engine to cease processing the images. Google's counsel, Antony White QC, said that it had used its notice and takedown procedures to block images when specific URLs had been provided because, whatever the strict legal position, it had some sympathy for Mosley and wished to avoid a dispute. But, Mosley's counsel, Hugh Tomlinson QC, said he had been forced to engage in what a Canadian court had described as an 'endless game of 'whack-a-mole''. This was despite the fact that it was possible - as Google now accepted - for the search engine to take technical steps to prevent the images being indexed by Google Search in the first place. The judge said that Mosley 'plainly has a legal remedy, which the court may grant'.

"An increasing number of shops in Britain have decided to stock the new issue of Charlie Hebdo in a show of support for the victims of last week's Paris terror attacks. The latest outlets to stock the satirical magazine, which features a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed on its front cover, are a fancy dress shop and a news kiosk. One shopkeeper said it is 'the right thing to do' to sell the magazine in support of free speech, while another said the publication had 'caught the imagination of the world'. Scroll down for video . On sale: Jon Powell, left, and Matthew Stephenson, right, are two of the British shopkeepers who are planning to sell the new issue of Charlie Hebdo . Clamour: The latest issue of Charlie Hebdo, produced one week after many of its editorial staff were murdered, reportedly sold out across France within minutes . The magazine was first published in France yesterday, just a week after jihadi terrorists stormed the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris and killed 12 people, including the editor. Its initial print run sold out within hours as potential buyers queued up in the streets, and it is expected to sell a total of 5million copies. The first copies destined for Britain are due to arrive tomorrow, and a number of shopkeepers have already announced that they will make the magazine available even though they don't usually stock it. Jon Powell, who runs a kiosk selling newspapers and magazines, said he would sell a limited number of magazines on a first-come, first-served basis. And even though the new issue has apparently been fetching hundreds of pounds on eBay, he has vowed not to charge more than the the face value of €3 (around £2.30). Memorial: A journalist holds an early copy of the first edition of Charlie Hebdo since the slaughter in its office . 'I'm a little bit concerned about the reaction, but if it's perfectly legal to sell them, we'll sell them,' Mr Powell, 36, said. 'Some of the magazines offend different people for different reasons but we live in a free society. 'It was a big call to make to publicise it, but it was the right thing to do. I have sympathy for the people who make the magazine.' He added: 'I got the magazine in in response to customers calling first thing to get a copy. 'I phoned the wholesalers and put my name down for a couple of copies and if there were a few extra. 'After I put it out there on social media the phone has been ringing red hot and demand shot up to 30 copies. 'I know some are up on eBay but I will be selling them at face value. I'm providing the news that people want and I wouldn't want to make money on the back of misfortune.' Emotional: Charlie Hebdo's new editor Gerard Biard (left) and journalist Patrick Pelloux (right) comfort the cover's cartoonist Luz (centre) during a press conference on Tuesday at which they vowed to continue . Matthew Stephenson, the owner of a fancy dress shop, said that he would sell 100 copies of Charlie Hebdo. 'The magazine has caught the imagination of the world,' the 43-year-old said. 'I have managed to get 100 copies to collect at 7am on Friday. 'Lots of customers have shown an interest in buying a copy. I believe they are as curious as I am to see it.' There is a huge rush for copies of the 'Survivors' edition of Charlie Hebdo in Britain - but there is confusion about how many will be available. The French satirical magazine usually sells around 30 copies a week in Britain. But distributors hope they will be able to get their hands on 2,000 copies, which are likely to arrive from Friday - two days after it went on sale in France. The UK copies are being distributed by newspaper and magazine wholesalers Smiths News and Menzies Distribution - Britain's biggest suppliers. But they have also admitted they are still unsure how many they will get because Charlie Hebdo sold out in France this morning - meaning there may not be any to sell. London is likely to have the majority of copies from Friday, because it has up to 400,000 French people living there. Larger stores like WH Smith have ruled out selling but smaller foreign book stores and newsagents will. One, the French Bookshop in South Kensington, said: 'We will be selling it on a first come, first served basis when we get it'. Another unnamed retailer told MailOnline they would like to sell it but are not hopeful they will be able to get any copies. Another British newsagent was seen selling copies of the magazine which had apparently been photocopied, according to Press Gazette. He was charging £9 for the counterfeit publications, but still managed to sell 70 copies. It emerged yesterday that a village shopkeeper who announced that she would be selling the new Charlie Hebdo had run out of her 200 copies before they were even delivered to her. Only around 2,000 copies are being imported into the UK, sparking a huge rush on eBay. One auction saw bidding hit £100,000, but the sale is believed to have been sabotaged. At an emotional press conference on Tuesday, members of staff at Charlie Hebdo vowed not to censor the magazine despite the horrific massacre which left many of their colleagues dead. The new front cover features the headline 'All is forgiven' over a tearful Mohammed holding a sign reading 'Je suis Charlie', the slogan that has become a rallying cry for those appalled by the massacre. The image was the work of cartoonist Renald 'Luz' Luzier, who survived the killings because he was late for work that day. The magazine also includes cartoons mocking the two killers, brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi. Some British Muslims have spoken out against the decision to run a cartoon of Mohammed, claiming that it is a provocative move which could further inflame tensions. Labour MP Khalid Mahmood urged newspapers and broadcasters not to show the images, saying: 'These cartoons are not satire, they are not in good taste - they are just offensive.' However, David Cameron said: 'When your freedom of expression is attacked in this way, I don't think it's surprising that people want to stand up and fight for that freedom of expression they believe in.'","News kiosk owner is taking a stand by selling the magazine's new issue .

"'Pill Mills' dishing out pain killers at an alarming rate . Prescription drug abusers up by nearly 1 million from 08 to 09 . 2.5 million more Americans used illegal narcotics in 09 than 08 . U.S. is the biggest 'importer' of illicit drugs worldwide . Over 16 million Americans - a shocking 6.4 per cent of the population - regularly abuse prescription drugs, a UN survey has found. According to the UN report, the abuse of prescription drugs is the fastest-growing drug related problem in the country - with the number of addicts far outstripping those who use cocaine. The annual UN International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) report found that the 'non-medical' use of pain relievers, tranquillizers, stimulants and sedatives had risen  from 15.2 million in 2008 to 16 million in 2009. Legal drugs: The rise in addiction to prescription drugs alarmed UN researchers . It was also revealed that among those who received opium based pain relief, the number who were subsequently treated for the abuse of pain relievers more than tripled from 1998 to 2008, reaching 26.5 per cent, the report found. And between 2007 to 2009, the percentage of state and local . law enforcement agencies reporting prescription . drugs as the greatest drug-related threat to their areas more than doubled. At the same time the number of Americans who use cocaine fell from 5.3 million in 2008 to 4.8 million in 2009. Trouble: OxyContin is one of the main culprits in the prescription drug addiction boom . The fall was attributed to a number of factors including, crucially, less cocaine abuse, decreased illicit cocaine manufacture in Colombia and sustained pressure on drug trafficking organisations in Mexico. The INCB report is an annual worldwide survey of drug production, consumption and distribution by the UN drug agency. The shocking figures come after fears that 'pill-mills' - clinics that illegally or carelessly issue prescription pain killers - continue to feed addiction in the U.S. Only last month, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement  said the illegal abuse of prescription drugs is Florida’s 'greatest public . health threat.' It was reported that there were 1,167 registered pain clinics in the state compared to 860 McDonald's restaurants. The agency added that seven people die in Florida state every day due to prescription drug abuse. Speaking yesterday, newly appointed House Appropriations Committee . chairman Hal Rogers said the Justice Department had not been doing . enough to stop the flow of illegally obtained prescription drugs. He said: 'It's an absolute disgrace' with so many people involved in . the illicit trade flying back and forth to Florida that 'they call it . the OxyContin Express. 'Crook doctors operating these pill mills' are out of control.' OxyContin is a prescription medication used to relieve moderate to severe pain. It is one of the main prescription drugs that users become addicted to. Last year it was reported that U.S. prescription drug sales climbed . by 5.1 percent to $300.3 billion in 2009 - dwarfing the meagre 1.5 per cent . rise the year before. The prescription drugs involved are primarily opium derived pain . relievers containing codeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine, . oxycodone, dextropropoxyphene, methadone or hydrocodone. Aside from the prescription drug problem, the U.N. survey found that the United States continued to be the main country of destination for illicit drug shipments. Drop: Cocaine abuse has fallen at the same time prescription drug abuse has risen . It said: 'In 2009 the number of drug-related deaths increased sharply in the United States. 'The Board is also deeply concerned about the fact that the United States recorded for 2009 an increase in the abuse of all drugs except cocaine.' According to the results an estimated 38 million people, 15.1 per cent of the population used illicit drugs in 2009. That represents an increase of 2.5 million people from 2008 and a reversal of the declining trend in illicit drug use in the preceding years. Investigators added that they were concerned by the increasing number of young people using cannabis and prescription drugs containing controlled substances. The report added it was: 'Deeply concerned about 'medical' cannabis schemes, which so far have been introduced in 14 states in the United States. 'The control measures applied in those states to the cultivation of cannabis plants and the production, distribution and use of cannabis fall short of the control requirements.' The news comes as the Food and Drug Administration said today it will . remove around 500 unapproved cold and allergy medications from the . market as part of an ongoing crackdown on ineffective prescription . drugs. The FDA requires companies to submit all new prescription drugs for scientific review before they are launched. However, thousands of drugs actually pre-date the FDA's drug regulations and have escaped scrutiny for decades. Most of the drugs targeted by the latest action are pills using . untested combinations of decongestant and cough-suppressing ingredients. Anna Nicole Smith . Died: February 8, 2007 .

"British holidaymakers are looking to alternative ski destinations after the Alps experienced one of the worst starts to a season in living memory, a new study suggests. Online searches for destinations in Norway have soared while queries for traditional getaways in France have plummeted by more than half, according to travel website Kayak. The sudden interest in Norwegian resorts reflects the perfect conditions at the country’s ski runs. Scroll down for video . A study by Kayak suggests that interest in Norwegian ski resorts has soared after the Alps' slow start . Year-over-year increase in searches: . Year-over-year decrease in searches: . Nearly all of Norway’s pistes are open with a snow depth of more than 45in on the summit and 40in at the base of the slope. Kayak said searches for flights going to Kristiansund Airport have doubled over last year, while searches for Chambery Airport in the French Alps have decreased by 56 per cent. Until a blizzard hit in late December – stranding thousands of holidaymakers – France's top skiing destinations were mostly void of snow and openings were delayed at resorts where slopes were bare. Kayak said searches for flights going to Kristiansund Airport in Norway have doubled over last year . It came after a spell of unseasonably warm weather that was responsible for one of the ‘least snowy’ winters in the French Alps in 35 years. Kayak said Denver, Calgary, Helsinki and Vancouver airports – all located near popular skiing destinations – have also seen a surge of interest. In comparison searches to all five of the Alps’ main airports, including Chambery, are down, according to the travel website.

"Ford are 'looking into' the allegations . Ford motor company is facing accusations workers at a factory producing parts for its cars are subject to abusive and dangerous working conditions, a report said. According to the National Labor Committee (NLC), Chinese workers at the Yuwei Plastics and Hardware Product Company in Dongguan work 14-hour days, seven days a week for just 80 cents an hour. Shockingly, the report also alleges workers are forced to operate dangerous machines with safety measures turned off in order to speed up production. Report: Ford Motor Company is looking into a graphic report by a human rights group alleging abuse of workers at a Chinese factory. This man's hand was mangled, allegedly by a machine at the factory . Factory: The report said the factory made 80 per cent of its parts for Ford . The report - 'Dirty Parts/Where Lost Fingers Come Cheap: Ford in China' - alleges a litany of abuses at the factory including a number of horrific injuries caused by deliberate safety short cuts. One man named in the report, called Worker 'A' for his own protection, had three fingers and several knuckles torn from his left hand when it was trapped in a powerful punch press. The 21-year-old told the NLC that  bosses at the factory told him to turn off an infra-red safety monitor device so he could work faster. The monitoring . device was designed to shut the machine off if a worker's hand . went into the danger zone. The worker, who  'stamps' out 3,600 pieces a day, said: 'Some of the small parts could not be done with the infra-red monitoring on. 'We had to turn it off. My boss did not let me turn it on.' Investigation: In a statement Ford said they were looking into the allegations . The Yuwei Plastics plant produces gear shifters and other small auto parts for . a number of international car companies including Volkswagen and GM - . although 80 per cent of their output is bought by Ford, the report . alleges. On its website the NLC says it reports on global workers rights and aims to, 'help defend the human rights of workers in the global economy.' The report cited at least four other serious injuries involving maimed hands and fingers over several years. 'Minor' injuries, the report concludes, occur every one or two months - with seriously injured workers being 'fired after a year or two'. Worker 'A' was said to have received only $7,430 in compensation for the loss of three fingers, leaving his hand basically inoperative. The report compares this to the estimated $144,292 payment a U.S. worker would receive for the same injury. Conditions: Safety equipment was said to have been turned off on dangerous machines so workers could produce more parts in less time . It was also reported that workers earned a base wage of just 80 cents an hour, while working 14-hour shifts, seven days a week. The accusations echo a similar controversy faced by computer maker Apple and one of its suppliers. Taiwan-based Foxconn, who manufacture parts for the iphone, suffered a spate of 10 suicides at its factory in Shenzhen, China, last year. Poor working and boarding conditions along with an overworked labour force were blamed for the worker deaths. A Ford spokesman said: 'We take these allegations seriously and are investigating the situation. 'Ford has a strong commitment to human rights and workplace safety, . and we expect our suppliers to comply with local laws and our Code of . Basic Working Conditions.' He added that the company was still trying to determine if the . Yuwei factory was one its 1,500 direct suppliers or one of thousands of . indirect suppliers around the world.",Ford are 'looking into' the allegations .
"Guinness World Records keepers estimated the odds of it happening were 17.7 billion to 1. And come February 20 each year, there are a lot of cakes inside the Cummins house in Virginia. That's because it's the birthday of five of the family's children. The running joke among parents Ralph and Carolyn Cummins is that Ralph, a football coach inducted into the National High School Sports Hall of Fame, 'wasn’t so preoccupied' in June. It is also the month of their wedding anniversary, according to Times Dispatch. Catherine, Carol, Charles, Claudia and Cecilia were all born on February 20 but in different years. Happy birthday to us! (Clockwise fom left) Cecilia Cummins-Lasyone, Charles Cummins, Claudia Cummins-Knapp, Christopher Cummins, Catherine Cummins, Cheryl Cummins (seated on right)  and Carol Cummins Morley (seated on left). Catherine, Carol, Charles, Claudia and Cecilia were all born on February 20 . Children of Ralph and Carolyn Cummins (seated) are (from left) Cecilia Cummins-Lasyone, Claudia Cummins-Knapp, Chris Cummins, Charles Cummins, Catherine Cummins, Cheryl Cummins, Carol Cummins-Morley and Catherine Cummins . Proud parents: Ralph and Carolyn Cummins . The family was entered into the 1977 Guinness World Records as 'the only verified record of a family producing five single children with the same date of birth'. The record-keepers in 1977 estimated odds of that happening were 17.7 billion to 1. Cheryl, 59, who has lived in the Richmond area for more than 25 years, makes sure everyone knows about her family’s oddity every Feb. 20. 'I love it when the birthdays come around because no one believes it,' she said. Guinness World Records doesn’t feature their family in every edition, so she carries a 2003 copy to show doubters. It’s been several years since they have all been together for the big day, but a round of phone calls and a stack of mailed birthday cards are customary. The years Carolyn wasn’t in labor, she came home early from work every Feb. 19 and baked and decorated cakes all afternoon — a football field for Charles, the dress of a doll with a doll standing on top for Claudia, roses for Catherine, and many more. One year, she made cakes with clock faces displaying the time each of the children was born on their respective Feb. 20. The family was entered into the 1977 Guinness World Records as 'the only verified record of a family producing five single children with the same date of birth' Even when the older girls left for college, Carolyn made a birthday cake for them and stuck it in the freezer, awaiting the day they came home from spring break. 'She just really made it special,' Claudia said. 'It was so cool that she had that mother’s instinct to make sure everyone was OK and have all our individual needs met.' The true record-holders — Ralph and Carolyn Cummins — could not be reached Thursday night in between their rounds of birthday phone calls from their Florida winter home. The birthday record is nothing more than a display of the family’s values, Cheryl said. 'We believe in togetherness in my family,' she said. At the end of the day, though, Catherine jokes: 'I led the way. It’s really my birthday.'","February 20 is the birthday for five of the seven children in Cummins family .

"Police to question mother and stepfather today . Parents are accused of hiding information from police . Missing girl had two separate Facebook accounts . A 13-year-old schoolgirl who was missing for more than a week ran away because she was terrified by her mother and stepfather's alleged plot to send her to Pakistan for an arranged marriage, police claimed today. Jessie Bender's parents are accused of keeping their plan secret from detectives after reporting that she had disappeared from their California home.

'There was something to that effect in the works and the daughter was scared. 'She was found with the uncle who was protecting her from the parents,' said Ms Walker. Detective Gerald Davenport was carrying out interviews today to determine whether the parents will face prosecution. One line of inquiry is whether there was any intention to involve Jessie in an arranged marriage in Pakistan while she was under age. Police also slammed the Bender family for 'misleading' them over Jessie's disappearance, wasting time and resources. Mrs Walker added: ‘Bender family members misled detectives and withheld critical . information and as a result delayed the investigation and recovery of . their daughter Jessie Bender.' Jessie's family had reported her missing on February 22. They told . police they feared she had been abducted by a man she met on Facebook. It later emerged her mother Melissa admitted to police that the family were set to go on a two-month trip to Pakistan on February 23. She confessed her daughter had been upset about having to go on the trip - but insisted 'she was fine with it', and said nothing about an arranged marriage. Instead she claimed a man her daughter met on Facebook may have been to blame for her disappearance. In a televised appeal, Mrs Bender said: ‘He was the last person she spoke to at 1:47 in the morning. 'I was told by her school mates that this boy was an influence on her.'

He said: 'I just told him to please send her back because otherwise you are gonna get arrested by the cops. 'They are gonna be on you any time.' 'He told us he don't have her and he would contact us when he heard from her. 'I don't believe on him.' The Bender family's claim sparked a kidnapping investigation involving the FBI. The massive search also involved detectives from the . Los Angeles Police Department and Chicago Police Department, and agents . with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Fox News reported that Mrs Bender claimed during the investigation that her daughter was on medication and did not have any with her, sparking even more fears for her safety.

Investigators pored through mobile phone records and computer data, and interviewed all of Jessie's friends. But as they came up with nothing, their suspicions grew that Jessie's disappearance had nothing to do with a Facebook friend. Then a relative, now known to be an uncle, led police to the Apple Valley hotel where Jessie was hiding, and the real reason for her disappearance was revealed. It is not clear what relatives Jessie has in Pakistan although it is believed her stepfather Mr Kahn may have connections there. Search: One of the missing posters handed out during the investigation into Jessie's disappearance . Jessie . and her three siblings have been taken to child protective custody by . county social services, and no arrests have been made. Mrs Bender insisted to the Hesperia Star that her daughter had not fled because of the trip to Pakistan. ‘She didn’t really want to go but she was fine with it,’ she told the newspaper. ‘I really don’t think the trip played a role in her leaving. She was actually excited to go shopping for the trip. 'I even asked her friends and they said she wasn’t upset about going so I really don’t think that was the reason.’","Police to question mother and stepfather today .
