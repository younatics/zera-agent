"(CNN)The film community is coming together in a touching way to honor one of their own who died on a movie set. Sarah Elizabeth Jones, a 27-year-old camera assistant, was on the set of musician Gregg Allman's biopic ""Midnight Rider"" when she was struck and killed by a freight train near Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday. 'Midnight Rider' production halted after crew member death . Her death rocked the local film community, leaving many questioning who was to blame for the accident. A group of friends set up a Facebook page on Monday in tribute to Jones with a simple call to action: ""Sarah Elizabeth Jones, friend and family to so many, made every day awesome. Show your slate love here along with all the good stories of her life."" Film crew members from various countries immediately began sharing photo tributes, holding clapboards with messages of remembrance for her. It's become a movement with hundreds of images shared on the Facebook group Slates for Sarah, which was created on Monday. As of Sunday night, more than 63,000 people had liked the page. It's a fitting tribute, as Jones' primary job on set was to operate the slate at the beginning of each take. Jones, an Atlanta resident and member of the International Cinematographers Guild, used her ""spunk and determination"" to climb up in the industry, according to her obituary. The word about the tribute is spreading through her comrades, the behind-the-scenes workers in the industry. Her friends and co-workers also did the near-impossible: They got the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to add Jones' name to the In Memoriam list displayed during the Oscars this weekend; Jones was included in a graphic at the end of the segment. How the Oscar 'in memoriam' segment is decided . Eric Henson, one of the people who helped start Slates for Sarah, worked in the camera department with Jones on two seasons of ""The Vampire Diaries,"" as well as a few movies. The two became friends after meeting on set five years ago, when Jones moved to Atlanta, he said. Henson was on the set of ""The Vampire Diaries"" when the crew learned about her death, just hours after it had happened. He said the producer wrapped after they heard the news. Buses of crew members from ""Vampire Diaries"" and other productions filming in Georgia were on their way to Jones' memorial in Columbia, South Carolina, on Wednesday afternoon. Jones was a native of West Columbia. ""We were all devastated,"" Henson said. ""The beautiful thing about this kind of work is that you spend 12 to 13 hours a day with someone, and it becomes a family situation. Something like this happens and you see how close knit we all are."" When Henson and a group of Jones' friends saw a few people posting clapboards in honor of her, they decided to create a page to house all of the memories and messages for Jones. He and others have been trading off shifts to post photos and respond to the outpouring of supporters. ""I've had a lot of people saying, 'I haven't seen something like this in 30 to 40 years in the film industry,'"" Henson said. ""The solidarity of people coming together has really been incredible."" Jones' death has also been a wake-up call to the community, launching discussions about changing the industry. ""That's part of what Slates for Sarah has become,"" he said. ""It's a really tragic situation, but it's given us an opportunity to look at how we make films and how to make it a safer environment."" Jones and others were filming on train tracks at the time of the accident, according to a police report from the Wayne County Sheriff's Office. Jones died and seven others were injured during the accident. Gregg Allman, the focus of the movie Jones was working on, shared his condolences. ""I am so terribly saddened by the news of the tragedy that took the young life of Sarah Elizabeth Jones on the film set,"" he wrote on his website Saturday. ""My thoughts and prayers go out to her family, friends and colleagues during this time of mourning."" Actors who worked on set with her, notably stars from ""The Vampire Diaries,"" as well as crew members from TV shows ""Glee,"" ""Scandal"" and ""Downton Abbey,"" are among the hundreds who have shared messages of ""RIP Sarah Jones."" Even people who had never met Jones were moved to share their own tributes from places as far away as South Africa, Israel and Germany. Members of cinematography crews also shared messages of peace and love, saying ""your death will not be in vain."" ""From the heights of the mountains she hiked, to the depths of the oceans she dove (and never without a camera to record her experiences), the gift of her presence was felt far and wide,"" read Jones' obituary. Jones' life has touched hundreds in the industry, as seen through the outpouring of the Slates for Sarah movement. It's a legacy her friends are proud of. ""We're all extremely sad but all really proud that Sarah can have this kind of effect on everyone,"" said Henson.","The film industry is remembering a camera assistant who died on set .

"Juan Andres Palese says he's a frustrated entrepreneur. His business, the sale of products for growing and processing marijuana, has always been in a legal limbo in Uruguay, his country. Legally speaking, it's a complicated and risky situation. Selling accessories for the cultivation of cannabis is legal, but the production, sale and distribution of marijuana are not. ""It would be fantastic,"" Palese says, ""if we could also have access to the market of consumers."" The dream of the Montevideo resident is about to come true. The Uruguayan Senate is scheduled to vote Tuesday on a controversial bill that would make the small South American country the first in Latin America to legalize marijuana. The bill was approved by the lower house of parliament in July with 50 out of 96 votes. It also has the support of President Jose Mujica. The bill has generated international headlines because, if approved, the Uruguayan government would have the authority to regulate the production, distribution and sale of marijuana. The legislation also has the support of the Broad Front, Mujica's party. Approval is widely expected. ""More than anything, it's going to give me peace about growing what I like, which is marijuana. That's what I like to consume. It would give me the peace of mind of not having legal troubles for something that should not be illegal,"" Palese says. The bill rests on the premise that if ""the state assumes the control and regulation of the activities of importation and exportation, sowing, growing, harvesting, producing ... storing, commercializing and distributing,"" then the ills of drug trafficking would be greatly reduced and the quality of the plants improved, benefiting patients and putting drug traffickers out of business. The bill would allow individuals to grow up to six plants of marijuana and possess as much as 480 grams for personal use. Marijuana clubs of anywhere from 15 to 45 members would also be allowed and granted permission to grow up to 99 plants at a time. Users would have to register, and those claiming to use cannabis for medical reasons would have to show a doctor's prescription.  Marijuana would also be sold at licensed pharmacies. But many in the traditionally Catholic country of 3.3 million people feel legislators are espousing the wrong policy for the wrong reasons. Alfredo Solari, an opposition senator from the Colorado Party, says making marijuana widely available has the potential to create even higher levels of addiction. ""It's a very bad piece of legislation, mainly because it increases the availability of marijuana in the market. There will be a legal market that can be accessed by most Uruguayans. But there will also be a parallel illegal market for all of those who can't get marijuana legally,"" Solari said. Proponents of the bill say the legislation addresses some of the concerns expressed by the opposition. For one, violators of the law would face sentences of 20 months to 10 years in prison. Those younger than 18 would not be allowed to use marijuana under any circumstances. The legislation also calls for mandatory classes in public schools aimed at drug prevention, and advertising of cannabis in any form would be strictly forbidden. Luis Gallo, a senator with the Broad Front Party, which supports the bill, said current drug policy, which rests solely on law enforcement and prohibition, has produced no results. ""This is about regulating drugs. It's doesn't mean that it's a free-for-all, but it doesn't mean prohibition either. It means regulation has to work to reduce the risks and harmful effects of drug consumption,"" Gallo said. In an interview with CNN en Espanol, Mujica suggested in September that when it comes to drug trafficking, the trafficking part is usually more harmful than the drug itself, especially when it comes to marijuana. ""We would like to identify those who consume (marijuana), take them out of the shadows and offer to them a regulated opportunity to consume (the drug) so that they don't have to depend on drug traffickers. We want to take away the market from drug traffickers by competing with them,"" Mujica said. Supporters of the bill launched a national campaign called ""Responsible Regulation."" The campaign produced public service announcements in which a doctor, a mother and an attorney suggest it makes sense for Uruguayans to support the law. Once the bill gains approval, there will be a 120-day period to give the government time to adopt regulations to implement the law.","Bill to legalize pot widely expected to pass in Tuesday vote .
It would give Uruguayan government authority to regulate production and distribution .
Supporters say it will put drug traffickers out of business .
Opponents say it's dangerous because it will make more marijuana available ."
"(CareerBuilder) -- Just because icons like Albert Einstein and Thomas Edison aren't alive today, doesn't mean their leadership lessons should be forgotten. And since history always repeats itself, there is some career advice that never seems to change. Here, we take a look at the leadership philosophies of iconic leaders and how they can help you get ahead in your own career. ""There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work and learning from failure.""  -- Colin Powell . Career lesson: When it comes to your career, it's impossible to take the easy way out. Most of those who've found success don't have some secret connections that have helped them get ahead. Moving up in a company or building a business is always done the old-fashioned way -- by striving to do your best. ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.""  -- Thomas Edison . Career lesson: Not everyone gets it right 100 percent of the time, and the ability to rebound from career mistakes is just as important as getting it right the first time around. Companies are most interested in workers who can work through problems instead of giving up. ""Logic will get you from A to Z; imagination will get you everywhere.""  -- Albert Einstein . Career lesson: These days, innovation is a buzzword, and knowing how to think outside the box is a valuable skill. Companies aren't simply looking to hire clones, so understanding how to differentiate yourself in a corporate environment is a plus. ""Finish every day and be done with it. You have done what you could; some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; you shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense.""  -- Ralph Waldo Emerson . Career lesson: There's never a perfect day at work, and dwelling on past mistakes or having a negative attitude can prevent you from making progress. Remember that most of your superiors and managers have erred in the past but somehow managed to score that promotion. ""Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.""  -- Confucius . Career lesson: Just because a specific career is associated with a high salary or is in demand doesn't mean you should pursue it. Picking a profession you're genuinely interested in always makes it simpler to enjoy your work. ""Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great.""  -- Mark Twain . Career lesson: Finding great mentors and avoiding those who don't believe in you is a must as you start your career. Whether it's a bullying boss, a jealous co-worker or an unsupportive classmate -- there's never a reason to be weighed down by negative opinions. ""The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.""  -- Theodore Roosevelt . Career lesson: Put your all in to your career -- sometimes you will fail, and sometimes you will succeed beyond what you could have imagined. Take risks, make sacrifices, learn from your mistakes and keep going. ""Every now and then go away and have a little relaxation. To remain constantly at work will diminish your judgment. Go some distance away, because work will be in perspective and a lack of harmony is more ready seen.""  -- Leonardo DaVinci . Career lesson: Sometimes, taking a break is just as important as working hard. Getting burned out will be a lot worse for your productivity than simply stepping back once in while.

"Why return to a favorite story 25 years after it began? For author Neil Gaiman, the answer lies in one word: ""joy."" In speaking with CNN, Gaiman used the word more than once to describe his experience with ""The Sandman,"" the comic book series that started in 1988 and achieved widespread acclaim, originally ending in 1996. The story was a revolutionary reboot of a superhero character from the 1970s. Gaiman was given free rein at the time to make him completely different and ran with it. Now, Gaiman is back with the new series ""Sandman: Overture,"" and the second issue is set for release on Wednesday. Gaiman has since written many popular novels including ""Stardust,"" ""Neverwhere,"" ""American Gods, ""Coraline"" and most recently, ""The Ocean at the End of the Lane."" But for many fans, ""Sandman"" -- an oftentimes surreal story about the realm of dreams, which originally ran 75 issues -- remains his best known work. Actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a fan, and he's producing a possible ""Sandman"" film. ""Overture"" is Gaiman's first new ""Sandman"" story in 10 years (2003 saw his last ""Sandman"" follow-up, the graphic novel ""Sandman: Endless Nights""). The ""Sandman"" series primarily follows the character Dream, who appears with various names and forms and has control over the dreams of everyone and everything. CNN has an exclusive look at several pages of artwork from ""Overture,"" and Gaiman spoke to us about the return of some of his most popular characters, and why they're back now. (DC Comics is owned by CNN's parent company, Time Warner.) CNN: What made you resurrect ""Sandman?"" Gaiman: It was a combination of things. The joy of stopping ""Sandman"" at the time was I didn't tell all the ""Sandman'""stories I could ever tell. But I did finish the story I started in ""'Sandman"" No. 1. The joy was if I wanted to I could go back and do more. That was where (1999's) ""Sandman: Dream Hunters"" came from. That was where (2003's)  ""Sandman: Endless Nights"" came from and now ""Sandman: Overture."" It was the idea of going back and telling all these stories and all these things that I know and other people don't know. So why don't I tell them? While that's all true, the other thing that drove it was I originally wanted to tell this story back in 2008. It would have been ""Sandman's"" 20th anniversary. For various reasons, DC (Comics) couldn't make it happen. So when (DC Comics president) Diane Nelson came in, she asked is there anything you want to do? And I said I'd really love to do the story for ""Sandman's"" 25th anniversary. It seems huge and a great thing to mark. And she said, 'What a great idea!"" And we set out to do it. CNN: The art of ""Sandman"" has always been extraordinary and otherworldly. What did you have in mind for this one? Gaiman: We had an extremely short list. We had J.H. Williams III, and we're incredibly fortunate that he said yes. It's probably the most beautiful art that I have ever seen in a periodical comic. Whenever he does a page, he takes a photo. I look at the detail and the design. What he's doing is unbelievable. It's unlike anything I've ever seen in a monthly comic. The scene at the end of the first issue of ""Sandman: Overture"" where we see all the different Sandmans from across the universe, all the different versions of Morpheus meeting at once. That's been in my head for 24 years. CNN: And when can we expect more? Gaiman: July will be issue 3 and then probably some more months then issue 4, issue 5 and issue 6. I'm already missing it. The magic of 'Sandman' is going back and finding the characters' voices are still alive and still real. CNN: What will the fans take away from ""Overture?"" Gaiman: The lovely thing about this is I genuinely don't know what the fans will respond to. There's nothing you have to know to read the comic. There's already things which I've written so far in ""Sandman: Overture,"" which when you go back and read the original comic, things will change. CNN: What makes you decide to write a comic book as opposed to a novel, when you have these different kinds of storytelling available to you? Gaiman: Mostly it's ""Do I want to see this drawn?"" One of the most interesting things about ""Sandman: Overture"" is I really, really wanted to see the pictures. The stuff in issue 3 is the nearest ""Sandman"" has ever come to a spaghetti Western. It's not like anything I've ever done in any other way. When I'm outlining a comic, I write down the numbers 1 to 24, and I jot down what's happening on each page, because I have to think of things in terms of pages, and double page spreads. In a novel, if I want to move a scene, I just cut and paste. In a novel, it's a completely different conversation. CNN: Is there still more ""Sandman"" on the horizon? Gaiman: Can I tell ""Sandman"" stories until I die? The characters are still in my head; they're still there. But there's so many more things I need to write before the long night comes, before I put the pen down for the last time. I really hope there's more ""Sandman"" in there. It would be sad if there wasn't. But there's so much more left to write. CNN: Are there more stories you'd like to revisit? Gaiman: The next thing coming out is a little revisit of ""Neverwhere,"" which came out many years ago. It's a ""Neverwhere"" short story called ""How the Marquis Got His Coat Back,"" coming as part of (the anthology) ""Rogues"" in September, edited by George R.R. Martin. CNN: And is there a ""Sandman"" movie in the works, as well as a TV series of ""American Gods?"" Gaiman: I think I'm allowed to tell you that Joseph Gordon-Levitt signed on as a producer for the ""Sandman"" film, and I had a fantastic day spent with Joe talking ""Sandman,"" and his knowledge and commitment to it impressed the hell out of me. And ""American Gods,"" wait and see. People are being talked to, exciting things are going on. CNN: What advice do you have for writers who have read your work and want to try their hand at it? What pitfalls should be avoided? Gaiman: The biggest pitfall to avoid is not writing. Not writing is really, really easy to do, especially if you're a young writer. The hope that elves will come in the night and finish it for you, is a very common one to have. That is my main recommendation. You have to write, and you have to finish what you write and beyond that, it's all detail.","""Sandman: Overture"" is author Neil Gaiman's first Sandman comic book story in 10 years .
""The Sandman,"" first published in 1988, made Gaiman a big name in the world of comic books .

"(CNN) -- In the past two weeks, police have killed at least four people with psychiatric disabilities, each of whom had a weapon. Most recently, police in St. Louis shot Kajieme Powell, killing him just a few miles from Ferguson, Missouri. Powell is black and his death initially ratcheted up tensions, but people have since seemed to accept police explanations. Powell acted erratically, had a knife and refused to put it down. Mental illness made it, in the eyes of many, a sad but unpreventable situation. In cases like these, we need to stop talking about mental illness and start thinking through the implications of psychiatric disabilities. We also need police whose first instinct is to de-escalate tense situations whenever and however possible, and, when necessary, solve confrontations with the absolute minimum amount of force. ""Psychiatric disability"" refers to mental illness that ""significantly interferes with the performance of major life activities,"" a category that clearly applies to people whose ""erratic behavior"" got them killed by police. The distinction matters. In America, being disabled comes with certain civil rights protections. While we generally try to eradicate illness, we are required to accommodate disability. So how does a police officer accommodate someone behaving erratically and holding a knife? Here are the details of the four cases. They came from different races, classes, ages and parts of the country. In each case, police demanded that a disabled person choose between not being disabled or getting shot. Now four more people are dead. After St. Louis police killed Kajieme Powell, they tried to be transparent. They called a news conference, released the incident report, 911 calls and a graphic cell phone video. According to the police, two officers arrived to deal with an individual acting ""erratically."" The officers had been trained to recognize mental illness. They got out of their car. Powell drew a knife. The officers drew their weapons and ordered Powell to drop it and stop. He advanced. On the video, you can hear them firing about seven times. Powell falls. They fire twice more. While some journalists have pointed out discrepancies between the police account and the video, the chief has defended his officers. Once the man wouldn't stop and was within a few feet, what else could they do but shoot? Police in Arizona used a similar explanation after shooting Michelle Cusseaux. Police had arrived to carry out an emergency court order to take her to a mental health facility, called for by her mother. Police had trouble getting her to open the door. She'd open and close it, repeatedly. As the officers forced their way in, Cusseaux came out with a claw hammer. According to witnesses and a spokesman, the officers told her to drop the hammer several times, then shot her when she did not comply. In the aftermath, Phoenix police have lamented the tragedy and promised to implement new training, likely to be ""Crisis Intervention Team"" (CIT) training, an approach that is being implemented all over the country. It's great, but won't solve everything. In San Jose, a CIT-trained officer shot and killed a 19-year-old woman holding a power drill. Diana Showman, who had bipolar disorder, had called police to claim she had an Uzi and would shoot her family. Police understandably responded in numbers and started negotiating. Showman came outside but wouldn't drop the object she was holding. As reported in the San Jose Mercury News, ""They told her many times to stop, to drop her weapon,"" one witness said. ""And she didn't."" One of the five officers fired, just once. Powell had a steak knife, Cusseaux a hammer, and Showman a drill. Jeffrey Towe, in Sacramento, actually had a military combat knife. The actual danger of the weapon, though, doesn't change the shape of the story. Police arrived at the scene because a neighbor heard Towe ranting loudly about, ""four horsemen, cutting hearts out and stuff."" Towe threatened the officers verbally and the police told him to drop the knife, but instead he charged. An officer shot and killed him. Except for the fact that Powell was shot repeatedly, a detail that intensifies the racially charged aspect of that killing, the stories follow a similar pattern. The victim had a weapon and did not respond to police commands to drop it, and so they died. Of course, a person struggling with his or her disability is not likely to follow verbal police commands in a moment of stress. Once the equation reached drop or die, death was inevitable. The only solution is for the police to avoid getting into that situation if at all possible. Unfortunately, this runs directly against police training. Police are trained to display command presence in the face of uncertainly, seizing control of a situation by issuing orders, demanding compliance and using force on those who won't obey. Protect and serve has become command and control. There are other models. Seattle police now teach their recruits to be ""guardians."" Others emphasize patience. When Cusseaux frustrated the police by opening and closing the door repeatedly, why not just wait her out? Moreover, where were the Tasers? Taser-overuse is a major problem, but if they have a place in modern policing, surely it's when confronted by an armed psychiatrically disabled person at close range. There will always be terrible situations in which police must shoot to kill someone struggling with their disability. There could be a lot fewer. Moreover, accommodations for disability tend to have positive ripple effects for the whole population. Every time an able-bodied person uses an automatic door or wheelchair ramp while pulling a suitcase or stroller, they should thank the Americans with Disabilities Act and the power of accommodations. Similarly, if police will accommodate psychiatric disability by not forcing confrontation whenever possible, we will all be a lot safer.","In the past two weeks, police have killed at least four people with psychiatric disabilities .
David Perry: How does a police officer accommodate someone with mental illness?
He says one solution is to train police to act like guardians, another is to use Tasers .
Perry: Being disabled comes with civil rights protections, we can include the mentally ill ."
"Baghdad (CNN) -- Demonstrators clashed with security forces around Iraq on Friday in confrontations that killed at least five people and wounded many others. Protesters attacked and burned government offices in several cities. The clashes were particularly intense in Mosul and Hawijah, in northern Iraq. In Mosul, two people were killed and 20 people were wounded Friday morning when Iraqi security forces opened fire on demonstrators who tried to force their way into a provincial council building in central Mosul, police said. Demonstrators destroyed equipment and burned furniture inside, police said. In the town of Hawijah, west of Kirkuk, three protesters were killed and 12 others were wounded when Iraqi security forces opened fire on protesters after hundreds threw stones at police and troops, Iraqi Army Capt. Mohammed al-Angood said. Demonstrators later set fire to a building housing the city council's offices, police said. Unrest also flared in Baghdad, Falluja, Ramadi and in two towns in the province of Salaheddin. Helicopters hovered and security forces stepped up their presence in Baghdad as more than 2,000 demonstrators gathered in the city's Tahrir Square to protest corruption and poor government services. Iraqi security forces opened fire to disperse crowds after protesters tried to enter the provincial council building in Anbar province. Security forces also opened fire to disperse crowds in two small towns in Salaheddin province, wounding eight protesters, police said. In Basra, in southern Iraq, the governor submitted his resignation just a few hours after hundreds gathered outside his office demanding that he step down. In Falluja, west of the country's capital, hundreds demonstrated outside a city council building. On Thursday, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki urged citizens not to participate in Friday's planned massive protests, claiming former members of Saddam Hussein's regime and terrorists were plotting to take advantage of the demonstrations to create chaos in the country. Iraq's top Shiite religious leaders, including clerics Ali al-Sistani and Muqtada al-Sadr,  also urged that the Friday demonstrations be delayed. Authorities also announced a ban on all vehicle traffic -- except for Iraqi security forces vehicles -- in the cities of Baghdad, Mosul and Samarra and Tikrit, beginning at 12 a.m. Friday. Iraqi security forces have been on full alert since Monday and more Iraqi troops have been deployed to the streets of Baghdad ahead of the demonstrations on Friday, officials with Iraqi security forces tell CNN on condition of anonymity because of security concerns. Since early February, thousands of protesters have participated in a series of demonstrations across the country, apparently inspired by popular uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia. Their protests are against corruption, restrictions on freedom of expression, unemployment and poor government services. A police officer was killed and three others wounded when hundreds of demonstrators protested in the Iraqi town of Halabja over lack of basic services, corruption and unemployment, the town's mayor said Thursday. On Tuesday, hundreds protesting for the same reasons started throwing stones at Iraqi police, Mayor Goran Adham said, wounding 43 police officers in the town, which is located about 84 kilometers (52 miles) southeast of Sulaimaniya in Iraq's Kurdish region. The Iraqi government was formed in December, nine months after an inconclusive national election. This is the second elected government in the nearly eight years after a U.S.-led invasion toppled Hussein.","Police say two people were killed in central Mosul .

"It's time for the United States and its European allies to raise or fold. Russian President Vladimir Putin clearly called their bluff on Tuesday, announcing steps for his country to annex the Crimean Peninsula from neighboring Ukraine. President Barack Obama and European allies had warned such a move would bring tougher sanctions and diplomatic isolation, but there was little immediate response Tuesday to Putin's bold pronouncement in the Russian parliament. The White House announced that Obama invited leaders of the G7 industrial powers to meet next week on the sidelines of a nuclear security summit in the Netherlands to discuss the Ukraine crisis. Presumably, such a gathering by Obama and his counterparts from Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada would consider scrapping their annual summit with Russia planned for July in Sochi, and perhaps kicking Putin out of the G8 club altogether. Both moves have been threatened, with the G7 nations already halting preparations for the Sochi meeting. G8 summit in doubt? White House spokesman Jay Carney strongly hinted Tuesday that it would get scrapped, telling reporters that ""preparations for that summit have been suspended, summits don't occur without preparations"" and ""those preparations look unlikely to resume any time soon."" On Monday, Obama and the European Union imposed sanctions on specific Russian and Crimean officials as part of steps intended to be easily expanded if necessary. Carney said the moves already hurt the Russian economy and the ruble currency, and he indicated further actions were coming. ""You have seen some designations already and there are more to come,"" he said of individuals cited for sanctions. ""I wouldn't, if I were you, invest in Russian equities right now unless you were going short,"" Carney advised, in reference to investors speculating on a losing venture. However, Carney made clear that the U.S. approach focused for now on isolating Russia diplomatically and economically. ""This action -- the results of the referendum and the attempts to annex a region of Ukraine illegally --  will never be recognized by the United States"" and the international community, he said, with ""further actions, further provocations"" by Russia leading to ""higher costs."" Secretary of State John Kerry had a more reflective take, telling a town hall-style meeting that the administration still hoped for a diplomatic solution ""but today was very confrontational and very triumphalist about something that is a breach of international law, and I think people are deeply concerned about it."" Biden: Crimea was a ""land grab"" Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden began a tour of former Soviet bloc nations now NATO allies by pledging the full support of the strategic alliance against any Russian aggression similar to what has occurred in Ukraine. ""Our intent is that NATO emerge from this crisis stronger and more unified than ever,"" Biden said at his first stop in Warsaw. ""Our commitment is absolutely unwavering and unshakeable."" He noted the United States deployed more jet fighters in the region to bolster NATO air policing, and he called Putin's moves to add Crimea to the Russian Federation a ""blatant, blatant violation of international law"" and ""nothing more than a land grab."" Speaking to reporters at a joint news conference with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Biden said Russia responded to Ukraine's efforts to realize a more democratic future ""with a brazen, brazen military incursion, with a purposeful ratcheting up of ethnic tensions inside Ukraine, with a rushed and illegal referendum in Crimea that was, not surprisingly, rejected by virtually the entire world."" Biden also warned Moscow that its political and economic isolation will increase if it continues such aggression, and he reiterated support for Ukraine in the form of a billion-dollar loan guarantee as well as technical assistance to prepare for elections and support for reforms that will allow the International Monetary Fund to provide a stabilization package to the cash-strapped country. The vice president's visit comes two days before European Union leaders will meet in Brussels for talks certain to include the Ukraine crisis. Putin unfazed so far . For his part, Putin appeared unfazed by the initial U.S. and EU steps, telling the parliament on Tuesday that Russia already races lingering sanctions from the Cold War that still exist in practice. He called the events that led to last month's ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych a ""state coup"" carried out through ""terror and murders and pogroms"" by ""Russiaphobes and anti-Semites."" The United States rejects Putin's characterization of the Ukraine political upheaval, instead calling it a demonstration of democratic aspirations by the Ukrainian people. Underlying the conflict was Yanukovych's moves prior to his ouster to align more closely with Moscow instead of proceeding with a shift toward closer association with the EU.

At home, Obama has come under criticism from Republicans who complain an unwillingness by the administration to take on Putin on other issues has now emboldened the Russian leader. Conservative Sen.

""I support the President's decision to issue sanctions against Russian leaders, but that list must be dramatically expanded to exert real pressure,"" Cantor said Tuesday, also urging that Russia be kicked out of G8 and for the United States to provide military support needed by Ukraine.","Secretary Kerry calls latest Russian moves concerning .

"Passengers aboard US Airways Flight 2846 were waiting on the tarmac at Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport when their pilot came on the intercom. ""We've been notified about a health emergency aboard the aircraft,"" passenger Dean Davidson heard. A few minutes later, Davidson saw a flight attendant walk toward another passenger sitting a few rows ahead of him. The flight attendant handed the slender middle-aged man a medical mask. Emergency personnel boarded the plane a short time later and removed the man, Davidson said. A firefighter then came on the intercom and announced that the passenger had active tuberculosis and was contagious and that other passengers on the flight had been exposed. He advised them to contact their physicians immediately, Davidson said. Arizona health officials are not recommending passengers on the plane seek medical care because their risk of being infected with tuberculosis is ""very, very low,"" said Dr. Rebecca Sunshine, disease control director for Maricopa County Public Health. ""To put this in perspective... We're much more concerned that the passengers on this flight contracted influenza than that they contracted TB,"" she said. The US Airways flight took off from Austin, Texas, on Friday, according to airline spokesman Bill McGlashen. It landed in Phoenix approximately two hours later on a layover before it was scheduled to fly to Los Angeles. There was no warning or flag on the passenger's record when he was going through security or when he boarded the plane, McGlashen said. After the plane took off, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified the Transportation Security Administration of a possible risk. The TSA then notified US Airways, McGlashen said. The passenger in question has not been confirmed to have an infectious disease, CDC spokeswoman Karen Hunter said Sunday. ""And even if a passenger had infectious TB, the duration of the flight was so short that there would likely be no risk of exposure to other passengers."" Another spokesperson for the CDC said Monday the government organization is still waiting on test results for the passenger, a U.S. citizen who was traveling internationally. Fast facts about tuberculosis . Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which mainly affects the lungs. It can also infect other parts of the body including the kidneys, spine and brain. There are two types of TB: latent TB infection, which is not contagious, and TB disease, which is contagious. A person infected with latent TB shows no sign of symptoms and may not feel sick. Someone with TB disease usually feels ill; they may be coughing up blood and may have a fever, night sweats and/or chest pain. TB spreads through the air when a person with an active TB infection coughs, sneezes or speaks. Germs can stay in the air for hours, but the risk in this case was very small, said Dr. William Schaffner, an expert on infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. ""The risk is greatest for people sitting two rows ahead of and two rows behind the individuals,"" Schaffner said. ""We don't have to worry about the blankets and seat rests and the like. It's how the air is transmitted and handled in the plane."" Schaffner said passengers on the plane should have a TB skin test done by their local health care provider. People who contract TB must take several medications for six to nine months to combat the infection, according to the CDC. Some varieties of the TB bacterium have developed a resistance to common antibiotics and may be more difficult to treat. People with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, are particularly susceptible to the disease. The number of TB cases in the United States has been declining since 1992, according to the CDC. In 2010, the most recent CDC data available, there were 569 deaths from TB. Davidson was flying home from Austin, where he had been visiting his daughter for Thanksgiving. He said other passengers told him the potentially infected man appeared ""awkward"" before and during the flight, continually rubbing his face. Davidson plans to get in touch with his doctor Monday morning. He said he has not heard from US Airways about the incident. In January 2010, a person infected with an active case of tuberculosis flew from Philadelphia to San Francisco on US Airways despite being on the CDC's ""Do Not Board"" list, which is different from the TSA's ""No Fly"" list. The Do Not Board list was created in 2007 after Atlanta lawyer Andrew Speaker traveled abroad with a drug-resistant case of tuberculosis, setting off an international health scare. Speaker insisted that he had not been told he was contagious; public health officials disagreed. The CDC manages the Do Not Board list in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security. The list is authorized under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, according to the CDC. Local and state health officials can contact the CDC to request that someone be placed on the list. ""To include someone on the list, CDC must determine that the person 1) likely is contagious with a communicable disease that would constitute a serious public health threat should the person be permitted to board a flight; 2) is unaware of or likely to be nonadherent with public health recommendations, including treatment; and 3) likely will attempt to board a commercial aircraft,"" the CDC website states. ""Once a person is placed on the list, airlines are instructed not to issue a boarding pass to the person for any commercial domestic flight or for any commercial international flight arriving in or departing from the United States."" The Do Not Board list does not apply to other methods of transportation. The CDC reviews the records of every person on the list every two weeks to see whether they are eligible to fly again. In general, airline passengers are not legally obligated to tell an airline when they are sick, said Jeff Ment, an attorney who specializes in travel law. Unlike cruise lines, which require you to disclose illnesses leading up to the cruise, he said, airlines do not include any language in the ticket purchasing process that would prevent you from traveling. ""If you have some disease and its contagious, where's the threshold?"" he asked. ""If you have the flu? If you have a really bad cold? I think that once you establish some rule that there has to be notification, it becomes a slippery slope."" As a ""common carrier,"" Ment said, airlines are legally required to do as much as possible to ensure the safety of their passengers. If a passenger appears too ill to survive the flight without medical assistance, an airline could prevent him from flying, he said. Or if the airline knew that a passenger had a contagious disease, employees could require her to wear a mask during the flight to prevent germs from spreading. In this kind of situation, any legal troubles would more likely stem from a civil lawsuit. After the 2007 incident, Speaker was sued by eight of his fellow passengers in a Canadian court. Ment said plaintiffs would have to show that the infected passenger knew that he had the disease and was extremely careless around his fellow travelers. ""The line is crossed when the person knows they're sick and intentionally tries to do something (to infect others) or acts with callous disregard for your well-being,"" Ment said.","Health officials are not recommending other passengers seek medical care .

"Three New York courts have rejected one group's legal effort to grant captive chimpanzees in that state the same rights as a ""legal person."" The Nonhuman Rights Project filed three separate suits on behalf of four chimpanzees in New York state last week in a bid to secure for Tommy, Kiko, Hercules and Leo -- all male chimps held in various parts of the state -- the ""right to bodily liberty."" The lawsuits asked that the four chimpanzees be moved to a sanctuary ""where they can live out their days with others of their kind in an environment as close to the wild as is possible in North America,"" the group said. The group says it will appeal the courts' decisions. ""These outcomes allow the NhRP to proceed to the appellate courts,""  NhRP spokeswoman Stacey Doss told CNN. Are we really different from animals? NhRP founder and President Steven Wise said before the suits were filed that he would ""be asking judges to recognize, for the first time, that these cognitively complex, autonomous beings have the basic legal right to not be imprisoned."" Tommy's owner, Pat Levery, dismissed the notion that he confines the 26-year-old chimp to a prison. Tommy lives in a cage on a trailer lot in Gloversville, New York. ""Totally ridiculous"" he said of the lawsuit, which he has not read. ""I'd be happy to show you Tommy's home, to show you how well he is cared for,"" Levery said. When reached by CNN Monday, he did not know the suit had been rejected. He said that he was relieved and that he had assumed the lawsuit would not proceed.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- As more people are getting sick from the H1N1 flu virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting that the production of the H1N1 vaccine is slower than expected. CDC believes that up to 12 million fewer doses of H1N1 vaccine than expected will be available by month's end. The CDC had hoped that about 40 million doses of H1N1, or swine flu, vaccine would be available by the end of October. But due to manufacturing delays, ""we think at most it will be 10 to 12 million doses less,"" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, CDC's director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. She told reporters Friday that manufacturers are making unprecedented amounts of vaccine, but difficulties growing the vaccine, as well as time-consuming potency and purity testing, are contributing to the delay. ""We are not cutting any corners in the safety of the production of the vaccine or the testing and oversight of the vaccine"" Schuchat explained. As of Wednesday, 11.4 million doses of flu vaccine were available to be ordered and 8 million doses had been ordered by state health departments, the CDC said. Doctors, hospitals and clinics have to order the H1N1 vaccine through their state's health department. Each state decides how to dole out the vaccine when it becomes available. Schuchat acknowledged that it can be frustrating for people searching for this vaccine now. Availability will be limited for the next week or two, she said. Georgia, for example, is going to get less than half of the amount of H1N1 vaccine that it was expecting to receive this month, state Public Health Commissioner Dr. Rhonda Medows said. In August the federal government told Georgia it would receive 2 million doses by the end of October, but this week officials learned they would receive only 912,000 doses by end of the month. A little more than half of the available doses are flu shots, she said, and the other doses are the nasal flu spray, which is approved only for healthy people between the ages of 2 and 49. Pregnant women cannot take the nasal vaccine. The nasal form first became available on October 5 and the first H1N1 flu shots started shipping this week. The CDC is not expecting widespread availability of the H1N1 vaccine until the end of this month or beginning of November, and ""we know it's not enough, given the demand,"" Schuchat said. The CDC also is reporting unprecedented flu activity for this time of the year, as flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths continue to increase. The amount of flu and pneumonia illness is above epidemic levels, Schuchat said.  Watch Dr. Anne Schuchat discuss availability of H1N1 vaccine » . She also said the number of children who had died from the H1N1 virus has risen to 86, with 43 since August 30. In a regular flu season, which lasts from September to May, 40 to 50 children usually succumb to flu. Nearly half of the children who died in the past month were between the ages of 12 and 17, the CDC said. Children and young adults ranging in age from 6 months to 24 years are among those health officials say should be the first to get the H1N1 vaccine. Health care workers, pregnant women and people with underlying illness also should be among the first to get vaccine, they say.","CDC had hoped 40 million doses would be available by end of October .

"Did the National Football League make $10.5 billion in 2013, pay its chief executive Roger Goodell $44.2 million, yet pay no taxes to Uncle Sam? Well, yes and no. The National Football League pays taxes through its various money-making offshoots such as NFL Properties and NFL Ventures, but the league office in midtown Manhattan, which paid Goodell his very handsome salary, doesn't. The reason goes back to 1942 when the IRS ruled the NFL was a trade association for its now 32-member teams and therefore exempt from taxes as a nonprofit under section 501(c)6 of the tax code. Just to be safe, the NFL lobbied Washington in 1966 on the eve of its merger with the American Football League. Two powerful Louisiana politicians, Sen. Russell Long and Rep. Hale Boggs, wanted a football team in New Orleans. Then-NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle wanted antitrust protection and confirmed tax-exempted status for the league office. The Saints were born in New Orleans and in exchange, Rozelle got his wish slipped into an unrelated federal bill on investments and depreciation. Sports attorney and expert on the NFL's tax exemption, Andy Delaney, told CNN, ""Pete Rozelle was a forward-looking guy, I can't imagine what those two lines (of text), maybe three is worth today."" Millions, it turns out, according to Sen. Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican who wants the tax-exemption for professional sports teams gone. For all the professional sports leagues -- including the PGA Tour and NHL among others -- that use the loophole, ""It amounts to like $10 million a year. $10 or 11 million a year. Probably $110 million over the next 10 years. But the point is why should they have that?"" Coburn told CNN. Coburn has introduced the PRO Sports Act to strip the NFL and others of the decades-old exemption. What the NFL pays -- and doesn't -- in taxes . According to NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy, ""every dollar of income that is earned in the National Football League -- from game tickets, television rights fees, jersey sales and national sponsorships -- is subject to tax.  None of this income is shielded in a tax-exempt entity.  Instead, the NFL's 32 clubs pay tax on all of these revenues."" But that's not 100% true, Coburn said. ""The individual owners and teams pay taxes. We're not going after them, but what they do is they can put all this confluence of money into the league office and do this as a nonprofit, which means they're not paying taxes like every other business that would be in a trade business like they are,"" Coburn said. The nonprofit NFL raked in more than $326 million from April 2012 to March 2013, almost of all of which came from ""membership dues and assessments"" or league fees paid by the member teams, according to a CNN analysis of IRS documents. Those dues are tax deductible for the teams as ""business expenses"" according to the IRS. Delaney thinks the NFL calling itself a nonprofit is too much. ""I don't think anything they are doing is illegal, but it is not in the spirit of a nonprofit, nonprofits don't have directors with salaries north of 40 million,"" he said. ""It's a business, and they should call it that."" Goodell's salary, which comes from the NFL's nonprofit arm, rivals some of the top-paid CEOs in the corporate world. Goodell's compensation would rank in the top 20 for CEOs of U.S. public companies and above the leaders of Disney, Visa and Yahoo, according to a chart of total compensation compiled by the AFL-CIO. NFL's team in Washington . Redskins owner Dan Snyder may lead D.C.'s on-the-field franchise, but former Obama adviser Cynthia Hogan just recently became the new team captain of the NFL's real powerhouse squad: its lobbyists. According to a CNN analysis, the NFL employed 20 lobbyists in 2014 and spent more than $1 million in efforts to sway lawmakers. In a swanky building just blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, the NFL employs six lobbyists, including four on its own payroll. The other two come from powerhouse law and lobbying firm Covington and Burling, which also employs former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. Tagliabue is not a registered lobbyist as of this writing, instead he ""uses his experience as chief executive and board member of the National Football League, major businesses and nonprofits to advise clients on matters of organizational structure and governance, develop strategic risk mitigation approaches and assist in managing unfolding crises."" Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, which runs the transparency website Opensecrets.org, says the NFL's lobbying team is ""all pro,"" and almost all are ""former government employees, former Hill staffers. So they have good access by buying the help of people who know how to navigate Congress."" Nineteen of the 20 worked for Congress,  largely in the offices of House and Senate leaders, according to a CNN review of lobbying disclosures. The NFL even paid another influential lobby shop, Elmendorf | Ryan, to lobby against Coburn's bill, which thus far has been benched -- referred to the Senate Finance Committee with no action expected anytime soon. But that may be changing. Both Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, and Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat, have introduced bills similar to Coburn's legislation. Booker wants the tax money to go to preventing domestic violence. Cantwell wants the NFL to scrap the Redskins moniker. If the NFL were to lose its tax exemption, there's  precedence for it. Major League Baseball gave up its nonprofit status in 2007, and the National Basketball Association never had one.","The NFL has for-profit business, but the league office is technically a trade association .
Therefore, it pays no taxes and owners can deduct the dues they pay .
Commissioner Roger Goodell makes as much as some of the highest paid CEOs .
Some in Washington are trying to change the law while others lobby against it ."
"While Saint Patrick's Day has long been the preserve of Guinness-drinking revellers painting the world's towns green while wearing shamrock hats, Irish Catholics have always taken pride in their nation's patron saint. Now a new study from Cambridge University based on his writings suggests Saint Patrick was not brought to Ireland as a slave, as the legend has it, but that in fact he may actually have sold slaves his family owned to pay his way to Ireland -- in order to avoid a job as a tax collector for the Roman empire. The findings fly in the face of the classic account of the life of Saint Patrick, who grew up as a member of the Roman nobility in western Britain and was supposedly abducted and forced into slavery in Ireland around 400 A.D. According to this history, Patrick escaped and became a priest before having a vision and returning to Ireland to convert the Irish to Christianity. Legend has it Saint Patrick used the shamrock, now the national emblem of Ireland, to explain the concept of the Holy Trinity, by showing an unbeliever the three-leafed plant with one stalk. The new study, based on Patrick's own writings in their historical context, argues that Patrick actually ended up in Ireland in order to avoid becoming a ""Decurion,"" or Roman tax collector -- a role in city government that had become undesirable and dangerous in Patrick's time. ""In the troubled era in which Patrick lived, which saw the demise and eventual collapse of Roman government in Britain in 410, discharging the obligations of a Decurion, especially tax-collecting, would not only have been difficult but also very risky,"" said Dr. Roy Flechner, from the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic at Cambridge University. Patrick's father was a Decurion, which was a hereditary role, and when he vacated his position in order to join the clergy, Flechner says Patrick chose to leave Britain to avoid being obligated to take up his father's job. In order to get to Ireland, which lacked a monetary system at the time, Patrick would have needed to sell commodities to finance the trip. According to his writings, Patrick's family owned several slaves -- a high value and easily transportable commodity -- and Flechner says in the historical context it makes sense that Patrick would convert his family wealth into slaves he could sell in order to pay his way. But Philip Freeman, author of the biography ""St. Patrick of Ireland,"" says while it is almost certain that Patrick's family owned slaves, as many members of the Roman nobility did at the time, experts' claims that Patrick himself was a slave trader is reading too far into the sources. ""It's almost certain that Patrick grew up surrounded by slaves, but there's no good reason for thinking he was a slave trader,"" Freeman told CNN. ""The only sources we have about Patrick that are really reliable are the two letters he wrote when he was an old man,"" he said. ""And both of those tell the story of a young man who grew up in the young Roman nobility in Britain, but was kidnapped when he was 16 years old."" Cambridge University's Roy Flechner believes the widely accepted history of Saint Patrick's early life and kidnapping was largely concocted by Patrick himself in those letters. ""The traditional story that Patrick was kidnapped from Britain, forced to work as a slave, but managed to escape and reclaim his status, is likely to be fiction: the only way out of slavery in this period was to be redeemed, and Patrick was never redeemed. The traditional legend was instigated by Patrick himself in the letters he wrote, because this is how he wanted to be remembered,"" he said. Flechner says it is only Patrick's motives, and not his efforts to Christianize the Irish people, that are up for debate. ""None of this is to say that Patrick was not a bishop or that he did not engage in missionary activity, but his primary motives for moving to Ireland were most likely to escape the poisoned chalice of his inherited position in Roman Britain,"" he added. While very little is known about Saint Patrick, one legend has credited him with having driven the snakes out of Ireland. However, most biologists maintain there never were snakes in Ireland.","St. Patrick's Day is the feast day St. Patrick, patron saint of Ireland .

"Simferopol, Ukraine (CNN) -- Hostilities intensified in Crimea on Saturday as Ukrainian officials accused pro-Russian forces of armed aggression and President Barack Obama rounded up world leaders to demand Russia ""de-escalate the situation."" Obama called British, French and Italian leaders and hosted a conference call with the presidents of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, the White House said. ""All of the leaders agreed on the need for Russia to pull its military forces back to their bases, allow for the deployment of international observers and human rights monitors to the Crimean peninsula, and agree quickly on the formation of a contact group that could lead to direct dialogue between Ukraine and Russia to de-escalate the situation and restore Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" a White House statement said. They also rejected a proposed referendum in Crimea on whether it should rejoin Russia ""as a violation of Ukraine's constitution,"" the White House said. ""The leaders made clear that Russia's continued violation of international law will isolate it from the international community,"" the White House said. Secretary of State John Kerry phoned Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Saturday and issued a diplomatic ultimatum, according to a senior U.S. administration official. ""He made clear that continued military escalation and provocation in Crimea or elsewhere in Ukraine, along with steps to annex Crimea to Russia would close any available space for diplomacy, and he urged utmost restraint,"" the official said. Kerry said the United States is ready to work with allies to facilitate a Ukraine-Russia dialogue, the official said. French President Francois Hollande said he and Obama ""discussed the need for Russia and Ukraine to find a peaceful exit from the crisis and to fully restore the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" Hollande's office said. Tense in Crimea . Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials charged that pro-Russian forces comprised of 100 armed men reportedly took control of a military office in the Crimean regional capital, Simferopol. The men, equipped with automatic weapons, say they belong to the Crimean self-defense forces, Vladislav Seleznyov, the head of the Ministry of Defense media office, said on his Facebook page. A CNN team that visited the scene said it appeared calm. Armed, masked men were at the entrance, and Russian flags were being painted on the gates. Those questioned declined to say what was happening inside. Amid signs that the tense standoff of the past week is growing more volatile, Russian troops also stormed a Crimean border control point at Schelkino, near Kerch, early Saturday, seizing the armory and driving the officers' families from their living quarters, Ukraine's border service said. Meanwhile, a light plane belonging to Ukraine's State Border Protection Service was fired upon Saturday afternoon while flying over the Crimean border from Armyansk, the service said. ""The aircraft crew recorded shooting aimed at the plane. The extremists opened fire with automatic weapons. The pilots made a sudden maneuver, descended to the minimal height and, with accelerated speed, changed the course,"" the border guard service said. The plane landed at its base, with no damage and no injuries to the crew, the service said. It blamed ""Russian armed aggressors"" for targeting the plane, which has no weapons. Armed men have now refused for three consecutive days to allow military observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, or OSCE, to enter the Crimea region. The observers are returning to the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson to plan their next steps after being denied entry at the Armyansk crossing point Saturday, the OSCE said. The OSCE said shots were fired in the air when a group of people wearing balaclavas approached the checkpoint ahead of its party. A convoy of military vehicles, believed to be carrying Russian soldiers, traveled through Simferopol on Saturday, heading toward the border post at Armyansk, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense told CNN. Armyansk is one of the key main access points between southern Ukraine and Crimea, and the Ministry of Defense is trying to find out if the convoy will stop there, said Vladislav Seleznev, the Crimean press secretary for the Ministry of Defense. Poland evacuates consulate . The crisis in Crimea began about a week ago, when pro-Russian troops quietly took effective control of the region. Since then, tensions have flared between Moscow and Kiev over the Black Sea peninsula, while the world's diplomats have urged that conflict be avoided. Earlier Saturday, Moscow accused the OSCE, a regional advisory group, of hypocrisy. First, condemn violence by demonstrators in Kiev that led to the ouster of Ukraine's former President Viktor Yanukovych, the foreign ministry said, according to state-run news agency RIA Novosti. Then talk about Crimea. ""Some OSCE members and executive bodies have acted in the worst traditions of double standards while dealing with the situation in Ukraine,"" the ministry reportedly said. Amid mounting tensions, Poland has decided to pull staff from its consulate in Sevastopol, the Crimean port city where Russia has a large naval base. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski tweeted, ""Because of continuing disturbances by Russian forces there, we have reluctantly evacuated our consulate."" Russian demands . Earlier Saturday, Lavrov insisted Russia was not militarily involved in the standoff in Crimea. ""We are ready to continue dialogue, with the understanding that the dialogue will be honest and a partnership, and without attempts to cast us as a party to the conflict -- which is what a few of our partners are trying to do now. This crisis was not created by us,"" he said. That dialogue might not include Ukraine's new interim government, whom Lavrov criticized. ""The current government is dependent on the radical nationalists who seized the power,"" he said. ""Even our Western partners know what they are like. They visit Ukraine often. But they try to hide the facts."" The aim of dialogue would be the implementation of a deal agreed upon on February 21, Lavrov said, when Yanukovych was still in power. This envisaged fresh elections, constitutional reform and the disbanding of illegal armed groups. Ukrainian authorities and Western powers have said there are Russian troops on the ground in Crimea, despite the Kremlin's denials. The interim government was voted in by a large majority in Ukraine's parliament, including members of Yanukovych's own Party of Regions, after he fled the country for Russia following bloody street protests. Protesters were angry over his rebuff of a trade deal with the European Union in favor of one with Russia. Ukraine: Let observers into Crimea . Ukrainian Acting Foreign Minister Andrii Deshchytsia urged Moscow on Saturday to pursue diplomacy, not violence. ""We cannot afford to let anybody die in this conflict,"" he said. Ukraine will continue down a diplomatic path, he said, and will not respond to Russian ""provocations."" He urged Russia not to block international organizations like the OSCE and United Nations from sending observers into Crimea. Live: Ukraine crisis updates . Russia says the armed men who have taken control of key sites in Crimea are local self-defense forces. Map: How Ukraine is divided . Crimea, a self-governing region in southern Ukraine with an ethnic Russian majority and strong cultural ties to Russia, has become the epicenter of a battle for influence between Moscow, Kiev and the West since Yanukovych was pushed out of office. Complete coverage on the Ukraine crisis . Russian fears . Anton Fedyashin, executive director of the Initiative for Russian Culture and a professor of history at American University, told CNN that Russia had nothing to gain from the current tensions in Ukraine. ""There is no advantage for Russia to stoke this instability,"" he said. ""A lot of it is instability that is born of the great cultural, ethnic and now political divisions that are on the ground."" While most Ukrainians do not want to be allied solely with either Russia or Europe, he said, Moscow is definitely concerned by Kiev's turn toward the West. ""The great Russian fear right now is that Ukraine, in the guise of being incorporated economically into Europe, is slowly incorporated into the NATO alliance,"" he said. ""Ultimately, of course, Russians are concerned about their Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol. This explains their very harsh and highly risky reaction, and the presence of what seem to be Russian forces in the Crimea."" Russian speakers make up about 60% of Crimea's population of more than 2 million, but around a quarter are Ukrainian and 12% are Crimean Tatar, a predominantly Muslim minority. Neither of the latter two groups would welcome a switch to Russian control. President Obama has proposed a potential solution to Putin that would include direct talks between Kiev and Moscow and the replacement of Russian forces with international monitors to protect the rights of ethnic Russians. International Women's Day . Women in Ukraine are typically celebratory during International Women's Day, held Saturday, but not this year. The military tensions have cast a pall over the day, said Maia Mikhaluk, a CNN iReporter in Kiev. ""Usually it's a celebration that symbolizes the beginning of spring. But right now it's hard to get into any kind for festive mood,"" Mikhaluk said. ""The most common wish when people congratulate women with Women's Day today is a wish for peace in our country."" In Simferopol, women voiced opposition to the pro-Russian Crimean government and advocated the peninsula remaining as part of Ukraine. Asset freezes, visa bans . The West has also offered financial support to the fledgling government in Kiev. Ukraine's new government and the EU have agreed to revive a trade deal and an aid package that could bring $15 billion to Ukraine. Such aid is desperately needed. Russian energy giant Gazprom has not received any payment from Ukraine in February -- and cannot supply natural gas for free, the company's CEO Alexey Miller said, according to Russian state news agency Itar-Tass. If Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Ukraine, as it did during a dispute in 2009, then European nations could also suffer shortages, since major gas pipelines pass through Ukraine on their way from Russia to Europe.

"Edward Snowden's hopes of finding asylum from U.S. prosecution on espionage charges appeared to dim Tuesday as country after country denied his request or said he would have to find a way to travel to their territory to apply. While Bolivia and Venezuela seemed supportive, 11 of the 21 countries he's applied to, including Ecuador and Iceland, have said they can't consider his request until he shows up at one of their embassies or on their borders. Three -- Brazil, India and Poland -- have denied the request outright. And Bolivia said Tuesday the plane carrying its president, Evo Morales, was denied permission to land for refueling in either France or Portugal because of ""unfounded"" rumors that Snowden was aboard. Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca told Bolivian television that the jet made an emergency landing in the Austrian capital of Vienna and that Bolivia wanted an explanation from Paris and Lisbon. ""We don't know who has come up with this huge lie,"" Choquehuanca said, adding, ""We would like to let the international community know that the rights of aerial traffic for Bolivia have been violated."" Morales had been in Russia, where he told the Russia Today news network that he would be willing to consider asylum for Snowden. And Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, also in Moscow for a tribute to his late predecessor, Hugo Chavez,  said Snowden deserves protection, not prosecution. 'Unbowed' Snowden seeks new havens . Maduro said Snowden's decision to leak details of American surveillance programs were ""a warning signal to the world,"" according to statement from the president's office. ""He's now being persecuted and you have to wonder, why is he being persecuted?"" Maduro asked. ""How many missiles has Snowden launched against innocent peoples around the world?  Has Snowden planted bombs that killed (people) ... What crimes has he committed against humanity?"" But as of Tuesday evening, it did not appear that either country had made a firm offer of asylum, or any way for him to leave Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport. Snowden had already withdrawn his asylum request with Russian authorities after President Vladimir Putin said he would have to ""stop his work aimed at harming our American partners"" if he wanted to stay in the country. That appeared to leave him in much the same pickle he's been in since he left Hong Kong last month for Moscow. Russian authorities say he remains in the airport transit area -- technically a free man, but unable to travel after the United States revoked his passport. Neither WikiLeaks nor Snowden has commented on the rejections. The group released a statement attributed to Snowden late Monday in which he blasted the Obama administration for trying to block his efforts to seek refuge. ""These are the old, bad tools of political aggression,"" Snowden said. ""Their purpose is to frighten, not me, but those who would come after me."" But he added, ""I am unbowed in my convictions and impressed at the efforts taken by so many."" In Monday's statement, Snowden criticized the Obama administration for yanking his passport once criminal charges were filed, ""leaving me a stateless person."" But he said the administration isn't afraid of people like him or others accused of disclosing U.S. secrets. ""No, the Obama administration is afraid of you,"" he said. ""It is afraid of an informed, angry public demanding the constitutional government it was promised -- and it should be."" The United States has been pressing countries to refuse Snowden entry and hand him over to face espionage charges. His disclosures about widespread U.S. surveillance of telephones and Internet users in the United States and abroad -- based largely on documents he has acknowledged taking while an National Security Agency contractor in Hawaii -- have created a political storm at home and diplomatic headaches overseas for President Barack Obama. Opinion: U.S. intelligence community is out of control . On Monday, Obama had to defend U.S. intelligence practices after fresh reports about alleged U.S. surveillance of European Commission offices in the United States and Europe, as well as surveillance at diplomatic facilities in the United States. The German news magazine Der Spiegel reported Sunday that information from Snowden detailed NSA bugging of European Union offices in Washington and New York, as well as an ""electronic eavesdropping operation"" that tapped into an EU building in Brussels, Belgium. The reports generated a furor among European leaders, who demanded the United States come clean about the surveillance. Some, including French President Francois Hollande, said ending any such surveillance would be necessary before European leaders would be willing to start negotiations on a trans-Atlantic free trade agreement championed by Obama. Asked at a news conference in Tanzania about the latest leaks involving Snowden, Obama said he needed more information on the specific programs cited in the Der Spiegel report, but made clear such spying was commonplace. ""I guarantee you that in European capitals, there are people who are interested in, if not what I had for breakfast, at least what my talking points might be should I end up meeting with their leaders,"" Obama said. ""That is how intelligence services operate."" Asylum applications . In addition to Snowden's earlier applications to Ecuador, Russia and Iceland, WikiLeaks on Sunday submitted applications to 18 countries on Snowden's behalf: Austria, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Cuba, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Poland, Spain, Switzerland and Venezuela. The organization said that the documents it had submitted for the latest asylum requests ""outline the risks of persecution Mr. Snowden faces in the United States."" Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa told the British newspaper The Guardian that the American fugitive would have to reach Ecuadorian territory for his request to be considered. ""Are we responsible for getting him to Ecuador? It's not logical,"" he told The Guardian, one of the recipients of Snowden's leaks. ""The country that has to give him a safe conduct document is Russia."" He added that the decision to issue Snowden temporary travel documents that allowed him to leave Hong Kong was ""a mistake on our part,"" The Guardian reported. Over the weekend, Correa said Vice President Joe Biden asked Ecuador to reject Snowden's request. Obama said Monday that Snowden had traveled to Russia without a valid passport or legal papers and that he hoped that Moscow would handle the case as it would any other travel-related matter. Here's a rundown of what countries are saying about Snowden's asylum requests: . • Austria: His request is not valid, because applicants must be in Austria and submit their applications in person. • Bolivia: Despite WikiLeaks' statement, Morales, the Bolivian president, said Bolivia has not received a request for asylum on Snowden's behalf, Itar-Tass reported. • Brazil: The country won't grant asylum or even respond to the request, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing a Foreign Ministry spokesman. • China: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday it had no information to offer on Snowden's case. • Cuba: No response yet. • Ecuador: The South American country has said that it's considering Snowden's request but that he needs to reach its territory. • Finland: ""We don't have an official application from Snowden,"" Jorma Vuorio, director general for the migration department of the Interior Ministry, told CNN. ""He just left a letter requesting asylum at the Finnish Embassy in Moscow. According to Finnish legislation, it is not possible to leave an asylum application outside the Finnish territory."" • France: Hollande, the French president, said he has ""not received any particular demands from Mr. Snowden,"" according to French television reports. • Germany: Asylum requests must be made from within the country, but an Interior Ministry spokesman also said ""the German right of residence principally entails the possibility of acceptance from abroad, if this seems necessary for international legal or urgent humanitarian reasons, or for the ensuring of political interests of the federal republic of Germany. This needs to be examined thoroughly in the case of Mr. Snowden."" • Iceland: Officials have said asylum seekers need to be in Icelandic territory in order to apply. • India: Ministry of External Affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said Tuesday that India will deny the request. • Ireland: The Irish Justice Ministry declined to confirm whether it had received a request on Snowden's behalf, but said Irish law requires that applicants reach the country's borders before a request can be considered. • Italy: The Italian Foreign Ministry said it received an asylum request by fax. The country accepts requests made in Italian territory or at the border, the ministry said. • The Netherlands: Snowden would need to be in Holland to formally request shelter, a spokesman for the Dutch state secretary said Tuesday. • Nicaragua: No response yet. • Norway: The country confirms the receipt of his request, but usually, asylum seekers must be in the country already to be allowed to apply. The Ministry of Justice is considering whether or not to process his application. • Poland: Snowden's request for asylum doesn't fulfill requirements, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday. • Russia: Snowden has withdrawn his request for permission to stay in Russia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday, according to the news agency RIA Novosti. • Spain: The country is not reviewing Snowden's request because it must be made from within or on its borders, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said. • Switzerland: Applicants for political asylum have to be on Swiss soil, a spokeswoman for the Swiss federal office for migration said Tuesday. Swiss authorities aren't aware of any application by Snowden, the spokeswoman said. • Venezuela: ""We haven't been asked for help, but when he asks, he will have an answer,"" Maduro, the Venezuelan president, said Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- Anti-government protesters in Oman refused to end protests Monday, despite orders from the sultan to hire 50,000 people and pay a stipend to people who are out of work, sources in the Gulf state told CNN. Demonstrators in the town of Sohar have blocked routes to the port and the industrial zone, prompting port staff to leave work, two sources in the town said. Protesters demands include greater freedom of expression, higher salaries, a clampdown on government corruption, a new constitution, and the prosecution of security officials whose actions led to the death of demonstrators. It's the third day of demonstrations in Oman's second city, a key port. Oman is not a major oil producer, but a significant share of the world's oil shipping passes through the Strait of Hormuz, along the Omani coast. Oil prices did not appear to be spiking on Monday's Omani unrest. Witnesses did not report any clashes between security and the protesters, saying the two sides were keeping apart. There were reports of attacks on property over the weekend, but on Monday the protesters organized committees to protect buildings and handle traffic, CNN's sources said. Fifteen young protesters submitted their demands in writing to officials Monday, with promises that the demands would passed to the sultan. There have been calls for demonstrations in the capital Muscat on Tuesday. Sultan Qaboos bin Said ordered the hiring of 50,000 citizens in the aftermath of weekend protests that left at least one person dead and 11 others injured, state-run media reported Sunday. The ruler also issued royal orders saying job-seekers who register with the Ministry of Manpower will be paid 150 rials (about U.S. $390) per month until they find jobs, according to the Oman News Agency. After reports of multiple deaths on Sunday, Ahmed Al Saidi, the minister of health, said there had only been one death. The protests started Saturday and were ongoing Monday, said Zamzam al Rashdi, editor-in-chief of the state-run Oman News Agency. A supermarket was burned Monday morning, she said. Sunday's demonstration started peacefully before a couple of groups split off and started attacking a supermarket and a police station, and members from the Shura Council, al Rashdi said. One of the targeted buildings was the Walli House, where the governor who represents the sultan in Sohar lives, a witness told CNN. CNN's Caroline Faraj, Jennifer Fenton and Victoria Brown contributed to this report.","NEW: Demonstrators in Oman's second city close routes to the port and industrial area .

"Damascus, Syria (CNN) -- Syria's military spokesman says more than 400 members of security forces have been killed in the months-long unrest that has taken hold in the country, a charge that came as videos surfaced allegedly showing children killed in the violence. In an interview with CNN in Damascus, Maj. Gen. Riad Haddad said that 1,300 security personnel also were wounded, and that 300 soldiers, 60 security officials and 50 police died in the violence. He also has said 700 people, whom he described as terrorists, and their families had fled Syrian authorities for Turkey. Haddad offered no details about the killings of the security forces other than to blame the deaths on armed gangs. CNN cannot independently verify the claim. President Bashar al-Assad has faced growing criticism from leaders in the United States, Europe and elsewhere over his government's violent clampdown on demonstrators. Al-Assad has repeatedly blamed ""armed gangs"" in explaining its military crackdowns, which have pushed thousands of Syrians to flee to Turkey. Security sources in Lebanon told CNN that about 1,000 Syrians have crossed into Lebanon near the town of Hermel. Months of protests have left more than 1,100 dead, according to human rights activists. But the extent of the carnage is not clear. About 10,000 people have been jailed since mid-March when the protests began, said Rami Abdelrahman, head of the London-based Syria Observatory for Human Rights. CNN cannot independently verify the claims of the activist or the human rights group. Haddad's claim came as two videos surfaced on YouTube purporting to show a 13-year-old boy killed Friday in al-Kiswah, a suburb of Damascus. In the video, a hand is seen turning the head of the boy to reveal what appears to be a surgical scar. The boy's mother is also seen in the video moaning and cursing al-Assad and his security forces. A voice on the video identifies the boy as Ridah Alawiyah. In another video, mourners are seen at a funeral for two children  and a man who were said to have been killed in a Damascus suburb. Mourners can be heard chanting: ""Patience oh Assad, patience, we will dig your grave."" While the videos appeared to be from Syria, CNN was not able to independently verify their authenticity. The network's reporters had been barred until recently from officially entering Syria, and its reporting about events inside the country had been limited largely to what the network was able to piece together based on official government reports, witnesses in the country and accounts and videos posted on the Internet. Meanwhile, Syrian state TV reported that some of the thousands who fled to Turkey to escape a military offensive have begun to return to their homes. About 730 people returned to the town of Jisr al-Shugur, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported. But more than 11,400 Syrians are still in Turkey, the Turkish government said Sunday. SANA said some residents returned to find electricity, water and phone lines ransacked by armed groups. But opposition activists countered SANA's report, saying about 500 people were detained in neighboring villages and sent to Jisr al-Shugur ahead of the media's arrival. Jameel Saib, a Syrian activist who lives on the other side of the border in Turkey, said he saw an interview with an alleged shop owner of a store in Jisr al-Shugur but ""everyone knows that is not actually the man that owns the store."" Mohammed Fedo, another activist who lives on the Turkish side of the border, said about 300 to 400 Syrians returned to Jisr al-Shugur because conditions in the refugee camps in Turkey were unbearable. Fedo said residents who were returning to Jisr al-Shugur were reporting arrests and killings by security forces. Both activists said they had received reports from residents who said Syrian security forces had entered two towns, Najay and Habosh.  Fedo said residents were reporting that Syrian forces were firing indiscriminately. Haddad, the military spokesman, told CNN the military did enter Habosh but there was no evidence of violence, arrests or casualties. He denied security forces entered Najay. CNN cannot independently verify the claims of the activists or Haddad.

"Simferopol, Ukraine (CNN) -- Demonstrators clapped along to Soviet-era songs as dancers from Russia's Black Sea fleet entertained the masses at the center of Crimea's administrative capital Sunday. But it was more than just nostalgia for the old Soviet Union. With a controversial referendum over whether Crimea will remain part of Ukraine just a week away, it was a rallying cry for ethnic Russians gathered in Simferopol's Lenin Square. The large demonstration was the latest flashpoint as tensions simmer on the Crimean peninsula, which has become the epicenter of a battle for influence among Moscow, Kiev and the West since Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's ouster last month. Pro-Russian forces have pushed into the Black Sea peninsula in a bloodless siege, prompting criticism from Western nations and Ukraine's interim government. At Sunday's rally, throngs of people waved Crimean and Russian flags. And they said they want one thing: a union with Russia. Because of language and history, one man at the rally told CNN, Russia and Crimea are already ""brothers."" But not all Crimeans are convinced. Across town, beneath a statue of Ukraine's most celebrated poet, the crowd was much smaller, the mood much more somber. Asked what he thought about the possibility of Crimea becoming part of Russia, one demonstrator shook his head. ""It will be very complicated because of economics, and a lot of different nations live here, not only Russians. ... Not all of the people want to be part of Russia,"" he said. ""It's kind of show. Putin's show."" The rally was peaceful. But elsewhere, in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, another Ukrainian rally came under attack by pro-Russian gangs who whipped and beat demonstrators. In Kiev, thousands of people gathered at a rally for peace at the central Independence Square, the cradle of the protests that ousted Yanukovych. The crowd shouted slogans such as ""Glory for Ukraine"" and ""Putin go away"" as representatives of different religions prayed for a solution to the crisis. Putin speaks with Merkel, Cameron . While the autonomous Ukrainian region was the scene of emotional demonstrations by both sides, Russian President Vladimir Putin defended the breakaway moves by the pro-Russian leaders of Crimea in conversations with two world leaders on Sunday, . In separate phone calls with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister David Cameron, Putin underlined ""steps being taken by Crimea's legitimate authorities ... being based on international law on behalf of the interests of the population there,"" according to a Kremlin statement. Putin also said new Ukrainian authorities were doing nothing ""to curb ultra-nationalist and radical forces committing outrages"" in Kiev and other regions. The three leaders spoke amid tensions on the Black Sea peninsula that have escalated since the Moscow-backed regional parliament voted to leave Ukraine for Russia and announced a March 16 referendum to give Crimeans an opportunity to vote on the idea. Despite the differences of opinion over what is happening on the ground, the Kremlin statement said there was consensus on the need to de-escalate tensions and normalize the situation. It's unclear what could happen next in the tense standoff, but Sunday's phone conversations between Putin, Cameron and Merkel send one clear message, CNN analyst and Russian journalist Vladimir Pozner said. ""I think it shows that President Putin is very worried by the situation. I think speculation that he's trying to rebuild the Soviet empire are way off base,"" Pozner said. ""I think he knows all too well the necessity of Russia having an international relationship with the West. ... My hope is, with all the escalations going on, that there's a real chance of finding some way out of this very dangerous situation."" Moscow has denounced the events that led to Yanukovych's ouster as an illegitimate coup and has refused to recognize the new Ukrainian authorities, putting the two countries on a collision course over control of Crimea, which has longstanding ties to Russia and has thousands of Russian troops stationed there. Putin has said Russia has the right to protect Russians living in the former Soviet republic. Pro-Russian forces are now in de facto control of the region ahead of the referendum, which Kiev says is illegal. Washington has warned Moscow that any moves to annex Crimea would close the door to diplomacy. On Saturday, U.S. President Barack Obama rounded up world leaders to demand Russia ""de-escalate the situation."" Ukrainian interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk will fly to the United States this week to discuss the crisis in Crimea, as hostilities in the eastern European country's southern region intensify. Yatsenyuk is expected to arrive in the United States on Wednesday, a spokeswoman from his press office told CNN. The White House confirmed the visit and said the two will talk about the Russian military incursion and economic support for Ukraine. Referendum becomes focus . Putin last week secured permission from his parliament to use military force to protect Russian citizens in Ukraine. The move came within days after Yanukovych's flight from the country. Yanukovych was ousted after three months of protests against a decision to spurn a free trade deal with the European Union and turn toward closer ties with Moscow. A convoy of military vehicles, believed to be carrying Russian soldiers, traveled through Simferopol on Saturday, heading toward the border post at Armyansk, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense told CNN. Armyansk is one of the main access points into Crimea from the rest of Ukraine. Dozens of military observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe have tried to cross into Crimea for three days but have been refused entry by armed men. They did not attempt a crossing on Sunday. The referendum on whether the Crimean Peninsula should join Russia has become the focus of the Ukraine crisis. Yatsenyuk has called it ""an illegitimate decision."" ""If there is an annexation of Crimea, if there is a referendum that moves Crimea from Ukraine to Russia, we won't recognize it, nor will most of the world,"" U.S. deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""So I think you'd see, if there are further steps in the direction of annexing Crimea, a very strong, coordinated international response.""

"With one hand, Zahra Hassan clutches a purse that matches her red blouse and skirt trimmed in blue. In the other, she holds an AK-47. Peering through her blue veiled hijab, the traditional Muslim head cover, the petite 25-year-old watches as the man in a military uniform with no insignia shows her how to switch off the rifle's safety, take aim and fire. Then it's her turn. In red ballerina flats, she positions herself, levels the AK-47 toward a thick patch of date palms and pulls the trigger. Bang! The feel of the weapon discharging a round startles her a bit. ""Then you turn the safety on and lower the weapon,"" the man tells her. She follows his instruction. This is day one of a five-day course being offered by the Badr Brigade, a powerful Shiite militia with an estimated 10,000 members, to the wives, mothers, sisters and daughters of the group. MAPS: Iraqi towns, oil fields taken over by ISIS . Hassan is not training to go to the front line to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and its allied Sunni militants, but rather to defend her home if the terror group makes its way into Baghdad and ignites sectarian fighting in the streets. With most of the men in her family leaving home to volunteer to fight ISIS and its allies, Hassan says she has no choice now but to learn how to fight. ""I must do this,"" she says. More than 450 women have been through the training since the group started it this year, a step that was taken after ISIS began its battle for the flashpoint city of Falluja in Anbar province -- a battle that was a bellwether of things to come in Iraq. And thousands more are waiting, says Maj. Kareem Abdullah of the Badr Brigade, sitting in his office in a fortified compound in Yarmouk, a mixed Shiite-Sunni neighborhood in Baghdad. The number of women volunteers swelled in June after ISIS seized Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, and then began a march on the Iraqi capital, vowing to hit the city of more than 7 million people and overthrow the Shiite-dominated government. ""We are training these ladies to make them ready if (ISIS) makes it into their neighborhood,"" Abdullah said. ""They will be the ones who have to defend their home."" Who is the ISIS? Memories of past violence . Hassan remembers the sectarian fighting -- Shiite vs. Sunni, sometimes neighbor vs. neighbor -- at the height of the Iraq War that nearly tore the country apart. Her older brother, 36-year-old Ali Hassan, was among the thousands who reportedly disappeared during the fighting. The last time she ever saw him was the morning of May 28, 2007, when he left their home in Mahmoudiya, a Sunni-dominated city of about 500,000 people dubbed the ""Gateway to Baghdad"" because of its proximity to the Iraqi capital. She doesn't know what happened to him. But she and her family believe he was a victim of the sectarian fighting. ""Maybe somebody kidnapped him?"" she says, looking down at the gun in her hand. ""Maybe he was killed in an explosion?"" Ask any of the women, who range between the ages of 14 and 60, at the Badr Brigade training center if their family has a ""martyr"" -- somebody who has been killed in the fighting -- and nearly three-quarters of the hands go up. Ask if any of them know of anybody who's one, and everybody's hands go up. Jaffar Hassan is the man in the military uniform instructing the women. He is not related to Zahra Hassan, but she could be his daughter. By the time the week is done, he says, the women will be proficient enough to protect themselves and, if necessary, kill. Teen learning to protect her family . Fourteen-year-old Ageel Fadhil sits against the trunk of a towering date palm, listening to Hassan. An AK-47 lays across her lap. Her tender age is evident by the white hijab she wears. The other women, all older, wear hijabs in dark colors. Her mother, Shama, already knows how to use the weapon. She is an Iraqi police officer, one of the thousands of women who were trained in such roles when the U.S. military was standing up Iraq's military. She also was among the first to complete the Badr Brigade training, and today she is helping to instruct the women at the training center to handle the weapons. Ageel must learn how to protect the family, specifically her 7-year-old brother Ali, she says. ""When her father and I are at work, what is she going to do if someone comes in the house to kill them?"" With school out for the summer, most of Ageel's friends, she says, are watching television and reading magazines. She asked them to volunteer with her, but only a few did, she said. When its Ageel's turn to fire, she moves to the front of the group. ""So I take aim like this, and I get ready to fire,"" Hassan says, lifting the AK-47 and leveling it toward the trees. ""Then I fire."" He hands it to Ageel, who follows his instruction. She squeezes the trigger. Bang! Nice shot, he tells her. Her mother, wearing a green camouflage headscarf that matches her uniform, smiles at her and gently pats her on her back. It's not what a mother wishes for her daughter, Shama Fadhil said. ""But in Iraq, this is the reality."" By the end of the lesson, Ageel appears more at ease with the AK-47, cradling the weapon in her arm -- just like she has seen soldiers on the streets do. But could she kill somebody? Could she point the gun at somebody and pull the trigger? She thinks about the questions for a moment and then looks to her mother before she answers. ""If God wills it, yes,"" she says. READ MORE: Iraq's orphans struggle to survive . READ MORE: 'No reason to doubt' Baghdadi in Mosul .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Want to know where the presidential produce comes from? Washington's Bancroft Elementary School students help first lady Michelle Obama break ground on the garden. Take a walk past the White House. The answer may be planted right in front of you. First lady Michelle Obama helped break ground on a new White House organic ""kitchen garden"" Friday. It will be the first working garden at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. since Eleanor Roosevelt planted a so-called ""victory garden"" at the height of World War II. This time, however, the enemy is obesity. The first family is hoping to send a clear message to a fast food-driven nation that often seems to be losing the battle of the bulge. ""We're just hoping that a lot of families look at us and say this is something that they can do and talk to their own kids about and think a little bit critically about the food choices that they make,"" said Marian Robinson, the president's mother-in-law.  Watch Michelle Obama tell students about the garden » . The first lady told a group of Washington schoolchildren on hand for the occasion that first daughters Sasha and Malia Obama were usually more willing to try fresh fruits and vegetables because fresh produce generally tastes better. ""What I found with my kids [is that] if they were involved in planting it and picking it, they were much more curious about giving it a try,"" she added. ""I've been able to have my kids eat so many different things that they would have never touched if we had bought it at a store because they either met the farmers that grew it, or they saw how it was grown,"" she said. ""They were curious about it and ... usually they liked it."" The idea of a presidential kitchen garden, used year-round with different seasonal crops, has been strongly promoted by advocates for organic and locally grown food. They argue that the White House garden may help set a positive example for families short on time and money, who are often tempted by cheaper, highly processed food.

"Hong Kong, with its glittering skyscrapers and luxury malls, is home to some of the world's richest people but new government figures show that a fifth of its population lives in poverty. About 1.3 million people, or 19.6%, of the population were deemed to be living below the poverty line in 2012, according to the Hong Kong Povery Situation Report 2012 released on the weekend. It is the first time the city's government has set a poverty threshold, which stands at 50% of median household income before tax or welfare benefits. ""That poverty line marks an important milestone in our effort to alleviate poverty in Hong Kong,"" Matthew Cheung, Hong Kong's secretary for Labour and Welfare told CNN on Monday. ""We want to build a more caring, compassionate and inclusive society here."" Cheung said that Hong Kong's leader, Leung Chun-ying, would announce a package of measures early next year to help those struggling to make ends meet. ""We want to really tackle the problem of intergenerational poverty, social upward mobility is very important, promote employment and promote self-reliance,"" said Cheung. Leung, who took office in the former British colony last year, has pledged to narrow the city's gap between rich and poor, which is at a record high. Although part of China, Hong Kong has its own government and legal system. The city's Gini coefficient, which measures income equality, stood at 0.537 in 2011, the latest year that government figures are available, up from 0.533 in 2006. A reading above 0.4 suggests potential for social unrest. If welfare benefits such as social security assistance and old age allowance were included, Hong Kong's poverty rate would fall to 15.2% or 1.018 million people, the government's Commission on Poverty said. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief secretary for administration and chairman of the commission, said that the poverty line had limitations because household assets are not taken into account and this may overstate the number of people living in poverty. The 2012 poverty line for one-person households was set at a monthly income of 3,600 Hong Kong dollars ($464); 7,700 Hong Kong dollars ($993) for a two-person household, 11,500 Hong Kong dollars ($1,483) for a three-person household and 14,300 Hong Kong dollars ($1,844) for a four-person household.","A fifth of Hong Kong's population lives below official poverty line .

"Actress Elizabeth Peña died partly because of alcohol abuse, according to her death certificate, obtained by CNN. The certificate states ""cirrhosis of the liver due to alcohol""  as one of the causes of her death. The document also lists cardiopulmonary arrest, cardiogenic shock and acute gastrointestinal bleeding as the other causes. The 55-year-old actress' death shocked Hollywood and Peña's fans. She died October 14 in the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. In a report released earlier this year, the CDC says one in 10 deaths among adults between age 20 and 64 is due to excessive alcohol consumption. Peña is known for her recurring guest role as the mother of a character played by Sofia Vergara in the ABC sitcom ""Modern Family."" She also starred in films such as ""Down and Out in Beverly Hills,"" ""La Bamba,"" ""Rush Hour,"" and ""The Incredibles."" Her career spanned more than three decades. Peña was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, to parents who were from Cuba, and she graduated from New York's High School of Performing Arts in 1977.

"(CNN) -- A South Korean couple arrested for allowing their baby to starve to death had been raising an online child, state media reported citing police sources. The couple, residents of a Seoul suburb, allegedly neglected their prematurely born three-month-old daughter, feeding her just once a day in between 12-hour stretches at a neighborhood internet cafe, the official Yonhap news agency reported. Police said the couple had become obsessed with raising a virtual girl character called ""Anima"" in ""Prius Online"", a popular role-playing game in South Korea. ""The couple seemed to have lost their will to live a normal life, because they didn't have jobs and gave birth to a premature baby,"" said Chung Jin-won, a police officer. ""They indulged themselves in the online game of raising a virtual character so as to escape from reality, which led to the death of their real baby."" Professor Kwak Dae-kyung of Seoul's Dongguk University told the Yonhap news agency that the couple appeared to have lost track of reality. ""Online game addiction can blur the line between reality and the virtual world. It seems that taking care of their on-line game character erased any sense of guilt they may have had for neglecting their daughter."" Dae-kyung urged the government to prepare measures so that families and neighbors can contact local authorities or hospitals if anyone shows symptoms of online addiction.

"As if the deadly flooding inundating much of the Balkans wasn't alarming enough, rescuers must now grapple with another concern: the risk of landmines from the Bosnian war resurfacing. ""A vast number of landslides have worsened the situation and relief efforts,"" the Red Cross said, describing the rains as the ""worst floods in more than a century."" The epic flooding is the worst Serbia has seen since the country began keeping records 120 years ago, meteorologists said. ""There are reports that landmines buried during the conflict and not yet removed are in some instances being shifted with the landslides, adding (to) the dangers of people living in the areas as well as rescuers,"" the Red Cross said. ""We cannot say exactly what happened with the mine fields,"" Bosnian President Bakir Izetbegovic told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.  He warned that the mines were likely displaced in the flooding along with signs warning of mines in the area. ""The system of the mine fields (was) under control, and had warnings marks are now actually removed,"" Izetbegovic said. In the Serbian town of Obrenovac, at least 13 bodies have been recovered, and officials in Bosnia-Herzegovina said 13 people had died there so far.  Expert predict those numbers to rise as  flood waters recede. Even though the intense rainfall subsided Monday, the disaster is far from over. CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri said flooding in the region will last at least another week -- and in some places, it could get worse. The Serbian capital of Belgrade, for example, sits at the crux of the swollen Sava and Danube rivers. As water rushes downstream, the flood level in Belgrade is expected to rise through Thursday, Javaheri said. After a day of assessments, property damage alone is estimated a $1.37 billion (1 billion euros) said Elvir Camdzic, a presidential adviser. ""When combined with the overall economic losses due to the flooding, the full scale of the damage will be measured in billions of euros,"" Camdzic said. 'Happy that we didn't drown' In Serbia alone, more than 24,000 people have evacuated to escape water that is chest-high in some areas. Bosnian officials say 30,000 people are displaced in their country. ""People were in a panic, running,"" an evacuee told CNN affiliate N1 in Belgrade, Serbia. ""I left with a kid. I was really happy that we didn't drown."" The woman's house is now flooded, and she says she has no idea where she will live. But many Serbians wouldn't budge. ""Some people simply do not want to leave their homes,"" said Novica Biorac, a volunteer from a rafting club in Raska. ""We are trying to convince them to leave, but it's very difficult."" Farmland hit hard . Farmers along the Danube and Sava rivers are bracing for damage assessments as the rains have stopped.  The epic flooding followed an unusually dry winter that saw very little snowfall, meteorologists said. Agriculture, especially row crop production, is still one of the most important parts of Bosnia's economy and takes up 47% of the countries landmass,  according to a European Commission assessment. Small family farms populate about half of all agricultural lands and are essential for Bosnia's food security, according to the European Union.  Many of those farms are now under water, and massive landslides are a problem. ""This country is brutally destroyed by nature,"" said Zlatko Lagumdzija, Bosina's minister of foreign affairs.  ""The lanslides are absolutely destroying the country.  We have registered up to 2,000,"" he said. The World Food Programme said it plans to send food assistance to 150,000 people in Bosnia's most-affected areas. The organization is also sending food for 7,000  people in Serbia. Bosnia-Herzegovina is not yet a member of the European Union, but the EU is its largest agricultural trading partners, and EU representatives say they will aid in the recovery. ""We need an assessment from the government,"" said Ambassador Peter Sorensen, the EU Special Representative in Bosnia. ""We have ecological things with sewage, with water, with fuel and pesticides."" The EU will assist where it can, Sorensen said. Deadly situation . The Serbian government said one of the 13 dead was someone who had already died ""of natural causes,"" Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic said. One of the deceased was a rescuer, said Dragan Radovanovic, president of the Serbian branch of the Red Cross. Authorities estimate that 90% of Obrenovac has been flooded. Bosnian authorities say the flooded town of Maglaj received the average rainfall for two months in less than two days. ""Many cities and villages in western Serbia are completely under water,"" the Serbian Embassy in Washington said in a statement Sunday, describing the situation as an ""unimaginable catastrophe."" Fighting the flood . Soldiers, rescue workers and volunteers rushed to stack sandbags in towns near rivers throughout Serbia. The Sava River has already reached 6.3 meters (20.7 feet) -- a historic high, the Serbian government said. The Prime Minister said workers have erected a dam 7.3 meters (24 feet) tall in the area of Sabac. In Kostolac, along the Danube River, workers built sandbag walls to protect a thermal power plant -- one that the energy minister called the most important power facility in Serbia. The plant produces 20% of the nation's power. The Prime Minister thanked countries that have already come to Serbia's aid. He said he was especially grateful to members of the Russian special forces, including one member who swam 200 meters (656 feet) in cold water to save several people.

"(CNN) -- Actress Lena Dunham canceled several appearances to promote her new book after a self-described ""rage spiral"" over allegations that she molested her sister as a child. The allegations stem from passages in Dunham's collection of personal essays, ""Not That Kind of Girl,"" in which she describes sexually experimenting with her younger sister as a child. In one essay, she describes bribing her sister with three pieces of candy to kiss her on the lips for five seconds. She also describes probing her 1-year-old sister's vagina when she was 7 out of curiosity over how it compared to hers. ""One day, as I sat in our driveway in Long island playing blocks and buckets, my curiosity got the better of me. Grace was sitting up, babbling and smiling, and I leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina,"" she writes in the book. Kevin D. Williamson -- known for taking hard-right positions that stir controversy -- seized upon the passages in a column for conservative publication National Review. Specifically, he accused Dunham's parents of enabling ""disturbing behavior that would be considered child abuse in many jurisdictions ... sexual abuse, specifically, of her younger sister, Grace, the sort of thing that gets children taken away from nonmillionaire families without Andover pedigrees and Manhattanite social connections."" Truth Revolt's Ben Shapiro picked up the torch, calling the book passage ""disturbing."" Dunham, creator and star of the popular HBO show ""Girls,"" said she was ""dismayed"" over the interpretation of events described in her book. In a statement to Time magazine, she said she does not condone ""any kind of abuse under any circumstances."" ""Childhood sexual abuse is a life-shattering event for so many, and I have been vocal about the rights of survivors. If the situations described in my book have been painful or triggering for people to read, I am sorry, as that was never my intention."" Referring to her sister, she said, ""anything I have written about her has been published with her approval."" Over the weekend, Dunham fired back on Twitter, where she has 1.8 million followers, calling the allegations ""upsetting and disgusting."" Usually, ""this is stuff I can ignore,"" she said, ""... but don't demean sufferers, don't twist my words, back the f**k up bros."" Dunham then apologized on Twitter for canceling book tour appearances scheduled for this week in Berlin and Antwerp, Belgium. It was not clear Monday whether the cancellations were related to the recent allegations. Messages sent to Random House, Dunham's publisher, and her publicist were not immediately returned. Truth Revolt claims it received a ""cease and desist"" letter threatening legal action if the publication did not remove an article it published last week about Dunham. Dunham's sister, Grace Dunham, did not respond to requests for comment. Amid growing controversy Monday, however, she tweeted, ""2day, like every other day, is a good day to think about how we police the sexualities of young women, queer, and trans people."" .","NEW: Lena Dunham apologizes, says she is ""dismayed"" by reaction to book .

"The woman at the center of the Obamacare enrollment site, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  Administrator Marilyn Tavenner on Tuesday was the first government official to testify before Congress since the government's health insurance exchange went live on October 1. After nearly three hours of questions from both Republican and Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, here's what we learned: . 1. Finally, an apology . After four very tumultuous weeks of open enrollment, Tavenner became the first government official to publicly apologize for the rocky rollout of HealthCare.gov. Tavenner: Sorry for problems, but system working . ""We know that consumers are eager to purchase this coverage and to the millions of Americans who have attempted to use HealthCare.gov to shop and enroll in health care coverage, I want to apologize to you that the website has not worked as well as it should,"" Tavenner said during her opening remarks. President Barack Obama has admitted his frustration and Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has expressed regret, but on Tuesday, Tavenner accepted responsibility for the site's failures. ""Obviously, I'm accountable for this,"" she said later in the hearing. But Tavenner was insistent that the site is not beyond repair. ""I want to ensure you that HealthCare.gov can and will be fixed and we are working around the clock to deliver the shopping experience that you deserve,"" she said. ""We are seeing improvements each week, and as we said publicly, by the end of November, the experience on the site will be smooth for the vast majority of users."" Despite Tavenner's claims of responsibility for the program's failures, none of the members of the committee signaled that she should be reprimanded. On the other hand, more than 30 House Republicans and at least two prominent Republican members of the Senate have called for Sebelius' resignation. Why Sebelius will keep her job... for now . 2. Insurance plans are being canceled . No fewer than 10 Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee held up or cited letters sent to constituents saying that their health insurance plans were going away. Most of these legislators quickly followed up with references to a talking point at the center of Obama's pitch to consumers both before and after the Affordable Care Act was passed. ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan,"" the president repeated in speeches, weekly addresses and even the 2010 State of the Union address. At Tuesday's hearing, Republicans called that promise misleading. Keep your plan? Maybe not . Opinion: Canceled health plan is a good thing . Tavenner acknowledged that while some insurance companies had decided to stop offering certain plans on the individual market, the ACA did not force them to make that decision, and consumers whose plans have been canceled now have more comprehensive plans available to them. CNNMoney: Obamacare pricier for some individual buyers . ""If, in fact, the issuer has decided to change the plan -- it didn't have to,"" Tavenner said. ""Plans were grandfathered in in 2010 if they didn't make significant changes in cost-sharing and this sort of thing, they could keep the plans that they had."" Companies that decide to create new plans, Tavenner continued, must conform to new mandates under the ACA. These include a ban on rejections due to preexisting medical conditions, and new mandated benefits such as hospitalization, emergency services and maternity care. In response to repeated Republican questioning, Tavenner recommended that consumers who lose their coverage explore the options available to them on the new federal exchange. ""They can call the call center today and we will help them,"" Tavenner said. ""They can go online and if they're not successful we can help them through the call center. We also have people in their individual markets that can help them in person. So there are more methods than just the website. And I think that's important."" 3. Initial enrollment will be low . Since the ACA passed in 2010, Obama administration officials have pointed to the initial months of Massachusetts' health reform implementation as a predictor of how the nation-wide rollout might go. While repeatedly emphasizing that her agency wouldn't be releasing any enrollment information until mid-November, Tavenner used this example again on Tuesday as one reason why the first round of numbers might be lower than expected. ""We expect the initial number to be small,"" Tavenner said. ""And I think you've seen that in our projections, and that was the Massachusetts experience as well."" Later Tavenner expanded on that explanation saying, ""The Massachusetts experience was very slow initially and then it started to ramp up over time. We expect the same type of projections."" In recent days, White House officials have cited a study in the New England Journal of Medicine that found the vast majority of the consumers who enrolled in the first month of the Massachusetts health insurance exchanges were Medicaid eligible. The study found that just 123 premium-paying enrollees signed up in Massachusetts during the first month, compared with 10,000 people who signed up for Medicaid or plans with no premiums. 4. The partisan gulf remains wide -- and Democrats are standing by Obamacare . As Republican after Republican read testimonials from their constituents about the disastrous effects the Affordable Care Act is having on insurance policies, and the tortured experiences many have had trying to enroll online, the stories coming from Democrats were quite different. Supporters of the law acknowledged that the first month of open enrollment had been less than pleasant, but the stories they recounted had happy endings. California Democrat Rep. Xavier Becerra told the story of Andrew Striker, who waited three hours to purchase insurance online, but was happy with his insurance in the end. ""The good news for Mr. Striker is he's saving $6,000 as a result of being able to apply for the plan,"" Becerra said. ""So it's unacceptable for anyone to have to wait even three hours, and even though he says that he would have waited all day given the result he got, what we want is for everyone to experience the $6,000 savings -- maybe not that much, maybe more."" Rep. Danny Davis, a Democrat from Illinois, used his time to list off statistics demonstrating the successes of open-enrollment in his state. The most passionate defense of the health care law came from New Jersey Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell, who chastised Republicans for trying to kill the law rather than working to improve it, as Democrats had done when faced with health reform they opposed, President George W. Bush's Medicare Part D. ""We lost the policy fight, and what did we do?  We went back to our districts and we told our seniors although we voted no, we personally believe -- and will work with the Bush administration to make it work, that's what we did,"" Pascrell said, standing from his chair to face his colleagues. ""And how many of you stood up to do that? None. Zero. Zero."" 5. Capacity is improving . In a statement that galled many Republicans on the committee, Tavenner said that despite all of its hiccups and inconsistencies, HealthCare.gov is currently functioning. ""The system is working,"" she said. ""We'd like for it to work better and that's what we've committed to do by the end of November."" Will the young and healthy use healthcare.gov? Security hole found in Obamacare website . For weeks, administration officials have said that performance is improving every day, and on a conference call with reporters on Tuesday afternoon CMS officials gave an update on consumers' ability to create an account on HealthCare.gov, a major bottleneck in the site's early days. ""Now we are able to process nearly 17,000 registrants per hour, or five per second, with almost no error rates,"" CMS communications director Julie Bataille said on the call. ""So that's the number of individuals who are completing that full account creation process, that first step in the application.""","Woman at center of Obamacare website is first official to apologize for rocky rollout .

"(CNN) -- Derek Jeter's nicknames: ""The Captain,"" ""Captain Clutch,"" ""Mr. November."" -- baseball-reference.com .

This week begins ""what can only be called Derek Jeter Week in Major League Baseball."" -- a story from Newsday . I don't know anybody who has called this Derek Jeter Week in Major League Baseball. * * * . ""How Should Derek Jeter Leave the Field in His Last Game at Yankee Stadium?"" -- a headline from USA Today . Uh, I don't know ... on foot? * * * . Derek Jeter, baseball player, is not nearly as big a deal as a lot of New Yorkers think he is. I know people with no clue how big he is. Literally. ""How tall would you guess Derek Jeter is?"" I asked a baseball fan from L.A. ""Hmmm,"" she said. ""Five-foot-10?"" No, he is 6-foot-3. Everything else you've ever wanted to know about Derek Jeter, you could be about to find out. TV, radio, blogs, magazines, newspapers. smartphones and carrier pigeons based in New York City are treating this, Jeter's last week of playing Major League Baseball, as slightly less monumental than the discovery of America in 1492. Queeg, Bligh, Cook, Phillips, Marvel, America and Crunch are just a few of the Captains now considered by many New Yorkers to be not as big as theirs. But you know what? Californians aren't obsessing over these being Jeter's last days of playing ball. Texans or Minnesotans or Ohioans or Floridians, either. I mean, they LIKE him and all. A really fine athlete. A really fine guy, too, it seems. Scandal-free. A class act, people in and out of baseball tend to agree. The Anti-A-Rod. Should a fuss be made over his retirement? Of course. A warm sendoff definitely is in order. A standing O. A lovely parting gift. A tip of thousands of caps. A wobble of thousands of bobbleheads. But, man oh man, is New York going completely wacko overboard or what? I expect any minute for the mayor there -- what's his name, the tall guy who came after Bloomberg -- to announce that a certain other tall piece of work is being renamed The Jeter State Building. It wouldn't surprise me if future New Jersey commuters come to town through the Jeter Tunnel or catch a helicopter at Jeterboro. I have booked a flight east for 2015 that probably will include a connection at Kennedy-Jeter. They've done everything in NYC except stage a new Broadway version of ""Damn Yankees"" in which Washington's team loses because a young Derek Jeter wants to be a Yankee so much, he sells his soul to the devil. Or a new version of ""Bye, Bye Birdie,"" now that he's leaving, with the lyrics changed to: ""We love you, Derek, oh, yes we do! We love you, Derek, and we'll be true. When you're not near to us, we're blue. Oh, Derek, we love you!"" American sports fans from Alabama to Alaska are not stricken with this Jeter-mania the way New Yorkers are. He's big, but not that big. A lot of Europeans and Asians wouldn't know Derek Jeter from Darth Vader. Did he have a great career? No doubt about it. Opinion: Baseball's humble hero . If you know your baseball, you must be impressed that Derek Jeter has had more hits in his career than Willie Mays, Barry Bonds, Lou Gehrig, Ted Williams or Babe Ruth did. A bat stat I like, for the amusement or amazement of you baseball lovers out there, is this one: Derek Jeter already has more hits than Jackie Robinson and Mark McGwire did combined. I repeat, COMBINED. For the past 20 years, the shortstop for the New York Yankees, the most successful organization in American baseball, has been a kid who played his high school ball in Kalamazoo, Michigan, on his way to fame and fortune in the big city. In most of the United States of America, baseball fans seem to consider Derek Jeter a great player. In the largest city in the United States of America, baseball fans seem to consider Derek Jeter a visitor from the planet Krypton. Well, to each his own. No one anywhere would dare argue that Jeter is undeserving, or overrated, or ""maybe"" a Hall of Famer. On the contrary, this guy is a rarity in this day and age, a certain Hall of Famer. A mortal lock. I admire him. I met him, interviewed him, liked him. One day in 2008, I got him for a while in Chicago one-on-one. We were chatting about the New Yankee Stadium under construction, a work in progress, and Jeter said enthusiastically: ""It'll look just like the old one, except with 500,000 more feet of space."" I remember saying Wrigley Field ought to think the same way. ""Exactly,"" Jeter said. I later asked Ozzie Guillen, a successful Chicago White Sox shortstop and manager, what he thought of Jeter. ""The perfect man,"" he replied. Oh? In what way? ""Derek Jeter has everything in life,"" Guillen said. ""He's got money, he's got rings, he's ...."" A pause before the punchline. ""....not married."" That got a laugh. ""Too bad I don't have a daughter,"" Guillen added. The off-the-field life of Derek Jeter brought a smile to our faces that day, as the on-the-field one has to many since. He's been a New York Yankee his whole professional life. He was drafted in June, 1992 -- Houston, Cleveland, Montreal, Baltimore and Cincinnati picked first but took somebody else -- and made his Major League debut in a May 29, 1995, indoor game before a ""crowd"" of 18,948 fans in Seattle, batting ninth in the Yankee lineup that day. Wade Boggs, Randy Velarde and Don Mattingly were in the infield with him. He went 0-for-5 and the Yanks lost. Thousands of hits later, Jeter is retiring and his uniform number 2 will be put out to pasture as well. (A guy named Mike Gallego was the last Yankee to wear it before him.) Those hits include a walk-off home run that won Game 4 of the 2001 World Series on a Halloween night. It came after midnight, therefore technically becoming the first World Series homer ever struck in the month of November. He became ""Mr. November"" to somebody that night, a name absolutely nobody has known him by since. ""The Captain"" is what Yankee fans do call him. A promotion to admiral could be in order. Thursday is his last scheduled game at Yankee Stadium. A weekend of games in Boston follows that, and that's that. Admirable player, admirable career. King of the hill, top of the heap. Not THAT big a deal? OK, OK, so maybe he IS even bigger than some of us think.

"The Indian Uber driver accused of raping a passenger in New Delhi is awaiting trial in at least four criminal cases in his home state, a police official said Wednesday. The cases against Shiv Kumar Yadav in Uttar Pradesh date to 2003, said Superintendent Srikant Singh, a senior police official in the state. Yadav is currently in police custody in New Delhi, where he is accused of raping a 26-year-old woman who had requested a ride through the car service app last weekend. Police in New Delhi say Yadav's address and background weren't verified in his driver registration. The revelations from Uttar Pradesh police add to concerns about how he was allowed to operate as a driver for Uber. Yadav was accused of rape last year and later released on bail, Singh said. He was also arrested on charges of molestation in 2003, of carrying illegal firearms in 2006 and of disorderly and dangerous behavior in 2009, according to Singh. In New Delhi, he spent seven months in jail in between 2011 and 2012 during a trial on charges of rape of which he was acquitted, said the city's deputy police commissioner, Madhur Verma. The accusations of rape in the Uber car has provoked a sharp response from Indian authorities. New Delhi says it has banned the car service, citing permit violations, and police say they have filed a case against it. The Indian federal government has advised states to block unlicensed Web-based taxi services. Uber has condemned the alleged rape and said it is cooperating with Indian law enforcement authorities. The company said that as of Tuesday, it hadn't been notified of the New Delhi ban and was continuing to operate in the city. Uber wasn't immediately available for comment Wednesday on the disclosures about Yadav's record in Uttar Pradesh, but on Thursday it released a statement saying it was doing everything in its power ""to assist the authorities to help bring the perpetrator to justice."" The company will suspend its operations in New Delhi, it said, as it re-evaluates its verification processes and begins ""re-reviewing rider feedback on every driver partner across India."" It also will address its driver-screening processes and will evaluate options like background checks on all drivers in India, beyond what the law requires. ""We will come back better and stronger for the New Delhi community, ready to serve you again,"" Uber said in the statement.","Uber suspending operations in New Delhi, re-evaluating screening processes .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- By day, thousands of protesters marched through the streets of Cairo, chanting against the country's president and calling for his resignation. By night, some defied a government curfew and took to the streets again -- armed with guns, swords and sticks to fend off looters and protect their homes. Many streets in the nation's capital were left without security after police stopped patrolling. Kareem Amer told CNN that houses in his Cairo neighborhood had been ransacked. ""We've been hearing gunshots left and right all night long. ... The men of each household have come down and formed their own group militias holding down security for every building,"" he said. Ahmed Rehab of the Council on American Islamic Relations said the atmosphere was tense. ""It seems that every major square and every small street in Cairo was basically taken over by communities ... people are parading the streets, walking around with baseball bats and knives,"" he said from Cairo. ""We didn't get any sleep all night."" State-run Nile TV reported that the military issued a stern warning to the people on Saturday: ""Stop the looting, chaos and the things that hurt Egypt. Protect the nation, protect Egypt, protect yourselves."" Still, shops and businesses were looted and abandoned police stations stripped clean of their arsenals. Cairo's Egyptian Museum stepped up security after vandals ripped the heads off two mummies and tossed relics onto the ground, the country's antiquities chief said Sunday. On Sunday, state-run Nile TV aired images of men confessing to involvement in looting. A school teacher said he had been involved in looting at a Cairo museum. Three other said they had stolen items from a supermarket in a suburb of the city. Roughly 1,000 inmates escaped from Prison Demu in Fayoum, southwest of Cairo, Nile TV reported early Sunday. Residents calling in to a program on Nile TV complained about the absence of security. Anchors responded by reassuring callers that the army was protecting the streets. ""Those thugs are setting things on fire. ... They are setting fire in front of the hospital,"" a caller identifying herself as a doctor in a Cairo neighborhood said. One anchor replied, ""This might be a security check from your colleagues or the workers who are there."" Another anchor told her to remain calm. On the streets overnight, stories swirled about would-be criminals and vigilante justice. ""Citizens...have taken justice into their own hands because, as you can see here, the state has completely failed us. The regime has completely failed in being able to provide basic security,"" Amer said.","""We've been hearing gunshots left and right all night long,"" one Cairo resident says .

"In the poor suburbs of Casablanca, Morocco's largest city, home-grown hip-hop artists blare from radios, clubs and street corners around the clock. Unlike the majority of their commercial American counterparts, these rappers don't talk much about women, partying and luxury lifestyles; but poverty, illiteracy, crime, and the high cost of living. According to a recent report from the World Bank, nearly half of young Moroccans are either unemployed or out of school. For 28-year-old rapper Mohammed Hoummas, who goes by the stage name Si Simo,  the situation reflects a growing inequality between Morocco's rich and poor. Indeed, his most popular song, ""Kilimini"" speaks directly of the wealth gap in Moroccan society. ""They have croissant for breakfast while we eat bread dipped in cheap oil. They dine on grilled meat while we fight over an ounce of meat like worms,"" he sings. ""Why did I write 'Kilimini?' Look around where I live and you'll understand why I wrote it. To say it simply: Here in Morocco the people who have power, they can do what they want, say what they want, and no one will judge them or say anything to them,"" he said. As a child Si Simo listened to Bob Marley and was inspired to write his own music. He says he couldn't afford to buy a guitar so his words became his instrument, and he started rapping at 15. ""I expressed my feelings about things I lived through, the things that hurt me, the life experiences that marked me,"" he said. Internet penetration in Morocco has increased from just 15% of the population in 2007, to 49% in 2011, according to Internet World Statistics. As such, the country's rap and hip-hop scene has exploded in popularity in urban centers -- where internet access is highest -- as home-grown artists take advantage of the ability to share and distribute their productions more widely. National festivals such as Casablanca's Casa Music Festival and capital city Rabat's Mawazine increasingly showcase the talents of both domestic and international musicians, including the likes of Busta Rhymes and Kanye West. Now a stalwart on the scene, Si Simo gained fame with the rap group Fez City Clan, making enough money from concerts and touring to move out of his run-down neighbourhood in Casablanca. He still  returns regularly, and is regarded as a local success story and inspiration. ""I listen to rap and fusion music, but mostly rap, and especially Si Simo because he's from this neighborhood,"" said a local man. ""I'm 19 and I'm a rapper. I think hip-hop is a way to express ourselves. I think it can change a lot of things,"" said another. But that change can come at a price. In February of last year, as the Arab Spring swept across the region, pro-reform protests erupted across Morocco. The government reacted swiftly.  Morocco's king, Mohammed VI, announced several reforms, including new parliamentary elections, civic and social equality for women,  and recognition of the indigenous Berber language as an official state language along with Arabic. But for many, especially among Morocco's disenchanted young, it wasn't enough. Rapper Mouad Belghouat, better known as ""Al Haqed"" (""The Enraged One""), became a figurehead for the pro-reform February 20 Movement when he was arrested in March 2011 for his song ""Kilab Al Dawla"" or ""Dogs of the State,"" in which he criticizes the police for brutality and corruption. ""You are paid to protect the citizens, not to steal their money,"" read the lyrics. ""Did your commander order you to take money from the poor?"" The song asks the police to arrest the wealthy businessmen who, he says, have divided the country up for themselves. A Casablanca court sentenced Belghouat to one year in prison for hurting the image of the police. The conviction drew widespread criticism from Belghouat's supporters on both his website and on social media outlets, as well as condemnation from Human Rights Watch, among others. For Ali Chabani, a Moroccan sociology professor, the discontentment expressed in the lyrics of Morocco's growing band of hip hop artists is an inevitable product of the country's lack of social unity: . ""The youth started suffering from unemployment, they started feeling marginalized and found it difficult to afford a dignified life or to establish themselves in society and so began to feel excluded,"" he said.

"The first sign there was a problem Friday with Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo came at about 45,000 feet, just two minutes after the spaceplane separated from the jet-powered aircraft that carried it aloft, officials said. It wasn't something overt with SpaceShipTwo, said Stuart Witt, the chief executive of Mojave Air & Space Port in California, where SpaceShipTwo was launched and monitored. It was what didn't happen next during the test flight, he said. Witt did not offer details, but appeared to indicate the spaceplane did not follow its previous test-flight patterns. Nothing seemed abnormal during the takeoff or flight prior to the spaceplane's failure, he told reporters. ""...If there was a huge explosion, I didn't see it,"" Witt said. According to Witt and others, one pilot is dead and another has been hospitalized with serious injuries. The injured pilot was airlifted to Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster, authorities said. Virgin Galactic conducted ""extensive ground testing of all parts of the spaceship,"" said Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group. ""We've always known that the road to space is extremely difficult -- and that every new transportation system has to deal with bad days early in their history,"" Branson said in a statement as he was en route to the firm's Mojave site. The pilot who is hospitalized parachuted to the ground, Virgin Galactic said. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of all those affected by this tragic accident,"" it said. The two pilots worked for Scaled Composites, according to that company's president, Kevin Mickey. He declined to publicly identify the pilots or detail their experience. ""Space is hard, and today was a tough day. We are going to be supporting the investigation as we figure out what happened today, and we are going to get through it,"" Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides said. ""The future rests in many ways on hard, hard days like this."" Virgin Galactic has planned for years to sell trips in which SpaceShipTwo transports passengers about 62 miles above Earth -- the beginning of outer space -- and lets them experience a few minutes of weightlessness before returning to ground. News of the crash of SpaceShipTwo came just after 10 a.m. local time (1 p.m. ET). The incident occurred over the Mojave Desert shortly after SpaceShipTwo separated from WhiteKnightTwo, the vehicle designed to carry it aloft, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The jet-powered WhiteKnightTwo returned safely to the Mojave Air & Space Port, Witt said. Said Branson: ""This was the latest part of an extensive test flight program, and the 55th time SpaceShipTwo had flown. It was WhiteKnightTwo's 173rd flight and the 35th time SpaceShipTwo had flown freely."" Television footage from CNN affiliate KABC-TV in Los Angeles showed SpaceShipTwo in pieces in the Mojave Desert. Questions are being raised about a new fuel mixture used after Mickey said it had been ground-tested a number of times, but Friday's flight was the first time it was used in a test flight. The National Transportation Safety Board is sending a ""go team"" to investigate the test flight failure, the agency said. The NTSB is leading the investigation with FAA support, under a voluntary cooperative agreement between the agencies, the FAA said. The FAA regulates the U.S. commercial space transportation industry, and the agency's Office of Commercial Space Transportation provides compliance monitoring and safety inspectors for each FAA-authorized launch, the agency said. ""Regulations require that crew members are aware of the inherent risks involved in the operation and acknowledge them,"" the FAA said. Deadly day for space tourism -- but future 'rests' on such days, official says . In a written statement, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden offered his condolences to the family of the pilot killed in the test flight failure. ""While not a NASA mission, the pain of this tragedy will be felt by all the men and women who have devoted their lives to exploration,"" Bolden said. ""Spaceflight is incredibly difficult, and we commend the passion of all in the space community who take on risk to push the boundaries of human achievement."" It's unclear what the failure of the spaceplane will mean for the program. Virgin Galactic planned to send paying customers on SpaceShipTwo as early as 2015. Virgin has sold more than 700 tickets, each costing more than $250,000, for future flights. Several celebrities have already signed up, including Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher, Leonardo DiCaprio and Stephen Hawking. With composite lightweight materials, ""feathered"" rudders capable of turning 90 degrees and a hybrid rocket engine, SpaceShipTwo is as safe as modern technology can make it. As designer and aviator Burt Rutan put it in 2008, ""This vehicle is designed to go into the atmosphere in the worst case straight in or upside down and it'll correct."" Opinion: The truth about launching spaceships . Details of Friday's test flight plan were not immediately known. But in previous test flights, SpaceShipTwo has been  loaded on the jet-powered WhiteKnightTwo, which can take the spaceplane to about 50,000 feet before the spaceplane is released to fly free. At that altitude, SpaceShipTwo would then fire its RocketMotorTwo, a hybrid rocket engine powered by both solid and liquid fuel. SpaceShipTwo would reach supersonic speeds on its way to its intended altitude of about 62 miles above the Earth. At that point, people onboard would get about five minutes of weightlessness before the bonds of Earth retract with 6 G's of force. The spaceplane would then glide back through the atmosphere to landing. Friday's is the second incident in a week involving the commercial space industry. On Tuesday, an unmanned Antares rocket exploded just after takeoff off the coast of Virginia. Controllers deliberately destroyed the craft after it became apparent there was a problem, a spokesman for Orbital Sciences Corp. said Thursday. Will rocket's failure set back the private space industry?","Pilot who is hospitalized parachuted to the ground .

"The biggest waves in a decade are pounding Hawaii's North Shore. Visitors and locals alike marveled in their wake -- 40 to 50 feet high at Oahu, according to the National Weather Service. ""It's crazy,"" Peter Panais of Canada told CNN affiliate KHON.  ""Honestly, these are probably the biggest waves I've ever seen in my entire life."" The ocean swells have plenty of wow factor. ""I've got some mates back in Aussie that I've already sent videos to, who keep asking for more videos, more videos,"" said Australian visitor Micka Murphy.  ""They want to see more."" But even the locals were impressed by the powerful waves. ""It's a spectacle. It's incredible,"" North Shore resident Daniela Power said.  ""It's so big and massive and powerful and it's really a special thing to watch for sure."" Share video of the waves with CNN iReport if you can capture it safely . The heavy surf peaked Wednesday night, but waves were still supposed to reach 30 to 40 feet on Thursday.  A high surf advisory will be in place until Friday morning. Hawaii hasn't experienced waves this large since 2004, said Sam Houston, a forecaster with the weather service. Surfing event canceled . The massive waves would appear to be a surfer's paradise, but organizers of a big wave surf contest postponed this week's event.  Although they said the waves measured up, the wind conditions didn't. ""We have taken all the time we can to assess the developments of the next big swell and it does not look favorable for us,"" event organizer Glen Moncata said at the beginning of the week. ""The size is there, but the quality is not, due to strong, adverse winds."" World's 50 best surf spots . Organizers of the big wave event said they will keep waiting until the end of February for ""just one day of quality surf"" when wave face heights reach around 40 feet. The contest is held in honor of Eddie Aikau, a famous Oahu lifeguard who was regarded as one of the best big wave surfers of the 1960s and '70s. Aikau disappeared in 1978 during a canoe expedition from Hawaii to Tahiti. The event -- the Quiksilver In Memory of Eddie Aikau big wave invitational -- isn't an annual occurrence. It has taken place eight times, starting in 1984. It was last held in December 2009 when Greg Long of California claimed victory. The invitees to this year's event include Long, Aiku's younger brother Clyde, 11-time world champion Kelly Slater and Carlos Burle, who gained global renown for surfing an enormous wave in Portugal last year. Why such huge waves? A large storm with hurricane-force winds is spinning far north of the islands, but is sending a giant swell toward the warning areas, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. Althought fun to watch, the big waves are prompting concern among beachfront home owners whose houses risk being flooded or are on cliffs vulnerable to erosion. The American Red Cross says it has volunteers and supplies on standby for any homes that are affected, CNN affiliate KHNL/KGMB reported.

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Here's something liberals and conservatives have in common: It may soon be the case that neither camp will have Rahm Emanuel to kick around anymore. Now it's time to give Chicago, Illinois, voters a chance to do some kicking of their own. We can start with those Chicagoans who support immigration reform and believe that both Congress and the Obama administration should be ashamed for putting off a tough debate for the sake of politics. These folks might soon have a chance to channel that anger at a Washington insider who those closest to the immigration debate have always seen as one of the main obstacles to reform --Emanuel. That is, if there is any truth to what various news outlets are reporting this week -- that the White House chief of staff will soon resign and head home to Chicago to run for mayor. If he does, the immigration issue will be waiting to greet him. That will be especially true if Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez, perhaps the most outspoken supporter of comprehensive immigration reform in Congress, also jumps into the mayor's race. This is a real possibility, and, if it happens, we can expect fireworks: Gutierrez has never been shy about blasting Emanuel over immigration reform. It's great poetry. When it comes to what is perhaps the most divisive issue that Americans have confronted since slavery, Emanuel should have learned by now that you can run but you can't hide. He has been on the run from immigration reform since the debate resurfaced in 2005 with the introduction of the McCain-Kennedy comprehensive reform bill. Emanuel spent that year whipping up support among Democrats for the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act, a terribly unimaginative enforcement-only bill proposed by then-House Judiciary Chairman James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin. Among other things, the bill made unauthorized presence in the United States a felony and threatened to punish, as accomplices, churches and other charities that offer assistance to illegal immigrants. The measure passed the House, but the Senate never acted on it. In 2006, when Democrats took control of both houses of Congress, Emanuel became House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's top lieutenant. There again, he worked hard to keep the immigration issue off the Democratic agenda because he feared it could put him and his colleagues in a tough spot. According to The Washington Post, Emanuel decided that the issue was a loser for Democrats and so he tried to bury it. Emanuel failed the leadership test, even if he was correct in his political analysis. The issue divided two loyal Democratic constituencies: Latinos, who wanted reform, and organized labor, which didn't want reform if it meant supporting demands from the business community for guest workers. Unions claimed guest workers undermined U.S. workers. It left liberal Democrats vulnerable, because immigration is one of those issues where some of their liberal constituents sound more like conservatives. It also threatened ""blue dog"" Democrats representing conservative districts, several of whom Emanuel had personally recruited to run for Congress in the first place. It was no surprise when the Chicago Democrat declared immigration the new ""third rail"" in politics (you touch it, you die) and pushed the issue so far to the back burner that it nearly fell off the stove. Capitol Hill newspapers reported shouting matches between Emanuel and members of the Democratic-controlled Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who failed to get leaders of their party to tackle the issue. Emanuel continued ducking the immigration issue when he became President Obama's chief of staff in early 2009, and it might be that he has helped Obama do the same thing. Despite repeated promises that he intends to achieve comprehensive immigration reform (these promises are usually delivered before Latino audiences on Mexican holidays), Obama has been derelict. While the president was willing to go the mat for health care reform, he obviously doesn't care as much about immigration. And it shows. In fact, as tempting as it is to blame Emanuel for taking immigration reform off the president's agenda, it might not be totally fair. Some in the immigration reform community naively assume that the only reason they haven't gotten as much as they expected from this administration is because Emanuel has been secretly plotting against their interests. It's better to believe that than to take a peek behind door No. 2 and accept the hard truth that Obama is the one who betrayed them. Either way, Rahm Emanuel has a lot of explaining to do to Latinos when he gets back to Chicago about his commitment to the immigration issue -- or lack thereof. They deserve answers, and they should demand them. And if the response doesn't satisfy their concerns, they should take their votes elsewhere. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette notes Rahm Emanuel may run for Chicago mayor .
Immigration reformers there may be unimpressed with his past obstruction on issue, he says .
If Rep. Gutierrez, immigration reform supporter, also decides to run, expect fireworks .

"On Tuesday, the international community reacted to North Korea's third nuclear test by calling its action ""provocative,"" while South Korea's foreign minister warned that it was a ""clear threat to international peace and security."" It was what Kim Jong Un, the nation's young leader, wanted. From the North Korean government's view, the more pressure the international community places on its nuclear testing, the better.  They enjoy the chatter among the world's leaders and at the U.N. about how North Korea's nuclear program must be stopped at all cost. On January 23, the North Korean foreign ministry notified that they intended to carry out a  test. They also sent photos of Kim Jong Un holding a meeting with senior officials. If Kim had not acted by going through with the underground blast, it would have appeared that he had succumbed to pressure from the international community. In North Korea the authority of the ""king"" in the dynasty system cannot be compromised. The date of the nuclear test -- conducted on February 12 -- is also significant, as it fell just days short of the 71st birthday of Kim's late father, Kim Jong Il, on February 16. Many North Korean events are associated with symbolic dates for the Kim family. On December 12, just days before the first anniversary of Kim Jong II's death, Pyongyang launched its first rocket into orbit -- despite international uproar. North Korea has staked its pride on these events. Saving face is more important than international sanctions, even if hundreds of thousands of ordinary North Koreans have died of hunger. Even so, I cannot say the motivation behind North Korea's nuclear test is for Kim's pride alone. It also sends a message to its people that ""Kim Jong Un leads the world."" Even with the nuclear test, the government knows that war will not arise. But to its people, it can give the impression that war is impending. Inheriting his father's position at such a young age -- he's believed to be in his 20s --  many in North Korea may question whether Kim has the clout to lead. But through this test, Kim wanted to send a strong message domestically that he is in charge. What happens if they do develop an effective nuclear weapon? Does North Korea intend to attack the United States? That is impossible. If North Korea attacks, it will be sent back to the Stone Ages -- the leadership in Pyongyang is well aware of that. Does this point to an eventual attack on South Korea then? South Korea is protected by a nuclear umbrella -- meaning that the United States will protect it. In return for Seoul limiting its own nuclear weapons capability, Washington offers its protection. If North Korea attacks South Korea, it's effectively an attack on the United States. Another major reason why North Korea is developing a nuclear capability is that its conventional military is dated and there are doubts about whether it can defend itself. While North Korea has an estimated 1.2 million soldiers, making it the third largest military behind China and United States, this is only a number. It may be hard to believe but for almost 20 years, there have been continued food shortages in the military, to the extent that as many as 20% to 30% of the armed forces have actually disappeared -- with many deserting their post by way of a bribe to their superiors. Those that do remain in service are often involved in petty crime to get by, such as stealing from the civilian population. North Korea requires military service for 10 years. During those years, most are discharged without even having fired 30 bullets. Without sufficient fuel for planes, airborne troops have not had much training. In 1990, I stood guard at a post in Pyongyang. The anti-aircraft weapon I used was a 1940s era model from the Soviet Union. If war is to occur, North Korea could not stand, even for days, and it is well aware of that. But could it count on traditional ally, China, for support? Starting from Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea, the North Korean regime has never fully trusted China. The message that China is a nation that could strike North Korea at the ""back of the head"" has been passed down over the years to Kim Jong Un, his grandson. Since North Korea cannot count on Beijing fully, it has turned to the nuclear option as a deterrent. North Korea would not risk a pre-emptive attack on the South, but the Kim dynasty now believes it has a card to protect itself, which is its main objective. For this reason, even if millions of people starve to death in the effects of the harsh sanctions, North Korea will keep trying to develop its own nuclear capabilities.","North Korea enjoys international community chatter about its nuclear program .

"Don't you hate it when the weatherman gets it wrong? Apparently, so does Kim Jong Un. According to state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun, the North Korean leader has been touring meteorological facilities in his country complaining that there are ""too many incorrect"" weather forecasts. As further proof of the supreme leader's extreme displeasure, the Rodong Sinmun report includes photos of a red-faced Kim chastising what appear to be sheepish meteorological personnel. The wording of the report is a little unclear at times, but it claims Kim's concerns about the weather relate to its potential impact on the economy. Blaming outdated equipment and scientific method, the young leader stressed a need for accurate forecasts to protect people's lives and property from ""abnormal climatic phenomenon"" (sic) and to safeguard industries like agriculture and fisheries from natural disasters in a timely manner, according to Rodong Sinmun. North Korea has suffered severe food shortages under the rule of the Kim family. In May, state media reported that the reclusive country was experiencing its worst spring drought in more than 30 years, damaging thousands of acres of staple crops. Around two-thirds of North Korea's 24 million people face chronic food shortages, which are exacerbated by floods, droughts and mismanagement, according to the United Nations.

"It might be one of the world's worst polluting energy sources, but coal has allowed South Africa to become the continent's largest economy, according to the chief executive of the country's power utility company Eskom. Speaking to CNN's Robyn Curnow, Eskom's Brian Dames said coal has been key to fueling South Africa's economic growth and improving the lives of many in the country. ""We've been very successful in the use of coal in growing one of the largest economies, in bringing electricity to the majority of South Africans -- we're absolutely not defensive about it,"" said Dames. South Africa gets 86% of its energy from coal and, despite the criticism that it is bad for the environment -- when burned, coal emits more air pollution and greenhouse gases than other major energy sources -- Dames argued that South Africa will continue to use the natural resource. An edited version of the interview follows below. CNN: Why is coal important for South Africa? Brian Dames: It's about energy security first and foremost for us, it's about affordable energy, it's about energy access. You would agree with me without those three things there is no economic growth, no poverty alleviation, no job creation in any of our economies. And then it is about, as we do this, how we can do it in a more cleaner manner and at the same time make sure we deal with issues such as job creation -- can we create green jobs -- so we're very clear as to where we want to go and what the balance is and that commitment is there -- it is there to move towards a lower carbon footprint over time. Read more: Is South Africa addicted to coal? CNN: What percentage of energy do you get from coal? BD: It's more than 80%, about 86% of the energy, and it has put us in a position as a company and as a country to really fuel the economic growth in South Africa. That's why this country has got the largest economy on the African continent, that's why we operate one of the world's 10 largest power companies. CNN: Eighty per cent of all your energy comes from coal -- that is dirty energy and South Africa is the biggest producer of coal in the world. Don't you find that difficult in terms of charting a green future? BD: No, it is not difficult. We should be quite clear, because South Africa's emissions is about 1.5% of global emissions, the continent's emissions is about 3% of global emissions, it's less than 200 times than what's in the U.S. What you're asking us to do is not do that, not have electricity, not have energy security and not have energy access. CNN: I think the reality is Eskom relies heavily on coal, South Africa historically has relied heavily on coal to produce its electricity. Why do you seem a bit defensive about it? BD: No, we're not defensive, absolutely not. Coal has been used very successfully and will be used in future in South Africa. It's a natural resource that we have, we've been very successful in the use of coal in growing one of the largest economies, in bringing electricity to the majority of South Africans -- we're absolutely not defensive about it. Banker: Spending on climate change makes good business sense . CNN: But it is dirty energy and there is an excess of reliance on coal. BD: It's not a question of being defensive, it's a question about the ill-informed, because you want us as a country to be cleaner and not have electricity and energy and that is a problem. CNN: That's not what I'm saying, it's a fact that South Africa relies heavily on coal. BD: It is a fact and successfully have done so. We've said clearly growth is important, we have said clearly that we're committed to a low-carbon future over time, so it is not growth at all costs. South Africa has got a very clear path and strategy and is fully committed to deal with that. South Africa has made very clear commitments in terms of its CO2 emissions. South Africa has also made it very clear that it is a developing country that must grow, that we must see the establishment of funding to make sure that it is available for us to do so. We have a clear path as to how we make sure we grow and how we make sure we respond to the needs of the environment and as a country and as company we're fully committed to that. CNN: Is nuclear still a very big part of your plans? BD: South Africa has produced a 20-year energy electricity plan and that plan has got an inclusion of nuclear. That plan says, of the additional capacity of the next 20 years, 42% of it will be renewables, 23% of it will be nuclear, because we do have requirement for base-load energy. We can't stall electricity -- nuclear as a base-load energy option is a viable option for this continent and again, coming back to my previous point, no one option, whether coal or renewables or hydro will solve our energy problems in the future. We need a combination of all of it, and including nuclear for that matter.","Brian Dames is the CEO of South Africa's power utility company Eskom .

"For more than a month, a U.S. Marine and Afghanistan war veteran has been held in a Tijuana, Mexico, prison, fighting for his release after being charged with a crime he says he did not commit. Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi said he accidentally crossed into Mexico around 10 p.m. on March 31 with three personal firearms while on his way to meet friends in San Ysidro, California. Tahmooressi, 25, had recently moved to the area to get treatment for his post-traumatic stress disorder and was ""essentially living out of his truck,"" his mother, Jill, told CNN. He is currently being held in the La Mesa penitentiary in Tijuana on a weapons charge and awaits a May 28 court date, according to the Mexican attorney general's office.

Last week, Hunter wrote a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry, urging him to get involved. Also, in a bipartisan congressional letter addressed to Mexico's attorney general on May 8, Hunter wrote: . ""Mexico's Attorney General is in a position to deal with Andrew's case and ensure its quick resolution ... it is necessary that the AG intervene and expedite proceedings at the very least.  And so far there's been no validation from Mexico that Andrew didn't make a directional mistake at the border."" The Mexican attorney general's office confirmed Tahmooressi's arrest on a weapons charge but could not offer more details about his case. ""Mother's Day is Sunday. If I can have my baby home on Sunday, that would be the greatest gift a mother could ever ask for,"" Jill Tahmooressi said in an interview from Miami. ""The brutality of being ... unjustly in a foreign prison is worse than any experience I had with him serving two tours in Afghanistan,"" she said. ""He was willing to die for his country as a Marine. Where is his country now when he needs it the most?"" It is difficult for the U.S. State Department to quantify how many arrests are due to accidental crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border, a spokeswoman told CNN, but Andrew Tahmooressi's case is not all that unique. In 2012, former Marine Jon Hammar was on his way to a surfing trip with friends when he was arrested while carrying an antique shotgun across the Mexican border checkpoint in Brownsville, Texas. His mother told CNN that her son was arrested and held for more than three months even though he had registered his weapon with U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents before his trip. ""The press coverage led to his release,"" Olivia Hammar said in a phone interview. ""It's an illegitimate (court) process (in Mexico). There's no oral arguments. You're guilty until you're proven innocent. Unfortunately, the only way to deal with that is ... if the (U.S.) State Department is not going to do something about it, then you have to go to the public and force them to do something about it. In our case, that's what moved things along."" In a daily press briefing this week, CNN asked State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki about Tahmooressi's case, but she declined to comment, citing ""privacy concerns."" Meanwhile, Tahmooressi's family is determined to secure his release. In the weeks since his arrest, they have held rallies across the United States, done media interviews and promoted a whitehouse.gov petition to draw attention to his imprisonment. ""The affect (sic) of this unjust incarceration on a decorated combat Marine is despairing,"" the petition said. As of Thursday evening, it had garnered nearly 12,500 signatures, about 87,500 short of the 100,000 required to get a response from the White House.","Sgt.

"A purebred yellow Labrador retriever, Oakley likes to run, swim and get into most everything -- ""whether it's trouble or not,"" his owner 1st Lt. Brandon Harker affectionately says. And as much as anything, Oakley enjoys cuddling wherever, with whomever. That's just what Harker wanted to do with him this month, when he got back from a 9-month deployment to Afghanistan. Except Oakley was gone. The friend with whom Harker had left Oakley said he'd gotten rid of the dog. ""I'd just like to get him back, safe and sound,"" Harker said Friday night. ""That's about it."" About a year after joining the Army, Harker got the playful lab over Memorial Day weekend in 2011, while he was at Fort Benning in western Georgia. Describing him sweetly as ""a very big baby,"" Harker said Oakley loved to snuggle. ""It doesn't matter who it was, he'd try to crawl up on your lap."" Whenever Harker was in the United States, Oakley would go with him. And whenever he deployed, his beloved dog would be left with a friend. That's what happened last year, when the lieutenant left Oakley with someone he described as a ""good friend"" before he headed off to Afghanistan. ""Every time, while I was gone, I asked about him,"" Harker said, recalling how his friend would insist Oakley was ""doing good (and) acting like his regular self. ""I'd ask for a picture every now and then. But I never got any pictures sent to me."" Harker learned the truth as he was flying back to Joint Base Lewis-McCord in Washington. ""What do you mean you got rid of my dog?"" he told his friend. In the few days since coming back, Harker has been on a mission. He posted a plea to find Oakley on Craigslist, noting that he didn't know if the dog had been sold or given away -- something he'd been told happened in May, though Harker isn't so sure. That online item describes Oakley as being ""good with kids and other dogs,"" with darker yellow spots on his face and going down his sides and legs.

"(CNN) -- Belarus' president has ordered the halt of Russian natural gas deliveries to Europe via Belarus, his office told CNN Tuesday. The move comes as Russia is decreasing the amount of natural gas it sends to Belarus over what it says are unpaid debts. Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said Russia owes Belarus $260 million for the natural gas it transports through the country, state news reported. ""I have ordered the government to close down the transit of gas via Belarus until Gazprom pays for it. They haven't paid us a penny for this in the past six months. This is a cynical and absurd situation when you owe me $260 million while I owe you $190 million, and you are closing the valve on me, Lukashenko said, according to the Belarus state-run news agency Belta. Lukashenko's announcement came after Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ordered energy giant Gazprom to restrict gas supplies to Belarus because of what he says are unpaid debts. Alexander Medvedev, head of exports for the company, told reporters that Gazprom would protect its customers. ""We have prepared a plan of actions should Belarus violate its transit commitments and encroach on the gas intended for our European customers. We will do everything possible and impossible so that our European clients would not suffer,"" he said. Energy analysts estimate that Russia exports approximately 20 percent of its gas to Europe through Belarus. The other 80 percent transits through Ukraine. Gas from Russia through Belarus amounts to 6.25 percent of Europe's total gas imports. Officials from the European Commission are in close contact with Russian and Belarusian authorities over the dispute and expect ""that the gas flows to the European Union will not be affected,"" spokeswoman Marlene Holzner told reporters Tuesday. On Tuesday Gazprom reduced the amount of gas it sends to Belarus by 30 percent, company CEO Alexei Miller said in televised remarks. The company had already decreased its supply by 15 percent Monday over a $200-million debt Belarus has accumulated this year, he said. Miller has said the cuts will continue daily and be ""proportional to the volume of debt."" ""The letter actually ends with a threat that if the gas deliveries to Belarus are further reduced, they would take actions to take gas out of the transit pipeline system in order to meet the needs of Belarusian domestic consumers,"" Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov said. ""The problem can hardly be resolved in a constructive way when such a tone and threats are being employed."" Russia's official news agency RIA-Novosti reported earlier Tuesday that Belarusian First Deputy Energy Minister Eduard Tovpinets said that Belarus plans to settle its total debt by July 5 and pay for Russian gas supplied in May by Wednesday. Belarus has refused to pay Russian gas rates of $169 per 1,000 cubic meters for the first quarter of the year and $185 for the second quarter, RIA-Novosti reported. The former Soviet republic has instead been paying $150 since Jan. 1, ringing up a large debt in the process. In the past, other countries including Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Romania, Greece and Turkey have complained that their gas supplies have been affected as Russia trimmed output to upstream customers like Belarus and Ukraine. Gazprom is the world's biggest producer and exporter of natural gas -- and Russia's most powerful company. It controls 20 percent of the world's natural gas reserves and operates the world's largest gas distribution network covering an area from Europe to the Far East, according to its website. Gazprom exports energy to 32 countries and provides around 25 percent of the European Union's gas supplies. Formed in 1989 to replace the Soviet Ministry of the Gas Industry, Gazprom is closely tied to the Russian government, which owns a controlling 50 percent stake in the company. President Dmitry Medvedev is a former Gazprom chairman. In recent years, an increasingly confident Moscow has used Gazprom to assert its authority over Russia's former sphere of influence by offering heavily subsidized gas to ex-Soviet countries. But that policy has led to disputes as Gazprom has then sought to raise prices. Gazprom has switched off gas supplies to another former republic -- Ukraine -- several times in recent years in a row over payments and Kiev's rejection of proposals to hike rates. Those disputes ended earlier this year when Russia agreed to a 30 percent drop in the price of natural gas sold to Ukraine, in exchange for permission to extend Russia's lease of a major naval base in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol, Ukraine, for 25 years. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko and Matthew Chance contributed to this report.","Belarus' president says Russian natural gas deliveries to Europe to be stopped .

"As football's top event kicks off in Brazil, Anthony Pereira dispels some of the myths surrounding the 2014 World Cup's host country -- and its approach to the game it is showcasing. MYTH: Many Brazilians are in the mood to party . REALITY: Many thought that the awarding of the finals -- and the 2016 Olympics in Rio -- would be a ""coming out"" party for Brazil, confirming its new status as a global player. But that is not the atmosphere which seems to be taking hold. For the last year there have been protests over the spiraling costs of the tournament (around $11.5 billion) and government priorities. Many Brazilians have demanded ""FIFA standard"" hospitals, schools, and public transportation, not just stadiums. In 1950, the last time Brazil hosted a World Cup, Brazilians seemed to conform more readily to the stereotype of festive, soccer-mad nationalists (still to be found in some international media). Brazil in 1950 was a largely agrarian country, aspiring to national development and global influence but without the wealth and stature it has today. Back then, most Brazilians' anxieties seem to have been about football. The country was ready to crown its national team, the Seleção, as world champions. Brazil's loss to Uruguay in the final in the newly built Maracanã stadium (then the largest in the world) was seen as a disaster by many, and a confirmation of what the playwright and football commentator Nelson Rodrigues described as Brazilians' ""mongrel complex"" (complexo de vira-lata) or sense of inferiority. Now you've got an 85% urban country with high rates of literacy, growing wealth and universal primary school enrollment. So this is a country that's really been transformed over the last six decades. Young people, in particular, seem untroubled by an inferiority complex and are globally aware. They are not afraid to take to the streets to complain. MYTH: Brazilians are naturally good at football . REALITY: Many people are taken aback by the fact that Brazil has the unique claim of having won the World Cup five times, and participated in all the finals. You could offer an essentialist explanation: ""well, it's because of the mixture of races, because Brazilians like music, the culture of street football and because they're so passionate. It means they're just naturally so tricky and skilful."" The more plausible explanation is that the state invested heavily in football as a means of gaining prestige and asserting identity. So it's a state project which has borne fruit. The epitome of the state's exploitation of Brazilian football expertise was the repressive dictatorship's propaganda attempts to associate itself with the success of the Brazilian team in the 1970 World Cup finals. I think when some people protest now, they are maybe (unconsciously) associating this Cup with that authoritarian project -- and rejecting it. MYTH: The stadiums will be packed across the country . REALITY: There are 12 cities taking part. One of these, Amazonas state capital Manaus is about 4,500 miles from Rio. FIFA itself did not require that so many cities be involved but the Brazilian government was conscious it should not be held in a few selected cities. Instead it should be shared regionally. That's characteristic of Brazilian political style. But it has meant huge stadia have been constructed in some places that probably will not fill them often, including Cuibá, Mato Grosso. These stadia could look like crumbling white elephants in a few years, leaving a negative legacy in some cities and a growing indignation. MYTH: A World Cup win equates to ballot box success . REALITY: The presidential election between the incumbent President Dilma Rousseff of the Workers' Party (PT) and her two main opponents, Aécio Neves of the Social Democratic Party (PSDB) and Eduardo Campos of the Socialist Party (PSB) will kick into full gear after the final on July 13. President Rousseff would like a successful, well-organized Cup to bolster her re-election chances, although she probably does not need the Brazilian team to do well in order to win. Candidates Neves and Campos could benefit from a perception that the Cup did not go well, but they probably will not be able to make too much of this in the campaign, as they both helped to organize it in their home states. MYTH: Brazil has fallen out of love with football . REALITY: In 2014, Brazil's passion for football is still evident. Brazilians have purchased the majority of the 2.5 million tickets despite high prices. Some local protests will likely happen but probably not on the scale of last year. People are wary of being seen as disloyally ""anti-World Cup"" and the government is alert to respond to any disruption. With international attention, there is too much at stake. In 1968, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II visited Brazil where she watched a match at the Maracanã stadium and met Pelé. Then-British Ambassador John Russell noted its importance as ""football is the soul of Brazil."" But is it? Perhaps, but that soul shares football with other passions, including desire for more democracy and less corruption. It could be said that protests have added to pressure on FIFA leading to the current questioning of the Qatari bid for the 2022 World Cup, and investigation. In this sense Brazilians are playing an important role in world football, not simply in their traditional role as brilliant players and passionate fans, but as protesters against and reformers of what many allege is a corrupt institution of global governance.","Many thought awarding of finals would be a ""coming out"" party for Brazil, writes Anthony Pereira .
But that is not the atmosphere which seems to be taking hold, he writes .
Brazil in 1950 was without the wealth and stature it has today .

"Sometimes a story comes along that is so utterly ridiculous that, as a commentator, your first instinct is to deal with it tongue-in-cheek. And so it is with Mitt Romney's videotaped remarks to a roomful of donors at a fundraiser in May in Boca Raton, Florida. The GOP presidential candidate appears to say that he wishes he were Latino because he thinks it would be ""helpful"" to his quest and give him a ""better shot"" at the presidency. Referring to his father, George, Romney told the audience: . ""My dad, as you probably know, was the governor of Michigan and was the head of a car company. But he was born in Mexico ... and had he been born of Mexican parents, I'd have a better shot at winning this. But he was unfortunately born to Americans living in Mexico. He lived there for a number of years. I mean, I say that jokingly, but it would be helpful to be Latino."" I'm tempted to respond with this: ""Mitt Romney thinks it would be helpful if he were Latino. Well, Mitt, I'm Latino. And I think it would be helpful to me if I were worth $250 million. Wanna switch?"" Opinion: Can Romney connect with Latino voters? Or, given President Barack Obama's heavy-handed immigration policies, with this: ""What Mitt Romney doesn't realize is that if he were Mexican, there's a 94.6% chance that he would've already been deported by his opponent."" Romney's comments are clearly absurd, and so it's hard to take them seriously. Did the rich white guy really claim to want to be Latino because he thought it would help him win the presidency? That's strange. Being Latino didn't seem to help Bill Richardson. The former New Mexico governor ran for president in 2008, and he didn't get beyond the New Hampshire primary. Also, by Romney's logic, you would think that we've had a whole slew of Latinos elected president; there hasn't been a single one -- if you don't count Jimmy Smits playing President-elect Matt Santos on the final season of ""The West Wing."" Romney should quit while he's ahead. Statistically, he has the golden ticket. He's a rich white male, and they're overrepresented in the exclusive club of the 44 individuals to ever serve as president. Barack Obama is an exception, and even he satisfies two of three characteristics: rich and male. But, if Mitt really wants to get in touch with his inner Mexican, I think he'll find that it's not all churros and chocolate or pinatas and pan dulce. You see -- and you might find this hard to believe, Mitt -- but there is still a lot of discrimination in this country against Latinos as whites hunker down and try to hold on to what they have in the face of changing demographics. For instance, Romney has two Harvard degrees, and so do I. But I'll go out on a limb here and guess that he never had anyone suggest that he was only admitted to that prestigious university because of affirmative action. Or that he is frequently told, as I am, to ""go back to Mexico"" -- which is ironic, given that, since I'm the grandson of a Mexican immigrant and Romney is the son of a Mexican immigrant, the GOP presidential candidate is one generation closer to the motherland than I am. Yet, as difficult as it is, we must take Romney's comments seriously. There are three reasons that they're troubling. First, judging from the videotape, when Romney suggested that his path to the White House would have been covered in rose petals if only he had been born Mexican, the crowd loved it. What are they thinking? Are these the kind of people who tell themselves that their sons and daughters would have gotten into Yale or Princeton if some black kid hadn't taken their spot? Do they really believe that racial and ethnic minorities have it easy in this country? And if so, what country are they living in? Politics: Romney makes case to Latinos, vows 'reasonable solution' on immigration . Second, if you look at the rest of Romney's remarks -- about the 47% of Americans who pay no taxes and ""who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it"" -- he makes a good point. Many Americans do have an entitlement mentality, and it's a real problem. Where Romney went wrong is that the sense of entitlement isn't limited to those on government aid. It includes the kind of fat cat donors who were in the audience. They get tax breaks and corporate subsidies. They raise their kids to think they're entitled to not do the jobs that immigrants wind up doing. Romney scolded those who think they're entitled, and then he seemed to wink at the audience and tell them: ""present company excluded."" Lastly, it's hard to come up with a better example of an American who sees himself as a victim with a sense of entitlement than Mitt Romney. Think about what he said. This was no joke. Romney sounds frustrated. By suggesting that he'd have a better chance at winning this election if he were Latino, Romney is playing the victim. Poor me, I had the misfortune to be born a white male. It's clear that he thinks he was entitled to a much smoother path to the White House. Is Romney able to fix what's broken with America? Or are people like Mitt Romney what's broken with America?

"Testifying before Congress on Wednesday, Gen. Keith Alexander, director of the National Security Agency, asserted that his agency's massive acquisition of U.S. phone data and the contents of overseas Internet traffic that is provided by American tech companies has helped prevent ""dozens of terrorist events."" On Thursday, Sens. Ron Wyden and Mark Udall, Democrats who both serve on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and have access to the nation's most sensitive secrets, released a statement contradicting this assertion. ""Gen. Alexander's testimony yesterday suggested that the NSA's bulk phone records collection program helped thwart 'dozens' of terrorist attacks, but all of the plots that he mentioned appear to have been identified using other collection methods,"" the two senators said. Indeed, a survey of court documents and media accounts of all the jihadist terrorist plots in the United States since 9/11 by the New America Foundation shows that traditional law enforcement methods have overwhelmingly played the most significant role in foiling terrorist attacks. This suggests that the NSA surveillance programs are wide-ranging fishing expeditions with little to show for them. Alexander promised during his congressional testimony that during this coming week more information would be forthcoming about how the NSA surveillance programs have prevented many attacks. A U.S. intelligence document provided to CNN by a congressional source over the weekend asserts that the dragnet of U.S. phone data and Internet information from overseas users ""has contributed to the disruption of dozens of potential terrorist plots here in the homeland and in more than 20 countries around the world."" The public record, which is quite rich when it comes to jihadist terrorism cases, suggests that the NSA surveillance yielded little of major value to prevent numerous attacks in the United States, but government officials may be able to point to a number of attacks that were averted overseas. That may not do much to dampen down the political firestorm that has gathered around the NSA surveillance programs. After all, these have been justified because they have supposedly helped to keep Americans safe at home. Homegrown jihadist extremists have mounted 42 plots to conduct attacks within the United States since 2001. Of those plots, nine involved an actual terrorist act that was not prevented by any type of government action, such as the failed attempt by Faisal Shahzad to blow up a car bomb in Times Square on May 1, 2010. Of the remaining 33 plots, the public record shows that at least 29 were uncovered by traditional law enforcement methods, such as the use of informants, reliance on community tips about suspicious activity and other standard policing practices. Informants have played a critical role in preventing more than half of the plots by homegrown jihadist extremists since the 9/11 attacks, according to New America Foundation data. For instance, a group of Muslims from the Balkans living in southern New Jersey who were virulently opposed to the Iraq War told a government informant in 2007 they were plotting to kill soldiers stationed at the nearby Fort Dix army base. Other investigations have relied on tips to law enforcement. Saudi student Khalid Aldawsari's plot to attack a variety of targets in Texas in 2011, including President George W. Bush's home in Dallas, was foiled when a company reported his attempt to buy chemicals suitable for making explosives. Standard police work has also stopped plots. Kevin Lamar James, a convert to Islam, formed a group dedicated to holy war while he was jailed in California's Folsom Prison during the late 1990s. James' crew planned to attack a U.S. military recruiting station in Los Angeles on the fourth anniversary of 9/11 as well as a synagogue a month later. Members of James' group financed their activities by sticking up gas stations, and their plans only came to light during the course of a routine investigation of a gas station robbery by local police in Torrance, California, who found documents that laid out the group's plans for mayhem. In defending the role of NSA surveillance in his congressional testimony, Alexander pointed to two plots averted by his agency's programs; the plan by Denver resident Najibullah Zazi  to bomb the New York subway system in 2009 and a plot the same year by Chicago resident David Coleman Headley to attack the offices of a Danish newspaper that had printed cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed that many Muslims deemed offensive. In the Zazi case, testimony in a Brooklyn court shows that around the eighth anniversary of 9/11, U.S. officials found an e-mail address in Pakistan, believed to be connected to al Qaeda, that was in communication with njbzaz@yahoo.com, an e-mail address in the Denver area. Officials found that Zazi was e-mailing from njbzaz@yahoo.com to get clarification from his handlers in Pakistan about how to mix ingredients for the bombs he was building in his Denver apartment. Zazi was arrested before he could carry out his plan to attack the New York subways. This plot could well have been detected by the NSA's PRISM program, which collects the e-mails and other records of computer users outside the United States from nine U.S. technology companies, including Yahoo. But the detection of the plot does not appear to have anything to do with the government's collection of the phone records of tens of millions of Americans. In the case of Headley, the government hasn't clarified its claim that NSA surveillance led to his detection, but Sebastian Rotella of ProPublica, who has done the most authoritative reporting on the Headley case, says that Headley came to the attention of U.S. officials because he was in contact with al Qaeda operatives in the United Kingdom who were under surveillance by the British. In other words, Headley was not detected by NSA surveillance but because of a tip from a close ally. Moreover, conventional law enforcement methods were available to detect Headley's ties to terrorism, but they were ignored. Headley's wife warned the FBI of his involvement with the Pakistani-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba years before his plot to attack the Danish newspaper.","National Security Agency chief says NSA has prevented ""dozens of terrorist events""

"(CNN) -- Aaron Paul is still upset that Toys R Us pulled ""Breaking Bad"" action figures from its stores and noted that a petition to keep the figures has gained signers. ""Dear @ToysRUs, We have close to 30,000 signed on the petition, that is 3 times the amount that caused you to remove the toys. Talk to me. Ap,"" he tweeted. Paul played Jesse Pinkman, the assistant to Bryan Cranston's meth-dealing Walter White, on the hit AMC show. The toy store chain decided to pull the action figures thanks in part to an online petition that urged the store to stop selling them at their stores and online. The petition, issued by Susan Schrivjer of Fort Myers, Florida, received more than 9,000 signatures. Using the name Susan Myers on Change.org, Schrivjer noted the store's ""selection of toys for children of all ages."" However, she added, ""their decision to sell a Breaking Bad doll, complete with a detachable sack of cash and a bag of meth, alongside children's toys is a dangerous deviation from their family friendly values.""

"(CNN) -- Small fish, turtles and other amphibians are being sold in Beijing as mobile phone trinkets and key rings, to the chagrin of animal rights groups. Kept in bags filled with colored, oxygenated water the animals cost around $1.50 each. One vendor selling the animals outside of a Beijing subway station told CNN that the bag contained crystallized oxygen and nutrients. She said that that the animals could live for days but also warned that they should be freed from the bag as soon as the air ran out or they would suffocate. Among the animals being sold are young Chinese soft-shell turtles - the adult turtles are a popular dish in Chinese cooking. The live trinkets have been condemned by animal rights groups who have highlighted the lack of animal protection laws in China. ""Lack of food and diminishing oxygen concentrations within both the water and the small amount of air in these plastic pouches will cause the animals to die in a relatively short period of time after the pouches are sealed,"" said David Neale, animal welfare director of Animals Asia. ""If a national animal protection law was enacted in China, such acts of cruelty could be prevented, and those who persist in causing harm and suffering to animals within their care could be prosecuted."" Neale also warned that keeping a turtle in a bag and then as a pet could have health implications for people. ""Individuals should also be aware of the potential human health risks associated with being in close contact with animals such as turtles. Turtles frequently carry salmonella bacteria that can cause serious illness,"" he said.","Turtles sold as live key rings by Beijing street vendors .

In 2014, the movement to publish more authors of color and write multicultural main characters remains slow and incremental. This is not a new discussion: There has long been criticism about the lack of diversity in young adult literature, books written for readers ages 12 to 18. Experts and authors like Walter Dean Myers point back as early as 1965, when educator Nancy Larrick stirred the conversation with an article entitled ""The All-White World of Children's Books."" Myers recently wrote about the topic in The New York Times: . ""As I discovered who I was, a black teenager in a white-dominated world, I saw that these characters, these lives, were not mine,"" he wrote. ""What I wanted, needed really, was to become an integral and valued part of the mosaic that I saw around me."" Even though young adult literature is enjoying a golden age and authors are working to diversify their stories, lead characters of color or characters who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender are still slow to appear in popular mainstream young adult fiction. Without these characters, the landscape of young adult literature isn't reflective of our society, author Sherman Alexie said. He's one of many authors, teachers, librarians, publishers and editors have ideas of how to transform this persistent negative with positive changes. Reaching more readers . Cindy Pon and Malinda Lo discovered each other when they published their Chinese young adult fantasy stories. What began as a book tour grew into a website, Diversity in YA, where they emphasize that books featuring diverse characters are for everyone -- not just people who relate directly to the characters. ""Readers look at our books and if they aren't into Asian culture, they think it's not for them,"" author Cindy Pon said, ""Our books are for everyone. It's not just about identity."" After realizing his other books spoke strongly to the Mexican-American identity angle, de la Peña decided to write a story with more mass appeal, ""The Living."" He's currently writing a sequel. ""There is an evolution within our own work,"" he said. ""When you are writing with race as one of the elements of the story, early on, you write about race. As you do more work, the race becomes part of the story and not the story. I think that will be the biggest boost for multicultural literature. ""But on the flip side, I get worried about people who just make the character black on the outside, but not on the inside."" Facing down challenges . Sherman Alexie's book ""The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian"" is a National Book Award winner that was hailed as one of the best reads for young people in 2007. It's also one of the books most often challenged or banned in schools and libraries. With young adult fiction, ""you can make real significant social change,"" Alexie said. ""There is a political, social meaning and everything I believe about the way the world should be has been reflected in the way that my book has been treated, appealed to and offended people."" Currently, there are more than 500 federally recognized tribes of Native Americans in America, according to the National Congress of American Indians. But in young adult fiction, they are often misrepresented as romanticized ""mystical Indians"" and they don't reflect the experience of Native kids growing up on the reservation, said Debbie Reese, founder of American Indians in Children's Literature. Authors such as Alexie, Eric Gansworth, Cynthia Leitich Smith and Debby Dahl Edwardson are working to fight stereotypes that American Indians can only be present in ""buckskin and beads"" by writing the real experience the Native American teens have on the reservation. ""I'm not this tragic figure from the past,"" said Gansworth, author of ""If I Ever Get Out of Here."" Sites such as Diversity in YA encourage all writers to diversify their book characters; after all, not every book including multicultural characters comes from an author of color. But for any writer deviating from his or her own experience, it requires extensive research and cultural immersion to avoid stereotypes or misconceptions. Still, some authors feel that the publishing industry is reluctant to take risks by marketing books that don't mimic previous successes. Cheryl Klein, executive editor of Arthur A. Levine Books, said publishers don't see ""enormous numbers"" of books from writers of color, and publishers turn down 97% of manuscripts they receive, regardless of the topic. Klein, co-founder of the Children's Book Council Diversity Committee -- a group of editors passionate about publishing books that reach and reflect the demographics of their readers -- said there's room for improvement. ""We want to keep hearing more and more voices,"" she said. ""It's important to have advocates at every stage, from editing to marketing, from librarians to authors, so it's an industry-wide effort."" Changing the publishers . Authors like Alexie and Walter Dean Myers see the growth of small press publishers of color as one way to expand multicultural representation in young adult fiction. ""We see it time and time again: Innovation comes from the small press world,"" Alexie said. At the National Council of Teachers of English convention in late 2013, Myers spoke about his dream of subsidizing publishers. His vision? Teaming up with a university press to host a yearly contest for people of color who write young adult fiction. A brief history of young adult literature . The exposure to editors and publishers would benefit talented writers who otherwise have a difficult time being seen. ""Hypothetically, here are five finalists who would be exposed to all aspects of the publishing community whose voices might never be heard otherwise,"" Myers said. It could be the beginning of real change in young adult fiction. ""Looking at these kids when I'm speaking, I think, 'This is the generation,' "" de la Peña said. ""They are going to write what they want and feature themselves."" What young adult books did you relate to as a teen?

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Workers at Japan's crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant faced a difficult balancing act Tuesday as they struggled to keep reactors cool and prevent radioactive water from leaking into the ocean. Water has been a key weapon in the battle to stave off a meltdown at the facility since a March 11 earthquake and tsunami knocked out cooling systems. But tons of water have been pumped and sprayed to keep the plant's radioactive fuel from overheating, and the plant is running out of room to store the now-contaminated liquid. ""Now the focus is how to ... remove the water and contain it safely,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano, the government's point man for the crisis, told reporters Tuesday. The discovery of contaminated water in a maintenance tunnel that leads to the No. 2 reactor's turbine plant has sparked fresh concerns about the possibility of additional radiation leaking from the plant. Japan's nuclear safety agency said workers were using sandbags and concrete panels to keep the water inside the tunnel, which is located about 55 meters (180 feet) from the Pacific shore. Workers are also trying to pump water out of the turbine houses of the No. 1 and No. 3 reactors, according to the Tokyo Electric Power Company, the plant's owner. Lights were restored in the main control room of the No. 4 reactor, the utility said. The company also reported that freshwater was being injected into the No. 3 reactor. Seawater was previously used. ""TEPCO is in an awful dilemma right now,"" said Jim Walsh, an international security expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""One the one hand, they want to cool the reactor and keep the reactor cool, so they have to pour water in. If there is a leak in one of the containment vessels, that water keeps leaking out. So they have a problem where the more they try to cool it down, the greater the radiation hazard as that water leaks out from the plant."" Japanese officials and international experts have said they believe there's been a partial meltdown at three of the plant's six reactors, and Edano reported Monday that the No. 2 reactor's containment vessel may be leaking. ""The high radiation levels on site seem to support that idea. There is no visual proof yet, but it's increasingly likely there was partial fuel melting,"" said Gary Was, a nuclear engineering expert at the University of Michigan. The discovery of plutonium, a nuclear fission byproduct as well as a component of the fuel in the No. 3 reactor, among the contaminants on the plant grounds bolsters the suspicion of a meltdown, Walsh said. Though low levels of plutonium can be found worldwide -- a legacy of previous decades of aboveground nuclear tests -- at least some of the contamination likely came from the plant, Edano said Tuesday. ""If we detect higher levels of plutonium, we have to take additional measures, so our intention for now is to carry on with the monitoring on-site,"" he said. The element can be a serious health hazard if inhaled or ingested, but external exposure poses little health risk, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Experts told a U.S. Senate hearing Tuesday they are not sure how soon the reactors and spent fuel can be safely inspected. Japanese officials have been given information on radiation-hardened robots that are being made available to make such observations, said Peter Lyons, acting assistant secretary for nuclear energy in the U.S. Energy Department. The now 19-day-old crisis at the plant has spread radioactive contamination across much of northern Japan. But Tokyo Electric said the discovery of plutonium would not change efforts to bring an end to the disaster, an aftereffect of the magnitude-9 earthquake that struck the region March 11. The water found in the Unit 2 maintenance tunnel remained radioactive enough to pose an immediate hazard, authorities reported Monday afternoon. The 1,000-millisievert per hour reading was more than 330 times the dose an average person in a developed country receives per year and can result in vomiting and up to a 30% higher risk of cancer, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. The level is also four times the top dose Japan's Health Ministry has set for emergency workers. Radioactive iodine and cesium, also reactor byproducts, have turned up in the sea near the plant. But the levels reported by the utility on Tuesday were down sharply from those seen over the weekend. Tuesday's tests found levels of iodine-131, an isotope that loses half its radioactivity within eight days, at 816 times normal levels within about 100 feet of the plant. That's down from a high of 1,850 times normal reported Sunday at another nearby monitoring post. Authorities have said they don't think the seawater contamination is coming directly from the plant, but could be caused by particles carried by runoff or that have fallen from the atmosphere. Meanwhile, Edano told reporters Tuesday that officials hope to find workers to relieve those at the plant, who have been scrambling for nearly three weeks to keep the reactors under control. ""On the ground at the nuclear power plant, the workers are working under very dangerous and very hard conditions, and I feel a great deal of respect for them,"" he said. As workers inside brave high radiation, the situation has also taken a significant toll beyond the complex's six reactors. Authorities have banned sale and transport of some vegetables grown in the area after tests detected radiation. Signs of contaminated tap water prompted officials to tell residents in some areas to stop giving it to infants. And the government has said residents within a 20-kilometer (12-mile) radius of the plant must evacuate. The growing damages could have a steep price tag for the embattled Tokyo Electric, as farmers and others impacted by the disaster ask for compensation. Some have questioned whether Japan's government will step in, and one government minister told reporters Tuesday that nationalizing the company could be an option. ""Of course, a debate on various options should be possible,"" Japanese National Strategy Minister Koichiro Genba told reporters when asked whether the government was considering at least partially nationalizing the company. Another topic Japanese officials are already beginning to debate is the country's energy policy -- and particularly its reliance on nuclear power. Edano said the government will continue to ""strongly promote"" clean energy, but fixing problems at the troubled Fukushima nuclear plant and reviewing the safety of the nation's other plants take precedence. Yoshiaki Oka, a nuclear engineering professor at Tokyo's Waseda University, told CNN that he remained optimistic that the threat at Fukushima Daiichi would be contained soon.  He said Japan's lack of other resources such as oil or coal made nuclear power a necessity. ""Already, dependence on oil in Japan is very high,"" he said. Japan imports nearly 80% of its oil, a fact Oka called ""very bad for national security."" ""From these considerations, maybe some countrypeople will understand the other option of power generation, nuclear power, can play a role,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A Boston, Massachusetts, police officer who sent a mass e-mail in which he referred to Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. as ""banana-eating"" and a ""bumbling jungle monkey"" has been placed on administrative leave and faces losing his job. Officer Justin Barrett, 36, who is also an active member of the National Guard, sent an e-mail to some fellow Guard members, as well as the Boston Globe, in which he vented his displeasure with a July 22 Globe column about Gates' controversial arrest. The columnist, Yvonne Abraham, supported Gates' actions, asking readers, ""Would you stand for this kind of treatment, in your own home, by a police officer who by now clearly has no right to be there?"" In his e-mail, which was posted on a local Boston television station's Web site, Barrett declared that if he had ""been the officer he verbally assaulted like a banana-eating jungle monkey, I would have sprayed him in the face with OC [oleoresin capsicum, or pepper spray] deserving of his belligerent noncompliance."" Barrett used the ""jungle monkey"" phrase four times, three times referring to Gates and once referring to Abraham's writing as ""jungle monkey gibberish."" He also declared he was ""not a racist but I am prejudice [sic] towards people who are stupid and pretend to stand up and preach for something they say is freedom but it is merely attention because you do not get enough of it in your little fear-dwelling circle of on-the-bandwagon followers."" According to a statement from Boston police, Commissioner Edward Davis took action immediately upon learning of Barrett's remarks, stripping the officer of his gun and badge. Barrett is ""on administrative leave pending the outcome of a termination hearing."" CNN has been unable to reach Barrett for comment. Davis wants Barrett, a two-year veteran of the Boston police force, fired, a source close to the investigation said. But Barrett will continue to be paid while on administrative leave, and no date has been set for his termination hearing. Barrett, who identified himself as a veteran and a former English teacher, also took issue with Abraham's journalistic ability, calling her ""a hot little bird with minimal experience in a harsh field,"" as well as ""an infidel."" The rambling e-mail also suggested that she ""should serve me coffee and donuts on Sunday morning,"" later returning to that line of thought with, ""I like a warm cruller and hot Panamanian, black. No sugar."" The Boston Police Patrolmen's Association was also quick to condemn the comments, describing them as ""offensive and hurtful."" The organization sought to assure citizens that ""these statements are not representative of the ideals held by the dedicated police officers who make up this proud association.""","Boston police officer sends mass e-mail protesting column on Henry Gates .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Department of Homeland Security has more contractors working for it than full-time employees, a situation two members of Congress said Tuesday was ""unacceptable, untenable and unsustainable."" Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and ranking Republican Susan Collins said they were ""astounded"" to learn there are more than 200,000 contractor employees at the department. The civilian work force of Homeland Security numbers 188,000, according to an estimate provided to the senators by Homeland Security. In a letter sent Tuesday to the agency's Secretary Janet Napolitano, Lieberman and Collins said the figure ""raises the question of whether DHS itself is in charge of its programs and policies, or whether it inappropriately has ceded core decisions to contractors."" Although Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, and Collins of Maine noted that contractors can offer a variety of needed assets and skills to federal agencies, they called the current balance between federal employees and contractors at Homeland Security ""unacceptable, untenable and unsustainable,"" according to the letter. Napolitano is slated to appear before the Senate committee Wednesday and is expected to face questions on the subject. The senators want a unit-by-unit breakdown of where in Homeland Security the contractors are working and have asked for assurances that contractors are not performing ""inherently governmental work."" Clark Stevens, a spokesman for Homeland Security, told CNN Tuesday that ""Secretary Napolitano has been strongly committed to decreasing the department's reliance on contractors and strengthening the federal work force"" at Homeland Security. ""Over the past year, we have been actively converting contractor positions to government positions and will continue to build on these efforts at an even more aggressive pace this year. We are working across the department to identify and make additional conversions as quickly as possible while sustaining the work force required to carry out our critical mission,"" Stevens said.","Sens.

"When Ashley Blackmon sat down for her job interview for a marketing position in New York City, she didn't start off by talking about the business classes she had taken in college or her experience working at a financial services company. Instead, she talked about the five months she spent studying and traveling in Spain. ""When I left the interview, I felt amazing,"" said Blackmon, 24, who studied at ESEI International Business School in Barcelona the year before she graduated Clark Atlanta University. She landed that marketing analyst job at a large food and beverage company and believes her study-abroad experience was the thing that set her apart. ""I learned how to be a better businesswoman, critical thinker and relationship builder in a new culture,"" she said. Studying abroad isn't a common experience for most U.S. college students. In fact, only 1% of students manage to study abroad. Finances, time constraints and safety are some of the challenges U.S. students face when deciding to spend a semester or two overseas. But globetrotting during or after college could give recent graduates an edge in the job market, which continues to be one of the toughest on record for 20-somethings. The potential benefits are prompting new study-abroad initiatives in the States. Organizations such as the Institute of International Education have launched programs such as Generation Study Abroad in hopes of doubling the number of U.S. students who travel internationally. An international push from the White House . First lady Michelle Obama is also working on efforts to promote more international travel among Americans. She's in China with her daughters and mother, speaking about the importance of education, youth empowerment and the benefits of studying abroad. The first lady conducted an exclusive interview with CNN iReporters on Saturday, taking their questions on studying abroad. ""The benefits of studying abroad are almost endless,"" Obama said during the CNN iReport interview. ""First of all, it is going to make you more marketable in the United States. More and more companies are realizing that they need people with experience around the world."" Howard Wallack, vice president of global business development at the Society for Human Resource Management, has experience as a hiring manager and was an international exchange student. He says traveling abroad can introduce students to a host of skills. ""Living in another country, you learn to deal with a variety of people,"" he said. ""You learn to listen, be proactive, be patient, assertive. All those are translatable skills."" Wallack's experience working in a rural health clinic in Guatemala after a major earthquake helped him find compassion and resiliency within himself. ""If you just stay in your own country, you have a certain mindset about your own culture. When you step out of that, you challenge your experiences and find out about yourself, which can translate in the workplace,"" he said. The problem is students don't always know how to illustrate those experiences on paper. But some colleges are taking steps to teach soon-to-be graduates how to leverage their study abroad adventures for job interviews. Take the trip, land the job . Heather White is the director of the Career Resource Center at the University of Florida. With an enrollment of 50,000 students annually, she says the key to standing out with your travel experience is to be strategic about how you exhibit it. ""Some students tend to write on their resume, 'study abroad France,' and that is it. We recommend expanding on that experience. Did they volunteer, work, study?"" she said. Jennifer Grasz, a spokesperson for job-posting site CareerBuilder, says to write out what you learned and how it's relevant to your professional performance on your resume. ""For example: Traveling abroad has provided me with a greater knowledge and appreciation of global communities and how to effectively navigate around communication and cultural barriers,"" she wrote in an e-mail to CNN. Ashley Putnam, a fellowship director and writer for Idealist, an online resource for finding nonprofit jobs, is a bit more skeptical about the career benefits of studying overseas. ""It depends on what they did,"" she explained. Running a public policy program, she looks for applicants who are realistic about job expectations. ""I find that people who paid to volunteer abroad sort of just take pictures and hold babies,"" she said. ""It depends on your study abroad program, too. Just having studied abroad is good, but there is a whole other aspect to what you did while you were there."" That's exactly what Alexa Basile tried to keep in mind when she selected her study abroad program. The State University of New York at Potsdam student spent a year in Australia teaching social studies to a class of nine students. It was during that immersion with her students, many of whom had behavioral problems, that she noticed her eighth-grade students were reading at a second-grade level. That inspired her to focus on more critical reading lessons. ""And that made me realize I wanted to be a literacy specialist,"" she said, which she is now emphasizing as she interviews for graduate school. Like Blackmon, Basile puts her study-abroad experience on her resume, but she also goes in depth about her trip in her cover letter. She's candid with interviewers about her successes and challenges overseas. ""I had times with this class that were really tough, and sometimes frustrating,"" she said. Her students routinely challenged her instructions, defied her and talked back to her. ""But my very last day, I walked into the classroom and they decorated it for me and they brought me treats and toys,"" she said. ""I broke down immediately. It really proved to me they were tough, but they appreciated me."" Those frustrating and rewarding moments helped hone her classroom management skills. After Basile came back from Australia, she got her second student teaching job at an inner-city school in New York City. It's exactly that sort of program involvement that Idealist's Putnam says will make hiring managers care about a study abroad trip. ""Be self-aware as you are doing your job and take stock in what skills you are building. It's not just 'I go to a class and I teach the class,' "" she said. ""Be critical of the work that you are doing."" Basile, who is interviewing for graduate schools, says to approach studying abroad with realistic expectations. ""To get most out of your travel, you need to go with the mindset that you are going to do a lot of things and be involved,"" she said. ""Get hands on and look for a program that has those experiences. You can be a tourist on a family vacation.""","First lady Michelle Obama is in China, promoting international travel and cultural exchange .

"The World Health Organization wants you to stop eating so much sugar. Seriously. In draft guidelines proposed this week, WHO is encouraging people to consume less than 5% of their total daily calories from sugars. The organization's current guidelines, published in 2002, recommend eating less than 10% of your total daily calories from sugars. Most Americans still consume much more. Our sweet tooth increased 39% between 1950 and 2000, according to the USDA. The average American now consumes about three pounds of sugar each week. ""There is increasing concern that consumption of free sugars, particularly in the form of sugar-sweetened beverages, may result in ... an increase in total caloric intake, leading to an unhealthy diet, weight gain and increased risk of noncommunicable diseases,"" WHO said in a statement. Of particular concern, WHO said, is the role sugar plays in causing dental diseases worldwide. For an adult at a normal body mass index, or BMI, eating 5% would be around 25 grams of sugar -- or six teaspoons. That's less than is typically found in a single can of regular soda, which contains about 40 grams of sugar. Real or fake sugar: Does it matter? To find the amount of calories from sugar in a product, multiply the grams by 4. For example, a product containing 15 grams of sugar has 60 calories from sugar per serving, according to the American Heart Association. If you eat 2,000 calories a day, that's 3%. WHO's proposed guidelines apply to sugars added to foods by manufacturers, as well as those found naturally in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit concentrates. They do not apply to those found in fresh produce. ""Much of the sugars consumed today are 'hidden' in processed foods that are not usually seen as sweets,"" the WHO website states. Did you know sugar is often added to your frozen pizza? How about your bread, soup, yogurt and mayonnaise? As consumers became more concerned about the amount of fat in their food, manufacturers went out of their way to make low-fat items -- often substituting sugar to preserve the taste. Choosing foods with fewer added sugars at the grocery story may soon get a little easier. The Food and Drug Administration has proposed several changes to the nutrition labels you see on packaged foods and beverages. The proposed labels would also note how much added sugar is in a product. Right now, it's hard to know what is naturally occurring sugar and what has been added by the manufacturer. The WHO guidelines will be open for public comment until March 31. Then WHO will finalize and publish its recommendations.","The World Health Organization proposes new guidelines for sugar consumption .

"Once was a time when getting money out for the weekend meant going down to the bank branch and joining a long queue. Since then ATMs, credit cards and internet banking have taken the place of the payday press at the grille of a bank teller. With all the facilities of a bank now fitting into a palm-sized smartphone, the drudgery of waiting to deposit or withdraw funds has been consigned to the waste paper basket of history. Just a swipe of the finger can now transfer funds between accounts anywhere in the world and even taking a picture can deposit a cheque. Increasingly high street branches -- many of them still occupying some of the most imposing buildings in town -- are becoming expensive white elephants for many banking corporations. One bank, however, is repurposing its more than 300 banks to bring people back to the branch; making its physical space as enticing as the virtual one. ""The branch model is outdated and not relevant any longer we're looking to create a different kind of bank one that offers all the products and services of a large bank but delivers them with real community engagement and the service of a great retailer or hospitality company,"" said Eve Callahan of Oregon-based Umpqua Bank. Using what it calls the store concept, Umpqua Bank aims to create for banking what Apple or Gap has done for computing and apparel -- that is set up a space where customers, or just the curious, can browse, rest or come in and do some banking. Umpqua's store in San Francisco is the latest manifestation of the project. The slick, modern and comfortable space provides information on a touchscreen (what it calls a Catalyst Wall) rather than on the traditional brochures. Customers that want a meeting room can use one of Umpqua's at no cost. Even if all you want is a cup of coffee and some free WiFi, then Umpqua's doors are always open. Ultimately, banking is based on trust and Umpqua has found its local branches a perfect place to build that relationship. ""There's no pressure that you're not a customer with us. We welcome everyone regardless of whether they have a relationship with us or not,"" said Abdul Sanger, Universal Associate, at Umpqua Bank. The model is now being emulated by large banks such as Chase, Citibank and Barclays, all anxious to rebuild the face-to-face relationships that have been lost in the internet age. ""How companies come up with a model that captures a truly integrated customer experience,"" said Callahan. ""I think those companies are the organisations that will really win in the future.""","Bank branches, many of them still occupying imposing buildings, are becoming expensive white elephants .

"On a day marking the 89th anniversary of the founding of Turkey, a country that has marketed itself as a stable, prosperous and democratic role model for the Muslim world, riot police clashed with defiant opposition groups, firing water cannons at a patriotic rally in the capital. Tensions mounted ahead of Monday's Republic Day holiday, when the governor of Ankara banned the planned march organized by secularist opposition groups that are deeply critical of Turkey's Islamist-rooted government. Despite the ban, opposition groups defiantly vowed to go ahead with their rally. They were joined by Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of Turkey's largest opposition party, the Republican People's Party, or CHP. Read more: Press freedom watchdog slams Turkish government . Kilicdaroglu boycotted the government's traditional military parade. Instead, he attended the opposition gathering, just a few minutes' drive away from the parade grounds in Ankara. Turkish television networks split their live coverage of two simultaneous Republic Day celebrations. Turkish President Abdullah Gul and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan sat in grandstands, watching police, schoolchildren and helmeted soldiers in tanks and armored personnel carriers filing past on parade. Meanwhile, CHP leader Kilicdaroglu addressed a crowd of several thousand flag-waving supporters next to a statue of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the Turkish Republic. Sometime after noon Monday, cameras suddenly broadcast live images of riot police firing water cannons at the opposition gathering. CNN Turk showed waterlogged activists brandishing Turkish flags, struggling to stand their ground against multiple water cannons. Activists said police also fired tear gas at the rally. Read more: Turkey boom dampened by Europe's troubles . ""They used gas and they used water,"" said Alper Kafa, an opposition party activist and general director of the Association of Public Conservatory Graduates, speaking on the phone from Ankara with CNN. ""This is the shameful face or our alleged democracy,"" he added. ""On the 89th anniversary of our great leader's foundation of the republic, in the place where he made the declaration, they used gas against the people. It is so very sad."" ""It is shameful to use water cannons and tear gas at crowds which include children and old ladies out there to celebrate the republic,"" said Asli Aydintasbas, a columnist with the Turkish daily newspaper Milliyet. ""It shows to me that people come and go, but the fundamentals of the regime in Ankara do not change."" Since his Justice and Development Party, or AKP, first won parliamentary elections 10 years ago, Prime Minister Erdogan has governed Turkey through an unprecedented decade of economic expansion. Voters have rewarded Erdogan, re-electing his party in national parliamentary and municipal elections. Read more: Eight killed in bombing in Turkey . Erdogan also won a bitter power struggle against the military and Turkey's traditional secular establishment.  Hundreds of generals have been arrested in recent years, accused of plotting to overthrow the government.  Until Erdogan's rise to power, the Turkish military had a stranglehold on Turkish politics, overthrowing at least four civilian governments in the last half-century. But Erdogan has come under growing criticism from human rights and freedom of expression groups for his increasingly authoritarian policies. This month, the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists published a report slamming Turkey, accusing it of being the world's worst jailers of journalists. The Turkish newspaper Taraf also announced it is suing Turkey's national intelligence agency. The revelation emerged after Taraf's editors reportedly found court documents proving they were being wiretapped by the agency, whose main mission is to target foreign spies and terrorism threats. Read more: Turkish government asks Kurdish prisoners to end hunger strike . Meanwhile, Kurdish groups accuse Erdogan's government of arresting more than 7,000 Kurdish activists in recent years. Last week, Turkey's justice minister made a public appeal for more than 600 Kurdish prisoners to end a hunger strike that has spread through prisons across the country over the last month and a half. A long-simmering Kurdish insurgency continues to claim lives in the predominantly Kurdish southeastern part of the country. Turkey's semiofficial Anatolia news agency reported that at least one police officer was killed by fighters from the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, in southeastern Turkey on Saturday. Critics said Monday's Republic Day crackdown on the opposition would only further tarnish Erdogan's democratic credentials. ""It is also a disgrace for Turkey to publicly applaud the Arab Spring,"" columnist Aydintasbas said, ""and at home to ban even a small innocent rally. ... To think that any rally is essentially a hidden effort to overthrow the government, which is the paranoia in Ankara right now, points to an autocratic mindset.""","Despite ban, secularists critical of Turkey's Islamist-rooted government protest in Ankara .

"Just like any other night in the NBA, the starting lineups of the Boston Celtics and visiting Golden State Warriors were introduced over the public address system. But Wednesday wasn't just any night at Boston's TD Garden. And the loudest ovations were not for members of either team. Louis ""Louie"" Corbett, 12, who is rapidly losing his eyesight due to retinitis pigmentosa, was in the house to fulfill his final seeing wish: watch his beloved Boston Celtics play a game. ""Welcome Louis!"" flashed on all four sides of the Jumbotron to thunderous applause. ""I'm quite excited to be here for the game,"" Louie told CNN affiliate WCVB. While the reason for his long journey from Auckland, New Zealand, was distressing, the circumstances that brought two communities on opposite sides of the planet together were extraordinary. Louie's progressive disorder will eventually deteriorate his vision. Faced with the grim reality that he will soon lose the ability to see the world around him, his parents wanted to give their youngest of five children an international sightseeing tour. ""This year we're going to try and fill his world with as many beautiful images as we can,"" his mother, Catherine Corbett, told CNN. Louie was instructed to make something of an ocular bucket list -- things and places he'd like to see for the first, only and likely last time. He picked places such as the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, the Empire State Building and, in a sign of the times, Google headquarters in California. But the thing he wanted to experience the most wasn't a landmark or a national park. An avid sports fan, Louie wanted to take in a game. And not just any game -- the Boston Celtics. ""For some reason, he really got hooked on American basketball,"" his mom said. ""He cares about nothing else. He is really quite passionate about it."" Making the list was the easy part. Getting there, however, would be trickier. With Louie's eyesight rapidly fading -- by 50% in the past year alone -- the trip was going to have to be soon. Like, matter-of-weeks soon. Warren Casey, the CEO of a Boston-based software firm, stepped in with a hefty donation and the promise to raise even more. The fact that Casey's company is based in Boston -- the very place Louie was headed -- had nothing to do with why he got involved. ""That was a random coincidence,"" he told CNN. ""I did it because the Corbetts are my next-door neighbors."" Casey makes the 24-hour-plus trek from his Auckland home to his office in downtown Boston every six weeks. He got Air New Zealand to pick up Louie's airfare tab and donated his own points as well. Casey and his partners at Ceiba Solutions agreed to pay for the trip no matter how much was raised while friends and strangers from opposite sides of the planet donated about $25,000 in just four weeks. ""It is so touching,"" Catherine Corbett said. ""People are just so supportive."" The fundraising campaign soon picked up steam on social media, reaching strangers far and wide. ""Somebody Tweeted me an article about this boy in New Zealand and told me I should read it,"" said Corinne Grousbeck, who lives outside of Boston. Grousbeck is the incoming chair of the trustees at the Perkins School for the Blind, one of the oldest schools for the visually impaired in the country. Her son, 21-year-old Campbell, was blinded by a condition similar to Louie's. ""I completely understood where the Corbetts were coming from in wanting to build a visual memory bank for (Louie),"" Grousbeck said. ""It's an incredibly difficult thing to have to go through."" But that wasn't the only coincidence; Grousbeck's husband just so happens to own the Boston Celtics. ""Of course when I read about how he was a big Celtics fan, I knew that we had to have him come for a game,"" she said. The coincidences didn't end there. When Grousbeck learned that the Corbetts would be coming to Boston for their game on March 5, she realized she would be unable to give Louie her seats because she had given them away. ""March 5th had coincidentally been scheduled as Perkins School for the Blind Night at the TD Garden (home of the Celtics),"" she said. ""We'd already given away our seats to the school's students, families and donors."" While Grousbeck made sure Louie and his family had great seats -- practically on the Celtics bench --  she says the real show was the Perkins chorus singing the national anthem. ""I think for a 12-year-old like Louie, for him to be able to watch visually-impaired kids perform the national anthem on a national stage, for him to see what blind people can achieve, that's going to give him the lasting memory,"" she said. And his Boston trip was filled with other coincidences as well. He spent the day Tuesday at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, whose cutting-edge ocular research may one day turn Louie's ""farewell to vision"" tour into simply one heck of a trip. Those odds might be long, but smart money wouldn't bet against Louie. He seems to have serendipity on his side.","Doctors say Louis Corbett, 12, will soon lose his vision due to rare disease .
He is going on a trip to see as many beautiful images as possible .
He attended a Celtics game, thanks to the generous donations of many ."
"Katniss Everdeen emerged victorious in ""The Hunger Games,"" and it was Snow White (rather than a charming prince) who defeated her evil stepmother in both film adaptations she starred in this year. Even Bella Swan, the formerly weak and needy protagonist of the ""The Twilight Saga,"" was confident and fearless in the franchise's final installment. This year's influx of big screen heroines appears to be a leap toward equality, prompting praise from film critics such as A.O. Scott of The New York Times. Off screen, however, things were a little more complicated. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" actress Jessica Chastain has garnered praise for her turn as Maya, the CIA agent -- aka ""the girl"" -- who led the hunt for Osama bin Laden. Meanwhile, Kathryn Bigelow's success as the film's director comes saddled with commentary that she, as Bret Easton Ellis pointed out via Twitter, is ""a very hot woman."" ""Kathryn Bigelow would be considered a mildly interesting filmmaker if she was a man,"" the author posted this month. He has since apologized for the tweet, noting Bigelow's ""The Hurt Locker"" ""felt like it was directed by a man. Its testosterone level was palpable, whereas in Sofia Coppola's work you're aware of a much softer presence behind the camera."" In the world of animation, while ""Brave's"" heroine Merida trounced her suitors in an archery competition for her hand, Pixar replaced Brenda Chapman as the film's director. (Mark Andrews and Chapman now share the directing credit.) The ousted director opened up about her experience as a woman attempting to infiltrate the ""Hollywood Boy's Club"" with The New York Times in August, writing, ""This was a story that I created, which came from a very personal place, as a woman and a mother. To have it taken away and given to someone else, and a man at that, was truly distressing on so many levels."" Despite accounts of inequality, 2012 has been dubbed the year of the woman, and with good reason, given the many strong female characters and women breaking through in the entertainment industry as well as our culture at large. Not only will a record 20 women hold U.S. Senate seats next year, but women voters also greatly influenced the 2012 election, making an impact in swing states such as Ohio. As founder of reelgirl.com Margot Magowan says, Hollywood needs to catch up. The sheer increase of strong female characters isn't enough, Magowan said, noting that role models such as ""Wreck-It Ralph's"" Vanellope (voiced by Sarah Silverman) are often secondary characters. ""It's important for the female to be the star of the movie,"" the mom of three girls said. "" 'Harry Potter' has Hermione, but her role is to help Harry on his quest. ... You can be the first lady, but you can't be the president. ... If you can't imagine it, you can't be it."" Hollywood overachievers Mindy Kaling and Lena Dunham have enjoyed success this year; both women created TV shows -- ""The Mindy Project"" and ""Girls,"" respectively -- in which they also star. Embodying versions of the everywoman, their characters Mindy Lahiri and Hannah Horvath don't ignore their curves, a simple but subversive statement in image-conscious Hollywood. Before ""Girls"" debuted on HBO in April, Dunham told CNN, ""I don't look like everybody that you usually see on television. I wanted to make sure to cast actresses who were beautiful, but beautiful the way that your sexiest friend is beautiful, not beautiful the way that someone who is on a CW show is beautiful."" Dunham is undeniably an up-and-coming 20-something powerhouse, but instead of her merits, public focus was placed on her body and the lack of racial diversity on her show. When she was criticized for alleged nepotism, she shot back, telling The B.S. Report's Bill Simmons, ""I really did want to challenge all the people crying nepotism to actually tell me who either of my parents were, because it's the contemporary art world."" Outrage continued when reports surfaced in October that Dunham signed a book deal with Random House for $3.7 million. Sure, that's a good chunk of change in exchange for tales of poetry camp and vegan dinner parties, but it's no more outrageous than the deals offered to her A-list counterparts. Dunham also came under fire for the things her ""Girls"" character did between the sheets. Noting the sometimes disquieting -- but realistic -- sex scenes, columnist Frank Bruni wrote, ""You watch these scenes and other examples of the zeitgeist-y, early-20s heroines of 'Girls' engaging in, recoiling from, mulling and mourning sex, and you think: Gloria Steinem went to the barricades for this?"" And while Kristen Stewart starred as two different empowered heroines, in the real world, her ""indiscretion"" with ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" director Rupert Sanders had the public branding her with a scarlet ""A."" In some of the coverage, Sanders was portrayed as a victim in the scandal, while Stewart was called a ""trampire."" Back on the big screen, Stewart's Snow White character was berated for being too masculine by critics such as Debbie Schlussel. ""I know it's a fairy tale, but since when was Snow White a she-man warrior?"" Schlussel wrote on her website in June. ""Uh, sorry, but reality check: men are the strong ones and the ones in physical fighting who win and best women."" Around the same time, Sanders explained Stewart's tough Snow White character to USA Today, saying, ""I love to play against expectations. ... I made a decision not to have Kristen do anything that she wouldn't realistically be able to do. No Bruce Lee or 'Braveheart' moves. She is not on a killing rampage. The men follow her into battle because of the spirit within her."" In 2006, while accepting an award from Equality Now (an organization promoting the human rights of women), Joss Whedon (""The Avengers,"" ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") said he's often asked why he creates such strong women characters. His response: ""Why aren't you asking 100 other guys why they don't write strong women characters?"" Now, more women are entering the conversation themselves such as Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, who wrote last year's hit  ""Bridesmaids"" starring an all-female ensemble cast. Strong female characters are also becoming more prevalent. There's The CW's new Robin Hood drama, ""Sherwood,"" which will have a female lead, according to The Hollywood Reporter, and Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock's buddy comedy, ""The Heat,"" which is expected to hit theaters in April. In January, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler will co-host the 70th annual Golden Globes (the first time any woman -- let alone two -- will helm the event without a male co-host), proving that the so-called ""year"" of the woman shows no signs of slowing down.","Influx of big screen heroines appears to be a leap toward equality .

"A Lowndes County, Georgia, assistant district attorney has ordered a communications company to hand over Internet records after investigators received an anonymous e-mail claiming an ex-schoolmate reportedly confessed to killing Kendrick Johnson. CNN obtained the e-mail and the subpoena on Monday, in response to a state Open Records Act request submitted to the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office. The anonymous e-mail tip is dated January 27.  The sender of the e-mail does not suggest he or she personally witnessed a confession; instead, the sender claims to have been told information by somebody who purportedly was aware of a confession in the 2013 death by one of the people implicated in the e-mail. Johnson's body was found in a rolled-up mat in the Lowndes High School gymnasium on January 11, 2013. Investigators with the sheriff's office ruled his death accidental, concluding that Johnson climbed into the center of the gym mat to reach for a shoe and got stuck. Feds subpoena schoolmates amid probe into teen's death . According to an incident report provided to CNN by the sheriff's office, investigators interviewed two of four students identified by name in the anonymous e-mail on January 28. Both students acknowledged they knew the 17-year-old Johnson but denied any involvement in his death. The incident report does not indicate whether the investigators attempted to speak with the two other students identified in the e-mail. CNN is not naming the students mentioned in the e-mail because none of them has been named a suspect in the death of Johnson. Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluded Johnson got stuck while reaching for a shoe at the center of the mat and that his death was accidental.  The state's medical examiner agreed, citing ""positional asphyxia"" as the cause of death. Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson believe their son was beaten to death and officials are ""covering up a murder.""  An independent pathologist, hired by Johnson's parents, concluded Johnson's death was the result of a homicide after finding evidence of ""unexplained apparent non-accidental blunt force trauma"" to Johnson's neck. ""If anybody has any information of a different opinion that they can provide to us, we're certainly open to looking at that.  We're not closed-minded on this,"" Lt. Stryde Jones, supervisor of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office's Investigative Division told CNN in May. The sheriff's office has received many public comments regarding Johnson's death since it closed its case on May 2.  The grand jury subpoena is the first document provided to CNN that suggests the department has acted on any of those public comments. ""Although our case has been closed, if evidence comes forward, specifically testimony, then we're open to hearing that and certainly we'll act accordingly,"" Lt. Jones said. Chief Assistant District Attorney Bradfield Shealy issued the subpoena to Mediacom Communications Corporation on January 28.  The New York-based cable, phone and Internet provider was ordered to provide the Lowndes County grand jury with subscriber information associated with the e-mail sent through the Lowndes County sheriff's office's website or submit the documents to the district attorney's office or Lt. Jones before February 26. According to a Lowndes County Sheriff's Office incident report, the subpoena was faxed to Mediacom on February 7. The company intends to comply with the order.  However, a Mediacom employee told CNN by phone Wednesday that Mediacom has not received the subpoena. Last week, students from Lowndes High School and nearby Valdosta High School were among those who appeared before a federal grand jury in Macon, as part of the Department of Justice's investigation into Johnson's death.  The U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, Michael Moore, launched the federal probe October 31.","Kendrick Johnson's body was found in a rolled-up mat in his high school gym .

"Exactly a year ago, more than 1,000 people lost their lives when a nine-story factory building collapsed suddenly in Dhaka. It was one of the darkest days in Bangladesh's recent history. The majority of those killed or injured were garment workers, but they represented just a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of people employed in hundreds of factories dotted around the Bangladeshi capital. Unfortunately, the Rana Plaza catastrophe on April 24, 2013 was not unique. Only five months earlier, 117 workers died when a fire ripped through the Tazreen clothing factory on the outskirts of Dhaka. The Rana Plaza disaster in Dhaka's Savar district did, however, spark an international outcry about the conditions millions of Bangladeshi workers endure each day: Those who were killed spent their last moments working for a pittance, manufacturing clothes for major global brands in appalling conditions. As a result, the Bangladeshi government, along with international organizations and foreign retailers, pledged to compensate victims' grieving families and improve the state of factories across the country. A year on and those efforts are continuing though many promises remain unfulfilled. Safety measures are being improved and more stringent standards are being introduced. However, compensation to victims' families remains shrouded in uncertainty. ""The incident was a wake-up call,"" Farah Kabir, country director for British charity ActionAid told CNN. ""Efforts are being taken on different levels in terms of safety and other related matters. But in terms of the rights of workers, that issue is unsolved. It has been one year and there is no coordinated plan to provide compensation."" Empty promises? After widespread criticism of workers' rights, the government revised its labor laws. Under the Bangladesh Labor (Amendment) Act, workers no longer need approval from employers to form trade unions, and every factory that sells within the country also has to pledge 5% of their profits toward a workers' welfare fund. The government also boosted minimum wages from $38 to around $68 per month. Yet for many thousands of families affected by the 2013 disaster, there is little or no respite. Najneen Akter Nazma and her husband, Jewel, were employed in two different garment factories located at Rana Plaza. When the whole building came crashing down that morning, Nazma, who was pregnant with her first child, was pulled out of the rubble by a rescuer. But Jewel wasn't as fortunate. Support from charity organizations helped Nazma pay the medical bills, while the meager government aid enabled her to cover her husband's funeral costs. Now she struggles to make ends meet. ""Compensation! What's that? I haven't received anything yet, not even for my son,"" she told ActionAid after the tragedy. According to Nazma, even individual donors have stopped sending money. ""Who cares about a dead man in such a country where the living people even cannot enjoy their rights?"" Nazma's story resonates with many other survivors interviewed by ActionAid. According to a recent survey carried out by the charity, 74% of 1,436 survivors of the disaster who were interviewed continue to nurse their injuries and their ongoing trauma. A small number claim they have been refused jobs in other garment factories because they say employers are reluctant to hire them amid fears they might engage in labor activism. Disagreements continue between the government, factory owners and foreign retailers over who should contribute to compensation, with observers suggesting this would be an admission of guilt. This has further slowed the disbursement of claims. ""There has been haphazard financial aid -- some coming from employers, some from the prime minister's fund. There is no coordination,"" says ActionAid's Kabir. She says only $3 million of the $16 million set aside in the prime minister's fund had been distributed, as of a month ago. Following the disaster, international organizations and trade unions pledged a fund of $40 million to aid those affected. The International Labour Organization is running this trust fund, and payments from it will be released to the victims by a claims process. However, according to a joint statement released by global trade unions IndustriALL and UNI, along with the labor rights network Clean Clothes campaign, the fund has been able to raise only a third of that amount so far. Only half of the 29 global brands and retailers that sourced garments from the factories in the plaza have contributed to this fund, including Loblaw, Bonmarche, Mango and Premier Clothing. ""Nearly all brands have failed to make a significant enough contribution and we are calling on them to increase their donations immediately,"" the statement said. One of the biggest contributors, British fashion chain Primark is also offering long-term compensation amounting to $9 million for the workers employed in factories producing garments for the company. The brand's website says payments began last month and the whole process will be completed by June this year. Safety standards . At present Bangladesh has less than 200 qualified inspectors and officials have said it will take at least five years to check working and safety conditions in all factories. In February, the government issued orders to increase the number of labor and factory inspectors to 575. Two initiatives introduced last year have tried to improve conditions for employees in the $20 billion dollar garments industry in Bangladesh. One pact -- the Bangladesh Accord for Fire and Building Safety is a legally binding initiative that mandates signatory companies to undertake inspections of garment factories as well as training of workers. So far, 150 companies have signed the accord, including European retailers like H&M and Benetton. The Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety is a voluntary, industry-sponsored agreement to provide similar measures. It includes 26 brands, all of them American or Canadian, among them Wal-Mart. The Alliance has inspected 400 of the 640 factories used by the organization's members, a process it plans to complete by July, while the Bangladesh Accord plans to inspect a total 1,500 factories by September for electrical, fire and building safety. Inspections have so far revealed an unflattering picture. ""There is not one factory that doesn't need improvement,"" says Ian Spaulding, senior adviser to the Alliance. ""The majority of them do not have the necessary protection to prevent fire hazards -- a sprinkler system, fire doors, adequate water capacity to suppress fire."" The Alliance has ordered one factory to be shut down and recommended the closure of another. However, efforts to implement stricter measures are drawing the ire of garment factory associations and trade unions, who say the industry doesn't have the necessary infrastructure nor the finances to adhere to these standards. Others are concerned about the loss of income to workers if the factories close down for renovation. Turning pledges into action . Several solutions are being suggested by the two groups and foreign retailers: Allowing garment manufacturers in the country easy access to loans, giving businesses tax holidays to help them renovate factories, and compensating workers for any loss of income incurred due to the temporary suspension. The garment industry is Bangladesh's largest export earner. Many fear worker safety issues are all too often ignored in the interests of greater trade, with some alleging that during any crises the national garment industry association sides with the owners. Following the incident, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasin told CNN that she wasn't worried about international companies stalling their business in the country. ""Investors have tapped into the Bangladeshi market not just because of its high-quality workers,"" she said. ""They get cheap labor. That's why they come here."" According to Kabir, there needs to be coordinated efforts and accountability from all stakeholders -- the government, factory owners and retailers. Otherwise, ""Rana Plaza like Tazreen will be forgotten,"" she says. ""This past year, we have seen a lot of pledges from brands, manufacturers and the government.  We need to see them translate that into action, transaction and political commitment.""

"(CNN) -- U.S. officials say that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a fairly new arm of the umbrella terrorist organization, is behind an apparent plot to send explosive devices to U.S. destinations via cargo planes. ""Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is an organization of several hundred individuals that are dispersed throughout the country,"" presidential counterterrorism advisor John Brennan told reporters Friday. ""They are murderers and they are determined to carry out attacks on innocent lives, whether they be Yemeni, Americans, Westerners or others. ... ""If anything, this just demonstrates to us and, I think to the Yemenis as well, that we need to redouble our efforts so that we're able to destroy al Qaeda, and we will."" Brennan pointed to the botched attempt last Christmas to blow up a Northwest Airlines passenger jet en route from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit, Michigan, on Christmas Day. U.S. and Yemeni officials have linked the attempt by man who tried to ignite explosives in his underwear to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Formed in 2009, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is a regional terrorist group known for targeting government and Western interests in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Yemeni forces, with support from their U.S. allies, have stepped up military and political pressure on the group in recent weeks, despite continued threats from its leader. A key figure in the group is Yemeni-American militant cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, whom U.S. authorities have linked to Fort Hood shooting suspect Maj. Nidal Hasan as well as the man accused in the Christmas Day bomb attempt. Brennan would not specifically name al-Awlaki as a suspect. ""Anybody who's associated with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is a subject of concern,"" he said. ""Clearly what we are doing is looking at all individuals that we think might be involved in this,"" Brennan said. ""Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has been rather open in its venom towards the United States, towards Western interests. There are a number of individuals there that we're concerned about, so we're looking at all possibilities."" A senior U.S. defense official called al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula a ""sophisticated"" organization. Combating the terror group has been a major focus for U.S. counterterrorism authorities, with Friday's incident underscoring the need for U.S. cooperation with Yemen, Obama said Friday. ""We ... know that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula continues to plan attacks against our homeland, our citizens, and our friends and allies,"" said Obama. ""Going forward, we will continue to strengthen our cooperation with the Yemeni government ... to destroy this al Qaeda affiliate."" Brennan said he talked Friday with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh about the threat posed by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and how to address it, receiving assurances from the Yemeni leader that they'd cooperate on the investigation. These high-level talks are the latest in a series of collaborative efforts between U.S. and Yemeni officials and forces. Earlier this year, the United States approved $150 million to train and equip Yemeni forces so they could fight al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Up to 50 U.S. special operations troops are now in the Middle Eastern country training Yemen's military personnel. In addition, Yemeni and U.S. authorities have been sharing surveillance and other intelligence information culled from inside Yemen, a senior U.S. defense official said. But Yemen announced Friday via its official news agency, Saba, that the army had ended its latest campaign against AQAP without finding any elements of the terror group. ""We found traces in the area of Khawaw indicating that al Qaeda elements were in this region three days ago,"" said Mahdi Abdul-Salam, a commander of the military campaign, adding that the extremist organization is no longer in the al-Kur mountain range in Yemen's southeast. Many of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's members previously belonged to al Qaeda in Yemen. The National Counterterrorism Center says that group carried out suicide attacks on a Yemeni oil facility in 2006 and mortar attacks two years later on the U.S. Embassy in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, Yemeni military complexes, the Italian Embassy and the Yemeni presidential compound. Later in 2008, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula detonated two car bombs outside the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, killing 19 people, including six of its own members, according to the National Counterterrorism Center. Since forming under its new name, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has been tied to a pair of suicide bombings that targeted South Korean tourists. On Monday, 15 suspected members of the group surrendered in Yemen's southern Abyan province, according to provincial Gov. Ahmed al-Maisari. The surrenders followed meetings with the governor and tribal sheikhs in the towns of Loudar and Moudeya. Earlier in the month, Qassim al-Rimi (also known as Abu Hurira al-Sanaei), the military commander of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, posted an audio recording on radical militant websites. The speaker promised that Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, would be punished ""for his crimes"" and announced that a new army would rid the country of ""crusaders and apostates."" CNN could not verify the authenticity of the recording.","NEW: Yemeni authorities call off operations to search for AQAP in mountains .

"A 10-day Royal Caribbean cruise ship will return two days early after an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness, the cruise line said Sunday. According to Bernadette Burden, a spokeswoman with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 600 people on the ship have become ill. Passengers and crew members reported vomiting and diarrhea. ""New reports of illness have decreased day-over-day, and many guests are again up and about. Nevertheless, the disruptions caused by the early wave of illness means that we were unable to deliver the vacation our guests were expecting,""  the cruise line said in a statement. ""After consultation between our medical team and representatives of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we think the right thing to do is to bring our guests home early, and use the extra time to sanitize the ship even more thoroughly,"" the company said. Explorer of the Seas left January 21 from Cape Liberty, New Jersey, and it has been in the Caribbean. After returning to its home port on Wednesday, the cruise line said it would perform a ""thorough 'barrier' sanitization program on the entire ship to make certain that any remaining traces of the illness are eliminated."" The cause of the illness was not immediately clear, though symptoms are consistent with norovirus, the cruise line said. Noroviruses spread easily and are a common cause of gastroenteritis, which produces vomiting and diarrhea. According to Burden, the CDC spokeswoman, 577 of the 3,050 passengers and 49 of 1,165 crew members reported being ill. Joseph Angelillo was one such person. He said he thought, at first, he just had food poisoning. ""I started with upset stomach and vomiting, and that lasted all night and into the morning,"" he told CNN by phone Sunday. He said some entertainers were sick and shows had to be canceled. ""If I can get off (the ship), I will,"" Angelillo said. What you need to know about kids and norovirus .

"(CNN) -- Arnold Schwarzenegger is, uh, back. And so is the whole ""Terminator"" universe: morphing machines, the industrious version of Sarah Connor and a sometimes-befuddled Kyle Reese.

"Mohamad Chatah, a former Lebanese finance minister and ambassador to the United States, died Friday when a car bomb struck his convoy in downtown Beirut, Lebanon's National News Agency reported. The blast killed six others and left 71 wounded, Lebanon's state news agency said. Cars were burned beyond recognition as a wall of flames and thick black smoke shot up from the blast site. Chatah's bodyguard, Mohammed Badr, was among those killed, the news agency said. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack. Chatah's last tweet, posted about an hour before his death, talked about Hezbollah, the Lebanese-based Shiite militant group with which Chatah was at odds. ""#Hezbollah is pressing hard to be granted similar powers in security & foreign policy matters that Syria exercised in Lebanon for 15 yrs,"" Chatah tweeted. That group decried the attack in a statement aired on Hezbollah TV, saying the it ""only benefits the enemies of Lebanon."" The group called on ""all the security and judicial agencies to be on high alert to expose the perpetrators and bring them to justice."" Chatah was known as a staunch critic of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom he accused of meddling in Lebanon's internal affairs. Hezbollah has sent fighters to help al-Assad's forces in the Syrian civil war. ""A united and  peaceful Syria ruled by Assad is simply not possible anymore. It has been like that for some time,"" Chatah wrote in his last blog post. ""The status quo ante cannot be restored. Iran and Hezbollah realize this more than anyone else."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry condemned the killing of Chatah, whom he called ""a voice of reason, responsibility and moderation."" ""His presence will be missed, but his vision for a united Lebanon, free from sectarian violence and destabilizing interference, will continue to guide our efforts,"" Kerry said in a written statement.  ""Indeed, his tragic end reminds all of us just why his vision remains so imperative."" Syrian war spills over into Lebanon . More than 100,000 people have died in Syria's civil war in which al-Assad's forces are battling rebels seeking an end to his family's four-decade dynasty. Al-Assad and the core of his regime are Alawites, members of an offshoot of Shiite Islam, but most Syrians and a large portion of the rebels are Sunni. The war has spilled across the border into Lebanon. Dozens have been killed there in largely sectarian violence, including dual bombings last month that left 23 dead in Beirut. The Abdullah Azzam Brigades, a Sunni jihadist group linked to al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for those bombings. The group warned that more attacks would come unless Hezbollah stopped sending fighters to support Syrian regime forces. Chatah graduated from American University in Beirut and was Lebanon's ambassador to the United States from 1997 to 1999, according to his blog. Chatah also was a senior adviser for former Prime Minister Saad Hariri and was the finance minister in former Prime Minister Fouad Siniora's Cabinet in 2008 and 2009. Hariri issued a statement Friday condemning the killing, calling it ""yet another terrorist message sent to us, we the free men of Lebanon in the Future Movement and March 14 coalition."" Hariri's ""March 14 coalition"" is a pro-Western, Sunni-dominated bloc. It takes its name from the day in 2005 when thousands gathered in Beirut a month after the assassination of Hariri's father, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, to demand an end to the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. Saad Hariri said the bombers ""want to assassinate Lebanon and humiliate and weaken the State."" ""The signatories of the message do not hide their fingerprints,"" he said. ""They will continue on the criminal path and will insist on dragging Lebanon into the abyss of discord, as long as there is in Lebanon some who provide cover for those crimes, who ask to bury the heads in the sand and who justify the proliferation of weapons and the rise of the armed groups at the expense of the State and its institutions."" On Friday, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati posted a tweet saying he is calling off his vacation and heading back to Lebanon. ""I condemn this assassination, which targeted a political, an academic, a moderate and an upscale figure who always believed in dialogue and the language of reason, logic and the right to have a different opinion,"" Mikati said. Chatah was married and had two children. His death comes 20 days before the U.N.-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon begins the trial of four Hezbollah suspects over the 2005 assassination of Rafik Hariri. Like Chatah, Hariri was also killed in a car bombing.","Death toll rises to 7 .

"Designer Ralph Lauren is making model-related headlines again. The last time this happened, it was when the iconic American brand digitally altered model Filippa Hamilton into a biologically impossible state, rendering her waist and pelvis in miniature and leaving the rest of her body normal-sized. Astute critics noticed and spoke up. It didn't help matters when Hamilton herself stated that she was allegedly fired by the brand for being ""too fat"" by fashion world metrics. More recently, however, the Ralph Lauren brand has made attempts to improve its image and hired Australian plus-size model Robyn Lawley, who stands 6-foot-2 and wears a size 12, for a print campaign. After the public relations nightmare with Hamilton, many have heralded this choice as a positive sign of improvement in a fashion industry that overwhelmingly hires and promotes models who are far thinner than the average American woman. We asked, you answered: Are we really ready to take a look at 'real women'? As is often the case when any plus-size model makes news, many are eager to hold this up as a victory for ""real women,"" that anonymous majority who so rarely get to see themselves portrayed in fashion images. But don't get too enthusiastic with the back-patting just yet. This is not a revolutionary moment, any more than it has been any other time a mainstream designer has plucked a nonwaifish model from the depths of the plus-size-modeling dungeon and made her, however briefly, a public curiosity. Fashion is famously fickle, and if Ralph Lauren has chosen to showcase this particular model at this particular moment, it may have nothing to do with making some grand political statement or a significant change of heart and everything to do with generating buzz. Of course, I can't know the brand's intentions for certain. But in the larger context, even widespread use of plus-size models doesn't signal the evolution of a movement away from the impossible feminine physical ideal; it's just taking that ideal and making it a tiny bit bigger. It is the business of both fashion and its models to represent fantasy, and even plus-size versions are regularly digitally altered. Like their smaller peers, these models also have their skin smoothed, their waists and thighs whittled and their many human imperfections, from cellulite to flyaways, fully erased long before their image ever hits the side of a bus or the page of a magazine. Even plus-size models are still perfectly proportional and almost impossibly beautiful. They still present an aspirational standard that is unattainable if only because the resulting image doesn't resemble the real-life model. 'Fatshion' bloggers find beauty in all sizes . So Lawley is slightly more accessible than Hamilton. This is like observing that it would be easier for us to flap our arms and fly to the moon than it would be to fly to Mars; the moon might be closer, but we're still not going to get there. And neither are the vast majority of American women. There's nothing wrong with fantasy. Fantasy is fun, and the fashion industry does it as well as Hollywood. Why can't we relate to fashion images for what they are -- imaginary worlds with beautiful people who don't really exist? Why insist that they represent reality in some way? Why are we so in love with the idea of seeing ""real women,"" whatever that represents? We've all seen what happens when actual ""real"" bodies make news. The most recent whipping girl for the crime of failing to be perfect is Lady Gaga, whose recent photos from a concert in Paris have had practically everyone on the planet hypothesizing how she could allow herself to suffer such a horrible fate as to put on a few pounds. Critics and fans have suggested everything from drug abuse to pregnancy. Gaga, for her part, simply credits eating a lot of tasty food at her father's restaurant. 'Half': One woman's struggle with weight loss . Lady Gaga has unashamedly shown off her body onstage in spite of her changing weight, refusing to apologize, and the response has ranged from shock, to disgust, to ""concern,"" to schadenfreude-driven laughter. Gaga has since responded by launching a new section on her website entitled ""Body Revolution,"" kicking things off by sharing pictures of her own body (and acknowledging the eating disorders that have shaped her) while soliciting fans to share their own insecurities. It is telling that the initial public response was not to applaud Gaga for being ""real,"" but to shame her for being imperfect. We don't like to be reminded of how much effort it sometimes takes to meet the ideal, even for those whose profession hinges on maintaining a certain appearance. We like to think it's easy and natural; we like to think anyone who fails at it just didn't try hard enough. But real bodies, like reality itself, are complicated and diverse, as well as unpredictably changeable. For all our vocal support in favor of seeing so-called ""real women,"" we forget that all women are real, no matter their size or their shape or their age or whether they are conventionally attractive. Real women are everywhere. The biggest problem with this nebulous concept of ""real women"" and our desire to see more of them is that it is intrinsically hypocritical. The truth is, we want to see ""real women"" when they look like Robyn Lawley in a Ralph Lauren ad, coiffed and digitally altered into that brand's iconic and immaculate horse-riding fantasy world. We don't want to see ""real women"" when they look like us. Maybe that's the disconnect we ought to be working on, instead of applauding Ralph Lauren's choice of models on one side while condemning Lady Gaga for being, well, ""real"" on the other. Do you think the public really wants to see non-model types in ads and entertainment?

"(CNN) -- Twenty-five-year-old New Yorker Aubura Taylor graduated with honors from college, where he was a football standout. He told us he goes to church regularly and is not involved in gangs or drugs. By any objective standard, there is no reason for police to be bothering him. But he says they are a constant presence in his life. This summer, he recorded an interaction on his cell phone camera. ""Get inside, and get the f--k out of there!"" the video begins, with a uniformed cop cursing from his cruiser as Taylor and a friend shelter from the rain at the entrance of his grandmother's housing development waiting for a ride to their boxing gym. ""Why are you talking to me like that?"" Taylor asks incredulously. ""Get inside,"" the cop repeats again, walking toward them and kicking open the door to the building, ""or I'll handcuff you."" ""I'm not even doing anything."" ""Get inside, now!"" Most Americans know about what happened to Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.  And many know about the choke hold death of Eric Garner by police in Staten Island, New York. Grand juries are reviewing evidence in both cases and we could soon learn if there will be criminal charges against the officers involved. But between these and other high profile cases are the invisible daily struggles of blacks like Taylor who live and work in what police departments across the nation identify as ""high-crime"" communities, and are policed with the assumption of criminality. Taylor's video didn't go viral or make the nightly news because the cop didn't beat, arrest or kill him, fortunately. But it's regular interactions like these that are sending a message that your rights matter less to the police when you're black. These and more invasive kinds of persistent police interactions fueled a landmark lawsuit in New York, which resulted in an unprecedented ruling against the New York Police Department, ordering it to amend its ""stop and frisk"" practice. They also helped lead to the election of a reform-minded mayor in the city. But nearly a year into Bill de Blasio's first term, we were told countless times during our reporting for this film that qualitatively little has changed in the relationship between minorities and the police. And though the number of stops is down dramatically, New York's new police commissioner, William Bratton, has largely replaced it in minority communities with ""broken windows"" policing. The broken windows theory suggests that by aggressively focusing on low-level crime and disorder you can discourage more serious crimes. ""Order maintenance,"" ""zero-tolerance,"" and proactive policing are its hallmarks. Bratton credited it with reducing crime when he was the city's police commissioner in the early '90s under Mayor Rudy Giuliani. But many experts, like professor Alex Vitale of Brooklyn College, doubt the correlation. ""Crime rates dropped over the last 20 years in hundreds of cities around the world, in places that have never even heard of broken windows,"" he says. The department justifies its continued use by saying crime and disorder would rise again if it was abandoned. And so its aggressive policing with a focus on high numbers of misdemeanor arrests continues in minority neighborhoods, even though violent crime is at all-time lows. Vitale believes the police need to be reined in. Bratton once seemed to think so as well. In the '90s when crime was falling in New York, according to Patrick Lyons of The New York Times, Bratton said citizens in heavily patrolled neighborhoods deserved a ""peace dividend,"" a break from overzealous policing. But many say that's not the way it's playing out on the streets today. In an interview for our documentary, Bratton conceded that arrest and summons quotas are likely still practiced in some precincts, though he does not condone them. Combined with broken windows-style enforcement, it is a potentially dangerous mix. That mix doesn't always turn deadly, as in the case of Eric Garner, but these aggressive and invasive interactions are having a generational impact and fueling events like what the nation witnessed in Ferguson and Staten Island. And these interactions are also perpetuating distrust of police among minorities in New York. This summer, a spate of citizen-recorded videos showed NYPD interventions and arrests going awry because citizens seemingly didn't agree with the justifications for the encounters. ""It's a sign of a breakdown of police legitimacy, Vitale said, ""And once we head down that road, if it's not fixed, it's going to produce more and bigger confrontations."" It's bad for the police and bad for the city. Any criminologist will tell you that police solve more crimes when members of the public help them catch the criminals. But, the more the public is alienated, the less helpful they will be. Like Aubura Taylor, most of the men and women we interviewed said they don't trust the police. They try to steer clear of them and avoid any verbal communication. Some community activists, like former NYPD cop Carlton Berkeley, even counsel minorities to say nothing when approached by the police. Berkeley's advice, ""All you have to say is 'am I under arrest?' And if not, 'then am I free to go?'"" Critics of reform claim that excessive police oversight and scrutiny is tantamount to being soft on crime, and as a result will make the city less safe, returning it to early '90s, crack-epidemic-era crime levels, and making it more hospitable to terrorists. But the flip side is that the relentless wholesale targeting of black men in high-crime areas is creating a far more precarious future for beat cops, criminalized minorities and the city. The resounding cry in communities of color is that a new approach and a new police culture are needed. As de Blasio's first year in office winds down, he has an opportunity to honor his pledge to renew trust. The federal ruling in the stop and frisk case contained a list of remedies. All the barriers to those remedies being enacted disappeared when the final appeal was tossed out last month. The recently announced policy change to stop arresting people who possess less than 25 grams of marijuana, according to some critics, may only slightly reduce the number of arrests and does not address the root problem of disparate enforcement where blacks and Latinos make up 86% of marijuana arrests, despite equal use across demographic lines. An incremental policy change does not address the ongoing complaints among minorities that they feel targeted, and that this department and ones across the country lack a racially inclusive vision for policing. When Taylor showed us his video, no one outside his circle had seen it before. ""I was planning on giving it to a reporter,"" he said, ""because I want people to know how we're still scared of the NYPD and we don't know what to do. We need somebody that can help us.""

"(CNN) -- It's a plot twist that even a thriller writer might have struggled to come up with during Serbia's European qualifying clash with Albania in Belgrade. A drone flying a flag depicting the ""Greater Albania"" over a major international soccer game Tuesday was the subject of a 'whodunnit' mystery after the brother of the Albanian prime minister hit back at allegations by a Serbian government official that he had been piloting the quadcopter. ""I am very disgusted by the allegation of my having any involvement in the piloting of the drone,"" Olsi Rama told CNN Wednesday, who said he had been taking pictures of the game from a VIP suite at the stadium. As a football match mushroomed into a diplomatic incident amid claim and counter-claim in a region of a world that is still riven by ethnic divisions, his version of events conflicted with Serbia's version of events. ""According to the information from the police he (Olsi Rama) was in possession of the navigator,"" said a Serbian official as the country's football federation labeled the drone flight a ""terrorist action planned in advance."" UEFA has confirmed that disciplinary proceedings have been opened against both teams. The game was abandoned after 41 minutes with players clashing after the flag was taken down by a Serbian player. Rama insisted the police's actions were part of a Serbian ""plot,"" after discovering he was the Albanian prime minister's brother. ""There were 50 or so Albanian guys who can say I didn't have the controller-- they searched everyone."" The Serbian prime minister's office also stated that Rama was arrested and sent home to Albania, a claim denied by the Albanian government's spokesman. ""There is no proof whatsoever and Olsi Rama was never arrested in Belgrade,"" Endri Fuga, communications director for the prime minister of Albania told CNN. ""He has nothing to do with the drone."" The contest, played at Partizan's stadium in Belgrade, was abandoned near the end of the first half following ugly scenes involving fans and players. ""When you have 32,000 people shouting kill, kill, kill Albanians, it's living in another dimension,"" said Rama. Albanian players ran from the field, while a number of missiles and flares were thrown from the stands by some home supporters. Images from photo agencies showed fans had invaded the pitch. ""What happened last night in Belgrade is truly sad,"" Fuga told CNN. ""The Albanian government firmly condemns the despicable expressions of racism and violence against the Albanian National team players. ""We put all of our trust in UEFA to conduct a fair investigation which sheds light on the truth of all that happened in the Belgrade Stadium, from the start of our national anthem to the very last moment that our squad left the stadium,"" added Fuga referring to European football's governing body. ""Football should never be mixed with politics and state politics cannot be driven by what happens in a football match."" Fuga believes the scenes witnessed in the Serbian capital offer ""further proof that the ghosts of the past"" that still haunt the Balkans. ""The false story that the Albanian prime minister's brother instigated the showdown of violence by launching a drone carrying a flag over the stadium, is a testament to the presence of harmful elements that wish to keep this region mired in the past,"" said Fuga, who explained Rama was one of a few dozen Albanians who attended the game with valid tickets provided by the country's football association. He says that the group were searched by police but not found to be carrying anything. ""The Albanian Prime Minister remains firmly committed to fostering this new, historical chapter of peace and cooperation,"" said Fuga. ""He will do all in his power to ensure it will not be closed by hatreds such as those which cast such a negative shadow on the football game."" Rama says that he was moved from the VIP box for security reasons and informed the authorities that he held American citizenship before being given a police escort to waiting buses. ""I tried with my broken Serbian to understand what was happening, but they said this is orders,"" he added. ""I had no involvement in the drone. When the banner came up we had no idea, we thought some Serbians set it up."" Prime Minister Rama is scheduled to arrive in Belgrade in the next few days -- the first such visit by an Albanian leader in 68 years. In a statement on its website, UEFA said that the match ""was abandoned and the circumstances will be reported to the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body."" UEFA spokesperson Pedro Pinto told CNN an announcement on sanctions against both countries are expected to be made within a week. Albania's first visit to Belgrade since 1967 was expected to be a tense occasion, though the events of Tuesday evening appeared to catch security authorities by surprise. The ""Greater Albania"" insignia, which was attached to the drone, refers to the idea of an extended area in which all ethnic Albanians reside -- one which would include Kosovo. The two illustrated figures on the flag were Isa Boletini, an Albanian nationalist who led uprisings against the Serbs and Ottomans in 1912 and 1913, while the other, Ismail Qemali, is considered to be the founder of the modern Albanian state, which became independent in 1912. The word ""Autochthonous,"" which refers to an indigenous inhabitant of a place, was emblazoned at the bottom of the flag and is considered an offense to Serbians. When Serbian player Stefan Mitrovic ripped the flag down, it provided the catalyst for an already combustible tie to fully ignite. Albanian players ran from the field, while a number of missiles and flares were thrown from the stands by some home supporters. Images from photo agencies showed fans had invaded the pitch. Martin Atkinson, the English referee, took the players off the field with the game goalless. ""What happened is something we can't comprehend at the moment,"" Serbia captain Branislav Ivanovic told reporters following the abandonment. ""On behalf of my team, all I can say is that we wanted to carry on and that we shielded the Albanian players every step of the way to the tunnel (after the riot broke out). ""The Albanian team said they were unfit physically and mentally to carry on after talking to the officials and they will now decide the fate of this match. ""We can only regret that football took a back seat but it is difficult to draw any conclusions or make any comments now."" Security had been tight in the lead up to the contest in Belgrade with away fans prevented from attending amidst heightening tensions over Kosovo -- a majority-Albanian former Serbian province which declared independence in 2008. In 1999, a 78-day air war was launched by NATO to stop the killing off ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by Serbian forces. Kosovo's independence is recognized by many countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and France -- but not Serbia. Four of Albania's starting lineup were born in Kosovo, with Lorik Cana of Italian club Lazio, goalkeeper Etrit Berisha, midfielder Burim Kukeli and Ermir Lenjani. With Kosovo not recognized as a state by the United Nations, it is unable to join FIFA or UEFA, meaning some of its players have adopted other countries. Xherdan Shaqiri, who plays his club football with Bayern Munich, represents Switzerland as does Valon Behrami and Granit Xhaka. While Kosovo is able to play friendly matches, the team cannot compete in international competition. Belgium-born Adnan Januzaj, one of the most exciting talents in the English Premier League with Manchester United, turned down the opportunity to play for Kosovo, where his father is from. He was also eligible for Albania through his mother's lineage. ""We came to Belgrade to play football, but we were physically attacked by the Serbian supporters,"" Cana told reporters on Tuesday. ""We just wanted to take the flag, and everything would be under control if the stadium security at the stadium had prevented the supporters from attacking our players. ""I was defending my teammate, I have injuries to my face, as does Taulant Xhaka. They asked us to play in front of empty stands (instead of abandonment) -- however, we did not feel good because of our injuries."" The two countries must now wait for UEFA to make a decision on whether the game should be replayed. and what punishments are handed out. ""It is a regretful situation on which we will report; the referee, myself and the security adviser. The circumstances were such that we couldn't continue the match,"" UEFA's match delegate, Harry Been told reporters. ""You all saw what happened and I cannot comment on who is to blame or what to blame. I will submit a report with my colleagues to UEFA and UEFA will decide what will happen further.""","Prime minister of Albania's brother hits back at allegations .

"It's a welcome sign with a caveat. President Barack Obama and Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius are urging people to try again on the problem-plagued Obamacare website, insisting it will work better by Saturday's self-imposed deadline to improve its performance from last month's botched launch. Meanwhile, the administration has been telling its allies to hold off for now on any campaigns to encourage people to sign up right away so that HealthCare.gov doesn't get overwhelmed once again this weekend. Officials fear another huge surge in volume that the site can't handle, which is what occurred around the October 1 launch of new insurance exchanges under Obama's signature health care reforms. The November 30 target for website improvements ""does not represent a relaunch of HealthCare.gov; it is not a magical date,"" said Julie Bataille, spokeswoman for the federal unit in charge of administering the rollout of the health care reforms. ""There will be times after November 30th when HealthCare.gov does not function properly."" In the latest problem with the website, it will be unable to enroll small businesses online for another year, Bataille told reporters on a conference call. Small businesses can enroll in other ways in the special small business system known as SHOP, but problems with HealthCare.gov have prevented their online enrollment so far. It was the third delay of the SHOP Marketplace component of the website, this time until November 2014. Until then, ""small businesses will be able to enroll directly in a SHOP plan through an insurer, agent or broker and can get certified for a tax credit after they enroll,"" Bataille said. The Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, doesn't require companies with fewer than 50 employees to buy insurance for workers, though workers are required to have coverage. If employers choose to provide coverage workers, they may qualify for subsidies to reduce their costs. ""We expect that making direct enrollment, tax credit applications and comparison shopping easier will help to ensure that small businesses can take full advantage of the marketplace and tax credits worth up to 50% of employee premiums in 2014,"" Bataille said. Supreme Court to take up Obamacare contraception case . However, the head of the International Franchise Association complained the delay in online enrollment made it harder for small business owners to get all the information they need to enroll. ""With this delay, it will also call into question how the small business tax credit is applied,"" said Steve Caldeira, the group's president and CEO. ""Not having the ability to apply electronically will now make this process more confusing, cumbersome and time-consuming for employers."" Republican opponents of Obamacare pounced on the news, with House Speaker John Boehner urging Obama to delay implementation of the entire Affordable Care Act. ""This law has been an absolute disaster, leaving us to ask 'what's next?'"" the Ohio Republican said in a statement. ""If the President won't repeal it, he should at least delay the entire law before it wreaks any more havoc on American families and small businesses, as well as our economy."" Wednesday's development came as the Obama administration prepared for a potential surge in online enrollment in response to its pledge to have the HealthCare.gov website functioning smoothly for most users by the end of November. According to a White House official, the administration suggested at a Monday meeting with allies that they not drive traffic to the website in the first week of December, following the November 30 deadline it set for website improvements. The administration wants to see how the website does before its supporters launch campaign efforts to boost enrollment, the official said. Recurring breakdowns, error messages and delays botched the federal web portal rollout, opening the reform effort to new and fierce Republican criticism while raising questions about the administration's ability to manage the health insurance overhaul. The GOP opposition targets the entire 2010 Affordable Care Act, not just the website woes, as the ultimate example of big government run amok. Despite the website woes, a new CNN/ORC International poll released Wednesday showed a majority of Americans believe the current Obamacare problems can be solved, and the figures for overall support and opposition remain little changed from a month ago. HealthCare.gov was originally planned to handle 50,000 concurrent users, and will reach that capacity by Saturday, the White House official said. However, big spikes in traffic -- such as the 200,000 who tried to get on at the same time on October 1 -- would cause users to go into a queue to receive an e-mail advising them when to return, the official said. Sebelius: Obamacare website improvements 'on track' Luke Chung, president and founder of Virginia-based software development company FMS Inc., said success for the website would be determined by both the number of users as well as how long they are in the system. He compared it to a highway, noting that 50,000 people traveling 60 miles per hour is smooth traffic while the same number going 10 miles per hour is a jam. In a conference call Tuesday with state and local officials, Sebelius said ""we are definitely on track to have a significantly different user experience by the end of this month -- that was our commitment -- than people experienced on October 1."" ""We've added hardware, we've added software; we're continuing to work on the parts of the website that were too confusing to people,"" she continued, urging the officials ""to not hesitate to recommend that people go to HealthCare.gov and get signed up because that experience is currently working much better and it will continue to work much better."" Obama also urged people to go to the website as part of remarks on the economy he made in California. Enrollment figures for the first month after the opening of the new health insurance exchanges under Obamacare were much lower than initially expected. Now some states have reported stronger numbers. According to a CNN count based on available figures, just a little more than 200,000 people have signed up for new private health insurance under Obamacare -- either through the national system or networks set up in 14 states and the District of Columbia. In addition, more than 370,000 have signed up for Medicaid under state programs expanded through the health care reforms, the CNN count shows. The enrollment period runs until March 31 and officials have said the target for the first year was seven million people. To ensure they have coverage starting on January 1, consumers must sign up by December 23, the administration recently announced. Boehner signs up for Obamacare, with government support . Chung cited December 23 as the most significant deadline, noting that demand would be ""huge"" because people by nature wait until the last minute to act. Also Wednesday, seven Democratic Senators including some up for re-election next year asked Obama to appoint a special health care overseer to ensure continuity in efforts to fix the problems. While Sebelius is technically the top administration official overseeing implementation of Obamacare, former White House aide Jeff Zients was brought in last month to oversee efforts to fix the troubled website. Zients will become a top economic adviser to Obama in January. In a letter to the president, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mark Warner of Virginia, Christopher Coons of Delaware, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Udall of Colorado and Tim Kaine of Virginia called for Obama to name a  successor to Zients. Separately,  an HHS official confirmed the government will go with a new web-hosting contractor, Hewlett-Packard, for HealthCare.gov early next year. The current contract with Terremark ends in March. The official said the decision to go with a different vendor was made several months before any problems with HealthCare.gov were identified and was unrelated to an outage that struck the site in late October, which the administration blamed on the Verizon subsidiary. The HP contract was signed in July.","November 30 not a magic restart for HealthCare.gov, official says .

"(CNN)The attack is harrowing: Al-Shabaab militants raid a quarry in Kenya, separating non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and executing them. The brutal act comes just days after the Islamists ambushed a bus and sprayed bullets on those who failed to recite Quran verses. The attacks reminded the world once again how brazen the group can be. What does Al-Shabaab want? Here's an explainer. What is Al-Shabaab, and what does it want? Al-Shabaab is a Somali group that the United States designated as a foreign terrorist organization in March 2008. It wants to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. The group has been blamed for attacks in Somalia that have killed international aid workers, journalists, civilian leaders and African Union peacekeepers. It has a history of striking abroad, too. Before admitting to the Kenya quarry attack, Al-Shabaab was responsible for the July 2010 suicide bombings in Kampala, Uganda, that killed more than 70 people, including a U.S. citizen, who had gathered at different locations to watch the broadcast of the World Cup Final soccer match. How big is it? The total size of Al-Shabaab is not clear. In 2011, A U.S. official who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information said Al-Shabaab was estimated to control up to 1,000 fighters. A U.N. report identified one insurgent leader who is believed to command ""an estimated force of between 200 and 500 fighters,"" most of them Kenyans. And Al-Shabaab has links to other organizations. In February 2012, the group's leader, Ahmed Abdi Godane, and al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released a video announcing the alliance of the two organizations. How did Al-Shabaab start? Decades of weak government amid grinding poverty have long made Somalia a target for radical Islamist groups. Al-Shabaab's predecessor was al-Ittihad al-Islami (AIAI), which worked to create an Islamist emirate in Somalia. It was, in part, funded by former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. AIAI, which the U.S. State Department designated as a terrorist group, strengthened after the fall in 1991 of Siad Barre's military regime and amid the years of lawlessness that ensued. In 2003, a rift erupted between IAIA's old guard -- who were seeking to establish a new political front -- and its younger members, who were seeking to establish fundamental Islamic rule. (Al-Shabaab means ""the youth."") That strife led the younger members to ally with a group of Sharia courts -- the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) -- that were seeking to impose order over a landscape marked by feuding warlords in the capital city. Working together, the Islamic Courts Union and Al-Shabaab gainied control of Mogadishu in 2006. That sparked fears in neighboring Ethiopia that violence would spill over there, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Those fears -- combined with a request from Somalia's transitional government -- led Ethiopian forces to enter Somalia in December 2006 and to remove the ICU from power. And that move inflamed Al-Shabaab, which attacked Ethiopian forces and gained control of parts of central and southern Somalia, according to a 2011 case study by Rob Wise, who was then with the Counterterrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. What is Al-Shabaab's relationship with neighboring countries? In 2011, after attacks on tourist destinations in northern Kenya blamed on Al-Shabaab, the Kenyan government ordered a cross-border incursion aimed at creating a security buffer zone in southern Somalia. Ethiopian troops have also crossed the border and expelled Al-Shabaab from Baidoa, a strategic town midway between the Ethiopian border and Mogadishu. The group then targeted African Union soldiers and government buildings in the capital in suicide attacks. A suicide bombing in March 2012 killed five people at the presidential palace. Analysts say tension appears to have been growing within Al-Shabaab between Somalis and foreign fighters, several hundred of whom are thought to have entered Somalia in recent years to join the group. How does Al-Shabaab recruit? The group has a sophisticated public relations arm that includes a Twitter account and video production abilities. Al-Shabaab has even made a video is as slickly produced as a reality TV show, complete with a hip-hop jihad voice and a startling message: . ""Mortar by mortar, shell by shell, only going to stop when I send them to hell,"" an unidentified voice raps in English. But Al-Shabaab's enemies -- and alliances -- can shift. Al-Amriki, whose real name is Omar Hammami, said in a video posted online last year that he had had a fallout with Al-Shabaab ""regarding matters of the Sharia and matters of strategy"" and feared for his life. He was reportedly killed in Somalia by Al-Shabaab. CNN was not able to confirm the report. Finding replacements might not be difficult. Sheikh Ahmed Matan, a member of Britain's Somali community, said he knows of hundreds of young Somali men living in the West who returned to Somalia for terrorist training. How is Al-Shabaab funded? The once-ragtag al Qaeda affiliate has grown into an economic powerhouse, raising tens of millions of dollars in cash from schemes that have involved extortion, illegal taxation and other ""fees,"" according to the 2011 United Nations report. The United States believed then that the group was coordinating with al Qaeda groups in Yemen and might have been plotting attacks in the region and abroad. In 2011, it was generating ""between $70 million and $100 million per year, from duties and fees levied at airports and seaports, taxes on goods and services, taxes in kind on domestic produce, 'jihad contributions,' checkpoints and various forms of extortion justified in terms of religious obligation,"" according to the report from the U.N. Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea. How have Somalis been affected? In 2011, the U.N. declared a famine in the southern Somalia regions of Bakool and Lower Shabelle, and Al-Shabaab reversed an earlier pledge to allow aid agencies to provide food in famine-stricken areas. That year, the U.N. Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation said Somalia had the highest mortality rate in the world for children ages 4 and younger. About 258,000 Somalis died in the famine between October 2010 and April 2012, and half the victims were younger than age 5, according to a report from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the USAID-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network. What is the United States doing? The United States has supported U.N.-backed African forces fighting Al-Shabaab and strengthened its counterterrorism efforts against the group. It has also donated millions of dollars in aid. What is the status of Somalia's government today? In September 2012, Somali parliament members selected Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as the new president in a vote that marked a milestone for the nation, which had not had a stable central government since Barre's overthrow 21 years earlier. But that didn't mean Al-Shabaab was calling it quits. In January 2013, French forces attempted to rescue a French intelligence commando held hostage in Somalia by the group. The raid left the soldier dead, another soldier missing and 17 Islamist fighters dead. But there has been political progress in Somalia. In January 2013, for the first time in more than two decades, the United States granted official recognition to the Somali government. CNN's Tim Lister, Barbara Starr, Paula Newton, David McKenzie and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Al-Shabaab is an al-Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia .

"President Barack Obama, flanked by the parents of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl at the White House on Saturday, praised the diplomatic officials and troops who helped secure the release of  the American soldier held captive for nearly five years by militants during the Afghanistan war. Bergdahl was released in exchange for five Guantanamo detainees, officials said. The government of Qatar, which helped broker the release, pledged to ""put in place measures to protect our national security,"" Obama said at the White House Rose Garden. ""While Bowe was gone, he was never forgotten,"" the President said. Bergdahl's mother, Jani, said, ""We will continue to stay strong for Bowe while he recovers."" Bob Bergdahl said he was not sure whether his son still speaks English and spoke at one point in what appeared to be Pashtun. ""I'm your father, Bowe,"" the father said. Members of the White House national security team -- including Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, National Security Adviser Susan Rice and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco -- grew emotional when the parents thanked those who helped secure their son's release. Bergdahl, the only remaining U.S. soldier captured during the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, was recovered by U.S. special operations forces without incident about 10:30 a.m. ET at a ""pick-up"" point in eastern Afghanistan, near the border with Pakistan, a senior Department of Defense official told CNN. There were 18 armed Taliban members present. Once he was on an American helicopter, Bergdahl, 28, used a paper plate to communicate because of the noise. He wrote, ""SF?"" meaning, ""special forces?"" One of the operators sitting with Bergdahl responded loudly: ""Yes, we've been looking for you for a long time,"" according to the official. Bergdahl broke down crying. 'Cannot wait to wrap our arms around our only son' Earlier, the White House said in a statement, ""Today the American people are pleased that we will be able to welcome home Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl."" Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said that he had informed Congress of the decision to transfer five detainees from Guantanamo Bay to Qatar in exchange for Bergdahl, who was the only remaining American soldier captured from conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. After Bergdahl was handed over, a series of secret procedures were set in motion so each side knew the other was living up to the bargain, according to U.S. Defense officials. Qatari officials were already at Guantanamo and took custody of the detainees. They assured the Taliban that the detainees would be flown to Qatar. The Afghan Taliban issued a statement on its website in Arabic and Pashto announcing with ""great happiness and joy"" the exchange of Bergdahl for five of its imprisoned senior leaders. It said, ""The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan was and has been for a long time attempting to free all the imprisoned Afghan prisoners inside and outside the country."" ""Sgt. Bergdahl is now under the care of the U.S. military after being handed over by his captors in Afghanistan,"" Hagel said. ""We will give him all the support he needs to help him recover from this ordeal, and we are grateful that he will soon be reunited with his family."" Bergdahl's parents happened to still be in Washington, having visited for Memorial Day. They said in an earlier statement: ""We were so joyful and relieved when President (Barack) Obama called us today to give us the news that Bowe is finally coming home! We cannot wait to wrap our arms around our only son. We want to thank Bowe's many supporters in Idaho, around the nation and around the world. We thank the Amir of Qatar for his efforts.  And of course, we want to take this opportunity to thank all those in the many U.S. Government agencies who never gave up. Today, we are ecstatic!"" Secretary of State John Kerry said the ""cost of years of captivity to Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl and his family is immeasurable."" 'Appropriate assurances' over five detainees . In exchange for Bergdahl's release, five detainees at Guantanamo Bay will be released to Qatar, authorities said. The United States has ""appropriate assurances"" that Qatar will be able to secure the detainees there, where they are under a travel ban for a year. A U.S. Air Force aircraft carrying the detainees left the U.S. Navy base in Cuba on Saturday afternoon, a senior Defense official told CNN. Bergdahl was first transferred to Bagram Airfield, the main U.S. base in Afghanistan, for medical evaluation. ""His health is our number one priority at this time,"" a senior U.S. defense official said. Saturday night, Bergdahl was en route from Bagram to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, a senior defense official told reporters traveling with Hagel. His ""reintegration process"" will include ""time for him to tell his story, decompress, and to reconnect with his family through telephone calls and video conferences. At this time we believe that he will physically reunite with his family in Texas,"" the official said. Hagel said the United States ""coordinated closely with Qatar to ensure that security measures are in place and the national security of the United States will not be compromised."" The United States believes Bergdahl had been held for the bulk of his captivity in Pakistan, the official said. It was unclear when he was moved to Afghanistan. The U.S. government acknowledged in May 2012 that it was engaged in talks with the Taliban to free Bergdahl. Saturday's transfer was brokered through the local Qatari government, the official said, after talks that began about a week ago. U.S. officials had said this year that one route to getting Bergdahl back was through Qatari officials, who had been talking to the Taliban. But Bergdahl was believed to be held by operatives from the Haqqani network, an insurgent force affiliated with the Taliban and al Qaeda, and it was not clear whether Haqqani operatives would abide by any agreement among the United States, Qatar and the Taliban. An Afghan Taliban commander, not authorized to speak to the media, confirmed to CNN that Bergdahl was captured by the Afghan Taliban with links to the Haqqani network in Pakistan. Over the years, the captive was transferred back and forth between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Bergdahl was deployed to Afghanistan in May 2009. He was 23 when he was captured by the Taliban after finishing a guard shift at a combat outpost on June 30, 2009, in Paktika province. Fast Facts: Bowe Bergdahl . In July of that year, a U.S. military official said the soldier was being held by the clan of warlord Siraj Haqqani. Critics question the negotiations . The United States has long declared that it won't negotiate with groups linked to terrorists, but analysts have said the United States has effectively maneuvered around the edges of that declaration over the years. ""As the administration has repeatedly affirmed, we will not transfer any detainee from Guantanamo unless the threat the detainee may pose to the United States can be sufficiently mitigated and only when consistent with our humane treatment policy,"" a senior administration official told CNN, adding that the detainees will be ""subject to restrictions on their movement and activities."" Arizona Sen. John McCain,  a former POW, in a statement called the released detainees ""hardened terrorists who have the blood of Americans and countless Afghans on their hands."" ""I am eager to learn what precise steps are being taken to ensure that these vicious and violent Taliban extremists never return to the fight against the United States and our partners or engage in any activities that can threaten the prospects for peace and security in Afghanistan,"" he said. ""The American people, and our Afghan partners, deserve nothing less."" A senior administration official told CNN, ""With regard to whether or not we're negotiating with terrorists: Sergeant Bergdahl is a member of the military who was detained during the course of an armed conflict. The transfer of these individuals is not a concession -- it is fully in line with the President's goal of closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay."" The Taliban had long demanded the release of five detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. But U.S. officials said that releasing them would be difficult because Congress would have to be notified in advance, and lawmakers have previously resisted releasing them. NATO leaders signed off last week on Obama's exit strategy from Afghanistan that calls for an end to combat operations next year and the withdrawal of the U.S.-led international military force by the end of 2014. Bergdahl, of Wood River Valley, Idaho, appeared in diminished health in a video that the U.S. military obtained in January. His family also received a letter from him last year via the Red Cross.","Obama, parents thank those who arranged for release .

"(RollingStone.com) -- It was surprising enough to see Bruce Springsteen performing Willow Smith's ""Whip My Hair"" with Jimmy Fallon (as Neil Young) earlier this week -- let alone doing it as his bearded 1970s self. Fallon tells Rolling Stone how it all came together. ""We have a great writer, Mike Dicenzo,"" Fallon says. ""It was his idea to do the Neil Young [parody], and 'Fresh Prince of Bel-Air' and 'Pants on the Ground.' We were tryin' to think of [another one], and he was like, 'Dude, I think I found the song: we should do 'Whip My Hair' by Willow Smith.' And I listened to the song and went, 'Oh my God, it could be great.' ""We were just gonna do that as Neil, but in the meantime, we'd been talking to [Springsteen manager] Jon Landau. I know he'd loved the [""Glee""/""Born to Run""] Emmy opening. They called us up and said, 'Bruce wants to come on and do a couple songs off the box set and the new record.' I was like, 'Oh my God -- would he be up for a bit?' We didn't hear back for a couple days, but they said, 'Yeah, he'd be open to it -- he's not really into that stuff, but if you wanna pitch him something.' ""So we did a scratch track in my office, sent it to Bruce -- and he loved it. He was like, 'I'm in!' And then Jon Landau -- this is the craziest call -- says, 'I have an idea: If Jimmy's being Neil from the '70s, maybe Bruce should be Bruce from the '70s? We'll get a beard ...' And I was like, 'What?' So he says, 'Here's his number, give him a call and talk about it.' "" Exclusive listen: Fifteen Bruce Springsteen songs . Fast-forward to Bruce and Jimmy in the makeup room. ""He brought his actual sunglasses from the ""Born to Run"" times, and he goes, 'I got the glasses, I just need a floppy hat.' We got him one, and we taped this beard on him, and he goes, 'Wow, that's it right there.' And I go, 'Do you want to put the wig on?' And he's laughing, 'What are you trying to do to me?!' There was no one else in the room. I go, 'Let me shut the door. It's just me and you. Just put the wig on, and we see if it looks good.' He was so sad! So I put a wig on Bruce Springsteen, and then he put the hat over the wig and looked in the mirror, and he was just like, 'Whoa.' And that was it. He looked exactly like he looked in 1970. It was spooky. ""So then we went to show Jon what we did, and I think he started [tearing] up a little bit, to be honest. He was just, like, 'Gosh, Bruce, you look like when we first started working together. That's crazy!' Like, when would he ever do [something like] this? You don't dress up as yourself at home. It was a really cool moment. Check out the exclusive Rolling Stone Q&A with Springsteen . ""Right before he was about to come out I heard applause backstage in the hallway -- I was like, 'What was that?' And said, 'He just walked into everyone from his camp.' No one had seen him yet, just Jon, and people freaked out. They were like, 'Oh my God, Bruce, you look so young.' Everyone was getting nostalgic. ""One of my friends who was at the show was like, 'I'm the biggest Bruce fan. There's no way he would do that!' It was just so fun. He just went for it and nailed it, and all I kept saying in my head was, 'Keep a straight face ... keep straight face.' ""I've listened to it probably 10 times already.""

"On Wednesday, President Obama nominated Caroline Kennedy to be U.S. ambassador to Japan. It turns out the Kennedy family has an important legacy in U.S.-Japan relations. Kennedy's father and uncle, John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy, played important roles in transforming a troubled U.S.-Japan military alliance into the robust relationship the two countries enjoy today. In the 1950s, Americans were often contemptuous and distrustful toward Japan, which had very recently been a bitter enemy in World War II. The Japanese resented the post-war U.S. occupation, resented the loss of territory (such as Okinawa) to the United States, and feared that the Cold War hostilities between the United States and the Soviet Union would drag Japan into war. In 1960, Japanese resentment boiled over in massive protests against renewal of the U.S.-Japan alliance. As crowds filled Tokyo's streets and a political crisis rocked the Japanese parliament, the movement to distance Japan from the United States gained momentum. President-elect Kennedy feared the loss of a vital Cold War ally. Partnering with similarly worried leaders on the Japan side, he decided to take action. In the wake of Richard Nixon's dramatic foreign policy victories in Latin America in 1958 when Nixon was vice president, and after the Bay of Pigs failure in 1961, President Kennedy also knew he needed a diplomatic victory as he moved toward his re-election campaign. So, he envisioned a visit to Japan, the first by a sitting U.S. president. Kennedy planned a dramatic reunion and affirmation of friendship between the crew of PT-109 (Kennedy's storied boat that sank in the South Pacific in World War II), and the crew of Amagiri (the Japanese destroyer that sank it). To advance the historic visit, the president sent his brother and a delegation to Tokyo in 1962. Sadly, the reunion of the two crews was never to occur; Kennedy's assassination the next year meant that a U.S. president would not visit Japan until Gerald Ford's trip in 1974. Although John F. Kennedy never made the trip, it turns out that his brother's visit had an important effect on the U.S.-Japan relationship. Kennedy and his wife, Ethel, met with Japanese people from all walks of life: students, teachers, farmers, labor leaders. ""The Kennedys had such a disarming way; they really charmed people, and were so genuine,"" recalled Susie Wilson, a journalist who was part of the delegation. The legacy of the RFK visit also extended far beyond that week. To host the Kennedys, a group of pro-American business and political leaders on the Japan side formed what they called the ""RK Committee."" Out of it grew several institutions, exchange programs, dialogues -- which over time helped knit together the two societies. Among them were Cabinet-level exchanges on the economy, scientific cooperation, culture and education. These institutions helped transform a narrow alliance into a deep and multifaceted relationship that today, in both countries, enjoys widespread popular support. It is this alliance that Caroline Kennedy must manage. Though like-minded, deeply committed partners, the United States and Japan today face many challenges that could strain their relationship. The United States seeks Japanese agreement to its ambitious free-trade regime -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. Yet a thicket of Japanese subsidies, trade barriers, and domestic political and economic interests hold Tokyo back. The issue of relocating a U.S. military base that is in Okinawa remains unresolved, and -- most worryingly --Japan's diplomatic crises with China over disputed China Sea islands (known in China as Diaoyu, in Japan as Senkaku) have elevated fears in Washington. Critics of Caroline Kennedy's nomination say she lacks the political or regional chops needed by an ambassador at such an important post. Of course, an effective ambassador needs to know how to navigate the Washington policy-making process, a skill that one can develop through years of experience. On the Japan side, a good ambassador must be able to relate well to the people of the host country, and having deep area expertise facilitates this. But Caroline Kennedy actually looks pretty good on both counts. On the U.S. side, a long political resume -- such as that of former U.S. ambassadors to Japan Walter Mondale, Thomas Foley, or Mike Mansfield -- is one route toward the influence needed to shape U.S. policy. But Caroline Kennedy has that most precious policy-making asset of all: the president's ear. By virtue of her vital 2008 endorsement of candidate Obama (widely interpreted as pivotal in his primary battle against Hillary Clinton), and by virtue of her subsequent work in key posts in his campaign, Kennedy has developed a close relationship with the president that will give her a powerful voice. Tokyo is praising the nomination. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs welcomed it as ""reflecting the great importance the Obama administration attaches to the Japan-U.S. alliance."" Japanese diplomats have commented that because the Kennedy name carries tremendous cachet there, Kennedy's nomination will excite the people and create interest in the U.S. Embassy. This, they say, is a good thing for U.S.-Japan relations. To some degree, of course, the Japanese are excited by the nomination because of the star power of Camelot. But some of the excitement surely stems from their memory and appreciation of the important contributions of the Kennedy family to the U.S.-Japan relationship, an important legacy from which the alliance continues to benefit, and which Caroline Kennedy is now tasked to continue.","Jennifer Lind: Obama nominated Caroline Kennedy to be U.S.  ambassador to Japan .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt, including its capital Cairo, teetered on the edge early Thursday as clashes persisted following the bloodiest day since the revolution two years ago that was envisioned to bring peace and democracy to Egypt -- but has not. The violence Wednesday pitted Egypt's military and current government against backers of deposed President Mohamed Morsy, though others also were caught in the fray. At least 278 people were killed, including 235 civilians, state TV reported, citing an Egyptian emergency official. Interim Interior Minister Gen. Mohammed Ibrahim said that an additional 43 police officers died. ""It's an open war,"" said a protester who escaped one of two Cairo camps that were raided. The intensity and violence lingered into Thursday morning, when state TV reported Morsy backers were attacking police stations, hospitals and government buildings despite a government-mandated curfew. More Egyptian troops were being deployed at entrances to Cairo and Giza, with the unrest prompting the closure Thursday of banks and the nation's stock market. The 2011 revolution that led to the ouster of Hosni Mubarak, who'd kept a firm grip on power for 30 years, was followed by Egypt's first democratic elections. Morsy -- a leader of the Islamist group the Muslim Brotherhood -- won the presidency in that 2012 vote, but was forced out by the military last month. Morsy hasn't been seen since he was taken into custody. Yet his supporters have very public in voicing their opinions, massing on the streets of Cairo and elsewhere to slam military leaders and demand Morsy's return to the presidency. Egypt's new government refused to back down, criticizing elements of the protest movement and specifically ordering them to leave two spots where they'd been gathering in Cairo for six weeks, or else they'd force them out. On Wednesday, they did. Bloody 'war zone' as security forces clear Cairo square . The story of what exactly transpired -- who attacked whom, who opened fire, who was to blame -- varied 180 degrees depending on where one stood in the debate over Egypt's past, present and future. On the one side, there were Morsy supporters, one of whom accused government forces of waging a ""full-on assault"" on what they said had been, to-date, peaceful demonstrations. On the other, there were those like Ibrahim, who professed to being ""surprised"" by the ""Muslim Brotherhood's (decision) to attack the security forces."" What couldn't be mistaken was the chaos, the bloodshed and the sense -- even with Prime Minister Hazem Elbeblawi's pledge ""we hopefully will rebuild our nation"" -- that the already volatile situation in Egypt could be getting worse. ""I think what we're seeing right now is just the beginning of what is promising to be a very, very long and bloody battle as the interim government and the security forces try to regain control of the streets,"" CNN's Arwa Damon reported from Cairo. Diplomats condemn violence, calling it 'deplorable' The government on Wednesday, according to state TV, issued a month-long state of emergency. This a loaded term in Egypt, given that Mubarak long ruled under such a decree that barred unauthorized assembly, restricted freedom of speech and let police jail people indefinitely. The prime minister said the government felt compelled to act to ensure stability, praising security forces for their ""calm"" and claiming some activists had intent to undermine the government. ""We are here to build a democracy based on justice,"" Elbeblawi said. ""... We have to reason and use common sense. We are all part of this nation."" Yet not everyone expressed faith in his government. Mohammed ElBaradei -- a secular leader who was one of Morsy's biggest critics before joining the government that replaced him -- submitted his resignation Wednesday as vice president of foreign affairs, saying he didn't agree with decisions being carried out by the ruling government and ""cannot be responsible for a single (drop of) blood."" His decision spurred scorn from some former allies, with youth groups and June 30th coalition members questioning his stepping down ""at this critical and historic phase,"" according to state-run EGYNews. Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, sharply criticized ""ongoing violence"" by Brotherhood supporters against Coptic Christian churches in the country. He also chastised the government's crackdown on the Islamist group. ""Didn't have to happen,"" Roth tweeted. ""MB had right to protest. No need for massive lethal force."" World urges Egypt to show restraint, protect civilians . The European Union's top diplomat, Catherine Ashton, urged ""security forces to exercise utmost restraint and ... the interim government to end the state of emergency as soon as possible, to allow the resumption of normal life."" In light of the ongoing violence, the United States is considering canceling next month's planned biennial military training exercise with Egyptian forces, an official in President Barack Obama's administration said. Pressing Egypt's government ""to respect basic human rights,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said that Wednesday's ""deplorable"" events ""run counter to Egyptian aspirations for peace, inclusion and genuine democracy."" ""The path toward violence leads only to greater instability, economic disaster and suffering,"" he said. 'They're prepared to die' For weeks, the two makeshift Cairo protest camps had become cities unto themselves -- with people sleeping in tents, vendors hawking everything from haircuts to masks, and children playing in inflatable castles and splashing in kiddie pools. At dawn on Wednesday, they came under siege. Security forces rushed in, bulldozing tents and escorting away hundreds. Some mothers and fathers managed to whisk away their children, gas masks on their faces. Within three hours, the smaller camp -- Nahda, near Cairo University -- was clear, except for shreds of torn-down tents that remained. But the larger protest, near the Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque in eastern Cairo, proved trickier. Facing heavy resistance, the military called in special forces. Chaos ensued. Along with smoke, bursts of rapid gunfire filled the air, as did people's wails. Many protesters refused to leave, even in the face of bulldozers and surrounded by the injured and dead. ""They said they're prepared to die,"" CNN's Reza Sayah reported. State TV reported that snipers from the Muslim Brotherhood -- Morsy's party -- exchanged gunfire with Egyptian security forces near a university building. The dead included cameraman Mick Deane, who'd worked for UK-based news channel Sky News for 15 years and for CNN before that. Habiba Abdel Aziz of Gulf News, who was in Egypt on her own time having celebrated the Eid holiday, also died, editor-at-large Francis Matthew told CNN. And Reuters photojournalist Asmaa Waguih was shot and wounded, the news agency told CNN. She was being treated in a hospital. 'Walking on the blood of the victims' Ibrahim, the interim interior minister, claimed armed protesters were the aggressors -- including trying to storm police stations, the Ministry of Finance building and other targets in Cairo. The fighting wasn't limited to the capital. Morsy backers reportedly besieged churches in Sohag, setting fire to Saint George's Church, a tour bus and a police car, EGYNews said. Naguib Sawiris, an Egyptian billionaire who helped found the anti-Morsy Free Egyptian Party, said his party had video of Muslim Brotherhood members ""shooting machine guns on civilians, on police. So anyone who wants to call this a peaceful demonstration would be wrong."" But Ahmed Mustafa, a Muslim Brotherhood spokesman, told CNN that Sawiris was trying to misrepresent video of masked people with weapons. Besides claiming they'd been shot at, the Muslim Brotherhood also accused police of throwing Molotov cocktails at makeshift clinics. Security forces pushed doctors out of one hospital at gunpoint, a witness said, and a CNN crew at one point was ""literally walking on the blood of the victims."" Yet Ibrahim said government forces had done what they could to limit casualties, with his ministry insisting, ""Egyptian security forces are committed to the utmost self-restraint in dealing with the protesters."" Divisions rife, future uncertain in Egypt . Rather than uniting Egypt after Mubarak's fall, divisions remained rife -- and, in some ways, intensified -- during Morsy's time as president. Critics accused him of being authoritarian, trying to force the Brotherhood's Islamic agenda, not being inclusive and failing to deliver freedom and justice. 'Nail in coffin' for Arab Spring? The military coup to dismiss him, they said, was necessary since Morsy didn't fairly represent all Egyptians. So, too, were the efforts to force his supporters off the streets. ""We believe in human rights,"" said Shehab Wagih, a spokesman for the Free Egyptian Party speaking in favor of the military. ""But at the same time, we cannot accept the idea of having a state inside a state."" Morsy's backers, meanwhile, accuse the military -- and the government it appointed -- of undermining the people's will, as expressed at the polls. The deposed president wasn't given a fair chance, they say, and his supporters have been unfairly targeted for expressing their opinion. Talking Wednesday on CNN, Abdul Mawgoud Dardery of the pro-Morsy Anti-Coup National Alliance blamed ""corrupt elements"" in the Egyptian army for the bloodshed, calling their actions a ""crime against humanity"" and ""state terrorism.""

"U.S. troops arrived in Turkey on Friday to man Patriot missile defense batteries near the Syrian border, Turkish state media said. The move was made after Syria launched Scud missiles at cities near the Turkish border. In response, the U.S., Germany and the Netherlands have deployed Patriot air defense missiles to the border region to intercept any Syrian ballistic missiles. U.S. officials: Syria using more accurate, Iranian-made missiles . The missiles and troops are under the control of NATO, but the missiles are to be operated by U.S. forces. A group of 27 U.S. troops landed in Gaziantep, Turkey, where they will survey the Patriot deployment, Turkish state news agency Anadolu said. U.S. officials did not release any information about the troops' arrival, but had said last month that forces would be deployed to Turkey. ""We've made very clear to them that we're going to protect countries in this region,""  Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said last month. ""We have to act to do what we have to do to make sure that we defend ourselves and make sure that Turkey can defend itself."" The fight for a helicopter airport . Meanwhile, Free Syrian Army fighters tried Friday for the third consecutive day to wrest control of a helicopter base from government forces. If successful, the assault on Taftanaz Air Base in northern Syria would shut President Bashar al-Assad's military helicopter pads and diminish his ability to launch airstrikes in the region. Opposition and government sources reported that the extremist Nusra Front, which the United States has designated as a terrorist group, was taking part in the assault on the airport. Al-Assad has exacted retribution on the nearby city of Binnish, where amateur video posted on the Internet shows dozens of smoke plumes marking where ordnance has struck.

"OXFORD, Mississippi (CNN)  -- A national poll of people who watched the first presidential debate suggests that Barack Obama came out on top, but there was overwhelming agreement that both Obama and John McCain would be able to handle the job of president if elected. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey is not a measurement of the views of all Americans, since only people who watched the debate were questioned and the audience included more Democrats than Republicans. Fifty-one percent of those polled thought Obama did the better job in Friday night's debate, while 38 percent said John McCain did better. Men were nearly evenly split between the two candidates, with 46 percent giving the win to McCain and 43 percent to Obama. But women voters tended to give Obama higher marks, with 59 percent calling him the night's winner, while just 31 percent said McCain won. ""It can be reasonably concluded, especially after accounting for the slight Democratic bias in the survey, that we witnessed a tie in Mississippi tonight,"" CNN Senior Political Researcher Alan Silverleib said. ""But given the direction of the campaign over the last couple of weeks, a tie translates to a win for Obama."" Watch entire debate:  Part 1 » |  Part 2 » |  Part 3 » . McCain apparently failed to get the ""game changer"" he needed to reverse his deficit in the polls, Silverleib said. Grade the candidates' performances in the debate . Both candidates appeared to exceed expectations. McCain did better than expected in the minds of 60 percent, while 57 percent said Obama did a better job in the debate than they expected. Twenty percent said both candidates did worse than expected. iReport.com: Who do you think won the debate? More than two-thirds of debate watchers agreed that both McCain and Obama would be able to handle the job of president if elected. National security has been an issue where McCain has held an advantage, but his edge over Obama -- 49 percent to 45 percent -- on the question of which candidate would best handle terrorism is within the poll's 4.5 percent margin of error.  Watch candidates discuss likelihood of another 9/11 » . The economy, which has been Obama's terrain this cycle, dominated the first half of the debate. Debate watchers gave him a 21 percentage point edge -- 58 to 37 percent -- on the question of which candidate would do a better job handling the economy. By a similar margin, those polled said Obama would be better able to deal with the current financial crisis facing the nation.  Watch McCain, Obama discuss the economy » . The real impact of the debate may not be apparent right away. ""The real test will come in a few days when we see whether support for Obama or McCain changes in polls involving all voters, not just debate watchers,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""In post-debate polls after the first faceoff in 2004, John Kerry got virtually the same numbers as Obama did tonight. Polls released a few days later showed Kerry gaining five points in the horse race."" Good post-debate poll numbers don't always spell success in the horse race, he said. ""Kerry also won the third debate in 2004 with the same numbers that Obama got in tonight's poll, but his support dropped five points after that event,"" Holland said. Poll interviews were conducted with 524 adult Americans who watched the debate and were conducted by telephone on September 26. All interviews were done after the end of the debate. The margin of error for the survey is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. The results may be favoring Obama simply because more Democrats than Republicans tuned in to the debate. Of the debate-watchers questioned in this poll, 41 percent of the respondents identified themselves as Democrats, 27 percent as Republicans and 30 percent as independents. The best estimate of the number of Democrats in the voting age population as a whole indicates that the sample is roughly 5 to 7 percentage points more Democratic than the population as a whole.

"By any standard, the killings are grisly. With the discovery of the body of an 87-year-old Georgia woman whose disappearance came to light after her husband's decapitated body was found in their waterfront home, authorities not only want to know who did it, but also why. Shirley Dermond's body was found in Lake Oconee, south of Athens, Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills told reporters Friday. ""We now, unfortunately, know that Shirley Dermond was murdered,"" Sills said. Sills declined to discuss the condition of the body other than to say, ""the head was not removed or anything like that."" Authorities were alerted Friday by two fishermen who spotted what they believed to be a body in the lake, some five or six miles from the couple's home. The discovery adds an element to the investigation -- the possibility that a boat was a mode of transportation in the killing, Sills said. ""This jumps us about two jumps up on the checkerboard, shall we say,"" he said. Dermond's family is in shock with the news of the discovery of her body, said the Rev. David Key of Lake Oconee Community Church. ""We haven't even had a funeral for Russell because their kids wanted to wait. Now that we know about Shirley, we will start planning the funeral services for both."" From the beginning, investigators treated Dermond's disappearance as an abduction. Her purse, cell phone and car were all at the couple's million-dollar waterfront home on Lake Oconee where her husband's headless body was found. Investigators believe she was taken from her home after her husband, 88-year-old Russell Dermond, was decapitated sometime between May 2 and May 4. Investigators continue to search for his head, and they plan to look in the same area of the lake where Dermond's body was found, Sill said. ""Obviously, the head of Mr. Dermond will be quite difficult to locate."" Russell Dermond's body was discovered in the couple's garage after friends, who hadn't heard from the couple in days, went to their home. The FBI put up more than 100 billboards in its search for the missing woman, and it offered a reward of up to $20,000 for information to her location or the arrest of the person responsible for her disappearance. ""The mindset of the individual that did this was a homicidal individual that doesn't deserve to breathe the air on this Earth,"" Sills said. In the days after Dermond's disappearance, authorities searched Lake Oconee in the vicinity of the couple's home -- turning up only a lawn chair and a Christmas tree -- and sent cadaver dogs into the nearby woods, to no avail. Authorities have also spoken to neighbors, family and friends. So far, the investigation has turned up little to shed light on the crimes. Investigators aren't aware of any enemies the couple had made, or any reason someone would target them, Sills said.","Investigators now believe a boat may have been used, the sheriff says .

"Caroline Kennedy on Tuesday stepped before an emperor and into a new global limelight, along a path paved by her father. Arriving at Tokyo's Imperial Palace in a maroon horse-drawn carriage, the 55-year-old presented Emperor Akihito with her credentials to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to Japan. Along the route into the palace's leafy grounds, onlookers waited to catch a glimpse of her in the late autumn sunshine. Some waved small Japanese and U.S. flags. ""This appointment has a special significance as we commemorate the 50th anniversary of my father's presidency,"" she told a U.S. Senate committee in September before being confirmed for the post. Her father, President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated November 22, 1963 -- 50 years ago this week. ""I am conscious of my responsibility to uphold the ideals he represented -- a deep commitment to public service, a more just America and a more peaceful world,"" Caroline Kennedy said. For all the pomp of Tuesday's event, the significance of Caroline Kennedy's arrival as a historic marker runs deep. John F. Kennedy battled against Japan in World War II. In fact, he said Japan's success against him was what made him a hero.  ""It was involuntary,"" he once said. ""They sank my boat."" His encounter with a Japanese destroyer on the night of August 1, 1943, ""may be the most famous small-craft engagement in naval history,"" the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum says. Continuing the legacy . Later, he ""hoped to be the first sitting President to make a state visit to Japan,"" Caroline Kennedy told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. John F. Kennedy planned to reunite the crew of his boat, the PT-109, with the crew of the Amagiri that sank it, says Jennifer Lind, government professor at Dartmouth College. It was an effort to calm protests in Japan against renewal of the U.S.-Japan alliance, Lind wrote in a column for CNN.com. ""If confirmed as ambassador, I would be humbled to carry forward his legacy in a small way and represent the powerful bonds that unite our two democratic societies,"" Caroline Kennedy told the Senate committee. At a state dinner in the new ambassador's honor last week, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said, ""The daughter of a heroic lieutenant in World War II will be the first woman in the next generation after the war to represent our country in a relationship that symbolizes so much more than just a normal diplomatic relationship. This is a symbol of reconciliation, a symbol of possibilities, a symbol of people who know how to put the past behind them and look to the future and build a future together. ""That is, in today's world, both remarkable and beautiful."" Debate over credentials . Just how well she'll serve as ambassador, however, is under debate in Washington, in diplomatic circles, and in the media. A lawyer and philanthropist with degrees from Harvard and Columbia, Kennedy has worked to advance New York City schools.  A stalwart supporter of President Obama, she launched a failed effort to replace Hillary Clinton in the Senate after Clinton became Obama's secretary of state. Fast Facts: Caroline Kennedy . ""A strong, politically savvy woman is just what Japan and the United States need to strengthen relations on both sides of the Pacific,"" Shihoko Goto of the Woodrow Wilson International Center wrote in a column for CNN.com. Caroline Kennedy ""may or may not exactly fit that bill,"" Goto wrote. ""With any luck, though, she could leverage her appointment as Washington's top envoy to Tokyo to heighten awareness of just how seriously both sides need to take the issue of female leadership."" ""Kennedy's biggest personal challenge would be to come out of her father's shadow and establish herself as a top diplomat in her own right,"" Goto added. Opinion: How Caroline Kennedy could make a difference in Japan . 'A political neophyte' Some other analysts are far less charitable. In two separate posts both titled ""Amateur hour"" -- one from April, the other September -- writers at foreignpolicy.com took aim at her credentials or lack thereof. ""She doesn't speak Japanese and has no academic or professional background in foreign affairs,"" Stephen Walt wrote.  ""Compared with some other former U.S. ambassadors to Japan (e.g., Mike Mansfield, Walter Mondale, Michael Armacost, or Tom Foley), she's a political neophyte."" ""She will do fine until her first misstep on policy,"" David Leheny and Richard Samuels wrote.  ""Then, if history is any guide, the Japanese public will turn on her (and by proxy, the U.S. government). They will wonder -- publicly and loudly -- why Americans take Japan for granted and how Washington could dispatch such a neophyte to such a sensitive post."" Dallas comes to terms with what happened to JFK . Personal fortune . Caroline Kennedy has acknowledged that her personal wealth puts her at risk for potential conflicts, CNNMoney has reported. ""I understand that a heightened prospect of a conflict of interest could exist as to the companies that maintain a presence in Japan, because they may be more likely than other companies to seek official assistance from or make other contact with the embassy,"" she wrote in a letter to the Office of Government Ethics.  Her net worth is as high as $280 million, according to CNNMoney's analysis. In speaking before the Senate committee, however, Caroline Kennedy sought to dispel any suggestions that she'd be unprepared to handle the assignment. She  fielded questions about the Trans Pacific Partnership, Tokyo's territorial dispute with Beijing in the East China Sea and military cooperation. She vowed to work with Congress ""to advance the interests of the United States, protect the safety of our citizens, and strengthen the bilateral relationship for the benefit of both our countries.""

"A five-month-old dog that fell into hot tar spilled around a construction site in northern India was eventually saved by a four-hour rescue operation. Claire Abrams from the animal welfare group, Animal Aid Unlimited, says staff from the charity rushed to the scene in the city of Udaipur, Rajasthan, after receiving a phone call from a passerby. They found the dog lying motionless, his hardened body stuck to the ground: ""There was no way he could have come out of his own, without any intervention,"" Abrams said. The rescuers spent hours massaging a large amount of vegetable oil into his body to loosen the tar, avoiding the use of kerosene because of its harsh effects on skin. After about four hours, the crew were able to pull the dog out of the sticky liquid, before taking him to the animal shelter. It took several days to clear his body of the tar. On his first night of arrival at the shelter, Abrams says: ""He was petrified and breathing heavily."" The dog, now affectionately known as ""Tar Baby"", has recovered successfully and has also been vaccinated. Based in Udaipur, Animal Aid Unlimited is home to a number of dogs, cows, donkeys and pigs. The charity provides emergency assistance and shelter to street animals, responding to calls made to their dedicated helpline.","A 5-month-old dog fell into hot tar at a construction site in northern India .

"(CNN) -- A gunman opened fire inside a busy shopping center near the Finnish capital of Helsinki Thursday, leaving four people dead, police said. Before the shooting spree at the shopping center, Ibrahim Shkupolli, 43, had killed his ex-girlfriend, police said. He later turned the gun on himself at his home. Three men and one woman were killed at the Sello shopping center in Espoo, just west of Helsinki, police said. Some were employees of a grocery store at the mall, police said. A fifth victim, also an employee of the grocery store and apparently the suspect's ex-girlfriend, was found later at an apartment in Espoo, police said. Police told a news conference hours after the shootings that they found a sixth victim, who they believed to be the shooter. Shkupolli had lived in Finland ""for some time,"" police said, but would not divulge his nationality. iReport: Are you there? Send your photos and videos . Espoo is the headquarters for mobile phone giant Nokia and the hometown of Formula 1 racing driver Kimi Raikkonen. The Sello shopping center, one of Finland's largest, was busy with shoppers when the shootings began at 10:08 a.m. (3:08 a.m.) ""People saw a gunman, calm, walking out of the grocery store after shooting,"" said Mika Pettersson, editor-in-chief of Finnish news agency STT. ""People first thought it was fireworks that had been exploding, but after they realized what had happened, there was a panic."" State-owned Finnish broadcaster YLE said the gunman used a 9mm handgun. Restaurant manager Naresh Gaonkar, who runs the Intialainen Ravintola Curry Palace across the street from the mall, told CNN there were police helicopters overhead and many police cars driving past with armed officers after the shootings. Trains going through Espoo were stopped, Gaonkar said. Pauli Poutanen, a reporter with CNN affiliate MTV3, reported employees of the grocery store where the attack happened were evacuated so quickly that they didn't have time to put on their winter weather gear. They were waiting outside in T-shirts in temperatures as low as -10 degrees Celsius, or 14 degrees Fahrenheit, he said. Gaonkar said many of them were inside his restaurant to stay warm. Other lone gunmen have carried out two recent high-profile shootings in Finland. In September 2008, student Matti Juhani Saari, 22, killed 10 people before shooting himself in the head at Seinajoki University of Applied Sciences in Kauhajoki, Finland. Saari, who had been armed with a semi-automatic pistol and Molotov cocktails, posted YouTube videos of himself firing weapons before embarking on the massacre. Pekka-Eric Auvinen, 18, killed seven fellow students and the principal at Jokela High School in Tuusula in November 2007 before shooting himself in the head. Auvinen posted a YouTube video titled ""Jokela High School Massacre"" before the killing spree. In it he warned that he planned to ""eliminate all who I see unfit."" Brandishing a shotgun, the teenager was seen in the video wearing a T-shirt proclaiming ""Humanity is Overrated.""

"(CNN) -- Olympic hero Michael Phelps was suspended from competitive swimming for three months on Thursday -- just hours after one of his sponsors announced it would not renew his contract after a photo surfaced of him smoking from a bong. Michael Phelps admitted ""regrettable behavior"" after a  photo of him smoking from a bong was published. USA Swimming, the nation's governing body for competitive swimming, said it was withdrawing financial support for Phelps and barring him from competition during the period of his ""reprimand."" ""This is not a situation where any anti-doping rule was violated, but we decided to send a strong message to Michael because he disappointed so many people, particularly the hundreds of thousands of USA Swimming-member kids who look up to him as a role model and a hero,"" they said in a statement. ""Michael has voluntarily accepted this reprimand and has committed to earn back our trust,"" the statement continued. Earlier Thursday, Kellogg Co. said it will not renew Phelps' advertising contract. ""Michael's most recent behavior is not consistent with the image of Kellogg,"" company spokeswoman Susanne Norwitz said. ""His contract expires at the end of February, and we have made a decision not to extend his contract."" Norwitz said Kellogg's relationship with Phelps began with the company's support of the U.S. Olympic team. Kellogg did not renew its sponsorship of the team when it expired in December, she said. Phelps admitted ""regrettable behavior"" on Sunday after a British newspaper published the photograph. The tabloid News of the World showed Phelps using the bong during what it said was a November party at the University of South Carolina in Columbia. The Richland County, South Carolina, sheriff's office said Tuesday it was investigating whether Phelps smoked marijuana on the school campus, adding it would file criminal charges if it determined he did. Both university police and Columbia, South Carolina, police said they would not pursue charges, according to The State newspaper in Columbia. It was unclear where the party took place, the paper said, or whether it was on campus. On Thursday, before the decisions by USA Swimming and Kellogg were announced, Phelps told CNN affiliate WBAL that the incident was a result of ""bad judgment.""  Watch Phelps' comments to WBAL » . ""I can learn from it and try to make my life better than it has been in the past,"" he told WBAL. ""I think it's hard to really be ready for any of this. But I've actually been able to talk to a lot of people, and lot of people that have been in my shoes in other sports, and I've been able to get their perspective and just talk to them a little bit, and that's been helpful over the last few days,"" Phelps said. In a statement released Sunday, Phelps, who won a record eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, said: ""I engaged in behavior which was regrettable and demonstrated bad judgment."" ""I'm 23 years old, and despite the successes I have had in the pool, I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way, not in a manner that people have come to expect from me,"" he said. ""For this, I am sorry. I promise my fans and the public -- it will not happen again."" iReport.com: Should Phelps have been suspended? The U.S. Olympic Committee also issued a statement that said in part: ""Michael has acknowledged that he made a mistake and apologized for his actions. We are confident that, going forward, Michael will consistently set the kind of example we all expect from a great Olympic champion."" In 2004, Phelps was arrested on charges of driving under the influence in Salisbury, Maryland. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months probation. He also issued an apology after that incident. Phelps is one of 12 Olympic athletes who pledged to ""My Victory,"" an initiative launched last year by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency aimed at keeping competitive sports clean.","USA Swimming suspends Michael Phelps from competition for three months .

"(CNN) -- The same blue food dye found in M&Ms and Gatorade could be used to reduce damage caused by spine injuries, offering a better chance of recovery, according to new research. Rats injected with BBG not only regained their mobility but temporarily turned blue. Researchers at the University of Rochester Medical Center found that when they injected the compound Brilliant Blue G (BBG) into rats suffering spinal cord injuries, the rodents were able to walk again, albeit with a limp. The only side effect was that the treated mice temporarily turned blue. The results of the study, published in the ""Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,"" build on research conducted by the same center five years ago. In August 2004, scientists revealed how Adenosine triphosphate, which is known as ATP and described as the ""energy currency of life,"" surges to the spinal cord soon after injury occurs. Researchers found that the sudden influx of ATP killed off healthy cells, making the initial injury far worse. But when they injected oxidized ATP into the injury, it was found to block the effect of ATP, allowing the injured rats to recover and walk again. ""While we achieved great results when oxidized ATP was injected directly into the spinal cord, this method would not be practical for use with spinal cord-injured patients,"" said lead researcher Maiken Nedergaard, professor of Neurosurgery and director of the Center for Translational Neuromedicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center. ""First, no one wants to put a needle into a spinal cord that has just been severely injured, so we knew we needed to find another way to quickly deliver an agent that would stop ATP from killing healthy motor neurons. Second, the compound we initially used, oxidized ATP, cannot be injected into the bloodstream because of its dangerous side effects."" Back in 2004, Nedergaard's team discovered that the spinal cord was rich in a molecule called P2X7, which is also known as ""the death receptor"" for its ability to allow ATP to latch onto motor neurons and send the signals which eventually kill them. Nedergaard knew that BBG could thwart the function of P2X7, and its similarity to a blue food dye approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1982 gave her the confidence to test it intravenously. It worked. The rats given BBG immediately after their injury could walk again with a limp. Those that didn't receive a dose never regained their mobility. Nedergaard told CNN that there is currently no standard treatment for patients with spinal injury when they reach the hospital emergency room. ""Right now we only treat 15 percent of the patients we receive with steroids and many hospitals question if that even works for that 15 percent; it's a very moderate benefit to only a subset of patients. So right now 85 percent of patients are untreated,"" she said. Nedergaard said the research team isn't claiming that BBG can cure spinal injuries, instead that it offers a potential improvement in patients' condition. ""Even a moderate improvement in functional performance of the patient is a big, big event for these patients,"" she said. ""They can control their bladder. If they can just take small steps instead of sitting in a wheelchair all the time, it's a tremendous benefit for these patients,"" she added. The dose must be administered immediately after the injury, before additional tissue dies as a result of the initial injury. Researchers are currently pulling together an application to be lodged with the FDA to stage the first clinical trials of BBG on human patients. ""Our hope is that this work will lead to a practical, safe agent that can be given to patients shortly after injury, for the purpose of decreasing the secondary damage that we have to otherwise expect,"" said Steven Goldman, Chair of the University of Rochester Department of Neurology.","Researchers find way to reduce secondary damage caused by spinal injuries .
Compound BBG is similar to blue food dye used in sweets, sports drinks .
Only side effect of intravenous injection was that it turned test rats blue .

"(CNN) -- Apple was slow to act against the booming counterfeit industry in China and other Asian countries, according to cables obtained by WikiLeaks. The technology giant eventually organized a team in March 2008 to curtail the explosion of knockoff iPods and iPhones, according to an electronic memo from the Beijing embassy dated September 2008. Yet, three years after Apple moved to crack down on widespread counterfeiting and put pressure on China, progress has been slow. Gadget piracy isn't a high priority for the Chinese government, the U.S. reports and experts say. Members of Apple's recently formed global security team were recruited from Pfizer after they executed a series of crackdowns on counterfeit Viagra production in Asia, the report says. John Theriault, formerly Pfizer's security chief and, before that, a special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, leads Apple's global security unit. Don Shruhan, who worked for Theriault at Pfizer, is now a director on Apple's security team in Hong Kong. Shruhan told the Beijing embassy official that his group at Pfizer spent five years planning raids on counterfeit drug rings, the cable says. He said he's ""afraid"" of the volume of imitation Apple products being produced in China and about the inexperience of Apple's lawyers in dealing with Chinese authorities, the report says. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. A Pfizer spokeswoman, who declined to comment on personnel matters, said the company has a strong global security team to handle the increase in counterfeit medicine worldwide. WikiLeaks, a group that publishes private government documents, posted tens of thousands of previously unreleased U.S. diplomatic cables last week. The reports from the Beijing embassy detailing Apple's piracy crackdown were unclassified, but many were described as ""sensitive"" and ""not for Internet distribution."" In December, Apple said it removed an application from its mobile store that let people browse WikiLeaks documents from their iPhones ""because it violated developer guidelines."" The company suggested that the app broke laws or could be harmful to people, but many free-speech advocates cried censorship, as they have in the past when Apple has pulled apps. The fresh WikiLeaks documents shed new light on Apple's struggles with intellectual-property theft in China, but the subject hasn't completely flown under the radar. Last month, international news media were rapt after discovering that China is home not only to fake Apple gadgets but also to imitation Apple stores, which had many of Apple's signatures. The Chinese government ordered two of the five unofficial stores to close because they had not secured proper business permits, but a spokesman for China's Kunming government defended the others, saying they sell authentic Apple merchandise, according to Reuters. Apple owns and operates four stores in China. The three in Beijing and the one in Shanghai are Apple's highest trafficked and top grossing stores in the world, Peter Oppenheimer, Apple's financial chief, said in an earnings call in January. But the hunger for Apple products is insatiable there. That's why stores have begun to sell the products without Apple's permission, while others are hawking cheaper, lower-quality gadgets that are aesthetically similar and bear the chic Apple logo. China's Guangdong province, the country's most populous region, has become a hub for manufacturing and selling counterfeit Apple products, two of the newly surfaced cables say. The Foxconn Technology Group, which assembles products for Apple, operates factories in Guangdong. Workers typically smuggle parts from the facilities in order to make replicas, said Lilach Nachum, an international business professor for Baruch College in New York who travels frequently to Asia. It's the cost of doing business in China, where many American companies go for inexpensive labor and efficient industrial plants, she said. ""Not to go to China is not really an option,"" Nachum said. ""Companies cannot afford to do that. No one can afford to do that."" China's counterfeiting ring is responsible for supplying India with fake Apple products, the 2008 cable says. In raids, Indian officials uncovered shipments that had moved from China through Hong Kong, the report says. Apple's early plans to go after counterfeiters, according to a cable, involved first targeting offending retailers and street vendors; next, Apple would work with police to raid manufacturing facilities; and finally, the company would pursue online resellers. The plans closely resemble Pfizer's successful strategy, the cable says, citing Shruhan, the Apple director. ""Shruhan said that low-profile retail raids are a good option for Apple, a company that wants to stay away from too much publicity surrounding this issue,"" the cable says. Theriault, Shruhan's boss, briefed Steve Jobs, then CEO, on the plans in 2008, the cable says. But Apple is having limited success. In countless stores and at tables setup on streets, merchants purporting to sell iPods, iPhones and iPads at deeply discounted prices are prevalent, said Wini Chen, a student in San Francisco who recently returned from studying abroad in Beijing. ""They'll say, 'Yeah, we have iPad. We'll give you a really good deal,'"" Chen recalled from her shopping trips. ""If I really want to buy a knockoff Apple product, I could probably do that in 15 minutes."" Chinese officials readily cooperated with pharmaceutical companies on their raids, but that hasn't translated to software, as Microsoft has discovered, or electronics, as Apple is learning, said Nachum, the professor. Whereas a defective pill could cause sickness or death, a shoddy iPod has less dire consequences. Apple had planned to strengthen its case with the government by arguing that defective batteries could blow up and injure people, and that lost tax revenue could have a significant economic impact, the cable says. The arguments weren't very effective. China's government declined to investigate a facility in March 2009 that was manufacturing imitation Apple laptops because it threatened local jobs, says a cable dated April 2009. A different arm of China's government scrapped plans for a raid on an electronics mall in the Guangdong province because it could have driven away shoppers, the cable says. CNN's Katie Glaeser contributed to this report.","Apple is faced with mounting counterfeiting of its products in China .

"Apple said Tuesday that a small amount of its employees' computers had been hacked, but that no data were exposed. The company said the breach occurred when some employees visited a developer website that exploited a vulnerability in the Java browser plug-in, installing malware on their Mac computers. ""We identified a small number of systems within Apple that were infected and isolated them from our network. There is no evidence that any data left Apple,"" the company said in a statement. Apple did not specify when the hack occurred. The company released a Java patch for OS X users that can be installed from Software Update, and said it's planning on releasing a tool Tuesday that will sweep Mac computers for any Java malware and remove the offending software. Reuters first reported the breach early Tuesday. The security breach appears to mirror a similar hack at Facebook in January. On Friday, the social network announced it had been the victim of an intrusion after a handful of employees visited a compromised developer site. Apple is the latest high-profile American entity to say it was the victim of a recent cyberattack, following similar admissions by Twitter, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and the U.S. Department of Energy. While the news organizations said they believed hackers in China were responsible for their intrusions, Facebook, Twitter and Apple have not mentioned China by name. Security company Mandiant published a 60-page report Tuesday linking groups of hackers in China to the Chinese government. The cybersecurity company tracked the attacks to specific networks in Shanghai and some to the headquarters of one of China's secret military groups. Security holes in Oracle's Java have been responsible for a number of the recent attacks. The Department of Homeland Security released a warning about the software in January. Apple pointed out in its statement that Macs running the most recent operating system, OS X Lion, have not come with Java pre-installed and that the computers automatically disable the plug-in after 35-days of inactivity.","Apple says a small amount of its employees' computers have been hacked .

"Washington (CNN) -- To understand how the suspect in the botched terror attack was able to board  a plane, you have to understand how the counterterrorism system that President Obama says failed is supposed to work. The president says the clues were there, and that a fuller, clearer picture of 23-year-old Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab would have emerged if all the bits and pieces had been shared and put together. ""The warning signs would have triggered red flags, and the suspect would have never been allowed to board that plane for America,"" Obama said. The president has ordered a top-to-bottom investigation of the failed terrorist attack on Christmas Day. The preliminary report is expected Thursday. One of the key questions is why wasn't the suspect's visa revoked. The suspect, a Nigerian national, was supposedly on the terrorist watch list. Six weeks ago, his father warned the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria that his son was becoming radicalized and had gone to Yemen. The father provided the embassy with his son's name, birth date and passport number. That information was sent in a routine, unclassified cable known as a visa VIPER to the National Counterterrorism Center in Washington. The details in the cable were ""insufficient for this interagency review process to make a determination that this individual's visa should be revoked,"" State department spokesman Ian Kelly said. In the aftermath of the attempted attack, the State department is directing embassies to include information on whether a person has a U.S. visa when it sends the visa VIPER cables to Washington, a state department official said. The change was prompted by the preliminary reviews Obama ordered due to him Thursday. The information the father provided the embassy with was just one of hundreds of reports, and often vague tips, coming in each day. Analysts from the CIA, FBI, Justice Department and other agencies are supposed to evaluate such tips side by side, running them through databases, comparing them with other clues agencies have gathered, and those still coming in. The purpose is to make sure the even seemingly insignificant dots get connected. The U.S. also had intelligence that between August and October of this year, extremists in Yemen were talking about operations. Someone known as ""the Nigerian"" was mentioned, and they had a partial name -- Umar Farouk. ""At any point along that chain, people have the responsibility for making sure that they are accurately and fully reporting what they've learned. And then there are going to be some judgments that have to be made about whether and what action ought to be taken, based on the information,"" said Michael Chertoff, former Homeland Security Secretary under President Bush. But in this case, with no urgency attached, the father's warning was treated more as a missing-person report. With nothing else alarming coming up, the analysts put the suspect on the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) list, along with 550,000 other suspicious people. And that's where the warnings stopped. To go on to the next step and put someone on a no-fly list or subject them to a secondary screening, there has to be a ""reasonable suspicion"" of a link to terrorism. Under the NCTC rules, the evidence against the bombing suspect wasn't there. No recommendation was made to the State Department to revoke AbdulMutallab's visa. The threshold for taking action is being looked at in the review ordered by the president. The threshold could be made less restrictive to allow a quicker trigger for action such as revoking a visa, according to a source briefed on the review. There was ""not a lack of information collected, but a lack of understanding of what to do with that information,"" the source said. Chertoff said that during his time in the job, there was a ""very good information-sharing system."" ""I think what the current administration is going to be looking at is, was there human failure, either in the initial reporting or in the initial decision about what would be sent up the chain of communication, or in the ultimate determination by the intelligence community about whether this was significant enough to warrant preventing this person from getting on an airplane,"" he said. CNN's Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.","Despite warnings, suspect's visa was not revoked .

"Two days past 18 . He was waiting for the bus in his Army green ... Those are the first two lines from one of the most powerful songs I have ever heard, ""Traveling Soldier."" If you don't know it, I encourage you to look it up -- unless you're one of those folks who still hates the group that made the song popular, in which case, its beauty might be lost on you. It was 10 years ago this week -- as the country was barreling toward war with Iraq -- that Natalie Maines, lead singer of the Dixie Chicks, stood in front of a packed house in London and said: . ""Just so you know, we're on the good side with y'all. We do not want this war, this violence. And we're ashamed the president of the United States is from Texas."" It didn't matter that the evidence to invade Iraq was questionable or that Maines later apologized. The damage was done, and one of the most popular acts in the country became its most hated. Its music was banned from radio, CDs were trashed by bulldozers, and one band member's home was vandalized. Maines introduced ""Soldier"" with a call for peace, but she would soon find that the group needed metal detectors installed at entrances to shows on its stateside tour because of death threats. It was a classic case of freedom of speech meeting the irrational repercussions of that speech. ""Soldier"" is not only their last No. 1, it's still their last single to chart in the top 30. Officially, they've been on hiatus since 2006, but Maines, who is planning on releasing a solo CD in May, recently said, ""I just don't feel like it's the Dixie Chicks' time."" For anyone who appreciates great music, this admission should be vexing. Prior to Maines' 2003 comments, the group's previous two CDs had sold at least 10 million copies each, and they were singing the National Anthem at the Super Bowl. In two years, they had won eight Academy of Country Music Awards, including the male-dominated Entertainer of the Year category in 2000.  But they didn't reach that level of popularity because of sexy outfits and Auto-Tuned vocals. They are immensely talented. If anything, Maines and company should be viewed as prophets, not pariahs, considering that the weapons of mass destruction the Bush administration led the country to believe Saddam Hussein was housing were never found. Or that since 2006, the majority of Americans have felt the invasion was a mistake to begin with. And yet, despite all that we now know, the Chicks remain ostracized in the world they came from, as if they were the ones who presented false information to the United Nations Security Council; as if they waged a war Tony Blair's right-hand man now says ""cannot be justified""; as if the misguided attack were their fault. Before the group was set to do an interview with Diane Sawyer in late April 2003 -- with hopes of stopping the public relations bleeding -- they questioned why they needed to grovel and beg for Bush's forgiveness. In a scene from the 2006 documentary ""Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing,"" their own PR rep explains, ""he's got sky-high approval. The war couldn't be going better. By the time this interview airs ... the looting will be done; the rebuilding of Iraq will be started. ... Two weeks from now, it's going to be even a more positive situation."" Soon after,  Bush delivered a victory speech on the deck of an aircraft carrier, underneath a banner that read ""Mission Accomplished."" The war wasn't declared over until eight years later. And somehow, folks remain mad at the Chicks. Last week, in marking the 10-year anniversary of Maines' comments, Country Music Television asked fans whether the Chicks should be forgiven, and more than a third of responders said ""no."" Which probably explains why their next performances are in Canada.","LZ Granderson: 10 years ago, Dixie Chicks' comments on Iraq war drew denunciations .

"Winter was coming, but for many HBO Go users, it didn't arrive Sunday night as expected. A rush of viewers onto the cable network's mobile streaming app for the season premiere of ""Game of Thrones"" caused it to crash, making it inaccessible for many. ""HBO Go did experience issues due to overwhelming demand around the premiere of Game of Thrones,"" the network said in a statement. HBO is a subsidiary of Time Warner, which also owns CNN. The Internet, as might be expected, was less than thrilled. ""You had one job, HBO Go ... ,"" wrote M.G. Siegler, a partner at Google Ventures, in a series of tweets that included an image of his screen with the persistent ""Accessing HBO Go"" message. It's the second time in less than a month that the app has been clobbered by heavy demand. The March 9 finale of HBO's ""True Detective"" saw lots of users similarly denied access. Sunday night's problems were cleared up by 1 a.m. ET Monday -- or about the time ""Game of Thrones"" was finishing up on the West Coast. ""Thanks for your patience #GOT fans. The service is now restored,"" HBO posted on its Twitter account for HBO Go. While much of the social-media outcry involved Red Wedding-worthy wailing, some folks were joking about another issue that's widely suspected but hard to quantify. ""So, like, at least 90 percent of the people trying to watch HBO GO instead of watching GOT on TV are using somebody else's login, right?"" tweeted Linda Holmes, a writer for NPR's pop culture blog, Monkey See. Walter Hickey, a lifestyle writer for FiveThirtyEight, joked -- we think -- about that very thing.

"Friends and relatives Wednesday paid their respects to Tyler Doohan, the 8-year-old upstate New York boy who helped rescue six relatives from a fire but then perished while trying to save his grandfather. In a Mass at St. John of Rochester Catholic Church, Tyler was honored with a firefighter's funeral. The funerals of two other relatives who also died in the fire were held at the same time. The church was filled with mourners, including basketball players from Wisconsin Silver Lake College, who were so moved by his story that they traveled to New York to be pallbearers. In addition, firefighters from multiple jurisdictions stood at attention in Class A dress uniforms as bagpipers played traditional music, as is customary when a firefighter is laid to rest. Penfield Fire Chief Chris Ebmeyer declared Tyler an honorary firefighter and presented his family with a special fire helmet inscribed with the boy's name. ""This is a helmet we give to the family to symbolize that Tyler is indeed a part of the brotherhood of firefighters, as an honorary firefighter in Penfield,"" Ebmeyer said. Tyler's mother, Crystal Vrooman, spoke of her son. ""You're a hero, baby,"" she said through tears. ""You did it huge. I know you're watching this go on, and you should be so proud of yourself."" Tyler's fourth-grade teacher, Denise Alfieri, also spoke at the service, ""Monday January 20th was the day that changed our lives forever,"" she said, reflecting on the loss felt in her classroom the day the boy perished. ""There is an emptiness and a void that now fills Room 240."" Tyler, an East Rochester resident, was staying at the home of relatives in Penfield on January 19 when he noticed a fire in the singlewide trailer, officials said. As firefighters and sheriff's deputies responded to a 4:45 a.m. emergency call, Tyler was able to wake six other people in the small trailer, including two more children, ages 4 and 6, the fire officials said. Then Tyler went back into the blaze to help his grandfather, who was disabled and would have been unable to get out of the home on his own. ""By that time, the fire had traveled to the back of the trailer,"" Ebmeyer said at the time. ""Unfortunately, they both succumbed to heat and smoke."" The pair were found together on a bed in the back room. It appeared that the boy was trying to lift his grandfather from the bed when he was overcome by the smoke and fire, fire officials said.","Tyler Doohan, 8, saved six relatives from a fire in New York state .

"A Texas company says it has made the first metal gun using a 3-D printer, taking the debate over people's emerging ability to create their own firearms to a new level. Solid Concepts, a specialty manufacturing company, said in a blog post it has fired more than 50 rounds from the handgun, even hitting a few bull's-eyes at more than 30 yards. The pistol is a version of an M1911, a handgun designed by John Browning and first used widely in the latter stages of combat stemming from the Philippine-American War. It's built from 33 mostly stainless-steel parts and has a carbon-fiber handgrip carved with a laser. ""The 3-D-printed metal gun proves that 3-D printing isn't just making trinkets and Yoda heads,"" the company said in the blog post. Solid Concepts went out of its way Friday to point out that producing the metal gun isn't meant to advance a trend that worries law enforcement and some politicians. As 3-D printers become more widespread and affordable, some envision a near future in which criminals can crank out untraceable weapons without having to leave their homes. ""Let me start out by saying one, very important thing: This is not about desktop 3-D printers,"" Alyssa Parkinson, a spokeswoman for the company, wrote in the blog post. The metal gun wasn't a move toward making firearms with a 3-D printer cheaper or more accessible, she wrote. Basic 3-D printers, such as the MakerBot Replicator 2, can be bought for around $2,000. But Solid Concepts used a specialized, high-end printer whose cost would be out of reach of most people. ""The industrial printer we used costs more than my college tuition (and I went to a private university),"" Parkinson said. ""And the engineers who run our machines are top of the line; they are experts who know what they're doing and understand 3-D printing better than anyone in this business."" Solid Concepts wanted to show that 3-D printing is more than just hobbyists churning out plastic doodads -- it's a viable option for serious commercial use. ""It's a common misconception that 3-D printing isn't accurate or strong enough, and we're working to change people's perspectives,"" Kent Firestone, a vice president at the company, said in a statement. In May, a nonprofit group, also from Texas, stirred far more controversy when it posted a video of the live firing of a plastic handgun created with a 3-D printer. Cody Wilson, a 25-year-old self-described anarchist, posted instructions on how to make the gun online through his nonprofit group, Defense Distributed. Those instructions were taken down after the U.S. State Department sent the group a cease-and-desist letter. The group's website was shut down shortly afterward. Solid Concepts is a licensed firearm manufacturer. It said one use for its new capabilities with 3-D printers may be selling replacement parts for handguns.","Solid Concepts is a licensed firearm manufacturer .

"Some iPhone 5 users are complaining that a burst of purple is showing up in their photos -- and Apple seems to be acknowledging it's just part of how the camera works. Since Apple's new smartphone was released just over a week ago, some of the millions of users have reported that, when a strong source of light is present in their photographs, the light takes on a purple hue. The problem was first noted on the forums of online computer magazine Anandtech, where a thread discussing the issue had more than 180 comments Wednesday. ""Yeah, I have a feeling this is going to be Antennagate all over again,"" one forum member wrote, referencing antenna problems with the iPhone 4. ""I've taken 20,000+ photos on my 4S, never ONCE had this problem."" That user then posted two photos that appear to show the flare. An e-mail from Apple appears to confirm that the purple haze isn't all in users' minds. Tech blog Gizmodo quoted an e-mail from Apple support to a reader. He claims Apple support staff first said the discoloration shouldn't be happening but shifted after talking to Apple engineers. ""Our engineering team just gave me this information and we recommend that you angle the camera away from the bright light source when taking pictures,"" read the e-mail, as reported by Gizmodo. ""The purple flare in the image provided is considered normal behavior for iPhone 5's camera."" Apple did not respond to a message seeking comment for this story. A comparison by Mashable, a CNN content partner, studied similar images taken with an iPhone 5, an iPhone 4S and a Nikon D300. Some of the 5's images had a purple glow around light sources, while others didn't, Mashable reported. None of the images from the other two devices displayed the flares. Some have speculated that the problem is caused by a sapphire cover that Apple added to the phone's camera. ""The new iSight camera in iPhone 5 features a sapphire crystal lens cover that is thinner and more durable than standard glass with the ability to provide crystal clear images,"" Apple wrote in promotional material for the phone. The iPhone 5 has been Apple's biggest launch to date, selling 2 million units in the first 24 hours and 5 million over its first weekend on the market. But with its popularity have come a handful of persistent complaints, the purple glow being the most recent to gain traction. Foremost have been problems with Apple's new Maps feature, which for the first time replaced Google Maps as the default mapping software on Apple's mobile operating system. The problems -- landmarks misplaced or misnamed, huge swaths of major cities missing -- prompted Apple CEO Tim Cook to offer a rare apology, promising that it will be fixed and going so far as to suggest other apps in the meantime. Other iPhone 5 complaints have ranged from its aluminum casing scratching easily to light leaking from openings on the phone.

"(CNN) -- Gov. Sarah Palin on Wednesday said Sen. Barack Obama has ties to a Columbia University professor who she said is ""a former spokesperson for the Palestinian Liberation Organization."" The Obama campaign said on its Web site that ""ugly insinuations about Barack Obama's relationship with a former neighbor and university colleague ... are completely false."" The professor has denied he was a spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organization. Palin said her assertion ""is not negative campaigning to call someone out on their record."" ""It seems that there is yet another radical professor from the neighborhood who spent a lot of time with Barack Obama going back several years,"" Palin said at an event in Bowling Green, Ohio. ""This is important because his associate, Rashid Khalidi ... in addition to being a political ally of Barack Obama, he's a former spokesperson for the Palestinian Liberation Organization.""  Watch Palin say the LA Times is 'kowtowing' to Obama » . Sen. John McCain's campaign repeatedly has sought to tie Obama to former 1960s radical William Ayers, who co-founded the Weather Underground. Ayers is a professor at the University of Illinois. Khalidi has been a harsh critic of U.S. foreign policy toward Israel and has accused the country of ""occupying"" Palestinian territories. But he has denied acting as a PLO spokesman during a seven-year period in the 1970s and 1980s. Khalidi said Wednesday, ""I am not speaking to the media at this time, and certainly not until this idiot wind passes."" The Obama campaign called Palin's remarks ""another recycled, manufactured controversy from the McCain campaign to distract voters' attention from John McCain's lockstep support for George Bush's economic policies."" In April, the Los Angeles Times published an article about a going-away dinner for Khalidi that Obama attended in Chicago, Illinois, in 2003. Khalidi was leaving to become a professor at Columbia.  Watch McCain push Obama's link to Khalidi » . The paper reported that a young Palestinian-American woman recited a poem at the farewell party that accused the Israeli government of terrorism for its treatment of Palestinians and was highly critical of U.S. support of Israel. The McCain campaign accused the Los Angeles paper of ""intentionally suppressing"" a videotape it obtained from that dinner and demanded that it release the footage. The Times said it won't release the footage because a reporter promised a source that the video would not be made public. Asked why the McCain campaign was bringing the matter up six months after the article appeared, an aide replied, ""Because we are one week away from potentially electing Barack Obama."" At an event Wednesday in Raleigh, North Carolina, Obama said McCain has spent the last few days calling him ""every name in the book."" ""I don't know what's next. By the end of the week, he'll be accusing me of being a secret communist because I shared my toys in kindergarten. I shared my peanut butter and jelly sandwich,"" Obama said.  Watch Obama scoff at 'socialist' label » . Earlier Wednesday, Palin delivered her second policy address of the campaign season. Palin said she and McCain are determined to put the country on ""a path toward energy independence"" and charged that an Obama administration would hinder that process. Palin pointed to her experience as governor as evidence she can help the U.S. achieve energy security. ""Whatever the good ol' boys are running these days, I know it's not the state of Alaska,"" she said in Toledo, Ohio. Palin said that by relying on oil from the Middle East, ""we not only provide wealth to the sponsors of terror, but we provide high-value targets to the terrorists themselves."" The Alaska governor stressed expanding drilling, using nuclear power and tapping into the ""American ingenuity"" to solve the energy problem. ""Energy security is one of the great questions in this election,"" Palin said. ""Sometimes I think it's no wonder that our opponents don't want to talk a whole lot about this, because they don't get it."" Achieving energy security, Palin said, requires a ""clean break"" from the policies of the Bush administration and from ""30 years' worth of failed energy policies in Washington."" Palin described the energy plans of Obama and Sen. Joe Biden as a ""long, labored agenda of inaction."" The Obama campaign sent out a response from Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, which said, ""Palin attacked her own running mate's record today by blaming our oil addiction on '30 years of failure' in Washington."" Later Wednesday, McCain was scheduled to appear on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" at 9 p.m. ET.  Watch McCain say Obama is at the 'far left' of American politics » . That interview comes after a 30-minute Obama campaign ad, which airs during prime-time television Wednesday. It's the first time in 16 years that a presidential candidate has bought a slot in prime time to make his closing argument. The half-hour ad was set to run on NBC, CBS, Fox and Univision at 8 p.m. ET. The spot, which is estimated to have cost about $5 million, includes a live segment from Florida, with voters discussing their problems and Obama laying out his plans for the country. CNN declined the Obama campaign's request to air the ad. CNN said it did not want to pre-empt its programming lineup with a 30-minute paid commercial program. Obama's closing effort also includes an appearance on Comedy Central's ""The Daily Show"" and a late-night rally in Kissimmee, Florida, with former President Clinton. Republicans have been poking fun at Obama's prime-time blitz. The McCain campaign released an ad Wednesday morning that says, ""Behind the fancy speeches, the grand promises, the TV specials lies the truth ... Barack Obama lacks the experience America needs, and it shows.""

"Health screenings to help prevent the spread of Ebola began Saturday for some travelers to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport but an official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that nothing can ""get the risk to zero."" Four other airports will add the screenings Thursday, according to the CDC. This won't be a mass event, with long lines of travelers waiting for screening. Only about 150 travelers a day will receive the screenings, CDC officials said. ""No matter how many of these procedures are put into place, we can't get the risk to zero,"" Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, told reporters Saturday. ""That will not be the case but this additional layer should add a measure of security to the American public. This entry screening procedure, for example, would not necessarily have caught the patient in Dallas."" Cetron was referring to the only case of Ebola so far diagnosed on U.S. soil -- that of Thomas Eric Duncan, who didn't have symptoms at the time he arrived in the United States. Under the program, passengers originating from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone will be subject to the additional screening. Coast Guard corpsmen and eventually medical workers under contract will take the passengers' temperature and Customs and Border Protection staffers will ask questions about their health and possible exposure to Ebola. Those suspected of possible Ebola exposure will be referred to a CDC public health officer for additional screening. After the initial run Saturday at JFK, the testing will expand Thursday to Washington-Dulles, Newark, Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta. The five airports, JFK included, receive 94% of air travelers who come from the afflicted countries, according to the CDC. ""The expanded screening measures provide this layer of protection to the already established protocols to minimize the risk of another case of Ebola here in the United States,"" said R. Gil Kerlikowske, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Kerlikowske said travelers with fever or other symptoms or who may have been exposed to Ebola will be referred to the CDC to determine whether they can travel or should be taken to a hospital. In addition, Border Patrol agents will monitor travelers for signs of illness. Cetron said all travelers leaving the affected countries are already being screened with questionnaires about possible exposure and symptoms and having their temperatures checked. ""More than 36,000 passengers have been screened with this tool the last two months and not a single Ebola case has been detected,"" he said. Reporter's Notebook: Why we haven't stopped Ebola . Will it help? Some critics of the U.S. approach say the screenings won't do much from a public health perspective. ""I think they offer some margin of, I don't know, peace of mind for the public,"" said Laurie Garrett, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of ""The Coming Plague."" But she stressed the screenings would not have detected Duncan's case. ""So I see this more as something to calm the nerves of the American people, the British people, the French people,"" she said. Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation, said the effort isn't ""entirely window dressing, because we have to do something."" ""But,"" she said, ""there's much more that has to be done to keep people safe."" She says she worries about planes carrying ill passengers who may not be detected until after they get off the flight. By then, the plane may have already been prepared for another flight. Health officials have warned the screenings will likely catch some people with fevers, but not Ebola, and could miss some with Ebola as symptoms can take up to 21 days to appear. ""No exit or entry screening will supplant the need for state and local health departments, for clinicians and for individuals to be aware and to think Ebola,"" Cetron said. How the Ebola virus spreads . Outbreak in Africa . At least 8,399 people are believed to have contracted the disease as of October 7, according to the World Health Organization. Of those, 4,033 have died, the agency said. Among health care workers fighting the outbreak, 416 are believed to have caught the disease and 233 have died, according to WHO. The numbers were reported from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Spain and the United States. U.S. troops battle invisible enemy in Liberia . American cases . Aid workers Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly contracted the disease in Liberia while working with Samaritan's Purse to care for Ebola patients.

A third patient, Dr. Rick Sacra, was flown to Omaha, Nebraska, after contracting the disease while working in Liberia. He was discharged in September. Doctors at the same hospital are now caring for Ashoka Mukpo, an NBC News videographer diagnosed with Ebola on October 2. Mukpo's condition continues to improve, according to a statement from The Nebraska Medical Center. ""Mr. Mukpo is still very weak, but his condition has improved since yesterday,"" said Dr. Phil Smith, medical director of the Biocontainment Unit at The Nebraska Medical Center. ""He's eating some solid food now, so we're still headed in the right direction. ... The severity and unknown aspects of the disease we're dealing with always have to be kept in mind."" Mukpo has received the experimental drug Brincidofovir, along with a blood transfusion from Brantly, an Ebola survivor, the statement said. Authorities  imposed a mandatory quarantine on NBC News staffers who worked with Mukpo after the workers violated a voluntary quarantine, New Jersey health officials said. Mukpo was among a team working with Dr. Nancy Snyderman, the news agency's chief medical correspondent. ""The NBC crew remains symptom-free, so there is no reason for concern of exposure to the community,"" said Donna Leusner, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Health. CDC director on Ebola: 'Only thing like this has been AIDS' In other countries . Morocco . The Confederation of African Football said the 2015 African Cup of Nations, a soccer competition, will go ahead as scheduled despite fears about Ebola by Morocco. The competition is scheduled to be held in Morocco from January 17 to February 8. ""CAF has registered the request and wishes to state that there are no changes of the schedules of its competitions and events,"" the group said in a statement released Saturday. ""It must be noted that since the first edition in 1957, the Africa Cup of Nations has never witnessed a deferral or a change in schedule."" The CAF said it took into account recommendations from the World Health Organization and other medical experts. United Kingdom . In London, the UK Department of Health said enhanced screening will be implemented at London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Eurostar terminals. The screenings will involve assessing passengers' recent travel history, who they have been in contact with and onward travel arrangements, the department said. English medical professionals, such as doctors and ambulance drivers, participated in a nationwide drill on Saturday on the handling of Ebola cases. Spain . Teresa Romero Ramos, a nurse's assistant in Spain who is the first person to contract Ebola outside Africa, has been treated with the anti-influenza drug Avigan, hospital sources with knowledge of the case said Saturday. Romero was in ""stable but serious"" condition Saturday after taking a turn for the worse earlier in the week, according to the hospital sources. ""Teresa is conscious and talking,"" a hospital source said. A special committee created by the Spanish government to tackle the Ebola crisis reported no significant changes in her condition Saturday, according to the Carlos III hospital spokeswoman. After the nurse's assistant was diagnosed with Ebola, 16 people related to the case were being monitored in a Madrid hospital, including an emergency room doctor, the neighborhood doctor who saw her before the case was confirmed, and the nurse's husband, according to a government source. Those being monitored also included three people admitted to Hospital Carlos III Friday night -- a beautician, a nurse and a hospital cleaner. ""There has not been any change worth mentioning relating to those admitted, and they all remain asymptomatic,"" the special committee said. The nurse admitted to the hospital Friday was told she needs to remain there for 21 days, a man who identified himself as her father said Saturday. The nurse, a friend of  Romero, works at the same hospital as the nurse's assistent, Alcorcon hospital . ""She is fine, no symptoms,"" her father said, adding that he hasn't seen her. He said he ""just brought some things for her. When the doctors come in they wear the protective suits."" Another nurse under observation tested negative for the Ebola virus, the committee said Saturday. The nurse has been discharged but will remain under observation outside the hospital until her quarantine ends on October 16, the committee said. Romero became sick after she helped treat an Ebola-stricken Spanish missionary. Her case has prompted questions from her fellow medical professionals about whether they are properly equipped to safely treat Ebola patients, and about why a week passed before she was treated. But experts from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control who visited the hospital over the past three days said in  the ""procedure and action"" carried out at the hospital complied with established protocols. The statement added, ""The current infrastructure is not designed to deal with this type of emergency. Nevertheless, the action and measures which have been taken, and which continue to be taken at present, are likely to improve it."" Russia . Russia plans to introduce Ebola vaccines within the next six months, the country's health minister said, according to Russian state news agency Ria Novosti. ""We are now creating three vaccines... and they will be created, we think, in the next six months,"" Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said, according to Ria Novosti. Skvortsova also said Russia is working on creating special drugs to be used in preventing and treating Ebola, the news agency reported.

"Snapchat is trying to get away from its reputation as a service for randy sexting teens and secretive philanderers. ""It's not a good way to send inappropriate photos,"" said Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel at the San Francisco Techcrunch Disrupt conference on Monday. Snapchat is a popular mobile messaging app for sending self-destructing messages. Private photo and text messages disappear forever after one to 10 seconds. More than 350 million of these messages, called ""snaps,"" are traded every day on Snapchat, according to Spiegel. The short lifespan of the messages is what has made the 2-year-old app a natural for content people don't want falling into the wrong hands, such as naughty photos. Meet the kid-friendly version of Snapchat . Spiegel pointed out that it is possible for a recipient to take take screenshots of snaps, and said it was even possible for determined hackers with time and money to access the messages and ""betray your trust."" Touting the potential security flaws of a product might seem like an odd move for a popular app, but for Snapchat to continue growing at a rapid pace it needs to appeal to a wider audience. Last year, Snapchat told AllThingsD that most of its users were from 13 to 23. The company needs to pull in more adults, starting with the founder's parents. ""I was just snapping my mom this morning,"" said Spiegel. The company is also dabbling in the wearable computing world. On Monday, it announced a new app for the  Samsung Galaxy Gear smartwatch called Snapchat Micro. With the app, users can upload photos taken with the watch's small camera, shaving a few seconds off the time it takes to share a moment. Snapchat may be moving on to wrists, but it won't be coming to your face anytime soon. Spiegel said the company had no plans to develop for Google Glass and dismissed the technology as invasive, saying, ""You kind of feel like you have a gun pointed at you."" Google's wearable computing system has already stirred up privacy concerns for its ability to surreptitiously capture photos, and the association could be just the kind of negative publicity Snapchat is trying so hard to avoid. Spiegel didn't express the same concerns about a wearable wristwatch, but not because a tiny camera on a wrist is necessarily safer. He thinks Gear owners won't abuse the tool to take sneaky photos because he believes people are ""generally not mean."" The other challenge for the company is actually making money off the service. Instead of taking the usual route and adding in display ads, Spiegel said the company was leaning toward in-app transactions. Investors seem confident that revenue details will be ironed out. In June, Snapchat received another $60 million in funding. For now, the company is continuing to pitch itself as a wholesome app that's fun for the whole family. ""We don't want to be a place for people to share mean secrets,"" said Spiegel. Blissfully wired: 10 rules for digital happiness . How Galaxy Gear stacks up to other smartwatches .

"When Barack Obama was a newbie president, there was no shortage of ambition or lack of confidence in the government he was about to lead. Government should be seen as a force for good, not evil. Sure, he told us, it needed to be ""smarter and better,"" but that could—and would—happen under his watch. Never mind that Bill Clinton spent years ""reinventing government"" with mixed success. Or that only 2% of the American public believes that government can be trusted to do the right thing all the time. President Obama was convinced he could change all that with programs that would deliver for America—such as health care reform—and the public would be grateful. Instead, the President is living his own version of ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"": staring down a rabbit hole of government bureaucracy and inefficiency. The government he has studiously tried to grow, manage and change has become his own personal nemesis. All of which makes you wonder: Does the President himself trust government anymore? The scandal at the Department of Veterans Affairs is just the latest in a slew of bureaucratic messes that strike at the core power point of the Obama presidency: Making government work. Consider the disastrous health care website rollout. The IRS controversy. Even the question of NSA surveillance raises questions about the role of government: Did the civil libertarian Obama allow spies to run amok? The President is clearly having a running debate with himself over all this. About a year ago, after the NSA program was revealed and Democrats and libertarians started squawking, Obama seemed more than a tad defensive on government spying.  ""If people can't trust not only the executive branch but also don't trust Congress ... to make sure that we're abiding by the Constitution ..."" he said, ""then we're going to have some problems here."" Indeed. These are not trivial matters. Health care is the signature legislative achievement of the administration, and a botched rollout made it smell bad at the start. Fixing the VA—and aiding veterans—is a cornerstone of the Obama presidency. And yet, it all looks as if somehow the bureaucracy has beaten the boss. It's a management issue. So far as I can tell, the governing style of this administration has two extremes: issues singled out for micromanagement (as in, foreign policy, from the West Wing) and issues completely delegated (as in, VA management). What seems to be  missing is the in-between: the continual monitoring and early warning system that avoids presidential blindsiding. That's the area in which most of the business of government actually gets done. And it can get done. The apparatus to do the nation's business in a competent way is there. Use it, and manage it. That's what chief executives are hired to do. Government is unwieldy and difficult and hard to tame, sure. But if your presidency is based, in large part, on telling Americans that government can work for them--which it can--you need to make it work. It's not that the President is a hopeless manager. He does very well when he leads a hierarchical organization with a single goal, like a presidential bid. He's top dog, he's not negotiating with anybody, and he's not trying to get people to do things they don't want to do. In a campaign, for instance, they all want to elect the same person: him. But when you have to negotiate—or lead—people not related to you, or not indebted to you or who don't agree with you, it's a different story. Managing or negotiating with people with mixed motives (Congress, anyone?) is not an Obama strong point. By nature, bureaucracies are hard to trust and even harder to tame.  And if a chief executive isn't careful, it's an energy-sapping (and legacy endangering) vortex that sucks you right in. Just ask Obama, who was government's best friend. Does he still feel that way today? Hard to know. But my guess is he's a bit like Alice in Wonderland. ""I can't go back to yesterday,"" she said, ""because I was a different person then.""

"(CNN Student News) -- The following resource contains answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about the Electoral College. Who actually elects the president of the United States? When voters go to the polls on Election Day, they do not vote directly for a presidential candidate. Instead, they cast their votes for a slate of electors who have been given the authority by the United States Constitution to elect the president and vice president. The electors are known collectively as the Electoral College. At the Constitutional Convention of 1787, delegates debated the manner in which the president of the United States was to be elected. Some argued that the Congress should select the president, while other proposals recommended election by the people, the governors of the states or state legislatures. A compromise was reached in what became known as the Electoral College. Technically, it is these electors, and not the American voters, who elect the president. Why the Electoral College instead of direct vote by the people? The Constitution's framers established the Electoral College as a way to avoid the direct popular election of the president. Some of the Constitution's authors did not trust the ability of the common voter to make the ""right"" decision, so they devised the Electoral College as one way of lessening the power of the popular vote. How does the Electoral College work? The Electoral College, as established by the U.S. Constitution, currently includes 538 members: one for each U.S. senator and representative and three for the District of Columbia (under the 23rd Amendment of 1961). Each state is allocated a number of electors equal to the number of its U.S. senators (always 2) plus the number of its members in the U.S. House of Representatives (based on population, this is subject to change with the Census every ten years). So, the breakdown of electors is as follows: . 100 Senate seats + 435 House of Representative seats + 3 Washington, D.C. = 538 total electors . Since the number of electors per state varies by population, California holds the most electors with 55. Several states have only three electors, which is the smallest number a state can have based on the formula described above. For any presidential candidate to win, he or she must gain a majority of the 538 votes, or the magic number of 270. If no one candidate reaches 270 electoral votes, the election is thrown into the House of Representatives to be decided (under the 12th Amendment of 1804). This has happened twice in U.S. history, both in the 19th century, but the scenario could conceivably become reality in modern times with a popular third-party candidate gathering some of the electoral votes and siphoning them away from the other two candidates. How are presidential electors selected? Article II, section 1 of the Constitution provides that, ""No Senator or Representative, or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States shall be appointed an elector."" Aside from this disqualification, any person is qualified to be an elector for president and vice president. The Constitution does not specify procedures for nominating candidates for presidential electors. Thirty-six states nominate their elector candidates by state party convention, and ten of the states nominate their electors by state party committee. Generally, elector candidates tend to be prominent state and local officeholders, party activists and other citizens associated with the party for which they are nominated. The Constitution left the method of selecting electors and of awarding electoral votes to the States. In the early years of the Republic, many states provided for selection of electors by the state legislatures. Since 1864, all states have provided for popular election of electors for president and vice president. In 48 states and the District of Columbia, the presidential candidate who gets the most votes wins all the electoral votes in that state. This is known as the ""general ticket"" or ""winner take all"" system. Currently, Maine and Nebraska provide the only exception to the ""winner take all"" method, awarding one electoral vote to the ticket gaining the most votes in each of the states' congressional districts, and awarding the remaining two (representing their senatorial allotment) to the winners of the most votes statewide. This variation, called the ""direct system,"" was more widely used in the 19th century. Can a candidate win the popular vote but lose the election? Under the ""winner take all"" system, it is possible for a candidate to win several large states and some smaller ones and get the magic number of 270, but have fewer popular votes nationwide than his or her opponent. Popular vote winners have failed to win the presidency on four occasions since the adoption of the 12th Amendment: in 1824, 1876, 1888 and 2000. In 1824, the electoral vote was split among four candidates, necessitating election by the House of Representatives, which chose the popular vote runner-up. In 1876, due to contested returns from four states, Congress set up an electoral commission which awarded the disputed votes to the apparent popular vote runner-up, resulting in a one-vote margin in the Electoral College. In 1888, the apparent popular vote runner-up won a comfortable Electoral College majority. In 2000, the popular vote winner lost in the Electoral College after the outcome of a contested vote in Florida. When does all of this take place? On the Tuesday following the first Monday of November, in years divisible by four. According to the U.S. Constitution, voters in each state cast their ballots for the party slate of electors who represent their choice for president and vice president. Whichever party wins that state's popular vote for president receives the elector votes for that state. On the Monday following the second Wednesday of December, by federal law, each state's electors meet in their respective capitals and cast their votes, one for president and one for vice president. These electoral votes are sealed and transmitted from each state to the president of the Senate, who, on the following January 6, opens and reads them before both houses of Congress. The candidate for president who has attained the majority of electoral votes (270) is then declared the president. The new president and vice president are sworn in at noon on January 20.

"It may have been the most anticipated traffic court date ever. Southern California resident Cecilia Abadie appeared in San Diego traffic court on Thursday for speeding and for wearing Google Glass while driving. It is considered the first time someone has been cited for wearing the face-mounted technology while driving. Commissioner John Blair threw out both charges, stating there wasn't enough evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Google Glass was turned on at the time. It is only illegal to wear the device while driving if it is operational. Abadie was pulled over in October for speeding by the California Highway Patrol. The officer then cited her for wearing Google Glass under California vehicle code 27602, which prohibits operating a video-display in front of the driver's head rest where it can distract the driver. The law was originally drafted to keep people from watching TV while driving. Google Glass is Google's early version of a head-mounted computer display. A small square monitor sits above the right eye, just out of the normal line of vision. To view information on the display like a map or text message, the wearer must look up. Google Glass defenders claim Glass is safer to use while driving than a smartphone since it can be voice controlled and you only have to glance up to view the Glass display. Many rallied to Abadie's defense, even starting a #freececilia hashtag on Twitter. When asked to comment on the case, a Google spokesperson sent the following statement to CNN: . ""Glass is built to connect you more with the world around you, not distract you from it. As we make clear in our help center, Explorers should always use Glass responsibly and put their safety and the safety of others first. ""It's early days for Glass and we look forward to hearing feedback from Explorers and others in advance of a wider consumer launch this year."" On Google's Glass FAQ page, the company warns: ""Most states have passed laws limiting the use of mobile devices while driving any motor vehicle, and most states post those rules on their department of motor vehicles websites. Read up and follow the law!"" ""Anything that distracts you from driving is something that were concerned about,"" said CHP Public Affairs Officer Jake Sanchez. While the ruling was a big win for Abadie, a product manager who wears her Glass 12 hours a day (she rested them around her neck while in the courtroom), it is not a green light for Google Glass wearers to freely wear and use their devices while driving. ""It doesn't necessarily answer the question everybody wanted: Is it legal to drive down the road wearing Google Glass while it's operating?"" said William Concidine of My Traffic Guys. Concidine and his partner, Gabriel Moore, are the traffic ticket attorneys who defended Abadie in court on Thursday. Google Glass wearers in California can still be pulled over and cited for wearing the head-mounted displays while driving. Whether they get a warning or a ticket will be up to the individual officer. Getting a charges dismissed will then be up to individual traffic court judges. ""There is no law that that specifically says Google Glass is illegal. Each officer has to take each case on a case-by-case basis,"" said Sanchez. A dismissal in court is not uncommon for traffic violations, and this ruling will not change how CHP officers view distracted driving. ""I do think it leaves it up in the air for Google Glass wearers,"" said Concidine. ""They have to wear it with the possibility that they may get a ticket that they'll have to fight until a legislator takes some sort of action."" Three states have already drafted laws that specifically ban Google Glass while driving: Delaware, West Virginia and New Jersey.","Charges dismissed for woman ticketed for wearing Google Glass while driving .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani authorities are blaming Friday's deadly attacks in Lahore on militants with ties to the Pakistani Taliban. Akram Naeem, spokesman for the Punjab police, said the attackers are terrorists from the Waziristan tribal region of Pakistan, where the Pakistani Taliban group maintains a strong presence. Interior Minister Rehman Malik said there had been intelligence earlier in the month that an attack could happen in Lahore and that Punjab police did take some steps to react. Then on Friday morning, attackers with bombs and firearms targeted houses of worship in Lahore belonging to the Ahmadi sect, a persecuted religious group. The death toll stood at 98, officials said Saturday, and dozens more were wounded in the attacks. The scenario jibes with Malik's belief that the country will endure more sectarian and ethnic violence. He said he believes ""hostile elements"" like the Pakistani Taliban and other militant groups ""are trying to destablize Pakistan."" Most of the dead -- 75 -- were killed at the place of worship in the Model Town neighborhood. The remaining 23 were killed in the Garhi Shahu neighborhood, he said. Witnesses and officials said the attackers tossed hand grenades and fired weapons, including AK-47s. In the Model Town attack, one of the gunmen was critically injured and another was detained, police said. Ahmadis regard themselves as Muslim, but the government says they aren't, and many Muslim extremists have targeted them. Sunni and Shiite Muslims say Ahmadis are not Muslim because they do not regard Mohammed as the last prophet sent by God. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, a nongovernmental organization, deplored the attacks and said it had warned the Punjab provincial government about threats to the Ahmadi community center in Model Town for more than a year. Lahore is the capital of Punjab province. The movement was founded in 1889. Its followers believe that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who lived between 1835 and 1908, was sent by God as a prophet ""to end religious wars, condemn bloodshed and reinstitute morality, justice and peace,"" the worldwide Ahmadi group says. The group, which is thought to number between 3 million and 4 million people in the country, endures ""the most severe legal restrictions and officially sanctioned discrimination"" among Pakistan's religious minorities, according to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. The religious freedom commission, an independent, bipartisan U.S. government body, said in its latest annual report that ""Ahmadis may not call their places of worship 'mosques,' worship in non-Ahmadi mosques or public prayer rooms which are otherwise open to all Muslims, perform the Muslim call to prayer, use the traditional Islamic greeting in public, publicly quote from the Quran or display the basic affirmation of the Muslim faith."" The agency says it's illegal for the group to preach publicly, pursue converts or pass out religious material, and adherents are restricted from holding public conferences and traveling to Saudi Arabia for the hajj pilgrimage. While the greatest number of its followers are in Pakistan and India, Ahmadis have a presence in many European countries, such as Britain, where the religion's fifth and current spiritual head, Mirza Masroor Ahmad, resides.","NEW: Intelligence warned of possible Lahore attack .

"It's finally legal to swim off the shore of Orange Beach, Alabama, after a crowd of sharks dispersed into deeper waters Tuesday, officials say. The trouble on Orange Beach began Friday when a helicopter pilot took a picture of five sharks circling a boat near Perdido Pass. The pilot relayed the picture to the city administrator, who told lifeguards to get swimmers out of the water. What on Earth eats a 9-foot great white? On Saturday afternoon, double red flags -- warnings to would-be swimmers to stay out of the Gulf of Mexico -- were raised over the half-mile stretch of beach where the number of sharks continued to grow. ""There have been a significant amount of shark sightings prompting us to close the water in these areas. It is unlawful to enter the water when double red flags are flying,"" read a Saturday post on the Orange Beach Fire Department's Facebook page. From that point, the situation only got worse. Orange Beach safety director Melvin Shepard, who says swarms like this are extremely rare, told CNN he saw a photo of 18 sharks in the same stretch of water Sunday. ""I've lived on the coast here my whole life, and I've never seen a group of sharks as large as this one,"" said Shepard. So what's drawing the sharks? Shepard has a hunch. Coastal Alabama is known for its fresh seafood, and fishing boats are a common sight on the horizon. It's customary for fishermen returning to port to clean their catch and dump the waste material -- heads, tails, guts, bones -- into the water, leaving it to the mercy of the tides. ""When the water gets pulled out into the Gulf, the carcasses go with it. ... If (sharks) see a free meal, they're going to come get it,"" Shepard said. Drawn ever closer to the source of their free lunches, the sharks could have entered waters close to shore, setting off the dangerous state of affairs in Orange Beach. The sharks began to move away from the beach Monday. According to the fire department's Facebook page, aerial reports from that evening showed substantial dissipation in the sharks' ranks. It was not until early Tuesday afternoon that Orange Beach was given the all-clear. The ban on entering the water was lifted after officials aerially observed only a few sharks off the jetties at Perdido Pass. Rare goblin shark wasn't the only thing that surfaced .

"(CNN) -- Like thousands of other female applicants to Indonesia's National Police, 24-year-old Sari (not her real name) submitted to the mandatory ""virginity test"" that the authorities require women -- but not men -- to take as part of the application process. In a police hospital in the city of Makassar in 2008, Sari says that she and 20 other fellow police recruits were told to undress, lie down on a table and allow a physician to perform a ""two-finger test."" Six years later, Sari says she is still traumatized. ""I feared that after they performed the test I would not be a virgin anymore. It really hurt. My friend even fainted because...it really hurt, really hurt."" Indonesia's National Police have imposed these abusive and degrading tests on thousands of female applicants since as early as 1965, despite the fact that they contravene National Police principles that recruitment must be both ""nondiscriminatory"" and ""humane."" Meanwhile, the tests have been recognized internationally as a violation of human rights, particularly the prohibition against ""cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment"" under article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 16 of the Convention against Torture, both of which Indonesia has ratified. Indeed, last month, the World Health Organization stated unambiguously that ""There is no place for virginity (or 'two-finger') testing; it has no scientific validity."" Indonesia's National Police can't feign ignorance of the tests, nor the opposition to them within police ranks. High Commissioner Sri Rumiati, a police psychologist who now teaches at the Graduate School of Police Sciences in Jakarta, underwent the virginity test in 1984 and subsequently advocated for their abolition. Those efforts prompted colleagues in police recruitment teams in 2010 to defend ""virginity tests"" as a means of preventing ""prostitutes joining the police."" Indonesia's National Police has responded to Human Rights Watch's exposure of this abusive practice with defiance. A senior police official, Inspector General Moechgiyarto, on November 18 confirmed that the National Police required the test for female applicants. But rather than condemning the practice and promising its abolition, Moechgiyarto defended it as a means to ensure the ""high moral standards"" of the police and reportedly suggested that failure of the test was simply proof that applicants were sex workers. ""If she [a candidate) turns out to be a prostitute, then how could we accept her for the job?"" he said. There also are alarming indications that the use of virginity tests extends to other parts of Indonesia's security forces. On November 19, Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Politics, Law and Security, Tedjo Edhi, told reporters that such tests have long been obligatory for female military recruits as well. Sadly, this isn't the first time that Indonesian government officials have advocated such tests for women. In August 2013, H.M. Rasyid, education chief of Prabumulih district in Indonesia's south Sumatra, reportedly sought to impose mandatory ""virginity tests"" on female high school students to tackle perceived problems of ""premarital sex and prostitution."" After Indonesian civil society organizations attacked Rasyid's proposal as ""against human rights"" and then-Indonesian Education Minister Mohammad Nuh, skewered the idea as ""degrading and discriminatory,"" Rasyid backed off, insisting that he had been misquoted by domestic media. But that same month, the semi-official Indonesian Ulema Council in East Java urged the local government to impose ""virginity tests"" as a requirement for all girls entering the city's high schools. ""Virginity tests"" and the Indonesian government's tolerance of such abusive practices are not an isolated attack on women's rights. Instead, they are but one of many far wider-reaching abuses of constitutionally-guaranteed women's rights that have been occurring across the country in recent years. One of the most obvious of those violations is a growing number of discriminatory regulations -- more than 300 -- imposed by local governments since 1999. They range from local bylaws requiring women to wear the hijab to a local government's prohibition against women from dancing. The failure of Indonesia's central government in protecting women's rights is symbolized by the stalled passage of a gender equality bill which has been in draft form since 2009. Former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who left office in October after a decade in office, deserves a portion of the blame for the erosion of basic rights of women and girls. Yudhoyono is seen by many as having traded political support from the Indonesian Ulama Council, Indonesia's top Muslim clerical body, for a commitment to backing fatwas. Such government tolerance for abuses of women's rights must end. President Joko Widodo, who replaced Yudhoyono in October, has an opportunity to send an unambiguous message in the first weeks of his administration that he will not ignore women's rights or undermine them for political gain. Widodo can begin by instructing the National Police to prohibit ""virginity tests"" and ordering local governments to abolish local regulations that violate constitutionally-guaranteed women's rights. These moves would send a much-needed message that the government and its security forces are committed to protecting the rights of women, rather than violating them.","Indonesia's national police force reportedly requires ""virginity tests"" for women .

"(CNN)For many kids living in rural and non-electrified parts of South Africa, the final school bell doesn't just signal the end of another day of learning. Instead, it also means the beginning of an arduous trek through busy and dangerous roads to get back home in time to complete their homework before sunset.

That work turned into Repurpose Schoolbags -- the first green initiative from Rethaka, a social startup Kgatlhanye co-founded alongside childhood friend-turned-business partner Rea Ngwane. The millennial pair -- aged just 21 and 22 years old respectively -- are taking advantage of the plastic waste in their region, upcycling it into 100% recycled plastic schoolbags for local disadvantaged students. But here's the twist -- the bag also doubles as a light. The backpacks feature a solar panel in the flap -- which charges as the children walk to school -- as well as strips of reflective material, an added safety design to make the children more visible to traffic in the early hours. A bright idea . ""One of the first obstacles these kids face is not being able to finish their homework,"" says Kgatlhanye, the first runner-up at the 2014 Anzhisha Prize, a pan-African award celebrating entrepreneurs aged 15-22 who've come up with innovative ways to solve problems in their communities. ""If a child doesn't have access to light then as soon as the sun goes down there is not time to do anything but sleep."" Kgatlhanye explains the design is to help poor households from using up candles which might otherwise have lasted an entire week. And the children can focus on their homework without worrying about disrupting the family dynamic. ""A child simply does not have the luxury of burning the midnight oil and practicing their math sums until 12 o'clock at night because [the family] have one candle which was meant to be rationed for the whole week."" After a six-month pilot phase earlier this year, the resourceful entrepreneurs are now distributing their 100% upcycled plastic bags to schools they've identified around their howetown of Rustenburg. The company has also teamed up with local individuals and corporates who are willing to cover the cost of the bags on behalf of the students. Depending on their donation, these so-called ""giving partners"" typically matched to a class, a grade or a school. Overcoming challenges . Launched last year, Repurpose Schoolbags has grown to today employ eight full-time staff -- six of which are women -- while its workshop produces around 20 bags a day. Yet, running such a business hasn't been without challenges. Kgatlhanye says there was a fair few failures in the beginning -- especially around training staff. Another problem the two young businesswomen faced early on was the lack of infrastructure for plastic recycling. But instead of letting this become a setback, the pair went about creating it themselves. ""We get [plastic] from landfill sites and collect it from schools that have come on board as ""Purpose textile banks"" and local schools run campaigns to get students to bring in plastic to be upcycled,"" Kgatlhanye explains. ""The plastic comes to our workshop where we process them into a textile, sew it up with industrial sewing machines and then we distribute,"" she continues. ""Seeing the kids believe that you can have waste and rubbish ... [that can be turned into] so much more -- you get kids being interested in recycling, whereas before you're in a rural area the concept of upcycling is a foreign concept. ""But when it comes in the form of a tangible product that helps you out -- now kids are picking up litter around the community,"" she adds. New year, new products . Looking ahead, the two have big plans for the future. Kgatlhanye says they are already hard at work as they prepare to take on an additional 12 employees to meet the growing demand for their bags, as well as introduce new products. She says: ""We've gotten a huge interest from other countries across Africa. We've also started with product development -- having other things for sale like conscience bags made out of the same material that corporates can then buy for their conferences and summits. ""We've also started development with a luxury brand to develop things like clutches. As part of the proceeds of the sales, we'll be able to finance and subsidize these bags.""

"(CNN) -- Nasty allegations have been haunting one of America's most iconic comedians, a man with a reputation for moral wholesomeness. For nine years, Bill Cosby has been accused of sexual assault by women who say they were the victims. Cosby has repeatedly said that the allegations are untrue. And he has never been prosecuted. But since 2005, a handful of women have made the claim. This year, those accusations resurfaced, and on Monday, a seemingly harmless post to Cosby's confirmed Twitter account turned them into a social media storm. In its wake, one of his accusers, Barbara Bowman, turned to the public once more with an article in the Washington Post. She also spoke to CNN's Don Lemon. Bowman claims she was drugged then raped, though she said she never saw drugs. ""I woke up out of a very confused state not in my clothes."" She said she knew her body had been touched without her permission. This occurred several times in the course of their contact, she said. She said to CNN that Cosby told her she had been drunk. Bowman was 17 and an aspiring actress when she met Cosby in 1985. She considered him to be her mentor. She spent time in his home, which included dinners with the star. She said the abuse began after she turned 18. Despite what she said was happening to her, she kept coming back. And Cosby and her agent financed her apartment in addition to supporting her acting ambitions, she said. She was afraid to talk to her agent about her concerns, and she felt Cosby's influence over her was too powerful. ""I was terrified of him,"" she said. ""As a teenager, I tried to convince myself I had imagined it. I even tried to rationalize it: Bill Cosby was going to make me a star and this was part of the deal,"" she wrote in her Washington Post article. In a Friday morning interview on CNN's ""New Day,"" Bowman said she went to a lawyer in 1989 to discuss legal action against Cosby but ""he laughed me right out of the office."" After that, Bowman said, she ""just gave up"" and moved on with her life. When another woman took legal action against Cosby years later, Bowman decided to lend her support, she said. ""I believe her because it happened to me,"" she said Friday. CNN reached out to Cosby's representative for comment on this article but has not yet heard back. When asked about the allegations Saturday during an interview on NPR, Cosby did not respond -- instead shaking his head ""no,"" according to the interviewer, Scott Simon. ""There are people who love you who might like to hear from you about this. I want to give you the chance,"" Simon said, to silence from Cosby. ""All right."" The Tweet . On Monday, the comedian -- or whoever was in charge of his social media -- put out a challenge with a jovial picture of Cosby in a cap: ""Go ahead. Meme me! #cosbymeme."" The Internet immediately reacted, but probably not in the way Cosby expected. ""Claire, have you seen my ... nevermind, found my raping hat!"" tweeted Trill Withers over the cap picture. ""My two favorite things (--) Jell-O pudding & rape,"" tweeted E.J. Coughlin over a photo of Cosby smiling. By nightfall, Cosby's original tweet had been pulled from the Web. But in the social media age, the rape allegations have stubbornly remained in the open. In late October, comedian Hannibal Buress bluntly attacked what he perceived as Cosby's ""smuggest old black man public persona"" by saying, ""Yeah, but you rape women, Bill Cosby, so turn the crazy down a couple notches. 'I don't curse onstage.' Well, yeah, you're (a) rapist, so I'll take you saying lots of m*****f*****s on 'Bill Cosby: Himself' if you weren't a rapist."" A couple weeks later, Cosby was booked on Queen Latifah's talk show, but the allegations reportedly gave the staff ""cold feet,"" according to TMZ. Cosby's booking was ""postponed at his request,"" the website reported in an addendum. (Cosby did do interviews with Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon without incident.) For years, Cosby has denied the rape allegations. In February, after Newsweek ran an interview with one of the purported victims, Tamara Green, Cosby's representative said, ""This is a 10-year-old, discredited accusation that proved to be nothing at the time, and is still nothing."" Nine years ago, when Green was interviewed by Matt Lauer on the ""Today"" show, his lawyer issued a statement: ""Miss Green's allegations are absolutely false. Mr. Cosby does not know the name Tamara Green or (maiden name) Tamara Lucier and the incident she describes did not happen. The fact that she may have repeated this story to others is not corroboration."" In the case of Andrea Constand, who sued Cosby in 2005 over an incident the year before, Cosby says the sex was consensual. Lawsuit airs allegations . At the time of Constand's lawsuit, Cosby had been in the news for a sexual affair once before. In 1997, a woman named Autumn Jackson claimed to be Cosby's love child. Cosby admitted to a relationship with Jackson's mother but denied paternity. Jackson was later convicted of extortion. However, it wasn't until Constand's lawsuit in 2005 that the comedian was accused of rape. Constand, a staffer for Temple University's women's basketball team, said in her suit that Cosby -- a Temple alum -- had become a mentor to her in the months since they met in 2002. In early 2004, he invited her to his house in suburban Philadelphia. Constand told Cosby she was feeling stressed and Cosby gave her three blue pills, which he described as ""herbal medication,"" according to her suit, which was posted on The Smoking Gun. Then, her ""knees began to shake, her limbs felt immobile, she felt dizzy and weak, and she began to feel only barely conscious,"" the suit continued. Cosby then gave her another drug, she said, and led her to the sofa, where she says she was sexually molested. ""When Plaintiff awoke, her clothes and undergarments were in disarray,"" the suit said. Constand later returned to her native Canada, where she reported the incident to police. Authorities in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, followed up with an investigation, but that February declined to press criminal charges due to a lack of evidence. Cosby's lawyer, Walter M. Phillips Jr., told CNN the allegations were ""utterly preposterous"" and ""plainly bizarre."" Cosby appeared surprised by the allegations. ""Looking back on it, I realize that words and actions can be misinterpreted by another person, and unless you're a supreme being, you can't predict what another individual will do,"" he told the National Enquirer in March 2005. Constand filed a civil suit in March 2005. Constand's lawyers said they found 13 Jane Doe witnesses with similar stories. However, Constand's suit was settled in November 2006, and the witnesses were never called. Terms have not been disclosed. The influence of Bill Cosby . Tarnished reputation . As Mark Whitaker's recent Cosby biography makes clear, the man has his demons. He had affairs while on the road and there have been bumps in his long marriage to his wife, Camille. But Whitaker, a former CNN managing editor, told CNN that he didn't feel comfortable airing the rape allegations. ""Basically, I knew that I was going to have to be very careful in what I said about his private life. I felt that way as a journalist and also for legal reasons,"" he said in an interview about the biography. ""In the case of these other allegations, basically because there were no definitive court findings, no independent witnesses, it didn't meet my standard for what I was going to put in the book."" ""I also was very aware that if I just did a she said-he said, and I printed allegations and denials without my own independent reporting, first of all it's not really in the spirit in the book, but also every person who then reviewed or reported on the book would be free to repeat those unconfirmed allegations just because they were in my book. And I just didn't feel comfortable being responsible for that."" Still, the rape allegations are always just a mouse click away. Not long after Constand's accusations hit the media, Tamara Green went public with her claims on ""Today."" A few months later, another Jane Doe, Beth Ferrier, also spoke out. Bowman came forward in 2006. Green and Bowman both gave interviews to Newsweek in early 2014. How all the controversy has affected Cosby personally is unknown. He's still scheduled to star in an NBC sitcom next year, and his skills as a comedian appear undiminished. Last year's concert movie, ""Far From Finished,"" earned mostly positive reviews, and his recent comedy tour has also received praise. But his once-sterling reputation has taken a hit. The Washington Post, Salon and The New York Times have all mentioned the rape allegations in stories, criticizing Cosby to varying degrees.","NEW: Cosby doesn't respond when asked about claims in an NPR interview .

"Thanks to technology, most of us now have the ability to shoot and edit long, high-quality videos on our phones, to upload them and to share them socially with everyone we know. But somehow, the hot social media trend is supershort video clips that are much closer to the GIF than to ""Citizen Kane."" In the past few years, a number of companies have launched around mobile video-sharing -- among them Viddy, Socialcam and Twitter's own looping, six-second Vine -- all vying for the unofficial title, ""the Instagram of video."" These apps have bred a unique category of content, from real-life moments such as blowing out birthday candles to short-form artistic creations that play with the medium. Now rumors are swirling that the next contender in this growing field will be Instagram itself. The popular photo-sharing app is expected to unveil a video-sharing feature Thursday during a press event at Facebook, its parent company, according to reports on TechCrunch, AllThingsD and other tech blogs. Not to be outdone, Vine seems to be readying some new features itself. The app's co-founders posted several Vines Wednesday that suggest users will soon have the ability to save drafts, splice bits of multiple Vines together and browse content based on categories and genres. So, a social-video turf war may be looming: Instagram vs. Vine. Facebook vs. Twitter. There's no word yet on what time limits or filters Instagram might place on a video-sharing tool. But on other platforms, the short clips have proven to be hugely creative, offering up bizarre snippets of art and fleeting peeks into people's lives. Vine correctly predicted that its shorter form would result in artsy videos along with the usual clips of celebrities and cute animals. ""The appeal (of) short video apps are well ... they're short!"" said Vine user Khoa Phan in an e-mail to CNN. ""You don't have to sit there for a long time to watch it.  And due to the length, you can watch many videos in (a) short time span."" ""Vine is immediate and to-the-point. The audience can view content quickly and consume multiple videos/stories in a short period of time,"" agreed Vine user Matt Willis, who believes the six-second limit ""forces the user to capture the defining elements of a story or concept."" Among the most successful clips on Vine are stop-motion videos, animations and how-tos. There are unexpected uses of the form, such as this Magic 6 Ball that cycles through a loop of answers. Many people turn the camera on themselves, giving new dimension to the overplayed ""selfie"" and fleshing out their Twitter persona with a real voice. As it turns out, a Vine is even the perfect length for covering a rodeo. Wyoming's Casper-Star Tribune uses the app heavily to round up the best performances at local rodeo events. What's impressive is how much can be packed into these short moments. Viddy and Vine enforce the shorter-is-better philosophy. Vine has had success with six seconds, a length Twitter settled on after testing videos between four and 10 seconds long. ""Posts on Vine are about abbreviation -- the shortened form of something larger,"" said Vine co-founder Dom Hofmann in the blog post announcing the app. ""They're little windows into the people, settings, ideas and objects that make up your life."" Viddy has gone the opposite direction, expanding its initial 15-second time limit to 30 seconds in response to interest from its users. Most people post clips of life events, scenes, pieces of conversation or fun action, said Jason Rapp, chairman of Viddy. ""Life keeps on going past six (seconds),"" he said in an interview with CNN. Vine has passed 13 million users. Earlier this month, Twitter released an Android version of its Vine app and it quickly became more popular than Instagram as a way to share media on Twitter, according to analytics site Topsy. As YouTube discovered long ago, there seems to be an insatiable hunger for online video. In May alone, Americans watched 41 billion videos online. The format also can be very lucrative, especially when the content is created for free by third parties. So how will all these services make money off small videos? Twitter could offer promoted Vines, like it does with tweets. But where people have finished reading a promoted tweet by the time they realize it's paid, clicking on a Vine and watching it requires an extra step that might lose people. Alternatively, Twitter could include ads in the videos themselves. YouTube has had success with ads inserted at the beginning, or middle, of a user-uploaded video. But the new crop of social video is so short that any ads would have to get their message across in just a few seconds. ""We're taking a more cautious approach because a traditional 15-30 second pre-roll is not going to work on a 30-second video,"" said Viddy's Rapp. It makes sense that Facebook would want to get in on the micro-video trend, and choosing Instagram as the tool for shooting and sharing these videos is natural. More than 100 million people use Instagram each month, uploading a staggering 40 million photos a day. Facebook, looking for ways to boost its mobile revenue, may eventually want to add short ads to Instagram videos. Meanwhile, fans of the short-video format will keep pushing the boundaries of what is possible. And the apps' social aspects  connect them to other like-minded people. ""Think of how Twitter has evolved. We have learned to fit often-complex statements into ... (140) characters,"" said Willis, the Vine user. ""Sometimes we chop bits out, or make up new words -- the rules are loose, and great Twitter users have a knack for exploiting this. Vine is heading in a similar way. The message needs to be immediate and without embellishment."" ""It's not just a video tool. It's a social community,"" said Vine user Hunter Harrison. ""The interaction is unbelievable. I've come to know people up there from all over the world ... people that I would now consider friends. It's actually pretty crazy how it has connected people.""","Micro-video apps like Vine have become hugely popular .

"Anti-NSA protesters took to the streets in cities across the United States on Thursday, using the Independence Day holiday to call attention to recent disclosures about the U.S. government's telephone and Internet surveillance programs. The movement, called ""Restore the Fourth,"" says the government programs such as Prism violate the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures without warrants. Specifically, it wants the National Security Agency's surveillance programs shut down. ""It's important that we speak up and let our elected officials know that our rights are being violated,"" said Kyle Smeallie, a protester in San Francisco. Online, popular websites such as Reddit showed support for the protesters by embedding Restore the Fourth images emblazoned with a hashtag. Study: Reddit used by 6% of adult Internet users . The grassroots, nonpartisan movement started a month ago when a group of people met on Reddit and decided to take action. ""It is something a lot of people care about. We're trying to get that narrative out there,"" said Sam Oslos, 23, one of the protest organizers. In the month following Edward Snowden's leaks about U.S. government programs collecting information from phone and Internet companies, some U.S. citizens seemed unsurprised and resigned to being monitored. According to a poll conducted by the Pew Research Center last month, 56% of Americans think the collection of telephone metadata is acceptable. The loosely coordinated activist group helped organize protests in more than 80 U.S. cities using online message boards and Twitter. There were demonstrations in New York City, Seattle, San Francisco, Denver, Chicago and Los Angeles. In Utah, protesters gathered near the new $1.5 billion NSA data center, which is scheduled to open later this year. The movement even spread overseas, where protesters showed up in front of the U.S. Consulate in Munich, Germany, donning Edward Snowden masks. In San Francisco, protesters walked from City Hall to the Embarcadero with signs that read ""Legalize the U.S. Constitution"" and ""I refuse to sacrifice my liberty for security."" Police estimated there were at least 250 people protesting, but said the group was growing larger throughout the day. ""The Fourth Amendment is there to protect us, but there comes a time when we have to step in and protect it,"" Parker Higgins, an activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said to the crowd. He later told CNN.com that getting people on the street was a way to let officials know that there are people who care about their privacy. Dawn Ligiter was at the San Francisco protests with her husband and two dogs.

"Imagine you're a hotel company with a score of brands that seem, well, dated. All the flash amenities of yesteryear seem irrelevant today. No one is using the minibar, room service is more trouble than it's worth, and all your young travelers gripe that there's no free wi-fi. What do you do? Answer: you build an entirely new product. Currently, there is a gap in the market for hotel rooms that fill the needs of the globetrotting generation of millennials. That won't be the case for much longer, though, as many of the world's largest hotel chains are gearing up to roll out new hotels aimed exclusively at tomorrow's travelers. Next year will see the arrival of Moxy (Marriott), Tommie (Commune Hotels) and Radisson Red, plus the expansion of already established hipster brands, like Aloft (Starwood), Andaz (Hyatt), CitizenM and Hotel Indigo (InterContinental Hotels). ""Every big company is looking at the same statistics we're seeing and saying, 'wow, we better do something for our millennial segment if we want to stay relevant,'"" says Ramesh Jackson, the vice president and global brand manager for Moxy Hotels. In order to appeal to a segment of traveler that is swiftly on the rise and soon expected to surpass Baby Boomers in their spending, hotels are having to majorly rethink their strategies and offerings. Space: Redefined and redesigned . In previous generations, privacy and personal space were key concepts in the hotel industry. As the world gets more social, however, that is decreasingly the case. Today's traveler doesn't want to sit alone at their desk. Rather, what they crave is community spaces. Radisson Red, for instance, has replaced many of the workplace staples found in more traditional rooms with more collaborative furnishings, like a sofa in place of a one-person armchair. ""Young people rarely sit at a desk and work. They like to work on their bed, or curl up on a chair, and we've had to design a room that facilitates that,"" says Gordon McKinnon, the chief brand officer for Carlson Rezidor -- the umbrella company for Radisson. Moxy, meanwhile, has introduced a range of ""zones"" in their lobby, including a quiet zone -- a Starbucks-style area where groups of people can work independently, though together -- and a video wall where guests can share their photos. ""This segment doesn't want to be confined to one enclosed space, and that's an idea that's been adopted by many brands,"" explains Nikhil Bhalla, vice president of equity research in lodging at FBR Capital Markets. Tech is king . When it comes to satisfying the insatiable techie hunger of today's traveler, new hotel brands know that wi-fi alone no longer cuts it. ""If you don't have high-speed, and if it's not free, you can forget about this target audience,"" says Jackson. The standard menu of seemingly endless cable channels also doesn't hold the allure it once did. ""They want to bring their own device, watch their own movies, and listen to their own music,"" notes McKinnon. To address this, Radisson Red is looking at ditching in-room televisions in favor of projectors and quality surround sound. The product counts . Even in the budget bracket, customers are expressing their desire for high-quality amenities, particularly when it comes to food, gym and bathroom offerings. As a result, the newer brands are rushing to form partnerships with respected brands, both on the global and local scale. Though considered an economy brand, Moxy is planning on partnering with cosmetics company Rituals for the bathroom amenities, and Tails, an award-winning drinks company that makes pre-mixed cocktails. ""Even for a brand in the economy tier, guests expect products they can recognize, not a watered-down shampoo,"" explains Jackson. The Airbnb effect . So what about that elephant in the room? You know, the king of the ""sharing economy"" -- Airbnb -- that has lured enough next-gen travelers to potentially put its valuation above Hyatt and the InterContinental? Will Millennials really give up their loyalty for Airbnb for the likes of Moxy and Tommie? Industry experts seem unperturbed. ""Airbnb isn't really that cheap,"" notes Jackson. ""And is someone who is using the Marriott hotel brand, and earning points towards their next stay, do they want to go to Airbnb? I really think they have a bigger effect on service apartments.""","Millennials will soon account for half of all business flights .
To cater to this segment, hotel chains are building entirely new brands .
Instagram walls, social media concierges and iPhone keys are newest hotel amenities .
Some think Airbnb although a notable upstart in the market, doesn't threaten traditional hotel chains ."
"(CNN) -- Federal health authorities recommended Monday that doctors suspend using Rotarix, one of two vaccines licensed in the United States against rotavirus, saying the vaccine is contaminated with material from a pig virus. ""There is no evidence at this time that this material poses a safety risk,"" Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg told reporters in a conference call. Rotarix, made by GlaxoSmithKline, was approved by the FDA in 2008. The contaminant material is DNA from porcine circovirus 1, a virus from pigs that is not known to cause disease in humans or animals, Hamburg said. About 1 million children in the United States and about 30 million worldwide have gotten Rotarix vaccine, she said. Rotavirus disease kills more than 500,000 infants around the world each year, primarily in low- and middle-income countries, she said. Before rotavirus vaccine became available, the disease was blamed for more than 50,000 hospitalizations and several dozen deaths per year in the United States, she said. The FDA learned about the contamination after an academic research team using a novel technique to look for viruses in a range of vaccines found the material in GlaxoSmithKline's product and told the company, Hamburg said. The drug maker confirmed its presence in both the cell bank and the seed from which the vaccine is derived, suggesting its presence from the early stages of vaccine development, she said. The FDA then confirmed the drug maker's findings. GlaxoSmithKline emphasized Monday that the pig virus is not known to cause illness in humans, saying ""it is found in everyday meat products and is frequently eaten with no resulting disease or illness."" ""No safety issue has been identified by external agencies or GSK,"" Thomas Breuer, the drug maker's chief medical officer, said in a written statement. ""GSK is committed to patient safety and to the highest manufacturing standards for all our vaccines and medicines. We are already working closely and discussing this finding with regulatory agencies around the world."" Another vaccine, RotaTeq, is made by Merck and was approved in 2006. There is no evidence that the Merck product is affected, Hamburg said. Both vaccines are given by mouth to infants to prevent rotavirus disease, which is marked by severe diarrhea and dehydration. Asked whether Merck would be able to meet the nation's demand, Merck spokeswoman Pam Eisele said, ""Obviously, we will work with the ... FDA to evaluate supply needs."" In the next four to six weeks, the drug agency will convene an advisory committee to make recommendations and seek input on the use of new techniques for identifying viruses in vaccine, Hamburg said. ""We're not pulling it from the market, we're just suspending its use during this period while we're collecting more information,"" she said. ""It should not be in this vaccine product and we want to understand how it got there. It's not an easy call and we spent many long hours debating the pros and cons but, because we have an alternative product and because the background rates of this disease are not so severe in this country, we felt that the judicious thing to do was to take a pause, to really ask the critical questions about what this material was doing in the vaccine, how it got there."" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, said ""a substantial amount"" of the DNA was found in the vaccine. But, he stressed, ""there is no evidence that it causes any disease. ... There is no evidence that it ever does anything."" The research group that discovered the contamination has asked not to be identified pending its paper's publication in a scientific journal, Hamburg said. Anyone who has already received a dose of Rotarix should switch to the Merck product for the next two doses, Hamburg said. Preliminary testing of the Merck product has found no evidence of the porcine circovirus 1 DNA, she said. Doctors should be able to tell parents which of the two products their children received, she said. Hamburg stressed that the suspension applies only to the United States. Public health officials in countries where the incidence of rotavirus is more severe may decide that the benefits of continuing to use the vaccine outweigh any concerns raised by the contamination, she said. ""Such a decision would be very understandable,"" she added. A similar virus, porcine circovirus 2, also does not cause disease in humans, but it does cause disease in its pig host, Hamburg said.","Doctors have been advised to suspend use of Rotarix rotavirus vaccine .
Another vaccine, RotaTeq, is still OK to use, officials say .
GlaxoSmithKline, maker of Rotarix, says the contamination is not harmful ."
"For many college students, landing a coveted internship is a feat. But making the most of the internship is the real accomplishment. With countless internship stories -- both dream scenarios and nightmares -- making the news lately, CNN chatted with interns past and present to find out what made their experiences so great. Let's be real. Free food galore, tantalizing perks and pay were definitely touted, but many students say these benefits are not the keys to a great internship. ""The best internship I ever had was in the district office for Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson,"" says former intern Anam Iqbal. ""While the internship was unpaid, the experience was priceless. I met many local political figures ... and many lifelong friends in the office."" So what's the secret? We got the skinny from interns past and present who say it's all in what you make of it. Here are five must-dos for a dynamite internship: . 1. Don't get caught up on money . Caitlin Beck, a rising senior at Fordham University, interned with MTV News -- for no pay -- this past spring. She's working now as a restaurant hostess to save money for the school year. She says writing for the MTV News RapFix blog and coordinating guest segments in the ""TRL"" studio outweighed the pay issue. ""It never really made me mad because I loved it,"" she says. ""When you're working somewhere like that, it validates you, so you almost can't get mad at them."" Beck received some financial assistance, including reimbursement for transportation, from Fordham to make her internship possible. Other interns also appeal to their schools for help making unpaid internships possible. While interning with Ashoka, a social entrepreneur think tank in Arlington, Virginia, Ayah Abo-Basha received a grant from her school's honors program -- and she says it's a situation with which many of her fellow interns can sympathize. ""I'm not spending money left and right,"" she says. ""All the interns bring their lunches."" Other students turned to part-time jobs. Iqbal had a morning job as a bank teller for the duration of her internship, and she coordinated her schedule with the bank and the congresswoman's office to make sure she could manage both commitments. When students are interning with start-ups or small companies, sometimes the employer just can't afford to pay extra hands. Hilda Adenjii, now a campus coordinator at Pace University, interned with event planning group DBD Social last summer. She was unpaid, but her employer covered all project expenses. When DBD Social merged with another company in the fall, they had the money to pay -- and they hired Adenjii back as a paid intern. ""Internships have become the new entry level,"" says Lou Gaglini, associate director for employer relations and recruiting at Boston College Career Center. ""Employers like to know you can hit the ground running."" 2. Embrace program structure . No student relishes the stereotypical picture of ""intern busy work"": sorting files, entering data -- feel free to insert your most dreaded office task here. In a structured internship program, there's considerably less room for busy work or (even worse) dead time. Interns' schedules are instead packed with meetings, events or seminars. Ayah Abo-Basha, a rising junior at Washington University in St. Louis, is interning this summer with Ashoka, a social entrepreneur think tank in Arlington, Virginia. ""I would say there's just enough structure,"" she says, specifically mentioning how weekly intern meetings can be educational seminars one week and informal socials the next. Graduate student Max Huleurt is the only intern in the production department of CBS's ""GameSpot,"" so he says he appreciates participating in activities with other CBS interns, such as the lunchtime ""Intern Olympics."" After socializing and enjoying the free event, he returns to his department, where he collaborates with salaried team members ""just like at a real job,"" he says. 3. Find your role and claim ownership of your projects . The word ""ownership"" pops up again and again when students describe internship successes. Tom Pae says this is what separates good internships from great internships. As a LinkedIn global sales operations intern, the majority of his time is spent collaborating with other interns on ""meaty"" projects and discussing his work with top leadership at the company. Alex Forss is at eBay for his second summer because he says he feels encouraged to pitch ideas and network with upper management. He's also seen his ideas successfully implemented later -- and he gets credit, too. ""It is a high-paying internship, but the responsibility is the most rewarding part of it,"" he says. ""I just led a conference call with a couple VPs on the phone. They let me do that."" But it's not just tech companies that value collaboration with interns. At CBS Interactive, Huleurt says he has unlocked the secret to internship happiness: knowing your work has value. ""It's not, 'Hey, intern, go get coffee,' or 'watch me do this,' "" he says. ""I have a very specific place, and it feels like a real job."" Shara Senderoff founded the website Intern Sushi to match students with good internship experiences. She says identifying your role is critical when later discussing an internship experience in job interviews or within a cover letter. ""If you can't say why your company is doing what it's doing, you don't know anything about the culture or the company,"" she says. ""You need to know the bigger picture of where your work fits in."" 4. Bond with your supervisor . At Ashoka, Abo-Basha says she doesn't have an ""intern supervisor"" -- she has an ""accountability partner,"" a full-time employee also in her field. ""You're a partner, not just a lowly intern,"" she says. Abo-Basha regularly meets with her accountability partner to give project updates, ask for advice on problems or learn about other opportunities within the company. But the best supervisors don't just lead -- they also inspire. When interning for Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, in 2010, Anam Iqbal took particular notice of the congresswoman's condolence card routine. Johnson sent personalized cards to the families and friends of recently passed Texans in her district. ""Working in the office made me realize mailing some things puts a smile on people's faces, whether you realize it or not,"" Iqbal says. Iqbal is now pursuing a master's degree in public administration -- a decision she says was inspired by her experience working with the congresswoman. ""Seeing her really care for her constituents made me think, 'I want to be like that. I want to be her,' "" she says. 5. Leave with talking points for your next job interview . A stacked resume isn't only good for netting internships; it should ideally highlight those experiences to lure full-time employers. Adenjii did exactly that after DBD Social. She parlayed her experience planning parties and coordinating events into a career as a campus coordinator at her alma mater, Pace University. There, she draws from her internship experience on a daily basis. ""My internship was a major thing I was asked about on job interviews,"" she says. Adjenjii says she frequently referenced her hands-on experience, while Iqbal says her internship was ""a conversation starter"" on her resume. Lauren Berger of InternQueen.com recommends keeping a list of tasks completed. ""It not only makes you feel accomplished, it helps you build your resume,"" she says. ""And on that list, I would pinpoint about two to three things you've learned personally as well as professionally."" Senderoff says above all else, students should remember internships are temporary -- they provide a chance to experiment with different responsibilities and work environments. ""A great internship is an exploration of what you don't want to do,"" she says. And once you know what you want to do, use the internship experience to jumpstart your next career move.

"She's a giant, and ancient, jigsaw puzzle: 300 bones, 19 bony plates and four vicious-looking spikes. The world's most complete stegosaurus skeleton -- nicknamed Sophie -- has gone on display at the Natural History Museum in London. At 5.6m long and 2.9m tall, the Stegosaurus stenops is roughly the size of a 4x4 vehicle -- though it predated such motors by 150 million years. Paleontologists at the museum have spent 12 months studying the skeleton, measuring, photographing and scanning it, as well as practicing putting it together. Now, a year after she arrived in London from the U.S., Sophie -- named after the daughter of a wealthy financier whose donation allowed the museum to acquire her -- is finally ready to make her public debut. The museum's lead dinosaur researcher, Professor Paul Barrett, said the stegosaurus was incredibly rare. ""Finding one as complete as this, where only the left arm and base of the tail are missing, is exceptional,"" he said in a statement. ""It's the only stegosaurus in the world that's anywhere near this complete. So it's an amazing find."" As well as drawing visitors in to the museum, Barrett said the specimen offered many interesting opportunities for research. ""Because the new skeleton is almost complete, and three-dimensional, we can do a lot of things that have not been possible until now, such as looking at how the leg muscles work or how the skull functions during biting. ""Thanks to this fossil, we can begin to uncover the secrets behind the evolution and behavior of this iconic but poorly understood dinosaur species."" Key to its importance is the fact that the fossil's skull bones are not fused together, allowing paleontologists the chance to experiment: ""It's almost like playing with a Meccano set,"" Barrett said. While they don't actually know whether it was male or female (despite the name), they can tell the dinosaur was relatively young when it died -- adult stegosaurus are known to have measured up to 9m in length. And although its spine plates and spiked tail mean it looks a little threatening, back when it was alive the stegosaurus would have been a vegetarian and a solitary creature. The first stegosaurus was discovered in Colorado in 1877 by paleontologist Othniel Marsh. The Natural History Museum's specimen was found at Red Canyon Ranch in Wyoming in 2003 -- it took 18 months of painstaking excavation work to free it from the ground it had lain in for so long.","World's most complete stegosaurus skeleton unveiled at Natural History Museum .

"Washington (CNN) -- A second grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer in the death of an unarmed black man once again had ripple effects that quickly spread from the streets on New York City to reach the halls of Capitol Hill. The decision not to indict a New York City police officer in the chokehold death of Eric Garner, a black man who was suspected of illegally selling cigarettes, came just nine days after another grand jury decided not to indict a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri in the death of black teenager Michael Brown. The news led to another night of protests in major cities nationwide, including Washington, D.C. President Barack Obama vowed not to ""let up"" in his efforts to ease racial tensions, and some Democrats tried to channel demonstrators' outrage in their reactions overnight and into Thursday morning. And it was a rare development that brought members of both parties together in calling for further investigation. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, said Thursday morning that the House should ""absolutely"" hold hearings to investigate Garner's death. ""We all have a lot of serious questions that need to be addressed and we need to understand what happened, why this decision was made,"" McMorris Rodgers said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""I would call for the House to have those hearings so that we can better understand. But we need to take action, appropriate action, making sure our local law enforcement have the training, that they're using appropriate force, whichâ€”I think we all recognize these are tragedies and it has raised a lot of questions."" Referring to Rodgers' call for hearings, House Speaker John Boehner said he would not ""rule that in or out,"" but said there are ""a lot of unanswered questions that Americans have, and frankly I have."" ""I do think that the American people deserve more answers about what really happened here and was our system of justice handled properly,"" Boehner said Thursday during a press conference. Black leaders in Congress quickly slammed the decision not to indict New York City police officer Daniel Pantaleo in Garner's death and called on the Department of Justice to investigate Garner's death. Rep. Marcia Fudge, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said Wednesday she was ""deeply disappointed"" in the decision not to indict Pantaleo in Garner's death and called the grand jury's decision ""yet another sad day for our country and our democracy."" ""In the span of two weeks, this nation seems to have heard one message loud and clear: there will be no accountability for taking Black lives. As an American, it is growing increasingly difficult to believe that there is justice for all,"" she said in a statement. ""Black lives do matter and our lives do hold value."" Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the black caucus' incoming whip who represents parts of New York City, called the grand jury's decision a ""stunning miscarriage of justice"" in a statement Wednesday and said the decision ""makes clear that equal protection under the law does not exist for all Americans."" And Jeffries said Thursday that the incidents should serve as a catalyst for a wide shakeup in how cases involving police misconduct and potential crimes should be prosecuted. ""We need to look at broader reform and whether these type of cases should be handled by independent, special prosecutors so that we can have some measure of fairness and a real full and fair investigation,"" Jeffries said on CNN's New Day. Jeffries called the altercation between Garner and the police officer, which was caught on video, a ""living breathing example of probable cause to indict."" Nearly a dozen times, Garner tries telling the officer that he can't breathe and Jeffries noted that Garner ""even put his hands up in the air,"" but Pantaleo ""continued to choke him."" Protests featuring slogans like ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" ""Black lives matter"" and now ""I can't breathe"" broke out again Wednesday in reaction to the Staten Island grand jury's decision as demonstrators called for justice for Garner and Brown, the black teenager who was shot by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson this summer. Amid outcry from Democrats on Capitol Hill and mostly silence from Congressional Republicans, two New York GOP Congressman defended the grand jury's decision Wednesday not to indict NYPD officer Pantaleo. Rep. Peter King thanked the grand jury on Twitter ""for doing justice"" and said later on CNN that he felt ""strongly"" the police officer should not have been indicted. RELATED: Rep. Peter King thanks Staten Island grand jury for 'doing justice' Rep. Michael Grimm, who represents Staten Island in Congress, called the grand jury decision ""fair and reasoned"" in a statement Wednesday and thanked the District Attorney in the incident for handling the grand jury case ""with the utmost integrity."" Staten Island is New York's whitest burrough and a majority of the grand jurors in the case were white. Grimm did not fare so well at the hands of another grand jury last spring, when he was indicted on tax and other fraud charges. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder heeded calls from Congressional leaders to launch a federal investigation and later Wednesday formally announced that the Justice Department is leading a civil rights investigation into Garner's death. President Obama had also weighed in Wednesday saying he had spoken with Holder and said ""we are not going to let up until we see a strengthening of the trust and a strengthening of accountability that exists between our communities and law enforcement."" Holder's announcement came after Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York joined members of the Congressional Black Caucus in calling on the Justice Department to investigate the Staten Island death. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand called the decision ""shocking"" and called Garner's death a ""tragedy that demands accountability."" ""Nobody unarmed should die on a New York City street corner for suspected low-level offenses,"" she said in a statement. U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch, Obama's nominee to succeed Holder as U.S. Attorney General, will lead the investigation into Garner's death. Sen. Chuck Schumer, also of New York, said he was confident Lynch will ""conduct a tough but fair investigation into the tragic death of Eric Garner."" Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican and would-be 2016 presidential contender who has specialized in reaching out to minority voters, blamed high taxes on cigarettes in the Empire State as partially to blame for putting police officers in ""a dangerous situation with bad laws."" .","NEW Speaker Boehner said American people deserve more answers in Garner's death .

"It's tricky business comparing the handful of smartwatches that been publicly unveiled so far -- an early wave in the growing flood of wearable tech products. The market is still defining what qualifies as a smartwatch, and the features available so far vary broadly from device to device. Samsung made the biggest splash so far Wednesday when it rolled out its Galaxy Gear, a souped-up watch with a simple camera, some decent storage space, voice controls and a single-core processor. But it lacks integration with Facebook and Twitter -- basic functions already adopted by some of its simpler competitors. And, if truth be told, some of the stars are still waiting in the wings.

"Iran, South Korea and Australia all booked a place in next year's FIFA World Cup following a dramatic final round of group matches in the Asian qualifying competition. A second-half goal from Reza Ghoochannejhad was enough for Iran to beat South Korea 1-0 in Ulsan, meaning Carlos Queiroz's team finished top of Group A. Victory saw Iran reach football's premier competition for the fourth time in its history, having previously played in the first round of the 1978, 1998 and 2006 tournaments. CNN correspondent Shirzad Bozorgmehr said Iranians took to the streets across their country to celebrate. He said that cars in the capital Tehran were draped in the Iranian flag and blowing their horns as their passengers shouted ""Iran, Iran."" ""This is the second national celebration in Iran in the last five days,"" said Bozorgmehr. ""Following the landslide victory of Dr. Hassan Rohani last Friday in the presidential elections, huge crowds poured into the streets of Tehran and other cities to publicly celebrate Dr Rohani's election victory."" In his first press conference on Monday, Rohani told reporters he planned to overhaul sports in a country where soccer is the most popular game. Despite defeat, South Korea still clinched the second automatic qualification spot as Uzbekistan fell agonizingly short against Qatar, winning 5-1 but finishing third in Group A on goal difference alone. After the match, South Korea coach Choi Kang-Hee revealed that he would be stepping down from his post - a surprise move at first glance, although Choi did say he would only take charge for the qualifiers when appointed in December 2011. Choi had been involved in an acrimonious war of words with Iran coach Carlos Quieroz ahead of the game and home fans hurled plastic water bottles and other items onto the pitch after taking offense at a gesture directed towards Choi by the Portuguese after the match. South Korea's loss meant Uzbekistan would qualify for the finals for the first time if it beat Qatar by six goals. But Uzbekistan fell behind in Tashkent when Abdulqadir Ilyas gave the 2022 World Cup hosts a shock first-half lead. World Sport Presents: Racism in Football . The home side bounced back in the second half, firing in five goals without reply, but the 5-1 final score was not enough to see Uzbekistan leapfrog South Korea. Uzbekistan will now play the third-place team in Group B - Jordan - over two legs. In Wednesday's final Asian qualifier, the Jordanians took third place in the group when beating Oman 1-0 in Amman - with Ahmad Ibrahim scoring a vital goal just before the hour. The result enabled the hosts to leapfrog their opponents in the group, with Jordan - seeking a maiden World Cup qualification - having trailed the Omanis by two points ahead of kickoff. The winner of the Uzbekistan-Jordan playoff will advance to a tie with the fifth-place team from the South American competition, with the winner qualifying for next year's finals in Brazil. A late header from substitute Joshua Kennedy gave Australia a 1-0 win over Iraq and sent the Socceroos to Brazil. Australia knew a win would be enough to qualify for a third consecutive World Cup, but anything less than three points would give Oman the chance to clinch an automatic qualification spot. With the score 0-0 at a rain-soaked ANZ Stadium, coach Holger Osiek drew the ire of the crowd by replacing star player Tim Cahill with Kennedy after 78 minutes. But Kennedy justified Osiek's bold decision by rising to meet Marc Bresciano's right-wing cross, beating Iraq goalkeeper Noor Sabri with a well-placed finish. Australia finished the Asian qualifying campaign second in Group B behind Japan.","Iran reach the 2014 World Cup with 1-0 win over South Korea .

"Apple is releasing its latest operating system for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch today. The system, iOS 7, will come installed on the new iPhone 5S and 5C models that go on sale Friday. Owners of some older Apple devices also can download it to replace their current systems. But should they? Before you jump in and upgrade, here's what you need to know about iOS 7. What is iOS 7? Apple's iOS is the software that controls all the basics of your gadget, including the look, feel, settings and hardware. iOS 7 is Apple's latest update to this system and its biggest change since iOS debuted six years ago. Siri leaves beta, enters manhood . What time is the iOS 7 download available? Developers have been testing early versions of the new operating system for months, but Apple made it available to the general public at 1 p.m. ET today. To see whether it is available, go to Settings > General > Software Update on your device, or visit iTunes on your computer. How is it different from what's already on my iPhone or iPad? Six years is a long time to wear the same look. Apple's iOS has received a major design overhaul in this version and now has a more streamlined, flat, abstract look. The typography is all new, and nice touches like transparency and subtle animations abound. There are also a handful of new features, though some are not available on all older devices. Here are a few of the biggies: . • A new time-saving control center slides up from the bottom of the screen for easy access to basic settings such as brightness and Airplane Mode. It has shortcuts for the flashlight, timer, calculator and camera. • An updated notification center now shows a summary of what you have in store for the day and details on the weather and your commute. • The camera adds a square-photo option and new filters, while the photos app drops the map view and sorts your images into events by date and location. • It adds AirDrop, a feature for people who use iCloud that makes it easier to move photos and files between computers and mobile devices. • The Siri voice-search tool adds an option for male voice, defaults to Bing for Web searches and pulls in results from Twitter and Wikipedia. • Multitasking looks different. The same double-click of the home button now zooms you out to show a carousel of mini versions of all your open apps. iOS 7 won't require a great deal of re-learning. The basic layout and functions are the same: The home screen is still a grid of icons, there's a dock with your favorite apps at the bottom, and the gestures you've become used to work the same. There will probably be some initial confusion as you struggle to re-identify all the new icons, but a proper upgrade should leave them all in the same spots they were in before. New iPhones: The reviews are in . Can I update my iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch? Although iOS is coming out the same time as a pair of brand new iPhone models, it can also be installed for free on some older devices. At the press event announcing the new models, Apple CEO Tim Cook said there were 600 million devices running iOS. Just because you have a year-old iPhone 5 doesn't mean you can't freshen it up with the latest operating system. Look for your device below to see whether it is eligible. • iPhone (original): No . • iPhone 3G: No . • iPhone 3GS: No . • iPhone 4: Yes. Does not include AirDrop, Siri or camera filters (you can add filters later in the photos app). • iPhone 4S: Yes. No AirDrop. • iPhone 5: Yes. Includes all new iOS 7 features. • iPod Touch: Only the 5th-generation iPod Touch can upgrade but will include all new iOS 7 features. • iPad (original): No . • iPad 2: Yes. No AirDrop, Siri, camera filters or square format, or Photos app filters. • iPad 3rd generation: Yes. No AirDrop or camera filters. • iPad 4th generation: Yes . • iPad Mini: Yes . Some of the cooler new features you may have heard about, like the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and the new camera tools -- slow-motion, burst mode and image-stabilization -- are available only on the new Phone 5S. Should I update? Just because your device is compatible doesn't mean it should be upgraded right away. Once you update your device to iOS 7, there is no going back to iOS 6 or whichever earlier iOS you were running. (Yes, there are unofficial ways to downgrade, but these are not recommended for regular iPhone and iPad users.) If you are not in a rush, wait a few weeks or months until Apple releases the first updated version of iOS 7. The early releases of the operation system can include bugs that should be addressed with subsequent iOS 7 updates. Let other eager people spend the next few weeks finding and reporting these issues so you don't have to deal with them. Older devices can experience frustrating performance issues when upgraded to a new OS. The iOS 7 software was designed specifically for the hardware that's faster than your trusty old iPhone 4. If your device is anything older than the most recent generation, it might suddenly slow down, and battery life can suffer. This should not be as much of a problem for newer devices, such as the iPhone 5, 4th generation iPad and iPad Mini, or the latest iPod Touch. If you are worried about performance issues, skip the update. Updating immediately is recommended only for tech-savvy early adopters who are comfortable with the risks. Are there any downsides of not updating? Immediately, not much. You won't have the new features to play with, but your phone will continue to work as it always did. In the long run, there could be a few drawbacks. Apple has been pushing developers to update their apps to be iOS 7 compatible. The updates can be as minor as changing the look of an icon or as major as adding all new features. Many developers may stop updating and supporting older versions of their apps as they move their focus to iOS 7. That means eventually, you could be stuck with out-of-date (or even non-working) versions of your favorite apps. I'm going for it! How do I upgrade? 1. Back up:  Before you make the leap, it is very important that you back up your iPhone or iPad. There is always a small chance your device could be wiped clean in the upgrade process, so make a full backup of everything. To back up, plug your device into your computer, open iTunes, and if it does not start backing up automatically, click the ""Back Up Now"" button. If your photos are not set to back up automatically, use Image Capture or iPhone on a Mac and Windows Explorer on a Windows PC to make copies of all your pictures. Another option is to skip the cord and back up to iCloud over Wi-Fi. On your device, go to Settings > iCloud > Storage & Backup. Tap the ""Back Up Now"" button. 2: Download the new iOS: You can get the update by plugging into a computer and opening iTunes (this is the faster option) or over a Wi-Fi connection directly to your phone. If iTunes doesn't automatically ask whether you'd like to upgrade when you plug in, click ""Check For Updates"" in the Summary tab. It will do the rest automatically. From your phone, go to Settings > Software Update and click the install button. Make sure your phone is fully charged and connected to a Wi-Fi network, not your cellular network.","Apple's latest operating system for iPhones and iPad was released Wednesday .

"(CNN)If there's anything serving notice on the traditional bricks and mortar department store, then it's China's internet and e-commerce statistics. This year the number of internet users going online with a mobile device, such as a smartphone or a tablet, overtook those doing so on a personal computer for the first time. And not surprisingly, e-commerce is booming. ""One in two online citizens in China are now buying online. And that penetration is going up,"" said Shen Haoyu, CEO of JD.com China's version of Amazon.com and e-commerce giant Alibaba.com's biggest competitor. Only a few short decades ago, China had practically no consumer culture, but today millions of consumers daily buy computers, clothing and even fresh seafood online. ""In the future, e-commerce, the main battlefield will be on the mobile devices. By next year the overall smartphone users will exceed that of PC users. So you can see that mobile commerce is definitely the number one trend,"" said Yu Gang, CEO of Yihaodian, a Chinese online grocery business. While internet penetration can be problematic for developed markets where people are used to high street shopping, in China e-commerce entrepreneurs have little to worry about. With China's total number of internet users up 2.3 percent to 632 million in 2014, according to figures from the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC),  the country has the largest number of online users in the world. The data showed that 527 million people of this total went online via a mobile phone and that the number of online shoppers in the first half of 2014 surged by 42%. China is currently the largest smartphone market in the world, having overtaken the US in 2012. By 2018, it will account for more than 33% of the estimated 1.8 billion smartphones likely to be shipped that year, according figures from IDC. E-commerce in China is dominated by Alibaba but is closely followed by JD.com which is more than 17% owned by its arch-rival Tencent Holdings. The big movers in mobile services in China at the start of 2014 were music, video, gaming, and group-buying, all of which shot up by double-digit increments. The fastest growing services were travel booking, up 65.4%. Mobile payment, which increased 63.4%, and online banking, which showed a rise of 56.4% rise.","China is the fastest growing e-commerce geography in the world .

"With the holiday toy shopping season here in full swing you may want to think twice about a couple of the items that may be on your child's list. That's because toy-related injuries are on the rise according to a new report. A study published in the latest edition of Clinical Pediatrics shows the injury rate has increased almost 40% in the United States. That's looking at statistics from emergency departments collected between 1990 to 2011. Over 3 million children were treated in emergency departments  for a toy-related injury. In 2011 alone, that translates to a child getting hurt every 3 minutes. A little over half of the injured is a young child under the age of six. Researchers found the number one toy causing the problems for kids are ride-on toys like foot-powered scooters. ""We know that's an underestimate,"" said Dr. Gary Smith. He's the lead researcher on the study and the Director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital.  ""We know that those numbers are increasing. So it's a call to action. We really do have a lot more work to do to provide safe toys for children"" When asked about the study's limitations, Smith says it  ""only look(s) at children treated at American hospital emergency departments."" Missing are the numbers from urgent care centers and doctors offices, or those that don't seek any medical care at all. Toy-related deaths were also left out of the study database. Most injuries are not that severe according to the latest numbers from the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Smith emphasizes that depending of the age of the child, there are different types of injuries for different. ""For younger children, kids under 5, they spend most of their time in the home, and so it's toys found indoors, in the home, that are the major source of injury."" For children under 3, it's choking hazards. Toys with small parts are always a causes for concern for the little ones. And recalled toys can be a problem. Smith suggests you check Recalls.gov to make sure the toy you are picking out is not defective. As for older adolescents, foot-powered scooters or ""kick"" scooters are a major source of injury. With the introduction of the Razor scooter in 1999, these light-weight, foldable two-or-three-wheeled toys quickly became popular and they also quickly became a bulk of the increase in toy-related injuries according to researchers. If you do chose to buy your child a scooter this holiday season,  Smith suggests parents buy a helmet as well.  He also tells parents to talk to the child about playing in an area that is far away from car traffic. And if the child is under 8, make sure there's an adult to watch over them when they play. These are the same guidelines the Razor scooter company suggests on its own website. The company also suggests riders use elbow and kneepads.","Study: Toy-related injury is rising in American children treated at U.S. emergency departments .

"(CNN) -- It feels like a rerun of the Orange Revolution. Similar to late 2004 when hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians took to the streets to protest what they saw as a fraudulent presidential election, mass demonstrations have been taking place ever since the government in Kiev suspended an association and trade agreement with the European Union some days ago. No less than back then, observers inside and outside the country are stunned by the civic force unleashed. Across the country, Ukrainians have been gathering for Euro Maydans, coined after the Kiev square that is the epicenter of protests now as it was then. Social networks, independent media and street talk are again abuzz with minute-by-minute news, appeals for nonviolence, help offered to protesters and humor ridiculing the powers that be. Ukraine protests grow as president responds . Ukrainians also pin their anger -- and their hopes -- on largely the same protagonists as nearly a decade ago. There is the government of President Victor Yanukovich, whose rigged election in 2004 and rejection of the EU accord now, both times with backing from Russia, blatantly ignored the will of many Ukrainians. These, in turn, rally behind an opposition led by a motley crew composed of boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, nationalists and, from her prison cell, the erstwhile Orange icon Yulia Tymoshenko. And as back then, the government has started to peddle back, and indications now are that the protesters may succeed with their demands. Yet not all is dÃ©jÃ  vu, and the stakes now seem even higher than during the Orange Revolution. Many in Ukraine feel today that they have reached a final junction. They do not want to miss what may be the last opportunity in many years to come for a principal, some even say civilizational, choice between Europe and Russia, democracy and dictatorship, sovereignty and subordination, prosperity and poverty, modernity and mayhem. Indeed, the contrast between what Ukraine can expect from her Western and Eastern neighbors could not be starker. Opinion: Beware Russia's power play . The EU has, over several years, negotiated the most comprehensive association and deep free trade agreements ever, and it is ready to sign these with Ukraine. They require the country to adopt hundreds of EU laws, regulations and standards, and necessitate much-needed reforms of Ukraine's often dysfunctional political, legal and state institutions. In return, the EU would abolish visas for Ukrainian citizens and open its common market of 500 million consumers to Ukrainian companies, resulting in a considerable boost to the country's GDP and prosperity. While promising to affiliate Ukraine closely with the EU, to reinforce its independence and to benefit its democracy, rule of law and market economy in the long-run, the agreements fall short of a full membership perspective for the country, and they contain very limited assistance to accomplish the painful process of reforms required. Most importantly, however, the EU has been reluctant to include with its offer short-term support to Ukraine's battered economy and finances. Russia, on the other hand, has used the dire need of Ukraine for immediate cash injections to promote its own integrationist project, the Eurasian Union. This is Vladimir Putin's attempt to bring back former Soviet republics under the Kremlin's hegemony and to restore its erstwhile status as a world power, and it is to be fully functional by 2015. This anti-EU, which currently comprises only Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia, does not demand political, economic and social modernization but is content with the same autocratic and oligarchic status quo that Russia herself preserves. In return, current and would-be members are lured with Russian political backing, financial subsidies and security guarantees, while countries opting against are threatened with debilitating sanctions. In either case, Russia effectively undermines the independence and statehood of its smaller neighbors. Ukraine, the largest, most strategic and highly symbolic among Russia's neighbors, has experienced this arsenal of Russian sticks and carrots for years -- and the more massively, the closer it moved to signing its EU association and trade agreements. Faced with this choice, the Ukrainian government and society have clearly grown apart. The former gave in to Russian pressures, mainly drawn by the short-term prospect of financial aid offered by Moscow and only concerned with preserving its political power. The latter has increasingly understood that a free, democratic and prosperous Ukraine is possible only in ever closer, and one day full, integration with the EU. It is this understanding that manifests itself in the demonstrations across the country. It is now on the EU to seize the moment. It must be no less proactive than it was during the Orange Revolution and engage the Ukrainian government and the protesters in a national dialogue for a way out of the current impasse. It must clearly state that Ukraine has a perspective of EU membership as per its own founding documents, and it must ready the same support -- political, financial and institutional -- that it has provided to other new democracies on their way to the EU. It must mobilize, directly and through the IMF, the resources for Ukraine to weather its imminent financial collapse, and it must shield the country from likely Russian retaliation, whether economic sanctions, political meddling or worse. Hundreds of thousands of courageous Ukrainians have handed their country, and Europe, a second chance. It may be the last, and it must not be wasted.

"Thinner. Lighter. Faster. That's what Apple promises in its newest iPad, which also has a new name: the iPad Air. The company rolled out the fifth generation of its market-leading tablet Tuesday. Among its new features, the iPad will weigh 1 pound, down from 1.4 pounds. It's 20% thinner and 28% lighter than the current fourth-generation iPad. The iPad Air will have the same 9.7-inch screen as previous iPads and pack the same A7 processing chip that's in the iPhone 5S. That will make it 72 times faster than the original iPad, according to Apple Senior Vice President Phil Schiller. ""This is our biggest leap forward ever with a full-size iPad,"" Schiller said. The iPad Air will go on sale November 1. Prices will start at $499 for a 16GB Wi-Fi-only model and go up to $629 for a 16GB with 4G LTE connectivity. Schiller also announced a revamped iPad Mini starting at $399. It will be available later in November in silver or space gray and will pack a speedy A7 processor and the same high-resolution ""Retina display"" as bigger iPads. Apple passes Coke as world's 'top brand' The older iPad Mini is still around and will cost $299. And the full-size iPad 2, launched in 2011, is still available for $399. Apple took another new direction on Tuesday, announcing that the newest version of its Mac operating system, OS X Mavericks, is available now for download and will be free. Selling Mac software has never been a huge money-maker for Apple, and the price of OS X upgrades had been dropping in the past few years. The move can be seen as a shot at Microsoft, which relies more heavily on revenue from sales of Windows. New MacBook Pro and MacBook Air laptops also were rolled out and go on sale immediately. They get the usual incremental updates: better graphics, longer battery life, faster flash storage and next-generation Wi-Fi. Apple also announced that both iWork and iLife, their suites of office and creative software, are now free with the purchase of every new Mac. And the super-powerful Mac Pro, the desktop computer geared toward high-end graphics and video editing, finally got a price point -- $2,999 -- and will be released before the end of this year, according to Apple's Phil Schiller. The Pro was designed in California and assembled in the U.S. across 20 states. The pieces are probably manufactured out of the country and shipped to the U.S. for the building stage. Apple's not the only tablet manufacturer with news this week. Microsoft officially launched its Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 tablets on Tuesday morning, as did Nokia with its own Windows 8 device, the Lumia 2520. The Surface 2 starts at $449, while the more powerful Surface Pro 2 will start at $899. Is Apple's iPhone 5C a flop? The Lumia 2520 costs $499 and is Nokia's first full-sized tablet. It's also Nokia's first big product rollout since it was announced that Microsoft was going to purchase part of the company. But as rivals catch up to the once-dominant iPad and the marketplace gets flooded with new tablets, it's getting harder for competitors to set themselves apart. ""Tablets are a maturing market; there's not much competitors can do to differentiate at this point,"" said Sarah Rotman Epps, a senior analyst at Forrester Research. ""Replacement sales are growing much, much faster than new sales worldwide,"" she added. ""You're competing for customers you already have."" At Tuesday's event, Cook took a swipe at competitors with a reference that seemed most aimed at Microsoft's hybrid Surface tablets. ""They chased after netbooks,"" he said. ""Now they're trying to make PCs into tablets and tablets into PCs.""

"Conditions in Indian sterilization clinics are under renewed scrutiny after a doctor was removed from his job for using a bicycle pump to inflate women's abdomens during the procedure. Health officials in Odisha state have launched an investigation after reports that bicycle pumps were used on 56 women undergoing sterilization surgery at a government-run community health center in Banarpal, Angul district, Friday. The physician was identified as Dr. Mahesh Chandra Rout, a retired surgeon who carried out work when required for the clinic, said Odisha Health Secretary Arti Ahuja. She said he would no longer be called on to work for the clinic, and could face charges as a result of the inquiry. When contacted by CNN, Rout refused to comment. Equipment missing . Ahuja said the medical equipment that should have been used in the procedure -- a carbon dioxode insufflator -- had been provided to the clinic, and investigators would try to determine why it was not used. But Sachin Ramachandra, a health official in the district where the procedures took place, said inquiries revealed the insufflator was missing, which is why the bicycle pump had been used instead. A health official who did not wish to be named told CNN that the use of bicycle pumps in sterilization surgery was widespread. In the wake of the incident, state health officials issued a directive that all sterilizations must be carried out according to correct protocols. 'Might burst abdomen' In sterilization surgery, the patient's abdomen needs to be inflated to allow room to move surgical instruments. Dr. Naresh Trehan, the chief medical officer at the Medanta medical institute in New Delhi, told CNN that using a carbon dioxide insufflator allows a doctor to measure and calibrate the amount of pressure placed on the abdomen. Using a bicycle pump -- a method Trehan said he was alarmed to hear about -- is highly dangerous. ""If you use a bicycle pump, you don't know how much air you're pumping in and you might burst the abdomen,"" he said. Dr. Vidhyadhar Sahu, the chief medical officer for Angul district, said none of the 56 women who underwent surgery on Friday reported any problems. Deaths 'almost inevitable' For decades, in a bid to curb population growth, the Indian government has run a nationwide sterilization program. Particularly in poorer, rural areas, where access to other forms of contraception is limited, sterilization is a popular option. Women are paid to have the operations, and doctors are given incentives to perform them. But health advocates claim that conditions at the mobile clinics where the procedures are often performed, known as sterilization camps, are sometimes unsanitary and dangerous. Last month, a surgeon was arrested on charges of negligence and attempted culpable homicide in the deaths of a dozen women who had undergone sterilization operations at a mobile clinic in Chhattisgarh, one of India's most impoverished states, which borders Odisha. Dr. R. K. Gupta, assisted by a team of fellow medical professionals, operated on 83 women in a span of six hours, including 12 who subsequently died. Government guidelines stipulate doctors should conduct no more than 30 sterilization surgeries a day. Gupta blamed the deaths on drugs given to the women after the surgeries. Kerry McBroom, a New Delhi-based advocate with the Human Rights Law Network, told CNN at the time of the deaths that they were ""almost inevitable... given the unsafe, unethical and unhygienic conditions that persist throughout India in these camps."" ""You might find that there is no electricity, there is no running water, there is not enough staff in these facilities,"" she said.

"If investment banker Antonio Weiss wins Senate confirmation as a Treasury under secretary, he'll walk away with a parting payment of up to $21 million. Talk about a win-win. The financial services firm Lazard, where Weiss is the global head of investment banking, has agreed to pay him about $16 million in unvested income early and give him between $1 million and $5 million in deferred compensation, according to financial disclosure records he filed with the government ethics office. The disclosures are likely to add fuel to the fire being stoked by liberal Senate Democrats who are bucking President Barack Obama by opposing Weiss' nomination -- a charge led by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. She argues in part that there are already too many ""Wall Street executives dominating the Obama administration, as well as the Democratic Party's, overall economic policymaking."" The practice of Wall Street executives cashing out early when they take government jobs drew criticism during last year's confirmation hearings for the man who might be Weiss' new boss, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. When Lew left Citigroup in 2008 and later joined the State Department, he made somewhere between $250,000 and $500,000 in early stock payouts. Deferred compensation and vested stock options were originally designed to keep talented employees from jumping ship. That's left people like Heather Slavkin Corzo of the AFL-CIO asking, ""Why are we paying these people to leave?"" ""Unless it's just a backdoor way to pay off newly minted government regulators,"" she added, ""it's hard to see how it's in shareholders' interest."" In fact, the practice led AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka to write to seven Wall Street players last month. In a letter to Weiss' firm, he wrote, ""Why is it in the interest of Lazard to incentivize such departures? Surely Lazard does not expect favorable government treatment from its former executives."" And that, of course, is exactly what critics fear. ""The question is why would a company give an executive a special financial reward as they're about to take a government position. Some people say these policies encourage public service, but we worry that they give financial insiders even more sway over the government. In some ways, these companies are ensuring that they'll have friends in high places,"" said Michael Smallberg of the Project On Government Oversight, a government watchdog group. Smallberg authored a report last year that found a number of major corporations financially reward employees who go through the revolving door. Some Weiss supporters say his appointment isn't a typical revolving door scenario because Lazard isn't regulated by the recent Wall Street reforms aimed at reining in practices that led to the financial crisis. A Lazard spokeswoman said Weiss declined to comment and that the firm does not discuss compensation. Earlier this week, The New York Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin defended the practice writing, ""Wouldn't it be nice if all private sector businesses offered their employees the opportunity to pursue public service work ... without giving up income or other benefits that they may have earned? Of course it would be. Well, that's what the compensation policies of many of the firms in question do. Frankly, it should be encouraged more broadly."" But to watchdogs like Smallberg these policies ""show how the revolving door is literally written into the pay plans of big companies that already have an advantage over public interest groups when it comes to lobbying and making their voices heard.""","Investment banker Antonio Weiss has been picked for a Treasury under secretary post .

"(CNN) -- Dubai sent investors reeling Thursday after asking creditors to freeze the debt repayments of one of its biggest holding companies, Dubai World. The announcement came after the market close on the eve of the Eid holiday and Thanksgiving in the U.S., leaving traders' hands tied over their exposure to investments in the Emirate. Shares dropped in London and Europe as bankers struggled to gauge the implications of the debt freeze without additional guidance from Wall Street. With very little information being distributed from Dubai, the market has been left to question the motives of ruler Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum and the financial future of Dubai World and its huge portfolio. So what happened? Late Wednesday, the government of Dubai issued a statement saying it had authorised the Dubai Financial Support Fund to ""spearhead the restructure of Dubai World with immediate effect."" The first step, it said, was to ask all providers of financing to Dubai World and Nakheel to ""standstill"" its debt repayments until at least May 30, 2010. It added, to the market's surprise, that the proceeds of a $5 billion bond issue raised hours earlier wouldn't be used to bail the company out. Odd timing wasn't it? Dubai's decision to release its statement just before the Eid holiday in the Middle East, and on the eve of Thanksgiving in the U.S., provoked consternation. ""Dubai have certainly picked their moment to finally own up to a need to restructure their debt. I would imagine the news has ruined a few Thanksgiving dinners today,"" David Morrsion, a strategist at GFT told the Financial Times. Read CNN's John Defterios' take on the Dubai debt fears . How did the markets react? Banking stocks led equity markets lower in London and Europe as traders moved to distance themselves from a potential debt hole in the Middle East. Technical problems in London halted trade for some time, providing further frustration for traders with exposure to Dubai World's lenders. What is Dubai World & Nakheel? Described on its Web site as ""Dubai's flag bearer in global investments,"" Dubai World is a holding company with stakes in everything from ports to real estate and transport. It includes the world's largest privately held real estate company Nakheel, which is the mastermind behind such architectural feats as the man-made residential islands, ""The Palm Islands"" and ""The World."" Dubai World also invests in global markets through its investment arm Istithmar World, which boasts a ""global footprint"" in finance, capital, leisure, aviation and other business ventures. How severe is the debt? Dubai World is said to account for some $59 billion of Dubai's $80 billion debt burden. Nakheel had been due to pay a $3.5 billion convertible loan which expires on December 14. More debts were due to be repaid next year. ""This is not just a couple of billion story,"" Turker Hamzaoglu, EMEA economist at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research told CNN. ""For instance, Dubai has to service $10 billion including the Nakheel debt in December and $15 billion U.S. dollars by the end of 2010,"" he added. How much damage has the announcement done? That's incalculable at this stage. Markets in the Middle East and the U.S. don't open until next week so the full impact won't be known until then. It also depends on Dubai's next move. The surprise announcement has shaken confidence in the Emirate as a place to do business. ""The key here is the communication of this strategy. I guess everybody is on the same page regarding the need for consolidation in Dubai and for the region. But the only market-positive implication would be if this comes with a clearly open and a predictable way,"" Hamzaoglu said. ""The problem is, here we have a lack of transparency and all these policy reactions are either coming at the last minute, or for example, the recent one just before the long holiday."" ""I think this is going to shake some investor confidence which may not be reversed as quickly as people expect. So they have to be careful,"" he added. Who will bail them out? Abu Dhabi has been a lucrative source of funding for its neighbor. The $5 billion bond issue was take up by UAE banks. The question now is whether it will continue to give its backing to its debt-laden neighbour. It may have the money to do so, but does it have the will? What comes next? Ideally, the market wants guidance as to Dubai's debt strategy. It has said that the Dubai World debt freeze is the first stage of a restructuring plan. Investors want to know what comes next. Right now, the region is seen as a risky bet for nervous investors. Hamzaoglu says there are other options for those who want to back similar markets. ""From an investor perspective, if you want to still play for the global backdrop of oil prices, etc. there are some other markets, say Brazil or Russia, that investors can be interested in, rather than taking this high risk for the region,"" he said.","Dubai stuns global investors by calling for a debt ""standstill"" on Dubai World and Nakheel debts .

"(CNN) -- There is nothing wrong with professional athletes expressing their opinions about social or political issues. Just because you slip on a helmet or swing a racquet doesn't mean you don't have the right to voice an opinion on politics, the economy, faith or any other issue in America. However, Charles Barkley's recent comments about the Ferguson grand jury decision and the subsequent unrest across the nation aren't just off-the-cuff comments from an athlete waxing political during an interview. For the last several years Barkley has fashioned himself as some type of hard-truth-telling cultural critic -- especially on issues of race in America. What his Ferguson commentary makes obvious is that he's just an uninformed rich guy who is given way more credibility than he deserves when discussing racial and political issues in America. In an interview on a Philadelphia sports radio station, the conversation meandered from sports to politics as Barkley began to express his frustration with looters and violence in the wake of the Ferguson grand jury decision to not indict Officer Darren Wilson for the death of Michael Brown. Barkley's comments that those people damaging businesses and attacking police are ""scumbags"" is pretty boilerplate stuff that most Americans, including peaceful protesters, would agree with, even if different words were used. It was when Barkley began his riffs on race that things went out of bounds. ""The true story came out from the grand jury testimony,"" Barkley said, citing that ""three or four witnesses, who were black, said exactly what the cop said."" In reference to Eric Garner's death at the hands of New York police he went even further. ""When the cops are trying to arrest you, if you fight back, things go wrong. I don't think they were trying to kill Mr. Garner. He was a big man and they tried to get him down."" And then he followed up with generalized comments that there are lots of black criminals out there and that essentially black people are the cause of most of their problems with white police. In an interview with CNN, Barkley said, ""We as black people, we have a lot of crooks. We can't just wait until something like (the Brown shooting) happens. We have to look at ourselves in the mirror."" ""There is a reason that they racially profile us in the way they do. Sometimes it is wrong, and sometimes it is right,"" Barkley said. The problem with these statements isn't just that they are misleading -- 16 out of 29 witness statements said that Mike Brown had his hands up to surrender, in direct conflict with Darren Wilson's story; and police used a banned choke hold on Eric Garner, a measure that was known to cause death -- but that Charles Barkley is uniquely and astoundingly unqualified to discuss issues of race, law and police violence. If property damage makes you a scumbag, then how would we describe someone who, in the 1990s, got into bar fights, throwing a man face first through a store window? (Barkley, who said he was provoked, was fined and sentenced to community service in that incident.) If black folks need to take more responsibility how would you describe a black man who drives drunk, runs a red light and explains to police that he was rushing home to have sex with the woman in the passenger seat? If those actions make you a scumbag, or show lack of responsibility, then Barkley should let it be known he's talking about himself. Because he has been charged with crimes over the course of his career but somehow he never ended up shot, or dead, and has spent three days in jail. Charles Barkley's personal failings don't disqualify him from social commentary, but his hypocrisy does. Charles Barkley is a very, very rich man, whose fame and celebrity have protected him from the kind of hostility and harassment from the police that thousands of other Americans, especially African-Americans, experience every day. It's easy for Charles Barkley to lecture protesters and looters and mourning families about how to deal with anger. But most Americans can't defuse a ""tense"" police situation with the aid of celebrity. Nevertheless, Barkley's hypocrisy about his own privilege and lack of real knowledge about Ferguson wouldn't be so bad if media outlets didn't keep giving him major opportunities to express his views. This preposterous phenomenon is captured perfectly by his ""NBA on TNT"" co-host Kenny ""The Jet"" Smith in an open letter to Barkley released on Wednesday. ""However, what I consistently find interesting is how writers and media members view your insights in politics, and now race relations, with the same reverence as your insights in sports. ""It's not that you shouldn't ever have an opinion, but you are often quoted alongside the likes of Al Sharpton and even President Obama. I would hope that Sharpton or President Obama would never be referenced with you when picking the next NBA Champs! ""The body of work that our Black Civil Rights leaders put in by planning, executing and activating does not justify you being in the conversation."" In other words, Charles Barkley gets a huge forum to talk about cases like Ferguson and the killing of Trayvon Martin because he's black and famous, not because he's informed, or credible or even representative of any segment of the population. And while that might make for entertaining television, it certainly doesn't amount to social criticism anyone should take seriously. Whether it was Serena Williams on rape, or Reggie White on Asians, or Luke Scott on Obama, athletes say offensive or dumb things about politics and culture all the time, but analysts and journalists always give them a soft landing. This is usually done by pointing out that said athlete is a Hall of Famer, or was great in some playoff series or donates to charity. Charles Barkley doesn't deserve that soft landing anymore. If networks are going to lob him easy questions about larger social issues, he should have to defend what he says just like any other guest. But if his comments over the last few years are any indicator, he probably can't. In other words, if Sir Charles wants to post up in the world of politics about Ferguson, then he needs to get more informed, more prepared and more connected to what he's talking about. There's no room for him in the court of public opinion when lives, property and the health of our democracy are at stake.

"(CNN)  -- Paul Newman, the legendary actor whose steely blue eyes, good-humored charm and advocacy of worthy causes made him one of the most renowned figures in American arts, has died of cancer at his home in Westport, Connecticut. He was 83. Paul Newman's handsome face and solid acting made him a popular and respected film star. He died Friday, according to spokeswoman Marni Tomljanovic. Newman attained stardom in the 1950s and never lost the movie-star aura, appearing in such classic films as ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"" ""Exodus,"" ""The Hustler,"" ""Cool Hand Luke,"" ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" ""The Sting"" and ""The Verdict."" He finally won an Oscar in 1986 -- on his eighth try -- for ""The Color of Money,"" a sequel to ""The Hustler."" He later received two more Oscar nominations. Among his other awards was the Motion Picture Academy's Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. ""Paul took advantage of what life offered him, and while personally reluctant to acknowledge that he was doing anything special, he forever changed the lives of many with his generosity, humor, and humanness,"" said Robert Forrester, vice chairman of the actor's Newman's Own Foundation. ""His legacy lives on in the charities he supported and the Hole in the Wall Camps, for which he cared so much."" He was often willing to make fun of himself. Early in his career he was mistaken for fellow Method actor Marlon Brando; Newman obligingly signed autographs, ""Best wishes, Marlon Brando.""  Read more reaction to from Paul Newman's friends and family » . Newman was a Method-trained actor who blazed his own career trail and didn't shy away from risky roles -- inside and outside films.  Watch a look back at Newman's career » . A portrayal as a race-car driver in 1969's ""Winning"" led to his actual competition in races; at 70, he participated in the 24 Hours of Daytona and he was still racing at age 80. He stumped for liberal causes, including Eugene McCarthy's 1968 presidential candidacy, and earned a spot on Richard Nixon's enemies list -- ""the highest single honor I've ever received,"" he said. In 1982, Newman and his friend A.E. Hotchner founded Newman's Own, a food company that produced food ranging from pasta sauces to salad dressing to chocolate chip cookies. ""The embarrassing thing is that the salad dressing is outgrossing my films,"" Newman once wryly noted. To date, the company -- which donates all profits to charities such as Newman's Hole in the Wall camps -- has given away more than $200 million. Newman established the camp to benefit gravely ill children. ""He saw the camps as places where kids could escape the fear, pain and isolation of their conditions, kick back and raise a little hell,"" Forrester said. Today, there are 11 Hole in the Wall camps around the world, with additional programs in Africa and Vietnam. Some 135,000 children have attended the camps -- free of charge. The Association of Hole in the Wall Camps ""is part of his living legacy, and for that we remain forever grateful,"" the association said in a statement. ""We are greatly saddened by his passing. His leadership and spirit can never be replaced. But he has left us strong and confident."" Newman was half of one of the most successful showbiz marriages -- to Joanne Woodward, whom he married in 1958. He observed that just because he was a sex symbol there was no reason to commit adultery. ""Why would I go out for a hamburger when [I] have steak at home?"" he asked. Newman's daughters said described him as a devoted husband, a loving father, an adoring grandfather and a dedicated philanthropist. ""Our father was a rare symbol of selfless humility, the last to acknowledge what he was doing was special,"" they said in a statement. ""Intensely private, he quietly succeeded beyond measure in impacting the lives of so many with his generosity. ""Always and to the end, Dad was incredibly grateful for his good fortune. In his own words: 'It's been a privilege to be here.'"" The statement requested privacy for Newman's family. CNN's Larry King, who interviewed Newman through the years, said he greatly admired the actor. ""He lived a long and terrific life,"" King said Saturday morning. ""He was much appreciated. Did some theater, graduated Yale. Long marriage to Joanne Woodward. One of those showbiz rarities.""  Watch Larry King reminisce about Paul Newman » . Paul Leonard Newman was born on January 26, 1925, in Shaker Heights, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland. His father owned a successful sporting goods store, but young Paul was taken with his mother's and uncle's interest in the arts and started acting while still in grade school. ""I wasn't running toward the theater but running away from the sporting goods store,"" he said later. After being kicked out of Ohio University for unruly behavior, he joined the Navy and served for three years during World War II. After the war he attended Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, where his unruly ways led him to theater. Newman continued studying acting at Yale and at New York's Actors' Studio, earning jobs in the growing medium of television. He made his Broadway debut in William Inge's 1953 play ""Picnic,"" opposite Kim Stanley, one of the most successful stage actresses of her time. The next year he made his first Hollywood film, ""The Silver Chalice,"" a bomb that he mocked for the rest of his life. He even took out a newspaper ad apologizing for his performance. But success as boxer Rocky Graziano in ""Somebody Up There Likes Me"" (1956) made him a star, and more hits followed: ""The Long, Hot Summer"" (1958) opposite his soon-to-be wife, Woodward; ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" (1958) with Elizabeth Taylor; and ""The Young Philadelphians"" (1959). But the 1960s were to be Newman's decade, a perfect match for his ironic, anti-establishment attitude. iReport.com: What do you remember best about Paul Newman? He began the decade with ""Exodus"" (1960), an epic about Israel's founding directed by Otto Preminger, and succeeded it with ""The Hustler"" (1961) as pool shark Fast Eddie Felson; ""Sweet Bird of Youth"" (1962), another Tennessee Williams work; and ""Hud"" (1963), ""Harper"" (1966) and ""Hombre"" (1967), continuing a good-luck streak of films beginning with ""H."" After ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967), in which he played the egg-eating malcontented title character, he turned to directing, earning raves for his behind-the-camera work on ""Rachel, Rachel"" (1968), starring his wife.  Watch Newman discuss what he would have done differently » . ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" (1969) and ""The Sting"" (1973) teamed Newman with co-star Robert Redford and director George Roy Hill. The trio proved to be box-office gold: They were two of the highest-grossing films of their time, winning a slew of awards -- including a best picture Oscar for the latter, a tale of con men in 1930s Chicago. Newman finally teamed up with Steve McQueen, who had been scheduled to be his co-star in ""Butch Cassidy,"" in 1974's ""The Towering Inferno."" Though the Irwin Allen-produced disaster film earned mixed critical notices, it, too, was one of the most successful box-office films of the era.  Watch how Newman worked his magic » . Newman's career started faltering in the late '70s as he turned his attention to his other pursuits, notably racing. The loss of his son Scott to a drug overdose in 1978 hit the actor hard. He made an artistic comeback with 1982's ""The Verdict,"" the story of an ambulance-chasing hard-luck lawyer in which Newman appeared broken, raspy and every inch of his 57 years. By the time Newman starred in ""The Color of Money,"" directed by Martin Scorsese, his movie career had slipped a notch. Never afraid of playing his age, Newman portrayed a repressed businessman in 1990's ""Mr. and Mrs. Bridge,"" a cantankerous lodger in ""Nobody's Fool"" (1994), a fatherly, retired gangster in ""Road to Perdition"" (2002), and the voice of a Hudson Hornet in ""Cars"" (2006). He gained some of his best reviews for his performance as the stage manager in a Broadway production of Thornton Wilder's classic play, ""Our Town,"" filmed for television in 2003, and was perfectly cast as the rascally father to Ed Harris' responsible diner owner in the miniseries ""Empire Falls."" In recent years, Newman talked about doing another film with his friend Redford, but the two couldn't settle on a script. In 2007, Newman said he was retiring from acting, saying he'd lost confidence in his abilities. Still, he marveled at his own resilience. ""You can't be as old as I am without waking up with a surprised look on your face every morning: 'Holy Christ, whaddya know - I'm still around!' It's absolutely amazing that I survived all the booze and smoking and the cars and the career.""

"Federal authorities accuse a 35-year-old Florida man of hacking into accounts on computers and other devices belonging to more than 50 people, including entertainers Scarlett Johansson, Christina Aguilera, Mila Kunis, Simone Harouche and Renee Olstead, officials announced Wednesday. Christopher Chaney of Jacksonville, Florida, was indicted on charges of accessing protected computers without authorization, damaging protected computers, wiretapping and aggravated identity theft, officials said. ""Unfortunately, Mr. Chaney was able to access nude photos of some of the celebrities and some of them were uploaded on the Internet,"" U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. said. A recently circulated nude photo of Johannsson is part of the investigation, he said. Chaney allegedly ""also took financial information, movie scripts and conversations that the celebrities believed to be private,"" Birotte told reporters. Chaney allegedly was able to access passwords by monitoring social media and other online sites that the celebrities used, said Steven Martinez, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office. ""You may have selected a password that's meaningful to you that you may disclose online with friends,"" Martinez said. ""Your pet's name or whatever. That's a clue to a hacker, to start there."" The suspect used several aliases such as ""trainreqsuckswhat,"" ""anonygrrl,"" and ""jaxjaguars911,"" authorities said in a news release. Chaney also allegedly used public sources to mine data about his victims, which included both males and females, all associated with the entertainment industry, authorities said. Authorities allege that once Chaney hacked into a celebrity's e-mail account, he would use the contact lists to find other celebrities' e-mail accounts. This allowed him to add new victims, authorities charge. Chaney made his initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Jacksonville, Florida, on Wednesday afternoon, and was released on a $10,000 unsecured bond with the conditions that he can't use any computer or other device with Internet access and he can't have any controlled substances or excessive use of alcohol, said Laura Eimiller, an FBI spokeswoman in Los Angeles. Chaney's next court appearance will be at 10:30 a.m. Friday for an identity hearing in the same courthouse, Eimiller said. Chaney has been indicted on with nine counts of computer hacking for gain, eight counts of aggravated identify theft, and nine counts of illegal wiretapping, Birotte said. If convicted of the 26 counts, Chaney would face a maximum of 121 years in federal prison, Birotte said. The aggravated identity theft charge alone carries a mandatory two-year prison sentence, he added. Chaney allegedly also set his victims' accounts to automatically forward their e-mails to his account, Birotte said. This allegedly allowed Chaney to continue to receive celebrities' e-mails even after a password was reset, authorities said. Authorities allege that Chaney distributed photos of the celebrities that he obtained illegally and offered them to various celebrity blog sites. Some of the illegally obtained files, including private photographs, were ultimately posted online ""as a result of Chaney's alleged activities,"" authorities said in a statement. The FBI's Los Angeles office said he was arrested as part of ""Operation Hackerazzi,"" which looked into computer intrusions targeting individuals associated with the entertainment industry. Martinez said authorities have coined a word to describe hackers of celebrities' e-mail accounts: hackerazzi. ""The paparazzi is always chasing them down, and now you have a virtual way of doing it by looking at posts they put on social media sites,"" Martinez said, explaining the term. Investigators don't have a motive for Chaney's alleged offenses. ""Motive is always a question in criminal cases and we don't know and we don't care"" in this case, Birotte said, adding he is confident of the hacking evidence against Chaney. The first real case of a celebrity hacking attack was in 2005, when hackers logged into Paris Hilton's phone and stole photos of her, according to Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at the F-Secure computer security company. Those hackers reportedly were able to break into Hilton's phone by correctly guessing the not-so-secret answer to her security question, which was ""tinkerbell,"" the name of her pet Chihuahua. In August, rapper Kreayshawn wrote on her blog that her Twitter account was hacked when naked photos of her showed up there. In March, Vanessa Hudgens of ""High School Musical"" underwent a similar ordeal after photos were reportedly stolen from her Gmail account. And in December, police in Germany alleged two young men had used computer-hacking skills to gain access to the e-mail accounts and photos of more than 50 celebrities, according to Britain's The Telegraph, including the likes of Lady Gaga and Ke$ha. In the wake of the latest celebrity hacking allegations, some have started to assume celebrity photo leaks are the newest front in the so-called ""hacktivist"" wars, waged by big-name hacking rings such as Anonymous and LulzSec. Those groups have claimed responsibility for taking down bank and government websites. But security experts said connections between celebrity hackers and groups such as Anonymous are thin or nonexistent. ""It's obviously to gain media exposure, right?"" said Kevin Mitnick, a hacker turned security consultant and author of ""Ghost in the Wires."" ""It's like everyone is trying to one-up Anonymous and one-up LulzSec. So somehow celebrities are becoming a target.""","Christopher Chaney makes first court appearance; he's released on $10,000 bond .

"More than a week after a raid on an al Qaeda stronghold in Yemen to free hostages, an American captive, who was not rescued, appears in a video, begging into the camera for his life. In the recording recently posted by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, also known as AQAP, the terror group threatens to kill Luke Somers, if Washington does not meet its demands. AQAP member Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi, who reads a statement, does not say what the demands are but claims that the U.S. government knows them. Somers also gives a short statement asking for help and identifying himself. ""My name is Luke Somers. I'm 33 years old. I was born in England, but I carry American citizenship and have lived in America for most of my life,"" he says. Somers, a photojournalist, fell into the hands of kidnappers in September last year. He missed being saved in a raid last week by U.S. and Yemini special forces that freed eight hostages. The raid was planned after al Qaeda militants were spotted transferring the hostages into pickups, ""chained and covered in blankets,"" according to a website associated with Yemen's defense ministry. Militants drove them to a cave over 65 miles away from the town of Hajir al-Saiyer. U.S. and Yemeni special forces outfitted with night visors embarked on the mission about four miles from the cave. They encountered the kidnappers nearby; a gun battle ensued, and the forces killed all seven abductors. They also freed eight chained up hostages, who told them that militants had moved five more hostages, including Somers, to another location. The Yemeni account did not mention the U.S. Special Forces, but a U.S. official confirmed their participation. CNN, at the request of the government, delayed reporting the information about the raid, so as not to endanger the search for Somers and the other hostages at that time.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- An international medical group has cleared a South Korean biopharmaceutical company in the deaths of two patients following stem cell procedures in other countries. ""It is not our conclusion that stem cells killed these patients,"" David Audley, the executive director of the International Cellular Medicine Society (ICMS), said in a news conference in Seoul Tuesday. The South Korean media reported last month that two patients who had received stem cell procedures in Japan and China had died, and cited allegations that RNL Bio had lured clients to clinics overseas to skirt domestic laws banning stem cell treatment. The ICMS refuted the charges, citing forensic evidence it had gathered from RNL Bio, medical records and interviews from Japan and China. ""It is very important that we distinguish the words cause and correlation,"" said bioethicist Glenn McGee, who participated in the ICMS investigation. He explained that the dangers of the medical procedures undertaken in the treatments does not mean the stem cells used in the therapy are dangerous. The ICMS is the largest multinational group of physicians studying the use of adult stem cells and tracks the cases of about 700 patients around the world who receive treatment. Potential dangers cited in the media about carcinogenic cell growth pertain only to embryonic stem cells and is unrelated to the treatment with adult stem cells that is cited in the investigation, according to the group. No deaths have been reported in the cases registered with the society, according to Audley. The two patients from RNL were not registered with the ICMS, although the bio company does participate in patient registry with the group. In the first of the two cases, a 61-year-old man traveled to China for treatment with stem cells provided by RNL for diabetes and other ailments. He died two months later. His cause of death has not been determined, but it is ""unlikely"" the result of the stem cell procedure, according to the ICMS. The death of a 73-year-old former surgeon, who died on the same day he was treated in Japan, ""was due to a pre-existing blood clot that traveled to the lungs, and may have been precipitated by the procedure used to infuse the stem cells, or less probably, from a clot formed by the cells,"" according to the ICMS findings published on the group's website. Stem cell banking is allowed in clinics such as RNL Bio, which specializes in extracting, cultivating and storing adult stem cells obtained from fatty tissue of patients. Patients are only able to receive treatment with these stored cells overseas, and RNL Bio regularly refers patients to clinics in other countries that are determined capable of using their stem cells. No financial exchanges are made for these referrals, according to Kim Ju-sun, the company's public relations director. The ICMS also concluded in its report that no financial transaction could be traced to RNL Bio from the clinics that conducted the stem cell treatments. Under South Korean regulations, stem cell treatments are not authorized and can only be used in clinical trials approved by the Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA). The KFDA and the Ministry of Welfare announced they will conduct an investigation into the potential dangers of unauthorized stem cell treatment in the country and create countermeasures, according to a statement from the KFDA.","Two patients die following stem cell treatments in China and Japan .

"London (CNN) -- Greece's left-wing party Syriza bucked the lurch right in Europe's elections, beating the country's two political mainstays into first place. The party posted an estimated 27% of the vote, four points clear of the center-right's New Democracy, which is headed by Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras. The results were in sharp contrast to the dramatic rise of Marine Le Pen's National Front in France and UKIP in the United Kingdom, both far-right nationalist parties. Syriza received almost three times the votes polled by Greece's far-right Golden Dawn party, which gained nearly 10% and two parliamentarians despite its leaders facing charges of running a criminal organization. Syriza's leader Alexis Tsipras said in a press conference Europe had taken ""an important step for the end of the disastrous policies of austerity and the return of democracy. The people of Europe [have] condemned the policies of austerity."" Tsipras, who dominated the left-wing stage during Greece's national elections in 2012, said the results were ""historic,"" and revealed a firm rejection of Europe's austerity measures. ""The message is that the disastrous policy of austerity must be terminated. All European nations must invest in democracy, growth, social cohesion and solidarity,"" he said. In a statement, Syriza said the European election results showed the government no longer had ""moral and political legitimacy"" to negotiate with Europe and that the party would seek a snap election. Syriza's rise comes as Greece struggles to drag itself out of six years of grinding recession, amid austerity measures demanded in return for the country's 240 billion euros worth of bailouts. In April, Greece returned to the bond markets after being locked out for four years, suggesting a change in fortunes for the struggling eurozone nation. However, Greeks told CNN everyday life continued to be tough. Greek unemployment remains the highest in the eurozone, just above Spain at 25.3% . Syriza stormed into the national political stage when it took 27% of the vote in 2012's national elections, coming second to New Democracy. After increasing its support six-fold in three years and beating Pasok to second place, Syriza had become the country's dominant left-wing force. However New Democracy partnered with Pasok, the historically entrenched party of the center-left, to form a government while Syriza remained in opposition. Syriza's support in the national elections was attributed to a fury at austerity measures and its appeal to youth voting for the first time. Tsipras himself is seen as a smart political operator, ambitious and ruthless. Tsipras, 39, was born the year Greece's military dictatorship fell, and represented a Greek youth unfettered by history, according to supporters at the time. In an interview at the time with CNN after the national elections, Tsipras said he would tear up the austerity plans because he believed it was sending the country to ""hell."" A trained civil engineer, who joined the Communist Youth of Greece as a high school student, Tsipras shot to prominence in 2006. After being put forward as a candidate for the mayor of Athens, he swept 10% of the vote to come third -- far more than previous left-wing candidates had managed. EXPLORE: Europe's protest parties .

"President Barack Obama will announce his pick for Secretary of Defense on Friday morning, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday afternoon during the daily White House briefing. Obama is slated to nominate Ashton Carter, former second in command at the Pentagon, as CNN has previously reported. RELATED: Meet Chuck Hagel's expected replacement as Defense Secretary . Pending confirmation in the Senate, Carter will succeed outgoing Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, who announced his resignation last week. Hagel has said he will stay on board until a successor is confirmed. Carter, 60, served as Deputy Defense Secretary under both Hagel and Obama's first Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. He'd be the fourth secretary of defense of Obama's six-year tenure including Robert Gates, a hold-over from President George W. Bush. Some consider Carter the last man standing for a job others have declined. Obama adviser Michele Flournoy was initially considered to be a frontrunner for the position after Hagel announced he'd be leaving, leaving room for her to make history as the first woman to hold the post. But she quickly took her name out of the running in a letter to the Center for a New American Security, a think tank she co-founded in 2007. Other potential replacements who took their names out of consideration include Senator Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson. RELATED: Was Hagel doomed from the start? Carter, who has worked at the Pentagon for years but has largely remained outside the spotlight, is regarded as a top intellect on national security issues by those who work with him. His admirers include Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who called him an ""uber-wonk"" at his farewell ceremony when Carter left the Defense Department in 2013. From 2011 to 2013, Carter worked as deputy secretary of defense, maintaining a portfolio that includes a $600 billion annual budget and over two million civilian and military personnel. He took up a job as an undersecretary in the Department of Defense shortly after Obama's first inauguration. Earlier, Carter served as assistant secretary of defense for international security policy under President Bill Clinton, emerging as an expert in nuclear weapons policy. And before his tenure in the public sector, he was a professor at Harvard University and worked as the director of the Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School. RELATED: McCain: Ashton Carter won't be heard at W.H.","The White House will announce its pick for Secretary of Defense Friday.

"The coal ash poured out of a broken pipe into the Dan River, turning water into dark muck. It took nearly a week to stem the spill, which sent millions of gallons of sludge from a retired power plant into a river that supplies drinking water to communities in North Carolina and neighboring Virginia. Workers stopped the spill by plugging the broken pipe with concrete this weekend. Now government scientists and the United States' largest electric utility face a daunting task: cleaning it up. Tests since the spill have turned up higher levels of harmful chemicals such as arsenic in the river. But so far, officials say tap water is safe to drink. Some environmental activists in the area say they aren't so sure. They fear the consequences for wildlife and say that the situation shows state regulators haven't done enough to crack down on Duke Energy. The utility has apologized for the spill and vowed to clean up any damage. ""We're committed to the Dan River and the communities that it serves,"" Charlie Gates, the company's senior vice president of power generation operations, said in a statement Saturday. ""We are accountable for what has happened and have plenty of work ahead of us."" Concerns over drinking water, wildlife . Duke Energy announced last week that it found the leak in a 48-inch stormwater pipe at the retired Dan River Steam Station in Eden, North Carolina, on February 2. On Saturday, six days later, the company said it had plugged the broken pipe that was causing the spill and was working with officials on developing a cleanup plan. Coal ash, the material that remains after burning coal for electricity, contains metals such as arsenic, selenium and cadmium. Tests of the river last week revealed levels of copper, aluminum, iron and arsenic above state standards for surface water, state environmental officials said. It's unclear what that could mean for wildlife in the area, said Jamie Kritzer, a spokesman for the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources. ""It's certainly cause for concern for the long-term impacts of this coal ash spill on the health of the Dan River,"" he said. Environmental advocates warn that the damage could be significant, potentially harming fish in the river and impacting the food chain. ""You have a cleanup effort that is going to be difficult,"" said Sam Perkins, who works for the Catawba Riverkeeper Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group dedicated to protecting waterways in the area. ""This shows even a small spill has an impact on the ecosystem."" Some activists accuse authorities of deliberately playing down the danger of the situation and taking too long to notify the public. ""This is another shameless attempt by (environmental officials)  to downplay the risks facing the communities along the Dan River downstream,"" Peter Harrison of the Waterkeeper Alliance advocacy group said in a written statement to CNN on Friday. ""Are we supposed to feel good that there are only four hazardous toxins, including a carcinogen, in our drinking water supply?"" Samples taken by the Waterkeeper Alliance last week contained ""extremely high levels of arsenic, chromium, iron, lead and other toxic metals,"" the group said in a statement. State environmental officials said Sunday that arsenic levels appeared to be decreasing, but recommended avoiding prolonged direct contact with the river in the area of the spill until further notice. Unclear how long cleanup will take . Kritzer said authorities have been open about what they've found. ""We're not downplaying risks. We're doing our objective analysis of what we're seeing so far, and I think we are concerned,"" he said. ""The Dan River is a gem, and people value it throughout the state for not only being a source of drinking water, but also for its aquatic life that it provides a home to and all the recreational uses. This is certainly something that concerns all of us."" Tiffany Haworth, executive director of the Dan River Basin Association, first learned about the spill from a mail carrier, who warned that the river's water had turned black. The situation is heartbreaking, she said. ""I stood on the bank a day or two after the spill, and I can say that I openly cried,"" she said. ""I was thinking, 'How can this ever heal? How can this ever be cleaned up? And what is this going to do to what I would consider one of the most beautiful parts of our country?'"" Now, she said, cleanup is key. ""The longer it's allowed to sit there ...t he sediment that has not gone down the river will be constantly churned up as it goes downstream, and the longer that we wait, obviously the more damage can occur,"" she said. The North Carolina spill comes weeks after a chemical spill in West Virginia left 300,000 people unable to use their water supply for days. Now, a federal grand jury is looking into that spill in what one official called a criminal investigation. In North Carolina, authorities will investigate the coal ash spill to determine what violations occurred, Kritzer said. State and federal agencies are working with Duke Energy to figure out the next steps for cleanup, he said. At this point, it's unclear how long that could take. Authorities were still working to develop a cleanup plan Sunday, Duke Energy spokeswoman Lisa Parrish said. ""Simultaneous efforts have been under way to not only plug the pipe and cap the system, which we successfully achieved last night, but also to test water quality. We've been testing water quality since the leak occurred and will continue to do so,"" she said. ""Water quality tests will inform our cleanup efforts and accelerate our planning for the best long-term solution at the site."" Even before last week's spill, coal ash contamination was a concern for North Carolina officials. The state filed lawsuits against Duke Energy last year, asking the court to order the utility to deal with groundwater and wastewater violations at 14 sites where the byproducts of coal power plants are stored, according to a statement from Gov. Pat McCrory's office. Parrish said Sunday that the utility is in the midst of plans to close the sites where it stores coal ash in North Carolina. ""Ash basin closure planning is already well under way for the ash basins located in North Carolina, including the one at Dan River,"" Parrish said. ""We look forward to moving ahead with that project."" Governor has close ties with company . Before he ran for governor, McCrory worked for Duke Energy for nearly three decades, and critics have claimed he's shied away from regulation during his time in public office due to his close ties with the utility. In a statement last week, McCrory said his administration was the first in the state's history to take legal action against the utility over the ponds. ""We have been moving on this issue since the beginning of my term and will continue to do so,"" he said. Environmental advocates say the spill is a reminder of a troubling problem that's widespread in the state: coal ash ponds storing large amounts of waste close to drinking water supplies. The spill raises questions, the Catawba Riverkeeper Foundation advocacy group said in an online post. Key among them -- what chemicals are scientists testing for, was drinking water contaminated and will the utility change its coal ash disposal approach as a result? According to figures released by Duke Energy, last week's spill appears to be similar to, but smaller than, a 2008 coal ash spill at a power plant in Kingston, Tennessee, which sent 1.1 billion gallons of sludge into the adjacent Emory River. State authorities slapped the Tennessee Valley Authority with $11.5 million fines after that spill, which authorities said violated state clean-water and solid waste disposal laws. In statements announcing the North Carolina spill last week, Duke Energy said up to 82,000 tons of ash had been released and up to 27 million gallons of basin water had flooded into the river. That amount of ash, the company said, would fill up to 32 Olympic-size swimming pools.","A broken stormwater pipe sent millions of gallons of sludge into the Dan River .

"Congressional Democrats are upping the pressure on President Barack Obama to fix what's ailing his signature health care initiative with some in the party warning they may be forced to back a House Republican proposal if the White House doesn't offer an alternative by week's end. ""We've got to get out of the bunker and fix these problems,"" a senior congressional Democratic source told CNN's Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash of flaws in the newly rolled out law that have energized Republican efforts to weaken the President and his allies and derail a policy they have long considered unworkable. The White House has until Friday to devise a solution to the problem-plagued roll out of the Affordable Care Act, the source said. That's when House Republicans will take up a bill to address one of the more politically potent Obamacare problems for the President and Democrats -- those losing their health coverage due to the law despite Obama's assurances in selling it to the public that Americans could keep their plans if they wanted. The House bill would allow those insurance plans to extend into next year and gut a major part of the law by allowing anyone to purchase them, even though the existing policies don't meet the tougher requirements of the Obamacare initiative. Poll: Obama approval ratings drop, Americans say he's not trustworthy . Among other things, the Affordable Care Act prohibits discrimination for preexisting conditions and mandates coverage for mental health, prenatal care and other issues. This is a primary reason why insurance companies are dropping existing coverage. ""In the absence of a solution that Democrats can support from the White House, you will see more and more Democrats voting for the Upton bill,"" the Democratic source said of the plan being advanced this week by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton of Michigan. Fewer than 50,000 sign up on Obamacare website, media report suggests . Cancellations drive concern . Although the rocky rollout of the Obamacare website and expected low enrollment figures for the first five weeks of the program are embarrassments for the President and Democrats in Congress who rammed through the health law in 2010 without Republican support, it is the policy cancellations that are really driving Democrats to put more pressure the White House. Obama has apologized to those losing their coverage despite his assurances to the contrary and appears to be taking a hit for his Obamacare woes, according to the latest polling. His approval rating among American voters has dropped to its lowest number in Quinnipiac University polling since he became President with new doubts being raised about trust. Things could get even more heated on Wednesday when White House Chief Technology Officer Todd Park will testify before a congressional committee investigating the rocky rollout of the HealthCare.gov website, the Obama administration said. Park had been subpoenaed to appear by House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa. Pressure to come up with a fix . Rep. Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, told reporters that Obama needs to come up with a solution ""sooner rather than later."" While New York Democratic Rep. Steve Israel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, criticized the House GOP plan, saying he believes it would increase premiums and remove consumer protections. ""We should do something so long as it actually fixes the problem and doesn't make the problem worse."" Israel told reporters Tuesday, saying it would be helpful if the White House came out with a proposal before Friday's House vote. He noted a White House official will meet with Democrats on Wednesday and played down the notion they are breaking with the administration on the issue. But Rep. John Larsen of Connecticut,  a loyal liberal and former House Democratic leader, said he hasn't seen details of the House GOP bill, but said he thought it could ""make sense"" and that there ""could be support"" depending on the approach. Hoyer said earlier he hadn't ruled out being open to Upton's bill, but his spokeswoman says he's now opposed since Upton has said he won't make changes and Democratic leaders will likely urge their caucus to vote against it. Boosting pressure further on Obama was former President Bill Clinton, who said on Tuesday that the President should find a way to uphold his initial promises about health policies. Clinton: Obama should 'honor commitment' on keeping health plans . ""I personally believe, even if it takes a change in the law, the President should honor the commitment the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they've got,"" Clinton said during an interview with the website OZY.com. A Senate Democratic approach . A growing number of Democrats have called for changes or delays to the program as many face  tough reelection bids in 2014 and are feeling pressure from challengers and constituents. Obamacare rattling Democratic nerves . Although he didn't go nearly as far as Clinton, Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois, said he is open to changes as well and noted that Obama should have been more careful with his words in the first place. ""A couple more sentences added would clarify it,"" the Senate's second-highest Democrat said on CNN's ""Newsroom"" with Ashleigh Banfield. ""The president apologized. He said very clearly he was sorry if he misled people."" Durbin added that Republicans and Democrats ""need to be open to constructive changes to make this law work better."" Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, introduced a narrower bill than what House Republicans are planning with Upton's plan and said that she has growing support in the Senate, including Dianne Feinstein, Joe Manchin, Mark Pryor and Kay Hagan -- all Democrats. She noted her proposal would allow people who have individual insurance, which she says makes up about 5% of the market, to keep their coverage. Insurers would have to notify those customers what minimum coverage requirements are not being met. ""First of all, (Obama) apologized. And he's also apologized for the poor roll out.  And again, these things are real problems and they have to be fixed,"" Landrieu told CNN's Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash. ""But the promise of the Affordable Care Act, let me say again, is worth fighting for. And Republicans that continue to think that they're going to undermine it, repeal it, or defund it are wrong. They're on the wrong side of history,"" she said. White House spokesperson Jay Carney said Obama agreed with Clinton and is working to address the matter of people losing their coverage. He has already set in motion an aggressive effort to fix the website problems. Behind the scenes: Fixing the Obamacare website . Carney rejected the Upton bill as ""not an effective fix"" because it opens up the plans to anyone, not just the people who's plans are being canceled. ""The President has instructed his team to look at a range of options"" to find solutions for people who have lost their plans, Carney said. Enrollment woes . Democratic anger over the cancellation of insurance policies come as people wait for the release of enrollment numbers. What will Obamacare enrollment numbers tell us? The Obama administration is expected to release them by the end of  this week but has yet to say exactly when. White House officials are is lowering expectations, cautioning the numbers ""will be lower than we hoped and we anticipated,"" Carney said. It is blaming a faulty federally run website that is hindering the ability of consumers to sign up for coverage. ""We are working 24-7 to ensure that the site is working smoothly for the vast majority of users by the end of November,"" said Chris Jennings, deputy assistant to the President for health policy. Young coders build health-care website in days . Consumers have until December 15 to submit payment for coverage that begins January 1. The overall sign-up deadline for 2014 is next March 31.","Democrats say White House has until Friday to come up with fix to Obamacare problems .
That's when House Republicans will vote on bill reversing insurance cancellations .

"In his re-election pitch, the likely incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed to repeal Obamacare, saying the law should be pulled out ""root and branch."" But now? The Kentucky Republican is singing quite a different tune. ""We may have that vote,"" McConnell said of repealing President Barack Obama's signature health care law on Fox News Thursday. ""But I don't think that there's six Democrats that are going to vote with 54 Republicans and pass it."" Instead, McConnell suggested that an upcoming Supreme Court ruling may be the best way to undermine the law to the point of collapse. ""The Supreme Court could well decide that we get a second chance,""he said. The case, King v. Burwell, places at issue whether federal subsidies for purchasing health insurance can be made available to qualified individuals purchasing coverage in states lacking their own marketplaces, or exchanges. Asked in the interview what would happen if the Supreme Court rules against allowing the subsidies, McConnell replied, ""I think it's on its way to collapse, yeah."" What would happen next? ""We go back and do it right,"" McConnell said. The court is expected to rule on the case in June.","Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell says he ""may"" hold an Obamacare repeal vote .

"Like a groggy traveler after a long, cold night, the European Space Agency's comet-chasing Rosetta spacecraft woke up, warmed up and called home Monday before setting off on the final leg of its journey. Rosetta shook off 31 months of sleep, during which it traveled into the dark reaches of the solar system, and contacted its operators Monday evening. Cheers erupted in the ESA mission control center in Darmstadt, Germany, when a signal from Rosetta arrived shortly after 7 p.m. (1 p.m. ET). ""The spacecraft is there, it's awake, and I think we are all overwhelmed,"" mission manager Gerhard Schwehm told reporters. Now, he said, controllers will have ""two busy years ahead of them"" as it approaches its target, Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and follows it around the sun. There was only an hour window for the signal to reach Earth, putting scientists on pins and needles. ""The spacecraft decided to make us suffer after two and half year,"" Paolo Ferri, head of ESA Mission Operations told CNN.  ""We came almost to the end of the window, we were very tense,"" he said. The unmanned probe was launched in 2004 and is now nearly 500 million miles (800 million kilometers) from the Sun -- a distance that puts it just past the orbit of Jupiter. At that distance, the message it beamed back took 45 minutes to arrive. When the signal finally arrived there were cheers of relief. Wake up Rosetta: You have a date with a comet . If all goes well, Rosetta will rendezvous with the comet in August and fly with it for two years.  Scientists now have to learn how to maneuver the craft around a comet. ""It's flying in a very unusual environment for space flight with gas and dust and not much gravity to keep your obit stable,"" Ferri said. Rosetta is also supposed to send a small lander to the surface of the comet in November. The mission will give scientists unprecedented insight into the makeup and structure of these ancient residents of the solar system, ESA officials say. ""This is groundbreaking science,"" Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor told ESA television. ""We're looking at where we came from, the evolution of our own solar system. And comets are looked upon as kind of a time capsule back to the beginning of the solar system."" Scientists believe comets, composed of rock and ice, may have brought water and maybe even the primitive building blocks of life to Earth. Rosetta carries 11 scientific instruments; its lander has 10 more. ESA controllers ordered Rosetta to shut down most of its systems in June 2011 to save on power as it sailed through the darkest reaches of the solar system. The amount of sunlight reaching the solar-powered probe is only 4% that on Earth, according to ESA.

"(CNN)What has a jet engine, a rocket booster and travels on a set of aluminum wheels? It's the Bloodhound SuperSonic Car (SSC) and it has plans to hit the world land speed record at 1,000 mph. Made of titanium, carbon fiber and, like superman, is designed to go faster than a speeding bullet, the Bloodhound SSC has been painstakingly put together and tested over the better part of six years. In 2016, the UK-based team plan to take the 42-foot (8.9m) vehicle to Hakskeen Pan, a dry lake bed in South Africa, for a crack at the record breaking attempt. Former fighter jet pilot Royal Air Force (RAF) Wing Commander Andy Green said even designing a car that can hold together at these blistering speeds has been a triumph of the engineer's art. ""No rubber,"" he told CNN from The Bloodhound Project headquarters in Bristol, UK. ""Beyond about 450mph it's really, really hard to keep a tire on - they just get flung off. So we have solid aluminum. ""We've been through a huge evolution of finding something that's tough enough that would do the job. Basically this car goes faster than a speeding bullet, so anything that hits this is like being shot at from a gun."" The former jet ace, who has flown combat missions over Iraq, Bosnia and Afghanistan, can lay claim to be the only man to have broken the sound barrier in the air and on land. In 1997, he hit 763 mph or Mach 1 in the vehicle ThrustSSC to become the first man to break the sound barrier on land. The Bloodhound Project takes the land speed record a step further in a car that is part jet fighter, part Formula 1 racer and part space rocket. ""A thousand miles an hour at ground level is faster than any jet fighter has ever traveled in history, so there are going to be some major challenges,"" Green said. Besides three engines delivering 135,000 horsepower, the Bloodhound is equipped with rocket boosters to deliver the thrust necessary to get it to 1,000 mph. ""(The jet engines) on their own will take us to 600mph or thereabouts, but to get a land speed record, at about 350 miles an hour we turn on a rocket engine to take us all the way through to a 1000mph,"" said lead designer Mark Chapman. ""The rocket is the key -- that's the difference between 750 mph and 1,000 mph."" The Bloodhound team scoured the globe to find a desert run that could accommodate a vehicle which, at 1,000 mph, is likely to run out of road in a matter of seconds. The requirements were a perfectly flat landscape, at least 12 miles long and two miles wide. They eventually selected Hakskeen Pan, in Northern Cape, South Africa where Bloodhound SSC will cover a mile in 3.6 seconds -- equivalent to 4.5 football pitches laid end to end every second. Having already set the land speed record, Green is in a good place to describe what it is like in the cockpit of the world's fastest cars. Even so, the new challenges presented by Bloodhound SSC sometimes leave him lost for words. ""The best single description I've ever heard was from the late, great Art Arfons who set three world records in the 1960s and got up to almost 600 mph. ""Somebody asked him one day what it was like and he said: 'What is it like to drive a land-speed (record)? To drive a jet car to do 600 miles an hour over the ground? ""And he said: 'It's a bit like the taste of chocolate. If you've never had a bar of chocolate I am really going to struggle to explain what it is like'."" Ultimately, he said, the cockpit is place of tremendous G forces, heat and vibration. ""In a land-speed car, that's just a normal day in the office. Uncomfortable, but that's what it's like. It's hugely busy, it's very hot, it's very noisy. Apart from all those things, it should be fairly simple."" While the aim of the project is to crack the magic 1,000 mph mark (the closest yet has been an American F104 jet fighter which flew just above ground level at 988mph), Green said the ultimately the record attempt is about instilling a sense of engineering progress in future generations. ""This about developing technology. This is about finding out new things. This is about exploring,"" he said. ""And the story of engineering exploration is about the failures and the challenges, not just about the successes.""","The jet-propelled Bloodhound SuperSonic Car aims to be the first car to hit 1,000 mph .

"Only 61 people in the history of the United States have held the position. It's the second most powerful in the country and second in line to the presidency. But after this week, not many people may want to be Speaker of the House. John Boehner, the chain-smoking, politically moderate, congressman from southwestern Ohio who has held the job for the past three years, has seen his power to corral his Republican caucus tested. He's just come out on the losing end of a ferocious battle with President Barack Obama to reopen the government and avert a possible default. ""We fought the good fight, we just didn't win,"" Boehner told a Cincinnati radio station on Wednesday. A GOP congressman who was in a closed-door meeting late Wednesday afternoon with the caucus told CNN's Dana Bash: ""Speaker Boehner said, 'Look, I don't want everybody beating each other up. I know this isn't everything we want, but we're going to live to fight another day.'"" Boehner -- who despite his very public defeat is still safe in his job as the House leader, say some key conservatives -- received a standing ovation Wednesday afternoon during that meeting of the entire House Republican conference. ""I've actually been very proud of Speaker Boehner the last two-and-a-half weeks. I don't think that he should be ashamed of anything he has done,"" Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho told reporters. But Obama has doubted Boehner's ability to get things done, saying earlier, ""he can't control his caucus."" Still, Newt Gingrich, who held the position during the last government shutdown in the mid 1990s, put it this way: ""It's actually the hardest job in the city."" Boehner urges House GOP to support Senate deal . The inside game . Boehner has been challenged by the small but powerful right wing of the GOP caucus: the tea party conservatives. He was reluctantly pushed into adopting a tactic to link the debt ceiling and funding the government to defunding Obama's signature health care plan, known as Obamacare, even though he was against the idea himself. Ultimately, that tactic failed. But wrangling with the tea party isn't his only challenge. His members range from the rebellious Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, who publicly rebuked Boehner by calling instead for a ""bold"" leader, to Rep. Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey, a Republican who represents an urban, Democratic-leaning district. And they all have different agendas and different ideas of how to push back against a Democratic Senate and a Democratic President. Still, he needs their support -- he needs at least 217 of his 232 Republicans to pass a law -- because no Speaker wants to rely on members of the opposite party to pass legislation. That's the fastest way to lose power. But, this time, he had to do just that. The entire Democratic caucus in the House  -- 198 members, with two not voting -- voted ""yes"" on the bill to end the current crisis while 87 Republicans joined in to pass the law. And this isn't the first time he's had to rely on that formula. Republican shutdown pain may boost Dems in 2014 . The heavy lift . ""Until you've tried it, you cannot imagine the energy level it takes to try to do what Boehner is doing,"" Gingrich said. But the latest quagmire over government spending and the debt limit once again display Boehner's challenge. Early on, many said Boehner would never get conservative members of the GOP to acquiesce on federal spending and the debt ceiling, and would need Democrats to get anything through. Even when the stakes were highest and public opinion polling against his efforts, Boehner still struggled. He straddled the GOP caucus and the President in negotiations, but ultimately fell short. As the tide was shifting and the Senate deal took shape earlier this week, Boehner made one last stab to get Republican demands attached to the bill. But he couldn't get consensus among the GOP and the effort collapsed late on Tuesday. ""It's a very severe problem if he gets beaten ... and if he gets beaten publicly,"" Gingrich said. Instead of losing, Boehner simply didn't hold the vote. Cruz: Senate Republicans should have followed House Republicans . He's lost before . But this wasn't the first time Boehner came up short, struggling numerous times to find agreement. Last year, he was forced to pull a bill providing aid to Superstorm Sandy victims because he didn't have enough Republican support. And during the debt ceiling fight in 2011, spending cuts totaling $900 billion were not enough for some members of his caucus to agree to raise the debt ceiling. At the last moment he had to pull the bill and pull out of negotiations with the President. Obama blamed ""the extreme faction in his caucus"" for handcuffing Boehner. ""So there are been repeated situations where we have agreement and then he goes back and it turns out that he can't control his caucus,"" Obama said. Boehner and Obama have not successfully completed a negotiation. Other leaders, including Vice President Joe Biden, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have had to carry critical negotiations over the finish line. And Republicans got very little out of this deal. Obamacare is still law and government spending was not reduced. Furthermore, public opinion is blaming the GOP. CNN Poll: Americans to blame GOP for shutdown . Boehner the hero . Norman Ornstein, a Congressional expert with the American Enterprise Institute, said this saga has been a ""nightmare"" for Boehner. But he said his speakership is not yet over. ""He is shaken but not yet fallen,"" Ornstein said. ""I think that Boehner has listened to the American people,"" Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots said. One conservative group, Club for Growth, said they don't worry much about Boehner. ""We don't get a vote in who the Speaker of the House is,"" spokesperson Barney Keller said. 9 things we missed during the shutdown . The organization works to elect conservative members. They are notorious for running primary challengers against Republican incumbents who don't prove their conservative cred. ""If there are enough conservatives in the House, the direction of the House will take care of itself,"" Keller added. Until next time . The deal to reopen the government and lift the debt ceiling simply punts the same issues until early 2014. It's likely that a similar fight will happen again in a few months, once again pitting Boehner in the middle of his Republican caucus and Obama. In an interview on CNN's 'New Day,"" Senator Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, clearly said what a lot of people in Washington are thinking. ""Obviously, I don't envy the position that Speaker Boehner has been in,"" she said. A deal for now, but this year's been a legislative dud for Obama .","Boehner has seen his power tested in trying to corral conservatives .

"Republican Sen. Rand Paul could face a brutal battle against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, in the 2016 battle for the presidency. But on Thursday, the Kentucky senator extended his potential rival an olive branch. ""We would welcome Hillary Clinton (to help reform the criminal justice system), if she would like to come and help us promote this agenda,"" Paul told Wolf Blitzer on CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""I've been working with Sen. Cory Booker and other Democrats. If she wants to join me, we would welcome her support."" Earlier this year, Paul joined forces with Attorney General Eric Holder, to re-examine the way law enforcement sentences people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses. In light of the recent verdict not to indict a white police officer in the chokehold death of an unarmed black man, Eric Garner, Paul said he is ""shocked"" that no statement has been delivered from the Staten Island police about whether the bystanding officers involved in the incident will continue to serve. ""I really think to calm down the reaction to this, one thing that could happen is for the police could say, 'This is unacceptable for a policeman and we can't have this type of an individual on the police force,'"" Paul said. Asked about comments he made Wednesday where he blamed the politician who created New York's high cigarette tax for Garner's death, Paul said the black market created by heavy taxation and regulation -- whether it be food, drugs or cigarettes -- forces police officers to arrest people for mostly menial, non-offensive crimes. Garner was arrested for selling tax-free cigarettes. ""There's a black market because we have made the price of cigarettes so onerous that people are going to sell it illegally,"" Paul said. ""I don't think it's justified what the police did but I also think it's bad policy that puts the police in an untenable position. ...So I think politicians are responsible for creating a situation and putting police in an untenable situation."" But ""there's no excuse for what happened,"" he said. Closing his interview, the likely presidential hopeful said he would probably decide 'in the springtime,"" about whether or not he will run in 2016, admitting that he is still going through family discussions and weighing his personal ""momentum.""","Sen.

"Moscow, Russia (CNN)  -- Russian investigators combing two subway stations attacked by female suicide bombers think Chechen rebels may have been behind the rush-hour strike that killed dozens of people. ""Our preliminary assessment is that this act of terror was committed by a terrorist group from the North Caucasus region,"" Alexander Bortnikov of the Federal Security Service said of the investigation at one of the blast sites. ""We consider this the most likely scenario, based on investigations conducted at the site of the blast,"" Bortnikov said. ""Fragments of the suicide bombers' body found at the blast, according to preliminary findings, indicate that the bombers were from the North Caucasus region."" Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said the ""terrorists"" responsible for the Moscow subway attacks Monday ""will be destroyed."" ""We are providing Moscow metro with additional CCTV cameras.

""It was a terrorist act carried out by the female suicide bombers,"" Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov said of the first and most lethal explosion, citing the Federal Security Service. ""They were specifically timed -- for ... the train was nearing the station -- to make the most damage."" Both stations reopened about 5 p.m. Moscow time, according to Veronica Molskaya from the Press Service of the Russian Emergencies Ministry. In St. Petersburg, three metro stations were shut as the result of a bomb scare. Millions of commuters use the Moscow metro system every day. An estimated 500,000 people were riding trains throughout the capital at the time of the attacks. It was unclear when the system would return to normal service, and the incident generated fear among commuters. ""I feel scared,"" one woman said on TV. ""I have to walk to get to work, because there is no way I'm going by Metro."" The attacks reverberated around the globe. U.S. President Obama condemned the ""outrageous acts"" and passed along his condolences. ""The American people stand united with the people of Russia in opposition to violent extremism and heinous terrorist attacks that demonstrate such disregard for human life,"" Obama said. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she will offer her condolences to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday in Ottawa, Canada, where the Group of Eight foreign ministers are meeting to plan for the June G8 meeting in Canada. ""This brutal assault on innocent civilians is another reminder that terrorism is a threat to peace-loving people everywhere and must be met with unwavering resolve,"" she said. ""Together with our G8 partners, we will discuss how to further strengthen international counter-terrorism coordination and cooperation."" State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Monday that there have been no reports of U.S. citizens killed in the Moscow attacks. The federal Transportation Security Administration said there is ""no specific or credible information indicating an imminent or current threat to U.S. transportation systems,"" even though some local authorities have decided to beef up security measures in some cities. New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said police are stepping up security in the New York City subway system. In Washington, Metro, the operator of the city's transit system, said it is expanding security in light of the Moscow attacks. Coincidentally, it had a terror drill this past weekend and is holding another one Monday. Why no subway is safe from terror .

"(CNN) -- If Vladimir Putin wanted to get America's attention, he's done a pretty good job. The Russian president's opinion piece arguing against military intervention in Syria, published on The New York Times' website late Wednesday, set off a flurry of reactions -- some outraged, some impressed, and some just plain bemused. Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez said the piece made him almost want to throw up, and House Speaker John Boehner said he was ""insulted."" Putin said he wrote the article ""to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders."" But he appeared to have raised some hackles with the last paragraph in which he disputed the idea of American exceptionalism. It was a reference to President Barack Obama's address on Tuesday night, in which he said that while America can't be a global cop, it ought to act when in certain situations. ""That's what makes us exceptional,"" Obama said. ""With humility, but with resolve, let us never lose sight of that essential truth."" Putin's answer to that? ""It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation,"" he wrote. World reaction . He concluded with the line, ""We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord's blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal."" The White House shrugged off the fuss around Putin's jabs at Obama, describing them as ""irrelevant."" Obama himself ignored a question about the op-ed on Thursday. His chief spokesman, Jay Carney, said that Putin has a right to his opinion, noting that America is an exceptional nation. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi questioned Putin's views on equality. ""What I found interesting was the closing -- when he says when we pray to God he judges us all - I don't know exactly what his words are but he says `we are all God's children.' I think that's great. I hope it applies to gays and lesbians in Russia as well,"" Pelosi said. Putin signed a law earlier this year that bans public discussion of gay rights and relationships where children might hear it. Violators can be fined and, if they are foreigners, deported. 'Hey Putin' There are others who took issue with Putin's view. ""Hey Putin, next time you wanna write a letter to convince America about something, how about you skip saying we're not exceptional? #rude,"" tweeted Sarah Rumpf, a political consultant in Texas. Is the U.S. really No. 1? Russia's wars . The Russian president also annoyed some people by warning against military action without U.N. Security Council approval. ""Man who launched military action in Georgia and Chechnya without UN say-so says wars without it are illegal?"" tweeted the journalist John Podhoretz. A report commissioned by the European Union said that Georgia illegally started the war with Russia in 2008 but that the Russian response, which involved occupying large parts of Georgian territory, also violated international law. The two wars between Russian forces and separatists in Chechnya are widely considered to be internal conflicts. Some Twitter users unearthed a previous op-ed that Putin wrote for the Times about the Chechen war in 1999. Putin, then the prime minister of Russia, struck a different tone in which he sought to explain Russia's military action. ""No government can stand idly by when terrorism strikes,"" he wrote. ""It is the solemn duty of all governments to protect their citizens from danger."" ""Not a word on UN or Pope or Int'l law,"" Philip Gourevitch, a staff writer at The New Yorker, commented about the 1999 article. (Putin mentions the pope in his op-ed this week as being among those opposed to a U.S. strike against Syria.) Senator's stomach turns . The overall tone of Putin's latest broadside was too much for Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who said he read the article at dinner on Wednesday. ""I almost wanted to vomit,"" he said. ""I worry when someone who came up through the KGB tells us what is in our national interests and what is not. It really raises the question of how serious the Russian proposal is."" But plenty of people seemed to think Putin had scored points against Obama. ""I think it's sad to see him acting with more common sense and humanity than Obama,"" said Ashton Blazer. ""Putin made a compelling, though disingenuous, case against military strikes. Its effectiveness shows how badly Pres Obama was outmaneuvered,"" tweeted Marc Lamont Hill. Power plays . Others saw it in less subtle terms. ""#Putin diplomatically serves it to Pres. Obama in the last paragraph. Can't believe the #nytimes ran this,"" wrote Mary F. Mueller. For some people, the tension between the two presidents has become a spectacle in its own right. ""Putin plays his next move on our very own NYTimes. This is almost getting as good as Breaking Bad,"" wrote Twitter user @MiketheEye. Others said the tone of the article brought to mind some of the famous photos of Putin in macho poses. ""Putin wrote his Times op-ed on an Underwood, shirtless, with hunting knife nearby,"" joked Chris Regan.","Vladimir Putin argues against U.S. military action on NY Times opinion piece .

"The U.S. Department of Agriculture has slapped the parent company of the ""Greatest Show on Earth"" with a record penalty for alleged animal welfare violations. Feld Entertainment Inc., which produces the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, has agreed to pay $270,000 for allegedly violating the Animal Welfare Act on several occasions from June 2007 to August 2011, according to a USDA news release. The USDA can levy fines of up to $10,000 per violation of the act. ""This settlement sends a direct message to the public and to those who exhibit animals that USDA will take all necessary steps to protect animals regulated under the Animal Welfare Act,"" Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in the release. Feld Entertainment officials settled in lieu of a hearing and agreed to implement new training protocols for any circus employees who handle animals, the statement said. ""We look forward to working with the USDA in a cooperative and transparent manner that meets our shared goal of ensuring that our animals are healthy and receive the highest quality care,"" Kenneth Feld, the company's CEO, said in a separate statement. As part of the settlement, the company admits no wrongdoing or violation of USDA policy. The settlement comes in the wake of a federal appeals court dismissal of a lawsuit against Feld Entertainment filed by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Animal Protection Institute. The lawsuit alleged that the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus is in violation of the Endangered Species Act and that the circus systematically abuses and exploits elephants by using metal bullhooks to guide and control the animals, as well as chaining their legs while they are not performing. The lawsuit was dismissed in October on the grounds that the two animal protection organizations did not have the standing to bring the lawsuit against Feld Entertainment because they could not establish legal ""injury"" to themselves.","Circus owner violated the Animal Welfare Act, regulators say .

"President Barack Obama is meeting with a bipartisan set of newly elected governors on Friday -- including one who's suing him. Obama has a 4:55 p.m. meeting in the Oval Office with incoming GOP Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, as well as the Republican victors in Illinois, Maryland and Massachusetts, the Democratic winners in Rhode Island and Pennsylvania, and Alaska's newly elected independent governor. Abbott is leading the 17-state legal challenge of Obama's recent executive action to halt deportations of the undocumented parents of U.S. citizens, arguing that immigration policy should be left in the hands of Congress. The meeting comes as part of Obama's outreach effort after Democrats were trounced in November's midterm elections. States could play a key role in cementing Obama's legacy. Three of the states that elected GOP governors -- Illinois, Maryland and Massachusetts -- operate, at least in part, their own health insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. Obama also met privately for an hour with the presumptive new Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, on Wednesday.

"When Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas got out of his car at the Capitol on Wednesday, he did not to go into the Senate where he works. He was on the House side to join a conservative rally to press their own GOP leaders to use the power of the purse to fight the president on immigration. Since the day Cruz was sworn in almost two years ago, he has proudly been a thorn in House Republican leaders' side -- urging them to put principle before practical politics. Last year the government shut down thanks to a strategy pushed by Cruz to tie defunding Obamacare to funding the government. But even then he didn't take the extra step, literally, to physically go to the House and, symbolically, put his thumb in the eye of House Speaker John Boehner. Today, he did. On his way to the podium, this reporter asked why he is inserting himself in what the House is doing. ""I don't agree with the premise of what you're saying,"" Cruz responded. ""Republicans campaigned saying if you elect us, if you elect a Republican Senate, we will stop President Obama's illegal acts. These elections were a referendum. The American people overwhelmingly said they do not support a lawless amnesty created by the President. What I'm urging Republicans to do is -- do what we said we would do -- honor the commitments of the American voters,"" Cruz continued. GOP aims to avoid shutdown . Cruz wants House Republicans to attach a policy rider to the bill funding the government that denies the President his executive action allowing some 5 million undocumented workers legal status. But since the government runs out of money on Dec. 11, leaders in both chambers don't want to have that fight right now. Instead they want to pass a bill funding most of the government for a year, and only fund the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration laws, for a few months.  They're hoping that will buy them time to find an option to fight the President, even while conceding there are no good options. Frustrated House GOP leadership aides argue that Cruz pushing to have a fight now is disingenuous because it is unwinnable. The Senate is still run by Democrats and they will not pass a bill effectively canceling out the president's executive authority, never mind that the president would never sign such a bill even if he got it. 'Cromnibus' looms over Obama- McConnell meeting . When asked about this GOP criticism, and concern that his strategy could once again lead to a government shutdown, Cruz balked. ""No it's not. And it only will if Harry Reid decides he wants a shutdown, which it seems Harry Reid and President Obama are very eager about that prospect.""","Ted Cruz rallied House conservatives against a proposed plan to avoid a government shutdown .

"(CNN) -- The oil disaster plaguing the Gulf of Mexico and our coastal states puts our desperate need for a new clean energy economy in stark relief. We need to move away from dirty, dangerous and deadly energy sources. We are pleased that the White House is now saying it will suspend any new offshore drilling while the explosion and spill are investigated, but there should be no doubt left that drilling will only harm our coasts and the people who live there. Taking a temporary break from offshore drilling is an important step, but it's not enough. We need to stop new offshore drilling for good, now. And then we need an aggressive plan to wean America from dirty fossil fuels in the next two decades. This BP offshore rig that exploded was supposed to be state-of-the-art. We've also been assured again and again that the hundreds of offshore drilling rigs along our beaches are completely safe. Now, we've seen workers tragically killed. We've seen our ocean lit on fire, and now we're watching hundreds of thousands of gallons of toxic oil seep toward wetlands and wildlife habitat. This rig's well is leaking 210,000 gallons of crude every day, wiping out aquatic life and smothering the coastal wetlands of Louisiana and Mississippi. As the reeking slick spreads over thousands of square miles of ocean, it rapidly approaches the title of worst environmental disaster in U.S. history, even worse than 1989's Exxon Valdez oil spill. The well is under 5,000 feet of water, and it could take weeks or even months to cap it. This disaster could unfortunately happen at any one of the hundreds of drilling platforms off our coasts, at any moment. It could happen at the drilling sites that the oil industry has proposed opening along the beaches of the Atlantic Coast. Indeed, even before this spill, the oil and gas industry had torn apart the coastal wetlands of the Louisiana Bayou over the years. These drilling operations have caused Louisiana to lose 25 square miles of coastal wetlands, which are natural storm barriers, each year. Another view: Why it won't be easy to replace fossil fuels . And it's hardly just the environmental costs of oil spills that we have to worry about with offshore drilling. The threat to the people who work on these platforms has again become terribly clear. In fact, more than 500 fires on oil platforms in the Gulf have injured or killed dozens of workers in just the past four years, according to the federal Minerals Management Service. We don't need to pay this price for energy. We have plenty of clean energy solutions in place that will end our dependence on dirty fossil fuels, create good, safe jobs and breathe new life into our economy. One huge example came Thursday, when the Obama administration approved our country's first offshore wind farm. Our country has huge solar power potential as well. We can also save more oil through simple efficiency measures than could be recovered by new drilling on our coastlines. This oil spill changes everything. We have hit rock-bottom in our fossil fuel addiction. This tragedy should be a wake-up call. It's time to take offshore drilling off the table for good. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Brune.","Gulf spill can have devastating effect on wildlife and shoreline, says Michael Brune .

"So much for old-fashioned air conditioning: What if you could harness the universe to cool your house? Some Stanford University engineers may have figured out how to do just that. According to a paper in the scientific journal Nature, a team led by Stanford electrical engineer Shanhui Fan has come up with a material that can radiate heat away from buildings and send it directly into space. The wafer-thin material -- just 1.8 microns thick, about 50 times thinner than a piece of paper -- is made up of layers of silicon dioxide and hafnium oxide on top of a layer of silver. It both acts as a mirror, reflecting sunlight back into space, and channels invisible, heat-bearing infrared rays away from the source and into the universe. ""Think about it like having a window into space,"" Fan told the Stanford Report. The Stanford team calls it ""photonic radiative cooling,"" and if the material is applied to surfaces such as rooftops, it could help lower the need for air conditioning. In tests, the material was capable of cooling a surface by 5 degrees Celsius (about 9 degrees Fahrenheit). ""This team has shown how to passively cool structures by simply radiating heat into the cold darkness of space,"" Nobel Prize-winning physicist Burton Richter, a Stanford professor emeritus, told the Stanford Report. The scientists note that air conditioning currently accounts for about 15% of energy usage in buildings. Moreover, in rural and undeveloped areas, the material could provide a cooling technology that doesn't require electricity, observes Aaswath Raman, who was part of the research team. ""Across the developing world, photonic radiative cooling makes off-grid cooling a possibility in rural regions, in addition to meeting skyrocketing demand for air conditioning in urban areas,"" he told the Stanford Report. There are still obstacles, of course. The team believes production of the material can be ramped up into rooftop-appropriate sizes, but right now it exists only as a relatively small prototype. Moreover, the researchers are uncertain how to conduct heat from a building's interior to the material so it can be sent into space. But the scientists are optimistic. After all, the universe is vast and very, very cold: about 3 degrees above absolute zero, to be precise. Radiating our heat directly into space could help solve a number of problems on Earth, Fan told the Stanford Report. ""Every object that produces heat has to dump that heat into a heat sink,"" he said. ""What we've done is to create a way that should allow us to use the coldness of the universe as a heat sink during the day.""","Stanford scientists create material that radiates heat into space .

"(CNN) -- Mariah Carey is known for her five-octave voice, her slinky dresses and her many hits, including ""All I Want for Christmas is You."" Unfortunately, she is also known for her tardiness. And her behavior this week at the Rockefeller Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony in New York won't do anything to help that reputation. Because of her history, NBC decided to tape Carey singing her holiday classic before a live audience Tuesday night, then air it Wednesday for the network's coverage of the 82nd annual Rockefeller Center tree lighting. But the self-titled Queen of Christmas kept the audience waiting for three hours Tuesday before NBC made the decision to cancel the performance. According to TMZ, Carey was delayed because she was meeting with her lawyer about her divorce settlement with husband Nick Cannon. Carey took to Twitter to apologize for failing to show up. But some fans were already annoyed. Her no-show forced NBC to air Carey singing ""All I Want for Christmas is You"" live during its broadcast of the tree-lighting Wednesday night. The diva was on time, but many observers are saying her performance was less than stellar. Decked out in a tight red gown before a backdrop of costumed children, Carey seemed winded and had trouble hitting some of her trademark high notes. A clip of Carey's raw microphone feed, without backing instrumentation, also was leaked to YouTube -- and probably did not do her any favors. Twitter lit up during and after, with most of the tweets admonishing the singer for a lackluster performance. Still, some fans rallied to her side.

"(CNN) -- After Michael Brown was killed, the chorus was loud among those who felt video evidence would illuminate what happened between the unarmed teen and Officer Darren Wilson on August 9. They asked: Why didn't Wilson have a body camera? Following the grand jury's Wednesday decision not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who, on camera, used a chokehold on Eric Garner that's banned by the New York Police Department, a different question emerged: What's the point? President Barack Obama has called for 50,000 body cameras for police officers. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has called for officers to wear them as well, but skeptics were out in force on Twitter after the grand jury's decision in Garner's death. ""Body cameras on cops aren't going to change anything."" one person wrote. ""There was clear footage of this cop killing Eric Garner, cop still wasn't indicted."" ""Introducing police body cameras will do nothing,,, this WAS on camera!"" read another tweet. Asked about Obama's plan, Garner's dad, Ben Carr, also expressed doubt, telling CNN, ""Throwing money away. Video didn't matter here."" Camera phone footage shows Garner, whom police accused of illegally selling single cigarettes, arguing with two officers. The 350-pound man tells the police he's minding his business. He's clearly upset, gesticulating as he accuses officers of previous harassment. ""I'm tired of it. This stops today,"" he tells them. ""I did not sell nothing."" As the two officers reach for his arms to make an arrest, he pulls away, telling them, ""Don't touch me."" Pantaleo administers the chokehold after two more officers appear, and within nine seconds, they take Garner to the ground. A fifth officer joins the fray as Pantaleo forces Garner's head into the sidewalk, eliciting repeated, muffled cries from the 43-year-old, ""I can't breathe. I can't breathe."" Garner later died. When it was announced Pantaleo wouldn't be indicted, people took to Twitter to question the usefulness of body cameras if a grand jury won't indict an officer who was caught on video using a maneuver banned by his own police department. This is an even more pointed question when you consider a statistic from the department's own Civilian Complaint Review Board: Despite the NYPD banning chokeholds in the 1990s, New York officer was accused of putting someone in a chokehold, on average, every other day from 2009 through the first half of 2014 (you can see the numbers for yourself on page 55 of the board's report). Of those 1,048 complaints, the review board substantiated only 10, and at the time of the board's report, only one officer had been charged and only one had been disciplined, with a ""loss of up to 10 days of vacation"" (three of the 10 were still ""pending disposition"" at the time of the report). Following Brown's shooting, body cameras became cause du jour. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, said in August that if local police agencies want to qualify for federal funding, their officers should be required to wear body cameras, and Obama said he would ask for $263 million that would, in part, provide police departments with the recording devices. CNN and CNNMoney ran numerous stories under headlines such as: . -- ""Can cell phones stop police brutality?"" -- ""No dashcams in Ferguson: One less tool in Michael Brown shooting investigation"" -- ""Post-Ferguson, more police uniforms include cameras"" -- ""Can technology prevent another Ferguson?"" Yet all this clamoring to put cameras on officers' lapels ignores that police use of force has remained relatively static despite the increasing popularity of camera phones over the years. Cell phone companies began equipping their devices with cameras in the United States in 2002. They've proliferated since, but according to Bureau of Justice Statistics, reports of police using force or threatening to use force barely budged, from 1.5% of those who had contact with police in 2002, to 1.6% in 2005, to 1.4% in 2008. It important to note that juries are asked to hold police officers to a different standard than civilians. In 1989, the Supreme Court decided in Graham v. Connor that a police officer's use of force should be ""analyzed under the Fourth Amendment's 'objective reasonableness' standard, rather than under a substantive due process standard,"" under which the average American's actions would be gauged. The ruling requires juries to determine whether an officer's actions were ""'objectively reasonable' in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation."" It also demands juries consider that a ""reasonable officer"" is ""forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of force necessary in a particular situation."" Twenty-two months later, the country watched home video of four Los Angeles police officers using a stun gun on Rodney King and hitting him more than 50 times with batons. In April 1992, an all-white jury acquitted three of the officers, while it was hung on the fate of the fourth officer, resulting in a mistrial. Fast-foward to 2014, and in addition to Garner's death you have more instances in which seemingly excessive force caught on tape didn't result in a conviction for the accused officer. A grand jury declined to indict an Ohio police officer who killed 22-year-old John Crawford III in August as he walked through a Beavercreek Wal-Mart carrying an air rifle. The Albuquerque, New Mexico, Police Department stood by officers who in March shot a mentally disturbed, homeless 38-year-old, James Boyd, in the back after hours of negotiation in which Boyd wielded two small camping knives. Police then released a dog and fired bean bags at him as he gasped for breath. A county and federal investigation are ongoing. Police in Hammond, Indiana, also stood by officers who smashed the passenger window of a car and used a stun gun on Jamal Jones in September after pulling over his partner, Lisa Mahone, for a seat belt violation. Police say Jones refused to identify himself and exit the car, leading them to believe he was armed. At the same time, there are instances in which police departments did not stand by their officers when cameras captured what appears to be excessive force. ""Why did you shoot me?"" begged Levar Jones, 35, in September after a South Carolina state trooper asked him for his driver's license and opened fire when he reached into his car for it. Sean Groubert was fired and charged with aggravated assault and battery, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division said. A witness said Saratoga County, New York, Deputy Shawn Glans hit a man in the head last month after the man told him he didn't want his car searched. Glans was caught on tape cursing at the man and telling the witness, who recorded parts of the incident, ""I'll rip your f***ing head off."" Glans, who has resigned, was charged with official misconduct and second-degree harassment. The facts, along with these incidents -- and the disparity in how the cases were handled -- don't appear to provide a solid answer on whether body cameras are the answer to curbing excessive uses of force by police in America. In fact, they seem to demonstrate that these are complicated issues that won't likely be resolved by a simple camera on a cop's lapel. CNN's Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.","Missouri senator, President Barack Obama lead calls for police body cameras .

"Two years after Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe unveiled his plan to finally break the country's economy free from more than 20 years of under-performance, the much-hoped-for renaissance has not filtered down to everyone. Standing near a 100-meter long queue for lottery tickets in Tokyo's wealthy Ginza district, 34-year-old nurse Mihoko Aoki is still waiting for proof that it is working. ""I hear that Abenomics is bringing merit to big companies, but for small companies like my husband's one, there is no benefit,"" she says. ""And for me as a nurse there are no benefits either."" There are changes but, for her, not good ones. She notes that the price of food has gone ""up and up"" over the past year and that life for her is starting to get tight. ""I wish that Abenomics would bring my quality of life up, because at the moment it's just the rich people who are getting the benefits."" A 78-year-old man standing nearby, who would only give his name as Mr. Hirano, agreed. ""They say that employment is getting better, but all I see is the price of things going up, and that is hurting me."" But rising prices is actually one of the key targets of Abenomics. After more than a decade of deflation, where prices fell and consumers held back from spending in the hope they would fall further, a combination of pumping money through the system and cutting the value of the yen which makes imports more expensive, is having the desired affect. READ MORE: Abe's election gamble puts policies on the line . Japanese are getting out and spending more and prices are rising. Or at least they were -- until a new consumption tax was introduced in April which not only stopped spending in its tracks, but sent the economy into recession. To be fair, the tax was a hangover from a previous government, but Abe's Liberal Democratic Party did support it. But there are still plenty of winners from Abenomics. Shuhei Yeda is a 37-year-old construction company employee. He says that his salary is up 3% this year and he is now getting fat bonuses as a result of the government-backed boom in construction. ""I am getting a big boost from Abenomics. We don't have enough people for all the work,"" he says. Certainly, the unemployment rate in Japan is the envy of the developed world at under 3%. Companies are on a hiring spree as the yen weakens and exports become more competitive. At home, the service industry is also booming. According to JP Morgan's managing director and head of research, Jesper Koll, 130,000 jobs a month have been created since Abenomics kicked off. ""The key issue is whether the economy is creating jobs, and the answer is absolutely yes. On top of that you have corporates making more money, they have basically doubled, so you have employment up and profit up and consumer sentiment on the rise."" But there are still plenty of Japanese who are not a part of this picture. And they are they people that Abe needs to convince if he is to stay in power.","Two years after its introduction, Abenomics is yet to benefit all Japanese .

"Last December 5, just after 7 p.m. South African time, I got a text message from one member of Nelson Mandela's family. ""It's imminent."" And so that's how I knew a great man was taking his final breaths. ""It's done,"" said the next message from those who were with him at the end. It was 9 p.m. and Nelson Mandela was gone. By that stage, we were all in the CNN bureau and ready to go live, to tell the world Mandela was gone. However, I had made a promise to my sources that I would not go to air with any information they gave me about his condition until there were an official announcement by President Jacob Zuma. We waited. The televised address to the nation came just before midnight. It was a long wait, but I was so grateful to his family for trusting me with the information -- those three hours of preparation allowed me the time and space to clear my head. I am a South African, a white South African whose country was changed for the better by his visionary leadership. I had my own personal thanks to give for Mandela's life. Then I had the responsibility of delivering this news to CNN's global audience. That task continued for the next 11 days until he was buried in the rural hills around his boyhood home in Qunu, Eastern Cape. The immediate days after Mandela's passing created a wonderful celebratory mood in the country -- strange as it might have seemed to others. For South Africans, it was the most natural reaction. Sadness and mourning had been done already in the months before, when he was critically ill. Now, South Africans gave thanks, paused in gratefulness and came together in ways that reflected the debt they owed to this one man. White, black, old, young gathered outside his house in Johannesburg, laying flowers and saying a personal prayer of thanks. It was astounding to watch. The manicured pavement lawns of suburban Houghton became like an altar of reflection for a time of hope and reconciliation that seemed like an age away. It was called ""Mandela Magic""-- and now that he was gone it felt like the 'magic' that had sustained a battered, racist nation would go with him. It was always an ephemeral, false even, suggestion that Mandela saved South Africa. South Africans did it together, he just led them on the right path. Still, older South Africans brought their children, some just babies wrapped in blankets, to his home in the days after he died. Often, they dressed the kids up in their best clothes, like they were going to church, and solemnly walked to the piles of flowers on the sidewalk or loitered by the exterior walls. It was as if a whole generation of South Africans wanted their kids to feel and breathe in that last little bit of ""Mandela Magic.' There was an important sense of occasion, a primal need to 'be there.' At times, I watched families appear quietly outside Mandela's home and silently soak up the atmosphere. Other times, I felt like I was watching worshipers presenting gifts to a deity, pushing forward toddlers and young kids to the front of crowds just so their children could be closer to the place where he died. In years to come, a new generation of children will be able to say, ""I was there. I said goodbye."" Mandela's funeral was a measure of the man. I watched from inside the funeral tent and thought how apt it was that his goodbye was both about pageantry and plain-speaking. I stood by his casket as it made the final journey and softly said goodbye and thank you as that great man was laid to rest on a simple grass mat, as he had wished.","CNN journalist recalls Nelson Mandela's death, nation's response .

"(CNN) -- London's new superyacht hotel is so enormous that when it first arrived in the city, authorities had to lower the water level by five meters just to fit it under a bridge. They even took the mast off the whopping vessel so it could squeeze underneath a motorway, with a gasp-inducing five centimeters to spare. The mast has now been reattached -- not that this five-storey floating hotel is going anywhere soon -- it doesn't even have an engine. ""It took two weeks to tow it here from Finland,"" explains Elzbieta Nowacka, Sunborn events and sales manager, during a tour of the 102-meter-long boat. ""To install an engine would have cost another Â£25 million ($44 million), so it was built without one on purpose."" Float your boat . The swanky superyacht now sits on the banks of east London's Royal Victoria Docks, and come late August it hopes to open its 136 rooms to the public, costing between $300 and $1,600 per night. Originally floating in conjunction with a luxury spa hotel in Finland, the vessel was given a refurbishment and tugged to the UK -- at a total cost of $67 million. ""You cannot refer to these rooms as simply cabins,"" says Nowacka, opening the door to one of the top-of-the-range executive suites, featuring its own sauna and a balcony big enough for 20 people. ""Not everybody can afford to go cruising on a superyacht, so this is a way of giving them a taste of how it could be."" Stepping inside the plush lobby I'm greeted with a golden staircase, the twinkling light from the water outside reflected on its buffered surface. ""A lot of people say it reminds them of the Titanic staircase,"" says Nowacka. ""We've had quite a few requests from clients for Titanic-themed events,"" she adds, without a hint of irony. Space race . In a place with some of the most expensive property prices in the world, the Sunborn Superyacht Hotel has turned its gaze to London's many waterways -- and it's not the first European city in the company's sights. The company opened its $200 million Gibraltar hotel earlier this year, moored in the tiny territory located off the southern tip of Spain. There are also plans for another five-star ship in Barcelona. ""I think it is definitely the future of design, because there are so many cities with large marinas and rivers that could be used as well,"" said Nowacka. ""You can see it especially in central London, where we are running out of space in terms of building new hotels."" The London berth has been leased for the next 15 years, with views of looming skyscrapers, and the low roar of airplanes from nearby City Airport overhead. Step out onto the decking and it almost feels as though the planes are about to land right on board, and Nowacka is quick to point out the double-glazed windows render it silent inside. The hotel itself is attached to the land by two huge supporting arms, and connected to the electricity and sewerage mains. ""You cannot feel any movement, maybe eight millimeters, but it's impossible to feel seasick,"" says Nowacka, as we take in the view from the third-storey deck, the summer glare bouncing off the water. Energized East End? Decades ago, this part of London was a very different place. What was once one of the busiest ports in the world had become a deserted wasteland by 1980. So much so that the grim image of a ruined city was the perfect setting for Stanley Kubrick's 1987 Vietnam war film ""Full Metal Jacket."" It wasn't until the London Docklands Development Corporation redeveloped the site towards the end of the decade -- including the financial hub of Canary Wharf -- that the area was reborn. ""This superyacht hotel creates a new set of symbols for the area -- in terms of the wealth it represents, it's a huge change, "" said Georgina Young, senior curator at the Museum of London. ""Now it's all about service and luxury, so it's a very different idea of the Docklands. Much like London itself has moved from an industry economy to a service-based economy.""

"New York (CNN) -- The gate crashers Michaele and Tareq Salahi want to be famous as stars of reality television. I am all for that. Give them a reality television series and call it ""Trial and Jailtime"" in the D.C. criminal justice system. This despicable, desperate, duplicitous couple disgraced the Secret Service and embarrassed the president in his home. They totally overshadowed the president's meeting with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the leader of an important ally. The incident made the Obamas' first state dinner, honoring the prime minister and his wife, Gursharan Kaur, fodder for comedians -- and it certainly raises security concerns for other world leaders visiting at later dates. The gate-crashers need to be held accountable and not glorified. Unless they have some excuse we haven't heard yet, the Salahis deserve to be charged with criminal trespassing and lying to federal officers for starters. Yes, they dressed for the occasion, but the Salahis are no different, and shouldn't be regarded any differently, than a nut case who jumps over the White House fence and tries to run in the front door. The only difference is that the fence-jumper would be shot ten feet from his entrance point. I worked in a couple of White Houses and have always had the greatest respect for the Secret Service. These men and women put their lives on the line daily and often serve in long and tedious tours of duty. I worked in the White House when President Reagan was shot and I saw the extraordinary bravery of Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy, who was critically wounded when he took a bullet in the stomach after turning and putting his body between the president and the shooter, John Hinckley. But for all the bravery of its agents, the Secret Service lives in a world that demands zero defects. So I have to tell you I am appalled at the comments by the Secret Service spokesman who was described as saying it hadn't been determined whether party-crashing is technically illegal. He went on to say he didn't believe the Salahis posed a security risk. Spin control is not needed now. Responsibility is the key word. Trespassing is illegal. How does the Secret Service know whether the Salahis were a risk or not? The service apparently had not done a background check on them -- unlike every other guest and government employee in the tent that night -- because they weren't on the invitation list. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan issued a rare apology, saying the service took full responsibility for the episode and was ""deeply concerned and embarrassed."" Not good enough! He needs to determine who was responsible for letting the Salahis onto the White House grounds and fire whoever it was, before he thinks about offering his own resignation. Public servants have to be held accountable and now is a good time to start. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has fired some of the top people in the military because they were not performing at the level he expected. Can Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, whose department oversees the Secret Service, expect any less? Can an agency, Homeland Security, that has responsibility for securing our borders be trusted if it cannot even secure the White House? We live in a world of reality television in which egotists try to be famous for three minutes and land an appearance on the talk shows. The bigger question is what example this sets for our kids. If we glorify the actions of people like the Salahis and don't hold them accountable, how do we teach our kids what is right and what is wrong? The Salahis claim there's more to the story. Their lawyer says they weren't crashing the party, but the Secret Service says otherwise. Based on the facts as we know them so far, there's a simple way to deal with this case. Charge them, prosecute them, and if a D.C. jury finds them guilty, jail them. Make an example out of them. Then next November when the president is pardoning the Thanksgiving turkey, he can pardon them too. And after the pardon, as is traditional for the turkeys whose lives are spared, they can go live in Disney World -- a fantasy world that seems to be the perfect place for this pair. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Rollins.","The White House said an uninvited couple crashed the state dinner .

"(CNN) -- Over 300 miles from the nearest ocean, competitors in one of the world's fastest sailing races are battling against a moody wind. A small army of boats -- if you can call them that -- carve across the Nevada desert. A stream of sand billows behind, caking each competitor's face in fine, white grit. ""It's like Mother Nature has her foot on the throttle,"" says Russ Foster, who has been racing these peculiar yachts-on-wheels since the 1970s. ""The speeds that you go at -- sometimes 100 miles per hour -- means that you really need to stay on top of it or you could have a major accident,"" he tells CNN's Mainsail show. ""But that's part of the challenge."" Dramatic backdrop . Each year the dried lake-bed of Smith Creek is transformed into a fantastical racetrack for the Landsailing World Championships. Over 170 ""sailors,"" from countries as far flung as Chile and New Zealand, converge on the dramatic landscape that stretches flat as a mirror beneath the sweltering summer sun. ""When we first came through the mountains, we saw these beautiful big rocks, and the west end of the lake was just glass smooth,"" competitor Rod Eicholz says of the spectacular setting. ""So smooth you can actually see the reflection of your boat on the dirt,"" adds fellow racer Kurt Smiley. Situated around 30 miles from the closest town of Austin -- which has a population of just 200 -- Smith Creek appears like a scorched land on the edge of the world. And when the temperamental wind whips up the sand, forcing spectators to shield their eyes and run for cover, you'd be forgiven for thinking these otherworldly sailboats were ghost ships on the horizon. Desert inventors . Competitors arrive in campervans loaded with their desert-racing machines, and work late into the evening tinkering with their speedy designs. ""You know what a sailboat is? Well it's kind of like that, but you're racing on dirt, with wheels,"" racer John Eisenlohr says matter-of-factly. ""The amount of time you spend in what I call a 'dirt boat coma' with a glazed look in your eye, thinking about your next great innovation and hoping it works..."" he trails off with a faraway look. In their everyday lives, these enthusiasts might be farmers or plumbers who work on their designs in garages back home. The boats differ dramatically according to the class they're racing in -- from basic buggies with sails, to something resembling a futuristic bobsled with wheelie arms extended either side. ""Just after the start, you push, you run, you jump into the yacht, and you lay down completely, trying to be the lowest you can,"" explains racer J.P Krischer. ""You're hunkered down in the boat, you get nice and low, and you just get a beautiful view of the horizon,"" says fellow competitor Lester Robertson. The high-tech designs have come a long way from the 1970s, when adventurous land sailors tested out their hybrid designs everywhere from European beaches to North African deserts. ""It's progressed from small, simple, two-framed vehicles, to pretty exotic ones with carbon fiber bodies and wing masts,"" explains Foster, who previously raced go-karts and catamarans. ""Then there are some classes which were designed in the 1970s and haven't changed at all."" Need for speed . The majority of world championship winners hail from the U.S. but there's also a good showing from European competitors, who are perhaps better used to racing on more rugged beach terrain. For North American Land Sailing Association (NALSA) president Dennis Bassano, there's a good reason why he keeps coming back year after year. ""It's the speed. It's just so much fun to go that fast with the wind. You're in a boat, making all the decisions you're in control of everything. ""And heck,"" he adds, ""who doesn't like going 80 miles an hour?""

"(CNN) -- Elections have consequences. That's the message of Monday's rulings from the Supreme Court -- and, indeed, all decisions by nine justices whose ideologies reflect, with considerable precision, the views of the presidents who appointed them. Both the Hobby Lobby case -- which concerned the intersection of women's rights, religious freedom, and Obamacare -- and the Harris case, about the future of labor unions, were 5-4 decisions. Five Republican appointees for the owners of Hobby Lobby (and against the unions). Four Democratic appointees for the Obama administration (and for the unions). Notably, too, three of those four Democratic appointees are women. (Of 112 people who have served on the Supreme Court, four have been women.) As in so many cases before the justices, the legal issues in these cases were as much political as legal. Indeed, just like politicians, the justices try to frame the questions before them in as politically appealing ways as they can. In Hobby Lobby, the issue was whether a privately held company, whose owners have strong religious convictions against abortion, can refuse to pay for certain forms of birth control which they regard as immoral. ""The owners of many closely held corporations could not in good conscience provide such coverage,"" Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority, and to force them to do so would violate federal law. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for the dissenters, framed the issue in an entirely different way. She and her colleagues saw Hobby Lobby as asking for -- and receiving -- a license from the court to discriminate against women. What, she asked, about companies that have religious objections to treating African-Americans equally -- or gay people? And, she asks, ""how does the Court divine which religious beliefs are worthy of accommodation, and which are not?"" The same kind of conflict undergirds the union case. In that case, home care workers who are covered by a union contract demanded the freedom to refuse to pay dues -- which the conservative majority granted them. Is this, as Alito (again) held, simply a matter of preserving the freedom of speech rights of these employees? Or is it, as the dissenters, led by Justice Elena Kagan, said, a vehicle to starve unions of the dollars they need to survive -- and negotiate precisely these kinds of contracts? Toward the end of this year's term, there were more unanimous opinions than usual -- including rulings about the right of police officers to search the personal electronic devices of persons under arrest, and about the legitimacy of the use of recess appointments by the Obama administration. But no one should be misled. When it comes to the most fundamental issues before the court, the most important factor is not the legal arguments but the identity of the judges -- and the presidents who appointed them. Republicans vote one way, Democrats another. It's true in Congress, and it's true on the other side of First Street as well -- in the marble temple of the United States Supreme Court.","Jeffrey Toobin: Court rulings reflect ideology of presidents who appointed each justice .

"What if the world's most distinguished human rights organization decided to condone pimping? Unthinkable, right? But that's what happened when Amnesty International put forth a document calling for the legalization of prostitution. For 50 years, the global women's movement has been fighting the selling and buying of human beings, which has a name: slavery. For decades, feminists called for criminalizing the buyers while decriminalizing the women they buy; offering women support services ranging from safe harbor through drug rehabilitation to education and skills training; and enforcing laws that criminalize pimps, traffickers and brothel owners. The response was that it would never work (and feminists were crazy, sex-hating Puritans). The sex industry fought back, both openly -- It's the ""oldest profession, always been with us"";  it represents ""sexual liberation""  -- and covertly, through funding happy-hooker-type groups, rebranding prostitution as ""sex work,"" and praising it as a career choice indistinguishable from any other. Have you ever met an 8-year-old who said, ""Ooh, I wanna grow up to be a hooker""? The numbers of prostituted women who suffer post-traumatic stress disorder are in the same range as combat veterans  and refugees from state sponsored torture. They are also disproportionately survivors of child sexual and physical abuse, rape and battery, kidnapping, assault with a deadly weapon, and addiction to drugs and/or alcohol. Vednita Carter, a survivor activist, has noted that every prostituted woman has been forced, whether or not she seems to ""choose willingly."" Racism, violence and poverty are ever present forms of coercion in the sex industry; consequently, poor women and women of color have a disproportionately large presence. And we're only now discovering the enormous impact of prostitution on women in native communities. As the survivors succinctly depict it:   $ Does Not = Consent. There is, as Kathleen Barry pointed out in her classic, ""The Prostitution of Sexuality,"" a single interrelated mega-enterprise of sexual exploitation. We know the trajectory of, say, a young runaway from an abusive home: First, the offer of work in ""films."" Then, the ""temporary"" turning of a trick or two, which becomes  a permanent deployment in prostitution. Finally, she finds herself being moved around as a trafficked commodity. Despite this reality, the phrase ""sex work"" became fashionable among some well-meaning people who assumed that this term meant respect for the women involved -- when actually it signifies approval for the context in which such women were trying to stay barely alive, or from which they were trying to escape. Nevertheless, progress seemed possible. Sweden, Norway, and Iceland passed legislation holding customers responsible for buying human beings for sex, criminalizing the buyers and offering the women support programs. This is  known as the Nordic Model. The French parliament voted last December to follow Sweden's model; similar laws are pending in the parliaments of Belgium, Ireland, Scotland and Canada, and the European Parliament favored it with a strongly affirmative vote on February 24, 2014. See, the model works. Since Sweden began enforcement, street prostitution has been reduced almost by half and trafficking has declined.  This unglues the arguments of those who treat trafficking as a separate issue from ""sex work."" Is it less enslaving to be bought in your own country rather than another? Contrarily, countries with legalized prostitution have greater inflows of human trafficking, according to a study published in ScienceDirect. Then, just when it seemed sanity was winning, the respected human rights organization Amnesty International appears to have come out on the side of the sex industry. An Amnesty International document, ""Decriminalization of Sex Work,"" argues that pimps and johns should be ""free from government interference"" and allowed to ""exercise their autonomy."" It says governments have an obligation to establish an environment where pimps can operate freely to engage prostituted people; to do otherwise ""threatens the rights to health, nondiscrimination, equality, privacy, and security of persons."" The document also insults the disability community by claiming that men with disabilities require access to prostituted women to further their sense of ""life enjoyment and dignity."" Amnesty International has argued that the document is a draft and is in the discussion stage.  But Amnesty International representatives appeared at the Northern Ireland Assembly in January, lobbying to strike down proposed legislation that would criminalize customers for buying prostituted women. What's even more stunning is that a former member of Amnesty, is proudly claiming credit for having first raised the issue of legalizing pimps and brothel owners at the organization, which he says resulted in the policy recommendation. A campaigner for the International Union of Sex Workers  who and calls himself a  ""sex worker"", he and his partner run a major escort service. Amnesty, however, denies his involvement in the draft document, saying he had ""zero input.""   Amnesty came to this on its own, then? Hard to know which is worse. It took decades for the global women's movement to convince Amnesty that human rights were not reserved for male people. Now, Amnesty International London has set things back by considering a shocking violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But this time, the ""crazy, puritanical feminists"" can't be dismissed; we're backed by national governments who've proved our point—and saved women's lives. This time survivors must be heard. On March 8,  a mass protest will be held at Amnesty International's London headquarters, and a worldwide virtual protest is building online. A global petition to Amnesty and a Facebook page called Virtual Protest of Amnesty International has full information. We hope Amnesty will regain its soul  -- and realize that survivors' rights are women's rights are human rights.","Amnesty International put forth a document calling for the legalization of prostitution .

"A country's economy devastated, unemployment endemic and suicides rising -- this is the reality in Greece, and there is seemingly no end in sight. Greece -- the birthplace of democracy -- is now reliant on eurozone bailouts and subject to political decision-making in Brussels and Berlin. In October, Athenians marched in the streets to make it clear German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- in her first visit to the Greek capital since 2009 -- was not welcome. Read more: EU leaders agree on bank oversight . Merkel met with Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras to assess the country's economic health as it attempts to drive through more austerity measures to secure further bailout money. In her brief visit, she pledged German support for Greece but made it clear that Greece cannot -- and therefore will not -- yield on its austerity reforms. Rooftop snipers and 7,000 Greek police were deployed to keep the protests under control. Protesters bearing swastika flags were kept away from Syntagma Square, the focal point for demonstrators during the crisis. It was here, six-months ago, that a Greek pensioner took his own life outside parliament citing austerity measures for his desperation. The talks between Merkel and Samaras were just the latest episode between two countries with a fraught and tumultuous history. Postcard: Why Berlin, America are kindred spirits . Some demonstrators evoked bitter memories of the brutal Nazi occupation of Greece from 1941 to 1944, when thousands of Greeks were killed. It was only in 1951 that the European Union began to take shape through the Treaty of Paris and the European Steel and Coal Community. The treaty signed by six nations -- Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands -- was intended to create lasting economic and political stability for a continent ravaged by war. Three days after Merkel left Greece, the European Union won the Nobel Peace Prize for restoring harmony to much of Europe. Despite the award, relations between countries -- particularly in northern and southern Europe -- have been tested by the crisis. Spyros Economides, a senior lecturer in international relations and European politics at the London School of Economics, said Greeks are ""not very positive at all"" in their views toward Germany. He told CNN: ""Partly it's a generational thing for those who remember World War II and the consequences, but it's also younger people who are unemployed and suffering economic dislocation, which they pin squarely on other people's shoulders, in this case the Germans."" Read more: Thousands rally, Greece brought to standstill by anti-austerity strike . While the visit from Merkel -- intended to strengthen eurozone unity -- quashed any immediate fears of a '""Grexit"" from the euro, many in Europe wouldn't be disappointed to see them go, according to Economides. ""There will be a lot of people in the European institutions and national capitals around Europe who will say, if the Greeks decide to leave the eurozone, then so be it. Good riddance,"" he said. To stay, the Greeks are coming under intense pressure from eurozone peers --- led by Germany -- to implement further austerity measures of 13.5 billion euros [$17.7 billion]. Economides explained that the projected cuts could break down into 11.5 billion euros worth of cuts -- from pensions and wages as well as the sale of state property -- and the remaining 2 billion euros from additional taxes. The measures will ensure that international creditors supply the next 31 billion euro [$40.6 billion] tranche of bailout relief. This will allow the cash-strapped Greek government to meet its debt obligations beyond the end of November. But the clash between the two countries over the terms of Athens' bailout has led to feisty rhetoric from senior members of both German and Greek political parties. Frank Schaeffler, a German member of parliament in the Free Democratic Party, has previously advocated the sale of uninhabited Greek islands to fund creditor repayments. He told CNN that ""unfortunately"" the proper enforcement of a Greek adjustment program is an ""illusion."" Read more: Fears grow over EU banking union plan . Schaeffler said: ""I am afraid Germany has softened its stance on Greece lately ... Samaras himself has said that Greece is willing to sell off its uninhabited islands."" Former Greek Foreign Minister Stavros Dimas called the suggestion ""insulting,"" and said Germany should pay reparations for the damage and loss of life the country inflicted on Europe during the Second World War. He told fellow parliamentarians that Greece has never waived its right to claim reparations, including for the loan that Germany forced Greece to pay for its own occupation. He added: ""No one can erase the tragedies that our country suffered... They are engraved in our collective memory."" European leaders are meeting in Brussels this week to discuss the region's debt crisis, and policymakers will consider creating a separate budget for the 17-nation monetary union. Joerg Kraemer, chief economist at Commerzbank -- Germany's second largest bank -- told CNN: ""If Greece does not comply with the reforms and austerity, the troika (ECB, IMF and European Commission) should not recommend releasing fresh money, in pure economic terms."" Read more: Spain: Perils of being 'filthy stinking poor' Germany is concerned that a Greek exit from the eurozone could lead to a domino effect, whereby a number of indebted nations -- including Ireland, Portugal and potentially Spain and Italy -- may be forced to withdraw from the common currency, which could lead to a full break-up of the monetary union. Samaras' government is negotiating with the International Monetary Fund and the European Union over extending the cuts for another two years into 2014 and beyond. If achieved, Economides says this would represent a political victory for the coalition government, as it was elected partly on the promise of extending the timeframe to make the cuts. Kraemer added: ""I don't think Greece will be part of the eurozone in five or ten years but currently the politicians in Germany and elsewhere do not want to pull the plug.""","The Greek coalition government is seeking to push through budget cuts of 13.5 billion euros [$17.4 billion] .

"Killeen, Texas (CNN) -- An AWOL Muslim American Army private arrested near Fort Hood has told investigators that he wanted to attack fellow soldiers at the military post, the police chief in Killeen, Texas, said Thursday. ""Military personnel were a target of this suspect,"" Chief Dennis Baldwin told reporters about Pfc. Naser Jason Abdo, who is expected to face federal charges. Baldwin said Abdo, who was arrested Wednesday, had no accomplices, ""as far as I know."" He added, ""We are not aware of any additional threats to the safety of our community."" FBI agents discovered potential bomb-making materials in Abdo's hotel room, FBI spokesman Erik Vasys said. Abdo, 21, had refused to deploy to Afghanistan and later went AWOL from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, after being charged with possession of child pornography, Vasys said. After a tip-off on Tuesday from a local gun shop, Killeen police arrested Abdo at a traffic stop, officials said. He was taken into custody without incident and is being held in Killeen City Jail. ""He's a very dangerous individual and he is where he needs to be,"" Baldwin said. Asked how close Abdo may have come to pulling off an attack, Baldwin said, ""I can tell you that we would probably be here today giving you a different briefing had he not been stopped."" Fort Hood is the Texas military post where a 2009 shooting spree left 13 people dead. Another Muslim American soldier, Maj. Nidal Hasan, has been charged in those killings. Killeen is also where, in 1991, George Hennard crashed his pickup into a Luby's cafeteria, fatally shot 23 people and wounded another 20 before killing himself. ""We've been through a lot in this community,"" Baldwin said. ""But I can tell you that's when the character of the community is more obvious."" ""Thanks to quick action by a Texas gun dealer in alerting local police to a suspicious character, and a prompt and vigorous response by the Killeen Police Department, we may well have averted a repeat of the tragic 2009 radical Islamic terror attack on our nation's largest military installation,"" said Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, the House Army Caucus chairman. ""We now have an example of what works to prevent these type attacks, and as the coming days reveal more details about this attempt, we can determine better ways to thwart similar efforts in the future,"" Carter said. Carter's office said Killeen gun shop Guns Galore, the same store used by Hasan to purchase weapons allegedly used in his attack, tipped off police concerning a ""suspicious male"" who purchased gunpowder, shotgun ammunition, and a magazine for a semiautomatic handgun. Greg Ebert, a retired police officer who works at Guns Galore, said a young man showed up in the store Tuesday afternoon and browsed for about 20 minutes. He selected six one-pound canisters of smokeless gunpowder, Ebert said. Then, Ebert said, the man asked the store owner questions about the nature of smokeless powder. ""That is a red flag for me,"" Ebert said. ""He should know. Why is he buying that much?"" Ebert said the man also picked up one magazine and shotgun shells, and then left in a cab. After discussing the matter at length with the owner, Ebert called police. The soldier also purchased uniforms with Fort Hood unit patches from a local military surplus store, Carter's office said, citing police. After Abdo's arrest, police searched his hotel room and backpack and found six pounds of smokeless powder, Christmas lights and battery-operated clocks -- which were apparently intended to create a timing and triggering device -- sugar, shrapnel, a pressure cooker, and shotgun shells that were being dismantled for raw explosives, a Defense Department official told CNN. The materials were enough to make two bombs, the official said. In the soldier's backpack, police also found ""Islamic extremist literature,"" a .40-caliber pistol and components that could be used in a bomb, a law enforcement official said. A statement on the Fort Hood website acknowledged Abdo's arrest but said it had no connection to the post. It said the private first class had been assigned to Company E of the 101st Airborne Division's 1st Brigade Combat Team. ""Since he is in the custody of civilian authorities, jurisdiction over any potential new charges is yet to be determined. If returned to military control, he may face additional charges including AWOL,"" the statement said. Fort Hood spokesman Chris Haug said officials have received no indication that Abdo tried to get onto Fort Hood between the time he went AWOL and the time of his arrest. Abdo, who joined the infantry in 2009, refused to deploy to Afghanistan on religious grounds. The Army approved his request to be discharged as a conscientious objector, but on May 13, he was charged with possession of child pornography on his computer, according to the statement. After a June 15 hearing, at which Abdo was recommended for court-martial, he went AWOL. In media interviews last year, Abdo said he felt compelled to remain true to his faith. ""We have two things that I believe make us American, and that's freedom of religion and freedom of choice,"" he said. When he signed up for the military, Abdo said he had not thought that his religious beliefs would be an issue. ""I was under the impression that I could serve both the U.S. Army and my God simultaneously,"" he said. But as his deployment neared, he began to rethink things and eventually worked up the courage to approach his unit and tell them how he felt, he said. ""Islam is a much more peaceful and tolerant religion than it is an aggressive religion,"" he said. ""I don't believe that Islam allows me to operate in any kind of warfare at all, including the U.S. military and any war it partakes in. I believe that our first duty as a Muslim is to serve God."" After Abdo's arrest, Texas Gov. Rick Perry issued a statement calling it ""a sobering reminder of the importance of remaining vigilant in the ongoing efforts to protect our communities from those that would do us harm."" Hasan, the prime suspect in the 2009 Fort Hood killings, could face the death penalty. His trial is set to begin March 5, 2012.

"In 2012, hard-nosed rhetoric from the United States and Israel has accompanied an ever louder drumbeat for a possible ""military option"" to combat Iran's nuclear program. Tehran has responded with threats and escalating rhetoric. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, on the 33rd anniversary of the Islamic Revolution (February 11), emphasized Iran's determination for nuclear development, promising to announce new breakthroughs in the near future. And Wednesday he watched as fuel rods were loaded into the core of a Tehran reactor. Is a military strike inevitable? U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta recently expressed his belief that Israel might strike within the next two to three months. Whether or not he knows for sure, one wonders why such statements were made public. Israel seems to suggest that unless decisive steps are taken to halt Iran's nuclear plans, the military option may be inevitable. Israel, it should be recalled, didn't threaten Iraq before it attacked its nuclear site in 1981; neither did Israel confirm striking the Syrian nuclear facilities in 2007. Iran has responded by threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz -- the key strategic waterway that is a conduit for more than a quarter of the world's oil -- so that not a drop of oil will pass through the strait. During the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), Iran often threatened to close the strait but never did, so why is Iran, which is economically dependent on oil exported through the Persian Gulf, again threatening to close the strait now? There seems to be a thick smoke screen, a tug of war and (rhetorical) arm-twisting aimed at domestic audiences no less than their international adversaries. To be sure, there are serious reasons for Western concern. The International Atomic Energy Association's November report suggesting Iran had resumed its clandestine nuclear military program has contributed to the current escalation. In fact, possession of nuclear weapons by a regime with Iran's radical ideology would dramatically change the geo-strategic map of the region and trigger nuclear proliferation throughout the Middle East. Nuclear Iran would also serve as an umbrella for Islamist movements, such as Hamas and Hezbollah, emboldening them and leading to greater radicalism throughout the region. The regional instability following the ""Arab Spring,"" Iran's involvement in Bahrain and Syria, and its meddling elsewhere (mainly in Iraq and Afghanistan) have made the Iranian challenge even more alarming. Moreover, while in the past Iran's national interest often balanced its radical ideology producing relative pragmatism, it now appears that Iran is primarily concerned with regime survival, which may trigger greater extremism. Imagine what might have happened if Moammar Gadhafi had nuclear weapons just a few months ago or if Iran's principal ally, Bashar al-Assad in Syria, had them now. U.S. allies in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, Israel) have persistently pressured the United States to confront Iran. Washington may be trying to reassure its allies and as well as dissuade them (mainly Israel) from taking independent action that could ultimately drag the U.S. into an open confrontation with Iran. The United States also recognizes that Iran is weak and vulnerable and can be pressured to reconsider its nuclear policy. Yet the Iranian nuclear program appears to be progressing, which is also creating a sense of urgency among the United States and its allies. This is also an election year -- the U.S. presidential election in the November and Iran's parliamentary elections in the spring. There may be elections in Israel as well. The pre-election posturing has also contributed to the tough rhetoric from all sides. In Israel, the recent rhetorical escalation undoubtedly reveals genuine concern. The Iranian calls to ""eliminate and destroy"" Israel and its denial of Holocaust, coupled with the Israeli mantra that Iran poses an ""existential threat,"" has shaped public opinion. One can question the wisdom of using the term ""existential threat,"" which sends the wrong message to Iran (that Israel is frightened) and to Israelis (suggesting that if Iran goes nuclear they should leave the country). Likewise, equating Iran with Nazi Germany and Ahmadinejad with Hitler only diminishes the historical significance of the Holocaust. Such comparisons may also create the impression that the Iranian nuclear program is mainly, if not exclusively, Israel's problem, which demands a solution with the trademark ""made in Israel."" Yet this is a convenient way to deliver the message at home as well as abroad. This approach also seems to have awakened Europe to the gravity and urgency of the threat of a nuclear Iran. For its part, the Islamic Revolution is marking its 33rd anniversary in a gloomy atmosphere, facing severe socioeconomic and political-factional challenges. It has been pummeled economically by the cumulative effects of the U.N. Security Council sanctions, and those imposed independently by the United States and European Union. Its currency has been devalued considerably, and growing unemployment and inflation are squeezing the people. Although the riots following the rigged 2009 presidential elections have been crushed, the fire of rebellion rages on. Clearly, the Islamic regime has lost much of its legitimacy among its own youth. Still, thus far, Tehran shows no sign of retreating from its nuclear schemes. In fact, for Iranian hard-liners, a threatening distant enemy is an advantage; it allows the regime to demonstrate power and rally the people, with the nuclear program as symbol of pride and independence. Still, there are ways to delay the Iranian nuclear program, short of the hazardous military option. In contrast to the regime's inflated pretensions, Iran today is weak and vulnerable. A unified, uncompromising Western policy may still force Iran to rethink its nuclear policy, even without Russia and China on board. If states of the West put their individual short-term economic interests aside, they would be able to face collectively what seems to be the major geo-strategic challenge of 2012. Finally, while the ""military option"" is already ""off of the shelf"" and in play, all parties (with the exception of some radicals, mainly in Iran) are aware of its severe ramifications. Continued rhetoric may lead to further escalation and miscalculation, which may deteriorate to confrontation even if none of the parties actually want it -- the 1967 war in the Middle East is only one such example. Leaders may find themselves trapped in a rhetorical corner with their countries dragged into an unintended confrontation.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Monday called the death of Neda Agha-Soltan ""suspicious"" and urged the country's authorities to identify those responsible for it, Iran's semi-official Fars news agency reported Monday. Neda Agha-Soltan has come to symbolize Iranian resistance to official election results. The 26-year-old's death has come to symbolize Iranian resistance to the government's official election results since it was captured on amateur video. Within hours of its being posted online June 20, she had become the iconic victim of the Iranian government crackdown. But Iran has been pushing back against eyewitness reports that she was shot by pro-government Basij militiamen perched on a rooftop near a demonstration. Ahmadinejad told the head of Iran's judiciary, Ayatollah Hashemi Shahroudi, to probe the incident and make the results of his investigations public, Fars reported Monday, nine days after Agha-Soltan was killed.  See gallery of Neda and the effect of her life » . ""The massive propaganda of the foreign media, as well as other evidence, proves the interference of the enemies of the Iranian nation who want to take political advantage and darken the pure face of the Islamic republic,"" he said in a letter to Shahroudi, according to the news agency. The letter comes a day after Iran's government-backed Press TV said Agha-Soltan did not die the way the opposition claims. Two people told Press TV there were no security forces in the area when she was killed. iReport.com: Iranians share view from the streets . And the network said the type of bullet that killed her is not used by Iranian security forces. A man who told the network that he had helped take her to a hospital said, ""There were no security forces or any member of the Basij"" paramilitary present when she was killed. Press TV did not name the man, who spoke Farsi and was subtitled in English on the broadcast. CNN has not identified him and cannot confirm his account. ""I didn't see who shot who,"" he said. ""The whole scene looked suspicious to me."" A second man, whom Press TV identified as Agha-Soltan's music teacher, told the station there were ""no security forces in this street"" when he was with her during the shooting. Press TV did not name the man, who had a gray mustache and ponytail. He also spoke Farsi and was subtitled in English as he walked and pointed at what Press TV said was the scene of the shooting in central  Tehran. Agha-Soltan was with a family friend who is a music teacher when she was killed. He appears to be the man who spoke to Press TV. ""There was no sign of a protest,"" he said. ""We crossed the street to the other side to get a cab. ... When we reached this spot, a gunshot was heard. There was no shooting here. ... There were no security forces in this street. There were around 20, 30 people in this street. One shot was heard, and that bullet hit Neda."" ""The bullet was apparently fired from a small-caliber pistol that's not used by Iranian security forces,"" the Press TV anchor said. Iran has strict gun-control laws that bar private citizens from carrying firearms. U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday that he had seen the video of Agha-Soltan's death and called it ""heartbreaking."" ""And I think anyone who sees it knows there's something fundamentally unjust about it,"" he said. The shaky video of her death -- probably made on a cell phone -- shows her walking with a man near an anti-government demonstration. After being stuck in traffic for more than an hour inside a subcompact car with a poorly working air conditioner, Agha-Soltan and the friend decided to get out of the car for some fresh air, a friend of Agha-Soltan's told CNN after her death. The two were near where protesters were chanting in opposition to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Agha-Soltan, wearing a baseball cap over a black scarf, a black shirt, blue jeans and tennis shoes, did not appear to be chanting and seemed to be observing the demonstration. Suddenly, Agha-Soltan was on the ground -- felled by a gunshot wound to the chest. Several men knelt by her side and put pressure on her chest in an attempt to stop the bleeding. ""She has been shot! Someone, come and take her!"" shouted one man. By then, Agha-Soltan's eyes had rolled to her right; her body was limp. Blood streamed from her mouth, then from her nose. For a second, her face was hidden from view as the camera went behind one of the men. When Agha-Soltan's face came back into view, it was covered with blood. Iran's ambassador to Mexico -- one of few Iranian officials who has spoken to CNN since the disputed June 12 presidential election -- suggested that U.S. intelligence services could be responsible for her death. ""This death of Neda is very suspicious,"" Ambassador Mohammad Hassan Ghadiri said. ""My question is, how is it that this Miss Neda is shot from behind, got shot in front of several cameras, and is shot in an area where no significant demonstration was behind held? ""Well, if the CIA wants to kill some people and attribute that to the government elements, then choosing women is an appropriate choice, because the death of a woman draws more sympathy,"" Ghadiri said. CIA spokesman George Little responded, ""Any suggestion that the CIA was responsible for the death of this young woman is wrong, absurd and offensive.""","Mahmoud Ahmadinejad call's Neda's death ""suspicious""

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. counterterrorism officials are investigating possible links between the attempted Northwest Airlines bombing and two former Guantanamo Bay prisoners who say they are leaders in an al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group based in Yemen, U.S. officials told CNN on Tuesday. The organization, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, has claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing, and the alleged bomber, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, was in Yemen this month. The two self-proclaimed leaders of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula were released from the U.S. detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in 2007 and sent to Saudi Arabia, according to a Department of Defense report on former detainees at Guantanamo who have returned to terrorism activities. The unclassified version of the Defense Intelligence Agency report was released publicly last April and highlights former detainees who have carried out or are suspected of having carried out terrorist attacks after being released from the prison. According to the report, Abu Sufyan al-Shihri was released from Guantanamo in November 2007 and sent to Saudi Arabia; Mazin Salih Musaid al-Alawi al-Awfi was released in July 2007 and sent to Saudi Arabia. The report says the two men released a video last January announcing their leadership in the new organization, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. That announcement led to questions about how many other former Guantanamo detainees may be planning to carry out terrorist attacks. Pentagon officials have not released updated statistics on recidivism, but the unclassified report from April says 74 individuals, or 14 percent of former detainees, have turned to or are suspected of having turned to terrorism activity since their release. The data represent the most recent publicly available statistics on former detainees tracked by military and other U.S. government intelligence agencies. Of the more than 530 detainees released from the prison between 2002 and last spring, 27 were confirmed to have engaged in terrorist activities and 47 were suspected of participating in a terrorist act, according to Pentagon statistics cited in the spring report. Since the report's release, the total number of released detainees has risen to about 560, Pentagon officials said. Pentagon statistics indicate that there was a slight increase in the release of detainees from Guantanamo at the end of 2008, and the number of released detainees turning to or suspected of turning to the insurgency is almost double, from 7 percent a few years ago, Pentagon officials familiar with the information told CNN. The report said that between December 2008 and March 2009, nine former detainees were added to the confirmed list; six of them had been on the suspected list. The Pentagon categorizes as ""suspected"" any former Guantanamo detainee about whom significant reporting indicates involvement in terrorist activities. The report categorizes as ""confirmed"" any former detainee identified as involved in terrorist activity by a preponderance of evidence -- such as fingerprints, DNA, photo match or reliable or well-corroborated intelligence. ""What's clear is we are not seeing recidivism on the decline,"" said a defense official who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman declined to say what officials think is the reason for the increase, but said the United States monitors released detainees as well as it can. The Pentagon's report on recidivism identified almost 30 former detainees confirmed or suspected to have gone on to fight, including al-Shihri and al-Awfi, and includes examples of what these men did after their release. The report also cited others: . • Abdullah Saleh Ali al-Ajmi, who was released in 2005 to Kuwait. In April 2008, he blew himself up in Mosul, Iraq, killing a number of Iraqis. • Mohammed Ismail was released from the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay in early 2004 and returned to Afghanistan to be set free. Within four months, the U.S. military said, he was recaptured in Afghanistan attacking U.S. troops there, with paperwork that said he was a Taliban member in good standing. • Abdullah Gulam Rasoul, who was released from Guantanamo in December 2007 and set free in Afghanistan, has become a powerful Taliban military commander in southern Afghanistan, and the United States suspects he is responsible for several attacks on U.S. forces there, the military said. A senior U.S. military official last May said he believes Rasoul is using his Guantanamo experience to build on his ""rock star status"" among the Taliban. The U.S. military had no updated information on the status of Rasoul for this story. The Pentagon report also cited men sent home to Morocco who were later captured and accused of recruiting people for al Qaeda in Iraq; two men freed in Saudi Arabia who became leaders in a new al Qaeda organization there; and a Russian sent home who later was arrested for playing a role in a gas line bombing.","Two ex-prisoners say they're leaders in an al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group based in Yemen .

"The rollout of the federal Obamacare website has been a disaster, full stop. There can be no excuses, nor will I be making any. It's been clear for years what needed to be done, and failing was not an option. The exchanges, and the website that allowed access to them, had to work, and they just do not. I wrote a week or two ago that the initial problems with the HealthCare.gov  website appeared to be because of volume issues. That could be spun as either a positive or negative thing. But it now seems that the surge was not the cause of the malfunctions. After the first weekend, when the administration added additional capacity to the servers, the issues didn't go away. What are they? I wish I could say for sure. But some good reports have come out that detail just a few of the problems. Have you had trouble signing up? Tell us your experience . The first appears to be that the administration decided that people would need to provide a significant amount of personal detail to look at coverage options. I can attest to this first-hand. I have insurance through my work, so I don't need exchange coverage, but I was still interested in looking at what was available. I had to provide a lot of information, about my job and family, before I could do so. It's possible that this was because administrators wanted to be able to provide subsidy information to people with the premium costs, so as to soften the blow of how expensive insurance could be, but no one knows for sure. Regardless, this complicated things significantly. But that's just the front end. The back end is also a real problem. Insurance companies are reporting that the data they are receiving from the HealthCare.gov website is garbled. This means that automatic processing of the insurance plans being ordered is impossible. Oddly enough, the problems on the front end are actually helping here. So few orders are actually making it through that insurance companies are able to sort through the bad data by hand to complete enrollment. But if things improve on the front end, then there's no way these companies can do millions of applications without good data. The administration is bragging that upwards of half a million applications have started. Shockingly few of them have been completed, though. The front end has a number of steps, including submitting your information, assessing for eligibility and then shopping for insurance. The number being cited by the administration refers only to people who have completed the first step. There are people who believe that government can never do things as well as the private sector. I'm not one of those people. But in this specific instance, those people have a point. Evidently, those in charge of the rollout of the exchange website were unprepared. They didn't have the necessary experience to manage the more than 50 different contractors producing software independently that would eventually need to function together as a whole. This is incredibly technical work, and it's not clear that government was in a good position to direct things here. It appears that the Obama administration has learned its lesson. Administration officials are now calling in ""more computer experts"" to try and fix the problem. But this may be too little, too late. Some are saying that even if the administration pours in massive resources, the problems may not be fixed by December 15, the deadline for when insurance needs to be bought for it to be covering people on January 1. Even if the administration can get this done within a month, some in the insurance industry are concerned that these issues may act as a filter to dissuade healthy people from getting insurance. If it's really, really hard to complete an application, then only truly ill people may have the perseverance to do so. That could lead to problems in the pool of people signing up for insurance. The administration needs healthy people to buy insurance, too, for the exchanges to function optimally . If we were talking about a company having mismanaged things so badly, you could be sure that heads would roll. Many would be fired, and there would be a change in management. But that may not be possible here. Were Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to go,  President Barack Obama couldn't get someone else vetted and through the Senate nomination process in an expedient manner. He's likely stuck with his current team, or no team at all. That doesn't mean Obamacare will fail. It's still possible that this could all be fixed. It's also possible that should significant issues continue, timelines might be adjusted to accommodate implementation issues. But these will cause problems political and real in nature. Continued failures in the exchange rollout give the President's opponents fuel to attack him and his health care reform. More importantly, they prevent people who really do need insurance, and the care it allows, from getting what they need.","Aaron Carroll: Obamacare rollout has been a disaster; there's no excuse for it .

"(CNN) -- The steady hum of sewing machines fills the air inside a large glovemaking factory on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, the bustling Ethiopian capital. Patches of leather move through an array of working stations as busy laborers work feverishly to meet the company's export quota: 5,000 gloves a day. The operation belongs to Pittards, a UK-based company whose trading partnership with Ethiopia dates back to the early 1900s. Here, hardy, durable cow hide is made into work gloves. These are ideal for builders and gardeners, and are mainly exported to the U.S. And then there are the stylish designs -- created from a different type of animal skin, these are made to keep fingers warm in Tokyo, Paris and Rome. ""The fashion glove is made of sheep skin which is unique to Ethiopia,"" explains Tsedenia Mekbib, general manager at Pittards Products Manufacturing. ""The durability, the stretch ability and the strength makes it popular for gloving leather specifically. That has been the one strength of Ethiopia and the leather sector."" Sophisticated designs with decorative touches may be the hallmark of this type of glove, but they must also be practical. Ethiopia's climate makes this animal skin effective at withstanding the winter chill -- an essential selling point. And this effective material is in abundant supply. Ethiopia's 90-million cattle, sheep and goat population is one of the world's largest, according to the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. Creative process . What slips onto the customer's hand may be elegant, but the process to create the glove certainly is not. It all starts in the tannery where workers -- dressed in aprons and thick, elbow-high protective gloves -- convert the raw animal hides and skins into finished leather through a number of processes. Some of the steps include soaking the skin and fleshing it to remove any unwanted parts. A retanning process where the leather is colored is followed by a stage under a special vacuum dryer where the skin is dried and then stretched to increase its surface area. Once all this has happened, another machine softens the leather to make it flexible -- an important feature of gloves. The end product, ready for export, is pure sheep skin prepared to be turned into gloves -- labeled with the thickness and the area it covers. Export ban . In a move to encourage value addition and increase revenues generated by the leather sector, the Ethiopian government banned all exports of raw hides and skins in 1989. Between 2006 and 2012, the total value of Ethiopia's exports of leather and leather products grew from $66 million to $112 million. And it's not just Pittards that have realized the opportunity to make gloves in Ethiopia. According to the Leather Industry Development Institute, two other factories in the country are focused on creating the hand garments. Shoes is another major area which uses Ethiopian leather. The country is home to dozens of shoemaking companies, including local names such as Oliberte and international players like the Huajian Group, a Chinese company that has been exporting some 20,000 pairs of shoes a month since it launched its manufacturing facility outside Addis Ababa in 2012. Business conditions . Despite a major focus to rapidly build its energy and transport infrastructure, Ethiopia is still struggling to provide the best conditions for businesses setting up shop in the country. ""The challenges that we encountered when we started business are from power cuts to logistics to foreign currency availability, to lead time in having available raw materials,"" explains Mekbib. ""Having the solutions to these challenges would allow us to be competitive as a country and as a company as a whole."" Beyond these issues, international manufactures also struggle to recruit workers. Ethiopia's population is growing at a rate of 2.89%, placing it among the top 15 fastest growing populations in the world, according to the CIA Factbook. But a large workforce and a skilled work force is not the same thing. In fact, Mekbib says ""bridging the gap between the rest of the world and the skills set in Ethiopia on the ground has been the greatest challenge so far."" Another growth area, is the number of Ethiopians entering the middle class and showing a desire to buy high quality clothes. In a report published this month, the IMF said the country is on track to achieve its goal of reaching middle income status by 2025. The trend is so clear to Pittards that they are now targeting consumers inside the country. But for Ethiopians, it's not just the top quality of the leather products that makes them take out their wallets, it's also access to a label they can call their own: made in Ethiopia.

"(CNN) -- As the country was sinking into its worst financial crisis in more than 70 years, Security and Exchange Commission employees and contractors cruised porn sites and viewed sexually explicit pictures using government computers, according to an agency report obtained by CNN. ""During the past five years, the SEC OIG (Office of Inspector General) substantiated that 33 SEC employees and or contractors violated Commission rules and policies, as well as the government-wide Standards of Ethical Conduct, by viewing pornographic, sexually explicit or sexually suggestive images using government computer resources and official time,"" said a summary of the investigation by the inspector general's office. More than half of the workers made between $99,000 and $223,000. All the cases took place over the past five years. ""It is nothing short of disturbing that high-ranking officials within the SEC were spending more time looking at pornography than taking action to help stave off the events that brought our nation's economy to the brink of collapse,"" said Rep. Darrell Issa. The Republican is the ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. ""This stunning report should make everyone question the wisdom of moving forward with plans to give regulators like the SEC even more widespread authority,"" he said. ""Inexplicably, rather than exercise its existing regulatory enforcement authority, SEC officials were preoccupied with other distractions."" SEC spokesman John Nester said the employees involved have been disciplined or are being disciplined. Some have been suspended or dismissed, he said, adding that the SEC has further increased penalties for misusing government resources in recent months. ""We will not tolerate the transgressions of the very few who bring discredit to their thousands of hardworking colleagues,"" he said. The investigation came to light on the same day President Obama gave a speech in lower Manhattan, calling for reform in the finance industry. On Capitol Hill, the Senate is working on a financial reform bill that would set up regulatory oversight of the financial industry's practices with the goal of preventing another Wall Street meltdown like the one in 2008 that launched the U.S. recession. The bill includes an ""early warning"" system intended to spot signs of crisis, as well as a $50 billion liquidation fund created with money from banks and other finance industry corporations to ensure an orderly transition in closing down failing entities. It was recently approved by the Senate's Banking and Agricultural committees. The House passed its version of the bill in December. The inspector general's report includes specific examples of misuse by employees. A regional office staff accountant tried to access pornographic websites nearly 1,800 times, using her SEC laptop during a two-week period.

"The Chinese government is sponsoring cyber-espionage to attack top U.S. companies, according to Grady Summers, vice president of security firm Mandiant. Virginia-based Mandiant published a 60-page report detailing allegations over a six-year period against a group of hackers -- known as Comment Crew -- which Summers linked to a secret division of the Chinese military. Summers told CNN: ""China is attacking the U.S. on a scale like we've never seen before... We believe that the Communist Party of China is very aware of this."" Read more: Have the courage to deal with cyber war . Mandiant says the activity can be traced to four networks near Shanghai -- with some operations taking place in a location that is also the headquarters of Unit 61398, the secret military division. Summers added: ""Never before have we seen one state-sponsored entity like unit 61398 of the Chinese PLA attacking helpless commercial organizations in other countries."" Read more: Chinese cyber attacks on West are widespread, experts say . The espionage group mainly targeted U.S. blue chip companies in 20 separate industries from aerospace to financial services. ""It's really a who's who of American companies. Of 140 victims worldwide, 115 of them were in the U.S.,"" Grady said. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei dismissed the hacking charges on Tuesday, insisting that China is the victim of many cyberattacks -- most originating in the United States. ""Making baseless accusations based on premature analysis is irresponsible and unprofessional,"" he said. ""China resolutely opposes any form of hacking activities."" Earlier this month, President Obama signed an executive order designed to address the country's most basic cybersecurity needs -- and highlighted the effort in his State of the Union address. Summers says a cyber offence by the U.S. is not an appropriate response to the attacks as ""it creates more problems than it solves."" Instead, he advocates better defense systems in organizations that are vulnerable to cyber attacks and diplomatic pressure from Washington on Beijing. The Mandiant report details 3,000 technical indicators including IP addresses, domain names and encryption certificates, that can be used to strengthen companies' defenses.","Mandiant say thousands of cyber attacks have come from one neighborhood near Shanghai .

"Thousands of Chinese and South Korean students applying for colleges and universities in the United States face an anxious wait amid claims of widespread cheating during recent SAT tests -- the measure used in the admissions process. Their scores have been delayed pending an inquiry, despite the deadline for college applications fast approaching. ""Based on specific, reliable information, we have placed the scores of all students who are current residents of (South) Korea or China and sat for the October 11 international administration of the SAT on hold while we conduct an administrative review,"" Tom Ewing, spokesperson for test assessors the Educational Testing Service (ETS), said in a statement. ""(We) strongly denounce organizations that seek to illegally obtain test materials for their own profit,"" added Ewing. In recent years, China in particular has experienced a surge in the number of students applying to U.S.-based colleges and universities. But fierce competition in China has led to a culture of cheating, according to Beijing-based educational consultant and teacher Jiang Xuequin. ""Chinese people see education as a game to be beaten,"" he told CNN. ""If you can beat it, you're a good player. If you can't beat it, then you're just stupid. Cheating is seen as a fair way to play the game. ""There's absolutely no sense of shame in cheating... it's been going on for years."" Electronic cheating . Just days ago, 2,440 Chinese students taking a national exam were caught using high-tech cheating gear, from wireless earpieces to ""electronic erasers."" But the problem isn't unique to China. South Korea, another country with large numbers of students studying in the United States, has been hit cheating as well, with unscrupulous tactics often blamed on intense cramming schools called ""Hakwons."" Last May, College Board, which runs the SAT system, canceled an SAT testing date in South Korea after tutor companies were suspected to have illegally acquired SAT testing materials in advance and told their students what would be on the test.","Chinese and South Korean who took SAT on October 11 will have scores delayed .

"The last time a new PlayStation or Xbox hit the market, Facebook had fewer than 12 million users, a tablet was a pill and nobody outside of Apple had heard of a gadget called the iPhone. That was more than seven years ago. It's a vastly different technology landscape that will greet Sony and Microsoft in the coming days when the two old rivals go head to head again with splashy new consoles. Sony's PlayStation 4 hits stores on Friday, with Microsoft's Xbox One coming a week later, on November 22. Between them, they account for two of the gaming world's Big Three (Nintendo, which rolled out the Wii U last year, casts a wider net to draw children, families and more casual players). The venerable PlayStation and Xbox remain the fiercest rivals for the hearts and minds of so-called hardcore gamers -- the diehards who stand in line for intense, intricate titles like ""Call of Duty"" that pull in more cash than Hollywood blockbusters. But it was 2005 when the Xbox 360 hit the market, and a year later when the PlayStation 3 debuted. Now, the two platforms will be competing for holiday dollars in a world where anyone can boot up a video game instantly on a phone or tablet, and in which streaming and cloud technology mean most major video-game titles can be played as easily on souped-up PCs. Even the now-ubiquitous Facebook, which now has 1.1 billion users, plays a role. Tens of millions of people play games on the site daily (athough few of the faithful who will line up for the new consoles may consider crushing candy or farming virtual cows ""real"" gaming). So which of the two rivals, if either, will cut through the clutter and prevail? It remains to be seen, though the fight has already begun. Earlier this year, Microsoft reversed course on poorly received plans to require Xbox One users to be online while playing and to limit how much digital games could be shared or resold. But that wasn't before Sony got in some shots of its own. Early reviews of the PS4 have been positive, with Time.com's Matt Peckham praising it as ""everything Sony's learned about platform design, honed and polished to something just shy of perfection."" The Xbox One will get its chance to shine next week. And the debate over which platform is better will continue, long after the new consoles start landing in homes.

"(CNN) -- If our children's children should die from Ebola here in the United States, President Obama would be to blame. That is a sentiment I found in numerous comments on Ebola articles that I came across on the Internet. After a while I stopped reading, convinced that if President Obama found a cure for cancer, these would be the people who would blame him for putting doctors out of work. That was before Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican and a member of the Homeland Security Committee rumored to have 2016 aspirations, stepped up on Friday and said, ""Unfortunately this is another example where the administration was not as engaged early on as they should have been and now we're playing catch-up."" Then Sunday, Reince Priebus, head of the Republican National Committee, said, ""People today don't feel better off than they were five years ago, and obviously whether it's the GSA, the IRS, Syria, Ebola, the Secret Service, I mean what's going well in regard to this administration and those senators who have followed this president lockstep?"" That's when it was clear: A lot of President Obama's critics are blaming him for Ebola. I guess if some religious conservatives can blame Hurricane Sandy on gay marriage then certainly there is room to lay blame for the outbreak of Ebola on the steps of the White House. Especially if you're comfortable with ignoring reality and rejecting facts. Opinion: Get proactive about screening for Ebola . How can President Obama's response be characterized as negligent when his administration began directing resourcesâ€”including more than $21 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development -- to areas hit with the virus within days of the first Ebola diagnosis? That was in March. On April 1, according to the World Health Organization, the spread was ""relatively small still."" Since then, the Obama administration has committed an additional $175 million and sent 3,000 troops to West Africa to combat the crisis. This comes on top of the largest international response in the history of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When you look at the timeline, it would appear the Obama administration has been leading the fight against the spread of the disease since last winter. And yet, what does Rush Limbaugh have to say? ""It's being treated and dealt with in the most irresponsible, incompetent manner I can think of."" Opinion: Protecting against Ebola trumps liberty . Which is either a confession that Limbaugh is having trouble thinking or just another example of a Republican mouthpiece refusing to let reality get in the way of a good narrative, especially when we're so close to the midterm election. Limbaugh's proclamation is particularly outrageous considering he lived through the AIDS epidemic in the United States. For those who don't remember that timelineâ€”which obviously includes Rush--the first cases were discovered in 1981. By February 1984, the CDC stated there were more than 4,100 cases in the United States and nearly 2,000 people had already died. President Reagan didn't publicly address the disease until May 1987. By then more than 20,000 Americans had died and the virus had spread to more than 100 countries. I would think in the lexicon of irresponsible and incompetent manners to address a public health crisis, Reagan comes out on top. The Reagan administration's response to AIDS was not only painfully slow, then-Press Secretary Larry Speakes even made jokes about people dying. Compared to the way Reagan handled AIDS, Obama's response to Ebola should be praised. When he went to the United Nations in September, he told world leaders, ""We are not moving fast enough."" This is a month after WHO declared the Ebola outbreak a public health emergency and before the diagnosis of an infected man in Dallas. Opinion: Ebola quarantine is perfectly legal . With Democrats in the Senate against the ropes, giddy Republicans hoping for a red November cannot be bothered with facts no matter how egregious their rhetoric to the contrary may be. So, GOP party leaders and promoters go out and proclaim President Obama, the man whose signature piece of legislation is designed to provide preventive care, is doing little to prevent the spread of a deadly disease, and hope voters buy it. I guess when you have people hating President Obama they'll believe just about anything bad said about him, even if it's ridiculous. Case in point: At a summer fundraiser for former GOP Rep. Allen West of Florida, an attendee said, ""I personally believe that Obama is a Muslim ... and I believe that he is doing everything in his power to bring this country down."" West seized the opportunity to fan those flames by first insinuating that Obama said as much, followed by, ""The President has an Eastern orientation"" using his own affinity for SEC football to support his claim against Obama. I felt a little dumber after watching the exchange, and yet no one in the audience seemed to mind. All of which explains why some Republicans are now out blaming Obama for Ebola. It may not be true, but it's still great for business.","LZ Granderson: A lot of President Obama's critics are blaming him for Ebola .

"Fossil fuels are going to run out. This much we know. No one is entirely certain when they will run out exactly, but we know it will happen eventually. Some estimates suggest we have about 70 years of coal, gas and oil left; the fossil fuel industry itself insists that we have significantly longer. But everyone agrees they will run out in due course. So how will the world be powered when we can't rely anymore on fossil fuels? Why with volcanoes, waves, wet wood and solar power from space. To compensate for the decline of traditional energy sources, researchers around the world are developing innovative new technologies that -- between them -- may provide a long-term solution to our rapidly growing energy needs. Some are familiar, some may seem far-fetched, and some could potentially pose as much of a threat to the environment as fossil fuels themselves. CNN takes a look through some of the more interesting and unusual energy technologies currently under development. Solar energy from space . The idea of collecting solar power from space has been under consideration since the 1970s. Putting solar panels into orbit offers a few obvious advantages over regular solar power such as not having to deal with atmospheric interventions (cloud cover and atmospheric gasses) and not losing any productivity at night. In the past, trying to get a power plant to the edge of the Earth's atmosphere seemed deeply unlikely. But John Mankins, a former NASA engineer now with the Artemis Group has been working on a project that he believes will make such an audacious idea simple: . ""The basic concept of the Solar Power Satellite (SPS) is to deploy a large platform in space near Earth,"" Makins says, ""typically in a high orbit where the sun shines almost constantly, where it would harvest sunlight, convert it into electricity and then transmit it to receivers on Earth for use."" Read more: Can Africa unlock its solar potential? Some have suggested that lasers could be used to transmit the energy from space. Mankins says that in his view this is possible, but potentially dangerous (""think about the Death Star"" he said ominously in an interview with Motherboard). Instead his project aims to use low-intensity microwave transmitters, which he believes will be safer. Mankins says that the energy yield from a solar power satellite could be significant, potentially delivering up to 1,000-2,000 MW of power to the Earth. To put it into perspective, he says ""a typical home in the U.S. requires about 4-5 kW of power, or about 100 kW-hours per day, or about 3,000 kW-hours per month, or about 36,000 kW-hours per year. So a single SPS ... would -- for example - deliver power / energy for roughly 240,000-480,000 homes."" Some critics say the project would be prohibitively expensive or that getting something so large into space presents challenges. Others note that the energy yield is still not high enough to make the project worthwhile. Still, the fact that it is being considered by NASA lends it significant weight. So perhaps it is not so out of this world after all. Mining volcanoes for power . Last year, work began on a new plan to extract heat from the hot rocks that lie under and around volcanoes. By injecting water into cracks in the ground, researchers hope that they may be able to create steam to power subterranean electricity turbines. Two companies, AltaRock Energy and Davenport Newberry, were granted permission to test this procedure in the land around the Newberry Volcano in Oregon, in a process that critics argue is not dissimilar to the controversial technique of hydraulic fracturing. Read more: Nuclear fusion is the 'perfect energy source' Over the past 12 months hydraulic fracturing or fracking has been the subject of protests around the world, but in fact it has been around since the 1960s. The CEO of AltaRock, Susan Petty, said in a company blog post that ""creating multiple reservoirs from a single injection multiplies the amount of energy that can be extracted from each production well,"" and will ""extend the life of the well and increase the energy recovery from each well, significantly improving the economics of enhanced geothermal system power generation."" But fracking is known to potentially generate earthquakes, and -- as noted by Wired magazine -- practicing a similar technique beneath a volcano that the U.S. Geological Survey says ""is certain to erupt again"" seems an odd choice. Whether the technique can yield significant energy return, and be conducted safely is still a matter of debate as heated as the Newberry volcano itself. Wave energy . Wave energy is already being used across the world. Billions of dollars have been invested in the technology and the world's first ""wave farm"" opened near Porto in Portugal in 2008. At the European Marine Energy Center in Orkney, Scotland, the world's biggest wave farm was approved for construction earlier this year. The 40MW farm off the north-west coast of Lewis promises to deliver enough energy to power nearly 30,000 homes. Wave farms deploy massive buoys to turn the motion of waves into power. Aquamarine Power the company running the project in Orkney, says that its huge yellow buoys have ""a maximum generating capacity of 800kW."" The bright yellow machines measures 26 meters across and are installed at a depth of around 13 meters, around 500 meters from the shore. The advantages of wave power are similar to those of wind -- the waves are free -- but there are some additional benefits. In particular, it's easier to forecast wave energy output, because waves are driven by wind, but don't vary as rapidly; they build up more slowly and dissipate more gradually. That makes the energy from waves more predictable than that from wind or solar, which means that it is easier to integrate into the power grid. At present the UK is the world leader in the technology, with the U.S., Portugal and France also significant players. Pocket particle accelerators . Researchers working in a laboratory in Daresbury, UK believe that their pint-sized particle accelerator -- like the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland but much smaller -- could offer a genuine alternative to fossil fuels. Powered by thorium, a naturally occurring radioactive substance, the small scale collider could generate significant amounts of energy. The Mail on Sunday estimates that just one ton of thorium could ""produce as much energy as 200 tons of uranium, or 3.5 million tons of coal."" ""The idea of thorium reactors is one that is under a lot of discussion these days; clearly the physics will work,"" says Mankins. But he notes that there are always hazards in using nuclear material. ""Even though it certainly would be safer than past nuclear reactor approaches, it seems likely to me that governments are not going to want a lot of radioactive material on the highways."" Wet leaves and damp wood . Biomass power involves the breakdown of biological material -- such as leaves and wood -- to produce gasses like hydrogen and methane, which in turn can be burned. The problem with some existing biomass power plants is that they need the biological materials to be dry. Jens Dall Bentzen, a Danish inventor, has come up with a new type of biomass furnace that can trap moisture from damp materials and export it as hot water. Dall Benson believes this could allow his new furnace to generate up to 30% more energy. Read more: Solar power when the sun has set . ""What's unique about biomass,"" says Dall Bentzen, "" is that you can store it. You never really know when the wind is blowing. With biomass we have the control to use it when we need it."" ""Wind is the resource we have most of in Denmark,"" Danish Climate and Energy Minister Martin Lindegaard told CNN, ""and we need biomass and biogas to have the back up for when the wind stops blowing."" Critics argue that burning biomass contributes carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, but its proponents suggest that such damage can be offset by growing crops specifically to be burned. A viable alternative? One of the most substantial indicators of the viability of alternative energies can be seen in the growth in investment from venture capitalists and other private investors. William McDowall, from the University College London Energy Institute, notes that venture capital investments in clean energy went from less than $100 million a year in the late 1990s to over $10 billion a year in 2011. ""In the year 2000, most alternative energy technologies were considered niche options that might one day show promise -- now they're multi-billion dollar industries, significant enough to precipitate serious trade disputes between the US, EU and China,"" McDowall says. Government investment has shown a similar pattern, but significant public and private sector research money is still going into fossil fuels. New extraction and processing technologies for coal, oil and gas are still the main focus of private sector research and development. However many experts, McDowall included, believe that this may change by 2025 when alternative energies could finally stop being regarded as ""alternative.""","Researchers are looking for alternatives to fossil fuels .

"President Barack Obama said Wednesday that the world set a red line against chemical weapons use that he now seeks to apply to Syria, while a Senate committee approved a resolution authorizing the U.S. military attack that he is planning. By a 10-7 vote, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed the resolution that authorizes a limited military response, giving Obama an initial victory in his push to win congressional approval. The measure now goes to the full Senate for debate next week. The Democratic-led chamber is expected to pass it, but the outcome is less clear in the Republican-led House where top diplomatic and military officials made their case on Wednesday for action. Liberal Democrats, tea party libertarians and moderates from both sides questioned Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey about whether limited military attacks can change anything and if they will lead to U.S. involvement in another war. ""What are the chances of escalation? Are different scenarios accounted for? If our credibility is on the line now as is argued what about if Assad retaliates?"" asked GOP Rep. Ed Royce of California, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In Sweden on the first of a three-day overseas trip that includes the G-20 summit in Russia, Obama told reporters that the red line he spoke of last year regarding Syria's use of chemical weapons came from international treaties and past congressional action, rather than something he ""made up."" Obama also insisted he had the authority to order attacks -- expected to be cruise missile strikes on Syrian military command targets -- even if Congress rejects his request for authorization. America ""recognizes that if the international community fails to maintain certain norms, standards, laws, governing how countries interact and how people are treated, that over time this world becomes less safe,"" Obama said. ""It becomes more dangerous not only for those people who are subjected to these horrible crimes, but to all of humanity."" He cited World War II as an example, saying ""the people of Europe are certainly familiar with what happens when the international community finds excuses not to act."" At the same time, ""as commander in chief, I always preserve the right and the responsibility to act on behalf of America's national security,"" Obama said. Conservative critics have said Obama painted himself into a corner with his statement last year that Syria's use of chemical weapons was a red line that would change his approach to its civil war. Obama: It is the world's red line . ""A red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized,"" Obama said in August 2012. ""That would change my calculus."" Now, critics on the right say, he must respond to an alleged chemical weapons attack outside Damascus by the Syrian regime that Kerry said killed more than 1,400 people or lose credibility. The administration and top congressional leaders attempted to blunt that criticism on Tuesday during debate on Capitol Hill. Even House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, the chamber's No. 2 Republican, said any president would have drawn that red line based on international norms. Obama made that same argument on Wednesday, saying: ""I didn't set a red line. The world set a red line."" ""The world set a red line when governments representing 98 percent of the world's population said the use of chemical weapons are abhorrent and passed a treaty forbidding their use, even when countries are engaged in war,"" he said at a joint news conference with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt on the first day of a four-day trip that includes the G-20 summit in Russia. ""Congress set a red line when it ratified that treaty,"" Obama continued. ""Congress set a red line when it indicated that in a piece of legislation entitled the 'Syria Accountability Act' that some of the horrendous things that are happening on the ground there need to be answered for."" Sounding exasperated, Obama added: ""That wasn't something I just kind of made up. I didn't pluck it out of thin air. There's a reason for it."" Obama prods international community to act . Asked about whether he was seeking to save face, Obama insisted that ""my credibility is not on the line -- the international community's credibility is on the line."" He framed the question for the United Nations and the global community at large as: ""Are we going to try to find a reason not to act? And if that's the case, then I think the (world) community should admit it."" Opposition by Russia, a Syrian ally, has scuttled U.S. and British efforts to get the U.N. Security Council to authorize a military response against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime. U.N. inspectors returned from Syria last week from their mission to confirm if chemical weapons were used, but Kerry said Wednesday it would take three weeks for samples collected to analyzed and results announced. ""I respect the U.N. process,"" Obama said while standing next to Reinfeldt, who opposes military intervention without U.N. approval. ""We agree that the international community cannot be silent,"" Obama added, saying also that the U.N. investigators had done ""heroic work."" Noting the U.N. team's mandate was only to determine the use of chemical weapons, and not identify who used them, Obama repeated past statements that U.S. intelligence has confirmed chemical weapons use beyond any reasonable doubt and has further confirmed that al-Assad's regime ""was the source."" ""I do think that we have to act, because if we don't, we are effectively saying that even though we may condemn it and issue resolutions and so forth and so on, somebody who is not shamed by resolutions can continue to act with impunity,"" Obama said. International norms then ""begin to erode,"" he added, and ""other despots and authoritarian regimes can start looking and say, 'that's something we can get away with.'"" He described the intended U.S. response as ""limited in time and in scope, targeted at the specific task of degrading (al-Assad's) capabilities, and deterring the use of those weapons, again."" More than 100,000 killed in Syrian conflict . The United Nations has said more than 100,000 people -- including many civilians -- have been killed since the popular uprising spiraled into a civil war in 2011. In Washington, the resolution passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee set a 60-day deadline for use of force in Syria, with an option for an additional 30 days. An amendment accepted by the panel from Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Christopher Coons of Delaware added language to say the military response was intended to reverse Assad's battlefield momentum, a stronger objective than degrading the Syrian regime's chemical weapons capabilities as Hagel told the committee on Tuesday. If Assad ""remains in an advantageous position, he will never leave Syria,"" said McCain, who has been pushing for a more robust U.S. response. ""He has to know that he is losing and that way you get a negotiated settlement for his departure."" The resolution also makes clear there would be no U.S. boots on the ground as part of a response in Syria. A White House statement welcomed the panel's vote, saying ""the military action authorized in the resolution would uphold America's national security interests by degrading Assad's chemical weapons capability and deterring the future use of these weapons, even as we pursue a broader strategy of strengthening the opposition to hasten a political transition in Syria."" After the vote, senators on the panel made statements that explained their thinking, with some calling for more efforts to build an international coalition before any attack takes place. ""Vietnam started with U.S. advisers and a limited Naval presence. It led to an all-out war,"" noted Democratic Sen. Tom Udall of New Mexico, who opposed the resolution. Kerry, Hagel and Dempsey appeared before the Senate panel on Tuesday to press for approval of authorization. Tough questioning by House panel . The same trio then faced questions on Wednesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, with Royce saying the administration's Syria policy had been adrift for two years. At the same time, Royce acknowledged there were ""no easy answers"" on Syria, and attempting to deter chemical weapons use was worth considering despite public skepticism for U.S. military involvement. Kerry said Obama sought authorization for a response to the use of banned weapons, not a full military intervention. ""We are not asking America to go to war,"" he said. ""We all agree, there will be no American boots on the ground."" In response to a question, Hagel put the cost of the limited response under consideration at ""tens of millions"" of dollars. Most of the focus of administration lobbying has been on the House, where opposition by liberal Democrats and libertarian conservatives, as well as the bitterly partisan political environment of the Republican-led chamber, make passage of Obama's authorization proposal uncertain. House Speaker John Boehner and Cantor, the No. 2 Republican, both have endorsed a U.S. military response, but Wednesday's hearing showed widespread concerns and outside opposition from across the political spectrum. Polls also show that a majority of Americans oppose a U.S. military strike on Syria. In the Senate, a Democratic source familiar with Majority Leader Harry Reid's thinking told CNN that Reid is confident any authorization measure will pass his chamber. The source said it is likely 60 votes will be needed to overcome a filibuster, and Reid thinks the votes are there. Before that, however, lawmakers will hear from the Russian government, which is moving ahead with its efforts to lobby Congress in an attempt to undercut Obama on Syria. Moscow has sent an official request to congressional leaders to meet with them. ""We're planning the visit,"" a Russian Embassy spokesman told CNN, ""We can't tell you the exact time but it will be next week."" Boehner will not meet with the Russians, his spokesman said.","The White House welcomes Senate panel's support for a limited Syria strike .

"President Barack Obama responded on Monday to House Speaker John Boehner's offer to compromise on tax rate increases with his own compromise on both tax increases and spending cuts, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Obama's latest offer brings the two sides billions of dollars closer to a deal to avert the fiscal cliff, which promises tax increases on income of all levels and across-the-board spending cuts in the new year. For the first time, Boehner this weekend had offered to accept tax rate increases on household income over $1 million, sources said.  Obama, who had stood steadfast at the threshold of $250,000, on Monday offered Boehner a package which would raise rates on household income above $400,000. The president also offered ground on cuts to discretionary federal government spending.  His initial offers had included no cuts; his latest offer cuts of $200 billion, divided evenly between defense and non-defense programs. The two men met face to face at the White House on Monday for 45 minutes, their third such meeting in eight days, a sign of an acceleration in the fiscal cliff negotiations. Neither side favors returning income tax rates to 1990s levels on all income. Hours before news of the president's latest offer emerged, White House spokesman Jay Carney made it clear that more work needed to be done.  ""The president's proposal is the only proposal that we have seen that achieves the balance that is so necessary"" between revenue and cost-cutting, said Carney, who refused to discuss specifics. Congress had been scheduled to end its work last week, but legislators returned to Washington on Monday and leaders warned members to be prepared to stay until Christmas and return after the holiday until year-end. ""It appears at this stage -- we'll see if anything changes -- but it appears we're going to be coming back the day after Christmas to complete work on the fiscal cliff,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Monday.  Last week, U.S. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said a deal would have to be reached by Christmas to allow time for the legislative process to approve the required measure or measures by the end of the year. The source told CNN that Obama's latest offer includes $1.2 trillion in revenue increases on individual income and $1.22 trillion in spending reductions, though Boehner's office said the math adds up differently. ""Any movement away from the unrealistic offers the president has made previously is a step in the right direction, but a proposal that includes $1.3 trillion in revenue for only $930 billion in spending cuts cannot be considered balanced,"" Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said.  ""We hope to continue discussions with the president so we can reach an agreement that is truly balanced and begins to solve our spending problem."" A senior GOP House aide posited that one difference in the math is the way the White House and Republicans are handling the consumer price index, which takes into account changes in the quantity and prices of products. Republican aides estimate that the CPI would increase tax revenues by an additional $95 billion over Obama's estimated $1.2 trillion, putting the number closer to $1.3 trillion. They also do not count Obama's estimated $290 billion in savings on national debt interest accumulation because they do not consider these savings real cuts. Obama's plan, Republican aides said, does not include a 1-1 ratio of spending cuts and revenue. Obama's proposal includes $130 billion in spending savings due to changes in the CPI.  It is applied to many entitlement benefits, such as Social Security, to protect participants against rising prices. The chained CPI includes assumptions on consumer habits with regard to rising prices, such as seeking cheaper alternatives, and would result in smaller benefit increases in future years. Labor unions and advocacy groups for the elderly are expected to oppose it. Boehner has been under pressure from the White House, Democrats, the business community and some fellow Republicans to give up the staunch opposition to any increase in tax rates. Conservatives trying to shrink the federal government generally oppose increasing tax revenue. They are particularly opposed to higher tax rates because history shows that once rates go up, it is difficult to later reduce government revenue by lowering them again. Obama and Democrats argue that increased revenue, including higher tax rates on the wealthy, must be part of broader deficit reduction to prevent the middle class from getting hit too hard. The president's plan also includes one of his key demands on the national debt, a two-year extension of the debt ceiling being subject to periodic congressional votes under the so-called McConnell mechanism.  That allows the president to notify congress of a debt-ceiling increase. Congress could then take no action and let it go into effect or vote to deny the increase.  Without that mechanism, Congress would have to approve all debt-ceiling increases. An aide to Boehner said earlier any such increase would have to be offset by spending cuts and reforms.","President Barack Obama raises income cutoff for higher tax rates to $400,000 .

"Iran and the group known as the P5+1 have agreed to a four-month extension of negotiations toward a final comprehensive nuclear deal, two Western diplomats told CNN. The P5+1 includes Germany and the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain. Talks between world powers and Iran over that country's nuclear program are ""a historic opportunity for all of us to end a rather prolonged chapter,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in Vienna. A Sunday deadline was looming for negotiators to reach agreement on a comprehensive solution on Iran's nuclear program; Iran, in return, was seeking broad sanctions relief and access to international markets. The objective, Zarif said, ""is to ensure that Iran's nuclear program will always remain peaceful. I think that is scientifically possible. It doesn't require arbitrary red lines, arbitrary numbers. You just need to find scientific ways of making sure that Iran's nuclear program addresses a practical need. And that is what we have put on the table."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry lauded the progress that both sides have made in negotiations but said that ""very real gaps"" still exist in some areas. ""Diplomacy takes time, and persistence is needed to determine whether we can achieve our objectives peacefully,"" Kerry said Friday. ""To turn our back prematurely on diplomatic efforts when significant progress has been made would deny ourselves the ability to achieve our objectives peacefully."" Some analysts say, however, that a speech by Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei last week may have set just the kind of red lines that Zarif says should have no part in negotiations. Khamenei reiterated that he had faith in Zarif and his negotiating team but also said Iran must boost its enrichment capacity, according to Reuters. In Iran, residents had a mixed reaction to the extension. Fariba Gholizadeh, a graphic artist in Tehran, blamed Western powers for the failure to reach an agreement. ""It's the West that's trying to impose it's will on us,"" she said. ""Our position is clear. Why should we give up something that's our right, something other countries can have, according to international law."" Engineering student Mohamad Bagherzadeh said he still hopes the two sides can work out their differences in four months. ""Just the fact that they're talking and exchanging ideas is a good thing and it has people much more hopeful for a better future,"" he said.

"Fear over Ebola is growing as international leaders and health organizations struggle to try to stop the deadly epidemic in West Africa. The Ebola outbreak ""is moving faster than our efforts to control it,"" Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization, said in a statement Friday. ""This is an unprecedented outbreak accompanied by unprecedented challenges. And these challenges are extraordinary."" This is the first Ebola outbreak in West Africa and involves the most deadly strain in the Ebola virus family, Chan said. ""If the situation continues to deteriorate, the consequences can be catastrophic in terms of lost lives but also severe socioeconomic disruption and a high risk of spread to other countries."" One of those countries could be the United States, health officials have said. In fact, the U.S. Department of State announced Friday that it is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to bring home two U.S. citizens who have been infected by Ebola in Liberia. Here's what you need to know about the Ebola outbreak today: . How many people have died? As of Sunday, the World Health Organization had confirmed 909 cases and 485 deaths in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. It suspects that there may have been up to 1,323 cases and 729 deaths. ""The outbreak is by far the largest ever in the nearly four-decade history of this disease,"" Chan said. ""It is the largest in terms of numbers of cases and deaths. ... It is the largest in terms of geographical areas already affected and others at immediate risk of further spread."" CDC Director Tom Frieden said Thursday that it could take three to six months to stop the epidemic. Why is it spreading so quickly? First of all, there's no vaccine for Ebola. So health officials have to stop the infection by isolating patients to prevent further transmission. Past outbreaks have primarily occurred in rural areas, where people were not frequently traveling and infecting others. This outbreak has made it to several of the region's major cities, including Freetown, Sierra Leone; Monrovia, Liberia; and Conakry, Guinea. These cities have international airports, which opens up the possibility of infected patients traveling abroad. For example, American Patrick Sawyer became infected with Ebola in Liberia and traveled via plane to Lagos, Nigeria, where he died. Health officials are still tracing all the people he came in contact with along the way. The outbreak is ""taking place in areas with fluid population movements over porous borders, and it has demonstrated its ability to spread via air travel, contrary to what has been seen in past outbreaks,"" Chan said. ""Cases are occurring in rural areas which are difficult to access, but also in densely populated capital cities."" NIH: Ebola vaccine to be tested in human trials soon . Is Ebola is coming to the U.S.? On Thursday, a medical charter plane outfitted with an isolation pod left Cartersville, Georgia, about 5 p.m. The aircraft was scheduled to fly to Monrovia, Liberia, and will return with either Dr. Kent Brantly or Nancy Writebol, who were infected with Ebola while working for the aid group Samaritan's Purse in Liberia last week. The two patients will be evacuated in separate trips, according to Samaritan's Purse spokesman Todd Shearer. It is unclear who will be transported first but both evacuations ""should be completed by early next week."" Samaritan's Purse has described Brantly and Writebol as being in grave but stable condition. Several aid organizations, including the Peace Corps, are asking volunteers and nonessential personnel to leave the region. The evacuation of these staff members has begun, Samaritan's Purse said. Who approved that? The decision was ultimately that of Samaritan's Purse, Frieden told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. The organization worked with the CDC to arrange the evacuation. ""Our role at CDC is to make sure in the transportation and in the care, any risk of infection to others is kept to the absolute minimum,"" Frieden said. ""I know it creates a fear in people, but I really hope that people's fear won't outweigh their compassion."" Is the CDC ready to handle Ebola? Trust in the CDC has waned in recent months, after multiple lapses in proper lab procedure put workers -- and potentially the public -- at risk. Investigators found that scientists had transported dangerous biological materials in Ziploc bags and once sent a live sample of bird flu to a low-security lab ill-equipped to handle the virus. The investigation began in June, when workers based at the agency's headquarters in Atlanta were potentially exposed to anthrax after a lab failed to deactivate it. Congress grilled Frieden on July 16 over these and other incidents, saying they were ""completely unacceptable."" ""The CDC is supposed to be the gold standard"" for lab safety, Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pennsylvania, said at the hearing. ""This is not sound science, and this will not be tolerated."" Which prompts the question: If the CDC wasn't handling dangerous biological materials properly in a lab, is it ready to handle America's first Ebola patient? Frieden said that in the past, five people have arrived in the United States with other types of hemorrhagic fever; in all five cases, the patients were treated in hospitals, and no secondary infections occurred. And Medecins sans Frontieres has treated infectious disease abroad for decades without a death, he said. ""The stakes are higher with Ebola, but the risk is no higher. It's a virus easily deactivated with standard cleaning in hospitals."" Experts: U.S. health care system well-prepared for Ebola . When will the infected Americans be evacuated? Soon. The State Department said the two citizens would be evacuated in the ""coming days."" When it arrives, the plane will land at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Georgia, about 20 miles from the CDC's Atlanta headquarters, a Pentagon spokesman said. Then where will the patients go? The patients will be brought to Emory University, which is near CDC's headquarters, hospital officials told Gupta. They will likely be transported in an Emory ambulance or medical helicopter from the airport. Emory University Hospital has a specially built isolation unit that is designed to treat patients exposed to infectious diseases like Ebola, the hospital said in a statement Thursday. It is one of only four units in the United States. ""Emory University Hospital physicians, nurses and staff are highly trained in the specific and unique protocols and procedures necessary to treat and care for this type of patient,"" the statement said. ""These procedures are practiced on a regular basis throughout the year so we are fully prepared for this type of situation."" What treatment will they receive? There is no specific treatment for Ebola. Doctors can administer only ""supportive therapy,"" which means supporting the patient's own immune system as it tries to battle the infection. This usually involves intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration and shock. This therapy for Ebola patients could also include blood or platelet transfusions and oxygen therapy. Ebola can last two to three weeks, so patients would remain in isolation until their symptoms subside and tests come back negative for the virus. Should I be worried? When the infected aid workers return, it will be the first time someone infected with Ebola is known to have crossed into the United States. That realization has prompted fear among some on social media. But U.S. health experts don't seem concerned about it spreading for two reasons: . One, Ebola is aggressively infectious, which means that those infected are highly likely to get sick. But it's not very contagious, meaning it doesn't spread easily. It's transmitted only through bodily fluids while the infected patient is exhibiting symptoms. And two, experts say our health care system would be able to identify and contain the virus swiftly. Frieden said other aid workers returning to the United States will have their temperature taken every day for 21 days -- the longest period known for Ebola symptoms to appear after infection -- to ensure that they don't have the virus. Have other aid workers been affected? Yes. A well-known doctor fighting Ebola in Sierra Leone died this week after contracting the virus. ""To date, more than 60 health care workers have lost their lives in helping others. Some international staff are infected,"" Chan said. ""These tragic infections and deaths significantly erode response capacity.""","American patients infected with Ebola will be brought home in separate trips .

"So after all the hype, was the lost sleep and the sore necks from looking at the sky worth it? People throughout North America could ask that question Saturday, hours after witnessing a unique meteor shower that was visible in the middle of the night. Judging from social media responses, this cosmic event appeared to have little bang in some places, while delivering a few prize goods elsewhere. But for die-hard star geeks, there will be an Act II, an even bigger treat, as the last part of the shower -- a comet -- passes by Earth, beginning Saturday evening. Whatever the verdict, there will probably never be a second chance for the May Camelopardalids meteor shower. Many showers come annually, in October, December, January and April, said NASA meteor observer Bill Cooke. In August, for example, we will see the return of the spectacular Perseid meteor shower. But the Camelopardalids shower, named for the constellation the shooting stars appeared to fly out of, was a rare gift from the planet Jupiter. The biggest planet in the solar system bent the meteors' orbit with its powerful gravitational pull so that they would collide with Earth. ""Next year, it will tug the debris field away from the Earth, and we won't see a meteor shower, so this is kind of a one-shot deal,"" Cooke said. Rare comet pass . The debris field derives from the coming comet, which bears the uninspiring name 209P/LINEAR. Astronomers have stopped coming up with fancy nomenclature for the hundreds of comets they spot and instead give each new one a number and the name of the project that discovered it. LINEAR stands for Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research. Jupiter will fling the comet our way, too, causing it to fly by our planet at a distance of 5 million miles. ""A comfortable distance, which is good,"" Cooke said. Its core is 1 to 2 miles wide, and a direct hit to Earth would be disastrous. Even though 209P/LINEAR passes by every five years while orbiting the sun, this time around it will offer a rare sight to hobby astronomers. ""The comet normally doesn't pass this close,"" Cooke said. Anyone with a consumer model 3-inch-reflector telescope should be able to see it in the north sky late Wednesday, if the heavens are clear. Those who want a sneak peek through a more powerful telescope can get it from 6 p.m. ET Saturday via the online observatory service Slooh. To have 209P/LINEAR's debris field pass the Earth ahead of its comet is like putting the tail before the dog. Usually debris fields follow comets just like their tails do. Again, Jupiter was the culprit. It ripped off the debris field and threw it out in front of 209P/LINEAR. ""Jupiter is a big gravitational bully of the solar system,"" Cooke said. This particular comet and its field just happen to pass through that planet's orbit. After many passes around the solar system, the comet also doesn't have much of a tail left, so gazers shouldn't expect to see a long, stunning ribbon trailing it, just a short dash. Surprise package . Cooke said from the start that the Camelopardalids could be a star-studded gala or a dud. NASA couldn't predict it ahead of time, because the debris field was formed some 200 years ago, when astronomers couldn't see it, Cooke said. They merely knew that it was coming. ""It's kind of like being able to predict rain at 11:30 in the morning but not being able to predict a drizzle or a thunderstorm."" Reactions from shooting-star gazers across the country ran the gamut on social media, and judging by some, it did deliver fireworks. ""Izzi and I literally just saw and heard a meteor explode right before our eyes,"" .hannaH posted to Twitter . ""Just saw a awesomely bright meteor with a blue tail!! #MeteorShower,"" Twitter user Carmen said from Chicago. But it served up some anticlimax, too. A few netizens called it a complete bust. CNN iReporter Jean-Francois Gout had only one word to describe the event: ""Disappointing."" Gout stayed up for more than seven hours to watch the much anticipated meteor shower from Lake Monroe near Bloomington, Indiana. Despite the poor showing, Gout still managed to photograph a few passing meteors overhead. But the night was not a complete loss. ""It was a great excuse to spend the night out in a remote area with some good friends and enjoy the night and the first fireflies of the season, which sometimes we would think for a fraction of a second were meteors,"" he said. Despite the lackluster showing, iReporter Cat Connor enjoyed staying up to watch the celestial event. She photographed the meteor shower over Mono Lake in California, and she wasn't alone. There were dozens of other photographers camped out at the lake hoping to catch a glimpse of Camelopardalids. ""There were many photographers there. All you could see were the lights of their cameras scattered around the lake,"" she wrote. ""Guess anyone who invited someone on a date to watch the 'meteor shower' is looking like a pretty big creep right about now,"" New Yorker Kevin Depew tweeted. Some found moments of serendipity in the event. Barry Shupp, a Pennsylvania astrophotographer and iReporter, wrote that he was shooting time exposures for the meteor shower when he noticed the International Space Station ""creeping along the horizon."" ""Quickly setting up a shot, I also captured a meteor in the upper right of photo,"" he said. A tweet from Los Angeles Times reporter Deborah Netburn seemed to sum up neatly reactions to the shower. ""Watched the #Camelopardalids from the Eastern Sierras. Not exactly a meteor storm, but the 3 I saw were so cool. Long streaks across the sky.""

"A divided U.S. House voted Tuesday to let the government borrow enough money to pay its bills for the next year, sending the measure to the Senate in an effort by Republican leaders to avoid another politically damaging legislative impasse over spending. In the 221-201 vote, less than three dozen of the majority House Republicans joined almost all of the chamber's 200 Democrats to pass the proposal increasing the debt ceiling that lacked any deficit-reduction provisions sought by the GOP's conservative wing. The vote followed a reversal in strategy by Republican House Speaker John Boehner after he and other leaders pushed the night before to attach a provision repealing cuts to military pensions to the debt limit measure. President Barack Obama and Democrats rejected any negotiation on what they called the responsibility of Congress to maintain the full faith and credit of the United States by ensuring sufficient borrowing authority to meet all obligations. White House spokesman Jay Carney called the House vote ""a positive step in moving away from the political brinkmanship that's a needless drag on our economy."" Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said last week the debt ceiling must be raised by February 27, or the nation would risk a technical default. A Senate vote could come as soon as Tuesday night or on Wednesday, hastened to beat a possible major winter storm expected to hit the region on Wednesday night. GOP change in tactics . Until Tuesday, House Republicans insisted that any increase in the borrowing limit had to come attached to deficit-reduction provisions. At a closed-door meeting on Monday, they discussed a plan to increase the debt ceiling until March 2015 -- past the upcoming congressional elections in November -- while also repealing cuts to military pensions that were part of the recently passed federal budget. Less than 18 hours later, though, Boehner told reporters the GOP proposal couldn't pass because ""we don't have 218 votes, and when you don't have 218 votes, you have nothing."" Some conservatives oppose raising the debt ceiling under any circumstance, while Democrats have made it clear they would unanimously reject any measure that tacked other provisions onto an increase in the borrowing limit. Without a purely Republican majority, Boehner decided to split up the GOP plan by holding separate votes on repealing the military pension cuts and a clean debt ceiling increase. The House easily passed the military pension measure earlier on Tuesday, sending it the Senate for further consideration. In the later vote on the debt ceiling, only 28 of the 227 Republicans who voted wound up siding with 193 Democrats to pass it, while 199 Republicans and two Democrats opposed it. Boehner earlier told reporters he would vote for it, and his top deputy -- House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia -- also supported the measure. Some Republicans not sure . Republicans facing pressure from conservatives ahead of the November vote were reluctant to back any kind of hike in the borrowing limit, a core issue for the political right because it represents rising federal debt. Despite his support for the proposal, Boehner put the blame for needing a ""clean"" debt-ceiling bill with no deficit reduction provisions on Obama, saying the rising federal debt was his fault. ""It's the President driving up the debt and the President wanted to do nothing about the debt that's occurring, will not engage in our long-term spending problem,"" Boehner said. ""And so, let his party give him the debt ceiling increase that he wants."" At the same time, Boehner declared himself disappointed about what he called a ""lost opportunity"" to address unsustainable federal spending. Senate strategy . In the Senate, GOP leaders urged against a filibuster of a clean debt-ceiling bill by their colleagues. By refraining from a filibuster, which would require 60 votes to overcome, the Senate's 45 Republicans can oppose the increase in the borrowing limit without getting accused of obstructing the 55-member Democratic caucus from passing it. However, GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a leader of the conservative tea party wing in Congress, said Tuesday he would filibuster the measure to force a 60-vote threshold. Senate leaders had wanted to vote on the debt ceiling plan no later than Wednesday, before the arrival of the storm. It was unclear if Cruz's threatened filibuster would prevent an immediate vote from taking place. If Congress doesn't pass a debt ceiling measure Wednesday, further action was unlikely until February 25 -- two days before the Treasury chief's deadline -- because of a shortened congressional work schedule in coming weeks due in part to the Presidents Day break. Republicans across the ideological spectrum agree that another round of political brinksmanship could harm their party after it got blamed for October's federal government shutdown. A recent CNN/ORC International poll found that 54% of respondents would blame congressional Republicans for a failure to raise the debt ceiling, while 29% would blame Obama and 12% would blame both.","Less than three dozen Republicans join almost all of the Democrats to back bill .

"A private meeting on Capitol Hill with House Democrats and White House officials on Wednesday became heated when rank-and-file members expressed frustration about continued Obamacare problems, according to multiple sources in the room. One congressional Democrat who attended the meeting said senior Obama administration officials Mike Hash and David Simas really ""got hit"" by House Democrats about everything from the troubled website to the broken presidential promise that people can keep the insurance plans they like. The most pressing political challenge for House Democrats will come this Friday when they will have to vote on a House Republican plan by Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan that allows people to keep their policies if they want to. Insurance companies have begun canceling certain individual plans mainly due to Obamacare, creating an unexpected hardship for many who could soon find themselves without coverage or wind up facing higher costs for new plans they may not want. In California alone, more than 1 million people have received policy termination notices from several insurers because their plans do not meet minimum requirements under the Affordable Care Act, the state's insurance commissioner said this week. Insurers have, in a large number of cases, temporarily extended the time frame for ending those agreements. Several lawmakers -- even liberals who adamantly support Obamacare -- stood and warned the officials that the White House must come up with a solution before the vote. As CNN first reported on Tuesday, many House Democrats are feeling so much pressure from constituents on this issue that they may feel compelled to vote yes for political reasons. ""Members want to keep their promises to their constituents, which is that they would have affordable insurance  -- if they want to keep the plan they have -- they would keep it,"" said Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio. ""We would offer broader insurance alternatives so that people would have more competitive pricing."" Democratic congressional sources have told CNN that Friday is a de facto deadline for the administration to come up with a fix. The preference would be an administrative remedy that circumvents the polarized Congress. But if that is not possible, Democrats are demanding the White House offer a legislative solution that they can offer as an alternative to the GOP plan. Administration officials came to the meeting to try to convince House Democrats not to vote for the Upton bill, saying it would gum up the system and result in higher premiums for most Americans, sources told CNN. ""They were talking about the ultimate impact of voting for it. That, in fact, it would allow plans that had high deductibles, very poor coverage -- which of course we want to get rid of,"" said Jan Schakowsky, D-Illinois. Democratic Rep. Jose Serrano of New York told reporters he thinks something will ""develop over the next 24 hours."" White House spokesman Jay Carney said ""you can expect"" the Obama administration to announce plans for addressing health policy cancellations under Obamacare ""sooner rather than later."" Carney said President Barack Obama has asked ""his team"" to come up with policy options, suggesting they were moving quickly. He again rejected the Upton bill as ""not an effective fix"" because it opens up the plans to anyone, not just the people who's plans are being canceled. Lawmakers also expressed frustration with the HealthCare.gov website, the chief portal for people who want to sign up for Obamacare through the federal government. It's October 1 launch was a debacle and the administration is scrambling to get it running up to speed. White House tech expert says healthcare.gov getting better . Source: Nov. deadline possible . Rep. Anna Eschoo of California asked administration officials to stop using ""red lines"" they may have to cross and make the public relations problems worse for Democrats. For example, sources in the meeting said she is worried that if the the website is not running smoothly by November 30 as the administration has promised, the political problems for Democrats will be worse. Though, the focus is chiefly on the House bill over cancellations. It would allow affected insurance plans to extend into next year and gut a major part of the Affordable Care Act by allowing anyone to purchase them, even though the existing policies don't meet the tougher requirements of the Obamacare initiative. Can Congress really save insurance plans lost under Obamacare? Among other things, the law prohibits discrimination for preexisting conditions and mandates coverage for mental health, prenatal care and other issues. This is a primary reason why insurance companies are dropping existing coverage. Cancellations drive concern . Although the rocky rollout of the Obamacare website and low enrollment figures through Wednesday -- just over 100,000 -- are embarrassments for the President and Democrats in Congress who rammed through the health law in 2010 without Republican support, it is the policy cancellations that are really driving Democrats to put more pressure the White House. Obama has apologized to those losing their coverage despite his assurances to the contrary and appears to be taking a hit for his Obamacare woes, according to the latest polling. His approval rating among American voters has dropped to its lowest number in Quinnipiac University polling since he became President with new doubts being raised about trust. Pressure to come up with a fix . Rep. Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, told reporters on Tuesday that Obama needs to come up with a solution ""sooner rather than later."" New York Rep. Steve Israel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, criticized the House GOP plan, saying he believed it would increase premiums and remove consumer protections. ""We should do something so long as it actually fixes the problem and doesn't make the problem worse."" Israel told reporters Tuesday, saying it would be helpful if the White House came out with a proposal before Friday's House vote. But Rep. John Larsen of Connecticut,  a loyal liberal and former House Democratic leader, said he hasn't seen details of the House GOP bill, but said he thought it could ""make sense"" and that there ""could be support"" depending on the approach. Hoyer said earlier he hadn't ruled out being open to Upton's bill, but his spokeswoman says he's now opposed since Upton has said he won't make changes and Democratic leaders will likely urge their caucus to vote against it. More pressure on Obama . Boosting pressure further on Obama was former President Bill Clinton, who said on Tuesday that the President should find a way to uphold his initial promises about health policies. Clinton: Obama should 'honor commitment' on keeping health plans . A growing number of Democrats have called for changes or delays to the program as many face  tough reelection bids in 2014 and are feeling pressure from challengers and constituents. Obamacare rattling Democratic nerves . Although he didn't go nearly as far as Clinton, Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois, said he is open to changes as well and noted that Obama should have been more careful with his words in the first place. Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, introduced a narrower bill than what House Republicans are planning with Upton's plan and said that she has growing support in the Senate, including Dianne Feinstein, Joe Manchin, Mark Pryor and Kay Hagan -- all Democrats. She noted her proposal would allow people who have individual insurance, which she says makes up about 5% of the market, to keep their coverage. Insurers would have to notify those customers what minimum coverage requirements are not being met. A Senate Democratic leadership aide told CNN that White House officials will go to Capitol Hill on Thursday to meet with Senate Democrats about looking for a fix.

"With Greece probably heading for an exit from the euro, the European and global economies may be facing disaster. However, there is still time for European leaders to reverse this destructive dynamic with one simple, outside-the-box solution: Instead of pushing Greece out of the eurozone, Germany should voluntarily withdraw and reissue its beloved deutsche mark. The analysis of the problems of the euro and the European Union has long been upside down, focused on the debt and competitive weaknesses of the so-called peripheral countries (Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland) and especially of Greece. But issues of debt and competitiveness existed and were dealt with rather easily long before the euro arrived, through periodic devaluation of the currencies of the less-competitive countries against those of the more competitive countries, and especially against the deutsche mark. The problem now is not the weaknesses of the periphery, it's the excessive competitive strength of Germany. Not only is the German economy inherently strong as a result of the high productivity of its workforce, its exports have added competitiveness because the euro is undervalued as far as Germany is concerned. Because it is the common currency of the eurozone countries, the value of the euro reflects the average of their combined competitiveness. But Germany's competitiveness is far above the average. So, for Germany, the euro is too weak. This is why Germany has been accumulating chronic trade surpluses on the scale of the Chinese. As long as the rest of the eurozone countries are locked in the euro with Germany, the only way for them to become more competitive is to become, well, more Germanic, through austerity measures that cut government spending, reduce welfare budgets, cut wages and raise unemployment. This is, of course, what they have been doing for the past two years. The aim has been to achieve export-led growth. But because Germany is so hypercompetitive and has been unwilling to stimulate its own economy to achieve higher consumption, its eurozone partners have not been able to increase exports to it and have had thus to compete with it in exporting to the likes of China and the United States. That hasn't been working very well, and now the consequences of grinding austerity are beginning to tear the political and social fabric even of countries like the Netherlands, which until quite recently were enthusiastically echoing the German call for austerity and growth led by trade with countries outside the EU. But it is not clear that the eurozone can sustain the social and political pain of austerity long enough and on the scale necessary to eventually achieve competitive parity with Germany. The alternative is for Germany to revert to the deutsche mark. That would immediately result in appreciation of the German currency and competitive devaluation of the euro for the remaining eurozone countries. Germany would tend to buy more while selling less, and vice versa for the rest of the eurozone. The extra consumption that Germany will not deliver via stimulus policies would be automatically delivered by currency revaluation. The single most essential element of a euro rescue has always been one form or another of a euro bond guaranteed jointly by all eurozone member countries. What the U.S. Treasury bond is to the U.S. economy, the euro bond would be to the EU. The main obstacle has been Germany's insistence that it would not guarantee payments on bonds for the benefit of other European countries. German reversion to the deutsche mark would remove this obstacle, and with no further German opposition, the remainder of the eurozone could move ahead to establish a true euro bond, along with a unified treasury function to match the unified banking function of the European Central Bank. Some may object that German backing would still be required for the eurozone and a euro bond to be viable. That is correct, and Germany would indeed remain committed to the eurozone for a number of reasons. It would need the eurozone more than ever to buy its increasingly expensive exports. The Bundesbank (Germany's central bank) would undoubtedly sell deutsche marks against euros to mitigate appreciation, and the resulting accumulation of euros would be invested in the new euro bonds. This in turn might inspire the European Central Bank to initiate quantitative easing programs that would stimulate the entire EU economy. The cost to Germany of saving Europe will be a hit to exports and perhaps a temporary rise in unemployment, but a return to the deutsche mark would attract a flood of capital to Germany and thereby spur investment while holding interest rates and inflation down. The real question is whether the cost of slower export growth and increased unemployment is less than that of paying for Greece, then Spain, etc.  Somehow, the ""unknown"" risks of a German exit from the euro appear more manageable, more quantifiable and in some ways more familiar a challenge than endless austerity, social unrest and political polarization.","Writers: To salvage eurozone, Germany, not Greece, should withdraw .

"Congressional negotiators had no agreements to report Saturday, but they issued positive reports on their talks to end a partial government shutdown and avert a default on government debt. ""Cordial"" was the word Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, used to describe his ""preliminary"" discussions with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. ""Good"" discussions were going on among Senate leaders, said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, ""so I think all of us want to support those efforts, and hopefully they bear fruit over the weekend."" Supporters stand by representatives and government shutdown . For all the positive talk, the only actions Saturday fell into the ""no"" category: . --Republican leaders said President Barack Obama rejected their proposal for a six-week debt limit extension. --The Senate defeated a procedural measure to extend the debt limit with no strings attached. --Reid said a proposal by a bipartisan group of senators, led by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, is no longer on the table because it treated opening the government as a ""concession."" Reid continues to demand that any plan include a ""clean"" bill with no strings attached that raises the debt limit and reopens the government. Countdown to default . The Treasury Department says it will be unable to pay the government's bills unless the debt limit is increased by Thursday. The partial shutdown of government services has been in effect since October 1. 7 crazy side effects from the shutdown . Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, said Saturday the consequences of a failure to raise the debt limit would be dire for economies around the world. She spoke to CNN's Richard Quest at an Institute of International Finance conference in Washington. ""You know, I've just spent the last two days with representatives of about 188 countries around the world.  I wouldn't say they are confident.  I would say they are concerned, and they are very anxious to see this crisis resolved, because they know it's going to impact on their economy,"" Lagarde said. Senate Democrats meet with president . Senate Democrats met with Obama for 75 minutes Saturday afternoon. A Senate Democratic leadership aide said the party is unified. ""Democrats are willing to negotiate on anything Republicans want to discuss as soon as we reopen the government and pay our bills,"" said the aide. Another Democratic source said party leaders regard Republicans as lacking a coherent position. They hope McConnell can ""cut through the clutter,"" the source told CNN's Dana Bash. The sources, who are familiar with the talks, spoke on the condition of anonymity so they could speak candidly. Despite the lack of agreement, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said progress was being made. ""I think our Republican colleagues are moving in our direction with the fact that Obamacare is not a major part of the discussion anymore among most all Senate and many House Republicans,"" he said. No votes on Sunday . Before the White House meeting, the Senate's second highest-ranking Democrat, Richard Durbin of Illinois, told CNN's Deirdre Walsh that Democrats hoped to reach agreement with Republican negotiators before stock markets open Monday. Even if that optimistic timetable could be met, a deal could not be voted upon Sunday. Will 2014 election solve anything? The Senate is scheduled to come back into session at 1 p.m. ET Sunday, but no votes are planned and Senators have been told their presence is not required. The House is not scheduled to meet until Monday afternoon. Even as he demanded a ""clean"" bill, Reid said it was encouraging that McConnell had approached him to start their weekend talks. ""I hope that our talking is some solace to the American people and the world,"" Reid said. He said McConnell had approached him. ""This hasn't happened until now,"" Reid said. Obama-Boehner talks stall . Republican leadership told the Republican caucus during a Saturday morning meeting that the president will not accept their proposal to raise the debt limit for six weeks. Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, told CNN Saturday that ""the President rejected our deal."" Paul Ryan steps into budget fight . The standstill came after a Friday afternoon phone call between Boehner and Obama in which they decided to keep talking. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Illinois, said the President is waiting for a better offer. ""It doesn't seem like the White House is serious at all about entering negotiations with us until they see what comes out of the Senate. If they get something out of the Senate that's weaker than our negotiated position, it obviously strengthens their position,"" Kinzinger said. While Democrats flat out rejected Boehner's proposal, even some Republicans didn't like it. That's because it lacked a mechanism in the House proposal to immediately reopen the government, which has been partially shut down since October 1, prompting the furlough of hundreds of thousands of workers, the closing of national parks and an increase in public anger.","Senate Democrats hope McConnell will ""cut through the clutter"" of GOP positions .

"Josh Miller never gave much thought to where his car, bed or toothpaste came from until an aluminum plant in his hometown of Ravenswood, West Virginia, shut down about four years ago. The closure left 650 people without a job, including Miller's father-in-law, in a town of roughly 3,800, triggering a familiar pattern. The unemployment rate in Jackson County more than doubled, businesses shuttered and Ravenswood's quaint downtown became a ghost town. Miller had been vaguely aware that American manufacturing jobs were going away, but now he knew what that could mean for an entire community. He wondered how an average American like him could change the tide. Raising awareness of what's still made in the United States seemed like a good start, he decided, and embarked on a mission to live entirely off American-made goods for 30 days. It didn't take long for him to discover that it's impossible, especially while trying to maintain a typical middle-class existence that includes smartphones and clothing from ubiquitous big box stores. He made the challenge harder by hitting the road and traveling the country, interviewing entrepreneurs and small businesses to find out what it takes to do business in the United States. He documented his efforts in the film, ""Made in USA: The 30 Day Journey,"" which is being screened through independent viewings across the country. Share your story: Transforming hobby to job . Miller spent nights sleeping on floors and rinsing off from a bucket of water because he couldn't find American beds, shower or sinks. But the lessons learned are as relevant as ever, especially as the country looks for ways to boost employment and bring American manufacturing into the 21st century, he said. ""Despite what you might hear, a lot of entrepreneurs and small businesses are making it work,"" he said. ""Our fate as a country is tied to our economic prosperity and given what I've seen I believe there's still room for us in the manufacturing era."" The challenge has now become a way of life whenever he can help it, he said. Checking product labels for country of origin is now a part of his shopping routine, he said. He has also immersed himself in online communities that share information about where to find American brands, products and companies. ""Just because you can't live 100% off American-made goods doesn't mean you can't make a difference,"" he said. ""We're in a global economy so it doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing proposition. But if you change just a little bit of your lifestyle it can make a difference."" Made in USA: The short list . The people he met shared his view that a little bit of effort can go a long way for small businesses trying to make it. It's not just a matter of blind patriotism, but of supporting companies that model fair business and labor practices -- even if they don't manufacture in the United States. ""It's not always possible to live off exclusively American made goods because some products simply are not manufactured here and other items are not native to our country,"" said Sarah Mazzone, founder of made in usa challenge, which shares resources and information for buying American-made products. ""For many electronics, there is no currently available made in USA option. For these purchases, I suggest minimizing your footprint as a consumer by buying used,"" she said. ""Other items like oils or certain foods may not naturally grow in our country. For those products, I recommend buying fair-trade certified."" Plenty of things are still made in the United States, even though the average American consumer doesn't get their hands on them on a daily basis, Gardner Carrick with The Manufacturing Institute said. Most American manufacturing jobs focus on heavy machinery, like aircraft, cars and supply chain parts, along with chemicals and energy products. Still, rising costs of doing business overseas and relatively affordable energy are making reshoring more attractive to businesses, Carrick said. Manufacturing has made a ""strong showing"" in the last four years in terms of employment and output, with signs of continued growth, Carrick said. In 2012, manufacturers contributed $1.87 trillion to the economy, about 11.9% of the GDP, up from $1.73 trillion in 2011, according to NAM. For every $1 spent in manufacturing, another $1.48 is added to the economy. As far as consumer goods are concerned, the average American should have no trouble finding food, beverages, paper products or toiletries from the United States, which Miller learned early on. A trip to the grocery store nets a toothbrush, shaving cream and food, including protein bars and gummy worms. That was a source of relief for Miller, a ""bacon and eggs kind of guy"" who was worried about having to just eat fruits and vegetables for breakfast during his 30-day experiment. The people he met on his journey underscored the fact that even products made in the United States are made of materials sourced from other countries. A tailor in Charleston, West Virginia, carries suiting made from British wool, German lining and Japanese buttons stitched together with silk thread from China -- all sewn together by ""immigrants in Chicago,"" Tony the tailor tells Miller. Miller took his challenge to more than a dozen cities and towns on an estimated budget of $30,000, partially raised through an Indiegogo campaign, driving American rental cars and staying in Red Roof hotels whenever possible to stay true to his mission. Eventually, he reclaims his smartphone from his friend and showers more frequently. But he hopes the point has been made. ""Advanced manufacturing will be the next revolution in this country,"" Miller said. ""It may not look the same as it did in late 30s and 40s, but it will return America to prosperity.""","Filmmaker tours country trying to live entirely off products made in the USA .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Blood clots from a long period of inactivity killed a woman who died last month on a waiting room floor at a New York hospital, the state's medical examiner said Friday. Surveillance video shows Esmin Green on the hospital floor for more than an hour before anyone helps her. The death of Esmin Green attracted media attention worldwide when a security camera captured hospital employees and other patients appearing to ignore her when she slumped out of a chair and began convulsing on the floor. The Jamaican immigrant had been involuntarily admitted to Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, on June 18 for what the hospital described as ""agitation and psychosis."" The security video, released earlier this month by the New York Civil Liberties Union, showed that the mother of six waited in a chair for nearly 24 hours before she fell on the floor on June 19. An hour went by before a hospital employee nudged Green, 49, with her foot and summoned help. The NYCLU alleged that hospital records were falsified to show that Green had been ""sitting quietly in the waiting room"" a little more than 10 minutes after she had stopped moving and 48 minutes after she slid to the floor. Green's autopsy reveals that she died from pulmonary thromboemboli -- blood clots that formed in her legs and eventually made their way into her lungs, according to Ellen Borakove, the medical examiner's spokeswoman. The clots came from deep vein thrombosis, which complicated Green's chronic paranoid schizophrenia. Many people afflicted with deep vein thrombosis are unaware they have the condition, but symptoms including pain or swelling in the leg or shortness of breath. Drugs that stop the clots from forming can help and can also prevent existing clots from growing larger. Doctors recommend that people with deep vein thrombosis avoid long periods of inactivity and frequently exercise their legs during long trips. After the security videos were released, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, which oversees the hospital, said it was ""shocked and distressed by this situation. It is clear that some of our employees failed to act based on our compassionate standards of care."" Seven workers, including doctors, nurses and security guards, have been fired or suspended since Green's death, the corporation said. It's not clear whether any of the employees have appealed the disciplinary actions against them. The agency, which acknowledged the discrepancy in the hospital records, said it referred the matter to law enforcement and is cooperating with the investigation. Green's relatives say they plan to file a $25 million lawsuit against the city and the hospital and have called for criminal charges against hospital workers. Kings County Hospital is already the subject of a lawsuit filed in May 2007 alleging that conditions at the facility are filthy. Patients are often forced to sleep in plastic chairs or on floors covered in urine, feces and blood while waiting for beds, the groups allege, and often go without basic hygiene such as showers, clean linens and clean clothes. The lawsuit claims that patients who complain face physical abuse and are injected with drugs to keep them docile. The hospital lacks ""the minimal requirements of basic cleanliness, space, privacy, and personal hygiene that are constitutionally guaranteed even to convicted felons,"" according to the suit. The video of Green's death sent the organizations back into court July 1, demanding immediate reform. Among the reforms agreed to in court by the hospital are additional staffing; checking of patients every 15 minutes; and limiting to 25 the number of patients in the psychiatric emergency ward, officials said. In addition, the hospital said it is expanding crisis-prevention training for staff; expanding space to prevent overcrowding; and reducing patients' wait time for release, treatment or placement in an inpatient bed.","Autopsy says blood clots caused by long period of inactivity killed Esmin Green .

"Sarah Wagner's interest in American manufacturing began with a family road trip. She and her husband loaded up their motor home in summer 2011 and visited small towns across the country whose fate seemed to be tied to the presence of industry. Where plants and factories had closed down, they found empty main streets with boarded-up storefronts. In other places, such as Forest City, Iowa, home to the Winnebago factory, they found vibrant communities where they could tour manufacturing facilities and witness the pride employees took in their work. When the trip was over, she started a Twitter account to share resources for all things made stateside. As USA Love List has evolved into a website, Wagner has learned that even though she can find plenty of goods made in the United States, it's impossible to live off them. But she said the holiday season is the perfect time to experiment with how far she can go. For the second year in a row, Wagner has pledged to buy as many gifts as possible made in the United States. Knowing where to start can be a challenge, but Wagner and others for whom conscious consumerism means buying American say there are many places to check out, from craft fairs, Etsy and specialty boutiques to e-commerce. Made in America: The short list . ""Gift-giving creates the perfect opportunity to try to buy American. You have extra time to research, and you have flexibility in what you choose to buy,"" said the married mother of two from Philadelphia. ""I'm a realist. I know that it's impossible to buy entirely American-made products year-round, but I also know there's a lot of wonderful American-made products, made by proud Americans, and it's worth my time to look for them."" USA Love List: Holiday gift guide . Wagner isn't alone. Motivated by a desire to boost the domestic economy or doubts over outsourcing, some Americans are making an effort to shop local for holiday gifts this year. It's a niche market, but it's one that has been growing in recent few years, and brands are starting to take notice. A growing number of small companies have been catering to the desire for American-made clothing and accessories, fueled in large part by style blogs touting the benefits of heritage brands. Well spent: 50 Under $50 . On a larger scale, Apple announced last week that it would shift some of its production back to the United States, citing customer demand for American-made products. Though some have characterized the announcement as a publicity ploy that won't do much to alter Apple's manufacturing operations, it follows a continuing pattern of American companies bringing manufacturing back home due to rising labor, supply and production costs in China. Some say buying American is a drop in the bucket when it comes to boosting the domestic economy, but experts agree that every bit counts. Manufacturing has the highest multiplier effect of any industry, meaning that it benefits other sectors that supports its operations. ""Anytime something is manufactured in the United States it's going to have greater gains in terms of jobs than something made overseas,"" said Chad Moutray, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. Still, Apple's announcement won't help Wagner. Her son wants an iPod for Christmas, and she's going to get it for him despite the fact that it's assembled in China and will continue to be made there. (Apple only plans to manufacture some of its line of Macintosh computers in the United States.) Otherwise, just about every gift on Wagner's holiday shopping list is made in the United States or locally sourced. The only other exception is a Skippyjon Jones children's picture book, which is written by an American author, and published by an American company, but printed in China. But pajamas bearing the cartoon cat's likeness that will accompany the book are made in America, she said. Electronics and appliances made in the United States are hard to come by, but jewelry, clothing, accessories, beauty products, even holiday decorations are easier to find than you might think, she said. Buying American for the holidays hasn't changed her budget significantly, she said. She'll spend about $700 on family, friends and white elephant gifts, about the same as in recent years. The only difference is that she spends a bit more time searching. She's giving most of her relatives food gift baskets from local specialty markets, bakeries that make their own products or confectioners across the country. Others are getting hats, sweaters and bags made in the United States from brands whose products are available online. Big-box retailers sometimes surprise with their ""Made in the USA"" labels, she said. She has found cast-iron cookware and paper products at Costco. Target and Wal-Mart sell some beauty products, candles and paper products that make great Secret Santa gifts. ""Once you start looking, it's amazing what you find,"" she said. ""When you start to look, you notice patterns. I find new brands every time I go in."" Sarah Mazzone is also on mission to buy only American for the holiday season. She runs the website made in usa challenge, which she started in 2011 with the goal of finding and sharing domestically produced goods, from toys and clothes to food, wine and dog toys. Made in USA Challenge: Holiday Gift Guide . She spent about $300 on jewelry, toys and clothing from Etsy and e-commerce sites that she has learned about through her site. She even found a coloring book at Urban Outfitters. The only non-American product is a stuffed animal for her 2-year-old son, she said. When she can't find something made in the United States, she turns to thrift stores, which is where she found a life-size sea turtle toy for $8. ""At least I'm keeping it out of a landfill,"" she said. Made in USA Challenge: Holiday gift ideas for kids . Children and teens are often the hardest to shop for because they often want electronics, licensed products or brand-name clothing that is likely made in China -- and that's OK. ""You don't have to be hard core about it,"" Mazzone said. ""Just set a goal and try it in little amounts. Every little bit makes a difference."" For the brand-agnostic, clothing, accessories and jewelry are available in a variety of price points, thanks to a growing resurgence of interest in American-made fashion, Mazzone said. Most of it carries a higher price tag than foreign-made counterparts, but if you're going to splurge on a gift, there's no better time than holidays, Mazzone said. For budget-conscious shoppers, it could just mean spending the same amount as planned on fewer, more meaningful products. ""It's a matter of priorities and choosing quality over quantity,"" she said. ""People didn't used to expect Santa to bring them five to 10 gifts under the tree. It might be more of an investment, but you could end up with fewer disposable products that'll be in your family for generations.""

"Thinking of having a baby? You may want to consider moving to Finland -- the best place in the world to be a mother, according to Save the Children's 14th Mothers' Index. The index, part of the group's annual State of the World's Mothers report, is intended to illustrate the link between maternal and child well-being. Each year, nearly three million babies die within their first month of life -- more than a third die on their day of birth -- and 287,000 women die from pregnancy or childbirth, according to the report. The index ranked countries according to five indicators of a mother's well-being: maternal health (the risk of maternal mortality); children's well-being (the mortality rate of children under five); educational status (number of years of formal schooling a woman receives); economic status (gross national income per capita); and political status (the participation of women in national government). Finland was followed closely by its Nordic neighbors and other Western European countries. Australia was the only non-European country to place in the top 10. The United States ranked 30th, performing poorly in under-five mortality rates, maternal death, and political participation, compared to other highly-developed countries. Industrialized countries account for only 1% of newborns dying on their first day of life, but among them the U.S. has the highest mortality rate, with approximately 11,300 deaths each year. The report attributed this to the country's high rate of premature births (one in eight births) -- the second highest in the industrialized world. The U.S. also has the highest teenage birth rate of any industrialized country -- and teenage mothers in the U.S. tend to have less education, prenatal care, and financial resources than their older counterparts. Sub-Saharan African countries ranked as the 10 worst places to be a mother, with the Democratic Republic of the Congo coming in last place. While newborn, child, and maternal death rates have declined across the developing world in the past two decades, the report found that progress has been the slowest in this region. Developing countries lack basic healthcare for women and their babies before, during, and after delivery, accounting for the majority of newborn and maternal deaths.

"German police have released a photograph of the 17-year-old known only as ""Ray"" who turned up at Berlin City Hall last year after claiming to have been living in the woods for five years. The release of the photograph, along with details of his appearance and scant possessions at the time of his discovery, is part of an effort by German authorities to unravel the mysterious identity of the boy who speaks English and a little German and what is his family background. The boy only knew his name, his date of birth of June 20, 1994, and his parents' first names. After months of investigation, German authorities said they are stumped on who the boy really is. The boy named Ray told authorities upon his discovery last September that he had been living in the woods with his father, Ryan, but decided to come out of the wilderness after his father had died, investigators said. The boy couldn't explain why his father died, authorities said. Investigators have been unable to find the father's body as the boy was unable to name or show the place he buried his father in the forest underneath some stones, officials said. ""They were hiking with the help of maps and a compass only and stayed in tents or caves overnight,"" Berlin authorities said in a statement released Tuesday. The boy provided police with ""some vague information"" about his mother, saying her name was Doreen, and he wore a golden-colored necklace around his neck with the pendant ""D,"" the first letter of his mother's name, police said. His mother died in a car accident when the boy was 12 years old, but he doesn't remember the details of the accident, authorities said. The boy presumes the scars on his face were caused by the accident, police said. After his father also died last August, the boy roamed north for five days until he arrived to Berlin City Hall and asked for help last September 5, authorities said. The teenager cannot ""specify anything about cities, countries or regions him and his father had travelled through,"" authorities said in a statement. American woman missing in Japan . German authorities have been trying to establish the boy's identity through Interpol. A guardian has been appointed, authorities said. ""The Youth Office and the Berlin Police have great doubts on the boy's story. That is the reason why the Youth Office now decided to publish a photo of 'Ray' and ask for your help,"" authorities said in a statement. In releasing a photo of the boy, taken last September, authorities also provided a physical description of him: 16 to 20 years old; about 5-foot-11 or 180 centimeters; dark-blonde medium length hair; blue eyes; athletic physique; teeth, fingernails and hands all conveying a neat impression; three scars on his forehead; three small scars on his chin; one scar of 1 centimeter in length on his right arm; and a complete set of teeth with no dental work obvious. The boy is able to read and write and spoke mainly in English with a few words in German, authorities said. He carried a Freetime Alpes 2 tent designed for two persons; an Outwell sleeping bag; a black-like new backpack of the Finnish brand Kaikkialla; and clean clothes, partly for winter, authorities said. The story has been compared to the ""Piano Man,"" who was found wandering aimlessly near a beach on the isle of Sheppey, Kent, in southern England in 2005. The man was wearing a waterlogged dinner suit with all its labels cut out and a tie. It initially was reported that he stunned witnesses with a ""virtuoso performance"" on the piano. The man was identified as a 20-year-old German national from Bavaria after telling staff at a hospital that he had been attempting suicide when found by police, the Times of London reported in August 2005. The man could not play the piano as well as initially reported, the newspaper said. The man, whom authorities did not identify because of confidentiality laws, flew back home to Germany, the Times said.

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal court challenge to a new Arizona law aimed at curbing illegal immigration isn't out of the question, Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday. Holder said that the Justice Department was working with the Department of Homeland Security to ""decide exactly how we are going to react to it."" ""We are considering all possibilities, including the possibility of a court challenge,"" Holder told reporters during questions at a news conference, at which he had announced a settlement with pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca over its marketing of an anti-psychotic drug. ""I think that [Arizona's] law is an unfortunate one,"" he said. ""I think that it is, I fear, subject to potential abuse. And I'm very concerned about the wedge that it could draw between communities that law enforcement is supposed to serve and those of us in law enforcement. "" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who served as Arizona's governor until she took the position with the Obama administration, told a Senate panel Tuesday that she has ""deep concerns"" with the law. Napolitano said she fears it would siphon away resources that would otherwise be used to pursue individuals who commit major crimes while in the country illegally. ""I think these kinds of laws are not value-added to law enforcement,"" she told the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""There's a reason most law enforcement groups ... oppose them."" They put an ""undue barrier"" between victims of crime and law enforcement officials, she said. Napolitano, who served as Arizona's governor before joining President Obama's Cabinet, refused to offer an opinion on the constitutionality of the law. The new law requires Arizona police to determine whether people are in the United States legally if there is a reason to suspect they aren't. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, signed the controversial legislation into law Friday. Supporters say it is needed to control illegal immigration. The law, scheduled to go into effect 90 days after the close of the state's legislative session, would require immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times. Currently, officers can check someone's immigration status only if that person is suspected in another crime. Critics say the law could foster racial profiling and prompt businesses, conventions and tourists to stay away from the state. The bill has prompted rallies by opponents and supporters, and some prominent politicians in Washington and Arizona have criticized the measure. Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, a Democrat, has said he'll file a lawsuit to block the law. Last week, Obama called the legislation ""misguided"" and said the federal government must act on the immigration issue. ""Our failure to act responsible at the federal level will only open the door to irresponsibility by others. That includes, for example, the recent efforts in Arizona, which threaten to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans, as well as the trust between police and their communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe,"" he said. Napolitano told the Judiciary Committee members that the ""passage of laws like [Arizona's] at the state level indicate the need to move forward with comprehensive immigration reform."" But Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, blamed federal authorities for undermining the push for comprehensive immigration reform by failing to more effectively secure the Mexican border. ""Our borders are broken ... [and] there's a war going on"" with drug cartels in Mexico that is spilling over into the United States, he argued. ""Good people are so afraid of an out-of-control border that they had to resort to a law [in Arizona] that I think is unconstitutional,"" he said. The federal government has to prove ""that we can secure our borders"" before Congress can pass an immigration reform bill. Over the weekend, Graham withdrew his support for what had been a bipartisan plan to pass climate change legislation because, he claimed, Democrats were trying to ram through a polarizing immigration reform bill. Some political observers have said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, is trying to push a reform plan in order to boost his standing among Hispanic voters and bolster his re-election prospects in November. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, acknowledged Tuesday that congressional Democrats are divided over how to proceed with an immigration reform bill. He also said House members are expecting the Senate to take the lead in crafting a proposal. ""In part, of course, what the people of Arizona are saying is that the feds haven't done their job. I think they're right,"" he said. But Hoyer criticized the new state law, arguing that it is ""very inconsistent with past practices in America. ... We don't go around asking people for I.D. cards."" He said it is ""very difficult to see how that's going to be carried out in a way that's consistent with the civil liberties of citizens."" Napolitano acknowledged that more work has to be done along the southern border, but she also expressed frustration with GOP arguments on border security. She claimed that the overall situation has improved and questioned whether the goal of ""securing the border"" could ever be fully reached. Napolitano declined to provide a direct answer when asked whether the Arizona law could negatively impact race relations. But ""if this law goes into effect,"" she warned, ""there are a lot of questions about what the real impact on the street will be.""

"Immigration champion Rep. Luis Gutierrez feels confident that President Barack Obama will use his executive powers to push through reform. House Speaker John Boehner feels confident that doing so will tank what little support the President has among Republicans on immigration reform. They're both right, immigration law experts say. After pushback from immigration activists and some members of his party, the President has directed his administration to reexamine its deportation policy. The administration could shift noncriminals and minor offenders to the lowest deportation priorities. ""I think the President has a difficult decision to make here,"" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor at Cornell University Law School. ""The courts have upheld wide discretion on immigration matters. He could make noncriminals the lowest deportation priorities. ... But there is a penalty he could pay through using executive action rather than waiting for Congress to act on immigration reform."" That political price, Boehner told Fox News last week, is ""that will make it almost impossible to ever do immigration reform, because he will spoil the well to the point where no one will trust him by giving him a new law that he will implement the way the Congress intended."" ""The American people want us to deal with immigration reform,"" Boehner said on Fox News' ""Kelly File"" during the same interview. ""But every time the President ignores the law, like the 38 times he has on Obamacare, our members look up and go, 'Wait a minute: You can't have immigration reform without strong border security and internal enforcement. How can we trust the President to actually obey the law and enforce the law that we would write?'"" Legislation stuck in the House . Last year, the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration reform package -- which includes a citizenship path for an estimated 8 million of the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Roughly one-third of that chamber's Republicans supported the measure, but the legislation has been stymied in the Republican-controlled House as lawmakers there hammer out more incremental approaches to such things as a path to legalization. Dems to Obama: Suspend deportations . In the meantime, Obama has faced increasing pressure from immigration activists and members of his own party to use the power of his pen to help stem the high number of deportations that have occurred during his administration. Under this President, there have been roughly 2 million deportations, a number that far exceeds that of previous administrations and led the head of the National Council of La Raza to dub him ""the deporter-in-chief."" There are things Obama could do right away, experts say. Currently, law enforcement agents along the border and those investigating national security matters can engage in ethnic or racial profiling. Federal agents elsewhere in the country can profile based on a person's religion, national origin, sexual orientation or gender identification if they suspect  immigration or national security laws have been broken. Obama could, through executive action, expand a ban on any kind of profiling, according to a report released Tuesday by the Brennan Center at New York University's School of Law, which would reduce the amount of people taken into custody and reduce deportations. ""This is something the President has known he could do since the beginning of his administration,"" said Faiza Patel, co-director of the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program. ""And I do think the renewed commitment to doing executive action should help push things forward."" The Justice Department is reviewing racial profiling in federal law enforcement, and the White House recently directed the Justice Department to include Homeland Security in its review. Why hasn't Obama acted on immigration? The President's apparent reluctance to use the power of his office to more heavily push immigration reform is a bit baffling, immigration and political analysts say. ""It's a mystery,"" said CNN senior political analyst David Gergen. ""He clearly cares, but he hasn't fought the issue. Public opinion is still malleable on this. ...This is an opportunity for the President to get back into this fight and embrace the Jeb Bush spirit,"" Gergen said of the former Florida governor's ""compassionate conservative"" approach to immigration, which includes understanding the impact of deportation on families. Obama said in November that he does not have the power to halt the record number of deportations that have occurred under his watch. But he does have some latitude in implementing such laws, immigration law experts say. Using prosecutorial discretion, the executive branch has the ""inherent power to choose which cases to act on,"" Richard A. Boswell, an immigration law professor at the University of California's Hastings College of the Law, told CNN. Obama said he can't stop deportations of immigrants, but maybe he can . Some prominent Democrats agree and point to his executive action in 2012 in halting the deportations of ""Dreamers,"" the children of undocumented immigrants dubbed for the DREAM Act, which would have provided amnesty for them. ""Mr. President, you do have the power to stop what's going on,"" Rep. Charles Rangel, D-New York, said at a news conference in December calling for an end to the deportations. Rangel and Gutierrez were among the 30 Democratic lawmakers who signed a letter telling the President that not only did he have the authority to halt the high number of deportations, but ""our efforts in Congress will only be helped by the sensible and moral step of stopping deportations."" Obama netted 71% of the Latino vote in the last election, while Republican nominee Mitt Romney garnered 27%. Hispanics are the fastest-growing minority group. GOP wants to expand appeal beyond its base . After the GOP's losses among African-Americans, women and Latinos, the party performed an autopsy of sorts and has since redoubled efforts to make better inroads with those groups. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi last week said race was part of the reason Republicans in that chamber are blocking immigration reform efforts. ""I think race has something to do with the fact that they're not bringing up an immigration bill,"" she said. However, despite the popularity the President enjoyed among Hispanics, a minority group that has been vocal about the record-high deportations, using executive action to do more on immigration reform could have negative political consequences, said Yale-Loehr, the Cornell University Law School professor. ""In the short term for Obama himself, it might not matter, but what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,"" Yale-Loehr said. ""If a Republican president made an executive action and used Obama as an example to say 'I could do what I want,' it could hurt Democrats."" Still, strong signals from the White House recently in directing Homeland Security to look into how it can apply immigration laws ""more humanely"" give members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and their constituents hope. Gutierrez took to the House floor recently to warn Republicans that when it comes to immigration, a day of reckoning is coming. ""If you refuse to give the President a bill he can sign because you do not trust him to enforce immigration laws ... he will act without you,"" Gutierrez, a Democrat who hails from the President's home state of Illinois, said on the House floor this month. ""He has alternatives under existing law. There are concrete ways within existing law to help keep families together and spare U.S. citizens from losing their wives, their husbands and their children to deportation. In spite of your lack of action,"" Gutierrez said. ""And I believe the President is going to use those tools.  I saw it in his eyes when I met with him.""","Activists, some Democrats want Obama to use executive action to stem deportations .

"(CNN) -- When Russia bid to host its first Winter Olympics back in 2007, the document quoted an expected cost of around $12 billion. However, as the extensive renovation of the city of Sochi has unfolded in the years since successfully winning the rights to stage the Games, that number has ballooned to around $50 billion -- more than four times over budget. It will be the most expensive Olympics yet, surpassing Beijing's 2008 Summer Games. The Russian government says that much of this has been sunk into infrastructure -- upgrading travel links such as airports and train stations, building new roads, houses, hotels and conference centers and providing the other necessary utilities to welcome thousands of visitors. According to both President Vladimir Putin and his predecessor, the present Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, the ""sports-related"" costs have come to about $6.4 billion. This has largely come from building 10 competition venues, both down on the Black Sea coast in Sochi's Olympic area and up in the mountain cluster in Krasnaya Polyana -- which not long ago had just one ski lift. The Games will launch with the February 7 opening ceremony at the $600 million Fisht Stadium, which will not host any sporting events but will close the Olympics two and a half weeks later. The arena will then be used by Russia's national football team and will host matches at the 2018 World Cup with an expanded capacity of 45,000.

"(CNN) -- If you get arrested in California, better hope there are no incriminating texts or e-mails or sensitive data stored on your phone. On Monday, the California Supreme Court ruled that police in that state can search the contents of an arrested person's cell phone. Citing U.S. Supreme Court precedents, the ruling contends that ""The loss of privacy upon arrest extends beyond the arrestee's body to include 'personal property ... immediately associated with the person of the arrestee' at the time of arrest."" Two justices (Kathryn Mickle Werdegar and Carlos Moreno) dissented from the majority opinion: ""In light of the vast data storage capacity of smartphones and similar devices, the privacy interests that the federal Constitution's Fourth Amendment was intended to protect would be better served by a rule that did not allow police to rummage at leisure through the wealth of personal and business information that can be carried on a mobile phone or handheld computer merely because the device was taken from an arrestee's person."" In a blog post, Ohio attorney Patrick Murphy summarized the California case that led to this ruling: . In 2007 a Ventura County Deputy Sheriff witnessed a drug deal involving a car driven by Gregory Diaz. Diaz and his passenger were immediately arrested, and six Ecstasy pills were seized. At the police station, Diaz's phone was confiscated. Diaz denied knowledge of or involvement in the drug deal. After Diaz was interviewed by police, Murphy writes, the deputy ""looked at the cell phone's text message folder and discovered a message that said '6 4 80' -- which in the deputy's experience meant 'Six pills of Ecstasy for $80.' Minutes later [the deputy] confronted Diaz with the text message, at which time the suspect admitted to participating in the sale of Ecstasy."" But this ruling is not limited to text messages. The ruling allows police in California to access any data stored on an arrestee's phone: photos, address book, Web browsing history, data stored in apps (including social media apps), voicemail messages, search history, chat logs, and more. Also, depending on the use of location-enabled services or apps that store data on the phone, the police might also be able to infer the arrestee's past whereabouts. What if access to your phone is locked with a security code or pattern? According to Catherine Crump of the American Civil Liberties Union, ""The police can ask you to unlock the phone -- which many people will do -- but they almost certainly cannot compel you to unlock your phone without the involvement of a judge,"" she said. Also, she noted that so far it's legally unresolved whether police can copy data from an arrestee's phone for future examination. Depending on who's getting arrested, and for what, warrantless searches of cell phone data could have wide-ranging potential to implicate not just the arrested person, but also to draw police attention to other people who might be involved (or merely associated) with the arrestee. That might sound reasonable for investigations involving street crime, but what about for people who are arrested during protests and demonstrations? Expect the California ruling to be challenged -- perhaps in the U.S. Supreme Court. The San Francisco Chronicle reports, ""This issue has divided other courts. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston of San Francisco ruled in May 2007 that police had violated drug defendants' rights by searching their cell phones after their arrests. ""The Ohio Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion in a December 2009 ruling in which the state unsuccessfully sought U.S. Supreme Court review. The Ohio-California split could prompt the nation's high court to take up the issue."" The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Police in California can now search contents of arrested person's cell phone .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Chamber of Commerce is launching an ad featuring Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a favorite of libertarians, to build support for Alaska Republican Senate hopeful Dan Sullivan, who faces a challenge from libertarian third party candidate. Republicans and their allies have begun work to limit how much support third party candidates draw away from GOP candidates in states which could determine control of the Senate. In the ad Paul uses language libertarians would like to tout Sullivan, who is locked in a tight race against first term Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Begich. Mark Fish, past chairman of the state's libertarian party, is running as well and is the wild card there because drawing even a small amount of votes away from Sullivan could prove the difference in this key race. ""Washington is horribly broken. I am Rand Paul, and I am fighting to change that.

""Washington takes too many of our freedoms and too much of our money. I think Dan Sullivan will get it back. To change Washington change your Senator.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday firmly rejected President Barack Obama's call for an approximate return to the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war, telling the U.S. leader that such a move is impossible in light of current security concerns and demographic realities. The two leaders pledged to work together, however, in the pursuit of a comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. ""Israel wants peace. I want peace,"" Netanyahu said while meeting with Obama at the White House. But ""a peace based on illusions will crash eventually on the rocks of Middle Eastern reality,"" he said. ""Obviously there are some differences between us in the precise formulations and language, and that's going to happen between friends,"" Obama said. ""But what we are in complete accord about is that a true peace can only occur if the ultimate resolution allows Israel to defend itself against threats, and that Israel's security will remain paramount in U.S. evaluations of any prospective peace deal."" Both men stressed that the presence of the militant group Hamas in a Palestinian government would be extremely problematic for future peace talks. The United States and Israel consider Hamas a terrorist group. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas ""has to decide if he negotiates or keeps his pact with Hamas, or makes peace with Israel,"" Netanyahu said. ""I hope he makes the choice -- the right choice -- in choosing peace with Israel."" But Abbas' spokesman said it was Netanyahu who was derailing the peace process. ""These statements are an official declaration that he is not ready for true peace based on justice and international resolutions,"" presidential spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh told the WAFA news agency. Abu Rudeineh said the Palestinian government independent and has ""nothing to do with Fatah or Hamas. What Netanyahu is saying are excuses to avoid sitting at the negotiating table,"" he said. Obama's call Thursday for an approximate return to the 1967 borders, which made official a long-held but rarely stated U.S. position, has increased tension between the two longstanding allies at a moment of turbulent change in the Arab world. Israel seized the West Bank, Gaza, Golan Heights and Sinai Peninsula during the 1967 war. The Sinai has since been returned to Egypt. Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981, a move not recognized by the international community and condemned by Syria, which still claims the land. Hamas now controls Gaza, while the more moderate Palestinian group Fatah administers the West Bank, site of a growing number of Israeli settlements. Ultimately, the Palestinians are aiming to unite Gaza and the West Bank under the authority of a new state. The Israeli government has repeatedly said, among other things, that peace talks with the Palestinians cannot seriously proceed without firmer security guarantees and a clear recognition of the Jewish state's right to exist. Obama said Thursday that the borders of Israel and a Palestinian state ""should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps, so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states."" His position largely agreed with the Palestinian negotiating stance on border issues in the staggering peace process, now stalled by disputes over Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the role of Hamas in the Palestinian leadership. At the same time, Obama reiterated unwavering U.S. support for Israel's security Thursday, and he endorsed certain negotiating positions of Netanyahu's government, including an incremental handover of security responsibilities by Israel when conditions on the ground allow it. He also said a future Palestinian state would have to remain ""nonmilitarized."" Obama sought to undercut momentum for a declaration of Palestinian statehood at the United Nations in September, warning that ""symbolic actions to isolate Israel (at the U.N.) won't create an independent state."" The president said he recognizes that two ""wrenching and emotional issues"" remain unresolved: the future status of Jerusalem, which is claimed by both sides, and the fate of Palestinian refugees who claim Israel as their homeland. Netanyahu, considered hawkish on security matters, reacted coolly to the president's speech. He has argued that the 1967 borders are now ""indefensible"" for Israel, and noted that major population centers are located beyond those lines. Hamas also rejected the terms outlined in the speech, calling them ""empty of concrete significance."" Israel, meanwhile, announced the approval Thursday of new projects to build 1,500 housing units in Har Homa and Pisgat Zeev, which are outside the 1967 borders. The projects had previously received initial approval, said Roye Lackmanovich, an Interior Ministry spokesman. Israeli officials said before Friday's meeting that Netanyahu intended to use the occasion not only to stress his opposition to a restoration of the 1967 lines, but also to seek specifics on the type of security guarantees envisioned by the president, including the assertion that a Palestinian state would remain nonmilitarized. Netanyahu also wanted Obama to clarify his stance on both Hamas and the so-called ""right of return"" for Palestinian families who left Israel after the state's founding in 1948. Israel has repeatedly warned that it cannot allow those families to return without sacrificing its identity as a Jewish state. Netanyahu made clear after Friday's meeting that the families of the 1948 refugees cannot settle within Israel's borders. While Netanyahu and other conservative members of the Israeli government have been critical of Obama in the wake of Thursday's speech, the president also has defenders within the Knesset, Israel's parliament. Tzipi Livni, an opposition leader and former foreign minister, applauded Obama's call for a two-state solution. ""An American president that supports a two-state solution represents the Israeli interest and is not anti-Israeli,"" Livni said. ""President Obama's call to start negotiations represents Israel's interests."" Also, the group known as the Middle East Quartet -- which includes the United Nations, Russia, the European Union and the United States -- issued a statement Friday offering its ""strong support"" for Obama's ""vision of Israeli-Palestinian peace."" The White House has been heavily focused on Middle East issues this week. Obama met with Jordan's King Abdullah II on Tuesday and will address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, an influential pro-Israel lobbying group, on Sunday. CNN's Elise Labott, Kevin Flower and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejects a return to the 1967 borders .

"Noah Galloway's daily workouts could intimidate the most seasoned athlete. He runs, climbs, does pull-ups and push-ups, and lifts weights for nearly two hours at a time. But what really sets this 30-year-old father of three apart is that he does it all with one arm and one leg. In the aftermath of September 11, Galloway felt called to serve his country. At 19, he withdrew from the University of Alabama at Birmingham and enlisted in the United States Army. ""After we were attacked, I felt like it was what I needed to do. I quit school and started off on a new journey."" Galloway was deployed to Iraq with the 101st Airborne out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky, in 2003. After becoming a husband and father, he returned for a second tour in 2005. ""They put us in an area that was known as the triangle of death. It was southwest of Baghdad. The units that had been there before us had taken a beating. It was just a rough area."" Four months into his second deployment, he was trying to catch a bit of sleep between missions when his platoon leader woke him. ""He said, 'Hey, we're gonna go take these Humvees to go pick up the rest of the platoon.' Said there's nothing important going on.  We're just going to pick them up, coming back. Just wanted you to know we're leaving."" But Galloway says he insisted on not only joining the convoy but driving the lead vehicle, a decision that put him in the path of a roadside bomb detonated by a trip wire. Four days later, on Christmas morning, Galloway woke in Walter Reed Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. ""I had no idea where I was or how I got there. I remember waking up and seeing my parents walking in. I knew I was somewhere safe because they were there, and something told me to smile because they'd know I was OK."" He lost his left arm above the elbow and left leg above the knee. His jaw needed to be reconstructed, and his mouth was wired shut. His recovery was as rough emotionally as it was physically, and during it he and his wife divorced. ""I remember thinking it was all over. I was very physical. I'd lost two limbs, a wife. You know, I remember thinking I much rather had died than wake up like this,"" Galloway said. His attitude started to shift thanks, in part, to a fellow amputee: his father, who lost his hand at age 18 when a machine malfunction at the plant where he worked. ""I remember there was a moment that my mom leaned in and told me while I laid in the hospital bed, and she said, 'You just had to outdo your dad and lose your arm and your leg,' and it was that moment that I thought, 'you know, this is bad, but it could be worse. Maybe I can do something with this.' "" Galloway moved back home to Alabama, remarried and had two more children. He then decided it was time he got back into shape. He found Combat Fitness Training Facility in Birmingham. The gym is owned by Army veteran who designs military-inspired workouts that Galloway thrives on. ""He's shown great drive, and basically the goals that he sets, every time he achieves one, he sets a higher one,"" Combat Fitness owner Sean Dickson said. Galloway continues to push himself harder and now competes in grueling races like the Warrior Dash and Tough Mudder, in which runners tackle an obstacle course. He is also training to run the Marine Corps Marathon in October. He has documented his journey through social media and garnered a legion of supporters with his story. ""People started following me in what I was doing, sending me messages and telling me how I motivated them. Some were people with disabilities. Some were not,"" Galloway said. ""I never intended that to happen. I was just doing something for myself."" Seeing his recovery as an opportunity to motivate others, he joined Team X-T.R.E.M.E. The nonprofit enlists people to participate in physically demanding races wearing gas masks. The proceeds are used to take injured veterans on morale-boosting trips. ""It's not that I'm this incredible guy, but my injury was before them. And if I can show them the route I took to success, then they can follow the same, and that makes me feel good."" Galloway is passionate about leading other veterans to recovery and showing them what they can do instead of what they can't, but the most important people he hopes to inspire are much closer to home. ""I'm showing my two sons and my daughter that no matter what happens to you in life, you can continue pushing. You can continue to be happy and do whatever you want to do. I feel like I'm showing them what they need to do, because as a parent, you can try to preach to your children all day long. They don't hear your words. They only see your actions. And I hope that I'm showing them a healthy, happy way of leading their life.""","Noah Galloway served two tours of duty in Iraq with the U.S. Army .

"Iraq's prime minister, facing an insurgent al Qaeda affiliate and sectarian strife, will appeal to President Barack Obama on Friday for new assistance from the United States, even as some lawmakers question Nuri al-Maliki's ability to lead his nation. A fresh rise in suicide bombers affiliated with al Qaeda has left more than 6,000 people dead this year alone, according to United Nations estimates. Violence has been on the upswing: On Wednesday, a suicide bomber killed at least nine people and wounded 25 others at a police checkpoint west of Mosul. Al-Maliki is expected to ask for assistance in the form of weapons, equipment and intelligence-sharing in a bid to quell the bloodshed, two years after the United States withdrew almost all its troops from Iraq after Baghdad refused to renew a security agreement to extend legal immunity for American forces. A bipartisan group of senators harshly criticized al-Maliki in a letter to Obama on Tuesday. They wrote that the recent security deterioration in Iraq was partially the Prime Minister's fault, citing what they cast as an exclusionary government. ""Unfortunately, Prime Minister Maliki's mismanagement of Iraqi politics is contributing to the recent surge of violence,"" the senators wrote. Signatories included Republicans John McCain, James Inhofe and Bob Corker and Democrats Carl Levin and Robert Menendez. ""By too often pursuing a sectarian and authoritarian agenda, Prime Minister Maliki and his allies are disenfranchising Sunni Iraqis, marginalizing Kurdish Iraqis, and alienating the many Shia Iraqis who have a democratic, inclusive, and pluralistic vision for their country,"" the lawmakers continued. Al-Maliki and Iraqi officials met with Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday and Thursday in Washington, where they discussed the current threats. On Thursday, the Iraqi prime minister said in a speech that he was looking for greater support from the United States in ending the violence in his nation. ""We are talking with the Americans. We are telling them we need to benefit from their experience, from the intelligence information, from training for those who are targeting al Qaeda in a developed, technical, scientific way,"" he said at the United States Institute of Peace. On Friday, Obama and al-Maliki will continue to hash out ways for Iraq to better counter fighters associated with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, an al Qaeda-affiliated group whose leader is thought to be based in war-torn Syria. That effort could include some equipment and weapons sales, and the sharing of intelligence, according to a senior U.S. administration official, who said Iraq's current resources don't allow the nation to effectively target al Qaeda insurgents in the western part of the country. ""What we don't want the Iraqis to do is just take a security-centric approach to this,"" the official said. ""What that means is making sure they have information in terms of where people are located, where it's coming from, where the funding is coming from, and that's something we can do pretty effectively,"" the official continued. ""So we're trying to help them now as best we can, and that's going to be a key topic of discussion over the course of the visit."" The U.S. supports separate weapons and air defense systems in Iraq, and a delivery of U.S. F-16 fighter jets is still planned for next fall, the official said, noting that Iraq had just submitted a deposit of more than $600 million after signing a contract last year for them. U.S. officials are also asking Iraq to do more to end Iranian shipments to Syria's regime that utilize Iraqi airspace, a request originally made by Secretary of State John Kerry seven months ago during a surprise visit to Baghdad. ""We'd like them to do more,"" the official said of Iraq's progress on ending the over-flights from Iran.","Nuri al-Maliki expected to ask for assistance like weapons, intelligence-sharing .

"The Justice Department filed a lawsuit Monday seeking to block parts of a new North Carolina voting law that tightens election procedures, including requiring photo identification to cast ballots. Justice Department officials said the North Carolina law is discriminatory in intent and effect. The suit challenges four parts of the law and asks a court to require North Carolina to obtain pre-approval for certain voting law changes under a part of the Voting Rights Act that remains in effect. The lawsuit is part of Attorney General Eric Holder's response to a June Supreme Court ruling that struck down a Voting Rights Act requirement for a patchwork of states and local jurisdictions to get permission from the Justice Department or a federal judge before enacting voting law changes. North Carolina lawmakers approve controversial election changes . The four sections in dispute are: the requirement of photo ID to cast ballots; the shortening of early voting from 17 days to 10; the elimination of same-day voter registration during early voting; and restrictions on counting some provisional ballots. The photo ID portion of the North Carolina law was the center of controversy because Democrats said that it didn't include protections for voters who don't have identification and that it disproportionately would affect minority voters. Conservatives have pushed such photo ID requirements in many states, saying they would prevent vote fraud. Studies of recent elections have shown in-person vote fraud to be rare. Some voter photo ID laws have been upheld by the courts. In August, the Justice Department filed similar lawsuits against Texas seeking to block the state's 2011 election redistricting plan and a new voter photo ID law. The federal government is also seeking to require Texas to seek future pre-approval for voting law changes. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory signed the voting law changes last month. McCrory's office issued a statement on Monday with a link to a video showing President Barack Obama being asked for and presenting his driver's license at an Illinois polling station before voting in the 2012 presidential election. ""I believe if showing a voter ID is good enough and fair enough for our own president in Illinois, then it's good enough for the people in North Carolina,"" McCrory said. He said North Carolina is in line with a majority of states with voter ID laws, and said voters without identification will be able to get free identification cards from the state in January. ""Protecting the integrity of every vote is one of the most important duties I have as governor of this great state. And that is why I signed this common sense legislation into law,"" McCrory said. In a speech earlier this month at a convention of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, Holder repeated his criticism of the June high court ruling on the Voting Rights Act, calling it ""a deeply flawed decision that effectively invalidated a cornerstone of American civil rights law."" He said despite the ruling, the Justice Department would find ways to try to accomplish the goals of the section of the law that was struck down. ""We will continue to vigorously enforce federal voting laws not affected by the Supreme Court's decision -- including all remaining parts of the Voting Rights Act,"" Holder said. The Supreme Court called the pre-clearance portion of the law unconstitutional in part because of its disparate treatment of the affected states. The ruling left standing other portions of the 1965 law, which was reauthorized by Congress and signed by President George W. Bush in 2006.

"(CNN) -- Tuesday's space debris incident at the International Space Station was the ""closest anything has come to the space station,"" NASA said Wednesday. Final calculations showed the unknown object passed the space station 1,100 feet away and its source remains a mystery, according to Kelly Humphries, a spokesman at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. When the unexpected space debris came flying close to the space station Tuesday, it prompted the station's six astronauts to take shelter inside two Soyuz capsules, NASA said. NASA does not expect any other close calls with this particular debris, said Humphries. Russia's Interfax news agency said preliminary data on ""the dangerous approach"" shows that the ""trash"" came within about 250 meters (820 feet) of the station. Officials at NASA are investigating what the debris was, NASA spokesman Joshua Buck said. By the time it was spotted, it was ""too late to make an avoidance maneuver,"" so NASA ordered the six crew members to ""shelter in place,"" Buck said. About 7:30 a.m. ET, the crew members climbed into the two Soyuz capsules positioned at the station. NASA determined that the debris would come closest to the station at 8:08 a.m. ET. Three minutes later, at 8:11 a.m. ET, the all-clear was sounded and astronauts were allowed to exit the capsules, Buck said. Buck described the debris as an ""unknown object of unknown size.""

"(CNN) -- Iranian authorities have released an American-born graduate student on bail after holding her in prison for nearly a month, an Amnesty International spokeswoman said Tuesday. Graduate student Esha Momeni was arrested last month in Iran and jailed after an alleged traffic violation. Esha Momeni, 28, had been working on a project on the women's movement in Iran when she was arrested October 15 for an alleged traffic violation, according to California State University-Northridge and Change For Equality, an Iranian women's movement. She had been held in solitary confinement in Tehran's notorious Evin Prison, Change For Equality said. ""We're really happy she's been released on bail,"" Elise Auerbach of Amnesty International said Tuesday. She said she learned of Momeni's release Monday through Amnesty's researchers in London, England, and from Momeni's family and friends. Melissa Wall, a journalism professor at the university and an academic adviser to Momeni, confirmed the young woman's release in an e-mail. Wall said they were waiting to see what will ""happen next in terms of charges or conditions or sentencing."" The university will hold a rally and vigil Wednesday calling for Momeni's return to California, she said. The event had been planned before Momeni's release. Auerbach, the Iran specialist for Amnesty International USA, said she did not know the exact bail amount, only that Momeni's parents had handed over the deed to their home in Iran in return for their daughter's release. ""This is a real problem for her family because the state of their home is in doubt,"" Auerbach said, adding that if the Iranian government determines Momeni has violated the bail conditions, it can take her family's home. Auerbach said Momeni has not been charged, ""but there is some indication that they're planning on charging her."" Tehran's deputy general prosecutor, Hasan Hadad, has ""deliberately leaked"" to the state-run media his intentions to charge Momeni with propaganda against the state, Auerbach said. The Iranian judiciary has not commented on Momeni's release. ""A lot of people have faced that charge,"" Auerbach said. ""It's kind of a vague, loosely worded charge that's kind of convenient. They can use it against whomever they want basically."" Auerbach said Momeni is not the only woman involved with Change for Equality who has been jailed recently; at least three women who worked with the group are being detained, she said. Ronak Safarzadeh was arrested in October 2007 and charged with enmity with God, a charge akin to treason, and is being held in Sanandaj Prison; Hana Abdi, 21, recently was sentenced to 18 months at Sanandaj for gathering and colluding to commit a crime against national security; and Zeynab Beyezidi, 26, was sentenced in August to four years at Mahabad Central Prison for belonging to an illegal group, the Human Rights Organization of Kurdistan, Auerbach said. As of Tuesday morning, the Iranian government had not returned Momeni's passport and travel papers, Auerbach said, adding that ""there is a pattern that after people are released from detention they are still kept in Iran."" Among the examples, Auerbach said, are Haleh Esfandiari, an Iranian-American scholar with the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, and Mehrnoushe Solouki, a French-Iranian journalism student at the University of Quebec. Esfandiari, 67, was arrested in 2007 while visiting her ailing mother in Iran. She was charged with harming national security and held for 105 days in Evin Prison. She was released August 21, 2007, after her mother posted $330,000 bail, but did not leave Iran until September 2, 2007. Solouki was arrested in February 2007 and accused of ""trying to make a propaganda film,"" according to Reporters Without Borders. She was released from Evin Prison the following month after her parents' house was offered as bail, but Solouki was not allowed to leave Iran until January, the group reported. Momeni's father, Gholamreza Momeni, initially condemned his daughter's arrest, saying that even if she confessed to a crime, ""anything my daughter may say in solitary confinement is worthless,"" according to roozonline.com, a news Web site run by exiled Iranian journalists. The father gave a different account to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency last week, however, and said he was angry that his daughter had engaged in ""illegal activities."" ""I got so angry that I and her mother decided not visit her,"" he told IRNA on Friday. ""I deny all that has been attributed to me by Web sites and believe them to be the personal interpretations of the reporters."" He added, ""As an Iranian, I love my country and do not wish any harm to the Islamic republic."" Hadi Ghaemi, coordinator for the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, said it was not clear under what circumstances Momeni's father talked to IRNA, but the remarks seem ""very suspect."" ""It really doesn't make any sense for him to make a verdict on his daughter's guilt,"" Ghaemi said Saturday, the day after the IRNA report was published. CNN could not reach Gholamreza Momeni for comment Tuesday. Since Momeni's arrest became public, Amnesty International, other human rights organizations and her university have called for her immediate release. ""We have concern for this young person because, like many young people, she is a dreamer, she's a thinker, she's a researcher,"" university Provost Harry Hellenbrand said last month. Momeni ""has the best interests of young people and women in her mind,"" he said. The Los Angeles-born graduate student had been filming footage for a project on the women's rights movement, and interviewing volunteers for the One Million Signature campaign, launched in 2006 by Change for Equality. The campaign seeks to collect signatures on a petition demanding that Iran rewrite its constitution to recognize men and women as equal. According to the CSU-Northridge newspaper, the Daily Sundial, fellow graduate student Peyman Malaz said Momeni was ""determined to better the lives of Iranian citizens."" Nayereh Tohidi, chairwoman of the school's gender and women's studies department, told the paper she, too, was involved in the campaign and had advised Momeni on her work. ""She has not been a part of any political parties, any clandestine movements,"" Tohidi said. ""She has done nothing wrong."" Ghaemi said he believes Tehran wants to stifle the women's rights movement, and Momeni's arrest was meant to intimidate like-minded scholars or activists. ""We see here detention as a method of pressuring that movement on a broader scale,"" he said. ""The government would very much like to quiet these women."" CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","Amnesty: Esha Momeni's parents gave Iranian government deed to their house .

"When 33 Chilean miners were trapped underground in 2010, the government sent GoPro cameras 2,300 feet down to film the group and their eventual rescue. Felix Baumgartner had a GoPro camera strapped to his chest when he skydived a record 24 miles on October 14. Cinematographer Andy Casagrande mounted a GoPro onto the back of a great white shark and another in a fake seal to film inside a shark's mouth. But the small, wearable video cameras are also being used to document less dramatic events, like babies being cute, cross-country road trips and the Internet's favorite video subject, cats. The dizzying variety of places GoPro cameras have gone shows how the product has grown from a niche tool for surfers into to the rugged video camera of choice for recording physical, outdoor, dangerous or first-person footage. GoPro has found a unique place in the camera market by focusing intensely on its main product: a tiny wearable waterproof and shockproof HD camera that can be mounted almost anywhere. The newest version of the device is the HD Hero3, announced this week, which is 30% smaller than its predecessors. The new models record higher-quality HD video (up to 4Kp), still images and audio, and cost between $200 and $400. The company was started by surfer Nick Woodman in 2002, taking off with its first HD camera offering in 2009. Woodman has managed to break into a market dominated by big names with long histories such as Canon, Nikon, Sony, Fuji and Olympus. With the camera market split into two main categories -- high-end digital SLRs and camera phones -- GoPro is carving out a third category: high-definition action. Part of the company's success stems from its unique approach to marketing. Like its founder, many of the company's 300-plus employees embody the adventurous GoPro brand and live the lifestyle. They're surfers and skydivers, DIY tinkerers and video geeks. The company has a tight relationship with its customers, constantly finding and featuring cool videos it finds on YouTube or Vimeo that were shot with a GoPro. The media team puts the cameras in the hands of big-name athletes such as Shaun White and Kelly Slater and takes part in large events like the Baumgartner jump and the X Games. Luckily for GoPro, its cameras are natural viral video stars and apparently look delicious to seagulls: A seagull in France grabbed a GoPro and dropped if off on top of a castle, and another in San Francisco took one for a ride over the bay at sunset. The two bird videos alone have racked up over 5 million views in total. A video shot on a GoPro of a mountain biker being taken out by a gazelle has more than 14 million views. Other companies shell out huge amounts of money for that level of exposure. Bradford Schmitt, GoPro's creative director of media production, encapsulates the spirit of the company. He looks and acts the part of an adrenaline-loving California dude, rocking tattered T-shirts, sun-bleached blond hair and a scraggly beard. Schmitt met Woodman and his wife, Jill, in 2002 on a trip in the Mentawai Islands, off the coast of Sumatra in Indonesia. The group instantly connected and began traveling together. Schmitt and Woodman were fixated on finding the best way to record their surfing exploits without a professional photographer, eventually trying to attach a 35mm waterproof film camera to a wrist strap fashioned out of an old surfboard leash and rubber bands. Woodman and his wife brought a couple thousand bean-shell belts back to California from Indonesia and sold them out of their Volkswagen van for cash. All the while, Woodman was experimenting with the camera, sending the first prototype to Schmitt in 2004 to test while he traveled around the world. Working with existing camera companies to license their hardware for a wrist strap turned out to be difficult, so Woodman went to China and commissioned a cheap camera in a waterproof case. He established a proper company called Woodman Labs, hired employees, hit the trade shows and even went on QVC. In November 2009, GoPro released its first HD camera. It's since sold more than 3 million HD cameras. GoPro isn't a typical Silicon Valley technology company. It makes hardware, it's been profitable from early on, and not including some original funding from friends and family, it has taken on only modest amounts of outside investment -- including an undisclosed sum from the Disney-affiliated Steamboat Ventures last year. What it does has in common with its software-making neighbors is the hacker spirit. GoPro employees and users are constantly tinkering with and modifying the camera, inventing mounts and unexpected uses. At the company's San Mateo headquarters, engineers and designers regularly create inventive mounts, only a handful of which every actually make it to production. GoPro customer and fisherman Mark Peters created a custom torpedo-shaped housing for his camera and dragged it behind a boat, catching amazing underwater video of dolphins. The camera has broken out of the sports world thanks in large part to these creative customers who are constantly coming up with new ""Wouldn't it be cool if ..."" scenarios. Scientists and companies have found that the camera also has practical uses, like collecting data. There were multiple cameras strapped to the 72-foot America's Cup boat that capsized and was dragged out through the Golden Gate into the ocean on Tuesday night. The racing team had been using the cameras to collect data for training. (Unfortunately, the damage to the multimillion-dollar boat was extensive, and the cameras were lost at sea.) A plasma-based rocket company has placed GoPros in a thermo-vacuum chamber for analysis when it fires test rockets. Meteorologists have sent the devices up on weather balloons, and oceanographers have sent them out to sea. The U.S. military uses GoPros and the optional night vision mounts. For the launch of its newest HD camera, the company is pushing harder to reach a more general audience, with television commercials, print ads and sponsorships. It organized an elaborate day of extreme activities in San Francisco for journalists, including rides in fighter jets, in race cars and on the back of America's Cup racing boats. It sent people up hot air balloons, on the back of motorcycles and scuba diving with sharks at the Aquarium of the Bay. GoPro has some competition from companies like Sony and will probably see more similar products on shelves as bigger camera companies try to duplicate its success. For now, it is enjoying showing off its new hardware and the rad HD videos it captures, whether they're of cats or fighter planes.","GoPro announced a new, smaller wearable camera that shoots up to 4Kp video .

"An Iranian-American who pleaded guilty to participating in a plot to kill the Saudi ambassador to the United States was sentenced Thursday to 25 years in prison. Attorneys for Manssor Arbabsiar, 58, wanted a 10-year sentence, but U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan agreed with the prosecution's recommendation of 25 years. Prosecutors said Arbabsiar tried to recruit a Mexican drug cartel to bomb a Washington restaurant where Saudi Ambassador Adel Al-Jubeir dined. But the scheme unraveled when Arbabsiar's cartel contact turned out to be an undercover agent. Terror cases since 9/11 . The judge noted that when Arbabsiar was told there would likely be a lot of casualties in the assassination plot, Arbabsiar said, ""No problem. No big deal."" Keenan said that others who may wish to conspire to cause harm to the United States or its interests ""must learn the lesson this will not be tolerated."" ""In a case like this, deterrence is of extreme importance,"" the judge said. Arrested in September 2011, Arbabsiar pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan in October and admitted to conspiring with members of the Iranian military in the formulation of the plot. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said earlier that the plot had been endorsed by parts of the Iranian government, but Iran has denied any involvement. Arbabsiar met ""on a number of occasions in Mexico with a Drug Enforcement Administration confidential source,"" officials said in a federal complaint. Posing as an associate of a sophisticated and violent international drug cartel, the source was hired by Arbabsiar and his cohorts to assassinate the ambassador, the complaint said. Before sentencing, Arbabsiar apologized and took responsibility for actions he said he knew were wrong. ""I can't change what I did, but I have a good heart. I never hurt anyone. My mind is sometimes not in a good place,"" he said. The defense request for a 10-year sentence was based, among other things, on the idea that Arbabsiar's crime was a result of untreated bipolar disorder, as argued by the defense's psychiatrist, Dr. Michael B. First, a Columbia University professor of clinical psychiatry. But Keenan said he thought the state's psychiatrist, Dr. Gregory B. Saathoff, made the point that Arbabsiar did not have serious mental illness, and his mental state should have no effect on sentencing.  Arbabsiar's age was not a factor in the sentencing because of the nature of the crime, Keenan said. Arbabsiar's public defender, Sabrina Shroff, asked the judge if Arbabsiar could be incarcerated in a facility as close as possible to Texas, where he lived before he was arrested. Keenan said he had no objection.","Judge says would-be conspirators ""must learn the lesson this will not be tolerated""

"The blindfolded prisoners are brought into the dank gray room, one by one, and begin to tell us their stories. We're in a prison run by Kurdish militants here in northern Syria. The Kurds won't allow us to see the cells where the prisoners are being held.  Their prisoners, they say, are members of ISIS. When the first detainee sits down, I ask the guard to please remove his blindfold.  He blinks in the bright light and clearly looks surprised to see a foreigner sitting in front of him. The second prisoner who arrives trembled with fear when he was brought in.  I introduce myself to each detainee as an American journalist. ""You don't have to talk if you don't feel comfortable,"" I add.  Each man speaks, though some cast darting glances at the prison guards who watch each interview. A man named Suleiman says he's from Syria, and claims that he was forced to join ISIS out of fears for his family's safety. He says he never traveled to ISIS-controlled territory, but confesses to being part of an ISIS cell that planted and detonated a remote control car bomb outside a Kurdish base in this Kurdish enclave. He believes the bomb killed his own nephew -- and says he received about $3,600 for the job. ""They said they were fighting for Islam and justice,"" Suleiman tells us. ""They were lying to us. They took advantage of our minds and our poverty."" Read more: Everything you need to know about ISIS . ISIS has seized huge chunks of Syria and Iraq in recent months, beheading Western journalists and nonbelievers as it strives to establish an independent ""Islamic State"" in the region. The terror group has been locked in a battle with Kurdish forces in the northern Syrian border town of Kobani since mid-September. The United States and its allies are bombing ISIS positions there, but airstrikes have yet to pry Kobani from the group's hands. Read more: Former U.S. soldier battles ISIS . The next prisoner the guards bring out is barely a man. His name is Kareem, and he says he's 19 years old. Kareem tells me he was paid $2,000 to fight alongside ISIS on the Syrian frontlines for more than a year -- and he has the battle scars to prove it. Lifting up his shirt, he reveals a gruesome pink and brown scar on his stomach. ""I was shot in the stomach three times,"" he says.  He also has ugly scars on his right arm from another bullet wound.  He claims ISIS drugged fighters before they went into battle. ""They gave us drugs,"" Kareem says. ""Hallucinogenic pills that would make you go to battle not caring if you live or die."" Kareem says he fought for a year all across ISIS-controlled territory.  He says other fighters he was with were promised wives by ISIS.  Most of the fighters were foreigners, he says, and he had difficulty communicating with them because they didn't speak the local Syrian dialect of Arabic. Kareem says he even met a fighter from China at one point. Before his capture by the Kurds, Kareem claims he saw ISIS behead many of its prisoners. ""Whenever ISIS goes into an area ... the people there who don't adhere to their Islamic law are apostates,"" he says. ""Everything has to follow ISIS' way. Even women who don't cover their faces ... women would get their heads chopped off."" The final prisoner was Jaber, a former teacher and father of two who also confessed to a car bombing. I ask Jaber what he would have done if he'd found me while he was on patrol with ISIS. ""Your fate would be death,"" he tells me. ""And there are different kinds of death -- they would torture you for sure, they might decapitate you, or cut off your hands. They will not simply shoot a bullet in your head."" Read more: Hostage claims Kobani is in ISIS' hands . When we finished speaking, a guard draped Jaber's blindfold back around his head and led him out of the room. It's impossible for CNN to confirm whether anything the prisoners told us was true -- or whether these men had merely been coached on what to say by their captors. They also appeared to have little information about what was going on in the outside world. One of the men, Suleiman, looks shocked when I tell him that a U.S.-led coalition that includes Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is conducting an aerial campaign bombarding ISIS targets. ""I hope they kill all of them,"" Suleiman says, with what appear to be tears welling in his eyes. All three men say it was a mistake to join ISIS. And they are begging their Kurdish captors for forgiveness. But the Kurdish guards running this prison say that if set free, every one of these men would likely go back and rejoin ISIS.","CNN's Ivan Watson speaks to ISIS fighters being held by Kurds in northern Syrian prison .

"Iceland is working on banning Internet pornography, calling explicit online images a threat to children. '""There is a strong consensus building in Iceland,"" Halla Gunnarsdottir, an adviser to the nation's Interior Minister, told England's Daily Mail. ""We have so many experts, from educationalists to the police and those who work with children behind this, that this has become much broader than party politics. ""At the moment, we are looking at the best technical ways to achieve this. But surely if we can send a man to the moon, we must be able to tackle porn on the Internet."" Such a step is somewhat surprising among Western nations that, for the most part, champion free-speech rights. But the move wouldn't be unprecedented in the island nation. Iceland has had laws banning the printing and distribution of pornography for years, but those laws haven't been updated to include the Web. And two years ago, the nation's parliament banned strip clubs, saying they violate the rights of the women who work in them. Iceland would become the first Western democracy to try and block pornography online. Interior Minister Ogmundur Jonasson has appointed committees to study the best methods for keeping young people from seeing explicit images and videos on computers, game consoles and smartphones. The options being considered, according to the Daily Mail, include blocking the IP addresses of known porn sites and making it illegal to use credit cards from Iceland to subscribe to X-rated sites. ""This move is not anti-sex. It is anti-violence because young children are seeing porn and acting it out,"" Gunnarsdottir said. ""That is where we draw the line. This material is blurring the boundaries for young people about what is right and wrong."" Attempting a total block of porn sites somewhere like the United States, with its legions of public and private portals onto the Web and the millions of software engineers who likely would spring into action to find workarounds, would be nearly impossible. But Iceland has a population of 322,000 -- roughly the same as St. Louis, Missouri. That, and its remote location 1,300 miles off of the coast of Europe, would make jamming or blocking Web traffic to certain sites easier, if that was the route the government there chose. The move is, predictably, drawing fire from Web-freedom advocates, including some in Iceland who agree with Jonasson on most issues. ""Since he claimed office as minister, Jonasson has brought forward progressive legislation and has shown that he can be a man of principles and courage. For that, I truly respect him,"" Birgitta Jonsdottir, a member of Iceland's parliament who represents part of Reykjavik, wrote in an editorial for London's The Guardian. ""But he is way off track in his attempts to place a shield around Iceland in order to 'stop porn' from entering the country."" A member of the parliament committee studying the issue, Jonsdottir says a porn ban has ""near zero"" chance of passing parliament and that she's working to find other ways the government can help protect children from Web porn. ""Introducing censorship without compromising freedom of expression and speech is like trying to mix oil and water: It is impossible,"" she wrote. ""I know my fellow MPs can often turn strange and dangerous laws into reality, but this won't be one of them.""","Iceland is studying ways to ban Internet porn .

"With a ruined centuries-old castle looming up on the hill above, the Slovakian village of Cachtice could easily take a starring role in a Gothic horror film. However, exactly 400 years ago, on August 21, the horror was all too real, as the life of the most prolific female mass murderer of all time -- a noblewoman by the name of Countess Elizabeth Bathory -- came to a grim end. It's not an anniversary they're likely to celebrate in Cachtice, where Bathory's reign of terror still haunts locals, but for some -- me included -- there's a strange fascination. In the lovely Slovakian town of Trencin, my friend Martin and I are joined by two guides, Ivan Kralik and Peter Pastier, who work in the local tourism office. They drive us to the town of Cachtice, 30 kilometers away, recounting the story of the Blood Countess. The macabre name came from her apparent tendency to bathe in the blood of her victims. She's said to have believed the blood of virgin girls would maintain her youthful-looking skin. Bathory's life has been the subject of films, books and online websites -- and is thought by some to have influenced Bram Stoker's 1897 novel ""Dracula"" -- but seems to have been forgotten west of Vienna. Highborn and unaccountable, she was the absolute ruler of a patch of what is now Slovakia, and with the help of three of her servants sadistically tortured to death between 100 and 650 girls. We'll never know the exact number. Missing daughters . She was married to a nobleman, Ferenc Nadasdy, a Hungarian national hero of the wars against the Turks. Although there were reported killings before his death in 1604, afterward she seems to have become totally unhinged. She settled in Cachtice and more and more girls started disappearing from the surrounding villages. It was said she eventually ran low of girls to satiate her habit and she began to lure victims of higher born families, who began to notice their missing daughters. By 1610, rumors of her horrible deeds had reached the Hungarian king, who sent his second in command, Palatine Georgy Thurzo, to investigate. In December 1610, Bathory was arrested along with three of her servants, who were tortured and burned at the stake. She wasn't put on trial but walled-in at Cachtice Castle, where she died on August 21, 1614. Castle restoration . Cachtice today is a well-off village with large houses sporting high hedges, satellite dishes and top-end SUVs parked in the driveways. We could be anywhere in Central Europe but for a large, wooden statue of Elizabeth Bathory in the main square. A sign points us to the castle, which stands 2.5 kilometers away in the middle of a thickly forested nature reserve. It's a pleasant 40-minute walk up the narrow stony path under oak, beech and chestnut trees, through mulberry bushes and wild strawberries. The castle is a ruin, but pictured alone against a blue sky, looks majestic and aloof. It reopened in June 2014 after a much needed two-year restoration. One tower collapsed in the 1980s leaving only two towers standing: an eastern defensive tower with a chapel and a south-facing residential tower where Countess Bathory died. Amazingly, it's still possible to walk around her living quarters, the likely location of her imprisonment and death. The roof has long disappeared, but the wall shows the sign of a ceiling. I reckoned it's four meters (13 feet) high in a four-by-five meter room. I shiver as I see the remnants of what looks like a bricked-up window. Sense of shame . What do the locals think of the Countess today? ""The older generation seems ashamed of her. There were some protests when Bathory's statue was erected in the square,"" says 18-year-old Adam Pisca, who has a summer job as a castle guide. ""The younger generation doesn't view the past so bad. We know she murdered women but she is not important to us. ""Before the castle reconstruction, we had barbecues inside and camped in tents overnight!"" Back in the village, we step into the 14th-century church of St. Ladislav where Father Vladimir Ondas shows us around. Elizabeth Bathory was buried here, but no one has found her grave. Her body was probably moved later to Nagyesced, the Bathory ancestral seat in today's Hungary. Father Vladimir has a surprise for us, however. He unlocks the Gothic chapel outside, which boasts three painted wooden panels from Cachtice Castle. They are the only items remaining from the castle's interior decoration. Next to the church there's a small but interesting museum with portraits of Elizabeth Bathory and the people in her life, a reproduction of her clothes, old castle gravures and photos, as well as a range of heraldic insignia and local costumes. But it's the local wine co-op we really want to see, and not just for the wine. The building stands on the site of the old Bathory manor house. It's here that the Countess conducted most of her torture sessions. Today only an external wall still stands, but the original cellars that have seen so much pain and anguish are intact and are now used to store several wine barrels. Jozef Carada, one of the co-op owners, provides us with a tasting. The wines are uniformly excellent. Some bear a ""Bathory Blood"" label. The brand was discontinued in 2010, but after customer pressure, it was reintroduced in 2014 along with a special vintage celebrating the 400th anniversary of her death. It's ruby red, of course. Visiting Cachtice . Visitors will need their own wheels to get to Cachtice Castle. The closest town with decent hotels is Trencin, 30 kilometers north of the village of Cachtice. The best way to get there is by rail. There are 10 direct trains per day (60-80 minutes travel time from Bratislava). Tickets cost €6-16 ($8-21) each way. There's a (slow) bus service; the travel time is approximately two hours; tickets cost €6/$8. The best hotel in Trencin is the four-star Hotel Elizabeth (Generala Milana Rastislava Stefanika 2, Trencin; +421 32 6506 111, double room from $132).

"The Obama administration plans to impose fresh sanctions against Iran's petrochemical industry, diplomatic sources familiar with the plans said Friday. U.S. sanctions already prohibit American companies from doing business with Iran. The goal of the new measures is to bar foreign companies from doing business with Iran's petrochemical industry by threatening them with being banned from U.S. markets,  the sources said. European nations are expected to announce similar measures when the European Union leaders meet next week, the sources said. The sources did not want to be named because they are not authorized to speak on record before officials roll out the sanctions. The measures, which the sources said are expected to be announced early Monday, build on existing sanctions on Iran's oil and gas industry. Plans for the additional sanctions come on the heels of a report by the U.N. nuclear watchdog IAEA detailing evidence that the Iranian regime was developing the technology needed to build a nuclear weapon. On Friday, the International Atomic Energy Agency board of governors issued a resolution expressing ""deep and increasing concern about the unresolved issues regarding the Iranian nuclear program."" But the U.N. agency's resolution did not threaten action to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions. Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and has called the U.N. watchdog's report ""unbalanced"" and ""politically motivated."" The Obama administration is facing increased pressure from Congress to turn up the heat on Iran, including sanctioning the Iranian central bank. This week, Republican Sen. Mark Kirk  introduced an amendment that would impose sanctions on foreign financial institutions that do business with Iran's central bank. U.S. officials have said the administration has been reluctant to cut off the central bank out of concern it could drive  up oil prices and hurt the U.S. economy. But the diplomatic sources said the U.S. has discussed some possible sanctions on the bank by limiting some financial transactions, but not cutting it off completely.","U.S. sanctions already prohibit  companies from doing business with Iran .

"New York St. Patrick's Day parade organizers Wednesday said they will allow the first ever LGBT group to march in 2015 with an identifying banner -- ending a longstanding ban that drew national criticism and corporate boycotts. The group being allowed to march was the only LGBT affiliated group to apply, said William O'Reilly, a spokesman for parade organizers. He said other LGBT groups can apply to march in 2016. The New York parade is the nation's oldest. O'Reilly said LGBT community members have always been encouraged to march under the traditional apolitical banners of other marching groups. New York City's St. Patrick's Day parade, which has been held for more than 250 years, historically banned LGBT groups from marching under their own banner. That's changing. Last March, Mayor Bill de Blasio declined to march in the Manhattan parade, and Mayor Martin Walsh sat out the event in Boston, where a similar ban remains in place. Three of the country's biggest beer companies also withdrew their sponsorships because gay and lesbians were excluded. Sam Adams, owned by Boston Beer Co., pulled out as a sponsor for the Boston parade, and Guinness and Heineken pulled out from the New York parade. ""This is progress,"" de Blasio told reporters, adding that he needed more information before deciding whether to march next year. ""What I've called for for a long time is an inclusive parade. This is a city of inclusion."" Gay rights advocates also applauded the change. ""It's about time,"" Sarah Kate Ellis, president of GLAAD, said in a statement. ""Discrimination has no place on America's streets, least of all on Fifth Avenue. As an Irish-Catholic American, I look forward to a fully inclusive St. Patrick's Day Parade that I can share with my wife and children, just as my own parents shared with me. Until then, parade organizers must be held accountable to ending this ban once and for all."" In an interview, Ellis said de Blasio's refusal to march and the loss of corporate sponsors were the ""straws that broke the camel's back."" ""I'm cautiously optimistic that this is definitely an important and historic step in the right direction but I will be watching to see how this unfolds over the next year,"" she said. The gay group marching in New York this year is Out@NBCUniversal, a resource group of LGBT employees at NBCUniversal, according to O'Reilly. ""WNBC-TV has long been the broadcast partner of the Parade, so there was a relationship already established,"" O'Reilly said via email. In Boston, no change in policy has been announced but longtime gay activist Cathy Renna said she hoped the New York decision will ""make folks in Boston rethink their position."" ""They really need to get with the times,"" Renna said. But Boston parade organizer Philip Wuschke. Jr. told CNN that no change was planned. ""Many gay people march in Boston's St. Patrick's Day Parade,"" he said. Obama bars federal contractors from LGBT discrimination .

"British police are investigating a video released Friday that shows an unmasked and apparent British ISIS fighter, a spokesperson for Prime Minister David Cameron says. ""The police are urgently investigating the contents of the video, including possible terrorism offenses relating to it,"" the spokesperson said. The video was released the same day ISIS used another video to make public the beheading of Briton Alan Henning, 47 and threaten the life of U.S. aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, known as Peter Kassig before he converted to Islam. Henning, a 47-year-old taxi driver from Manchester, northern England, was part of a team of volunteers who traveled to Syria in December 2013 to deliver aid to people affected by the country's devastating civil war. He was abducted by masked gunmen the day after Christmas, others in the aid convoy said. ISIS blamed its killing of Henning on the UK's decision to join the U.S.-led bombing campaign against the group in Iraq and Syria. Officials from Britain's intelligence agencies, Foreign Office, Home Office, police and military updated Cameron Saturday on work to take down the video of Henning and find those responsible, the Downing Street spokesperson said. ""The PM was clear that we must keep doing all we can to ensure that these terrorists are found and brought to justice for their heinous crimes and we will keep working with our U.S. partners and those in the region to do this. ISIS ""brutality will not persuade us to change our approach. Indeed, the senseless murder of an innocent man only reinforces our resolve to defeat this terrorist organization and to eradicate the threat they pose to Britons -- whether those in the region or here on the streets of the UK,"" the spokesperson said. UK jets began flying reconnaissance flights over Iraq a week ago, and on Tuesday dropped their first missiles on an ISIS heavy-weapon position and an armed pickup truck in Iraq, according to the UK Defense Ministry. Henning appears to be the fourth Westerner to be beheaded on camera by ISIS. This summer, ISIS beheaded American freelance journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff -- showing their gruesome killings in videos posted online. ISIS then claimed its first British victim, aid worker David Haines, according to video that appeared online on September 13. Henning's family had pleaded for his release and said in a statement it was ""numb with grief"" at news of his death. ""It is the news we hoped we would never hear. As a family we are devastated by the news of his death. There are few words to describe how we feel at this moment,"" his wife, Barbara, said in a written statement released Saturday by the United Kingdom's Foreign Office. ""We always knew that Alan was in the most dangerous of situations but we hoped that he would return home to us. That is not to be."" UK authorities believe at least 500 British citizens have gone to Iraq and Syria, many of them to fight with ISIS and other Islamist groups -- and that most will try to return, bringing their extremist views with them. Cameron last month laid out new measures to tackle the threat posed by would-be UK jihadists, days after Britain raised its terror threat level from ""substantial"" to ""severe.""","UK officials are investigating a video showing an unmasked apparent British ISIS fighter .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Hollywood should apologize to Iran for ""insults and accusations against the Iranian nation,"" a top aide to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told a visiting Hollywood delegation Sunday. ""The Wrestler,"" starring Mickey Rourke was also attacked for being insulting towards Iran. Oscar-nominated ""American Beauty"" star Annette Bening was among the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to hear the remarks, Iran's state-run ISNA news agency said. ""Representatives of Iran's film industry should only have an official meeting with representatives of the Academy and Hollywood if they apologize for the insults and accusations against the Iranian nation during the past 30 years,"" said Javad Shamghadri, Ahmadinejad's advisor on the arts, ISNA reported. He singled out the 1991 Sally Field thriller ""Not Without My Daughter,"" about an American woman who marries an Iranian and then tries to flee Iran with their child, and the comic-book-inspired action flick ""300"" as ""two clear examples of total lies."" Do you think an apology is warranted? TheHollywood delegation, which ISNA said also includes AMPAS president Sid Ganis, is supposed to meet with Iranian filmmakers and hold a news conference on March 7. The Academy did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. But Shamghadri demanded to know how the meetings could produce results. ""How can we sit and have a sincere meeting with American film makers while they they humiliate and insult the Iranian people and the great revolution of this nation?"" he asked, ISNA reported. ""The Iranian nation and its revolution has repeatedly and undeservedly been attacked by Hollywood movies,"" he said. ""The film ""The Wrestler"" is the latest among them,"" he said of the film for which Mickey Rourke received an Oscar nomination this year. ""We know that even right now there are other films being made with the aim of insulting and accusing the great nation of Iran and its rich culture.""

"Isa Saharkhiz and his son Mehdi haven't seen each other in nearly a decade. But the dream of a reunion between the dissident journalist and his 32-year-old son came one step closer to fruition when Iranian authorities unexpectedly released the elder Saharkhiz last week after imprisoning him for more than four years. ""Yes, it was a surprise,"" said Saharkhiz, speaking by phone to CNN from his home in Tehran. The longtime critic of the Iranian regime described how last Thursday, a prison official made an unannounced visit to the hospital room where he had been detained for months due to his deteriorating health conditions. ""He told me that 'you are released now,'"" Saharkhiz said. Within hours, he was back at his home surrounded by his wife and daughter and friends. Mehdi was at the design company in northern New Jersey where he works as a production manager when his relatives in Iran called with news of his father's release. ""I was really shocked,"" he recalled. Father was rounded up during 2009 unrest in Iran . Since 2009, the younger Saharkhiz has led a one-man digital campaign from his home in New Jersey aimed at liberating his father. ""I confess that I am not ashamed that my father is in prison. And I am proud of him...his bravery has made life harder for the cowards in power,"" Mehdi announced on camera in Farsi, in a 2009 video he posted on YouTube. The young man appeared in the video wearing a T-shirt printed with his father's portrait. Iranian security forces first arrested Isa Saharkhiz, 59, during the summer of 2009. The former journalist had been working as an international spokesman for the campaign of Mehdi Karroubi, a moderate politician who ran for president in June 2009. Huge street protests erupted that month after Iranian authorities declared the firebrand incumbent candidate Mahmoud Ahmadinejad winner of the election. Opposition groups accused the Iranian regime of rigging the results in favor of Ahmadinejad, a claim Tehran vehemently rejected. In the ensuing crackdown on what became known as the Green Movement, Karroubi and another opposition presidential candidate, Mir-Hossein Mousavi, were placed under house arrest. Security forces used brute force and widespread arrests to crush the street protests, while also rounding up top officials from Mousavi and Karroubi's political campaigns, including Isa Saharkhiz. ""They tortured me,"" he said, describing how officers beat him and broke his ribs during his initial detention. Iranian authorities justified the 2009 crackdown by frequently accusing opposition leaders of being part of a foreign conspiracy aimed at overthrowing the government.  Iranian officials also accused some protesters of being mohareb, or enemies of God. Chinese journalist Shi Tao released after 8 years in prison . Saharkhiz later received a sentence of three years in prison for conspiring against the government and insulting the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Singled out as a former insider? During his incarceration, the writer said he was subjected to physical and emotional abuse, while also being held in solitary confinement for long periods. ""In January, in the winter, they sent me on the roof of the jail for two hours when the weather was very cold,"" Saharkhiz said.  ""They put me out without any shoes, any socks, and very few clothes."" Experts say Iranian authorities reserved especially harsh treatment of well-known intellectuals such as Saharkhiz because he was a former regime insider, who had risen to prominence after the Islamic Revolution of 1979. For a decade, he worked as a reporter for one of the main state news agencies. He also founded a free-speech advocacy group called the Society for the Defense of Freedom on the Press. ""Saharkhiz is not an outsider to the regime. Like others in the reformist movement that emerged from within the ranks of the government of the Islamic Republic, Saharkhiz angered many, including the Supreme Leader,"" said Behzad Yaghmaian, an Iranian-American academic and author of ""Social Change in Iran."" Yaghmaian commended Saharkhiz for his ""principled resistance to the government and the supreme leader."" ""People like Saharkhiz are considered even more dangerous than those opposing the regime from outside,"" he added. As the elder Saharkhiz languished in prison in 2009, his son Mehdi became an opposition activist from the relative safety of exile in New Jersey. Using Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, Mehdi distributed amateur videos smuggled from Iran showing Iranian security forces beating and arresting demonstrators. ""The least I can do is get their voices out,"" he said, in a 2010 interview with CNN. Election of Rouhani may have had impact . Mehdi has lived in the United States for many years, and last year became a naturalized American citizen. His father was stationed in New York for several years in the 1990s while working for IRNA, the official Iranian news agency.  During that time, Mehdi attended high school in suburbs outside New York City. Four years after his arrest, the elder Saharkhiz said there was no formal reason given for his release.  But he said the move was likely linked to the recent election of Hassan Rouhani to the post of president. Several other dissidents detained during the 2009 crackdown were released last month, according to the English-language daily Tehran Times.  The Iranian government never issued a formal explanation for why these political prisoners were freed. Rouhani campaigned on a platform of reform and an end to Iran's international isolation. Last month, he called for a negotiated end to Tehran's long feud with Washington over its nuclear program.  His charm offensive during a visit to the United Nations General Assembly climaxed with a brief phone conversation with Barak Obama.  It was the first direct contact between American and Iranian presidents in more than 30 years. ""Not the system, but the situation has changed,"" explained Isa Saharkhiz, during his interview with CNN. Though optimistic about Rouhani's presidency, Saharkhiz warned that Iran was a ""double state,"" where true power lies in the hands of Supreme Leader Khamenei and senior military commanders. He argued that expanded relations with Washington and the removal of crippling economic sanctions would help moderate figures such as Rouhani engaged in policy and power struggles with Iranian hard-liners.  Removal of American embargoes would also help ordinary Iranians who could no longer afford life-saving foreign phamaceuticals, he said. Saharkhiz's note of cautious optimism was echoed by his son. ""There's a lot of hope from what Rouhani did in the U.S. and there's a lot of good response from the people,"" Mehdi said. ""But then you have a lot of people who were in charge before the election and are still in charge and don't like it."" Son not sure when he can travel to Tehran . For now, Mehdi says it is not safe for him to return to Iran to visit his father. He has yet to fulfill his mandatory Iranian military service, and he fears he could be detained due to his own outspoken criticism of the regime. ""Maybe in a few years I will be able to go back, but it's a really big risk,"" he said. Meanwhile, his father predicted he is still at risk of being thrown back in prison. ""I will support freedom in Iran, and maybe criticize the leadership in Iran,"" he said. ""So it is possible that they will come here and capture me again."" Both father and son hope, however, that the authorities will lift an earlier travel ban that prevented the veteran journalist from leaving Iran. If so, the two hope to reunite for the first time in more than a decade in a third country such as the United Arab Emirates or Turkey. ""It will be a very emotional time,"" Isa Saharkhiz said. It would be, his son said, a dream come true. In April: Four Italian journalists released from captivity in Syria .","Dissident journalist recently released from prison .

"The wife of an American pastor imprisoned in Iran pleaded with a House subcommittee on foreign affairs Thursday to do something to free her husband. Naghmeh Abedini said that her husband, Saeed Abedini, went to Iran to build an orphanage but was imprisoned unjustly because of his Christian beliefs. She said that when her family's ""nightmare"" began, she anticipated having to fight the Iranian government. But she feels shocked and deeply disappointed because she's had ""to battle my own government."" U.S. President Barack Obama pushed for the release of Abedini and two other detained Americans --  Robert Levinson and Amir Hekmati -- when he spoke on the phone with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in September. Saeed Abedini is a U.S. citizen of Iranian birth. In January, he was sentenced to eight years in prison, accused of attempting to undermine the Iranian government and endangering national security by establishing home churches. He had converted to Christianity from Islam and became a pastor in Idaho. He regularly made trips to Iran and was on a bus crossing from Turkey into Iran in the summer of 2012 when immigration officials took away his passport. He was later jailed. At the time of his detainment, an Iranian news agency reported that he would be released on bail. Abedini's case was not brought up at recent negotiations on an interim nuclear deal with Iran. In late November, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden was asked why. She replied that the talks in Geneva, Switzerland, concerning the deal were ""focused exclusively on nuclear issues."" Naghmeh Abedini told lawmakers Thursday that when U.S. and Iranian officials met to discuss the nuclear deal, the U.S. had a ""perfect"" opportunity to ask for the pastor's release. ""I feel my husband has been abandoned,"" she said. Iran's detention and torture of her 33-year-old husband constitutes an assault against U.S. national security, she said. The detention is ""an experiment"" because officials there are ""curious"" to see how strong Obama is, and whether he would take action immediately to free the pastor. She held up a photo of herself and her two young children taken on their first day of school this year. She said that it was a heartbreaking moment to be without her husband and that as Christmas approaches, she is praying for her husband and praying that her government realizes ""how far we've fallen"" with negotiating with Iran without pushing more to secure her husband's freedom. U.S. official: Obama, Rouhani discussed fate of three Americans . 'Religious persecution is real' In a written statement she gave to the subcommittee, she detailed her husband's ordeal. Her family says he is in a very dangerous prison because of his Christian faith. His wife said that the orphanage he was in Iran to set up had the approval of the Iranian government. Between 2000 and 2005, her husband had previously gotten into trouble with Iran's government because he was talking about his Christian faith with Iranian Christians in their homes, she said. At that time, Iran was ruled under a different government. It didn't make sense to her, and she finds it outrageous, that her husband would be held now for offenses related to religion. ""I am standing before you today because religious persecution is real,"" Naghmeh Abedini's statement read. ""And until we stand up as one -- as Americans, as political leaders, and government officials, as people who have been endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights -- we will not truly embrace the responsibility that comes with that freedom."" Her father, who is still in Iran, has been able to visit the pastor, it says. That has allowed her to learn about how her husband had been treated and injuries he's suffered. Before Thursday's hearing, she warned that her husband's health was deteriorating, and she talked Thursday about how he had been beaten and threatened in prison. In her statement, she explained that he was initially held in the notorious Evin Prison in Tehran, where guards and interrogators beat him. On November 3, the pastor was transferred to Rajai Shahr prison, the statement said, where he has been repeatedly robbed at knifepoint. ""At times he has awoken to find a knife-wielding prisoner standing over him at his bed."" Her husband has been beaten so badly that he could not stand, she said, and suffered internal bleeding. Nothing but the ""hand of God"" kept him alive, she said. ""The Iranian regime sends prisoners to Rajai Shahr to disappear. It sends prisoners to Rajai Shahr to deny them their human rights. It sends prisoners to Rajai Shahr to die."" A few months ago, the pastor was given medication and his condition improved, she wrote. A letter to the children . Naghmeh Abedini said her father showed her husband pictures of the couple's two children when he visited him in prison. ""Saeed would just stare at the pictures the entire time for the few short minutes they were able to talk,"" her statement says. Once, her husband was able to compose a letter to his children. ""It is so hard and so heart breaking for me to see these pictures and to know that I am not there beside you as you grow,"" he wrote. ""I came here to help the kids that did not have mommies and daddies, but my own kids lost their daddy."" On the eve of her testimony, the pastor's wife spoke to CNN's Jim Sciutto about the pain her family has endured. ""I think it's the worst torture to see your kids suffering and not being able to do anything,"" she said. ""My hope is -- I know it might be too much, hoping too much -- is having him home by Christmas. ... it will be a very difficult Christmas scene..."" she said. ""...it's not just for my husband, it's for my kids. Hopefully we will have daddy home for Christmas."" There are two other Americans who have disappeared in Iran or have been imprisoned. Bob Levinson, a retired FBI agent, has been kept in the dark about him since he vanished on a business trip to Iran in March 2007. President Rouhani has told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that the nation's officials don't know where the American is. Levinson is in his 60s and suffers from diabetes. Another American, Amir Hekmati, is a former U.S. Marine. He has been jailed in Iran since 2011, accused of being a CIA spy. Hekmati joined the Marines in 2001 out of high school. He finished his service four years later as a decorated combat veteran with tours in Iraq.
