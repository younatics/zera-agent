So it should be no surprise that Sir Ben Ainslie hasn’t let a little patch of water like the Atlantic get in the way of his latest relationship. The Olympic hero is dating former Sky Sports presenter Georgie Thompson, who has now made her home in New York – and is perhaps best known for going out with one half of Ant and Dec. Sir Ben, 36, and Miss Thompson, also 36, have been in a steady relationship since April. Revealed: The couple have been spending time together in America where he has been living in San Francisco . He has a £650,000 home in Lymington, Hampshire, although he has recently been living in San Francisco as he masterminded the US’s victory over New Zealand in the America’s Cup. Sir Ben, who has won four gold medals and one silver over five Olympic Games, was previously with Dutch sailor Marit Bouwmeester, 25. She won a silver in last summer’s Olympics at Weymouth on the same day as Sir Ben won his latest gold. Privately educated Miss Thompson, is the former girlfriend of ITV star Declan Donnelly, one half of Geordie duo Ant and Dec. The 36-year-old, now presenting for Fox Sports, was dating Declan Donnelly for two years until 2011 . They split in 2011 after two years, with his apparent lack of decisiveness about their future together reportedly the issue, although she insists ‘there’s no animosity between us’. The Leeds University graduate previously worked for Sky TV in the UK and is now a presenter for Fox Sports in the US. The couple have known each other for three years. In an interview with this Saturday’s forthcoming issue of the Daily Mail’s Weekend magazine, Miss Thompson said: ‘We met through friends at an event – and I don’t really know how to describe it. Champion: The sailing hero shows his four Olympic gold and one Olympic silver medal on the River Thames . They have known each other for three years. Thompson describes their meeting as 'a thunderbolt moment' ‘It was a bit of a thunderbolt moment but a thunderbolt that took years before it became anything real. We were in different places but then in April the stars aligned and it made sense to be together, and we haven’t looked back since. It’s very special – he makes me very happy.’ Now Sir Ben’s America’s Cup stint is over, Miss Thompson says they will be able to spend more time together – although last week he flew back to Britain. In a recent interview, he hinted that a family may soon be on the cards. ‘I better sort that out at some stage soon,’ he said. ‘I’m getting a bit old, turning into a bit of a wrinkly old seadog.’","Sir Ben, 36, and Georgie Thompson, also 36, met three years ago at a party .

Beauty school may sound like something from Grease, but Sephora has made it a reality for us non-professionals with their new University Beauty Classes. On Sunday, FEMAIL went bare-faced to a Flawless Foundation class at Sephora SoHo in New York City to determine whether the average woman really needs to master the skills usually left to make-up artists. During the lesson, a team of beauty experts taught us invaluable skills for applying eye cream, concealer and foundation - and unlike your average beauty school, the whole course took just two hours. Beauty school: On Sunday, FEMAIL went bare-faced to a Flawless Foundation class at Sephora SoHo, where a team of beauty experts instructed us on the correct way to make-up . The class - which had the . added morning perk of free coffee and breakfast - is one of many that . are being offered on Sundays at Sephora locations around the country - and it's free . if you sign up on the website as a 'Beauty Insider'. After pouring myself a coffee and grabbing a cereal bar, I took my seat at one of the four tables, which were set with clipboards, pens and various cosmetics tools. The beauty experts introduced themselves, asked us our biggest concerns when it comes to applying foundation and told us how the class would be structured. Next, we were ushered to the cleansing station, where we wiped off any excess make-up or bacteria before picking out a foundation. To determine which foundation suits . your skin, Sephora uses a technology developed by Pantone called Color . IQ, a kind of camera that identifies exactly what skin tone you are. Once you have your 'IQ' number, the machine tells you every product in the entire store that matches up with your skin. Suits your skin: Beauty experts helped me pick out the best moisturizer, eye cream (both from Origins) and foundation (Touche Eclat by Yves Saint Laurent) for my complexion . Instruments: We had a choice of tools for applying foundation - a make-up brush, which is good for a 'buffing' technique, or the Beauty Blender- a hot pink egg-shaped sponge . I was recommended to use Le Teint Touche Eclat, a liquid foundation by Yves Saint Laurent with a golden undertone. After putting the foundation in my Sephora basket, I was led over to the moisturizer station, where another expert figured out which moisturizer and eye cream I should be using based on my skin sensitivity and concerns. A helpful tip for applying the . products came from beauty expert Aneeka, who told us to apply our eye . cream first to give our eyes 'a chance to plumpen'. Instead of rubbing it in with your . forefingers though, she said we should use our ring fingers for the . lightest amount of pressure, gently dabbing the cream under our eyes and . up to the outside edge of our eyebrows. Highlighting and contouring: I started, as I was told to, at the top of the ear, and brushed in a downward diagonal motion, stopping two inches below the outside edge of my eye . The art of application: Using a Make-Up Forever palette (pictured), I was given a fan-shaped brush to apply the contouring color . We had a choice of tools for applying foundation - the #55 brush, which is good for a 'buffing' technique, or the Beauty Blender, a hot pink egg-shaped sponge. I chose the former, and started at the center of my face, as instructed, since that is where the most redness is. Another useful tip I learned was to . always keep my foundation brush clean and bacteria-free by wiping it . with antibacterial soap after each use. Next . came the most anticipated part of the class - highlighting and . contouring, a favorite technique among A-listers and fashionistas. Using a Make-Up Forever palette, I was given a fan-shaped brush to apply the contouring color first. Make-up masters: Sephora also offers classes on how to do a smoky eye, use colorful eye make-up, put on false eyelashes, transition from day to night eye make-up and learn about skincare . New skill: The two-hour lesson - which ends with a certificate of completion - is one of many that are being offered at Sephora locations around the city - and it's free if you sign up on the website as a 'Beauty Insider' I . started, as I was told to, at the top of the ear, and brushed in a . downward diagonal motion, stopping two inches below the outside edge of . my eye. For highlighting, which is supposed to add radiance, I used another Touche Eclat product, dabbing it lightly on the top of my cheekbones and the tip of my nose. One of our beauty experts Juan gave us some memorable highlighting advice. He said to draw 'Chanel Cs' around your eyes, starting under the eyebrows and ending below the eyes. And to top it all off, he recommended using a finishing spray to set the make-up in place and guarantee that it will last throughout the day. Upon finishing the class, I was given a 'certificate of completion' from the amazingly friendly SoHo team, which I fully plan on hanging on my wall - as well as adding to my resume. Sephora also offers classes on how to do a smoky eye, use colorful eye make-up, put on false eyelashes, transition from day to night eye make-up and learn about skincare.","To find your perfect foundation, Sephora uses a technology called Color IQ, which takes a picture of your skin and determines its exact color .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:27 EST, 23 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:15 EST, 23 October 2013 . Piracy charges against jailed Greenpeace activists in Russia have been dropped and they have been charged with hooliganism instead. It means that instead of a possible 15 years imprisonment for piracy they could face seven years in jail. There is also still the possibility they could be charged with using force against official which carries a punishment of ten year imprisonment, Greenpeace noted. Piracy charges against the 'Arctic 30' have been dropped and replaced by hooliganism claims . The Greenpeace activists and journalists, who have been held in a Russian prison since being arrested in a protest against oil company Gazprom's platform in the Arctic's Pechora Sea last month, 'are no more hooligans than they were pirates,' according to Greenpeace. Nothing less than the release of the detainees - dubbed The Arctic 30 - and the withdrawal of these 'trumped up' charges would be acceptable, Greenpeace argued. 'This is still a wildly disproportionate charge that carries up to seven years in jail. It represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest,' a spokesman said. 'Those brave men and women went to the Arctic armed with nothing more than a desire to shine a light on a reckless business. They should be with their families, not in a prison in Murmansk. 'We will contest the trumped-up charge of hooliganism as strongly as we contested the piracy allegations. They are both fantasy charges that bear no relation to reality. The Arctic 30 protested peacefully against Gazprom's dangerous oil drilling and should be free.' The move follows a comment by President Vladimir Putin, who said last month that he does not think the Greenpeace activists are pirates. A group of 28 Greenpeace activists, a Russian photographer and a British videographer have been held since their ship, the Arctic Sunrise was seized by the Russian coast guard after protesting outside a Gazprom-owned oil rig September 18. A total of six Britons are being held. The Greenpeace spokesman said: 'The Investigative Committee also say they may charge some activists with use of force against officials, carrying up to ten years in jail. 'Greenpeace has a 42 year history of entirely peaceful activism, it is a cheap libel to accuse those campaigners of doing anything other than protesting peacefully, they arrived at that oil rig in a ship painted with a dove and a rainbow. 'Our ship was seized by men with knives and guns, while the Arctic 30 raised their arms. They should be released immediately.' Kieron Bryan, a British freelance videographer, stands in a defendants' cage in a regional court in Russia . The Arctic 30 and their boat were taken from waters near the port of Murmansk on September 19 after two of them tried to board the rig. Those arrested include citizens of Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland, France, Sweden, Poland, Turkey and Ukraine and the US. Greenpeace has warned a spill in Arctic waters would be highly damaging to the environment and the extraction of more fossil fuels would add to climate change impacts. Gazprom's plans to start drilling from the Prirazlomnaya platform in the first quarter of 2014 raised the risk of an oil spill in an area that contains three nature reserves protected by Russian law, campaigners have said. A high-profile international campaign calling for their release has seen 11 Nobel Peace Prize laureates, including South African archbishop Desmond Tutu, write a letter to Mr Putin urging that the piracy charges be dropped. The letter came after German chancellor Angela Merkel became the first head of state to raise the issue of the crew's detention with Mr Putin, urging a speedy resolution of the case in a phone call. The families of the Britons involved have also met Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials to discuss what was being done to bring their loved ones home.","Hooliganism charges carry a maximum seven years imprisonment - down from the possible 15 years associated with piracy .

Guards patrolling a prison colony in Russia's north saw a cat on the fence that was apparently carrying something. On a closer look, they found two mobile phones and chargers taped to the male cat's belly. The federal prison service said the incident happened last Friday evening at Penal Colony No 1 near the city of Syktyvkar in Komi province, 600 miles north-east of Moscow. It was not immediately clear how the cat was supposed to drop off its loot. A spokesman for the jail said: ‘Two packages were taped to the animal’s back. ‘When the packages were unwrapped, guards found objects prohibited in the penitentiary facility - two cell phones with batteries and chargers. 'Obviously we can’t question the cat, but someone somewhere knows who he was delivering these items to and we will hold him until we find out.’ It follows an incident in north-east Brazil in January when a cat carrying a saw and mobile phone was 'detained' as it entered a prison gate.

A jealous husband shot his wife in a hairdressing salon after discovering she had been unfaithful with his solicitor, an inquest heard yesterday. Darren Williams blasted his hairdresser wife in the legs with a sawn-off shotgun before shouting: ‘Rachel, I love you’. The father-of-two then fled the scene and hanged himself in a wood near his home. Jealous husband: Darren Williams, 45, blasted his wife Rachel, 38, with a double-barrelled shotgun in Newport. The couple are pictured (left) on their wedding day in 2005 and Mrs Williams is seen (right) in hospital . Mrs Williams, who described her husband as ‘jealous, controlling and possessive’ told the hearing: ‘I considered my marriage to be over and started divorce proceedings. ‘Then while on a night out I met a man, a solicitor, who had in the past acted for Darren on criminal matters. I was unfaithful to my marriage vows with this person. ‘One of Darren’s friends had learned about my brief affair and had threatened to tell Darren if I didn’t. I did not tell him but I believe someone must have done.’ Mrs Williams, 38, was at work in the Carol Ann’s hair salon in  Newport, south Wales, when her husband burst in on August 19 2011. He opened fire shooting Rachel in the leg – and peppering the owner and customers with shot. In a statement, Mrs Williams said: ‘Darren came with a black gym bag and pulled out a sawn-off shotgun. Injured: Mrs Williams wrestled the gun from her husband before he ran from the salon, the inquest heard . ‘I immediately thought he was going to kill me and shouted, “Dar, No!” He hit me across the head with the butt of the shotgun and I fell to the floor. 'I brought my leg up to protect me and he fired the first of two shots from point blank range. Then he discharged the second saying, “Rachel, I love you”.’ The inquest heard Mrs Williams wrestled the gun from her lorry driver husband before he ran from the salon. The attack left her with serious injuries needing a ten-hour operation to save her left leg and extensive reconstructive surgery. Days before the shooting, Mr Williams had been arrested following reports that he had threatened to kill the solicitor that his wife had slept with. Mrs Williams told the inquest that her husband was a violent and jealous man. She said: ‘As long as he got his own way he was okay, he was intimidating and knew that where I was concerned he could do what he liked. Darren was on steroids and anti-depressants which made him violent and unpredictable.’ Investigation: Mrs Williams (pictured left in hospital) was shot at Carol Ann’s Hair Stylist (right) in South Wales . Shooting: The inquest heard that if he had not killed himself, Mr Williams would have been charged with attempting to murder his wife . Her husband was also on bail for domestic assault charges when he shot his wife. He had appeared at Newport Crown Court on gun charges and engaged a local solicitor with whom his wife later allegedly started an affair. His sister Rachael told the hearing: ‘Darren was told about the infidelity on his birthday, the 10th of August. 'I can only imagine his reaction – devastation. Before that he had blamed himself for the breakdown of the marriage.’ Detective Inspector Justin O’Keefe said: ‘Rachel had a liaison with a man who was known to Darren. This man had acted as his solicitor in the past. ‘On Wednesday August 11, we received reports he was on his way to kill that solicitor and he was arrested.’ The inquest heard if he had not killed himself, Williams would have been charged with attempting to murder his wife. Williams’s other sister, Lisa Edwards said the day before the shooting he had told her: ‘I’m going to get Rachel back for what she did to me. ‘I’m going to get my revenge, I don’t want to kill her I want to shoot both of her legs. I’m going to go bang bang.’ Gwent Coroner David Bowen said Williams’ death was a result of his own action. He said: ‘Whether it was due to the realisation of the enormity of what he had done, the irreparable breakdown of his marriage, his wife’s infidelity or his previous involvement with the police it is unnecessary for me to decide.’ He recorded a verdict that Mr Williams committed suicide while suffering an imbalance of the mind. After the hearing, Mr Williams’ mother, Barbara, said: ‘To sleep with his solicitor is unbelievable. ‘We are convinced that is what pushed Darren over the edge.’ The solicitor was not named in court, but Mr Williams’ family have named him as Gareth Driscoll of Driscoll and Young Solicitors in Newport. Mr Driscoll, who lives in Cardiff, denies an affair with Mrs Williams.","Darren Williams, 45, blasted wife Rachel, 38, with double-barrelled shotgun .

Nine out of ten CQC staff members believe there is a culture of bullying at the NHS watchdog, a shocking report has found. Analysis of the Care Quality Commission – the shamed quango which has faced damning criticism for its failure to spot a number of healthcare scandals – found that 92 per cent of staff felt bullied or harassed. Staff said there was a culture of ‘systemic bullying’ with many too frightened to speak out even when promised anonymity because they believed the bullying might get worse or they would be punished as a result. The CQC was accused of failing to pick up on systematic neglect at Mid Staffs and Morecambe Bay trusts. Staff said they were 'overwhelmed' by work . Workers charged with inspecting hospitals for abuse and neglect were ‘overwhelmed’ by work, caught in a ‘blame’ game and ‘broken’ by the behaviour of their managers. The £54,000 report was commissioned by the CQC last December after new chairman David Behan said allegations of bullying were ‘shocking and unacceptable’. It comes a month after the CQC – the official watchdog for inspections of hospitals, care homes, GP practices and dentists – was condemned for covering up its failure to spot problems at Morecambe Bay hospitals where up to 16 babies died through neglect. In a bid to protect their reputations, bosses at the watchdog told officials to destroy a damning document which said its inspection of the hospital – which gave the trust the all-clear – had been flawed. The CQC has also been accused of failing to spot the horrific abuse of disabled patients at Winterbourne View hospital. Former inspectors who exposed catastrophic failings claimed they had been bullied, harassed and gagged to prevent them criticising the regulator. Kay Sheldon, a CQC board member, tried to warn that patients were being put in danger by the organisation’s poor performance. But Dame Jo Williams, chairman at the time, allegedly used taxpayers’ money to commission a mental health assessment of Miss Sheldon and tried to get her suspended. The £54,000 report was commissioned by the CQC last December after new chairman David Behan said allegations of bullying were ¿shocking and unacceptable¿ . Miss Sheldon welcomed the news, tweeting: ‘Bullying culture in organisation was one of the main concerns I raised in 2011. Completely refuted by board & exec team.’ Altogether 92 per cent of the 236 CQC staff who gave evidence felt they had been bullied or harassed in the workplace. The report’s authors, at consultancy firm People Opportunities, believe the problem affected ‘the whole organisation’. Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘The CQC appears not only to have let down the patients it was charged with protecting, but also the commission’s own staff. ‘No wonder it was unable to expose failings within the NHS when it presided over its own culture of bullying and poor management. ‘The organisation urgently needs to show it provides value for taxpayers’ money if it is to retain the faith of the people picking up its bills.’ CQC chief executive David Behan said: ‘We are very grateful for the staff who came forward to share their experiences. Without their honesty and courage, we would not have been able to identify improvements that need to be made.’ 'Horrified': Ann Clwyd . The biggest hospital in Wales has been branded ‘dangerous’ in a damning report, while an MP compared it to the 2010 scandal at the Mid Staffs Trust. The report, from the Royal College of Surgeons , claimed patients  at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff had died while stuck on the waiting lists  for operations and that its A&E department was failing to cope with demand. It warned: ‘Patients are clearly coming to harm. In cardiac surgery we heard patients are regularly dying on the waiting list.’ The perception among doctors, the report said, was that operations were being cut to save money. Labour MP Ann Clwyd, whose husband died at the hospital, said: ‘To hear from the RCS through a leaked report that departments are dangerous, with patients dying regularly, that is horrifying – and particularly because we didn’t know about it. ‘The situation sounds to me  similar to the Mid Staffs situation. This is the Welsh Mid Staffs moment.’ Health board chief Adam Cairns apologised for poor performance at the hospital, but rejected calls for his resignation.","92 per cent of staff at Care Quality Commission said they felt bullied or harassed .

Details of a massacre, possibly one of the deadliest since the start of the conflict in Syria, have been released in a report released today by Human Rights Watch. It claims Syrian forces brutally slaughtered 248 people in the coastal towns of al-Bayda and Baniyas in May. Details of a sickening massacre, one of the deadliest since the start of the conflict in Syria, have been released in a report released today by Human Rights Watch. It has been claimed that government and pro-government forces executed, or attempted to execute, entire families in the two towns . Based on witness accounts and video evidence, Human Rights Watch determined that the overwhelming majority were executed after military clashes ended and opposition fighters had retreated . The evidence is based on interviews with 15 al-Bayda residents and 5 from Baniyas . The chilling accounts are detailed in the 68-page report, 'No One’s Left’: Summary Executions by Syrian Forces in . al-Bayda and Baniyas' and are based on interviews with 15 al-Bayda . residents and 5 from Baniyas. The details have been compiled from accounts given by people who saw or heard the forces detain and then execute their relatives. It lists 167 people killed in al-Bayda and 81 in Baniyas. The report concludes that the overwhelming majority were executed after military clashes ended and opposition fighters had retreated. It also warns that the actual number of fatalities is probably even higher, particularly in Baniyas, but that the area is difficult to access and account for the dead. On the morning of May 2, Syrian . government forces and pro-government militias clashed with opposition . fighters in al-Bayda, a town of about 7,000 residents 10 kilometres from . the coastal city of Baniyas. The area is considered a Sunni . antigovernment enclave within the largely Alawite and pro-government . Tartous governorate. Witnesses said that after the local opposition . fighters retreated, at about 1pm, government and pro-government . forces entered the town and searched the houses.

Hurricane Sandy, the superstorm that swept across New York City a year ago, has some very young survivors. It was no small feat when James Grifio and his staff ay the NYU Fertility Center managed to save embryos in incubators during a storm induced power outage. They also managed to salvage the eggs in the ovaries of 21 women. James Grifio, director if the NYU Fertility Center, told ABC News  that seven lucky New Yorkers have babies known as 'Sandy Saves.' Another six women are expecting. NYU Fertility Center managed to save fragile invitro embryos from dying during Hurricaine Sandy . The Manhattan Clinic lost power shortly after Sandy struck. Even though a generator on top of the 8-story building kept the incubators running through the night, flooding in the basement cut off the incubators fuel supply at 8:15 the next morning. Dedicated to his patients, Grifio picked up several staff members at 6 a.m. the morning after the storm and drove them to the clinic. 'Thankfully, there were so many people who worked together,' Grifo said of the heroic rescue mission. 'To be a part of that was just amazing.' NYU Fertility Center (right) director James Grifio (left) and his team of staff managed to salvage all of the embryos in his lab during Hurricane Sandy . It took some valiant efforts from the fertility clinic staff to keep the fragile embryos from cooling. Grifio and his team managed to carry five gallon cans of diesel fuel up the 8-story building to fuel the generator. 'Our pregnancy rates stayed the same, as if the storm had never happened,'said Grifio. Not only was Grifio able to save the embryos in incubators but he was able to continue the fertilization  process in women who needed daily injections to force their bodies into ovulating. Hurricane Sandy flooded several parts of New York City and most of lower Manhattan . A shot of human gonadotropin frees the eggs for collection just 35 hours later and time is of the essence in collecting the fragile eggs. One patient had her egg retrieval scheduled for 10 a.m. the morning after the storm. Grifio, who cared more about his patient than his business, took one woman to a clinic on Madison Avenue. 'I loaded her, her husband and their 1-year-old baby into my car,' said Grifo, recalling how he rushed the family to another clinic up an eerily-empty Madison Avenue. 'And she had a baby from that cycle!' Then and now: severe flooding in Battery Park during Hurricane Sandy is now just a memory . The Madison Avenue clinic was a 'fierce competitor' but Grifio knew that he would be unable to perform the procedure. 'The backup power protected the incubators, but we couldn't take the chance of doing an egg retrieval,' said Grifio. 'It's a testament to the people in New York who work in medicine,' he added. 'Some of our most vicious competitors offered assistance.' Anything frozen in the clinic was not in danger, reports the Huffington Post. Grifio and his staff also managed to freeze the embryos in liquid nitrogen for 6 patients who were scheduled to have the embryos transferred later that week. Those patients had to wait a month--but no embryos were lost. The generator has since been restarted and has worked ever since. Thanks to the kindness of other fertility clinics Grifio was able to continue performing egg retrievals. The New Hope Fertility Clinic in Columbus Circle lent Grifio space to conduct his delicate treatments. Grifio received offers of help from around the country, he said, which points to the fact that, 'the people in this field understand that there is a patient at the end of this. Everybody is working together not to compromise patient cycles.' The identity of the families who Grifio helped conceive children during Hurricane Sandy has not been released.","James Grifio of NYU Fertility Center and his staff carried five gallon cans of diesel fuel up the 8-story building to fuel the clinic's generator .

A reporter who was granted access to the death row wing where convicted murderer Scott Peterson is being held has released pictures and details of what is life on the inside is like. Nancy Mullane became the first reporter to enter death row in California in almost a decade, something she worked tirelessly for years to achieve so she could write her book Life After Murder. Speaking to Matt Lauer, she revealed she has been going inside San Quentin prison since 2007 when she was allowed to take pictures and talk to some of the inmates. Scroll down for video . Death sentence: Scott Peterson was convicted in 2004 of the murder of his wife, Laci, and their unborn son . Inside: Pictures of Scott Peterson, pictured in blue T-shirt, on Death Row have been released by reporter Nancy Mullane who was granted access to the prison . Up close: The door to Peterson's cell, which he lives in alone, bears his picture and prisoner number . Leisure time: Peterson is allowed up to five hours outside every day where he can shoot hoops with other inmates or exercise . Under lock and bolt: The barred and barricaded entrance to the 'condemned row' It was only later that she realized . Peterson - who was convicted of killing his wife and unborn child in . 2004 - was in the pictures. She told Lauer he has been moved . to a more 'prisoner-friendly' wing of death row, where he has his own . cell and is allowed up to five hours a day outside exercising or . shooting hoops. She said: 'He is in a very confined . environment living in this tier of the building which is a more . prisoner-friendly section of death row with 68 other inmates. He has . access to the roof from his tier.' There are three death row sections in the prison - one with maximum security for 'problem prisoners', another generic wing where around 600 inmates live, and the more relaxed tier which Peterson shares with around 70 other convicts. Scott Peterson filed an appeal of his 2004 death sentence to the California Supreme Court in July, . saying, as he has always maintained, that he had nothing to do with the . murders of Laci, his wife, and Conner, the child she was carrying. Peterson's . attorney, noted death penalty lawyer Cliff Gardner, filed the 423-page . document eight years after a San Mateo County jury found the former . fertilizer salesman guilty of suffocating Laci and dumping her in the . San Francisco Bay on Christmas Eve 2002. Home: The convicted murderer has his own cell, identical to those pictured, though Nancy was not allowed access inside . Access: Peterson has been moved to a more 'prisoner-friendly' tier of death row, according to Nancy . Daily life: Scott Peterson is seen walking through the prison door of his tier to go to his cell . Gardner claims that the overwhelming publicity Peterson's trial received, incorrect evidentiary rulings and other mistakes deprived him of a fair trial. The murderer was convicted in 2004 after a trial that his attorney argues surpassed the O.J. Simpson murder trial in terms of publicity. Such was the hype surrounding the trial that it was ordered moved from Stanislaus County of the Petersons' home, to San Mateo County. But Gardner argued that the trial should have been moved yet again because of the crush of publicity in San Mateo County. 'Before hearing even a single . witness, nearly half of all prospective jurors admitted they had already . decided Mr Peterson was guilty of capital murder,' Gardner argues. And in what may be a first for the . American system of justice, outside the courthouse in which the parties . would try to select a fair jury, a radio station posted a large . billboard which had a telephone number for people to call in and vote . 'whether Peterson was a man or monster'. Change: When Peterson was finally arrested, he had dyed his hair blonde and grown a goatee to disguise his appearance . Inmate: Scott Peterson was transported to San Quentin Prison death row after he was formally sentenced to death for the murder or his wife Laci and their unborn son . Resident: The East Block Condemned Row II at San Quentin State Prison in San Quentin California, where Peterson is housed as he awaits his execution . Peterson was pictured in an orange jailhouse jumpsuit. 'The publicity continued throughout . trial,' Gardner argued. 'A mob estimated at more than 1,000 people . gathered at the courthouse to await the guilt phase verdict. 'After the guilty verdict was . announced, the 12 jurors departing to await the beginning of the penalty . phase - and decide whether Mr. Peterson would live or die - were met . with wild applause and cheering.' Beyond issues with the publicity, . Gardner argues the judge made several erroneous evidentiary decisions . and other rulings that led to Peterson receiving an unfair trial. Gardner notes that Peterson was . convicted and sentenced to death even though investigators never . directly proved 'how, where or when' the murder occurred. Prosecutors told the jury that Laci was killed sometime between the night of December 23, 2002 and the following morning. They believed she was suffocated in her home, but Gardner argues that there was little direct evidence collected at the house to support that theory. Peterson claims that Laci was killed . sometime after he left their Modesto home the morning of December 24, . 2002 to go fishing in the San Francisco Bay. Highly publicized: Scott Peterson has always maintained his innocence and claims he did not get a fair trial . Innocent?: Peterson claims that Laci was killed sometime after he left their Modesto home the morning of December 24, 2002 to go fishing in the San Francisco Bay. The fetus was found washed up in San Francisco Bay in April 2003, and the next day Laci's torso was located. Scott had been fishing in the area when she disappeared. A mistress, Amber Frey, came forward and later testified to say she had been having an affair with Peterson but he never told her he was married. Gardner goes on to complain that the judge automatically excluded prospective jurors who said they opposed the death penalty. He argues that those jurors should have been questioned more about whether they could still decide the case fairly. Gardner also claims that some of the prosecution's strongest evidence should never have been shown to the jury. For instance, Gardner alleges that the police dog who picked up Laci's scent at the Berkeley Marina 'even though the dog had a dismal record of being wrong a remarkable 66 per cent of the time.' The thick legal brief delves into numerous other issues alleging incorrect rulings, juror misconduct and other errors. All death penalty cases are appealed to the California Supreme Court, which is struggling to keep up with the pace of cases. There are 725 inmates on Death Row and no prisoner has been executed in California since January 2006. Lawsuits in federal and state courts have temporarily halted executions.The appeal is expected to take months, if not years, to be resolved.

An Oklahoma family has shared the heartbreaking tale of how three of four unrelated daughters-in-law were diagnosed with breast cancer, with one tragically losing her life. Robert and Wilma Wehrenberg had four boys - Mark, Michael, David and Paul. The couple  had wanted a girl but decided their sons' wives would be the daughters they never had. 'And that's what we had - four wonderful daughters-in-law,' Robert told NewsOK.com. Stacy Wehrenberg, Michael's wife, was the first to be diagnosed, in 2010. The couple worked together at the University of Oklahoma and married on New Year's Eve 2002. Not long after, they had their daughter Abbey, who's now 9. Tragic: Stacy Wehrenberg, pictured right, was the first to be diagnosed, in 2010. She lost her battle in 2012. Tammy, pictured left with her husband Paul, was next, however she has now finished treatment . It was around the holidays that doctors told the family Stacy had a type of breast cancer that was fairly simple to treat. In January 2011, they told her they were wrong. It turned out she had a rare form of breast cancer known as metaplastic carcinoma, which is already considered invasive at diagnosis. Doctors removed the tumor but the cancer was aggressive and had already spread through her blood system. Stacy finished her chemotherapy in October 2011 and had two good months, including a happy Thanksgiving that her family will always cherish. Not again: Amy, pictured left, was the last to be diagnosed but is now cancer free . But predictably her cancer came back. In March 2012, she went to the doctor complaining of aches and pains. She was told the cancer had spread through her bones and she was given six months to live. 'I think most doctors agreed that she just really never got over it,' her husband Michael said. Despite . the grim prognosis, Stacy didn't give up. She enrolled in a drug trial . at a cancer center in Houston. But while two patients on the trial made . complete recoveries, Stacy's cancer got worse. Meanwhile, . in April 2012, David's wife, who is also called Stacy, found a lump in . her breast. The couple kept it to themselves at first and later learned . it was not cancer. They . were relieved, but her guilt at being healthy when one, and later two . more Wehrenberg sisters-in-law weren't so lucky, gave her a heavy heart. 'I kept telling her, ""There's a reason — maybe there's a reason. Maybe you need to be the rock,""' David told the news website. Tammy, Paul's wife, was next. After she turned 40, she decided to have her first annual mammogram. Soon it was an ultrasound, a biopsy and then doctors were taking a sample of her breast tissue. 'We . think this is cancer,' the doctors told her. Though hers was in an . early stage - 0 or 1 - the diagnosis got worse and worse, Paul said. After she was told 17 of her lymph nodes were involved, she chose to have a double mastectomy.Michael's wife Stacy was nothing but supportive. 'The . best thing Stacy ever told me when I was diagnosed was ""Just because . I've been given my death sentence doesn't mean you're not allowed to . have your feelings. So don't feel like you can't call me and talk to me . about how you feel,""' Tammy said. 'What a gift. I don't know how she . knew how to say that.' And she did lean on her sister-in-law. Scare: David's wife, right, who is also called Stacy, found a lump in her breast in April 2012 but later learned it was not cancer . In summer 2012, when she was sitting . on her bed with one of her two daughters Allison, Tammy pulled out a . chunk of her hair. She called Stacy, sobbing. Twenty minutes later, she . had got her head shaved. As she suffered the brutal side effects of chemotherapy and recovered from her mastectomy, she was in a great deal of pain. 'It's . very hard on a family,' Paul said. 'It got to where she was hurting so . much, if I would touch her or Della would touch her ... it hurt. It . scared Della. She still has problems in not wanting to hurt her mom.' Meanwhile, . Stacy's cancer had doubled while she was on the drug trial. With little . left that doctors could try, Stacy decided to come home. And she and . Michael, with their family and friends around them, renewed their vows. After almost 10 years of marriage, . they wed again at the McFarlin United Methodist Church in Norman, and at . the reception Stacy danced. 'She had a natural high that whole evening,' David said. 'You wouldn't think she was as sick as she was.' Wedding: After Stacy was given a short time to live, she and Michael, with their family and friends around them, renewed their vows . After . a final family vacation in Disneyland in July, Stacy started losing her . vision and doctors found a tumor behind her eye. They decided to bring . hospice care into their home. She passed away on September 26, 2012, aged 52, surrounded by her family. 'I . never saw her not upbeat,' her father-in-law, Robert told the . newspaper. 'Even though she was so down, she kept it to herself if she . felt bad. She kept cheering us up, too. We wanted to keep her spirits . up, but it wasn't hard to keep her spirits up. She was a special . person.' Just days later, Tammy finished her chemotherapy. She threw a party to celebrate with 60 friends, and toasted her brave sister-in-law. 'It . was still very hard with her not being there because her death was . still very fresh and raw. I still carry that with me,' she said. But the family's battle with breast cancer was not over. Mastectomy: After Tammy, Paul's wife, turned 40, she decided to have her first annual mammogram. Soon it was an ultrasound, a biopsy and then doctors were taking a sample of her breast tissue . On October 10, 2012, Mark's wife Amy went to get a mammogram after discovering a lump on her breast a few months earlier. Her . mother and grandmother had had the disease, and having watched Stacy . and Tammy fight so valiantly, she was understandably scared. On October 17, Mark's birthday, Amy was diagnosed with breast cancer. 'It . was a big surprise to all of us, especially since it was a few weeks . after Stacy's service,' Michael said. 'We're like, ""Three, in the same . family, yet not blood relatives. How does that happen?""' Amy . had eight rounds of chemotherapy over the next few months and opted to . remove the lump, rather than undergo a full mastectomy. She lost her hair, and her children , Matthew and Amanda, cut theirs short to show their support. However, her hair has now grown back. Supportive: Tammy, pictured, said Stacy was nothing but supportive and told her 'Just because I've been given my death sentence doesn't mean you're not allowed to have your feelings' Amy finished her chemotherapy in May, 2012 and radiation in August. 'We're going to say I'm cancer free,' Amy told the news website. Meanwhile, on January 31 this year, Tammy had her last radiation treatment on and doctors told her simply: 'Go live your life.' The Wehrenbergs hope their harrowing story will encourage other women to get regular mammograms and inspire breast cancer sufferers to fight hard for their families. 'If you do get the worst of it, you've just got to fight,' Amy said. 'You've got to take it and fight like a girl because there's not a female who won't fight to the death for her family. You've just got to fight for your life for your family.' Today, three pink ribbons made from wood sit outside Robert and Wilma's home, representing the three 'wonderful daughters-in-law' who, despite only being related through the brothers they married, shared so much more.","Oklahoma women, Stacy, Tammy and Amy Wehrenberg, who are only related by the brothers they married, were all diagnosed with breast cancer .

The previously unknown story of a compassionate WWI nurse who cared for wounded Germans despite her own brother dying on the battlefields has emerged for the first time. Little was known about nurse Margaret Maule until a battered suitcase containing her mementos was discovered at the back of a cupboard at the University of Abertay, in Dundee. Researchers have been able to piece together bits and pieces of her life from photographs, her diary, letters, nursing certificates and an article she had written for a newspaper. Serendipity: The battered case contained a trove of letters, photos and other mementos belonging to Nurse Margaret Maule . But academics at the university are at a loss to explain why the suitcase was hidden away in a cupboard at the university, especially since there is no record of her ever having been there. Researchers are now trying to find the missing links to piece together the full story. Inside the old case, there was an article Nurse Maule had written for a newspaper called The People's Journal and an autograph book filled with sketches and thank you notes from German patients. Thank you rhyme: A poem written in Nurse Maul's book, dated exactly one year after the end of WWI . Nursing life: Inside the case there was a little black book with sketches and notes and an article she had written for a newspaper . Researchers have been slowly piecing together Nurse Maule's life from the plethora of certificates, photographs, books, sketches, letters and articles inside the tatty case . According to the diary she had reservations about treating enemy soldiers as her brother had been killed in action in the spring 1917. Yet despite her misgivings the kind-hearted nurse is known to have tended to injured German prisoners of war during her time at the Dartford War Hospital, in Kent, as well as British soldiers at a hospital in Glasgow. Robin Ion, head of Abertay's Nursing and Counselling Division, is keen to hear from anyone who can shed more light on Nurse Maule. He said: 'The contents of this suitcase are absolutely fascinating, but we know very little about the person who owned it. There's no record of her ever having been to Abertay, so how it came to be in our possession is a complete mystery. Friends, not foes: A letter from a soldier of war reveals how well thought of she was among her patients . Comic: A book of sketches and writings gives an insight into Nurse Maule's light-hearted musings . The team: Nurses treated injured soldiers, British and German, at the hospital in Kent . 'All we know about her is what we've been able to piece together from the things we found in her suitcase. 'It contains documents dating back to 1914, including her diary and an article she wrote for a newspaper called The People's Journal. 'There's also an autograph book filled with detailed sketches drawn for her by her patients by way of thanks for the care she gave them, and a number of faded photographs of her and her fellow nurses dressed in their pristine white uniforms.' This is an important discovery as very little is known about nursing during World War I, at the time a relatively new profession, Mr Ion said. Little is known about nursing during World War I, at the time a relatively new profession . 'She was desperate to do her bit for the war effort. So it came as a shock when she learnt she was to be sent to Dartford to care for prisoners of war. 'The fact that she managed to carry out her duties in spite of her misgivings, and that she did so in such a way that her patients went to the trouble of crafting gifts for her to show their appreciation, indicates that she was one of the best,' he said. 'Nursing has always been about showing compassion without prejudice and Nurse Maule showed an enormous depth of feeling to her patients under very difficult circumstances.' Nurse Maule was part of the Queen Alexandra's Imperial Nursing Service (QAIMNS) was formed in 1902, which replaced the Army Nursing Service, formed in the 1850s to provide care to soldiers injured during the Crimean War. The nurse was born in Paisley in 1887, she went to East Public School and trained as a nurse at Merryflatts Hospital - now the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow - from 1914 to 1917. After the war she worked in the Shakespeare Hospital in Glasgow, before doing further training at the Greenock District Nursing Association in 1919. She was sent a letter of appreciation for her service from the Ministry of Defence when she finally retired after 52 years of service in 1969 aged 82.

Prince Harry is a 'jackal' intent on killing innocent people while 'drunk' in Afghanistan, one of the country's feared warlords has said. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who is listed as one of the world's most wanted terrorists by the United States, launched the verbal attack as the Royal spent . Christmas in the war-torn country. Hekmatyar, who was once prime minister of Afghanistan, said Harry is being 'hunted' by the Taliban and in one assault on a base was forced to 'find a hole to hide himself'. The jihadist also promised that until British 'invaders' leave in 2014 they will be attacked and murdered with even greater intensity. 'Jackal': Prince Harry, who is currently in Afghanistan, has been accused of killing innocent people while drunk, by a notorious warlord . Exiled: From his hideaway on the Afghanistan/Pakistan bordwer Gulbuddin Hekmatyar said the Royal is being hunted . Harry is currently on a four month long deployment to Afghanistan serving his second tour of duty as gunship co-pilot. Hekmatyar also mocked Britain's involvement in the 'cruel conflict' to please 'American generals'. 'The British Prince comes to Afghanistan to kill innocent Afghans while he is drunk. He wants to hunt down Mujaheddin with his helicopter rockets without any shame,' he said in an interview with the Daily Telegraph. 'But he does not understand this simple fact that the hunting of Afghan lions and eagles is not that easy! Jackals cannot hunt lions. 'It seems that some British authorities still dream about the times of the eighteenth and nineteenth century and they want their ambassador to be treated like a viceroy and their prince to go out in uniform to hunt for human beings and play the satanic role that they used to play in the past.' The warlord - who is the founder and leader of the Hezb-e Islami political party and paramilitary group - also referenced the attack on the base where Harry was stationed in October. Speaking from his hideaway on the Afghan/Pakistan border, he added: 'During the Mujaheddin attack on the American base the Prince saw that he was the one about to be hunted and was searching for a hole in which to hide himself.' Solidier: Harry is on his second tour of Afghanistan and flew into Helmand in September . Scathing attack: Hekmatyar, who is branded a terrorist by America, says Harry is being hunted and in one attack was forced to find a hole to hide in . Two American Marines were killed in the attack before Western soldiers led by British troops killed 18 of the attackers and took one prisoner. Gulbidden Hekmatyar was the celebrated and fearsome force credited with ending the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in 1989. However, as one of the most deadly of the . Mujahideen leaders, he was also accused of dedicating himself to 'fighting . other Mujahideen rather than killing Soviets'. At the heart of his political views is that he strongly opposes the presence of foreign troops in his country and that all efforts should be made to remove them by force. He has also adopted extreme Islamist views and was Prime Minister of Afghanistan from 1993 to 1994 and again briefly in 1996. The former PM is accused of being behind an attack that killed 25,000 civilians in the 90s, for example. He later fled to Iran after the Taliban took control of the country. An enemy of current Afghan president Karzai, he lives somewhere near the country's border with Pakistan and has been accused of having links to Bin Laden and al-Qaeda. The Taliban rushed to claim a propaganda victory, saying that Prince Harry, who is an Apache helicopter pilot based at Bastion, was the intended victim of the attack. Qari Youssef Ahmadi, the Taliban’s spokesman, said: 'We attacked that base because Prince Harry was also on it and so they can know our anger. Thousands more suicide attackers are ready to give up their lives for the sake of the Prophet.' Harry’s arrival at Camp Bastion in September, where he will serve with 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment Army Air Corps came four weeks after a storm over his antics in Las Vegas. Pictures emerged of the prince naked during an alcohol-fuelled game of strip billiards in his £5,100-a-night suite at the luxurious Encore Wynn Hotel. Although he was said to be letting off steam ahead of his deployment to Afghanistan, the third-in-line to the throne received a stern dressing-down by senior officers for his role in the frolics. Meanhwhile Hekmatyar, who has been labelled a 'war criminal' by President Hamid Karzai's government in Kabul, has already seen Afghanistan torn apart by fighting after playing an important role during the civil war. But his co-operation and the involvement of his political party is still seen as vital to ensure the acceptance of a new democratically-elected government. Fun: Before his current tour Harry went to Vegas with his friends to let his hair down and got into several scrapes, including a notorious game of naked billiards . Vegas: Prince Harry partied hard on his trip to America, before the public knew he was on the way back to war . But while Hekmatyar has called for a 'peaceful transition of the government' to democracy, he warned that the country faced plunging into anarchy following the withdrawal of British troops in 2014. He remarked that the current situation in Afghanistan resembles the time shortly before the withdrawal of Soviet soldiers in the 1980s. But while he insisted the country may be plunged into chaos following British troops leaving the country, he also insisted withdrawal of 'all foreign forces' before his party would participate in the 2014 presidential elections. The Government has been forced into a response to Hekmatyar's rant. A Ministry of Defence (MoD) spokesman said: 'The suggestion that any member of the UK Armed Forces deployed on operations operates under the influence of alcohol is simply absurd - not least because the consumption of alcohol by UK military personnel is not permitted under any circumstances while deployed in Afghanistan. 'UK troops deployed and remain in Afghanistan to protect our national security by removing what was a safe haven for international terrorism.' 2012: Last year was a big one for the Prince, as he was also a central part of the Jubilee celebrations with his brother William and his wife Kate .

Accompanied by three royal protection officers, the Duchess enjoyed the sun at the Arosa resort where she, her husband and brother-in-law were guests at yesterday’s wedding of London 2012 dressage champion Laura Bechtolsheimer and polo player Mark Tomlinson. She teamed the outfit with black skinny jeans and furry black snow boots, similar to the designer £300 Mukluk boots that Prince Harry bought girlfriend Cressida Bonas during their recent holiday in Verbier last month. The Duchess was also wearing a pair of £159 Givenchy sunglasses. A tourist from Germany, who was walking with his wife, said: ‘She was walking down the hill with three men. She was very sweet and smiled at people who looked at her. She seemed to be taking in the scenery.’ Not far from the Duchess’s hiking trail, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry were spotted skiing with friends around the same time.

Suites at the Tschuggen Grand Hotel cost up to £2,450-a-night and include use of a private 12-seat ski lift to whisk people straight up to the slopes. Guests found skis, poles and ski passes in their rooms – while a traditional wooden toboggan was provided for the pregnant Duchess. While Prince William and Harry went skiing on Friday, Kate - usually a keen skier herself - picked the relatively safer option of sledging with a friend and her baby. Locals said she laughed out loud as she sped down a one-kilometre-long winding slope on the side of the stunning Graubünden mountains.

A self-styled 'party princess' has been jailed for four years, just days before her 21st birthday, after being found guilty of running over and killing a father while drunk. Karlie Tomica sobbed in a Florida court today as she admitted to drinking heavily during a bar tending shift at a nightclub, and then hitting chef Stefano Riccioletti with her car and leaving him to die in the road as she drove home drunk. 'I know my actions shattered the hearts of his wife, his children, his friends and all who knew him,' the 20-year-old said, as she clutched pictures of her victim's children. Scroll down for video . Remorse: Karlie Tomica wept as she admitted to drink driving and killing a father as he walked to work . Tomica's blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit two hours after her arrest in January, according to the Miami Herald. After smashing into her 49-year-old victim, the student drove away and ignored a witness who tried to flag her down. When police arrested her in her 17th floor condo, Tomica had bits of her victim's brain and flesh in her hair. In a statement that reduced the courtroom to tears, Tomica said: 'If my drinking at work and becoming . drunk was not bad enough, killing Mr Stefano and driving away and . leaving him to die was inexcusable.' She added: 'I know my actions shattered the hearts . of his wife, his children, his friends and all who knew him ... I broke the hearts of my parents.' The former Florida International University student accepted a guilty plea to charges including DUI manslaugher and leaving the scene of a fatal accident. Jailed: Tomica hugs her younger sister as she is sentenced to four years in prison . Loss: Stefano Riccioletti was the executive chef at The Shore Club's Terrazza . The timing of the deal, just days before she turned 21, means Tomica will be treated as a youth offender, according to CBS Miami. She will serve four years in prison, two years under house arrest and 15 years on probation. Her driver's license was revoked for the rest of her life and a judge ordered the 20-year-old to complete more than 1,000 hours of community service and speak to students five times a year about how she killed Mr Riccioletti. The family of the victim, who had three children aged 19, 12 and nine, is suing the Nikki Beach bar where Tomica had been working for negligence, in allowing an underage employee to drink. The victim's wife, Patrizia Pesce, gave Tomica pictures of the couple's children as she explained in court the devastating effect losing their father had on them. Their father, executive chef Mr Riccioletti, had been on his way to work when he was hit. A witness described how the impact sent his body flying through the air, before it landed in the driveway of a hotel. Plea: Patrizia Pesce, right, the widow of Tomica's victim, listens as the 20-year-old admits she had been drinking heavily . Guilty: Karlie Tomica, pictured left on her Twitter profile and right, . in her booking photo, was found guilty of charges including DUI manslaughter and leaving the scene of a fatal accident .

Tomica could have faced more than 50 years in prison, but the widow of her victim intervened, saying her husband would not have wanted revenge, according to the Miami Herald. Patrizia Pesce told her: 'He was a big believer in second chances. What will you do with this opportunity? Will you waste it or will you dedicate your life to improving the lives of others, not destroying them?' Loving father: Stefano Riccioletti is pictured with his wife and two of his three children .

Her mother Denise says she was was moved between five hospitals in just eight months and in that time her weight plummeted further still to just four stone and 10lbs. Shocking: Sian Clarke at a healthy weight (left), before the ravages of Anorexia left her weighing under five stone. Sian in one of the five hospitals she was treated in (right). Her mother says the NHS 'left her to die' The 40 year-old hairdresser said: : 'She was left to die. 'She was passed between five hospitals in eight months, and none of them could treat her anorexia. 'The doctors told me that she was on the brink of death.' Sian was first admitted to a hospital in Birmingham, then moved to Ealing, London. Doctors . then decided that Sian would be better suited to psychiatric support, . so she was transferred to secure psychiatric unit at the Cygnet Hospital . in Bradford, where violent patients were also being treated. Hug: Sian, pictured with her elder brother Dan, 22. She was sectioned in October for her anorexia but her weight has continued to fall in the last eight months . She was then transferred to a hospital in Derby, but returned to Bradford due to lack of funding. On Tuesday she was transferred back to the Cygnet Hospital in Derby - a move which her family says saved her life. He mother said: 'It's no joke to say that I would be planning her funeral now if she hadn't finally made it to the centre in Derby. It's shocking, and I'm absolutely appalled. 'The NHS has got a lot to answer for. This is somebody's life. Everyone seems to blame someone else. 'Someone has to be responsible for what has happened. When I visited her in the psychiatric unit in Bradford, it would take all my strength to fight back the tears. 'She felt like she is being punished, that no one is listening to her.' Sian's struggle with weight loss began when she was 15 years old. She was bullied at college and stopped eating. A year later she received treatment at a hospital in Stafford and made a good recovery. But Sian's problems resurfaced and by October she had lost half her body weight. She has now made a desperate plea for better services to treat mental health patients as she battles to stay alive. Speaking . from her hospital bed, she said: 'I am still a human being and I should . be allowed to have a say in what is best for me. This is putting a huge . strain on me and my family - financially and emotionally. 'People . need to start listening to patients with mental health problems. Nurses . are supposed to be helping people but they are becoming so clogged up . with paper work - there is no care.' Mrs Clarke said Sian was awas a 'lovely and bubbly girl' growing up but started to lose weight after getting bullied at school. 'She would skip meals, or eat very little and throw the rest away. 'I didn't know it at the time, but she was sneakily doing exercises in the middle of the night in her bedroom. 'Eventually someone at school realised that something was very wrong, and she was referred for help.' Family: Sian (right) with her mother Denise, who has blasted the level of care her daughter has received . She said she has felt helpless trying to get the appropriate care for Sian, especially while she was in Bradford. Travelling to and from the different health units has also placed a financial strain on the family. 'All the staff at Bradford were lovely to Sian, but they didn't have the facilities to cope with her anorexia,' she said. 'All they could do there was keep her safe, but she wasn't getting the treatment she needed. 'She would be given meals and be left to get on with it. The ward didn't have to resources or skills to help her. 'She was on a secure ward with very unwell patients who would be very loud and often violent. 'There were panic alarms going off all night and she could barely sleep. Because she was so small and petite, the other patients seemed to target her and she ended up with a few bruises. 'It was quite terrifying for her, and there was no way she could begin her recovery in that environment. 'It's appalling how Sian has been treated. She should be on the road to recovery by now. 'She would phone me screaming in fear, and she had a few run-ins with other patients. 'It's a big relief that she is finally in somewhere that can help her.' Karen Helliwell, director of commissioning at the Birmingham, Solihull and Black Country Area Team (NHS England) who are responsible for providing care for Sian, said they worked hard to ensure the best decisions were made. 'In exceptional cases where a condition becomes complicated by additional diagnoses, a different type of service may be appropriate for the patient. 'We work hard to ensure that this process is undertaken in a timely manner, however a careful balance has to be found to ensure that elements such as patient choice and clinical needs are taken into account.'","Sian Clarke, 19,  is fighting to survive after her weight plunged .

"By . Nick Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 16:33 EST, 9 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:32 EST, 25 September 2013 . Wind farms are being given around £30million a year in compensation to switch off or slow down their turbines because up to half the electricity they make is not needed. The cash, which comes from household bills, is paid when the National Grid is unable to cope with the extra power produced during high winds or periods of low demand. Known as ‘balancing’, the arrangement is intended to compensate firms for energy they are unable to sell. Waste of energy: Last weekend up to 30 wind farms were paid more than three million to switch off their turbines . But as the number of wind farms grows, the rates have hit record levels. Firms are often paid more to turn off their giant turbines than for the electricity they produce. Last weekend alone, householders handed £3.1million to energy firms for doing absolutely nothing as up to 30 wind farms were paid to switch off. The energy that could have been produced between Friday and Sunday would have powered up to 12,000 homes for a year. At one point, 40 per cent of all the wind energy set to be transmitted to the National Grid was instead discarded, with the loss being blamed on maintenance work and breezy conditions. More than 95 per cent of payments to energy firms last Saturday were to constrain energy produced by wind farms in Scotland because there is limited network capacity between Scotland and the rest of Britain creating a bottleneck of supply. Weekend of waste: The energy that could have been produced over three days by the unused wind turbines would have powered up to 12,000 homes for a year . The amount of wind energy discarded that day was almost twice as much as any other day on record, and cost families £1.9million. It was one of three days since May when wind farms were told to cut their output by more than a third. On June 30, 46 per cent of energy from turbines was constrained. In total, payments worth almost £15million have been made this year – more than double the amount given in all of 2012. If the trend continues, the bill for the year will be around £30million. The figures only relate to giant turbines connected to the national distribution network, which make up 70 per cent of wind power. There are 5,000 giant turbines across the country, with another 1,000 planned. Under EU law, Britain’s energy consumption from renewables needs to reach 15 per cent by 2020. Payments known as ‘forward trades’ are also made to energy operators by the National Grid. This is where it agrees a payout in advance when the weather is expected to be stormy. In 2011, £18.6million was paid in forward trades, although the figure is likely to be much lower this year. Both payments make up about 1 per cent of a typical household’s electricity spend, according to National Grid. A spokesman said costs were being driven down and the energy lost last weekend was ‘slightly above average’ owing to a combination of planned summer maintenance and high winds. But Dr John Constable, director of the Renewable Energy Foundation, said: ‘The increasing volume of discarded wind energy presents a very strong case for revising UK’s ambitious commitment to EU green targets. Allowing subsidised generators to name their price to stop causing problems is a lousy solution. Expensive energy: Over the first six months of 2013, energy companies have been paid almost £15million to slow down or turn off their wind turbines when the National Grid has been unable to cope . ‘They are abusing their position by holding a pistol to the head of Government and effectively saying we will not get off the grid unless you pay handsomely. Ofgem must do something about this. ‘It’s already a record year and it’s set to be a bumper one looking at the costs. We are on track to spend more on constraining wind than all of the previous years combined. And the problem just seems set to be getting worse.’ Generous taxpayer-funded subsidies for wind farms are set to continue until at least 2020. Onshore wind farms have been guaranteed at least £100 per megawatt hour, which is a unit of energy equal to using a million watts of power in one hour. This is double the current wholesale rate of £50. Offshore wind farms receive £150. Last weekend, two Scottish windfarms charged £200 per megawatt hour to shut off. With greater wind production becoming available all the time, experts warn the overall cost of these payments is set to rise. Energy analyst Mulu Sun said the spikes in constraint payments may be partly due to a lack of capacity, adding: ‘National Grid’s infrastructure should be keeping pace with the building of wind farms, but that is not necessarily the case.

Joss Stone was having a ‘really nice day’ until she discovered two men had been planning to kidnap and kill her, she told a court yesterday. The 25-year-old singer had no inkling of the alleged plot to decapitate her with a samurai sword and would sleep at her country house with the doors unlocked and the burglar alarm switched off, the jury heard. But as she stood smartly dressed in the witness box yesterday, Miss Stone said it was ‘creepy’ that people openly discussed her whereabouts. Evidence: Joss Stone leaves Exeter Crown Court today after telling the jury she had no idea of an alleged plot to kill her . Joss Stone leaves Exeter Crown Court where Junior Bradshaw and Kevin Liverpool are on trial for the attempted kidnapping and murder of the soul singer . Security: Joss Stone (court sketch) discussed the security arrangements at her Devon home during her appearance at Exeter Crown Court today . On the day that two men were arrested a few miles from her Devon home after ‘eagle-eyed’ local residents contacted the police, the singer had been spending time with her then boyfriend, builder Daniel Radford, as a break from her international jet-setting lifestyle. Asked if she had any reason to feel threatened at the time of the alleged murder plot, she replied: ‘Apart from the police coming around to say someone was trying to kidnap and kill me, it was a really nice day.’ She continued: ‘The police came round about midday and said these people were trying to kidnap me. ‘In the afternoon of the same day they came back and said, no, no, they are trying to kill me. That was strange.’ Miss Stone told the court she never kept more than £1,000 in cash at her house and did not have a safe. Explaining her attitude to security at her £500,000 home prior to the arrests, she said: ‘I had an alarm but I did not really turn it on very much. I didn’t really have a lock on my door which I could shut. But I do now.’ Court appearance: Joss Stone being questioned by Simon Morgan QC as Junior Bradshaw (left) and Kevin Liverpool (right) watch on in front of Judge Francis Gilbert QC . Junior Bradshaw, left, and Kevin Liverpool, right are on trial accused of plotting to rob and murder Joss Stone . The pop star, who grew up in the county, . added: ‘I’ve lived in Devon for a long time and nobody really shuts . their doors around here.’ But she went on: ‘Now I do it. I turn the . alarm on and I shut my windows at night.’ Miss Stone did not look at Kevin Liverpool or Junior Bradshaw, the two . men charged with plotting to kill her, while she gave evidence at their . trial for just over 30 minutes yesterday. Clasping her hands together as she spoke, she occasionally giggled as . the court was shown a six-minute film of her appearing in the MTV . programme Cribs. In the episode, which the defendants are said to have . viewed for ‘research’, she is seen guiding a camera crew around her . previous Devon home, pointing out a blue toilet seat and her . purple-themed bedroom. She was also seen making a rude gesture to the camera and swearing during the 2008 broadcast. The court has previously heard that Liverpool, 35, and Bradshaw, 32, . were arrested a few miles from Miss Stone’s home with an arsenal of . weapons – including a samurai sword – in their £440 Fiat Punto. The jury . has been told they were armed with the sword as well as a knife and . hammers, and had gaffer tape, masks and plastic bags. Tour diary: Joss Stone told the court would not expect her private diary to have ended up on the internet . Notes found by police refer to decapitating the singer and dumping her . body in a river, and express disapproval of her links to the Royal . Family, it has been claimed. Bradshaw and Liverpool, both from Manchester, deny charges of conspiring . to rob, murder and cause grievous bodily harm to Miss Stone, who was . referred to in court yesterday by her real name, Jocelyn Eve Stoker. Asked how she came to be a guest at the wedding of Prince William and . Kate Middleton, she told the court: ‘I guess I was invited because I . sang for them a couple of times. Once for Princess Diana’s concert a . while ago and there was another charity event I did for Harry. I guess . they just invited me because they thought it would be nice to invite me – . so I went.’ The jury was also shown extracts from the singer’s work schedule, which . included trips before and after the arrests to Los Angeles, New York, . Barcelona, Paris and Dublin. Miss Stone said her home, accessed through gates on a country lane, was . something of an ‘open house’ but added that she has increased her . security since the arrests on the morning of June 13, 2011. Asked by Martin Meeke QC, representing Bradshaw, if her diary was . available on the internet, she laughed as she replied: ‘No, I’d hope . not. That wouldn’t be good.’ She continued: ‘If someone wanted to know where I was going to be they . would have to ask somebody who knows. That could be somebody in the . band, the crew or someone who saw me in the shop.’ She added: ‘People talk. Someone might say they’d seen me going to the Co-op. That’s the creepy thing.’ Earlier the jury heard how the alleged plotters tried to acquire . semi-automatic weapons before driving to Devon. Text messages found on . one of their phones showed they had asked contacts in Manchester to . secure them a car and ‘a piece’, slang for a gun, as well as hi-tech . weaponry including infrared kit and a silencer.

The man accused of the murder of Pc Keith Blakelock in the 1985 Broadwater Farm riots has been pictured holding a sign protesting his innocence. The picture of Nicholas Jacobs, 44, was released just days after appearing in court charged with the murder of the officer, who was stabbed as he tried to protect firefighters as they tackled a blaze at a supermarket during the height of the unrest in Tottenham, north London 28 years ago. The poster, which has some spelling errors, reads: 'I did not murder PC Blakelock. I was not there when PC Blakelock was murderd. I don’t know who murderd PC Blakelock. I’m innocent.' Nicholas Jacobs was pictured with a sign denying the murder of the police officer in 1985 . Pc Keith Blakelock was attacked and stabbed dozens of times as he tried to protect firefighters . Wearing a grey tracksuit, bearded Jacobs spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth . It was released by a campaigner the day after Jacobs, who was just 16 at the time of the killing, appeared at a short hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court. He was remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on Friday. Pc Blakelock, 40, was set upon by a mob armed with machetes and stabbed dozens of times in Tottenham, north London as he tried to protect firefighters tackling a blaze at a supermarket. It is claimed the policeman stumbled and was surrounded by a mob screaming, 'kill the pig'. He was knifed 42 times and it is believed his attackers tried to decapitate him in order to display his head on a pole in a gruesome taunt to other officers. Aftermath: The Broadwater Farm riot occurred in Tottenham, North, causing substantial damage to the residential area . Pc Blakelock had been sent down to the Broadwater Farm Estate with fellow officer PC Richard Coombes, and were trying to help firefighters who were tackling a blaze . Keith Blakelock's widow Elizabeth Johnson laid a wreath at a 2010 service on Muswell Hill Roundabout where the officer worked . The father-of-three was eventually dragged away by colleagues, but he died later that evening in North Middlesex Hospital on October 6 1985.

Pc Coombes also suffered serious injuries and never returned to duty.

Officers had stopped her son, Floyd Jarrett, 24, to inspect his car’s tax disc. He was charged with theft and assault at a Tottenham police station, but later cleared of both counts. Cynthia Jarrett’s death sparked violent unrest and accusations of police race discrimination. It plunged the country's race relations into crisis. Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle adjourned the case and Jacobs was remanded in custody. Jacobs will appear at the Old Bailey on July 26 for a first hearing and a preliminary hearing will be held on August 1 also at the Old Bailey.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 08:50 EST, 13 October 2013 . The 12-year-old daughter of a disgraced Utah doctor accused of murdering his wife in 2007 is waiting for a judge to decide if she would be allowed to take the stand against her father. Martin MacNeill, 58, is expected to go on trial next week for allegedly killing his wife by making her overdose on medications so he could pursue a relationship with his younger mistress. Michele MacNeill, 50, was discovered drowned in a bathtub by her 12-year-old daughter, Ada, in the family's home in April 2007. Family divided: Ada MacNeill (left), 12, is waiting for a judge to decide if she would be allowed to take the stand against her father, Martin MacNeill (right), who is accused of murdering his wife in 2007 . Objection: MacNeill's attorney, Susanne Gustin (left), argued that Ada should not be allowed to testify because the prosecution had allowed the girl's older sister to interview her about the killing . Imperfect couple: Ada MacNeill recalled that her father, pictured here with his wife at a happier time, told her to go check on her mother the day she died . Mr MacNeill, a once-prominent physician and Mormon Sunday school teacher, was arrested in September 2012 and charged with first-degree murder. With the trial just days away, MacNeill's attorney, Susanne Gustin, argued Tuesday that her client's youngest daughter should not be allowed as a witness in the trial, ABC News reported. Gustin argued that the teen's testimony would be tainted because the prosecution allowed the girl's older sister to interview her about the killing. Deputy Utah County Attorney Chad Grunander responded to the charge by insisting that there is no evidence to suggest that Ada had been swayed by her two older sisters, who have long held the belief that MacNeill murdered their mother. 'I think he drugged my mother and drowned her,' MacNeill's daughter Alexis Somers said in 2012. 'It's been horrifying, and horrifying that we had to wait for this day so long.' Judge Derek Pullan called the prosecution’s decision to allow Somers to question her sister, who was 6 years old at the time, rather than using an independent expert, ‘troubling,’ according to the Salt Lake Tribune. MacNeill's daughters Alexis Somers and Rachel MacNeill will testify against their father, whom they have long believed to be responsible for their mother's death . Safe haven: Michele MacNeill was found floating fully clothed in a tub in the family's home in Pleasant Grove, Utah, in April 2007 . Somers and her sister Rachel MacNeill will testify for the prosecution. The defendant’s alleged mistress, Gypsy Willis, is also expected to take the stand. Martin MacNeill was released from a Texas federal prison last year after serving three years for fraud. On Tuesday, Judge Pullan ruled that two of his former cellmates and another inmate from a Utah prison would be allowed to testify in the upcoming trial. According to Alexis Somers, Ada had told her that on April 11, 2007, their father had instructed her to go check on her mother in the bathroom while he remained in the kitchen. The girl walked into the room and found Michele MacNeill unconscious in the tub. The 50-year-old woman was fully clothed in a blue jogging suit and had her eyes open. The prosecution believes that the 58-year-old Mormon patriarch gave his wife a dangerous cocktail of sleeping pills, painkillers and anxiety medications while she was recovering from a facelift he had allegedly forced her to have. Martin MacNeill has denied that he had anything to do with his wife's death, telling investigators that Michele drowned and he called 911. The jury selection phase will begin Tuesday, and the trial is expected to last about five weeks. Look of love: Gypsy Willis passes Martin MacNeill, a doctor accused of murdering his wife, after testifying against him on Wednesday. They had an affair for more than a year before the death . During a preliminary hearing last year, Gypsy Willis revealed to the court that she met Martin MacNeill online in 2005 and for the first time in person that . November, before beginning a sexual relationship in January 2006, the Deseret News reported. Yet when they began their relationship, she did not see it having a future, she said. 'It was just for fun,' Willis said. 'It was whenever we could get together. It was just friendly.' As they continued their relationship, she continued to see other men and never considered there was any chance that MacNeill would leave his wife for her, she said. 'He had great respect and love for Michele,' she said. 'He said he had a family and was very happy.' She moved into a duplex that MacNeill owned and provided her with an unlimited credit card to help her get through nursing school, she said. She used it for gas, groceries and coffee. Fall from grace: MacNeill, pictured speaking with his defense lawyer Susanne Gustin, moved Willis into his family home as his children's nanny weeks after the death of his wife . After the death of Michele MacNeill, which was initially ruled as natural causes, the circumstances of their . relationship changed and Willis said she and her lover began talking . about a future together. 'Martin told me he felt very sorry we . had been involved prior to Michele's death,' she said. 'He was embarrassed about . that. He wanted me to come help him and support him.' Unhappy marriage: Martin MacNeill, left, allegedly gave his wife Michele, right, a cocktail of lethal drugs as she recovered from a face lift. She was found drowned in the bathtub eight days after the operation . Heartbroken: Rachael MacNeill, one of MacNeill's daughters, testified that her father took her to a temple to pray for a nanny before 'bumping' into Willis, who he pretended not to know . After the death of his wife, MacNeill and Willis were convicted of identity fraud and served years in prison for stealing . the identity of MacNeill's 16-year-old adopted daughter. When she left federal prison, Willis was convicted on a state charge but prosecutors agreed not to seek extra jail time - provided she testified against her lover. Yet defense attorney Randy Spencer said he thinks the testimony did little to help their case. Fraud: Martin MacNeill (left) and Willis (right) were convicted of thieving the identity of one of his daughters. In exchange for reduced prison time, Willis agreed to testify in the murder trial . Big family: MacNeill, a doctor and Mormon Sunday school teacher, adopted four children with his wife . 'Mr. MacNeill has done a lot . of bad things in his life,' he said. 'Just because you're a bad man, however, does . not make you a murderer.' While . they were imprisoned, the couple wrote to each other and planned to . make a future but now, 'quite honestly, we have both lost everything', . she said. After the murder, the MacNeill . children fought relentless for police to re-open the case into their . mother's death, certain their father had killed her. An autopsy indicated she died of . natural causes, but a 2010 addendum to that report questioned the manner . of death and authorities . now believe she was drugged by her husband. The unravelling of the MacNeill family . began in 2005 when her father started losing weight, tanning and acting . strangely, even disappearing for days at a time. Stunning: MacNeill allegedly forced his wife Michele, pictured, into having a facelift and gave her a lethal mix of drugs as she was recovering. He found her dead in the bathtub of their home . Doting: Michele was described as a loving mother who did everything for her children and her husband . In 2007, Michele became convinced her husband was . having an affair after she found out the same number had been called over . and over again at strange hours of the morning. A few days later, MacNeill came to his wife with a strange request: He wanted her to have a facelift. Two weeks later, she had the surgery and was back at home recovering with Valium, Percocet, Phenergan and Ambien pills, supplied by her husband. A . few days later, as she struggled with her recovery, she told her daughter: 'In case anything happens to me, . make sure it was not your father.' Michele was found dead in the bathtub just eight days after the surgery. MacNeill . claimed his wife slipped and fell, and he discovered her on returning home from collecting his then six-year-old daughter. 'Killed': Prosecutors say MacNeill did not give his wife CPR, as he had claimed, and purposefully gave the 911 dispatcher the wrong address to further delay emergency responders . In a series of frantic 911 calls, he hung up on the . operator three times in five minutes. He lied to the dispatcher about performing CPR . and gave the wrong address of his residence, which delayed emergency . responders, prosecutors claim. According to an affidavit, Utah State Medical Examiner Todd Grey said the . combination of medicines found in her body, which may have been forced . upon her and could have been lethal. 'When . my father called I knew he'd killed her,' Alexis Somers said. 'I just started screaming he killed her. My father planned . and orchestrated my mother's death and thought he could get away . with it.' Family members have said . they suspect Willis was also involved in Michele MacNeill's death, but . she has not been charged in the case.","Martin MacNeill, 58, is accused of giving his wife a cocktail of pain and anxiety medications before she was found drowned at their home' in 2007 .

It was the craze that saw customers sleep outside a New York bakery to be first in line outside the shop this summer. Skirmishes broke out when those who had been queuing were unable to get their hands on dwindling supplies of precious cronuts, the flaky, fried treat that is half-doughnut, half-croissant.. Britain has since embraced the cronut madness and seen the birth of the Greggsnut - Gregg's own limited edition version of the doughnut-croissant hybrid, which was such as success it is to be rolled out nationwide. Now, Waitrose has hopped on the doughnut-blend bandwagon and come up with its own flaky, fried treat: the yumdough, a yum yum-doughnut hybrid. Yumdoughs are topped with sugar icing with pockets of filling and fondant and comes in four flavours . Made from 144-layer dough, the treat is light and airy with a textured effect. It is topped . with sugar icing with pockets of filling and fondant, and comes in four flavours: chocolate and orange; lemon; butterscotch and raspberry and vanilla. Arriving today, the yumdough will be sold in 40 Waitrose branches for £1.49. There is an introductory offer of 25 per cent off. The original Cronut was a croissant-doughnut pastry attributed to chef Dominique Ansel of the  Dominique Ansel Bakery in New York City. The recipe took two months and ten recipes to perfect. In May 2013, the bakery trademarked the name . It took America by storm and spawned a bakery black market as demand outstripped supply. To the delight of everyone on this side of the Atlantic, British bakers soon came up with their own take on the treat. The Greggsnut, which comes in two flavours, berry or caramel-pecan, is made using a similar method - layers of pastry formed into a doughnut shape, fried, iced, and filled with either berry cream or caramel. The Greggsnut came in two flavours, berry or caramel-pecan and was made using a similar method to cronut .

'Our customers will love this delicious combination of two of their favourite sweet treats on the bakery counter,' says Tim Stevens, bakery buyer at Waitrose.

Apple, said it had launched a 'thorough . investigation', adding: 'We are deeply saddened to learn of this tragic . incident and offer our condolences to the family. Apple's mobile gadgets have a generally good safety record with few serious defects reported since the first generation iPhone was launched in 2007. However, as smartphones become more powerful, with larger batteries needing more electricity to power them, there have been growing reports of dangerous malfunctions that have dogged the firm in recent years. February 2013 - Marketing manager Shibani Bhujle, from New York, claimed the battery of her iPhone 4S spontaneously melted, oozing acid that destroyed the handset. January 2013 - An Oregon fire crew blamed an apartment blaze on an overheated MacBook battery which dropped onto a mattress. December 2011 - An iPhone 4 reportedly began . emitting smoke in a plane cabin on a flight to Australia. December 2011 - It was reported that an iPhone 4 was . plugged in to charge overnight in Brazil when it began to emit smoke and sparks as . its owner slept nearby.

In 2010, a man in northeast China . was killed by an electric shock when making a phone call with a handset . that was being recharged with an unauthorized charger, according to the . China Consumers Association. In 2008 a . 3G owner claimed his phone overheated in his pocket and burned his leg . while he was asleep. But Apple is not the only smartphone maker to have come under fire for faulty gadgets. Just last week, a Swiss teenager suffered second and third degree burns when her Samsung Galaxy S3 apparently exploded in her pocket. In May, a Reddit user posted pictures on the site of his charred Galaxy S3, claiming he was 'awoken by a loud noise and a . weird squeaking sound' to find it smouldering by the side of his bed. 'We will fully investigate and co-operate with authorities in this matter.' China’s popular social media chat . sites, called Weibos, were flooded with posts urging fellow iPhone users . not to make calls while charging their phones. And many warned to only use original chargers and avoid plugging in cheap copy chargers which are widely available. 'Be sure to select only qualified, certifiable  products -  the best is the original because safety is most assured. Don’t buy fake chargers!' warned poster Zhao Chao. Apple products are  popular in China but new items are quickly cloned by the country’s infamous copy merchants who produce look-a-like fake phones, laptops, iPads and iPods, which are often hard to distinguish from originals. Mobile phones have a relatively low . electrical output of between 3 to 5 volts - much less than the 36 volts . it takes for a person to feel a shock. But experts say if the charger or the circuit has a problem, such as a broken wire, it can lead to a shock of 220 volts. Johnny Sin Kin-on, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, told the South China Morning Post: 'There is a risk using an electrical device while its installed battery is being charged, be it a shaver or a phone.'

Tesco revealed a plunge in profits yesterday following a year in which tens of thousands of customers switched to budget or high-end rivals. Many households hit by the rising cost of living defected to Aldi and Lidl, while others switched to Waitrose, Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury’s, which have created the perception they offer better quality. Profits at Tesco for the first half of 2013 were £1.39billion, which was down by 24.5 per cent on the same period last year. Not being used: Tesco's trolleys aren't being snapped up as much with loyal customers defecting elsewhere . The UK’s biggest retailer is fighting back by spending £1billion on a rescue plan, which involves store makeovers, new food lines and extra staff. Tesco revealed that its underlying sales in Britain during the first six months of 2012 were down by 0.5 per cent compared with a year ago. Separately, profits from its  European stores slumped sharply and the company reported weaker sales in a number of its Asian markets. The gloomy figures led to shares falling four per cent in early trading, wiping millions off its stock market value. Tesco, which takes £3 in every £10 spent in the nation’s supermarkets, carries enormous financial muscle, however, the cost of living crisis and the pressure from rivals have hit its market share. Competition: Tesco CEO Philip Clarke (left) is falling behind his rival Sainsbury's, run by Justin King (right) Budget: Cut-price Aldi has also claimed some of the supermarket's shoppers with a new luxury line . It has also faced negative fall-out from its role in the horsemeat food fraud scandal involving its value  frozen beef burgers. The picture is very different at Aldi, which has just announced a 40 per cent surge in annual sales with an extra one million customers a week. And yesterday Sainsbury’s announced a 2 per cent rise in underlying sales. Tesco’s management has embarked on a radical overhaul of the business, which has included scrapping plans for 100 new large stores and concentrating on smaller convenience outlets and its website. It has sold its struggling US chain Fresh & Easy and yesterday announced a merger of its Chinese business with China’s largest  grocer Vanguard. Retail analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, Jon Copestake, said: ‘Consumer austerity and the rise of discounters along with greater competition from other mid-market retailers have all weighed on Tesco’s recent performance. ‘It seems that domestically the UK’s largest retailer is continuing to lose out to discounters on price and to peers such as Sainsbury’s on perceived quality.’ Phil Dorrell, director of consultants Retail Remedy, said: ‘The  biggest retailer in the UK is having a truly terrible time.’ John Ibbotson, director of retail consultants Retail Vision, said: ‘With profits nose-diving in Europe and Asia, the foreign markets that once provided a perfect hedge against weak demand at home are now more hurdle than help.’ George Scott, an analyst at retail consultancy Conlumino, said there was intense price rivalry among the ‘big four’ chains and discounters Aldi and Lidl. In addition, there was ‘the growing impetus of Waitrose, which has successfully bridged the value-quality spectrum’, he added. Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke insisted there are reasons for optimism, with higher sales in recent weeks. Underlying food sales in the UK were up by 1 per cent in the last three months compared with a year ago, clothing sales by 8.6 per cent and online grocery sales by 13 per cent. ‘We’re feeling very positive about the changes that we’ve made and consumers are reacting very well,’ he said. It is relaunching its premium  Finest range next week, while its cheap £119 Hudl tablet hit shelves last week with the aim of boosting online sales.","Some loyal shoppers defected to upmarket Waitrose, others to cut-price Aldi .

A man on trial in the slaying of Washington Redskins star safety Sean Taylor admitted to breaking into the NFL player's home, kicking down the bedroom door and shooting Taylor, and drew a detailed diagram of the house, labeling himself as the shooter, according to a videotaped confession played for the jury Thursday. Defendant Eric Rivera Jr wasn't handcuffed but came willingly to talk to authorities in Fort Myers in November 2007, a Miami-Dade police detective testified. At first, the now 23-year-old told investigators he stayed home all weekend and maybe caught a movie with his girlfriend. As authorities pressed, he said he had a bad memory and that everything was foggy, said lead investigator Juan Segovia. When authorities walked another defendant by the room where Rivera was being questioned, Rivera grew noticeably anxious, Segovia said. He refused to make eye contact and kept rubbing his hands together. One of the detectives gave a moving speech, saying Taylor was an American hero who was doing nothing wrong but was at home sleeping with his baby and girlfriend when he was killed, Segovia said. Scroll down for video . Confession: Washington Redskins safety Sean Taylor was murdered in November 2007 when a group of teenagers broke into his Florida home. Eric Rivera's confession to killing Taylor was aired in court today . Admission: Suspect Eric Rivera pictured in court today. Since Rivera was 17 at the time of the killing, the maximum sentence for his crime is life in prison and not the death penalty . That's when Rivera's eyes grew teary and he nodded that he had been involved. Rivera and four co-defendants heard Taylor liked to keep a lot of cash around the house, maybe as much as $200,000. They thought Taylor would be with the Redskins at a game at Tampa Bay the night they broke into his house - but instead he was home with a knee injury, the detective said Rivera told him. An American hero: One prosecutor described Taylor as an American hero who was innocently sleeping with his girlfriend and their baby when he was killed . The plan was to 'go in and get the money and leave,' Rivera said in a videotaped confession played for the jury. Rivera admitted driving the black SUV, parking in front of Taylor's home, hopping a concrete wall and using a crowbar to break into a back patio door. As they searched the home for money, they heard a noise, got spooked and ran back to the car. When they re-entered, Rivera said he kicked in Taylor's bedroom door. 'He was like 2 feet away, got something in his hand and that's when I shot,' he said. Rivera . told detectives he didn't think anyone would be home and didn't realize . Taylor was the one he'd shot. In the video, Rivera, who has long hair . and is seated next to an American flag, shows little emotion and often . gives one-word answers. Jackie . Garcia, Taylor's girlfriend, who was also inside the bedroom, became . noticeably upset as the detective recounted details of the slaying and . rested her head on her knees in court. She sat near several members of . Taylor's family, including his father, Florida City Police Chief Pedro . Taylor, in the packed Miami-Dade County courtroom. Emotional: Sean Taylor's girlfriend, Jackie Garcia Haley, reacts during testimony at the murder trial of Eric Rivera in Miami-Dade Circuit Court in Miami earlier this week . Taylor was shot in the upper thigh, which severed his femoral artery. The former University of Miami star had a machete in his hand, and Garcia and their infant daughter were also in the bedroom, though they were not hurt. Taylor died the next day from massive blood loss. The 24-year-old was a Pro Bowl safety for the Redskins who had previously been a popular, locally grown star at the University of Miami. No remorse? Eric Rivera Jr is pictured smiling in court today, despite the airing of his confession to murder . 'He knew he hit him in the area of the leg. He said the victim fell very rapidly and very hard,' Segovia said. After the shooting, Rivera said he shot through a glass door so he could escape quickly. The group jumped back into the SUV and as they drove across an interstate known as Alligator Alley, they wiped off the gun, stuffed it into a sock and threw it into the Everglades, according to the confession. Rivera said he burned his clothes on the way home. The validity of a detailed, videotaped confession is the central question for jurors to decide in the first-degree murder trial. The video shows Rivera waiving his rights to an attorney and to remain silent. The detective also said Rivera turned down an offer to call his parents several times. Rivera drew diagrams of the rooms and where everyone was at the time, labeling himself as a stick figure that shot Taylor, the detective said. He also said he was wearing the Nike Shox when he kicked in the door and seemed amused when investigators showed him a footprint lifted from the door, Segovia testified. Rivera's attorney, Janese Caruthers, countered that Rivera was coerced into the confession by a team of investigators who had little evidence and was looking for someone to take the fall in a high-pressure case. The defense also noted detectives didn't have any fingerprints, DNA or gunshot residue linking Rivera to the crime. Rivera was brought in after being pulled over during a traffic stop. After the teen confessed, police called his father who came to the station. But Segovia said Rivera 'was very open, very relaxed. ... He was eager to talk to us' and was given an hour-long pizza and soda break. Because Rivera was 17 at the time of the crime, his maximum possible sentence if convicted is life in prison rather than the death penalty.","Washington Redskins safety Sean Taylor was murdered in November 2007  during a burglary .

A murder trial turned into a farce when an interpreter confessed half-an-hour into vital evidence that he was a fake, filling in for his busy wife. The judge halted the trial of Rajvinder Kaur, who killed her mother-in-law with a rolling pin, when the court realised interpreter Mubarak Lone was leaving out key words and phrases in his translating. Mr Lone was interpreting for Kaur’s husband, Iqbal Singh, who spoke Punjabi, but struggled to even get the oath right for the Sikh witness at Winchester Crown Court in Hampshire. The judge temporarily suspended the murder trial of Rajvinder Kaur, pictured, who was sentenced for battering her mother-in-law to death with a rolling pin . He was finally caught out by junior counsel Sukhdev Garcha, who also spoke the language, half-an-hour into the the faltering evidence. In the absence of the jury, Mr Lone was forced to confess to Mr Justice Barnett that he was not a qualified translator and was awaiting the results of his interpreter test. He later revealed that his wife - the booked interpreter - was busy and he had come to do her job instead. t comes after a series of problems . with translators supplied by Applied Language Solutions (ALS),  who were . recently  given a Government contract to supply translators to courts. Judges and court officials across the . country have criticised the Ministry of Justice's deal with ALS after . stories of translators failing to arrive for trials or unable to . accurately interpret proceedings for defendants, witnesses and victims. Kaur, . 37, was yesterday sentenced to life imprisonment and told she would . serve a minimum term of 11 years for battering her mother-in-law Baljit . Kaur Buttar to death with a rolling pin at her home in Southampton last . February. Defence barrister Jonathan Fuller QC said Mr Lone wrongly translated words, such as saying 'bitter; instead of 'irritable' and 'Allah' instead of 'One God'. But the farce continued. A second translator drafted in to cover the case, was 'completely out of her depth' and in the end the case was only able to continue with the assistance of Mr Garcha. Unqualified interpreter Mubarak Lone said he was covering for his busy wife at Winchester Crown Court, pictured . In total it wasted a day of work at the court, at a cost of tens of thousands of pounds. Mr Garcha said: 'I couldn’t believe . the first interpreter was so woefully inadequate and then it happened . again with the second who was completely out of her depth. 'She didn’t understand a lot of words and phrases and her vocabulary was completely lacking. 'If I hadn’t spoken up then people in the court would have thought everything was being interpreted correctly. 'It would have been to the detriment of our client - we could have had a miscarriage of justice. 'That’s the price you pay.' Defence barrister Jonathan Fuller QC added: 'It’s at the very heart of the justice system because the words are the evidence. 'If you find, as a defence counsel, . that you are calling evidence on words that are unreliable then that is . the start of a miscarriage of justice.' Mr Justice Barnett told the court: ‘This is extremely unfortunate, to use a classic understatement.’ In a brief statement, ALS said it would not comment on individual cases.‘Any complaints received about interpreters are investigated thoroughly and, where necessary, the interpreter is suspended from working with ALS until the investigation is complete. 'At that point ALS will either remove them from its register, reinstate them or provide further training, as appropriate,’ it said. ALS has claimed its contract, which started formally on February 1, would save the Government £60 million over five years. But many interpreters said they had boycotted the firm in reaction to low rates of pay, claiming that led to a struggle by ALS to recruit translators, and prompting the use of untrained people in courts. The company is being monitored daily after failing to meet targets. It was eight per cent off target from January to April this year, prompting action from the Ministry of Justice.","Fake translator stopped half-an-hour into key evidence .

Phil, who was just a few feet away from the action, said he often came face to face with hungry alligators on the hunt for food but was shocked to see this one polish off the rubbery flip flip in a matter of seconds. He said: ‘I was watching this alligator as it slowly floated around in the marsh pond. ‘I could immediately tell something along the edge of the pond caught his attention as he started going into a stealthy stalking mode. Fishing: Maybe the alligator was looking for some sole . Surprised: The photographer was convinced the alligator would spit the shoe out . Flip flops might be too much even for an alligators sturdy stomach . ‘I figured he had spotted a crab or big fish and was headed over to see if he could snag it. ‘There was some sort of pink coloured debris there in the reeds that I had previously noticed but I didn't think the gator was interested in that. ‘Well it turns out that was precisely what caught the alligator's attention and once he grabbed it and lifted it up, I recognized it as a pink rubber flip flop sandal. ‘At this point I assumed he would bite down on the shoe, realize it was inedible, and spit it back out. Down the hatch: In the end the animal swallowed the flip flop - but later had a confused look on its face, according to the photographer who took these shots of it . ‘But to my surprise he proceeded to carry the flip flop out from the reeds and back into the pond. ‘I was still waiting for him to discard the rubber shoe but to my horror the alligator chewed down on the pink sandal a few more times before finally gulping it down whole. ‘I know that alligators will pick up and sometimes eat all sorts of things but I'm not sure if it can successfully break down and pass a rubber shoe, or if it will clog up the alligator's digestive system. ‘After swallowing the flip flop the alligator floated over near to my location and had a bit of a confused look on his face as if he was trying to decide if perhaps eating that shoe may not have been a wise decision. ‘I've been keeping my eye out for him ever since and will continue to do so.’","The shoe-loving animal was spotted at Huntington Beach State Park in South Carolina .

The user wears the needles in the ear and, if they feel the urge to smoke, they simply press or twist the needles. Practitioners also report excellent results with weight loss and weight management, where the needles are used to help dieters curb cravings and halt binge cycles. Pinpoint accuracy: The map, devised by Dr Nogier 50 years ago, combines . Eastern and Western medicine to devise a treatment using needles to . stimulate reflexology points . The treatment, which was brought to . light int he West 50 years ago by a French doctor, Dr Paul Nogier, has . been used in Chinese and Egyptian medicine for millenia. When Dr Nogier was presented with a . patient with strange cauterisations in his ears, he questioned the man . who told him he had self-treated his sciatica using an adapted version . of Egyptian learnings. Dr Nogier developed the treatment . further, devising a map of the ear - which he found resembled the shape . of an upside-down foetus - that featured points, each of which . corresponded to a different part of the body. Happy couple: Penelope married actor Javier Bardem in 2010 and the two have one son, Leo Encina . Quite why Penelope Cruz is wearing the needles is as yet unknown. The star is a smoker, but has not stated publicly that she is attempting to quit. She married Javier Bardem in 2010 after dating for three years, and the pair, who are notoriously private, had their first child, Leo Encinas Cruz, in 2011. Using Dr Nogier's map, it appears as though Penelope's needles could be placed in the zones which would correspond to muscle relaxation, the lumbar and thoracic spine, the knee and the occiput, which is the back region of the head - pointing at potential treatment for back pain. The needles, which are very fine and can not be felt day-to-day while they are being worn, do not hurt once they are in the ear. The patient may feel a very slight pricking sensation when the practitioner inserts the needle, and some report a certain level of discomfort when manipulating the needles. Otherwise, it is entirely pain-free. The treatment was officially recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 1987. Auriculotherapy is a long name for a treatment that is actually very simple - some refer to it simply as Ear Acupuncture. Based around the same philosophy as traditional reflexology and acupuncture, practitioners use needles in points in the ear that correspond to different areas of the body to treat a wide variety of conditions. The therapy has been used in Egyptian and Chinese medicine for millenia but was adapted 50 years ago for a Western audience by a French doctor, Dr Paul Nogier. He devised a map of the ear, marking the exact points on the ear and labelling where they corresponded to elsewhere on the body. By inserting needles into the relevant areas, practitioners can treat conditions as wide-ranging as smoking addiction, weight issues, sciatica, depression, tinnitus, back pain and infertility.","Star is undergoing auriculotherapy - a form of acupuncture developed in France .

F1 heiress Petra Ecclestone is reeling after £500,000 worth of jewellery was apparently stolen from her £32million mansion - after it was viewed by a fake 'Kazakh millionaire', MailOnline can reveal today. The 24-year-old blonde, who is the daughter of Formula 1 billionaire Bernie Ecclestone, has put her home in London's Belgravia on the market - but was stunned to discover the disappearance of diamond earrings and a diamond Rolex watch following a viewing. Petra, a married mother-of-one, has been staying in London for the summer with her baby daughter Lavinia and her husband James Stunt. Her main home is in Los Angeles, where she lives in a £55million ($85million) estate previously owned by Candy Spelling, and a friend told MailOnline: 'Petra was out with her sister Tamara a few weeks ago when the viewing took place. As soon as this man left, it was discovered that the jewellery, which was on a bedroom nightstand, was missing.' Furious: Petra Ecclestone has been left reeling after £500,000worth of jewellery was stolen during a viewing of her $32million London home. She joined her sister Tamara for a shopping trip at Harrods on Thursday . Do you have £32 million? Petra Ecclestone's Belgravia mansion is up for sale . Both Ecclestone sisters have their homes up for sale. Tamara, 29, has also listed her house in Chelsea, West London, for £19.75 million after moving into a new home with her husband Jay Rutland that she bought for £45million in Kensington Palace Gardens in 2011, and the property has not been lived in for some time. Estate agents have reported in the past few months that a man calling himself Oleg who wears sunglasses - has viewed several other multi-million dollar properties in the area. It is now understood Oleg is not his real name. Police were NOT called as Petra was worried about a media leak- and she is not claiming for the theft on insurance. Meanwhile, all household staff were immediately checked by security, but found to be clean.

In an interview in Grazia magazine in January 2011, where she posed sprawling in her London home, Petra showed off a picture of Raquel Welch on a cross taken by Terry O'Neill and it was reported that she had a collection of Rolex watches. She was said to own seven, at an average cost of £20,000 each, at the time. The house also features artwork by Damien Hirst. Another broker who sells some of London's most expensive homes in Belgravia told MailOnline a colleague had met a man claiming to be called 'Oleg'. Sources say they believe this to be the man responsible for the theft from Petra's home. The property agent said 'Oleg' had turned up in a chauffer-driven Bentley, but he never removed his sunglasses. 'He wanted to see a very expensive house through me and the owner was in town, so they weren't doing viewings.' Discussing the Ecclestone theft, the broker added: 'Subsequently, I heard he had been shown around a house in Belgravia and swiped jewellery.

The government shut-down is having an unforeseen effect on NFL player Donte Whitner, who announced via Twitter last week that he's legally changing his surname to Hitner following what he says are unfair NFL fines for illegal hits. Whitner, a safety for the San Francisco 49ers, wants his Nike football jersey to read 'Hitner' for his next game - but he's going to wait, since the shutdown means his name-change won't be processed for at least a month. Whitner's vowed to legally change his name to Hitner after the NFL fined him $21,00 for an illegal hit on a St. Louis Rams player earlier this season. Shut down: Donte will remain a Whitner until at least November . His plans to drop the W from his last name were scuppered by NFL officials, who require a player to legally change his moniker before wearing a jersey emblazoned with it. The name-change could prove costly, too: according to TMZ, Nike requires a player to buy up any remaining inventory featuring the old name. That means Whiter, as Hitner, would have to buy all the unsold jerseys with his name on them before the company would begin producing new Hitner versions. But according to the Bleacher Report, the cost might not deter Whitner - he's due to earn $3.8 million this year. Protest: 49ers player Whitner (31) is changing his name for what he says was an unfair $21,000 fine for an illegal tackle . The would-be Hitner took to Twitter yesterday to vent his frustration: 'Damn gov't shutdown lol GM,' he wrote. By the estimation of Deadspin, the soonest Whitner could be on-field in a Hitner jersey is the November 17 game against the Saints. But it could be a lot longer: Chad Johnson had to wait a year to put 'Ochocinco' on the back of his jersey, due to contractual obligations with Reebok. Jersey sure: Whitner (left) is determined that his Nike football jersey will read Hitner instead of Whitner . The Ohio native seems to be taking the setback in-stride, and maintains the name-change will go ahead: . 'If you ask the fans around San Francisco, the Bay Area, or anyone . that's a fan of me, they call me Donte Hitner any way,' he told 49ers.com. 'Everything we do is for the fans right? It's all entertainment. We all . understand that. It's entertainment, but that's what I do, it's my game.

'Jessica', a girl of 14, claims that she was sexually abused by a violent criminal but the authorities did not intervene (posed by model) The girl, known only as 'Jessica' claims she was abused daily by a 24-year-old man after social services failed to accept that she was a victim grooming. On one ocassion married father-of-two Arshid Hussain was even caught with the half naked schoolgirl under his bed but shocking documents released today reveal that police arrested her and let him go. Now 'Jessica' is one four women suing Rotherham council over 'systematic failures' to protect them from 'sexual abuse by predatory men when they were children' according to their lawyers. South Yorkshire solicitors Switalskis . said they are working on behalf of the women who want to take legal . action against the council because of the abuse they suffered. Today in a stunning development Rotherham Council confirmed that Deputy Leader of council and vice chair of the police and crime panel Councillor Jahngier Akhtar has stepped down over allegations that he knew about the relationship. The Times alleges that at the time Mr Akhtar, who is related to Hussain, not only knew about his relationship with a child but also that he set up a 'deal under which a . violent offender (Hussain) agreed to hand a missing child to police . after being assured that he would not be detained'. But Mr Akhtar, who was a taxi driver at . the time, told MailOnline shortly before he stepped down today that the allegations are 'total lies' and also denied that there had been any such deal. A spokesman confirmed that the council had referred the matter to the police' to consider if any criminal offence has been committed and to undertake any appropriate criminal investigation.' Rotherham, South Yorkshire, has become known as Britain's under-age sex capital, after a string of high profile cased where authorities have let down vulnerable children. 'Jessica' got pregnant twice by Hussain, who at the time had convictions for robbery and affray, and was about to be jailed for violent disorder. But social services claimed they had 'no power' to stop him having sex with her despite the fact that she was only 14. The . Times revealed today that Hussain has never been prosecuted for . suspected child sex offences, and is only now being investigated 14 years on. At the time he was on a social services . list of men believed to be grooming up to 40 young girls in the area and more than a . dozen believed he was their 'boyfriend'. It has been alleged that Rotherham Borough Council (pictured) said they had 'no power' to intervene despite an admission the man and girl were having sex . Jessica described how she met Hussain days after her 14th birthday in 1999, and after he bought her chicken and chips he took her to some woods and told her: 'You're not really 16 are you? You look too young'. They starting seeing each other regularly and her parents could not keep them apart - in the end she was taken into 'emergency' care. But Jessica was rarely in school so the relationship continued, and Hussain would even follow her on holiday, on one occasion renting a caravan in Skegness so they could have sex there. In June 2000 police and social services reports said that Hussain and the girl, now 15, were 'known to be having a sexual relationship' and she was 'at risk of sexual abuse'. But after he was sent to prison for violent disorder and intimidation in a different case, Jessica got an injunction against him. Describing the infatuation Jessica said: 'It was like somebody put a spell on me. I wanted to marry him. He didn't tell me he was already married. 'I didn't think of myself as being groomed, but now I realise it was an abusive relationship. It can stay with you for the rest of your life. 'Police and social services don't want to take any responsibility for what happened back then'. Speaking about when she was caught in bed with him by police, Jessica, which is not her real name, told The Times: 'I was in bed upstairs with Ash when the police came into the house. He panicked and pulled on some trousers. 'I grabbed a pair of knickers and tried to hide under the bed. One of the police officers told me to come out. He could see my legs sticking out.'; . Officers then found an offensive weapon and she was arrested, but despite noting later she was 'at risk of sexual abuse' Hussain was released. A Home Office funded review, examining . her case, quoted by The Times confirmed that Hussain, with permission . of the authorities, was allowed to call her mobile phone and even to collect her from her foster carer's home. Resigned: Jahangir Akhtar, deputy leader of Rotherham council, denies that he knew anything about his relative's sexual relationship with a 14-year-old but has stepped down today . It . said: 'Perpetrator was allowed to contact (Jessica) via mobile . telephone, was allowed to arrange to collect her from foster carer's . home by ringing in advance and asking to meet him at the end of street' with the 'knowledge and consent' of social services. It also said there was an 'unwillingness . to recognise danger of relationship' an 'in the absence of any criminal . prosecution of perpetrator as a pimp, all rumours about him were . speculation and there was no cause for concern.' Staff 'also took some comfort in knowing where (Jessica) was', it said, and Hussain was even allowed to attend appointments with her GP. Solicitor Riyaz Shaikh told MailOnline this afternoon that his client Hussain is unwell and unable to comment today. A spokesman for Rotherham Borough Council said following Operation Yewtree, the authority asked South Yorkshire Police (SYP) to thoroughly review all historical cases that may be linked to child sexual exploitation. He added: 'That review is ongoing and continues with a number of live and ongoing investigations. 'The Council wishes to support SYP and not potentially compromise this process. As such we will not be making further comments on the article without further consultation with our police colleagues.' In response to the claims, South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright said he was deeply concerned. Mr . Wright said: 'The allegations made in today's Times newspaper about the . way in which various agencies failed to adequately combat child sexual . exploitation and protect vulnerable victims 14 years ago concerns me . deeply. 'The approach . taken today is vastly improved, and as commissioner, my determination is . to ensure that the approach that is now being taken by those agencies . in responding to and investigating allegations of such crimes is . consummately professional. 'I . will be seeking assurances from the chief constable and other agencies . that all allegations of such crimes are thoroughly investigated, that . victims are fully supported and that this process is underpinned by the . most robust and thorough processes and policies.' The commissioner said extra resources . had been provided to South Yorkshire Police to help combat child sexual . exploitation and he noted that Her Majesty's Inspectorate of . Constabulary is about to review the approach to the problem being taken . by all police forces. The authorities in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, have been accused of turning a blind eye to sex grooming gangs for more than a decade, confidential files have revealed . In 2010 five men, described by a . judge as 'sexual predators', were given lengthy jail terms after they . were found guilty of grooming teenage girls for sex. The . prosecution was the first of a series of high-profile cases in the last . three years that have revealed the exploitation of young girls in towns . including Rochdale, Derby and Oxford. Last year it emerged police in the town turned a blind eye to allegations of sexual abuse of white girls by gangs of largely Pakistani men for more than a decade. Research, reports and case files also revealed that council officials were desperate to cover up any racial link to the abuse of young girls. Following the 2010 case, The Times . claimed details from 200 restricted-access documents showed how police . and child protection agencies in the South Yorkshire town had extensive . knowledge of these activities for a decade, yet a string of offences . went unprosecuted. The allegations led to a range of official investigations, including a probe by the Home Affairs Select Committee. South . Yorkshire Police said today it 'deeply regrets' the publication of The . Times story 'about an on-going, complex and highly sensitive . investigation into matters of historic child sexual exploitation.' But . The Times defended its decision to publish saying it believed stories . like this 'will encourage others to come forward to tell police what . happened to them so that successful prosecutions of their abusers will . be more rather than less likely.' It said: 'The police have asked us not to publish (the story) at this time for fear of prejudicing their own inquiries. 'While . we recognise the significant advances that have recently been made in . the force's approach to tackling child sexual exploitation, we do not . believe that enough has yet been done. 'South Yorkshire Police has had more than a dozen years to investigate the crimes against (the girl). 'It . is almost a year since this newspaper first highlighted the abuse . inflicted upon other vulnerable girls in Rotherham by groups of . offenders who were allowed to act with virtual impunity."" David Greenwood, of Switalskis, said: ""It is important to remember that at the time of the abuse they were children under the age of 16 and could not legally consent."" Referring to the Home Affairs Select Committee report, Mr Greenwood said: 'The report noted part of the problem is that adults may misunderstand the grooming process and assume that the young person was a willing participant in a relationship, rather than the victim of sexual abuse.'","Married father-of-two Arshid Hussain allegedly groomed dozens of girls with the full knowledge of the authorities .

'I broke protocol and stuck my hand in a cat cage instead of using the stick provided. The cat let go and pushed my arm back through the cage. This tiger was not aggressive towards me. I hope for a healthy recovery so I can return to work everyday with my tigers,' she said in a statement. Scroll down for video... Recovering: This is Kelci Saffrey, the 27-year-old zookeeper whose arm was torn off by a tiger. She has vowed to return to the park . Attack: An employee at the G.W. Exotic Animal Park in Wynnewood, Oklahoma, was injured when she was attacked by a tiger at the park Saturday morning . Closed for a time: The zoo was expecting lots of visitors this weekend because of the cooler temperatures . According to KFOR, Saffery underwent surgery on her arm Monday morning and has lost only the tip of her ring finger. Doctors say she will remain in hospital for about two weeks. Her statement read: . 'I . Kelci Saffery release this statement to the press on October 5th. I . broke protocol and stuck my hand in a cat cage instead of using the . stick provided.

'Her fault': The park's owner, Joe Schreibvogel, said the employee violated safety protocol by placing her arm inside the tiger cage. She almost lost her arm in the incident on Saturday . Joe 'Exotic' Schreibvogel, said there was 'no other way of avoiding' incidents like today's other than 'handcuffing' his employees' hands behind their backs . Schreivogel said Saffery was an exemplary employee. 'She . was probably one of the best people I’ve ever worked with. Most . dedicated. You had to force her to take a day off,' Schreibvogel told . KFOR. The tiger attack occurred at the GW Exotic Animal Park in Wynnewood at around 10am on Saturday. Joe Schreibvogel, told MailOnline hat the employee 'violated safety protocol' by placing her arm inside the tiger cage. He said there was 'no other way of avoiding this other than handcuffing my employees' hands behind their backs'. 'All I can do is train them and work with them as an employer. I can’t babysit them,' he said. 'I can't babysit them', says Schreibvogel about his employees . The eccentric Schreibvogel, who sometimes wears sparkly clothing as he poses with his wild beasts, told the Mail Online that the animal would not be put down because 'it was not the tiger's fault'. According to Schreibvogel, the employee had 'three comments' before she was air-lifted to OU Medical Center. 'She . said it was her fault, that she wanted to come back to work and asked . us not to release her name until she had spoken to her family,' he said. The park was closed after the incident but reopened only a few hours later. An update on the park's Facebook page said the woman was out of surgery and that her arm had been saved. ‘She . has a long road of repairs ahead of her but this is a miracle and . thanks for the prayers everyone,’ said the post on Saturday evening. The park's owner said the animal would not be put down because 'it was not the tiger's fault' Schreibvogel said he did not know why the employee put her hand into the cage with the tiger . This is not the first time the GW Exotic Animal Park has been at the centre of controversy, and the 54-acre park, which is located outside Oklahoma City, has had previous run-ins with regulators. GW . Exotic is licensed by the federal government because it's open to the . public - charging admission to come very close to what Schreibvogel . calls the largest 'refuge' for 'unwanted' animals in the world. The . park is home to nearly 170 big cats: lions, tigers, leopards, and about . 800 other animals, including camels, monkeys and exotic birds. He . also runs a controversial breeding programme, selling tiger cubs - only . to zoos, he says - for up to $5,000 each and, at the same time, . cross-breeding exotics like ‘ligers’, a cross between a lion and tiger, . and even what he calls a tuliger, a mix of a liger and a tiger, . according to CBS News. However, Schreibvogel admits he does not have a background in zoology or veterinary medicine. ‘I grew up a farm kid, and that's pretty much my background,’ he told CBS. Over . the years, GW Exotic has come under scrutiny by the U.S. Department of . Agriculture (USDA) for concerns ranging from 'public contact with . dangerous animals' to a 'lack of physical barriers'. The park is home to nearly 170 big cats: lions, tigers, leopards, and about 800 other animals, including camels, monkeys and exotic birds . Records show that, in 2006, it had its license suspended for two weeks and paid $25,000 for 'facilities violations'. It is currently under investigation by the USDA for the death of 23 tiger cubs between 2009-2010, according to CBS News. The Humane Society of the United States sent an activist undercover into GW Exotics in 2011, posing as an employee. The . video, which the Humane Society calls ‘alarming’, shows Schreibvogel . smacking a cub to make it walk and other tigers being hit and dragged . across gravel. In another incident on tape, a boy was suddenly attacked while interacting with a young tiger, and began screaming. They . say at least five tigers died at the facility during the investigation – . two of them had been sick for months and ‘may have been shot by GW . employees’, according to their website. The . society also says a number of visitors at the park have suffered bites . from tigers, including one child whose bite became infected. 'Dangerous': Critics of the park, such as the Humane Society of the United States, says several people have been bitten by tigers at the park. But Schreibvogel says it is not true . However, Schreibvogel says that they have 'never had an accident here at this facility'. 'I . most confident that our visitors here at the park are safe. We have . spent milions on building our cages to where our park is safe. No one . is allowed to go into a cage with an animal,' he told the Mail Online on Saturday evening. According to Schreibvogel, today's incident should 'not reflect on exotic animals or on any zoo being safe or not'. 'We don’t know why she stuck her arm into the tiger.' Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the Humane Society, says GW Exotic is ‘a ticking time bomb’. According . to CBS News, Schreibvogel responded to the comment saying, ‘It is a . ticking time bomb - if somebody thinks they're going to walk in here and . take my animals away, it's going to be a small Waco.’ He . said: ‘I have poured my entire life into what I do, to care for . animals. Nobody is going to walk in here and freely shut me down and . take my rights away from me as long as I am not breaking the law.’ The owner says he has 'poured his life' into the park 'to care for animals' A .

Humane Society is currently urging the US Department of Agriculture to . adopt regulations banning public contact with dangerous wild animals no . matter the age of the animals. Current . regulations generally allow public contact with tiger cubs between the . ages of 8 and 12 weeks, and encourage the reckless over breeding of . tiger cubs and surplus of captive adult tigers. Baby cubs: Current regulations allow public contact only with tiger cubs up to the age of 12 weeks . The . HSUS is also urging Congress to pass H.R. 4122, the Big Cats and Public . Safety Protection Act to prohibit the private ownership and breeding of . tigers and other dangerous big cats. However, Schreibvogel says a ban would not stop accidents happening. 'You . can ban public contact with animals till the cows come home, but that . doesn’t mean it stops employees from breaking protocol,' he told the . Mail Online. According to Schreibvogel, the accident was 'not the zoo’s fault'. 'An . employee made a mistake and we’re paying for it. She was an excellent . employee, and she is more than welcome to have her job back.' He said it was 'next to impossible' to hire more staff members because it was 'hard work' being employed at the park. 'You come to work here to clean cages and scoop poop. This is not about cuddling with full grown tigers, and a lot of people think that it is.' 'We have a high turn over because this is very hard work,' he told the Mail Online. Schreibvogel . said he is planning to release a six-song country-western music album, . titled Joe Exotic – The Tiger King, with music videos, on November 15 to . ‘help fund tigers in the wild’.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are set to copy millions of other British families by building a conservatory on their new 10-bedroom country bolthole in the grounds of Sandringham. William, Kate and Prince George are likely to move into Anmer Hall in a matter of months and are spending large sums to make the Norfolk mansion more private, secure and comfortable. Royal aides have now applied for planning consent to put a glass-roofed extension on the kitchen at the Georgian property, which has been given to the couple by the Queen. New life: A conservatory is to be built on Anmer Hall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's future home in the grounds of Sandringham . Second home: If as expected the Cambridges move in, the new conservatory could be built in the place of the current one, which overlooks the grand gardens . Their proposed conservatory is an adaptation of a planned 16ft by 16ft garden room which has already been approved by King's Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council. But the application is not being published 'for reasons of national security'. The original plans for the garden room showed it having panoramic views from its windows on all three sides with a tiled roof. But a new planning application for the Georgian mansion on the Sandringham estate asks for a glazed roof on the extension instead of tiles, allowing even more sunlight to flood in. An architect's drawing submitted with the application, shows a 10ft by 6ft table as the room's centre piece where William and Kate and baby Prince George will eat and entertain guests. The Queen has asked the current tenant to vacate the property as soon as possible, four years before his lease is up, and he may be gone by the end of the year. The conservatory will overlook a patio with a new pergola made from stone columns with oak beams for plants to trail through and provide shade. Grand: The 10-bedroom Georgian mansion already has a tenant, but the Queen has asked him to leave four years before his lease is up . The Grade Two listed hall already has a conservatory, but it is unclear if it will be kept or knocked down to make way for the new one. The new plans have been drawn up by architect Charles Morris, who was behind a controversial extension for Prince Charles at his own country home Highgrove House. The amended application, submitted by the Sandringham estate, includes plans to install a generator to ensure that security equipment still functions in the event of a power cut. It also asks the council to do away with an earlier requirement for an archaeological dig to take place on the route of a proposed new driveway to the ten bedroom house. The dig was originally proposed as the field which the driveway will cross was once the site of the village of Anmer which dates back to Anglo Saxon times. Last week it was revealed that the path of the new driveway had been carved out by diggers and archaeologists had begun a preliminary investigation to see what was under the surface. New home: Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, pictured with their son Prince George, are expected to move into Anmer Hall in the next few months . Plans: A church situated near Anmer Hall on the Sandringham Estate is having to change its entrance to allow the couple their own private entrance . Royal aides state in the application that the foundations of the road will not be deep enough to disturb any ancient remains. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's plans for a conservatory on their new home is based on a trend started more than two centuries ago. Britain's love of them dates back to the early 19th century, when they were a signature of the grandest properties. The glass structures allowed people to enjoy their gardens all year round, and they were often doubled as greenhouses to grow fruit and vegetables. They became more mainstream thanks to the Crystal Palace, which housed the 1851 . Exhibition in London, and a glass extension soon became a must for the rich and famous. There was a further boom in the 1920s but it was not until the 1970s that they became affordable for many and became the emblem of the upwardly mobile, now often called Worcester Woman and Mondeo Man. Today homeowners can construct their own ones using DIY kits costing just £995, but the most expensive can cost more than £60,000. They propose that archaeologists will monitor building work and that a full dig will only be carried out if any important relics are unearthed. Council officials are due to decide in days whether the amendment will be allowed, possibly using delegated powers so the plans do not have to go before councillors. The change will speed up work on the new driveway, although alterations to the hall are unlikely to be completed for some months. The start of work has raised speculation that William, 31, and wife Kate are set to move in within a matter of months. Work has also started on creating a new car park and path for St Mary's church next door to the hall as the existing church gate will become a private entrance for the Duke and Duchess. Anmer Hall is set to become the couple's second luxury home following the prince's decision to leave the RAF last month after three years as a search and rescue helicopter pilot in Anglesey. He and Kate are in the process of moving into their new London home - the 21-room Apartment 1A at Kensington Palace - which has been renovated at a cost to taxpayers of £1.1million. But all the work to Anmer Hall will be paid for by the Royal family as it is privately owned by the Queen. The hall which includes a tennis court and swimming pool is around two miles from Sandringham House. It is surrounded by farmland on the Queen's 20,000 acre estate, meaning that Kate and William will have a high level of privacy to bring up baby George. The Queen is believed to have asked the current tenant to leave even though he has four years left on his lease. Businessman James Everett has rented the hall from the Queen for the last 13 years and has been running his bespoke timber company, Norfolk Oak, from its stables. His company's blog confirmed in July that the hall would soon be 'faced with Royalty once more'. Norfolk Oak has already moved its workshops and offices to new premises at the former RAF West Raynham base in Norfolk. Mr Everett and his family are understood to be moving soon, but he has not responding to requests for comment. King's Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council gave planning permission in March for improvements to Anmer Hall including the garden room. Home sweet home: Kensington Palace, where the royal couple have given their apartment a £1million makeover, pictured shrouded in scaffolding and coverings . Consent was also given for a garage block and wood store to be converted into storage areas and accommodation which could be used by police guards or baby George's nanny . The re-routing of the driveway will mean that the front gate to the house will be moved so members of the public will be kept away. It is understood that dozens of extra armed officers are being recruited to help provide security at Anmer Hall. Norfolk Police confirmed in July that the force was looking for extra firearms officer to 'address a current shortfall in numbers'. The hall was used as an illicit bolt-hole by Prince Charles and the then Camilla Parker-Bowles during their long-running affair when it was rented by the prince's late friend Hugh van Cutsem. Prince William, who is close to the van Cutsems' four sons is also said to have enjoyed many happy visits to the hall as a child. A Clarence House spokeswoman refused to discuss the plans for Anmer Hall, saying: 'It is a private matter. We won't be making any comment on it at all.' The house was previously leased to the Duke and Duchess of Kent as their country house from 1972 until 1990.","New garden room on kitchen part of changes at Anmer Hall in Norfolk .

Patients will have to sacrifice accident and emergency wards if they want seven-day medical care, NHS bosses have declared. After finally accepting proposals for supermarket-style opening hours in general practices, health leaders have sparked fresh conflict by claiming it will mean a trade-off with fully-functioning hospitals. Critics have blasted the announcement as a contradiction that could serve to make the state of health care even worse. Compromise: After finally accepting seven-day care, NHS leaders have challenged patients to sacrifice A&E . The warning, laid out in a proposal released yesterday, criticised supporters of round-the-clock surgeries for naively expecting 'all-singing, all-dancing care'. Norman Williams, author of the British Medical Association report, told The Times: 'There is no question: for a smaller hospital at the moment, it will be very difficult to deliver that all-singing, all-dancing seven-day care. 'That's why you have to take into consideration a degree of centralisation. We're probably not being bold enough.' Rural towns would be wise to forego 'super deluxe' 24-hour care in favour of necessary emergency services, Mr Williams advised. Jonathan Isaby, Political Director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, blasted the 'mind-boggling' warning that forces taxpayers to plan illnesses around office hours. Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Isaby said: 'It is mind-boggling that the BMA should suggest that a seven-day GP service cannot be provided as well as fully-functioning hospitals. 'Taxpayers who are forking out considerable amounts in tax to fund the NHS cannot plan illnesses around office hours on weekdays and should expect a decent service seven days a week, not merely when it is most convenient for doctors. U-turn: Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS's medical director, has accepted research showing death rates peak at weekends when senior doctors are off-duty. He encouraged hospitals to implement Tesco-style opening hours . 'There is no reason why the service cannot be improved to serve patients better, particularly if considerable amounts of waste across the health service are exposed and cut.' Calls for more flexible quality medical treatment stretch back years, as research shows death rates spike at weekends, when senior doctors are off-duty. Having repeatedly lambasted the campaign as 'utter folly', Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS's medical director, shocked many by proclaiming it is no longer acceptable for surgeries to be tailored to staff convenience, leaving patients to suffer. In a newly published position paper on seven-day services, the BMA acknowledges that studies show death rates are higher among patients admitted to hospital at the weekend. It also notes that an inquiry into the Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust, where up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died unnecessarily in one of the worst hospital scandals in living memory, found that patients felt vulnerable at the weekend. The statement says: ‘Improving care quality for patients means more staff, especially senior doctors, on site at weekend and evenings.’ BMA chairman Dr Mark Porter denied the organisation had made a ‘Damascene conversion’ and added: ‘Patients should have greater access to high-quality care throughout the week and doctors should be part of the solution.’ But the proposed compromise has sparked yet another round of conflict, with critics warning specialist units would have to be cut so that seven-day centres can afford necessary services such as blood tests, scans, investigations and surgery.","British Medical Association finally agreed to back round-the-clock care .

The billionaire owner of the Grangemouth fuel refinery was spotted relaxing on his luxury yacht just hours after winning beating union bosses at the imperiled complex into submission. Jim Ratcliffe's company Ineos forced through a survival plan for the huge petrochemical complex in Falkirk, Scotland, which saw workers swallow a pay freeze, redundancies and changes to their pensions. And almost as soon as the ink dried on the humiliating deal, which also bans strike action at the plant for three years, Mr Ratcliffe jetted off to his luxurious ship, moored on the Cote d'Azur in the south of France. Luxury: Mr Ratcliffe's £130million Hampshire II was seen in the waters of the Mediterranean in the south of France . Extravagant: The handsome vessel has an upper deck bar and a below-deck wine cellar with a underwater viewing area . He entertained 23 guests on the 255ft Hampshire II superyacht, attended by his personal staff. The extravagant vessel, valued at £130million a year, also costs the billionaire tens of millions a year in maintenance costs. Billionaire: Mr Ratcliffe headed to the south of France after a tense week for his Grangemouth refinery . Guests on the boat could enjoy a bar on the upper deck, or visit a wine cellar below, which has a underwater viewing area. Mr Ratcliffe's floating palace also mingles sophistication with fun, as the 82ft-tall crow's nest features a zip-wire to carry guests back to the deck. A full-sized tennis court on the deck can be converted into a helipad. The vessel, built by Feadship completed its sea trials in 2012. It replaces the older Hampshire I. His luxury retreat came after a tense week in Grangemouth, which saw Ineos almost close the plant after failing to reach a compromise with union leaders. Bosses at the company had announced they would close the Grangemouth petrochemical plant after a majority of workers refused a last-ditch plan to make sure the ageing plant remained commercially viable. Closure of the plant - said to be costing Ineos £10million a week to run - would have resulted in hundreds of job losses. It was also feared that the oil refinery in the complex could quickly follow, costing still more jobs. The Grangemouth complex alone is responsible for ten per cent of the entire Scottish economy. But Mr Ratcliffe seemed not to be . phased by how close the complex - Scotland's only remaining oil refinery . - came to oblivion as the keen sailor headed to his home on the waves. After . union leaders backed down in the dispute, and took on the survival plan . in its entirety, he hailed 'a victory for common sense'. The . industrialist, who gained the nickname Dr No for his refusal to . compromise with his workers, has said publicly that he is unabashed . about his extreme wealth. The . reclusive businessman made his money by buying up unwanted assets from . large industrial companies - BP in the case of Grangemouth - and . ruthlessly cutting costs to maximise profits. Just nine years after its foundation, . Ineos is the third-largest chemicals company in the world, and Mr . Ratcliffe features prominently on lists of Britain's richest people. Pricey: The Hampshire II is Mr Ratcliffe's second yacht, and costs millions a year just to maintain . Take it easy: The ship was sighted near Port de la Madrague on the Cote d'Azur . Assets: Mr Ratcliffe owners two thirds of Ineos, which in turn owns the Grangemouth plant and refinery . He owns two-thirds of the company, giving him a fortune estimated in the billions. He is also said to have a passion for sit-on lawnmowers and own a substantial collection. The grammar-school educated businessman used to live in Hampshire, where locals said he would often come and go by helicopter, but moved to Switzerland in 2010 for tax purposes. He is separated from his wife Amanda, . whom he married in 1985. She now lives in a farmhouse near Salisbury, . Wiltshire, where she owns a horse riding company. They have two sons, Samuel, 21 and . George, 19. Mr Ratcliffe graduated with a degree in chemical engineering . from Birmingham University and spent 15 years as a humble chemical . engineer. But he then developed a taste for . business, acquiring an MBA from the London Business School. In 1989, he . was appointed a director of Advent International, an American private . equity group, and became steeped in the world of finance. Industry: The Grangemouth petrochemical plant in Falkirk, Scotland, has been saved from immediate closure . Survival plan: Grangemouth workers found out last week that their jobs would be saved after union leaders caved in to Ineos's demands . In a recent interview with the Daily Telegraph, he said that he felt he had 'done his bit' for Britain after investing in its industry, even though other countries are much more attractive prospects. He also defended the fruits of his wealth, and played down the significance of his £130million 'nice boat'. He told the newspaper: 'Yes, I’ve made some money. But I started off in a very poor part of Manchester. 'I don’t feel hair-shirted about the fact that I have a nice boat. It’s not relevant.'","Jim Ratcliffe, chief executive of Ineos, jetted to the Cote d'Azur after pitched industrial battle .

A high school student who dressed as a homeless man for a drama assignment was so convincing that he fooled school officials — and ended up getting suspended. It began with an assignment last month, senior Michael Bodomov, 17, said: Create a character and be that person for an entire day at Mount Lebanon High School, just outside Pittsburgh. Bodomov hopes to attend the University of Pittsburgh next year and is still exploring whether theater and drama are his calling. Judging by his performance, he could be short-listed. Good actor: Michael Bodomov, 17, (not pictured) dressed up as a homeless man and went to his school in character. The teachers called the police because he was so believable . Bodomov said he created a homeless man named John who had a falling-out with his family after he ran over his younger sister. John was also swayed by a guru to give up all his material possessions. ‘I wore like a couple layers of coats and some sweatpants,’ Bodomov said. He added a pair of fingerless gloves, mismatched shoes and plastic bags for socks. He also smeared ink on his face to make it look dirty. Bodomov usually walks to school, but his mother, Marina, thought he looked so much like a homeless person that she drove him and dropped him off early, before the main entrance was open. Bodomov went to an alternate entrance, shook the door and attracted the attention of a teacher or hall monitor, who asked what the stranger wanted. ‘I had to kind of think on my feet,’ Bodomov said, since he didn't want to break character before the school day even began. ‘I kind of mumbled and said ""I need to talk to some people"",’ Bodomov recalled, adding that in retrospect that might have made officials think he was mentally unbalanced. The story: Bodomov (not pictured) created a homeless man named John who had a falling-out with his family after he ran over his younger sister . In character: Bodomov went to the Mount Lebanon High School and shook the front doors wearing his convincing homeless man garb . Bodomov said he was stuck between the desire to play his role and the temptation to just tell officials who he was. He decided that dropping hints about his identity was OK, because even if adults picked up on them, he could still say he didn't break character. ‘At one point, I think I said, ""I might be a student here"",’ and a school official responded, ‘No, you can't be. You look like you're 30 and you haven't showered in 10 days.’ He also tried showing them the garbage bag he was carrying, since it contained his school backpack. But his attention to character detail thwarted that, too. The bag was also filled with empty plastic bottles, and that's apparently all the officials saw. ‘It's not like this entire time I wasn't trying to let them know I was a student,’ Bodomov said. ‘It was pretty funny to me.’ Then the police showed up. After staying in character for a little longer, Bodomov explained the whole situation. The police left, and an administrator said he was suspended for insubordination and for breaking a rule that students must identify themselves to an administrator when asked. Officials at Mount Lebanon said the district can't comment on individual discipline. Bodomov understands that the school was in an unusual position, but the two-day suspension still stings. ‘I definitely think they overreacted,’ he said. But Bodomov's mother said the school was right to be careful, given safety concerns in the wake of recent violent shootings. She isn't upset that they suspended her son, adding, ‘It's a good school.’ When a mumbling stranger carrying a garbage bag shows up at a school, she said, ‘Who knows how it's going to turn out?’","Michael Bodomov, 17, went to Mount Lebanon High School, Pittsburgh, dressed up as a homeless man .

Prisoners should have access to computers and the internet to help with reintegration into society and reduce reoffending once they are released, according to research. Secure, controlled use of the web can also transform education, family contact and resettlement in jails, the joint Prison Reform Trust and Prisoners Education Trust report said. Through the Gateway: How Computers Can Transform Rehabilitation examines the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in prisons and its potential as a tool for rehabilitation. A report has called for prisoners to have secure, controlled access to computers and the internet . It is based on a survey of jails sent to all prison governors and directors in England and Wales supported by the National Offender Management Service (NOMS). Nearly three quarters (74 per cent) of the prison governors and managers who responded to the survey agreed that prisoners should have secure and controlled access to the internet, while 94 per cent agreed ICT skills were necessary for everyday living. Three quarters (67 per cent) said that prisoners should be able to set up bank accounts while in prison using ICT. The report said greater and more effective use of ICT in prisons would improve opportunities for education, training, employment, resettlement and strengthen family ties - all factors which have been shown to reduce reoffending on release. Nearly half (47 per cent) of adults are reconvicted within one year of release. For those serving sentences of less than 12 months and young people aged 18-20 this increases to 58 per cent. In 2011-12, just 27 per cent of prisoners entered employment on release from prison. The main barriers for prisons using ICT to improve rehabilitation were concerns about security, financial constraints, the lack of a co-ordinated strategy, licensing and insufficient central resources, researchers found. In the foreword to the report, Nick Hardwick, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, wrote: 'We can’t go on with prisons in a pre-internet dark age: inefficient, wasteful and leaving prisoners woefully unprepared for the real world they will face on release. 'I have not met one prison professional who does not think drastic change is needed.' He added: 'Of course, there are security issues that need to be managed but the technology itself allows every key stroke to be monitored and access can be risk-assessed. 'Perhaps there are some who will say computers and the internet are luxuries prisoners should do without. There was probably some grumbling when they first put telephones on the wings too and if we want prisons to rehabilitate those they hold, we have to give them the tools to do so.' The report said internet access could transform education, family contact and resettlement in jails . Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: 'Controlled use of ICT is a sensible way to bring prisons and prisoners into the 21st century. 'Closing the digital divide between people in prison and the community is vital for effective rehabilitation and resettlement.' Rod Clark, chief executive, Prisoners Education Trust, said: 'These days most people could not function without computers or the internet and if we can’t work, find a job or study without the use of ICT, how can we expect people in prison to do so? 'Technology can provide us with many solutions to help rehabilitate people in a safe, secure way and if we do not explore them, then we risk sending more people back into society without the skills or the motivation to live a life free from crime.'","Web can transform education, family contact and resettlement, says report .

As England’s football squad celebrates gaining a place in next year’s FIFA World Cup in Brazil, the BOA is not leaving anything to chance. Organisers say they are determined to ensure the UK’s Olympic athletes are given every opportunity to repeat the 69 medal haul won in last year’s London Games and exceed expectations in the 2016 international arena in Rio. The search for a suitable location in Brazil begun over a year ago as the Olympic flame in London was extinguished. It involved extensive studies and investigations into over a dozen different locations and venues across the South American country. Simon Timson, director of performance for UK Sport, said: 'Team GB and the BOA have worked incredibly hard and left no stone unturned to try to find the right venue in the right location within Brazil to ensure that we can have one team on one mission best prepared for Rio. 'The club is an hour from Rio, in the same time zone and has the same climate. 'You only have to walk around to see that it is going to provide a world class environment for our athletes.' The 471,000-square metre athletics centre, which has more than 73,000 members, boasts world-class facilities in nine different sports - basketball, men and women’s volleyball, swimming, judo, trampoline, gymnastics, tennis and futsal. Team GB's track and field competitors will be able to travel to the nearby Minas Gerais Federal University to use the nine-lane athletics track and impressive field facilities. 'Exciting': At the ceremony, Lord Coe said: 'This is a very exciting day for Team GB and an important moment as we build the bridge from London 2012 to Rio 2016' Practice: An elite athlete practises trampolining at the centre in the southern-central state of Minas Gerais . Incredible: The centre has state-of-the-art facilities in nine sports, including men's and women's basketball . 'We are extremely proud to be chosen to . host Team GB during their preparations for the Olympics,' said Antônio . Anastasia, state governor of Minas Gerais, during a signing ceremony . with Lord Coe on Wednesday. 'This is the first agreement signed in the country between an international sporting body and a city, and state. 'We are satisfied that we will be able to provide our guests with first-rate conditions.' Marcio Lacerda, mayor of Belo Horizonte, added: 'The high level of British professional athletes training on our home ground will inspire our own athletes to strive for their best during the Olympics and spur our youngsters on to take up sports.' Karen Robers, team leader for UK Judo and former judo champion, said the training facility was 'fantastic'. Handy: It is nearby to a nine-lane athletics track - ideal for Team GB's sprinters and long-distance runners . Suitable for all: An elite team of athletes play volleyball at the Minas Tênis Club . 'The facilities are exceptional,' she said. 'As we walked into the centre it felt so professional. 'It’s going to be like going from home to home for our professional athletes. 'They’ll want to come here and feel like they will be able to fit in straight away and they’ll have no problem doing that.' The . Minas Tênis Clube is already home to national and South American . championship teams in swimming, volleyball and basketball - with the . 2012 London Olympic Bronze medal winner in judo training on its . premises. As well as serving as an Olympic base, Belo Horizonte was one of the host cities for the Confederations Cup in June this year.

Training: Brazilian youngsters train in judo at the world-class facility, which will welcome Team GB in 2016 . It is also set to host six matches during next year's World Cup. The city was famously the site of one of the greatest upsets in British sporting history when England lost a 1950 World Cup pool match to rank underdogs the United States. Millions of dollars are currently being invested in the construction of around 29 new hotels to accommodate the anticipated influx of visitors during the World Cup and Olympics. Major infrastructure work involving new roadways and bus routes for the FIFA games are also ongoing causing disruptive traffic jams on the roads. However, the host city is confident that the problems will be resolved in time for the international sporting events.","Team GB athletes will train at Minas Tênis Club in Belo Horizonte, Brazil .

David Cameron is to unveil a new generation of apprenticeships to make vocational training more academically challenging for youngsters. The Prime Minister was due to visit the Mini factory in Oxford today to announce the 100,000 vocational training schemes for young people over the next two years. In the future, apprenticeships will last at least a year and will be based on standards designed by employers, to meet the specific needs of their industry. The apprentices will also leave with the knowledge to be fully competent in an occupation. David Cameron, pictured during a previous visit to the Mini plant, will return to the Oxford factory today to unveil a new generation of apprenticeships designed to make vocational training more academically challenging . But apprentices will also be subjected to more thorough academic assessments - including English and maths tests. At least 20 per cent of their training will take place away from their work stations. Downing Street said it was intended that all new apprenticeships will meet the new standards by 2017/18. The new scheme has been developed in response to last November’s report by entrepreneur Doug Richard, which called for higher quality training and more educational rigour to give apprenticeships ‘serious kudos’ with both employers and employees. More than 60 companies - including Mini owners BMW, BAE Systems, Microsoft and Barclays Bank - have signed up to be ‘trailblazers’ for the new-style apprenticeships. More than 60 companies - including Mini owners BMW, BAE Systems, Microsoft and Barclays Bank - have signed up to be 'trailblazers' for the new-style apprenticeships . Mr Cameron is expected to say: ‘I said earlier this month that I want us to deal with the scourge of youth unemployment by giving young people more chances and choices in life. This goes to the heart of my vision for this country: backing hard working people who want to get on in life and making sure Britain competes and thrives in the global race.’ He will add: ‘If you want an apprenticeship, we’re going to make sure you do the best apprenticeship in the world. The reforms we’re announcing today will put employers in the driving seat and ensure that we deliver high quality training that supports you and our economy for years to come. And as the range of companies signed up today shows, these are apprenticeships in different industries and sectors meaning people have a real choice about the career they want and our economy is balanced.’ Mr Cameron will also say: ‘If you need help preparing for an apprenticeship or want to get straight into the world of work, we’ll help you too. We’ve been talking to some of the biggest companies in Britain, massive global brands where young people have a real opportunity to progress up the ladder, and they have said they want to offer 100,000 vocational training schemes for young people.’ In the future, apprenticeships will last at least a year and will be based on standards designed by employers, to meet the specific needs of their industry . The Prime Minister will concede that the new apprenticeships are not a cure-all and will not ‘abolish youth unemployment overnight’. ‘But this is a massive step forward for young people and for our country.’ New vocational training schemes are being pledged by Accenture, BAE Systems, Barclays, BT, Centrica, Diageo, GSK, HSBC, Kingfisher, M&S, National Grid, Tesco, Unilever, and WPP, and will include intensive vocational training, mentoring and on-the-job experience. The scheme is being modelled on those run by the Prince’s Trust. A spokesman from The Prince’s Trust said: ‘Too many young people are facing long-term unemployment, believing their destiny lies in the dole queue. Prince’s Trust programmes are proven to help unemployed young people into jobs. Now, this backing from some of Britain’s biggest businesses will support thousands more disadvantaged young people into work.’","Prime Minister will visit Mini factory in Oxford to announce scheme .

He has bowel cancer but plans to climb the Alps next year for charity . A disabled pensioner who lost both his legs as a teenager has defied expectations by climbing more than 100 mountains. Norman Croucher OBE, 72, has scaled some of the world’s most brutal peaks in ranges including the Alps and the Himalayas. A keen climber from a young age, doctors told him he would have to sacrifice his hobby when, at the age of 19, he had both his legs amputated after falling onto railway tracks into the path of an oncoming train. But despite warnings from friends and family, he refused to give up - and has spent the 53 years since taking on death-defying mountain climbs. The smallest ascent he has scaled was more than 8,200 feet tall - and he has even tackled a 26,000-foot summit in the Himalayas. Despite recently been diagnosed with cancer, he has vowed to carry on. Mr Croucher, of Exeter, Devon, who is now preparing himself for a charity expedition to the Alps, describes his hobby as an addiction. He said: 'Climbing is an addiction. I say, life’s like a muscle and if you don’t stretch it, it’ll waste away and climbing for me is like stretching the muscle of life. 'It gives me something to aim for. I’m going to be less active for a while, but I’ll be okay for the trip next year.' Mr Croucher started climbing trees during his rehabilitation stint and as soon as he got his prosthetics he took to scaling the cliffs near his home on England's southern coast. Death-defying: Here he climbs a 17,880-ft mountain in Tocllaraju, Peru. The smallest he has scaled was 8,200ft . Passion: Despite warnings from doctors, family and friends, he continued after losing his legs in 1960 . Beneficial: Mr Croucher says amputated legs are useful in climbing - less body heat to lose, less weight to lift . Accident: This picture of Norman, 17, was taken two years before he was hit by an oncoming train . The pensioner has now climbed mountains . around the world including the Matterhorn, the Eiger and Mont Blanc in . the Alps and the White Needle in the Kashmiri Himalayas. He can also add Muztagh Ata in China and the sixth highest mountain in the world, Cho Oyo in Tibet, to his impressive list of conquests. Mr Croucher said that not having any legs wasn’t always a disadvantage and in some ways he felt it had helped him when climbing. He said: 'Because there’s less of me and I have a shorter blood circuit, I oxygenate better. 'So I may be slower on the lower mountain but then among the first party at the top. 'And because there’s less body surface to lose heat from, I keep warmer as well so often I’m more comfortable that the others. 'And there are advantages on long distance flights too. 'I can take my legs off and stretch out over two seats and have quite a good sleep.' Norman was awarded an OBE for his work promoting adventurous sports for disabled people. He fought against those who held the view that only mainstream competitive sports were suitable for disabled people. All over the world: He has climbed towering rocks near Bude, Cornwall (left), and Africa's Kilimanjaro (right) Rewarded: Mr Croucher received an OBE for his support of disabled people in sport. He could not understand why amputees couldn't climb world wonders everywhere from Peru's Alpamayo (left) to Cornwall's cliffs (right) Records: Mr Croucher, a retired social worker, was the first amputee to walk John O'Groats to Land's End in 1969 . He went on to prove that sailing, tobogganing and zip wiring were all still accessible for those with disabilities. And in 1969, he also became the first person fitted with artificial limbs to walk the 900 miles from John O’Groats to Lands End. In June, with two friends, Mr Croucher will take on two or three 11,500-ft peaks around Chamonix in the French Alps to raise funds for Exeter Hospiscare.","Norman Croucher OBE, lost his legs when he fell in front of a train aged 19 .

"By . David Rose . PUBLISHED: . 16:04 EST, 19 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:46 EST, 20 October 2013 . The Mail on Sunday has delivered a decisive blow against the creeping new culture of ‘secret justice’ after forcing the disclosure of a classified High Court judgment about torture in Afghanistan. After a ten-month legal battle, we can at last reveal horrifying allegations over the treatment of prisoners captured by British forces in Afghanistan – evidence the Ministry of Defence wanted to keep secret. We can now report that British officials, with the express approval of Labour Foreign Secretary David Miliband, were duped into handing over one particular detainee to the Afghan security service. The newly disclosed judgment reveals how he told that he was beaten with steel rods, whipped with electric cables and deprived of sleep for days – and showed the scars to prove it. Critics of secret justice said the new revelations indicate the MoD resorted to a secret hearing to cover their own embarrassment at handing the detainee over – and not to protect both his own and the UK’s national interest, as they claimed. Crucially, the breakthrough is the first time parts of a formerly secret judgment have been published.Even more significantly, it concerns the very case which inspired the Government to introduce this year’s hugely controversial Justice and Security Act – the law which formally enshrines secret hearings and secret judgments in the legal system, a radical departure from centuries of tradition. Ever since it was first mooted, this newspaper has campaigned to expose the threat to democracy and openness that secret courts represent. The High Court decision last week to allow publication of some  of the secret Afghan prisoner judgment is the first victory in that campaign. The battle began in April 2010. Maya Evans, a peace campaigner, asked the High Court to stop transfers of prisoners captured by British forces to the Afghan security service, the NDS, on the grounds they would be tortured. The court, led by Lord Justice Richards, responded in part with a judgment that was public: It said that transfers to NDS jails in Kandahar and Lashkar Gar in Helmand could continue as long as British forces ‘monitored’ prisoners’ fates. But it added that no more prisoners should be sent to the NDS in Kabul. Critically, the reasons for making this distinction were contained in a second secret judgment. The reasons can only now be published, after the MoS successfully challenged the continuing secrecy. Decision: Lord Justice Richards responded in part with a judgement that was public . We can reveal the secret ruling concerns a supposed Taliban leader, described only as Detainee 806. When . he was held by UK troops in January 2010, there was already a . moratorium banning the transfer of prisoners to the NDS in Kabul, . because its interrogation centre there – codenamed Department 17 – had . gained a sinister reputation for torture and British forces found it . impossible to gain access. The . now-declassified judgment states that Dr Amrullah Saleh, the NDS chief, . persuaded UK officials to hand over Detainee 806, after giving his . personal assurance that he would be cared for humanely and would be . allowed weekly visits from the British. According to a witness statement by a . senior Foreign Office official which also was not disclosed in 2010, the . ultimate decision to comply with Dr Saleh’s request was taken by Labour . Foreign Secretary David Miliband and Armed Forces Minister Bill . Rammell, on the grounds that the prisoner could more easily be . prosecuted in Kabul – so breaching their own moratorium. But as the judgment now reveals, Dr . Saleh’s promises proved worthless. Once in Kabul, Detainee 806 . ‘disappeared’ for a month. When he did finally meet two British Army . personnel, he told them he had been beaten with steel rods about his . legs and feet, punched in the head, torso, arms and testicles, and . deprived of sleep for days. On a subsequent visit, he said he had also been whipped with electric cables. Some of his injuries were photographed. Triumph over secret justice: Mail on Sunday's critical victory . Public concern: Home Secretary David Davis said David Miliband (pictured) 'broke our own moratorium and handed over a prisoner to be tortured' which he says 'is a clear matter of public concern, which using a secret court covered up' 'Far from protecting national security, this was about hiding political embarrassment' says former shadow Home Secretary David Davis (pictured) In 2010, the MoD asked for the evidence and judgment in the case to stay secret to ‘protect national security’ and preserve relations with the Afghan government. They also said disclosure might put prisoners at risk of reprisals. But last night former shadow Home Secretary David Davis said: ‘Far from protecting national security, this was about hiding political embarrassment.’ He added: ‘The fact David Miliband broke our own moratorium and handed over a prisoner to be tortured is a clear matter of public concern, which using a secret court covered up. This is a very bad harbinger for the secret justice procedures which the new Act creates.’ This newspaper’s lawyers, led by Dinah Rose QC, argued that full disclosure was in the public interest. However, parts of the judgment – we do not even know how much – are still secret. The High Court also refused our request to lay down guidelines to ensure future secret judgments are regularly reviewed, to allow publication as soon as possible. An MoD spokeswoman said the ministry was happy that parts of the secret judgment had been disclosed, but added: ‘There are exceptional cases in which closed proceedings are necessary to safeguard national security.’ Neither Mr Miliband nor Mr Rammell responded to MoS requests  for comment. Whipped: An illustration showing how Detainee 806 suffered in Kabul . It must have been a perilous operation: A raid  by British forces on a Taliban stronghold which resulted in the capture of an alleged insurgent leader – the man who would be described as Detainee 806. His true identity remains unknown. What is certain is that by early January 2010, he was a prisoner at the British base Camp Bastion, the sprawling fortress north-west of Lashkar Gar, the capital of Helmand province – the killing field where more than 400 UK service personnel have died. There, his living conditions were civilised, with access to showers and exercise. But British forces cannot legally hold Taliban prisoners indefinitely. If Detainee 806 were not to be freed, he had to be prosecuted under Afghan law. For this there was a well-established routine, starting with the prisoner’s transfer to the Lashkar Gar branch of the NDS, the Afghan Security Service. But instead, says the once-secret High Court judgment which The Mail on Sunday had declassified last week, Detainee 806 was consigned to the NDS in Kabul – despite the fact Britain had officially banned all transfers there since 2008, because of the risk they would be tortured. The decision was ultimately taken by the then Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, and the Armed Forces Minister,  Bill Rammell. This, says the judgment, issued in its secret form in April 2010, followed ‘specific reassurances’ from the NDS chief Amrullah Saleh that ‘[the prisoner] would be treated humanely and that UK officials would be given full access to him.’ 'Reassurances': NDS chief Amrullah Saleh, (pictured here speaking during a gathering in Kabul) said the prisoner 'would be treated humanely' Dr Saleh was a plausible, highly regarded figure: educated and a contributor to newspapers such as the Wall Street Journal. He was also vehemently anti-Taliban. However, his assurances were bogus. After Detainee 806 was transferred to Kabul on January 15, the judgment goes on, ‘British Embassy staff experienced considerable difficulty with gaining access .  .  . They contacted the NDS on an almost daily basis. It was not possible to visit the detainee until February 14, almost a month after he had been transferred by the UK.’ The judgment adds: ‘The UK’s repeated efforts to secure a visit were blocked by a series of unsatisfactory excuses .  .  . UK officials were given the runaround until questioning of Detainee 806 had been completed, and this was done despite the specific assurances given prior to his transfer.’ When two British Army personnel finally did get to see him, he was being held at Department 17, a notorious NDS interrogation centre – a place Dr Saleh had promised he would not be taken to. He told the officers he had been ‘beaten with steel rods to the area of his legs and feet, causing bruising and bleeding to his toes (he claimed he could not walk or stand after the beating); he had been punched on his face; and his testicles had been punched, grabbed and rubbed .  .  . he had been subjected to sleep deprivation and had been made to stand up for five consecutive nights.’ The NDS, he added, ‘had told him that if he reported any abuse to “the foreigners” he would be beaten or killed.’ The officers took photographs  of his injuries. The following evening Dr Saleh told them Detainee 806’s interrogation had been a great success: He had ‘been very forthcoming, without any pressure from the NDS.’ Two weeks later, the British visited the prisoner again. This time, he said he had been  slapped, punched, and whipped, ‘with what he described as electrical wiring about 24in long.’ The secret judgment said the judges could not determine the prisoner’s credibility. But it added: ‘We consider that the only safe way to proceed is on the assumption that the allegations are true.’ Nevertheless, the judges said in 2010 that there was no good reason to make his claims public: ‘The public interest considerations in favour of non-disclosure ought in our view to prevail.’ The judgment contains details of threats and torture endured by other prisoners, including another man allegedly beaten with cables. All of them, until this newspaper went to court, would have stayed secret indefinitely. ‘The judgment shows the British government knew detainees were being tortured,  yet this information was withheld from the public,’ Richard Stein, the solicitor who represented The Mail on Sunday, said yesterday. ‘We are moving into an era when more and more of our justice system is going to  unfold in secret – and yet there isn’t even a mechanism for ensuring that judgments such  as this eventually enter the  public domain.’ The Ministry of Defence has asked the court to order this newspaper to pay its costs – a  sum which could easily exceed £20,000. We are fighting this demand.","Landmark ruling reveals Government used judges to cover up torture blunder .

"By . Paul Bentley . PUBLISHED: . 20:20 EST, 27 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:00 EST, 28 October 2013 . Snatched: Two of the Tower of London's famous ravens have been killed by a fox. Legend has it that six ravens must guard the Tower of London at all times or the monarchy will fall. So security has been beefed up at the Norman fortress after a fox killed two of the treasured birds, leaving the minimum number required to save the Crown. The ravens, named Grip and Jubilee, were snatched just before they were due to be locked up in their cages overnight. Fortunately there were two spare birds at the Tower to keep the numbers up. A spokesman for Historic Royal Palaces, the charity that cares for the birds, said it had been a ‘lucky escape’ because the hungry fox had almost taken the number of ravens below six. The dead birds were found by keepers at dusk and tests showed they were killed by a fox. Grip was named after the raven in Charles Dickens’s Barnaby Rudge that inspired a poem by Edgar Allan Poe, while Jubilee was chosen to honour the Queen. The two new birds brought in as replacements have been given the same names. Catherine Steventon, of Historic Royal Palaces, said: ‘The ravens are put to bed each evening in secure enclosures to  minimise these risks, however sadly a fox captured two of the ravens before they were put to bed. 'At dusk we couldn’t find them. Eventually, they were found within the inner walls… Currently we have eight ravens at the Tower. The legend mentions six ravens and we like to have two extra.’ In light of the attacks, Historic Royal Palaces has increased security and reviewed pest control measures. The legend of the ravens of the Tower is said to have begun under the reign of Charles II, who insisted that they should  be protected. Guardians: The tower's ravens are cared for by the Beefeaters . Historic: The ravens are rumoured to have first been protected on order of Charles II . Watchers: A raven can be seen looking over Beefeaters at the Tower in 1996 . The birds, known as ‘guardians of the Tower’, are very well looked after, eating a diet of meat from Smithfield market, biscuits soaked in blood, and salt and vinegar crisps as a treat. An annual budget of £4,000 is set aside for their care. Most ravens in the wild have a life expectancy of 12 years but those in the Tower – who have their wings clipped to stop them flying away – usually live past their 25th birthday, with some reaching 40. Current residents Hugine, Erin, Merlin, Munin, Portia, Rocky, Jubilee and Grip will this winter see their home refurbished for the first time in 20 years. Taken: The ravens, named Grip and Jubilee, were snatched just before they were due to be locked up in their cages at the Tower overnight . They are allowed to roam on the south lawn and Tower Green during the day but are locked up at night. From next year, they will have modern cages with a secure area. The fox attack occurred in May and only came to light after a freedom of information request. Fortunately, no other ravens have been killed since but two died naturally and a third bird was dismissed for eating TV aerials. They have all been replaced. Legend has it that wild ravens have lived in the Tower of London for more than five hundred years. The birds are notorious scavengers and could have been attracted to the fortress by the smell given off by the corpses of those who had been executed. There are accounts of the carnivorous animals looking grimly on at the executions of Anne Bolyen and Lady Jane Grey - both wives of Tudor king Henry VIII. Superstitions that the ravens staying at the tower is the key to the nation's survival are thought to have originated around the 17th Century, when reigning monarch Charles II took the legend seriously enough to have the birds protected. Tradition: Two ravens pictured in the Tower in the 1960s . One story tells that the king complained to his Royal Astronomer, John Flamsteed, that the birds were leaving unsightly droppings on his telescope, and that he wanted them removed. But when he was told of the legend that the ravens were linked to the survival of the monarchy - which had only just been restored after the death of Oliver Cromwell - he declared that the ravens should have their wings clipped and be kept in the Tower to ensure their survival. As a compromise, he also decided to move the Royal Observatory to Greenwich. Another account say that Charles II first protected the ravens after the people of the capital began attacking them for scavenging in the destruction left by the Great Fire of London in 1666. In modern times, the ravens have one of their wings clipped, which means they can fly for short distances but cannot escape the fortress. The birds are officially enlisted as soldiers in the Army, and there are records of individuals being dismissed from their 'duties' at the Tower for unsatisfactory conduct. Close bond: A Raven Master meets a young bird at the Tower in the 1980s . Each raven has a coloured band on its leg to make it easier to identify the birds, which are commonly cited as being the one of the most common reasons for visiting the Tower, second only to the Crown Jewels. As well as their diet of premium meat, the birds are also feed cheese, boiled eggs, fruit and even vitamin supplements to keep them healthy. They are also dutifully protected from the outside world - a report from 2005 showed that crows around the Tower were being shot to protect the birds from disease and competition for food - while in the 2006 bird flu scare, they were given a special protective enclosure. However, some historians claim that the tradition of keeping ravens in the Tower is much less well-established than previously thought. In 2004 Dr Geoff Parnell, an historian at the Tower, searched the record books for the earliest mention of kept ravens, and could find nothing dating from earlier than 1895. Also in the records that did exist, it was occasionally stated that 'there are none' of the ravens left - suggesting their fabled link to Britain's destiny may not be as strong as first thought.","Security beefed up at Norman fortress after fox kills two birds .

Stan Garnett said he didn't know if he would have pursued John and Patsy Ramsey after their six-year-old daughter's body was found strangled and beaten at her family home in Boulder, Colorado, in 1996. Claiming she had been murdered by an unknown intruder, they were never charged because former District Attorney Alex Hunter refused to sign the document to prosecute them, citing a lack of evidence. But newly-unsealed grand jury documents revealed last week that Mr and Mrs Ramsey were indicted in 1999 for child abuse by putting her in a situation that ultimately led her to her death. Scroll down for video . Loss: Six-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was killed in 1996, was abused by her parents until she died, a grand jury concluded in 1999. But despite their indictment, her parents were not prosecuted over her death . And today the district attorney of . Boulder County Stan Garnett: 'I don’t know if I would have made the same . decision, but I know how difficult these decisions are.' The grand jury documents released in Boulder, Colorado on Friday were compiled long . before DNA evidence led the DA to . publicly exonerate the Ramseys in 2008. Garnett . said he learned of the sealed documents when he took office in 2009, . but a review showed that the statute of limitations had run out on the . charges. 'My staff evaluated . the Ramsey case to determine if there was any charge for which the . statute of limitations had not run and for which there was conclusive . evidence,' Garnett wrote in a lengthy opinion piece in the Boulder Daily Camera. 'Because there was none, we focused on other matters (including four murders we tried in 2009, two of which were cold cases).' 'I don't know': Boulder District Attorney Stan Garnett, left, said he wasn't sure if he would have done the same as his predecessor Alex Hunter, right, in refusing to prosecute JonBenet's parents . Indicted: . John and Patsy Ramsey, who are pictured in 2004, were accused of . putting their daughter in a situation that ultimately led to her death. Mrs Ramsey died from ovarian cancer in 2006 . The released indictments 'are nonsensical,' said the Ramsey's attorney L. Lin Wood on Friday. 'They reveal nothing about the evidence reviewed by the grand jury and are clearly the result of a confused and compromised process. The Ramsey family and the public are entitled to the benefit of the full and complete record, not just a historical footnote. Fairness dictates that result.' She added: 'The . DNA was not available to the grand jury in 1999. 'What we have here is a release of a sliver of the . evidence that the grand jury looked at and reviewed. It's just based on . incomplete evidence.' The parents of JonBenet Ramsey were both indicted with child abuse resulting in death and acting as an accessory to a crime by the grand jury in 1999. On the child abuse charge, the grand jury wrote that John and Patsy Ramsey 'did unlawfully, knowingly, recklessly and feloniously permit a child to be unreasonably placed in a situation which posed a threat of injury to the child's life or health, which resulted in the death of JonBenet Ramsey.' On a second count of accessory to a crime, the grand jury wrote that each parent 'did render assistance to a person' with the intent to prevent their arrest or prosecution 'knowing they had committed and was suspected of the crime of murder in the first degree and child abuse resulting in death' A . reporter for The Camera and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the . Press had filed a lawsuit to seek the records and the documents were . released on Friday after a ruling by a Colorado judge . In . the four-page document, one of the counts read that they 'did . unlawfully, knowingly, recklessly and feloniously permit a child to be . unreasonably placed in a situation which posed a threat of injury to the . child's life or health, which resulted in the death of JonBenét . Ramsey.' Even though the . grand jury voted to go ahead with the charges in 1999, the DA had . declined to proceed over fears he could not prove guilt without a . reasonable doubt, the Daily Camera reported. The body of JonBenet, a child beauty queen, was found bludgeoned . and strangled in her family's home in Boulder on December 26, 1996, hours after she was reported missing. Her . parents had called police to report her kidnapping and said they found a . note demanding a ransom of $118,000 for her safe return. After her death, her parents were . placed under an 'umbrella of suspicion', an investigator said, but in . 2008, the DA said that evidence suggested . the killer was a stranger, not a family member. Two years earlier, Mrs Ramsey had died after a long battle with ovarian cancer. The statute of limitations for the abuse charges expired in 2002. The documents' release comes just days after . JonBenet's father said he didn't want secret grand jury indictments from . his daughter's case released to the public. John . Ramsey's attorneys had sent a letter to the Boulder County District . Attorney saying the release of such records without releasing the entire . grand jury record would only defame the parents. 'Public release of the allegations of . an un-prosecuted indictment only serves to further defame (John Ramsey) and his late wife Patricia,' the letter said, according to the Daily Camera. Help us find the killer: John Ramsey looks on during a 1997 television appearance as wife Patsy touts a reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the murderer of JonBenet . 'Mr. Ramsey will have no access to whatever evidence the prosecutors . presented to the grand jury and will have no ability to disprove those . allegations in a court of law. 'Nor will the public have any ability . to evaluate the propriety of the indictment unless the entire grand jury . record is unsealed and opened to public view.' But the judge ordered the current DA to . provide a reason why the documents should be kept secret. He provided them to a judge on Tuesday to determine if they were . suitable to be released. Officials told Mr Ramsey that they would only release the secret indictments in such a way that would not hinder potential future prosecution under charges where the statute of limitations has not yet expired. The judge also said that the court would not be permitted to release all of the information in the case. 'The court is sympathetic to the position of Mr. Ramsey,; Judge Robert Lowenbach said on Wednesday, but a release of the entire record ""would set a precedent that would impede other Grand Juries in performing their functions under statute and rule'.

Harassment: Ruby Cooper, pictured outside court in May, has been convicted of breaking restraining orders banning her from contacting RBS employees . A former bank worker who was arrested for sending poison to RBS chief executive Stephen Hester has escaped jail after being found guilty of harassment. Ruby Cooper breached a restraining order when she emailed the bank boss accusing him of conspiring against her and threatening to publicise his children's address. She also wrote an aggressive letter to prosecuting barrister Simon Blackford, claiming he was guilty of perverting the course of justice. Cooper, 52, was arrested in October last year after Mr Hester received a letter containing a vial of liquid which purported to be poison. She subsequently sent the RBS boss an email in which she accused him of framing her, writing: 'I intend to flush you out Mr Hester, as I believe it is you behind this. 'You tried repeatedly to have me framed and fitted up over the past few years. 'There are two options: either you fabricated the letter or there is a nutter out there who may attack a member of your staff. 'I intend to publish the address of where that person can find your children and your wife and your new wife on 19 November. If you have something to fear you will resolve this with me pronto. 'If you were behind this, you will not settle this case with me, so by November 19 I will know.' Cooper was arrested once again and charged with breaching a restraining order, and was found guilty by a jury earlier this year. She has not faced any charges related to the alleged poison which was sent to Mr Hester, who stepped down as the bank's chief executive earlier this month. Last month, Cooper emailed Mr Blackford, who represented the Crown Prosecution Service in her trial. 'Barrister and part-time judge Simon Blackford on behalf of the CPS in May 2013 perverted justice and allowed an abuse of process plus a few other dirty tricks to gain two convictions which he knows were gotten by the CPS by deceit. 'He knew that 78 crimes that I had reported had not been investigated properly and that the Met police tampered with evidence but did not stop the trial which he should have and yet this man is a judge.' Convicted: Cooper, left, repeatedly sent emails to Mr Hester, right, despite a court ban . As he handed Cooper a suspended prison sentence at Snaresbrook Crown Court, judge Martin Zeidman said: 'I had hoped that since her conviction she would have learnt a lesson - I am afraid she has caused a real disappointment. 'I was worried about the mental state of this defendant as she had told me she had suffered from depression and there is no doubt she has had a hard life. She is a highly intelligent and articulate person but I fear that she is suffering from some real problems. 'Since the last hearing there has been more material sent to the court with some of it being long-winded and polite and some have been of a more aggressive style. For example, an email addressed to me and Mr Blackford makes reference to ""Nazis"" - I take no personal insult, as she apologised the next day in yet another email. 'Also in reference to Mr Blackford there is some scandalous defamation on the defendant's website and I would just like to comment, he has acted to the highest standards of the bar throughout proceedings. 'I have no doubt she is not prepared to cooperate and see a psychiatrist and despite her undoubted good characteristics she does have, I fear that she is now just outside the prison door. 'I am going to make a restraining order in the real hope that she complies - I make absolutely clear any further breach and she will go to prison.' Grudge: Cooper had a vendetta against NatWest, owned by RBS, because of a run-in with an employee . Cooper was sentenced to three months in jail, suspended for two years, and is banned from contacting various public officials, including any director or former director of RBS, and anyone involved in her court case. The defendant must also pay £3,500 costs for bombarding the CPS with emails and will be under supervision for two years. Representing herself, Cooper said: 'My website is very emotive - I should imagine you have not had time to read all of it but every time I make a claim I show a document that proves they did pervert justice. 'The trial took place because the police would not help me. You have said that what I said is nonsense on the website and I have between 1994 and 2003 reported numerous crimes to the police which were never dealt with properly.' Cooper has spent nearly 20 years campaigning against the bank after being 'freaked out' by a member of NatWest's call centre staff who allegedly took her home address from the bank's computers and paid her repeated visits even after she moved home. Cooper, from Barnet in North London, continued to contact the bank about her concerns, and was convicted of harassing former chairman Sir David Rowland in 2000. She was then banned from contacting any employees of NatWest or RBS, or any police officers involved in her case. Privately educated Cooper, who has a degree in psychology and social anthropology from the University of Stirling, worked for NatWest - now part of RBS Group - from 1977-78. She said she had a turbulent upbringing, with divorced parents living in different countries threatening to kidnap her.","Ruby Cooper, 52, had a grudge against RBS over encounter with employee .

Cory Terry, 33, from Brooklyn, New York drank a can of Red Bull after a basketball game and then collapsed and died. His family is now suing the energy drinks company for $85million . His cause of death was idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy which meant his heart stopped. Mr Terry's relatives are blaming the company which makes the energy boosting beverage for his death. His grandmother Patricia Terry said her grandson drank Red Bull all the time. The complaint is believed to be the first of its kind against the company which makes energy drinks. Lawyer Ilya Novofastovsky told the New York Daily News that there are 'extra stimulants that make it different than a cup of coffee' which are 'more dangerous than Red Bull lets on'. Red Bull said it did not comment on individual cases but that health authorities across the world have said it is safe to drink. Mr Terry's relatives blame the energy drink company for the young father's death . His mother has said that Mr Terry, a construction worker from Bedford-Stuyvesant, drank Red Bull all the time. Novofastovsky said he hoped the lawsuit would raise people's awareness about the potential risks of energy drinks. In 2008 scientists said just one can of Red Bull could raise the risk of heart attack or a stroke. The study on university students found that drinking one 250ml can of even the sugar-free version, which has the slogan 'gives you wings', increased the 'stickiness of the blood and raised the risk of life-threatening clots. Researcher Dr Scott Willoughby said: 'One hour after they drank Red Bull, (their blood systems) were no longer normal. Dr Willoughby, of the Cardiovascular . Research Centre at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, said he was 'alarmed' at . the results and would not drink Red Bull himself.

A new law being introduced to protect teachers from malicious allegations of crimes against pupils could have hindered the hunt for Megan Stammers and Jeremy Forrest. The Education Act, which comes into force next week, gives anonymity to teachers accused of committing criminal offences against children at their school. The law was introduced amid fears over a number of false allegations of abuse or physical assault made by pupils and parents against teachers in recent years. Hunt: But under legislation to be introduced next week it might have been illegal to have named 15-year-old Megan Stammers (left)  who  fled to France with her teacher Jeremy Forrest . But the controversial legislation – enforced by fines of up to £5,000 – could have unintended implications in future cases similar to the hunt for missing Megan. Under Clause 13, anonymity ends only if the teacher is charged with a criminal offence or a court agrees to an application that it is in the interests of the justice that it should be lifted. Anonymity also ends if an arrest warrant is issued, but in Megan’s case that didn’t happen until Tuesday – four days after her disappearance was reported to police. The 15-year-old boarded a cross-Channel ferry with Mr Forrest last Thursday night meaning, under the new law, that a crucial amount of time could have been lost . The 15-year-old boarded a cross-Channel . ferry with Mr Forrest last Thursday night meaning, under the new law, . that a crucial amount of time could have been lost before publicly . appealing for help in tracking  them down. Under the legislation, it might be illegal to have even named Megan or her school because by doing so it could lead to the identification of her teacher. Critics say the Bill could also mean that an accused teacher might move from one school to another without allegations being  properly recorded and aired if there is not a criminal charge. During the Bill’s passage concerned peers in the House of Lords described the new anonymity law as ‘an unprecedented attack on free speech’ and as the hunt for Megan intensified yesterday media organisations warned of the legislation’s ‘unintended consequences’. The Newspaper Society, which promotes the interests of Britain’s regional and local media, was among organisations lobbying against the new law. Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, said: ‘In trying to protect teachers from being falsely accused you are actually putting children at greater risk. Here they are trying to deal with one problem, teachers being falsely accused, by creating another. That is the law of unintended consequences.’ The Education Act 2011 comes into force on Monday and means that teachers become the first group of people in British legal history to be given automatic anonymity when they are accused of a criminal offence. The Society of Editors, in a letter to peers, warned that the measures would be a ‘gross inhibition on freedom of speech’, adding: ‘It would set a very dangerous precedent as people could be convicted for telling the truth.’ Mr Satchwell warned: ‘It will be a criminal offence for anyone – pupil, parent, police, school, local authority, whistle-blower, media – even to inform parents or the general public that an identified teacher has admitted that the allegation is true and has resigned, has been disciplined, or even cautioned for the offence.’ Missing: Schoolgirl Megan Stammers, 15, fled to France with her 30-year-old maths teacher . He added: ‘Although we acknowledge . teachers’ fears about false accusations, the most important issue is . surely to protect children. ‘Malicious . allegations by pupils are extremely rare and alongside this, the laws . of libel, contempt and confidence already restrict newspapers from . repeating and publishing unsubstantiated accusations.’ Under . the Act, anonymity can also end if the Education Secretary publishes . information about the teacher in connection with an investigation or . decision in a disciplinary case. The teacher may also waive his or her . anonymity.","The Education Act comes into force next week .

Researchers discovered chimpanzees and bonobo monkeys exhibit emotional responses to outcomes of decision-making. Like some humans, chimpanzees and bonobos pout or throw angry tantrums when a risk-taking strategy fails to pay off, according to research. American researchers Alexandra Rosati, of Yale University, and Brian Hare, of Duke University, assessed the emotional responses and motivation of chimpanzees and bonobos living in African sanctuaries. These chimpanzees were study subjects at the Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Sanctuary in Pointe Noire, Republic of Congo. Researchers discovered chimpanzees and bonobo monkeys exhibit emotional responses to outcomes of decision-making. Doctor Rosati said: 'Psychologists and economists have found that emotions play a critical role in shaping how humans make complex decisions, such as decisions about saving or investing money. 'But it was not known if these processes are shared with other animals when they make decisions about their important resources - such as food.' The apes in the study faced two different types of problems: one where they made choices about whether to wait to obtain larger rewards, and one where they made choices about whether to take a chance to obtain a high-quality treat, but risk obtaining a non-preferred food item if their gamble did not pay off. One of the bonobos who was a study subject at Lola ya Bonobo Sanctuary in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo . The scientists found that both species displayed emotional responses to the outcome of their choice, but chimpanzees were more patient and likely to take risks than bonobos. When their choice yielded the less preferred outcome, both species displayed negative emotional responses including vocalizations similar to pouts and moans, scratching, and banging - a type of tantrum thought to reflect anger in apes. In the risky choice task, the apes even tried to switch their choice after the fact when they realised they had made a losing gamble, but never did so when their risk-taking paid off. Some of the emotional and motivational responses displayed by the apes were species-specific while others reflected individual differences in the animals. Based on their results, published in the journal PLOS ONE, the researchers concluded that apes do exhibit emotional responses to decision-making, like humans. They said that further research is needed to determine whether these emotional responses to outcomes can change the apes' future choices and decisions.","Researchers studied chimpanzees and bonobos living in African sanctuaries .

In commemoration of the 100th Rose Bowl Game, an annual college football game, the All-Century Class will honor players and coaches throughout the game's history. It's unlikely Simpson, 66, will attend the January 1 ceremony. He is currently serving time in Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada for armed robbery and kidnapping. College era: OJ Simpson was tailback for the University of Southern California Trojans football team . The former champion footballer and sometime actor was named Player of the Game in the 1968 Rose Bowl in which he ran 128 years and scored two touchdowns for the Trojans against Indiana. His illustrious sporting career was overshadowed by his sensational murder trial in 1994 for the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. The eight-month trial ended with Simpson's acquittal. In September 2007, he was arrested in Las Vegas on kidnapping and armed robbery charges. He was found guilty in 2008 and sentenced to 33 years in prison with a minimum of nine years without parole. Controversial: OJ Simpson's eight-month murder trial was heavily publicized . Serving time: Simpson is now in prison serving nine-to-33 years for his 2008 conviction on kidnapping and armed robbery charges . According to CBS, Simpson's manager, Norman Pardo, has said his client is interested in pursuing a career as a televangelist once he is released from prison. Simpson had a successful acting career following his returement from football, starring in mini-series, major films and hosting Saturday Night Live. The first Rose Bowl Game was played in 1902, and since then has earned the nickname The Granddaddy of Them All. It's usually played on January 1 each year at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Since 1945, it has been the most-attended college football bowl game. Nominated alongside Simpson are former USC football coach John McKay and former Wisconsin quarterback Ron VanderKelen.","OJ Simpson is nominated as a finalist for the Rose Bowl Game All-Century Class .

Two fossilised footprints made around 105 million years ago are believed to be the oldest known bird tracks in Australia. Scientists believe the prints found in a place called Dinosaur Cove were likely made by birds during the Early Cretaceous period. The journal Palaeontology reports that much of the rocky coastal strata of Dinosaur Cove in southern Victoria were formed in river valleys in a polar climate during the Early Cretaceous. The Cretaceous bird tracks were found on a slab of sandstone. Scientists believe the prints found in a place called Dinosaur Cove were likely made by birds during the Early Cretaceous period . A great rift valley formed as the ancient supercontinent Gondwana broke up and Australia separated from Antarctica. ‘These tracks are evidence that we had sizeable, flying birds living alongside other kinds of dinosaurs on these polar, river floodplains, about 105 million years ago,’ said Dr Anthony Martin, a paleontologist at Emory University in Atlanta. Dr Martin added that the thin-toed tracks in fluvial sandstone were likely made by two individual birds that were about the size of a great egret or a small hero. Great egrets measure between 80 to 104 cm (31 to 41 in) in length. Two fossilised footprints made around 105 million years ago are believed to be the oldest known bird tracks in Australia. This illustration shows how the flight landing track was probably made as a bird set down on the moist sand of a river bank . Rear-pointing toes helped distinguish the tracks as avian, as opposed to a third nearby fossil track that was discovered at the same time, made by a non-avian theropod. A long drag mark on one of the two bird tracks particularly interested Dr Martin who said: ‘I immediately knew what it was - a flight landing track - because I’ve seen many similar tracks made by egrets and herons on the sandy beaches of Georgia.’ Dinosaur Cove has yielded a rich trove of non-avian dinosaur bones from dozens of species, but only one skeletal piece of a bird – a fossilised wishbone – has been found in the Cretaceous rocks of Victoria. Dr Martin spotted the first known dinosaur trackway of Victoria in 2010 and a few other tracks have been discovered since then. A drag mark made by rear toe on one of the Cretaceous bird tracks indicates that it was a flight landing track . The tracks were made on the moist sand of a river bank, perhaps following a polar winter, after spring and summer flood waters had subsided. ‘The biggest question for me,’ said Dr Martin, ‘is whether the birds that made these tracks lived at the site during the polar winter, or migrated there during the spring and summer.’ One of the best records of the dinosaur-bird connection has come from discoveries in Liaoning province of Northeastern China, including fossils of non-avian dinosaurs with feathers. Samples of amber have also been found in Liaoning, containing preserved feathers from both birds and non-avian dinosaurs going back to the Cretaceous. ‘In contrast, the picture of early bird evolution in the Southern Hemisphere is mostly incomplete,’ said Dr Martin. ‘but with these tracks, it just got a little better.’ The journal Palaeontology reports that much of the rocky coastal strata of Dinosaur Cove in southern Victoria were formed in river valleys in a polar climate during the Early Cretaceous .","Rear-pointing toes distinguished the tracks found on sandstone as avian .

A leading Boston-based obesity surgeon has been suspended amid accusations of negligence in his treatment of four patients - two of whom subsequently died. Dr. Sheldon Randall was declared an ‘immediate and serious threat’ to the public by the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine panel, which recently suspended his medical license. The board found that Randall, 61, had failed to meet adequate standards of care by not recognizing and treating post-surgery complications quickly enough in the four cases cited. Dr. Sheldon Randall, a Boston-based leading obesity surgeon, has been suspended amid accusations of negligence . Prior to his suspension, Randall had been long considered an expert in his field. He had performed more than 6,000 weight-loss operations in his 30-year career - nearly one every weekday - and his bariatric surgery programs had been designated national centers of excellence by surgeons’ groups. Randall has denied the allegations against him and is appealing his suspension. His legal team claim he provided good care for this patients and four prominent Harvard physicians have written letters to the board supporting him. Scott Ferullo, a 45-year-old construction worker, underwent open gastric bypass surgery carried out by Randall and died four days later in terrible pain . His suspension only came about after a . protracted series of events which exposes serious communications . problems between hospitals and the medical board over issues such as . disciplinary actions, reports The Boston Globe. Although two of Randall’s employers - Hallmark Health System and Winchester Hospital – suspended him in March 2012, he continued working for a third - MetroWest Medical Center – for another right up until several days before the board took away his license in August of this year. It was during that 17-month period, that the board alleges that Randall negligently cared for two gastric bypass patients at MetroWest, including a 67-year-old woman who died after her surgery. In her case, the board said Randall failed to quickly evaluate her for a bowel obstruction when she began vomiting several days after surgery. The medical board began investigating Randall in Spring 2012, not long after he had operated on Scott Ferullo, a 45-year-old construction worker. Biomedical illustration of bariatric surgery: Randall's suspension only came about after a protracted series of events which exposes serious communications problems between hospitals and the medical board over issues such as disciplinary actions against doctors .

Investigators said Randall failed to promptly investigate whether his patient had a leak or bleeding at the surgery site. Hallmark suspended Randall that day and he resigned permanently in November 2012 - two and a half months before the 67-year-old MetroWest patient died.

A physician and national expert on the world of zombie neuroscience sparked fury among listeners of a radio show when he pretended that a zombie invasion was really happening – and people believed him. Dr Steven Schlozman, an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Lecturer in Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, was interviewed on the radio show, Coast to Coast, hosted by Ian Punnett. Schlozman was on the show in 2011 to talk about his book, The Zombie Autopsies: Secret Notebooks From the Apocalypse, which was released that year. Scroll down to listen... Zombie 'scientist': Steven Schlozman spoke about his book, The Zombie Autopsies: Secret Notebooks From the Apocalypse, on a radio show as though it were based on true events . Fun and games: The host of Coast to Coast, Ian Punnett, left, is known for his radio show's format in which interviewees pretend they are talking about real-life events when speaking about their science fiction novels. He interviewed Schlozman about his 2011 book, The Zombie Autopsies: Secret Notebooks from the Apocalypse . Zombie attack: A scene from the first episode in the new season of The Walking Dead. Listeners thought that zombies were invading earth after hearing the radio show . In an article he wrote on Sunday for the New York Times, the physician and author writes about the experience and why he thinks people believe in hoaxes. The radio programme is known for its format, in which Punnett takes a creepy work of outlandish fiction and interviews the author as if what he’d written were actually true. Schlozman wasn’t even the first zombie author to be featured: Max Brooks discussed his novel World War Z with Punnett in much the same format. According to Schlozman, the Coast to Coast broadcasts are entertaining and not a little unsettling; the late-night venue probably adds to the verisimilitude. 'Everything is just that much easier to believe when you’re listening alone in the dark,' says Schlozman. On the show Punnett asked him to help make sense of a new and 'terrifying threat' to our planet. Same same: Max Brooks discussed his novel World War Z with Punnett on the radio show in much the same format, pretending it was a real story . So, Schlozman told him about a 'newly-uncovered disease' that he had learned about from a manuscript penned by a doctor from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who had succumbed to a zombie plague while studying its origins. The disease was called Ataxic Neurodegenerative Satiety Deficiency syndrome (A.N.S.D.), Schlozman explained on air, saying that it might have been engineered by nefarious hedge-fund managers, in hopes that the stock market would plunge and become vulnerable to manipulations as the chaos spread. Schlozman says in the New York Times that he thought listeners knew he was messing with them. Instead, the show generated a ripple of genuine concern. Emails showed up in his inbox, and he got questions along the lines of: ‘What’s the best medicine to stave off the zombie infection?’ and ‘How do I keep my house safe from the zombie onslaught?’. Confusion: The show generated a ripple of genuine concern and some listeners believed the zombies were coming to take over the world. Zombies have become a cult culture for many people . ‘Some people who contacted me — and realised that we were fooling around — were furious that I had even toyed with such an idea in a public venue. One person went so far as to suggest that I had violated my Hippocratic oath,’ said Scholzman in piece he wrote for the New York Times. According to the physician, he felt surprised by the reactions. ‘I was, after all, talking about an exceedingly well known, undeniably frightening but nevertheless entirely fictional pop-culture phenomenon. I didn’t really expect anyone to take me seriously.’ What happened to Schlozman also happened to another, very well-known science fiction author, Orson Welles. On October 30, 1938, Welles performed a dramatic adaptation of the H. G. Wells classic War of the Worlds. Panic: Orson Welles broadcasts his radio show of H.G. Wells' science fiction novel The War of the Worlds in a New York studio in 1938. Many believed the realistic account of an invasion from Mars . It was the night before Halloween, and the young Welles’ program was ‘interrupted’ with an announcement from ‘Intercontinental Radio News’ that there had been a series of strange gas explosions on the planet Mars. From there, the world proceeded to end. ‘The show set off a wave of scattered but intense panic. And when listeners found out the invasion wasn’t real, boy, were they mad,’ said Schlozman. More than a thousand people wrote to the CBS network to complain, and the newly created Federal Communications Commission fielded more than 600 letters and telegrams. According to Schlozman, the Ataxic Neurodegenerative Satiety Deficiency syndrome, the disease that he simply made up, now has its own website, which he did not create himself. It appeared after he posted a fake medical paper online on the ‘putative virus that causes zombification’. Internet hoax: The 'website' of Dwayne Medical Center, created by multimedia artist Virgil Wong, led many to believe that men were having babies . The author said another example of people believing in hoaxes was the male pregnancy ruse in 2007/2008. This was roughly the time that the first male pregnancy was reported at the world-famous Dwayne Medical Center and word of the medical achievement spread virally online. However, there is no such place as the Dwayne Medical Center, and of course, there’s no male pregnancy among humans. The entire website was created by a multimedia artist named Virgil Wong. ‘It isn’t that hard to show this site to people naïve to the story and get them to believe it,’ said Schlozman. ‘As the noted skeptics Agents Mulder and Scully might suggest, the truth is out there. But when you search for it online, the truth may turn out to be whatever you need it to be.’ To listen to the full show on Coast to Coast click here .","Dr Steven Schlozman, a child psychiatrist, was on the radio show, Coast to Coast to talk about his book, The Zombie Autopsies: Secret Notebooks From the Apocalypse .

Three years ago I underwent the menopause at the age of 50, shortly after losing my dear sister to breast cancer (she was just 50). I started to experience hot flushes, night sweats and high anxiety but was reluctant to take HRT because of the family history of cancer — my mother also died from the disease aged 64. As an alternative, my chemist recommended red clover with isoflavones and green tea. Since my first tablets a few months ago my periods have returned and I am starting to feel myself again. But could a herbal remedy have such a profound effect — or have my periods come back due to me overcoming my grief? J. Lipman, Surrey. Herbal way to happy: There are several supplements on the market which mimics the effect of the body';s natural oestrogen . The symptoms of the menopause can be extremely debilitating — and I’m sorry to hear of your distress and bereavement. The symptoms — such as hot flushes —  occur because of lack of production of the female hormone oestrogen by the ovaries, which have reached the end of their reproductive life and are gradually shutting down. The changing hormone levels may affect the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that acts as the body’s thermostat, and send it out of kilter. Your decision to avoid hormone . replacement therapy, which is very effective at easing these symptoms, . was wise given your strong family history of breast cancer. There is . much evidence that some, if not most, breast cancers are stimulated by . the presence of oestrogen, and HRT consists mainly of this. Popping pills: Taking herbal supplements could have a positive effect . You ask whether the restoration of your monthly cycle and the dramatic resolution of your unpleasant menopausal symptoms are down to the herbal remedy and the easing of your grief. Given that it’s three years since your menopausal symptoms started, I suspect it’s the remedy rather than the psychological change that has been at work. The remedy has had an instant and powerful oestrogen-like effect, stopping the hot flushes and restoring your cycle, as well as having a magical reaction on your mood. There are several such natural substances available, and we refer to them as gonadomimetic — meaning that they mimic the effects of your own natural oestrogen. My concern is that in terms of cancer risk, we do not know for certain that such preparations are any safer than taking HRT. There is a view that if these products are natural, or herbal, then they must be safer. But there have been no large-scale trials to address that specific issue. I have real concerns over the safety of this compound. If the oestrogen-like substances in the red clover are strong enough to relieve the symptoms of the menopause so effectively, then there is a possibility that these compounds may also raise your risk of cancer. You must consider this matter very carefully given your family history, despite the great benefit you have obtained. There are non-oestrogen alternatives to HRT, including lifestyle measures (some evidence suggests that regular, gentle exercise such as swimming can reduce the hot flushes) and medication options. Some antidepressants may also decrease hot flushes and improve mood, and the drugs gabapentin (an anti-epilepsy drug) and clonidine may also ease the episodes. Perhaps now is the time for an appointment with your GP to discuss your concerns and treatment options. I was diagnosed years ago with a slow heart rate, but have recently found that I feel very tired in the mornings — it takes me around an hour or so to get going. Is my heart condition to blame for my dreadful fatigue? Alan Cockayne, by email. You are describing, I believe, a condition called sick sinus syndrome or sinus node dysfunction. The sinus node is the natural pacemaker of the heart: it sets the rate. You have not stated how old you are, but ageing of the cells of that area of the heart muscle may result in this timer becoming unreliable (this condition is more common in the over-70s), and the heart rate can become slower. The condition, which is fairly uncommon, results in not enough blood being pumped around the body, triggering symptoms of light-headedness, breathlessness, fatigue or palpitations. In your case, these episodes seem to particularly strike at night, which is why you are feeling so tired in the morning. Diagnosis involves a 24-hour or even a seven-day ECG (an electrocardiogram, which measures the electrical activity of the heart). It’s also important to look for any easily treatable causes — for instance, certain medications can affect heart rhythm. You tell me in your longer letter that you are taking a small dose of amlodipine for high blood pressure. This is one of a group of medicines called calcium channel-blockers, which may affect heart rate and, therefore, be exacerbating your symptoms. (There are alternative medications for your blood pressure that won’t adversely affect the sinus node and it’s important to discuss this point with your GP.) One option for a slow heart rate is to have a pacemaker implanted. While this helps reverse any fainting or light-headedness in most patients — important for preventing falls — it may not have such a beneficial effect when the main symptom is fatigue, as in your case. And as there are potential complications from such surgery, including infection or bleeding, the decision to have a pacemaker fitted is more complicated and involves carefully weighing up the risks and benefits. Once the sinus node starts to deteriorate, it tends to continue doing so. For that reason I believe you should be having periodic reviews by a cardiologist — and every time you are seen, the correlation between your symptoms and  the ECG recordings should  be re-evaluated. Fork off: Modern westerners eat too much meat . When my children went to school, the . headmaster insisted they had swimming lessons from the first day. ‘No . one ever died from not learning French,’ he would say. But there was . another important message schools could have been passing on: the . importance of healthy living, or rather, healthy eating. However, this just wasn’t given any thought in those days. The . decades have passed and I am now a grandparent and I think about this a . lot. My patients, as a group, have aged with me, and many are suffering . the ravages of coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and . stroke. And I find myself constantly wishing that 30 years ago I’d been . as enlightened about healthy eating as I am now. Medical . men like me spend a lot of time seeking out the nooks and crannies of . science to see what can be applied to the quest for the better health of . our patients, as well as those close to us. But sometimes the answer is . closer to home — in the kitchen. I recently attended a fascinating . evening at Kew Gardens in London to learn more about the health benefits . of eating less meat. They . were not advocating ditching meat altogether — this was not a push . towards vegetarianism — but a careful, balanced look at why it can be a . good thing to eat less meat and more plant-based foods. Since . the days when I was at school the world population has doubled, and now . 70  per cent of land throughout the world is given over to agricultural . use to grow crops to feed animals. The result is we are over-eating the . foods — meat and dairy products — that are least good for our health . and  the environment. In my . childhood, the biggest treat at the end of the school holidays was to . have chicken for dinner: it was special and we called it ‘The Last . Supper’. Yet, thanks to mass production, by the time I was at university . even we impoverished medical students bought chicken by the bucketload. The . experts at Kew argued there could be much benefit to be gained from . tweaking the balance of what we eat, little by little, to ensure that at . least two-thirds of the food at each meal comes from plants — . wholegrain carbohydrates, nuts, beans, lentils, fruit, vegetables and . plant-based alternatives to dairy foods, including soya. Meat, . fish, eggs, and dairy foods can be a third — or less — but of better . quality. In this way we reduce the intake of bad types of fat, have a . lower incidence of heart disease, diabetes and even cancer, and place . less burden on the resources of the world. But . how can we achieve this change? It has to begin with education, and . this means teaching human biology and nutrition, instructing children . about food, the relationship to future health and how to develop good . eating habits. Let’s do it.",Dr Martin Scurr gives advice on herbal help for menopause .

Leaders in a small North Dakota town have approved a bill that prevents any new construction to take place in a move to prevent an neo-Nazi from building a 'white-only' community. Craig Cobb has bought a home and 12 other lots in Leith and is encouraging others who want to build an Aryan enclave with him to move there and help him take control of the community. The white supremacist says the new law unfairly targets him. Craig Cobb address supporters inside the Leith Town Hall. Cobb a white supremacist, originally from Canada, has purchased many lots in the tiny town . The Bismarck Tribune reports that city . officials are working on an ordinance that will require Cobb to install . water and sewer service in his house, where three other male white . supremacists and two children also are living. Another . ordinance would prevent tents and campers from being on a city lot for . more than 10 consecutive days. Cobb calls the proposals 'patently . unfair'. The new ordinances will require Cobb to put water and sewer into his house, where three other white male supremacists and two young children are also living with space heaters and no working furnace. Under the ordinance, anyone without water and sewer will have 30 days to come into compliance, or face fines or possible condemnation. The city also approved a moratorium that prevents any new building until planning and zoning is put into place. Defiant: Bobby Harper, the only black resident of Leith, North Dakota, says he isn't leaving - even though white supremacists are moving into his tiny town. He is pictured here with his wife, Sherrill . Supremacist's paradise: Craig Cobb, 61, has invited dozens of neo-Nazi leaders to Leith to start to haven for racist hate groups . Craig Cobb, a self-described white supremacist, had already bought several homes and properties in Leith when he moved to the town 75 miles southwest of Bismark last year. He had bought at least a dozen properties and given several of them to leaders of major neo-Nazi hate groups. Often, he paid just hundreds or a few thousand dollars absentee owners who had long ago fled Leith and left their properties in disrepair. He has grand visions for the town and is determined to revitalize it. He told National Public Radio: 'It would be extraordinarily beautiful when people enter the town, particularly at night because we will have floodlit flags from both the bottom and the top of all the formerly white nations of the earth. 'We will probably have the National Socialist hunting flag with stag horns and a very small swastika in the center, very discreet.' Ramshackle: Leith has just 24 residents. It has been in a slow decline for decades. Cobb bought most of the properties for just hundreds or a few thousand dollars . He plans parks and monuments and a municipal swimming pool, all named after white-power activists. But the Cobb and his white supremacist ilk have one immediate obstacle to their all-white paradise in Leith: Bobby Harper, the town's only black resident. 'I'm not leaving,' Harper told NPR. 'They gotta do something very, very drastic to me to make it unsafe and uncomfortable for me. Right now, I don't see it happening.' The U.S. National Socialist Movement, America's largest white  supremacist group, is joining forces with Cobb and is calling its members to Leith for a meeting on Sunday and Monday. 'We have every intention of legally assuming control of the local government,' Socialist Movement leader Jeff Schoep said in a statement. Cobb moved to Leith from Montana and has purchased about a dozen homes and vacant parcels of land . According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Cobb wants to set up a 'Pioneer Little Europe.' In . an interview with WXMB-TV in Bismarck, Cobb said he had gotten a lot of . offers to buy up land from what he termed like-minded people who . believe white people should not be punished for wanting to live near . each other. 'It's fine for all these other minorities, but not us,' he said in the televised interview. 'If you merely speak about it, you're going to be defamed in this country.' Cobb was arrested in 2010 in Canada on federal charges of willful promotion of hatred. He was living in Montana under dual citizenship until his arrival in Grant County. He began to buy properties from absentee owners for a few hundred dollars each. When county court employees asked Cobb why he was buying so many, incredibly Cobb said he was aiming to rename the town 'Cobbsville', according to Tax Director Muriel Ulrich.","Leaders in a small North Dakota town have approved a moratorium on any new construction .

All babies and young children should be given free vitamins on the NHS to combat rising cases of bone disease, according to England’s chief medical officer. Renewed fears about rickets caused by lack of vitamin D have prompted Professor Dame Sally Davies to call for a review of current policy, which distributes free vitamins only to low-income families. Rickets, a scourge of Victorian Britain, was virtually eradicated after the Second World War but is returning in children due partly to lack of outdoor play and to poor diets low in vitamin D-rich foods such as oily fish, eggs and liver. Professor Dame Sally Davies said all babies and young children should be given free vitamins on the NHS . During the war children were given food supplements such as cod liver oil, but this practice stopped in the 1950s. In a report, Professor Davies also warns children’s health in the UK is slipping behind other major European countries. A spoonful of cod liver oil used to be a daily routine for millions of children. The practice began during the Second World War amid concerns that rationing might deprive children of vital nutrients. The strong-tasting oil comes from the liver of cod fish, and because of its high levels of vitamins A and D it was intended to prevent diseases such as rickets. Its high content of omega-3 fatty acids – which some research suggests boost brain power in children – may have been a beneficial side effect. Other studies show it works as an anti-inflammatory for adults with rheumatoid arthritis and may help alleviate joint stiffness in osteoarthritis. Modern cod liver oil has a higher vitamin A content compared with decades ago. Five extra children die a day from potentially avoidable causes in the UK compared with Sweden, mostly during the first year of life, she said. Giving vitamins could help reverse the trend, she claims. ‘We know that many children, not just those in vulnerable groups, have vitamin deficiency,’ she added. She has asked the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) to examine whether it would be cost-effective for all children to receive daily drops or tablets containing vitamins A, C and D. The NHS already recommends all youngsters . aged six months to five years take the vitamins, but parents must pay . for them unless they are part of the NHS’s means-tested Healthy Start . scheme. Professor Davies said the UK’s record on children’s health used to be ‘one of the best but we are now the worst’. Possible causes include lifestyle behaviours in pregnancy such as smoking, and poor care in infancy. Rickets is on the rise due partly to a lack of outdoor play and poor diets low in vitamin D-rich foods . She singled out rickets, saying it was making a comeback, with about 800 cases a year. ‘It’s appalling,’ Professor Davies said. An estimated 40 per cent of children are estimated to have vitamin D levels below the recommended amount. The vitamin helps the body absorb calcium, essential for healthy bones and teeth. Meanwhile vitamin A strengthens children’s immune systems and eyesight and maintains healthy skin. Vitamin C is important for general health and helps the body absorb iron. ‘We are offering these vitamins to vulnerable children and the take-up is low, but many children not in these communities need them too,’ Professor Davies said. She said a scheme in Birmingham to offer vitamin D supplements to all children means one in five now take them – halving the number of cases of rickets and other deficiency problems. There is evidence lack of  vitamin D might contribute to longer term health problems involving the immune system, she said. Claire Lemer, editor of the report, said: ‘We do  know from studies that making vitamins available to all can  lead to a boost in families taking up the offer.’ Other recommendations include assigning a named GP to every child with long-term conditions and a regular survey on children’s mental health. The report also says reducing obesity by one percentage point in children could save the NHS £1billion a year. Professor Davies said 12.5 per cent of toddlers are obese, as are 17 per cent of boys and 16 per cent of girls aged up to 15, adding that the ‘long-term consequences are massive’. Rickets, or soft and deformed bones, was first noted by physicians in ancient Rome but was not linked with lack of vitamin D until the start of the 20th century. It was common in Victorian times because of lack of access to sunlight – which the body needs to make vitamin D – and poor diets. It mostly disappeared in the West during the 1940s thanks to the fortification of foods such as margarine, and children were also routinely given cod liver oil. Rickets is still a major problem in third-world countries. However, UK cases have been rising in the past 15 years, from 183 in 1996 to 762 in 2011. Experts believe this is partly because children are eating less fish and eggs than in the past. They also blame extensive use of sunscreen, and children spending more time indoors.","Professor Dame Sally Davies has called for a review of current policy .

The injuries to the boy were only revealed three days after the incident when his parents realised he had trouble walking and took him to hospital. An investigation was launched after emergency staff at Layola University Medical Centre suspected the burns to be a result of child abuse. Prosecutors said Santos was cooking when his son came into the kitchen and said his nappy needed changing. Santos pulled the nappy off, but it fell apart in his hands which prosecutors said made him even angrier.

A child was drugged with a heroin substitute intended for an addict after a Boots pharmacist handed out the wrong medicine to her mother . A child was drugged with a heroin substitute intended for an addict after a Boots pharmacist gave her mother the wrong medicine. Incredibly, the mix up appears to have taken place because staff at London branch said the girl’s mother looked like the addict, and so got the medications confused. The girl, who should have been prescribed an antibiotic, had six doses of the addict’s methadone before the mistake was uncovered and she was taken to hospital for treatment. Details of the mistake were revealed in information released by the NHS under Freedom of Information laws. The mix-up took place when the child’s mother went into the 24 hour branch of Boots to collect a repeat prescription of Flucloxacillin, an antibiotic commonly used to treat children’s chest infections. But staff at the chemist appeared to mistake the mother for an addict who regularly picked up her methadone prescription from the same branch. Instead of giving the mother the antibiotic, staff at the branch handed over the powerful heroin substitute, which has strict guidelines about how it should be dispensed. Later the same day, the addict arrived at the Boots branch to collect her methadone but a different pharmacist refused to hand it over, saying their records showed it had already been given out. The report says that the mother then gave her daughter 5ml doses of methadone believing the medicine was the antibiotic her daughter had previously been prescribed. By the time the blunder was uncovered the child had taken 30g of methadone in a total of six 5ml doses. She was taken to hospital where medical staff cared for her while the effects of the drug wore off. The blunder in 2011 sparked a ‘Serious Incident’ report which was sent to NHS London. A summary says: ‘The pharmacist and the pharmacy should have followed the Boots standard operating procedures for dispensing medication. This involves checking that the right person receives the prescribed medication.’ The mix up appears to have taken place because staff at the branch in London said the girl's mother looked like the addict, and so got the medications confused . A spokesman for the company said: ‘At Boots UK everything we do, every day, is about how we care for our customers and patient safety is at the heart of our business. 'Our pharmacists adhere to the strict guidelines around issuing methadone. 'We conducted a full and thorough review of our practices at the time of this incident in 2011.’ Methadone is a synthetic opiate that is manufactured for use as a painkiller and as a substitute for heroine. It has similar effects to heroin but does not deliver the same high. Opiates are sedative drugs that depress the nervous system - they slow down body functioning and reduce physical and psychological pain. If a person takes too much methadone it can cause drowsiness, confusion, a weak pulse, weak breathing and fainting. In extreme cases, it can be fatal.","Pharmacist at London Boots mistook child's mother for a heroin addict and gave her methadone prescription instead of daughter's antibiotics .

Some senior members of the Royal Family have not been invited to Prince George’s christening this month because his parents want it to be an ‘intimate, family affair’, the Daily Mail has learnt. Prince William’s aunts, Princess Anne and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, have been left off the guest list, the Mail was told last night. And although Buckingham Palace refused to comment, it seems George’s great-uncles, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, are also not attending the hugely anticipated event on October 23. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge want the Christening of their son Prince George to be an 'intimate, family affair' William and Kate have already chosen to break with recent royal tradition and have their son christened at the Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace, because it is smaller and ‘more personal’ than Buckingham Palace. Now the Mail has learnt that only the couple’s closest family and friends will be attending. The full guest list will not be confirmed by Kensington Palace until nearer the day, but it is likely to include great-grandparents the Queen and Prince Philip, and grandparents Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, as well as uncle Prince Harry. Kate’s parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, sister Pippa and brother James are also due to attend. Details . of the six chosen godparents are also yet to be released, but names in . the frame include William’s longest-serving adviser Jamie . Lowther-Pinkerton, best friend Thomas van Straubenzee and ex-royal nanny . Tiggy Legge-Bourke. Not invited: Royal Sophie, Countess of Wessex (left) and Princess Anne (right) will not attend the Christening . Instead of joining the celebrations, the Countess of Wessex, who is married to Prince Edward, will now undertake a day of engagements in the West Country, while Princess Anne is going ahead with an official visit to Canada. When asked whether either had been invited in the first place, a palace source said: ‘All I can say is that the christening will be an intimate affair.’ Kensington Palace refused to comment last night, saying: ‘We will announce the full guest list in due course when we are ready to do so.’ But a royal source added: ‘The christening will be a small, intimate and personal family affair.’ The couple’s decision to use the Chapel Royal as a venue surprised many when it as announced earlier this month. Prince William, Prince Charles, Prince Andrew and Princess Anne were all baptised in the Music Room at Buckingham Palace. Location: William and Kate have already chosen to break with recent royal tradition and have their son christened at the Chapel Royal in St James's Palace (pictured) The Queen was christened in the palace’s private chapel. But the Duke and Duchess have long made clear they aren’t sticklers for royal convention. William ripped up the suggested guest list for his wedding because he ‘hardly knew anyone on it’ and the couple decided to release a family snapshot of Prince George taken by Kate’s father Michael instead of a formal portrait following his birth on July 22. A one kilo special gold coin minted to celebrate the christening . It is understood that William and Kate favoured the Holbein-decorated Chapel Royal because it is, in the words of one royal aide, ‘a small, very personal venue’. The couple have a deep emotional attachment to St James’s Palace, where, until recently, their household was based. In 1997, the body of William’s mother Diana, Princess of Wales lay before the chapel altar so her family and friends could pay their respects in private, before her funeral in Westminster Abbey. And in April 2011, Kate chose the chapel to be confirmed into the Church of England before her marriage to Prince William. A Palace source last night confirmed it would be a ‘fairly small and intimate affair’. By contrast William’s christening in August 1982 was attended by more than 60 guests. Prince Andrew, who was serving in the Falklands War, and Princess Margaret, who was holidaying in Italy, were the only senior royals not in attendance.","Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, are also understood not to be attending .

The cherubic face and angelic smile might suggest a sweet disposition. But Logan Steed’s school record indicates otherwise – he was suspended four times in his first year before finally being expelled. The five-year-old has bitten and punched other children and staff, thrown school equipment and  stolen fruit. On one occasion his entire class was evacuated to protect other pupils. The last straw came when he kicked a teacher in the face as she bent over his chair. But his parents claim he is well-behaved at home and say he has been ‘thrown on the scrapheap’ by the school. ‘They said they had to exclude him to ensure the safety of the staff and pupils but I don’t understand how a five-year-old can pose so much of  a threat,’ said his father, Cameron, 27, a care home manager. Logan’s uncontrollable behaviour was noted on his first day as a four-year-old at Powers Hall Infant School in Witham, Essex, in September last year. He was soon put on a report system under which he was monitored daily and information emailed by his head teacher to his parents, who are separated. He had been ‘kicking, biting, pinching and punching adults’, said a report on November 20 last year. Damaging effects: Logan's family believe Powers Hall Infant School has 'thrown him on the scrap heap' and that the expulsion will affect him for the rest of his life . 'Threat': Headteacher Claire Edwards said in her . report that she was forced to exclude the boy because of the risk to . the safety of other children and staff . It also detailed the incident a week earlier that led to his expulsion. ‘He was sitting and the member of . staff was holding his arms. He kicked his legs straight into the member . of staff’s face,’ the report said. ‘She let go of his arms and he ran off into the library.’ Angel-faced: Logan Steed's parents Laura, 22, and Cameron, 27, say he is always well behaved at home . Kicked out: Logan, pictured aged three, was suspended four times in his first year after being accused of violence and causing chaos by throwing food around . It was not clear yesterday why the . teacher had been holding Logan, who has been tested for several . conditions including Asperger’s syndrome and abnormalities to do with . his diet and health. All came back negative. The school tried to manage his . behaviour with action plans including one-to-one support from the head . teacher and allowing him to do his activities in any order. Isolated: Logan, who splits his week between his parents' homes, now receives just an hour of tuition a week . His mother, Laura, 22, a chef from Braintree, Essex, said: ‘Before Logan started school we didn’t know he had this side to him. 'It is like we are talking about two . completely different boys. At home he does exactly what he is told and . we have never seen him do any of the things the school say he did. 'He really is a clever boy and now that is being wasted.’ 'Dangerous': Logan, pictured with mother Laura, was taken out of the care of one teacher with whom he got on after she became pregnant . Mr and Mrs Steed believe their son should be at a mainstream school where he can socialise with other children. They have a right to appeal against his expulsion but decided not to because of the possible reaction if he was reinstated. At present, Logan receives an hour of tuition a day at a specialist school. Head teacher Claire Edwards said her staff and pupils ‘deserve to work and learn in a safe place’. She added: ‘The decision to permanently exclude a child is never taken lightly and one I take with great sadness. ‘This school takes a firm stance on the safety of pupils and staff and assaults on either cannot and will not be tolerated.’","Logan Steed is a 'happy and polite' child at home, say mother and father .

"By . Helen Collis . PUBLISHED: . 11:08 EST, 23 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:41 EST, 23 August 2013 . European imports of khat - a plant chewed as a stimulant - have rocketed recently with border officials seizing 1.3 tonnes of it in Geneva alone this year. Swiss customs staff have documented the vast hauls at Geneva airport over the last two years and show that, despite being made illegal, smugglers often made no attempt to hide the plants. Whole suitcases have been neatly ram packed full of bundles of the plant and nothing else. The amount of khat seized by Geneva customs officials has soared nearly ten-fold in two years, from 168.6kg in 2011, to 623.5kg in 2012, and to date this year, 1.3 tonnes. Neatly packed: Khat traffickers coming through Geneva airport have made little attempt to hide their gear packing it in bags right up to the brim . Khat (Catha edulis) is a plant from Africa which is chewed as a stimulant, provoking a feeling of euphoria. It is popular in a number of countries, particularly in the Horn of Africa, and its use in Europe appears to have grown substantially in the last few years. It has been banned in the US and most EU states, including Switzerland, with British Home Secretary Theresa May announcing last month she would enforce a UK ban on khat, effectively classifying it as a Class C drug. According to GenevaLunch.com, relatively . small amounts of the drug were in the past found mainly in traffickers . using the forests and back roads around Geneva to cross the border. The natural stimulant has been banned in Switzerland and other EU countries; it is soon to be listed as a class C drug in the UK . The smallest amount they had seized was 1.48kg being brought into the country by a Swiss resident, but now the largest haul recorded is 95kg. The find was picked up in the freight area of the airport where it was heading for the United States, the news service said. The traffickers in Switzerland tend to be Somalis who live in the UK although more recently, customs officials have reported a trend in traffickers from Hungary, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, according to the local news service. The natural stimulant tends to be sold by the 'box' costing between £14 and £21 for around 200 grams. After the euphoric feeling subsides, it is said to be followed by a low, and subsequent passivity. The plant, which contains cathinone an amphetamine-like substance, is often harvested and flown in from the Horn of Africa . Among communities in Ethopia, Somalia and the Yemen, chewing the flowering plant has a long history as a social custom dating back thousands of years. But the leaves contain cathinone, an amphetamine-like stimulant that can be  addictive. It has a molecular structure similar to that of amphetamines. Consumed in excess, it is said to provoke hallucinations and psychological problems, although in 1980 the World Health Organization classified it as a drug of abuse that can produce 'mild to moderate psychological dependence' (less than tobacco or alcohol). In the UK, Mrs May has pushed for its ban, despite advice against the move by an official advisory body. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) in the UK reports that more than 2,500 tonnes, worth about £13.8m, was imported to the UK in 2011/12, bringing in £2.8m of tax revenues. Khat 'houses' in Britain have been linked to terrorism, with police targeting those in Woolwich, London, amid fears they are recruiting grounds for Islamic extremists. Mrs May's proposed ban means khat will be treated as a class C drug, like anabolic steroids and ketamine. Trade: Somali families monopolise the export of khat to Europe in Kenya. They create links with Somalis in UK and send initial supplies based on trust . Workers: Kenyan labourers pack bunches of khat into banana leaves so they can be shipped to the UK . Labour: The export business is owned by Somali families who use Kenyan workers as they are cheaper .","Geneva airport officials seen nearly ten-fold rise in khat imports since 2011 .

Kidnapped: Ali Zeidan is pictured after being captured by a militia group in Tripoli today . Libyan prime minister Ali Zeidan today said that he is 'fine' after being freed by militants who kidnapped him from a hotel in Tripoli and demanded that he resign. The kidnapping was carried out by a militia this morning in revenge for the government's role in the capture of a top Al Qaeda suspect by U.S. troops. But Mr Zeidan was released six hours after he and two of his guards were snatched from the Corinthia Hotel, where he lives, and returned to government headquarters. After regaining his freedom, the prime minister told his cabinet: 'We hope this matter will be treated with wisdom and rationality, far from tension,' he said. 'There are many things that need dealing with.' He later appealed for calm in a television broadcast, saying: 'I hope this problem will be resolved with reason and wisdom' and without any 'escalation'. Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague expressed relief at the news, tweeting: 'I welcome release of Libyan PM. We will work with Libyan gov on ensuring the transition remains on track and insecurity is addressed.' A spokesman for the Operations Room of Libya's Revolutionaries, a group of former rebels, claimed responsibility for Mr Zeidan's adbuction and blamed the U.S. operation which captured suspected terrorist Abu Anas al-Liby. 'His arrest comes after... John Kerry said the Libyan government was aware of the operation,' the spokesman said. Scroll down for video . Healthy: Mr Zeidan appeared unharmed when he addressed a press conference after his release . Setback: The kidnapping is the latest victory for the militias who control much of Libya's fragile security . As many as 150 gunmen were seen driving up to the hotel in pick-up trucks, with some laying siege to the building and others going to Mr Zeidan's suite on the 21st floor. The prime minister did not resist when he was led away around 5.15am, according to witnesses, who reported that no shots had been fired. Corinthia's security manager said . that the gunmen had brandished an arrest warrant for Mr Zeidan from the . public prosecutor, although the official's office said that no such . document had been issued. The two guards who were kidnapped with the prime minister were beaten by their captors, but later released. Free: Mr Zeidan, wearing a suit and tie, was mobbed by crowds as he returned to government headquarters this afternoon following his capture . Scene: Mr Zeidan was snatched from Tripoli's Corinthia Hotel, pictured, where he lives . A government official said the prime . minister was being held at the Interior Ministry's anti-crime department, . and was 'in good health and being treated well'. Mr Zeidan's release came after members of a rival militia stormed the building where he was being held and opened fire on his captors. The two sides exchanged gunshots, but the prime minister was not hurt before being freed, according to a leader of the militia which kidnapped him. Global leaders were quick to speak . out against Mr Zeidan's kidnap - Mr Hague said: 'I condemn the abduction of Libya's Prime Minister and call . for his immediate release. 'Our . ambassador is in touch with other members of the interim government. It . is vital that the process of political transition in Libya is . maintained. 'The government and people of Libya have our full support at this concerning time.' Revenge: Mr Zeidan, pictured addressing the UN last month, was apparently taken by militants angry with his role in a U.S. Special Forces Operation last weekend . Leader: Mr Zeidan pictured with David Cameron during a meeting in 10 Downing St in September this year . Ali Zeidan, 62, was one of the most prominent Libyan dissidents during the rule of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. He started his career as a diplomat under the Gaddafi regime, serving in India during the 1970s, but in 1980 he defected and fled to Switzerland. Along with former ambassador Mohammed Magariaf, Mr Zeidan helped lead the National Front for the Salvation of Libya for 30 years. When the uprising against Gaddafi's rule began in 2011, he took a leading role in the National Transitional Council, the umbrella group for exiled dissidents. Mr Zeidan was the council's envoy to European governments, and is believed to have been crucial in the effort to persuade French president Nicolas Sarkozy to support air strikes against Gaddafi's forces. Following the fall of Gaddafi in October 2011, he was elected as an opposition congressman, and last year became prime minister with the support of groups opposed to the Muslim Brotherhood. Mr Zeidan is considered relatively liberal, although he has previously pledged that Libya should be 'a state based on Islam'. Two . years after a revolution toppled dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Libya's central . government has been struggling to contain rival tribal militias and . Islamist militants who control parts of the country. On Tuesday, Mr Zeidan called for the West to help stop militancy in his country. The Operations Room of Libya's Revolutionaries was one of many armed groups involved in the toppling of Colonel Gaddafi in 2011. The militia has since been hired by the Interior Ministry to provide security in Tripoli. Mr Zeidan's spokesman initially denied that he had been kidnapped and dismissed the news as 'rumours'. But he later confirmed the news and claimed that he was coerced by the kidnappers into denying the reports. A . statement on the Libyan Government's website read: 'The head of the . transitional government, Ali Zeidan, was taken to an unknown destination . for unknown reasons by a group.' Al-Arbiya . television has shown what it claims are stills of Mr Zeidan, a former . human rights lawyer, frowning with a group of men in civilian clothes . around him. The Corinthia Hotel where Mr Zeidan was taken is home to a number of diplomats and government officials, and is usually considered to be one of the safest locations in Tripoli. Following the . abduction, the Libyan cabinet met for an emergency session chaired by . the deputy prime minister, Abdel-Salam al-Qadi. Islamist militant groups were angered last weekend when al-Liby was snatched off the street by U.S Navy Seals in Tripoli. He was seized in an early morning raid on Saturday over the bombing of U.S embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998. Statesman: Mr Zeidan was a prominent dissident before returning to Libya after the fall of Colonel Gaddafi . Taken: Mr Zeidan, left, who is pictured shaking hands with the Tunisian Prime Minister was led from the hotel in what has been described by guards as an 'arrest' Target: Abu Anas al-Liby was captured by U.S. Navy Seals on the streets of Tripoli last Saturday . Extremists took to Facebook to urge . fellow Libyans to target ships and planes as well as taking U.S. citizens hostage in order to exchange them for imprisoned jihadists. Several groups accused the Libyan Government of colluding with the U.S over the arrest, but officials denied any prior knowledge of the operation. Mr Zeidan's kidnap comes just hours after he met with members of al-Liby's family on Wednesday. According to reports, dozens of unarmed Libyan soldiers occupied Mr Zeidan's office on Monday demanding unpaid wages. Mr Zeidan was appointed Prime Minister by the General National Congress in Libya in October last year and took office the following month. He had previously served as a human rights lawyer in Geneva. Mr Zeidan started his career as a Libyan diplomat in India. But he was exiled from the country for three decades after defecting and forming the National Front for the Salvation of Libya in 1980. During the overthrow of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 he served as the European envoy for Libya's National Transitional Council, and is said to have been instrumental in persuading France's then-president Nicolas Sarkozy to back anti-Gaddafi rebels. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki, travelling with Secretary of State John Kerry in Brunei, said: 'We are looking into these reports and we are in close touch with senior U.S. and Libyan officials on the ground.'","Ali Zeidan was abducted from the Corinthia Hotel in Tripoli by militia gang .

Mr Carney’s sunny introduction to the English way of life came on the day before formally beginning his new job today. He was poached by Chancellor George Osborne from the Bank of Canada, and he now begins the task of helping rebuild Britain’s battered economy. Mr Osborne’s deputy, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, was also on the cricket pitch yesterday. Governor’s Day, a sports day for employees of the Bank and their families, was a chance for Mr Carney, 48, to meet his new colleagues informally and have some fun before the serious work begins. As well as enjoying bouncy castles and fairground rides, invite-only guests could play tennis, football and cricket. Sir Mervyn, 65, whose final day in the job was yesterday, wore cricket whites and enthusiastically played tennis and cricket in the 26C sunshine.

Getting to know you: Mr Carney speaks (left) with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, and (right) giving an interview to a television crew . Despite being an avid sportsman, Mr Carney, wearing a blue blazer and matching trousers, chose not to take part in the games, instead watching others play before retiring to a pavilion tent. He was a hockey star in his youth, and recently discovered his old pair of football boots from his days at Oxford University - still caked in Oxford mud, according to a friend. In Canada, Mr Carney was hailed as a ‘rock star banker’ for his genius in keeping the economy growing during the global economic crisis. He arrives in London - as the first non-British Governor of the Bank of England - with pressure on him to work his magic to revive the economy here. He has already signalled a possible end to the record period of low interest rates and the cheap mortgages they bring.

Well-liked: Mr Carney (right) was hailed in Canada as a 'rock star banker' for his genius in keeping the economy growing during the global economic crisis . In addition, he will also earn £1,000 a week renting out his luxury family house in Ottawa, Canada, for the five years he will be Bank of England Governor. His wife Diana and their four school-age daughters have gone on a holiday before moving to Britain to join him, as their London lodgings are not yet available. Earlier this year, Mrs Carney suggested on Twitter that her family had been struggling to find a place live in London, bemoaning that an influx of wealthy French fleeing their socialist president’s hefty taxes had made their house-hunting in London more difficult. Friends in Canada say the children are apprehensive about uprooting their lives and moving to Britain. But both of their parents are looking forward to the move.

The actor has filed a lawsuit. In a statement, Macy's said there was no record of any employee contacting authorities about Mr Brown's purchase. The store said police officers requested use of a room in the building and that request was granted.

Mr Brown's account comes after claims from two black shoppers said they were racially profiled at Barneys New York. Trayon Christian sued Barneys, saying he was accused of fraud after using his debit card to buy a $349 Ferragamo belt in April. Kayla Philips filed a notice of claim saying she would sue after she was stopped by detectives outside the store when she bought a $2,500 Celine handbag in February. As the criticism grew, Barneys said it had retained a civil rights expert to help review its procedures. The CEO of Barneys, Mark Lee, offered his 'sincere regret and deepest apologies.' Kirsten John Foy, an official with the Rev.

The parents of overweight and obese children should be told to cut back the amount of ‘screen-time’ their children have. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has released new guidelines for health workers which say parents should be encouraged to find ways to make their children less sedentary in their daily life. For example, overweight children should be encouraged . to keep a record of how long they spend in front of a television or . computer every day as a way of monitoring their activity levels. The guidelines also state that NICE suggests health workers should ask parents to consider whether their children could walk to school. Professor Mike Kelly, director of the Centre for Public Health at NICE, said ‘We are recommending family-based lifestyle programmes are provided which give tailored advice. ‘These programmes will also support parents to identify changes that can be done at home to tackle obesity - and maintained over the long-term. ‘Many of them are things we should all be doing anyway, including healthy eating, getting the whole family to be more active and reducing the amount of time spent watching TV and playing computer games.’ He added: ‘Being overweight or obese has a significant impact on a child’s quality of life. ‘It can affect their self-esteem and they are more likely to be bullied or stigmatised. Local commissioners - including local authorities - need to make sure that the right services are available when families need them. ‘They also need to be convenient and easy to access - so parents and their children can stick with them.’ NICE says parents in ‘denial’ about their children being obese should also be identified to prevent them becoming a barrier to weight loss. The watchdog claims parents may undermine efforts to get fat children and teenagers to face up to the problem. ‘Efforts to manage a child or young person’s weight are not always supported, and are sometimes undermined, by members of the wider family,’ it said.’ The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has released new guidelines for health workers which say parents should be encouraged to find ways to make their children less sedentary in their daily life . ‘This is possibly because of a lack of . understanding of the aims of lifestyle weight management programmes and . the importance of managing the weight of obese or overweight children . and young people. It added that a ‘lack of recognition, or denial’ can prevent them from joining, and adhering to, a weight management course. These programmes can include Weight Watchers, which Nice has already approved as a way for GPs to assist patients in losing weight. In 2011 in England, around 30 per cent of boys and girls aged two to 15 were either overweight or obese.

A 10-year-old girl who made it her mission to raise awareness of childhood cancer after being diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor last year has died. Gabriella Miller, who raised $275,000 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation and even published a children's book about cancer, passed away at her home in Leesburg, Virginia on Sunday morning. 'It is with the heaviest of hearts and . the greatest of love that we share the news that our daughter Gabriella . passed away last night,' her parents, Mark and Ellyn Miller, said in a statement on their Facebook page. 'Thank you for loving our . daughter and for all of your support.' The little girl, who was diagnosed with brain cancer just before Thanksgiving last year, had began hospice care at home last week after a decline in her health and was unable to move or speak. Inspiration: Gabriella Miller, who raised $275,000 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation and began her own charity, has passed away. She was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor last year . 'Gabriella was also angry . that she was dying,' her mother wrote on Facebook. 'This was not fair & not ok. She had plans & . goals for herself that she knew would never be realized.' But she added: 'When I think . about the last five days of Gabriella's life, I am astounded once again by my girl. Cancer . took her over, took away her ability to walk, talk & move - with the . exception of her right arm, with which she communicated with us by . signing - but G still had all her mental faculties.' The family has donated her . tumor to research and they will now live out Gabriella's final wishes . for them - such as visits to Disney World and using the word 'soda' instead of 'pop', they said. Gabriella . had launched a letter-writing campaign last year that helped raise more . than $275,000 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, after the charity helped . realize her dream of going to Paris. Accomplished: Gabriella, pictured left before her diagnosis, co-wrote a book, 'Beamer Learns About Cancer' with the author of the Beamer series, Cindy Chambers (pictured together right) Determined to help other children . have their last wishes granted as well, she wanted to spread her motto: . 'You might have a bad day today but there's always a bright star to look . forward to tomorrow. What's your bright star?' The . family found out that the Foundation would receive a $1 million . donation from Macy's if the company got a million letters for Santa . Claus before Christmas. The . Millers started a campaign called 'Make A Wish with Gabriella' and . launched a Facebook page - and watched as tens of thousands of letters . began to arrive from all across the world, smashing her goal of getting . 10,000 letters to Macy's. Gabriella . delivered almost 241,000 letters to her local Macy's store before . Christmas. In total, letters taken in by her or sent on her behalf . reached more than 250,000. Devoted: She made headlines last Christmas after launching a letter-writing campaign so Macy's would donate to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. More than 250,000 people sent letters (pictured) Her efforts resulted in enough funding to pay for 36 more wishes to be granted to other children. After the success of the campaign, she realized she wanted to step up her commitment to the cause. Earlier this year, the family launched the Smashing Walnuts Foundation; doctors had initially told Gabriella her tumor was the size of a walnut so she and her family smashed walnuts with pans as a symbol of her fighting the cancer. 'I want to smash that walnut,' she told NBC4. 'That's the point of my foundation. Smashing out childhood brain cancer. I'm gonna keep fighting, I'm gonna keep smashing these walnuts 'til they're gone.' Gabriella also became a published author after contributing to 'Beamer Learns About Cancer', a book featuring the popular character that aims to teach children about the illness. Loved: Gabriella, with her parents and brother, later set up her own foundation and continued to speak out about childhood cancer. She was surrounded by her family when she passed away on Sunday . 'I never thought I'd publish a book about . cancer,' she said. 'It was a dream come true to become an author. I just love . writing more than anything in the world.' She was also granted her wish of attending college by going to Shenandoah University, which gave her an honorary degree after she took a full day of classes earlier this year. As she celebrated, she told NBC4: 'I'm at a Selena Gomez concert and she's one of my favorite singers and tomorrow I'm graduating college so I'm feeling pretty good.' A public memorial service for Gabriella is being held on Wednesday at 6.30pm at Heritage High School in Leesburg.

Target: Joss Stone leaves Exeter Crown Court after giving evidence against the pair who plotted to kill her . Two men were convicted yesterday of plotting to decapitate Joss Stone with a samurai sword. The singer was the target of a shockingly violent scheme by Kevin Liverpool and Junior Bradshaw, who labelled her a ‘she-devil’ and wanted to kill her because of her links to the Royal Family. The pair, described as ‘cannabis-smoking layabouts’, were stopped as they drove to the pop star’s home in Devon with a car full of weapons. Miss Stone, 25, who had given evidence at their trial, said she was glad they would now be prevented from ‘causing harm to anyone’. Liverpool and Bradshaw’s plan was described in court as a ‘crazy scheme’ hatched by ‘deluded incompetents’ who crashed their car, lost their way, and asked for directions while waving a picture of the singer. A judge jailed 35-year-old Liverpool for life yesterday, with a minimum term of ten years and eight months. Bradshaw, 32, diagnosed as suffering from ‘disorganised schizophrenia’, will be sentenced following psychiatric reports. Judge Francis Gilbert QC said that despite their failings, the pair had set out in June 2011 with the clear intention of killing Miss Stone. He told Liverpool: ‘It may have been a crazy scheme from a crazy person and likely to fail but when you decided to travel to Devon you intended to carry it out.’ Referring to Miss Stone, who is worth an estimated £10million, he continued: ‘You intended to rob her and kill her and dump her body in the river, according to your words, and then leave the country with your accomplice Junior Bradshaw.’ Guilty: Kevin Liverpool, 35, left, and Junior Bradshaw, 32, right, who . travelled to Joss Stone's home with a cache of weapons in their battered Fiat Punto . He added: ‘It is clear from your text . messages on your phone that from as early as November 2010 you had been . planning to rob someone for what you hoped would be in excess of . £1million. ‘By January 2011 you wanted a semi-automatic handgun and you had identified Joss Stone as the target. ‘You had no reason to target her except that she was a wealthy young woman as she was a successful singer. ‘You assumed as she was a friend of the Royal Family she would be able to give you money of that sort of amount.’ The jury at Exeter Crown Court took four hours to find the pair guilty of conspiracy to rob and kill Miss Stone. Relief: Joss Stone's mother Wendy Joseph, who has attended the trial every day, said she was pleased the defendants were 'no longer in a position to cause harm to anyone' after the verdicts . The pop star, who was at home at the . time – with the doors of her £500,000 property unlocked – told the court . that she had been enjoying ‘a really nice day’ until officers told her . about the plot. Joss Stone's mother Wendy Joseph, who has attended the trial every day, said she was pleased the defendants were 'no longer in a position to cause harm to anyone' after the verdicts. The soul singer said: ‘I am relieved . the trial is now over and that these men are no longer in a position to . cause harm to anyone. ‘I’d like to thank everyone for all their support and kind wishes.’ Liverpool and Bradshaw had driven down to Devon from the bed-sit they shared in Manchester in a battered Fiat Punto. They were equipped with a samurai sword, knives, hammers, a large metal spike, balaclavas, a hosepipe and plastic bags. When officers searched the men’s flat . they found a self-cocking crossbow and a BB gun. Police also discovered . ‘garbled’ notes about Miss Stone which referred to decapitating her and . questioned her links to the royals. Cache of weapons: The hapless defendants were also found with a hammer when they were arrested by police . The defendants were also found with this lock knife when their plot to kill came unravelled . Tools: A garden hose and black binbags which were also recovered from Bradshaw and Liverpool's Fiat Punto . Plan: A roll of black tape and a black sock which were also recovered from the vehicle . Co-accused: Liverpool, left, and Bradshaw, are shown sitting in the dock at Exeter Crown Court during their trial . Evidence: Joss Stone addresses the court during the trial in front of Judge Francis Gilbert QC . She had performed at a concert organised by Princes William and Harry, and attended William’s wedding in April 2011. The prosecution said the pair hated the Royal Family and targeted Miss Stone because of her connections to them. But despite their preparation, the . men’s defence lawyers told the jury that the pair were simply incapable . of carrying out the plot. It began to unravel towards the end . of their journey to Devon, when they left a motorway services forecourt . without paying for fuel, before crashing into railings. Police attended but did not search . the badly damaged vehicle and were unaware of the petrol theft, allowing . the pair to continue their journey. They then got lost in the country . lanes surrounding Miss Stone’s home. Stash: A samurai sword found in the boot of the Fiat Punto that Kevin Liverpool and Junior Bradshaw had driven to Cullohampton, Devon, from their home in Manchester . Chilling: A pistol was recovered when police carried out raids on the defendants' home in Manchester . Weaponry: This crossbow was recovered during raids on the property Bradshaw and Liverpool shared in Manchester . Caught: The two men's arrest, just a few miles from Miss Stone's home was captured on CCTV . At one point they showed a postman a . picture of the singer and asked if he knew where she lived. Their odd . behaviour alerted the suspicions of local residents, several of whom . called the police. As she gave evidence last month Miss Stone admitted security at her home was lax. She claimed: ‘I’ve lived in Devon for . a long time and nobody really shuts their door.’ During the trial, . psychiatrist Dr Michael Alcock said Bradshaw suffered from disorganised . schizophrenia and had an extremely poor concept of time. He explained: ‘Each day is the same . to him. He is like a goldfish in a bowl.’ And Liverpool’s own lawyer . described his client as a ‘fantasist’. A relative of Bradshaw told the Mail: . ‘In criminal history there has always been one who was the brawn and . one who was the brains – but these two were neither. Bungled: The Fiat Punto the pair were travelling in crashed on the way south from Manchester and they were spoken to by police .

The Chinese hacking was so brazen that a top McCain foreign policy adviser received a phone call from a senior Chinese diplomat complaining about a supportive letter that McCain had penned to the newly elected president of Taiwan - but not even sent yet. Rivals Who Were Both Hacked: US President-elect Barack Obama speaks with former Republican presidential candidate Arizona Senator John McCain at Obama's transition offices in Chicago on November 17, 2008 - it has emerged China hacked both campaigns . Tensions between the world's top two economies has been growing slowly over the past decade and Beijing's compelling attacks on American computer networks to steal classified information and high tech weapons designs is pushing Washington to the end of its tether. 'Based on everything I know, this was a case of political cyber-espionage by the Chinese government against the two American political parties,' said Dennis Blair, who served as President Obama’s director of national intelligence in 2009 and 2010 to NBC News.

Inside Sunnylands, the gorgeous Annenberg retreat in the California desert that is hosting President Obama and China's leader . 'They were looking for positions on China, surprises that might be rolled out by campaigns against China.' The high-tech infiltration of both campaigns networks continued for months and was first detected by the FBI during the summer of 2008 while the Beijing Olympics were being played out. CIA Headquarters - Langley, Virginia: U.S. intelligence officials discovered the hacking of both camps in the summer of 2008 and then President Bush ordered both McCain and Obama informed . The fact that Obama's political team had been hacked has been previously acknowledged in May 2009 - but it has never been explicitly stated that China was behind the hack until now. Indeed, the timing of this confirmation on the eve of the anticipated Californian summit between President Obama and Xi seems part of an American strategy to ramp up the pressure on the communist country to halt its rampant cyber-espionage campaign. Speaking to NBC News, officials and former campaign team members from both the Obama and McCain camps admit that the security breaches were more serious than previously recognized. 'There’s been successful exfiltration of data from government agencies by the Chinese up and down Pennsylvania Avenue,' said Shawn Henry, who headed up the FBI’s probe of the 2008 attacks as the bureau’s chief of cyber-investigations. Also speaking to NBC News was David Plouffe, Obama's campaign manager from 2008 - who remembers his phone call from Josh Bolton, then President George W. Bush's chief of staff in August 2008 to alert him to the data theft. 'He said we have reason to believe that your campaign system has been penetrated  by a foreign entity,' Plouffe said in an interview with NBC News. Hacked: David Plouffe (left), Obama campaign manager, vividly recalls getting a phone call from Josh Bolton informing him while Trevor Potter (right), with McCain also remembers the shocking revelation . While the world's eyes were on Beijing during the 2008 Olympics - Chinese eyes were pouring over the records of McCain and Obama's campaign records . The Obama campaign discovered that the Chinese hackers had used a simple 'phishing' email that contained a zip file with 'malware' that staffers clicked on and which infiltrated the systems. However, the virus inside the malware was extraordinarily sophisticated and could have stayed buried for months if not years undetected stealing classified information. Over at McCain's campaign, Trevor Potter who served as general counsel for the Arizona senator was also briefed by the FBI that hacking was taking place. 'They told us, ‘You've been compromised, your computers are under the control of someone else. You need to get off network’,' said Potter to NBC News. The most vivid example of the level of open intrusion that the Chinese hackers exhibited was when they appeared to have got access to a private correspondence between McCain and the newly elected president of Taiwan.

Incriminating: The letter (left) not-yet-sent by the McCain camp to the president of Taiwan - and (right) President Obama and Michelle Obama on his inauguration day in 2009 . On July 25th, 2008, McCain signed a letter, drafted onto campaign computers, which pledged ongoing support for the U.S.-Taiwanese relationship. However, before the letter was even sent, a senior Chinese diplomat phoned Randall Shriver who was working with McCain to express their displeasure. 'He was putting me on notice that they knew this was going on,' said Shriver to NBC News. 'It certainly struck me as odd that they would be so well-informed.' A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington said they were too busy to comment because they were working on this weekend's upcoming summit between President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping in California. However, contrary to U.S. accusations, Zheng Zeguang, the assistant Chinese foreign minister said that 'China opposes all forms of cyberattacks' in a press Beijing press briefing last week. Top of Barack Obama's agenda this weekend is cyber-espionage and U.S. officials are said to be sick of it and want it to stop. A recent report from a U.S. commission chaired by former Intelligence Director Blair and former U.S. Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman Jr., estimated that the theft of intellectual property – mostly from China – was costing the U.S. $300 billion a year.","On the eve of U.S. - China summit in California - it is revealed that Chinese hackers infiltrated McCain and Obama's campaign networks in 2008 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . CREATED: . 05:42 EST, 25 June 2012 . A burglar begging a judge to send him to prison must be a rare sight in any court. And in the case of housebreaker Kierran Batchelor, the reason  was equally unusual – his 10am meetings with his probation officer were wrecking his sleep patterns. The 21-year-old had originally been handed a suspended 40-week sentence and supervision order after he burgled two houses in February. The judge was prepared to give Kierran Batchelor a second chance, but he turned it down . Kierran Batchelor committed to house burglaries . But weeks after walking free from court he was back before a judge after missing his daily meetings with his probation officer. Batchelor told the judge he failed to attend the meetings because they were too early in the day – despite being at 10am. Recorder David Herbert told Batchelor he was willing to give him a second chance when he appeared at Coventry Crown Court on Friday. But astonishingly, Batchelor was jailed after he asked to be sent to prison so he could catch up on his sleep. Batchelor, who represented himself, was working 10pm-6am in a warehouse. He told Recorder Herbert: ‘I was not finishing work until 6am and had to be at probation at 10am. It wrecked my sleep pattern. It was getting too much. I’d rather go to jail and get it out the way, come out and get a fresh start, and not have to do probation and things like that.’ Mr Herbert asked Batchelor: ‘Have you given up on the order?’ He replied: ‘Yes.’ Matthew Barnes, prosecuting, told the court: ‘He has told me that he has insufficient motivation to attempt to comply with the order. He is resigned to the suspended sentence being imposed.’ Sentencing him to 40 weeks in prison, Recorder Herbert told Batchelor: ‘You have failed to co-operate with the requirements of the order. In those circumstances I am going to activate the 40-week sentence. You were given a chance and you have not taken it.’ Grinning Batchelor, from Coventry, even thanked the judge as he was being led away. He was originally sentenced on April 20 after committing two burglaries in Coventry in February. As well as the suspended sentence he was given six months of drug rehabilitation and 18 months’ supervision. He later tested positive for cannabis and failed to attend any appointments after May 18. The 39 days Batchelor spent on remand in March and April will count towards his sentence. Kierran Batchelor took to Facebook to share his excitement at being released from remand after his initial sentencing on April 20. But he later told a judge that daily probation meetings were 'too much' and asked for prison instead .","The judge was prepared to give Kierran Batchelor a second chance after he broke supervision order .

Ventians have reacted with fury after a cruise ship allegedly passed within yards of the city's historic banks while performing ‘a salute’ to a major company shareholder. Film footage of the Carnival Sunshine, which is owned by the same parent company as the notorious Costa Concordia, appears to show the 110,000-ton liner passing within 20 metres of the city's fragile shoreline. The ship botched its manoeuvre, squeezing a vaporetto water taxi and other boats between the ship and the bank, witnesses claimed. Scroll down for video . People in Venice have reacted with fury to footage showing a cruise ship which appears to pass within yards of the city's fragile shoreline - and show a water taxi, circled, squeezed between the liner and the bank . At the time of the incident an 150ft super yacht belonging to former Carnival CEO and major shareholder Mickey Arison was moored on the same part of the shoreline, the local newspaper Nuova Venezia reported, fuelling rumours that the manoeuvre was an in fact a sail-by salute. The incident raises the spectre of the Costa Concordia cruise ship, which sank after hitting rocks off the coast of Tuscany during just such a salute to the island of Giglio last year. Writer Roberto Ferrucci, who filmed the exercise, told the Italian news agency ANSA: ‘I was sitting at the café reading on the bank, as I often do, when I saw the ship tailing. Rather than moving towards the centre of the channel it almost brushed the shore causing a vaporetto to get caught dangerously between the ship and the bank. It was shocking.’ Carnival have denied any wrongdoing saying it was ‘a safe transit’. Witnesses claimed that the Carnival Sunshine botched its maneouvre as it sailed in the Venetian waters . Writer Roberto Ferrucci filmed the ship from a vantage point at a cafe and called the move 'shocking' But Venice’s proud residents are already up in arms about the presence of large cruise ships passing through the lagoon, with protesters last month calling for a ban on all those that pass by St Mark's Cathedral. The committee of the No to Big Ships group denounced the latest incident as ‘reckless’. A statement said: ‘The reckless manoeuvre or error destroys the argument that an accident in St Mark's basin is impossible.’ Local councillor Beppe Caccia tweeted 'Shame on you Mr Mickey Arson, Sunshine putting Venice at risk.' For more videos, please go to YouTube Natennatre . Environmental group Codacons called for port authorities to seize the ship pending an investigation by prosecutors. Andrea Orlando, minister for the environment, said that the number of ships must be reduced. This episode 'confirms the high risk we are taking,’ he said. A statement from the cruise company said: ‘Carnival intends to prove that the few metres claimed by the witness are in fact 72 metres and that the brush is no more than a safe transit carried out in accordance with the rules of transit.' A spokesman said reports of a 'salute' were 'unfounded'. 'The passage through the Venice Lagoon occurred in full compliance with navigational regulations and well within the accepted parameters for distance from shore,' the spokesman said. 'The Carnival Sunshine passed more than 70 metres from Riva dei Sette Martiri on the planned route. The distance from shore has been confirmed by the Coast Guard, the local pilot association and Carnival Cruise Lines.'","Carnival Sunshine appears to pass within 20m of city's fragile shoreline .

Though much work is still to be done, the island off Manhattan will reopen its doors to visitors on Monday. Scroll down for video . Ellis Island in New York City will reopen its doors a year after being severely affected by Hurricane Sandy . The famous island's buildings were swamped by water from the hurricane which left it without power for months . Over one million photographs and artifacts are being kept in storage while buildings continue to be restored. Last year's Hurricane Sandy caused a surge of water to swamp its grounds, leaving it without power for months. More than 12million people passed . through the Port of New York between 1892 and 1954 after the US . government opened the first Federal station for immigration on the . island in 1890. It is has been estimated that more than half of the current population can trace their ancestry back to someone who passed through its immigration check points almost 200 years ago. This is not the first time the island's famous buildings have gone under restoration since its construction in 1890. The Ellis Island Immigration Museum is home to over a million photographs and artifacts . It is thought more than 12million people passed through the island's immigration checks between 1892 and 1954 . With its rich history in immigration the island has become a highly popular tourist destination . On June 15, 1897 a fire destroyed the complex of wooden buildings on the land which had been doubled in size in anticipation of the many foreigners who would come through its ports. Although more than 150 people were on the island, miraculously no one was killed in the blaze. The government subsequently made plans to reconstruct the station with fireproof buildings, the first of which was put up in 1900. In 1902 a hospital was added to the complex, but was overwhelmed with the number of immigrants requiring treatment before they could enter the country. Immigrants wait in line to board a ferry to New York after passing through Ellis Island in 1900 . Among the island's buildings is a kitchen and laundry house as well as a hospital and museum . The nearby Liberty Island was also affected by the hurricane last year but reopened in July. It was forced to close again during the government shut down . Though the station remained open until 1954, the number of foreigners in search of a new life was significantly reduced by the introduction of strict immigration laws in 1920 which put an end to the country's 'open-door policy'. The nearby Liberty Island was also affected by Hurricane Sandy last summer. Home to the Statue of Liberty, the small piece of land reopened in July but was forced to close again during the government shutdown.","Famous island off New York is to reopen after being damaged by hurricane last year .

'A lot of prayers were said': Angela Daly, 64, who was leading the school trip to Tanzania, praised the bravery of the pupils caught in the ambush . British schoolchildren were held at gunpoint by masked robbers and struck with machetes during a terrifying roadside ambush in Africa. Seven gunmen fired AK-47 assault rifles above the heads of 14 youngsters after holding up their truck in Tanzania. Some of the pupils – aged between 15 and 18 – were hit with the flat of machete blades as the attackers screamed: ‘I kill you.’ A tour guide was also stabbed in the back during the 90-minute ordeal. The eight boys and six girls – all boarders at Cranbrook School in Kent – were on an aid expedition to a school in Tanzania. They were travelling back from a visit to a game reserve when their truck was blocked by two lorries. The party was being led by Angela Daly, a former head teacher, who said: ‘We heard rapid gunfire from outside. We didn’t know what was happening because we were sat down on mattresses – we couldn’t see over the sides of the truck. ‘Then a man wearing a bala-clava climbed over the back with a machete. Seconds later another man came over with an AK-47. ‘Their English was limited but they said, “I kill you”. They fired from within the truck above our heads, which temporarily deafened a number of the pupils.' ‘The park ranger who was with us was stabbed in the back. It was not a life-threatening wound but nonetheless serious. ‘They hit a number of us, the pupils and myself included. It was always with the flat of the blade on the thigh.’ The ambushed happened in the Tabora region of north-west Tanzania .

Experts believe the oyster must be around 20 years old but in order to find out, they would have to cut into it .

Treptower Park is vast and a tourist attraction alongside the river Spree in the district of Treptow-Köpenick, south of central Berlin. It is predominately known for its huge Soviet War Memorial built to the design of the architect Yakov Belopolsky to commemorate the 50,000 Soviet soldiers who fell in the Battle in Berlin in May 1945, but it also contains an abandoned amusement park.

Local vet Reinhold Sassnau told German English news site, The Local, that the dogs also displayed symptoms of dehydration and a rapid heartbeat, caused by the drugs. While fatal cases are rare, dogs that are not taken to the vet quickly can have to stay in a clinic for some time while they stabilise. Dogs taken to the vet's immediately receive an emetic, which forces them to vomit up what they have eaten, in order to get the drugs out of their system. A student told the newspaper that he had to take his 10-year-old dog Bob to a vet after taking him for a walk through Görlitzer Park, which is a well known spot for drug taking. He said: 'We thought he was going to die.' Vet Jörn Bischof, who treated Bob in October said that similar cases of dogs that have got sick by accidentally ingesting drugs, are becoming more frequent. While dogs do tend to eat waste that they come across in parks, he suggested that owners try and train them not to, to avoid the increasing problem.","Vets said the excrement .

In total, one in six Americans have dumped someone, or had someone dump them, by text message, email, or through social networks. In total, one in six Americans have dumped someone, or had someone dump them, by text message, email, or through social networks. Despite the trend being more popular among younger people, seven per cent of over 50s admitted to resorting to text or email to end a relationship . College-educated singles aged between 20 and 40 are the most prolific users of online dating, according to research from Princeton Survey Research Associates. One in 10 internet users now turning to dating websites - up from just three per cent of American adults in 2008. Similarly, seven per cent of smartphone users say that they have used a dating app on their phones. And compared with eight years ago, online daters in 2013 are more likely to actually go out on dates with the people they meet on these sites. Sixty six per cent of online daters have gone on a date with someone they met through an online dating site or app, up from 43 per cent of online daters in 2005. The figures come from the study carried out by Aaron Smith and Maeve Duggan at the Pew Internet Project. They surveyed 2,252 Americans about online dating sites, using websites and search engines during relationships and how technology impacts modern-day relationships. According to the findings, the most prevalent electronic heartbreakers are aged between 18- and 29-years-old at 22 per cent. However, 16 per cent of 30- to 49-year-olds admitted to resorting to text or email to end a relationship along with seven per cent of over 50s. The trend has been linked to the rising popularity of online dating sites, which has more than tripled in the past five years. As more people meet and forge relationships online, the researchers believe they are then more likely to end relationships in the same way. Women were found to be most likely to dump someone electronically, according to an online relationships study by Pew Research Centre in Washington. The most prevalent electronic heartbreakers are aged between 18 and 29 years old and the trend has been blamed on the rise in online dating sites . It's not all doom and gloom, though. Around a fifth of people who meet online go on to fall in love and get married.

Last night, Apple's CEO took to the stage ahead of the firm's latest iPad announcement and declared the tech giant recently sold its 170 millionth tablet computer. The announcement was accompanied by a simple looking line chart plotting the steady growth in iPad sales since the first model was unveiled back in 2010. Yet, news site Quartz took the chart and compared it with official sales figures to discover that not only is the chart 'misleading', it's been created in a way that covers up the firm's latest sales drop. New York-based journalist David Yanofsky recreated the Apple chart, pictured, using official sales figures and found the original, simplified version was 'misleading'. The pink line plots the actual cumulative sales, based on these figures, while the grey line is Apple's interpretation . According to journalist David Yanofsky: 'While that is a nice smooth curve, it . has little resemblance to the underlying data. Apple’s plot shows . cumulative iPad sales accelerating more slowly and more exponentially . than in reality.' Yanofsky plotted the official quarterly sales figures as bars along the x-axis, and used these to produce a more accurate cumulative sales line. This was placed over the top of the original Apple chart to highlight the difference. By showing the difference, Yanofsky was able to determine that at various points, the gap was wide enough to 'represent nearly 30 million units', which he claims creates a cumulative sales difference of around a third. Similarly, figures in the second and third quarter of this year show a drop in sales - which is likely to be due to the fact a new iPad was set to launch - yet the chart doesn't accurately reflect this. Apple's CEO Tim Cook, pictured, used the chart shown here to announce the firm recently sold its 170 millionth tablet computer. According to Cook, iPads now make up 81 per cent of tablet usage while competitor tablets combined make up just 19 per cent . Yanofsky ran a similar comparison when Apple announced its latest iPhones in September, and discovered a similar trend. He does highlight, however, that Apple hasn't overplayed the sales all the way through the chart, adding that although the distances between the labels are the same above 30 million, the gap between zero and 30 million is smaller. By creating this smaller gap, it gives the appearance of lower sales at the start of the first quarter. Also, for context, cumulative sales and quarterly sales aren't the same thing. Cumulative sales are, as its name suggests, a cumulative, overall view of all iPad sales since the first model was launched. Whereas quarterly sales look at specific sales over a three-month period so will reflect positive or negative growth depending on the time of year and other market considerations, such as new product announcements. Additionally, Apple is the first tablet maker to hit the 170 million-mark - a figure that is accurate - and iPads are said to account for 81 per cent of tablet usage. Competitor tablets combined make up just 19 per cent. New version: Apple's new iPad Air, right, is the fifth 9.7-inch model to be sold by the Californian-firm. It is 43 per cent thinner than the previous model and has a 5MP camera. The new iPad Mini, left, has a 7.9-inch Retina display and 10 hours battery life .

'I'm bored!' is a whinge many parents may hear this half term unless their offspring is glued to an iPad or TV screen. But as more studies have proved this week how children's health and academic performance can improve if they exercise, a sedentary break from school could do them more harm than good. So what can parents do to get their children active whilst having fun and being competitive when it doesn't involve an Angry Bird? Scroll down for video . Olympic heroes: The Brownlee brothers Jonny, left, and Alistair are encouraging kids to get active this half term . Olympic heroes Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee have the answers. The Yorkshire brothers say there are many easy and affordable ways to get your children moving whilst still having fun. Jonny, 23, told MailOnline: 'Active can involve anything. There are so many different ways to get your kids moving - you could build dens, play Pooh sticks, make an assault course or create a treasure hunt. It doesn't have to have too much structure.' His older brother Alistair, 25, added: 'Our parents were fantastic at giving us . things to do and showing us how to make fun for ourselves and just . enjoying being outside and active.' On your marks: The brothers have grown up competing against one another and love being sporty . The brothers love of being outdoors, running, cycling, swimming - and generally trying to be better than the other at whatever game they played - led to them becoming professional triathletes who took gold (Alistair) and bronze (Jonny) at the London 2012 Olympics. While sibling rivalry is often frowned upon or seen as a bad thing, the brothers are adamant it is what has driven them to glory. Jonny explained: 'Sibling rivalry has massively helped our careers. It's taught us how to . compete and not to be scared of competition. We can learn from each . other and spur each other on. If Alistair beat me at table tennis in the . garden I would go away and practise to be better so I could beat him. I . think sport can teach a lot of life skills.' He revealed he may never have become an Olympian if he wasn't inspired or pushed in training by his big brother. The brothers in action at London 2012: Alistair said having his brother nipping at his heels has spurred him on to gold . Successful sibling rivalry: Alistair won the Olympic triathlon last year while Jonny took the bronze . He said: 'I swam and ran anyway but might not have . tried triathlon if it wasn't for Alistair. And I . definitely wouldn't be as good. 'Alistair is a barrier-breaker with his . training and racing. Coaches used to tell him when he was younger, ""you . can't do that amount of training"" and he said ""yes I can"". 'I would have . listened to those coaches and done less training but seeing Alistair do . it made me realise I could too. I have learnt a lot from him. I remember . when he got his first Great Britain kit, I thought I want that.' Alistair adds that having his younger brother nipping at his heels has also pushed him to be the best in the world. 'You always want to beat your little brother and him catching up with me pushes me to go forward a bit more,' he said. Competitive: The brothers love to challenge one another . Get active: The brothers say joining a club and setting a goal is important to keep you motivated . The brothers admit when they younger they were competitive about 'anything and everything' but today they save their rivalry for racing. However, they also support one another when competing where they can, working together on the bike section and giving one another words of encouragement. And still nursing the pain of being outsprinted by Spaniard Javier Gomez for victory at the ITU World Triathlon Grand Final in September, Jonny admitted if he is ever beaten, he'd rather it was by his brother. Build your own assault course . Bob for apples . Play hide and seek in the great outdoors . Play Pooh Sticks . Build paper aeroplanes and see whose can go the furthest . Have a pogo stick race . Have a tug of war . Make a tree house . Have a breakdancing competition . Get on your bike . Thanks to their rivalry, the Brownlees were chosen to be brand ambassadors for Warburtons as their latest advert for their Half and Half loaf features two brothers squabbling over who is the best. Of their involvement with the campaign, which included coming up with the ideas to get children active at half term, Jonny said: 'It was a lot of fun casting our minds back to all the hilarious stuff we got up to playing together as kids. My brother and I spent many a school holiday making up games and challenging each other.' But aside from the fun activities like break dancing and den building that the Brownlees recommend, what they really want to encourage children to do is find a love of sport like they have. For children who want to follow in their footsteps, the brothers, who are now are targetting medals at next year's Commonwealth Games and the Rio 2016 Olympics, recommend joining a club. Jonny said: 'Parents should encourage their children to try triathlon and show them how . fun it is. Finding a club is important, every area should have one . local to them now. They can meet new people there and make friends who . they can compete and train with.' Alistair said joining a club is also important for adults who want to get fit. He said: 'Join a club or arrange a time to go out . with your friends. It's so much easier when you get home from work to . get out again if you know there's a group session you can join in or . you're meeting up for a run with your friends.' Jonny believes that setting a goal, such as a race, will also help children and adults stay motivated. To this end, the brothers recently staged their own event, the Brownlee Tri, at a National Trust property in Yorkshire. Thousands of people of all ages and abilities took part and it was such a success they hope to do more around the country in the future. British Triathlon provide information on their website (www.britishtriathlon.org/clubs/index.php) on clubs around the country and how you can join them. Thumbs up: Children who have taken part in British Triathlon Foundation Trust events have had fun whilst keeping fit . Future Olympians? The Trust have staged events around the country to get children active . A new charity founded last year, the British Triathlon Foundation Trust, is also making strides to get children involved in the sport. They have been visiting schools and staging events around the country where children can have fun whilst competing. Many of the events for children of all ages involve the traditional swim, bike and run whilst others have sections on scooters or duathlons (races where participants run then cycle then run again).

As firefighters emerge from another wildfire season in the Western U.S. scientists are working on giving them a 21st century tool - a fire-spotting satellite. U.S. researchers said such a satellite could view the Western U.S. almost continuously, snapping pictures of the ground every few seconds in search of hot spots that could be newly ignited wildfires. Firefighting resources could then be directed to these spots in hope of preventing the fires from growing out of control and threatening lives and property. This is an artist's concept of the FUEGO satellite, which would snap digital photos of the Western U.S. every few seconds in search of hot spots that could be newly ignited fires . The scientists, from the University of California, Berkeley, have designed a satellite using state-of-the-art sensors, written analysis software to minimize false alarms and have even given it a name – the Fire Urgency Estimator in Geosynchronous Orbit (FUEGO). They are hopeful it can be built for several hundred million dollars, either by government or private entities. 'If we had information on the location of fires when they were smaller, then we could take appropriate actions quicker and more easily, including preparing for evacuation,' said fire expert Scott Stephens, a UC Berkeley associate professor of environmental science, policy and management. 'Wildfires would be smaller in scale if you could detect them before they got too big, like less than an acre.' Professor Stephens, physicist Carl Pennypacker, remote sensing expert Maggi Kelly and their colleagues describe the satellite in an article published by the journal Remote Sensing. The satellite could help direct firefighting resources to locations to try and prevent fires from growing out of control, like this one in the Sequoia National Forest . Referring to the devastating 1991 fire that destroyed more than 3,000 homes in Berkeley and Oakland, Dr Pennypacker, a research associate at the university's Space Sciences Lab and a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said:  'With a satellite like this, we will have a good chance of seeing something from orbit before it becomes an Oakland fire. 'It could pay for itself in one firefighting season, he added. Professor Stephens explained that with global warming, wildfires are expected to become more frequent and more extensive. This year alone, California's firefighting arm, CAL FIRE, has responded to over 6,000 wildfires - 1,600 more than average - according to tweets by the department's information officer Daniel Berlant. Wildfire-prone areas stretching from Spain to Russia could also benefit from their own dedicated satellites. Fire detection today is much like it was 200 years ago, Professor Stephens said. It relies primarily on spotters in fire towers or on the ground and on reports from members of the public, although this information is augmented by aerial reconnaissance and lightning detectors that steer firefighters to ground strikes, which are one of the most common causes of wildfires. 'Even today, most fires are detected, in some way or another, by people,' he said. But satellite technology, remote sensing and computing have advanced to the stage where it is now possible to orbit a geostationary satellite that can reliably distinguish small, but spreading, wildfires with few false alarms. Dr Pennypacker estimates that the satellite, which could be built and operated by the federal government, like the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), as a partnership between government and the private sector like the Landsat satellite program, or by a private company alone, would cost several hundred million dollars - a fraction of the nation's $2.5 billion yearly firefighting budget. Fire detection relies primarily on spotters and on reports from members of the public, although information is augmented by aerial reconnaissance detectors that steer firefighters to ground strikes, which are one of the most common causes of wildfires. Here, wildfires destroy parts of Sequoia National Forest in California . The idea of a fire detection satellite has been floated before, but until recently, detectors have been prohibitively expensive and the difficulty of discriminating a small burning area from other bright hotspots, such as sunlight glinting off a mirror or windshield, made the likelihood of false alarms high. Today, computers are faster, detectors cheaper and more sensitive, and analysis software far more advanced, making false alarms much less likely, according to the researchers. 'Simply put, we believe we have shown that this kind of rapid, sensitive fire detection of areas bigger than 10 feet on a side is probably feasible from space, and we have evidence that the false alarm rate will not be crazy,' said Dr Pennypacker, who has designed sensitive satellite-borne detectors for 40 years. With global warming, wildfires are expected to become more frequent so wildfire-prone areas stretching from Spain to Russia could benefit from similar satellites, according to the scientists. They said the satellite could pay for itself in one firefighting season. The burned remains of one of the homes on Bonita Vista Road near Lake Hemet, California are pictured . Dr Kelly said: 'In concept, this is a simple system: a telephoto camera, an infrared filter and a recording device. 'We are just looking for something bright compared to the surroundings or changing over time . 'Then, we do these rapid calculations to determine if one image is different from the next,' she said. Dr Pennypacker and graduate student Marek K. Jakubowski developed a computer analysis technique, or algorithm, to detect these differences in space and time and to distinguish them from bright lights that might look like fires. This involves several billion calculations per second on images taken every few seconds, covering the entire West every few minutes. The new paper reports on tests of this algorithm using existing imagery from real fires, but the team hopes to get funding to test the system on a fire that is starting, such as a prescribed burn.","U.S. researchers said the satellite .

Researchers found people who could imagine the pleasure of deferred gratification were better able at resisting temptation . If you are unable to resist an extra serving of dessert or find it impossible to save money, the problem might be that you lack imagination. A study suggests that the key to defeating the temptations of instant gratification is the ability to picture what the future would be like if only we did not give in. So, if we can conjure up a detailed image of how slim we will look after dieting, we are more likely to be able to turn down dessert. And those who can vividly picture a bulging bank balance are more likely to save their extra cash than blow it. The . theory comes from researchers at the Brain and Spine Institute in Paris . who studied a group given the choice of small but immediate treats and . bigger ones they would have to wait for. The immediate option was presented as a picture, while the future choice was written out and had to be imagined. This was done to mimic real life . situations in which we have can see or smell an activity, food or drink . but can only imagine what life would be like if we didn’t give into . temptation. For instance, they were asked whether they would prefer to have a can beer today or a bottle of champagne in a week’s time. Other choices included an immediate body . massage versus future tickets for an important tennis match and the . option of bag of crisps straight away or a future lobster meal in a top . restaurant. Brain scans showed a region called the hippocampus lit up more in those who were best at resisting the immediate, smaller pleasures. The hippocampus is the brain’s memory hub and is one of the first areas to be destroyed by Alzheimer’s disease. The research, published in the journal PLoS Biology, found the ability to play back old memories is an important part of being able to picture a future outcome. Brain scans showed a region called the hippocampus lit up more in those who were best at resisting the immediate, smaller pleasures . To back up their theory, they showed that Alzheimer’s patients were particularly bad at delaying gratification. Study leader Mathias Pessiglione said: ‘Would you prefer a can of beer today or a bottle of champagne in one week? ‘Choices involving trade-offs between short-term and long-term outcomes are pervasive in everyday life. ‘The propensity to favour short-term pleasures defines a form of impulsivity that may have dramatic consequences on professional careers or family relationships. ‘The hippocampus is necessary for imagining future situations with a degree of richness that makes them attractive enough. ‘This structure has long been considered as essential for storing past episodes but scientists have recently discovered it is also involved in simulating future situations. ‘The consequence is that patients with hippocampus damage suffer not only from memory deficits but also from a difficulty in imagining goals that would counter the attraction of immediate rewards and motivate their actions in the long-run.’","Brain and Spine Institute in Paris conducted research on temptation .

After opening a clothes store, unveiling her eponymous fashion range and launching a YouTube channel, Lydia’s keen to position herself as a serious contender in the fashion and beauty world. Her latest project sees her working as a brand ambassador for imPRESS nails and Kiss nail wraps, which she told MailOnline she ‘jumped at the chance’ to be involved with.Scroll down for video . New look: Lydia Bright, who found fame on TOWIE, says she has ditched her entire make-up bag from the show as she stars in a new nail campaign . Lydia says: ‘Statement nails have become such a massive thing and nail wraps are huge this year. I’ve always been a fan of having pristine nails so I was thrilled when they asked me to get on board.’ Lydia describes her personal look as ‘quite 50s and glamorous’ because she loves red nails, bold lips and cat-flick eyes. Citing her all-time beauty heroine as Marilyn Monroe, Lydia insists that she has come a long way in the beauty stakes since she first graced our screens on TOWIE back in 2010. ‘I’ve ditched my whole make-up bag since then. When I was first on the show I used to use good products but applied them all wrong. New gig: As well as working on her own fashion line, Lydia has just signed up to be an ambassador for imPRESS nails and Kiss nail wraps . ‘My foundation was two shades darker than my skin tone; I used to use bronzer all over my face. I’ve ditched the really long lashes that were like spider eyes and I still use fake tan every now and then but not to the extent that I did on the show. ‘I think working in the industry and being alongside make-up artists and people in the know helps you pick up tricks,’ she said. Lydia’s favourite products are MAC foundations, Urban Decay eye shadows and Shu Uemura eyelash curlers. When it comes to budget beauty secrets, Lydia is a fan of the industry’s best kept secret: Vaseline to help her eyelashes grow. The 23-year-old admits that her hectic lifestyle has taken its toll on her skin. Now and then: Lydia reveals that she has shaken up her beauty regime since TOWIE (r) and now champions the glamorous 50s look, swapping her blonde locks for a chic brunette 'do . ‘I did a two-month tour with my store and I had major break-outs because I wasn’t sleeping that often and I was eating out a lot. I came back and it was awful. ‘I used 111 skin products to get rid of my spots and I love Rodial Snake Serum to tighten my face. I think skincare is something you should invest in,’ she said. Lydia revealed that there are some famous faces she admires. ‘I am obsessed with Kim Kardashian’s look; she is amazing. I love Abbey Clancy too and Jessica Biel’s make-up always looks insane.’ Inbetween providing prom dress consultations in her Bella Sorella store and filming a series of beauty and fashion videos for her online YouTube channel, Lydia has been working on her clothing line.

The European Union has fined Microsoft £485m (561 million euros) for failing to offer consumers a choice of web browser. Officials said the U.S. company had broken a legally binding commitment made in 2009 to ensure consumers had a choice of browser, rather than defaulting to Microsoft's Internet Explorer. It is believed the heavy fines will act as a warning to other technology firms such as Google involved in antitrust disputes with the EU. European Commissioner for Competition Joaquin Almunia announcing the European Union Commission has fined Microsoft £485m ($733m) for breaking the terms of an earlier agreement to offer users a choice of internet browser . Microsoft's share of the European browser . market has more than halved since 2008 to 24 percent. Google's Chrome . has a 35 percent share, followed by Mozilla with 29 percent, according . to Web traffic analysis company StatCounter. An EU investigation found that Microsoft had failed to honour that obligation in software issued between May 2011 and July 2012, meaning that 15 million users were never made aware that they could choose. 'Legally binding commitments reached in antitrust decisions play a very important role in our enforcement policy,' said Joaquin Almunia, the EU's competition commissioner. 'A failure to comply is a very serious infringement that must be sanctioned accordingly.' 'They must do what they committed to do or face the consequence.' The fine is the first time the European Commission, the EU's antitrust authority, has fined a company for non-compliance with agreed commitments. It could have charged Microsoft up to 10 percent of its global turnover, or as much as $7.9 billion. He said the fine was less than it might have been because Microsoft had co-operated with the investigation. A Microsoft spokesman said the company would respond later today. In all, the company has now paid a total of 2.2 billion euro (£1.9 billion) in fines to the commission since it began its first investigation into the company's abuse of market power linked to its dominant Windows operating systems in 1998. In that respect, the fine is relatively light, but experts say it still marks a firm sanction by the EU and will not go unnoticed by the likes of Google, which is involved in a dispute with the Commission over how it ranks search engine results. Google is under pressure to offer concessions to prevent the antitrust authority moving to the next stage in the case, which could involve fines. Other major technology firms are also in the Commission's crosshairs in other cases. Microsoft has a long and bitter relationship with the EU's powerful antitrust authority, which has now issued fines totalling 2.16 billion euros against the U.S. firm. Internet Explorer runs on all of Microsoft's devices, from desktop Windows computer to its new Surface tablet (pictured) In 2004, the Commission found that Microsoft had abused its dominant market position in relation to the tying of Windows Media Player to the Windows software package and imposed fines. Then in 2009, in order to resolve other competition concerns, Microsoft undertook to offer users a browser choice screen allowing them to download a browser other than Explorer. The Commission made that obligation legally binding for five years, until 2014, and initially the company complied. From March 2010 until November 2010, 84 million browsers were downloaded via the screen, the Commission said on Wednesday. But the Windows 7 service pack 1 rolled out between mid-2011 and mid-2012 failed to offer the choice, leading to the investigation that resulted in Wednesday's fine. Microsoft has said the failure was the result of a technical error and that procedures have since been tightened. The European Commission has fined US giant Microsoft almost £500m for failing to provide clients with a choice of Internet browser, as it had promised to do. In what was seen as an acknowledgement of the severity of the mistake, the board cut the bonus of chief executive Steve Ballmer last year, according to company's annual proxy filing. The Commission said it had taken into account in calculating the fine that Microsoft had cooperated by providing information that had helped speed-up the investigation. Analysts always found it odd that Microsoft would have purposefully failed to offer a choice of browsers via its software given that the potential fine for such a failure would far exceed any potential income from not offering it. Microsoft's share of the European browser market has more than halved since 2008 to 24 percent. Google's Chrome has a 35 percent share, followed by Mozilla with 29 percent, according to Web traffic analysis company StatCounter.","European Commission says company did not respect antitrust deal - and is first firm to be fined for non-compliance with agreed commitments .

A couple kept two dogs locked up in a filthy cage hidden behind a sofa for 22 hours a day for two years, leaving them emaciated and unable to walk. Karen and John Anderson kept two Staffordshire Bull Terriers in such appalling conditions, that the dogs had damaged teeth and were covered in sores and scars from trying to escape the cage. The court heard how female dog Jet, aged 10, and male dog Tye, aged 12, were shunned by their owners. The squalid conditions that two dogs were kept in by Karen and John Anderson at their home in Warrington, Cheshire. They have received suspended prisons sentences and been banned from keeping animals for 10 years . When rescued by the RSPCA on January 20, officers found the broken wires of the cage were bent back into place by Mr and Mrs Anderson to keep the pets contained, concealed behind an old sofa in a dirty, disused bedroom. Kevin Worthington, prosecuting, said both dogs were ‘emaciated with ribs, spines and skulls all visible’. They were rarely fed while trapped, with paws stained from urine and faeces. Neither dog could walk. The court heard how the defendants had two other dogs, both Dogue de Bordeaux, who Mrs Anderson described as her ‘babies’. They slept in the bedroom with Mr and Mrs Anderson and were treated as part of the family. The couple also kept Barn Owls and tropical fish. All pets have now been seized by the RSPCA. Jonathan Conder, defending, told Halton Magistrates Court that the dogs were separated because they started to fight.

'That wasn’t the right way to keep them. The treatment of the dogs is an aberration for people who have kept pets all their lives.'Mr and Mrs Anderson, of Warrington, Cheshire, remained impassive as the abuse was read out and they were sentenced to 18 weeks in prison, suspended for two years.

By way of comparison, the same study estimated global renewables subsidies of $88 billion, including $20-22 billion for biofuels. Last week EU energy commissioner Günther Oettinger was accused of attempting to conceal information on the full scale of the subsidies used for fossil fuels. However, 10 of Europe's biggest utilities are currently calling for cuts to renewable energy subsidies, arguing that they are driving up energy costs and distorting the power market. Some 38 per cent of this year's climate investment – $135 billion – came from the public sector, according to the CPI study. ‘There is some cause for optimism,’ said the report. ‘Although private investment has declined in general terms, technology costs for large-scale renewable energy have fallen further, perhaps as economies of scale start to take hold.’ Some 38 per cent of this year's climate investment - $135 billion - came from the public sector, according to the CPI study .","Report claims total of $359 billion is just a fraction of what is needed .

A critically ill nine-year-old boy whose body was ravaged by swine flu has finally received a kidney from his mother after doctors performed life-saving surgery, it emerged today. Robert 'Boo' Maddox, from Louisiana, is currently recovering after the seven-hour surgery which was vital to save his life due to complications from the the H1N1 virus. After contracting the virus - which killed more than 1,200 children in the U.S -  in 2009, he spent more than 500 days in hospital battling it and other infections. At the time, machines were acting as his heart and . lungs while he fought off near-fatal infections. His  pancreas and spleen were failing as were his kidneys, which could no longer filter his blood. Brave boy: Robert Boo Maddox contracted swine flu in 2009 and since then has been in and out of hospital and needed a new kidney to save his life . Recovering: Boo with his parents Robert and Renee and Dr Mikel Prieto, left, who performed the risky surgery at Mayo Clinic . Boo had to undergo surgery to fuse a vein and artery in his arm to enable blood flow so he could easily receive dialysis treatments - a procedure known as arteriovenous fistula. But as a result of this, the engorged vessel caused a blood pressure spike in his lungs, which meant a kidney transplant was not an option for him. Dr Mikel Prieto, who performed the risky surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, told ABC: 'He was told by many doctors that he was . not a candidate for a transplant. I talked to his dad and said, ""I think maybe we can fix . this"".' He found a way to reverse the fistula. 'It was scary in the sense of ""I hope . I'm right"",' he said. 'It was bold, but it needed to be done to fix . this problem.' Boo would have died if the move had . backfired. But the reverse procedure worked and the blood pressure in . Boo's lungs dropped to a normal level, meaning he was ready for a kidney . transplant. Miraculously, both of his parents were matches, but because his mother Renee was the healthier of the two, his parents decided she would donate her kidney. Fighter: Boo, pictured leaving the hospital in 2011, nearly 500 days after he first contracted swine flu . Dad: Robert, pictured in 2011, said the family have God to thank for their son's miraculous recovery . Renee is also recovering well from surgery and though it was a success, Boo suffered from a blood clot soon after which landed him back in intensive care. But father Robert told ABC he is doing well and are putting their sons miraculous recovery down to God. 'We've had nowhere to turn but look up. People say every day, ""I don't know how y'all do . this"". But the beauty is we don't do it alone. 'He's doing good now, talking to us. We've been to school [the last four years] on learning how wonderful life is and how each and every day is so important.' He also revealed that Boo is looking forward to eating real food again as he has been fed through a tube since December 3. 'He watches the Food Channel every . single day,' he said, noting that Boo's favorite show is the Food . Network's Dinners, Drive-ins and Dives. 'He wrote down every place . they've ever been and decided he's going.' The nine-year-old might also be able to go to school for the first time since kindergarten. 'He's never been to school except for . about two months,' he said. 'But he's sharp as a tack, taught himself to . spell and write. I taught him to count money and tell time in an hour.'","Robert 'Boo' Maddox contracted the H1N1 virus in 2009 .

Two maintenance workers have been charged with grand larceny after allegedly stealing $100,000 in old-fashioned bills from an elderly widow before blowing most of it in a spending spree. Elie Spencer, 47, and Joey Reed, 50, allegedly robbed Lois Brown in 2010 after she told them about a secret cash stash her late husband had hidden in the basement of her South Carolina home. Police said the sudden appearance of old-fashioned $100 bills in the small town of Gaffney, which were used by the two air conditioning workers to buy a car, lawn mower and television, led to their arrest. Sad: Elie Spencer, 47, and Joey Reed, 50, have been charged with grand larceny after allegedly stealing $100,000 in old bills which was hidden in widow Lois Brown's basement (house pictured) Gaffney Police Detective Brian Blanton said the $100 bills were printed before the federal government made anti-forgery changes in 1991. That includes the 1996 redesign making the portrait of Benjamin . Franklin on the front off-center and bigger. He said people in the small town of Gaffney residents started talking when the money surfaced just days after Spencer and Reed had quit their jobs. The drama began when Brown hired the men in 2010 to work on her home - a large, white, two-story farmhouse with the wrap-around porch that . she shared with her husband for decades before he died. She . told the workers just before her husband died seven years ago, he said . he had hidden thousands and thousands of dollars in the basement. Her . family had never found the money. If the workers discovered the cash, Brown said, they would be in for a big reward. After hearing about their free-spending ways, Brown went to Reed and Spencer and made an offer. Keep what they bought and a bit more money for themselves, give the rest back to her and she wouldn't go to police. They played dumb, and the law got involved, Detective Blanton said. Now the men are facing grand larceny charges, accused of taking the $100,000. And Brown has sued the owner of the company they once worked for to get her money back. She hasn't seen any of the cash from the workers, Blanton said. 'They quit their jobs the day after they found the money,' Detective Blanton said. 'And they didn't waste any time spending it.' Old-fashioned: Police said the $100 bills were so old, they didn't even have the off-center portrait of Benjamin Franklin . Brown's late husband had founded a business that sold small crane games, arcade games and other amusement devices. He also was in real estate and kept large amounts of cash around. After he died in 2003, his family searched for the cash he had hidden in the basement. Each time someone came to work at the old house, Brown offered a nice reward if the workers found the money. It was the same offer she made to Reed and Spencer in September 2010, but they left the three-day job without telling her anything, police said. The spending spree started a few days later. Spencer had the underpinning of his mobile home secured with bricks. Reed bought a $1,800 television, a $1,800 riding lawn mower and a $7,500 used car for his girlfriend. 'The man at the car dealership took the money to the bank to verify it wasn't counterfeit,' Detective Blanton said. That kind of money spent in Gaffney, a city of about 12,000 people, led folks to start asking questions. One of the in-laws of the men heard how the workers got the money and told Brown and police about it. After the men refused Brown's offer to not get the law involved if she got some of the money back, she called police too. Detectives tracked down the worker who spruced up Spencer's mobile home and he still had the old $100 bills. Others told police about their encounters. Spencer and Reed are charged with grand larceny and are awaiting trial. If convicted, they face up to 10 years in prison. Neither man's attorney returned messages from The Associated Press. An address for Spencer could not be found, and an eviction notice was posted to the front door of Reed's home. In September, Brown sued Dean Painter, owner of Painter Heating & Air Conditioning, which hired the workers. Her lawsuit said Painter should have made sure his employees were properly supervised so they didn't steal from her. The suit asks for $100,000. Painter didn't respond to a message from The AP. A man who answered the door at Brown's home, wouldn't identify himself and refused to say where Brown was. Brown's lawyer also didn't respond to phone calls or emails. Reed's lawyer asked for a preliminary hearing, telling a judge the charge should be dropped because authorities can't prove the money was taken from Brown's home or even that it ever existed. He compared it to a leprechaun promising a pot of gold, according to a report on the hearing by The Gaffney Ledger. The judge allowed the case to continue, and Detective Blanton said she believes the prosecution has a strong case, adding, 'We've got documents and proof they spent it like crazy.'","Maintenance workers Joey Reed and Elie Spencer charged after allegedly stealing $100,000 in old-fashioned bills from an elderly widow .

A SUV complete with rooftop drone and a surface-to-air missile launcher are just two of the cutting edge weaponry on display at a South Korean arms fair this week. Military and defence contractors from 30 countries descended on the country’s capital city to show off the latest technology at the Seoul International Aerospace and Defence Exhibition (ADEX). Big names such as Boeing, Rolls-Royce and Lockheed Martin were among the exhibitors as South Korea made plans to upgrade their guidance-enhanced missiles and buy 60 fighter jets and major aircraft to bolster their defences against neighbouring North Korea. Drive by drone: A SUV complete with a drone was on display at the Seoul International Aerospace and Defence Exhibition in South Korea . During the six day exhibition 68 military officials and chief executives from 45 countries are expected to visit the show to strengthen their defence industries, according to Yonhap News. A team of German pilots will discuss how a two engine, multi-role fighter operates while Boeing will show off their 737 Max Advanced Technology Winglet. Attack helicopters and aerial tankers will also be on display. Bolstering defense: A man tries out the 'Chiron,' a portable surface-to-air missile, at the exhibition as South Korea made plans to strengthen their defences against North Korea . First time show: India participated in the exhibition for the first time, showing off weapon systems and equipment, including this mobile launcher system, as more than 30 countries displayed their latest technolgies . For the first time India will be a participating exhibitor, displaying weapon systems, equipment and platforms developed in the country at the Korea International Exhibition Center (Kintex) in Ilsan, just north of Seoul. South Korea remains on alert after North Korea continues to fuel rhetoric that it is ready to launch operations against the country and the U.S. Earlier this month a spokesman for the North's military warned the United States of ‘disastrous consequences’ for moving a group of ships, including an aircraft carrier, into a South Korean port. On show: During the six-day exhibition, some 68 military officials and chief executives from 45 countries are expected to see military and defence equipment such as this EJ 200 Eurofighter Typhoon Engine made by Rolls-Royce . Impressive design: South Korea also exhibited at the show including this transport utility helicopter 'Surion' Defence plans: South Korea has plans to upgrade its guidance-enhanced missiles and buy 60 fighter jets and major aircraft to bolster defences against neighbouring North Korea . High alert: South Korea remains on alert after North Korea continues to fuel rhetoric that it is ready to launch operations against the country and the U.S. Pictured is the EuroJet 200 Engine . Reclusive North Korea has often issued threats to attack the South and the United States but has rarely turned them into action. Such hostile rhetoric is widely seen as a means to perpetuate its domestic and international political agenda. In March this year, the North declared it was no longer bound by the armistice that ended fighting in the 1950-53 Korean War signed with the United States and China, threatening to use nuclear weapons to attack U.S. and South Korean territories. The North has defied international warnings not to build nuclear and long-range missiles and is believed to have enough fissile material to build up to 10 nuclear bombs. The exhibition was established in 2005 in Seoul and in 2011 generated $9.97 billion worth of contracts.

Starbucks is offering a free coffee to any customer in the U.S. who buys another person a beverage in one of its stores - to show the government how to work together to end the shutdown. In a memo to all staff, CEO Howard Schultz instructed workers to give away a free tall brewed coffee to any customer who buys a drink for someone else between today and Friday. The offer is a way to help fellow citizens 'support and connect with one another, even as we wait for our elected officials to do the same for our country,' Schultz told staff on Tuesday. Paying it forward: From today until Friday, Starbucks is offering a free tall brewed coffee to any customer in the U.S. who buys another person a beverage at the coffee chain - to set an example for the government . Schultz wrote that he wants to do something about Americans' uncertainty over the federal government shutdown, the pending debt and default crisis and waning consumer confidence. 'In times like these, a small act of generosity and civility can make a big difference,' says an ad in The New York Times, Washington Post and USA Today. 'Let's see what can happen. #payitforward.' It's not the first time Schultz has waded into the national political debate. In 2011, he asked other chief executives to join him in halting campaign contributions until politicians stopped their partisan bickering. The CEOs of more than 100 companies, from AOL to Zipcar, took the pledge. Sharing: Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz sent a memo to all staff announcing the plan on Tuesday . Marshal Cohen, chief retail analyst at The NPD Group, said the latest campaign won't likely have much political effect because it lacks the kind of punishment that makes lawmakers think twice, like an impeachment drive. But it makes for great marketing, especially since many people, especially younger ones, care about brands that have a strong social conscience, Cohen said. 'Will it work on the political level? No. Won't make a dent. Will it work on the commercial end? Absolutely,' he said. A partial shut down of the government began for the first time in 17 years on October 1, after a partisan stalemate over health insurance reform in Congress blocked the budgeting process.","From today until Friday, Starbucks staff giving coffee to kind customers .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Ryan Gorman . PUBLISHED: . 17:39 EST, 5 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 00:18 EST, 6 October 2013 . The New York Police Department has released pictures of a third man wanted in the road rage assault of an SUV driver that took place last weekend in the presence of multiple off-duty police officers, including an undercover narcotics detective. The NYPD released the two photos and is asking for the public's help finding the person, whom the department is referring to as a person of interest. He has not yet been named, nor has the off-duty detective who witnessed the attack. Reginald Chance, 38, who police say is the biker seen in a video smashing his helmet against Alexian Lien’s SUV and yanking him out of the vehicle, came forward Friday night along with 35-year-old Robert Sims - who was shown in the video stomping on the driver's head. Do you know this man: He is wanted by the NYPD for questioning . In custody: Reginald Chance, 38 (pictured left and right) surrendered himself to police in connection to the Sunday attack on an SUV driver . An NYPD spokesman declined to comment Saturday evening as the unidentified person of interest's involvement in the attack. Both Mr Chance and Mr Sims have been charged . with attempted assault, gang assault and criminal possession of a . weapon, according to the New York Post. Mr Sims was seen on video stomping on the defenseless father's head, as well as punching and kicking him, of his terrified wife and two-year-old daughter. Mr Lien suffered two black eyes, as well as cuts on his face requiring stitches, according to a criminal complaint. 'The defendant is clearly seen stomping on [Lien’s] head,' assistant district attorney Joshua Steinglass told Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Diana Boyar during Saturday arraignment. A staggering $100,000 cash bail was set. Both men have lengthy criminal records, with Mr Chance's rap sheet showing 21 arrests for a litany of crimes including felony drug, robbery and weapons charges. Mr Sims' criminal past includes car theft, drug and weapons possession charges - including for a samurai sword. Meanwhile, NYPD spokesman John McCarthy confirmed Saturday that the unnamed detective believed to be an off-duty narcotics officer and member of a biker club was stripped of his gun and badge pending the outcome of an internal affairs investigation why it took the agent four days to come forward. He was riding with the Frontline Soldiers biker club, according to the New York Post. The papers aid the club also counts several others among its members. Mr McCarthy said internal affairs was also trying to determine investigating whether any other officers were present during the Sunday altercation and didn't immediately report it. It has been reported this week that at . least five off-duty cops witnessed the beating of Mr Lien, who was driving an SUV on the Henry Hudson Parkway last Sunday . with his family inside. The incident left Lien needing stitches and motorcyclist Edwin Mieses Jr possibly paralyzed. Among the officers reportedly riding in the biker rally were at least two detectives and three other officers who did little to stop the attack. One of the detectives, the undercover narcotics agent, watched as the . violence broke out and chose not to break it up for fear of ruining his . cover. Undercover officers are required to immediately report being a witness to a crime. Uniformed officers are required to take police action if they see a crime occurring, but the rules are murkier for undercover officers who face blowing their cover, confusing civilians who don't realize the undercover is really a cop and compromising years-long investigations. Before and after: Edwin Mieses Jr suffered a broken spine, fractured ribs, a punctured lung and a torn aortic valve and now may never walk again . The five officers were not the only ones present, WABC . is reporting that the NYPD is investigating whether several off-duty . corrections officers were also there. Police who saw the violent attack . did not begin coming forward until Wednesday - four days later. Investigators have already questioned some of the six individuals seen in the YouTube video of the assault, according to WABC. They plan to talk to as many as possible, the station noted. 'This is a complex investigation with a lot of people involved,' a source told WABC. One of the bikers who spoke to investigators said that Mr Lien 'drove erratically and bumped the bike on the side,' adding 'when he bumped that bike on the side, that bike became aggressive because his life was in danger,' according to WABC. The New York Post originally reported that the first undercover officer to admit being at the ruthless pounding was not the only cop at the scene, as several members of the motorcycle group- called the Front Line Soldiers- are police officers themselves. When reached Friday by MailOnline for comment, an NYPD spokesperson said only that the involvement of off-duty officers 'is under investigation.' 'It is does not appear that he got involved at the scene,' a police source told The Post, which added that the undercover officer has hired a lawyer. It started with this tap: Mr Lien's Range Rover tapped the back tire of this motorcycle, causing all hell to break loose . On camera: This shows the moment the Range Rover driver panicked and hit some of the bikers as he tried to get away to protect his wife and child. It is believed he hit Jeremiah Mieses here . Smashed: When they come to a standstill in heavy traffic, it takes moments before a biker jumps off and attacks the vehicle, smashing the driver's window with his helmet . He was not the only one to do so, as longtime partner of Edwin Mieses Jr, the man who was run over by the car, has hired famed defender Gloria Allred. 'He is the best father I know,' Dayana Mejia said at a Friday press conference. 'To learn that he almost died and that he may not walk again- that is all still sinking in. 'It tears me up that anyone could think that Edwin in anyway deserves what happened to him.' Mr Mieses was one of dozens of bikers who rode alongside a black Range Rover on Manhattan's West Side Highway last weekend until a biker slowed down and the vehicles bumped, police said. Video captured at the scene shows the SUV surrounded by helmeted riders. Damage: The broken window on the passenger side of the vehicle shows that the male driver was not the only target of the bikers' wrath . Scary: The Liens said they feared for their lives . Towed away: The car was brought to the NYPD's 33 precinct on Friday . In the video, one rider approaches the vehicle and peers into the driver's side window. Police said others tried to damage the SUV before the driver, Mr Lien, took off and plowed over Mieses. The . bikers then chased after Mr Lien and smashed his car window with their . helmets, then pulled him from the SUV and beat him to the point where he . required stitches. Rosalyn Ng, Mr Lien's wife, said in a prepared statement that . her family's sympathies go out to Mr Mieses, but that they had to flee a . dangerous situation. 'He is the best father I know,' Dayana Mejia, Mieses' longtime partner, said at a Friday press conference . Support: Ms Mejia, seen with attorney Gloria Allred and Mieses' father Edwin Mieses Sr, said that they are still coping with how to deal with Edwin's injuries . Mr Ng said her husband was trying to protect her and their 2-year-old child, who was also in the car at the time. Mr Mieses, from Lawrence, Massachusetts, suffered a broken spine, fractured . ribs, a punctured lung and a torn aortic valve, according to Ms . Allred, who said during a press conference that his injuries may have left him paralyzed. Pain: Ms Mejia said that it is wrong to cast any of the blame of the incident on her partner . 'He told everyone to move on and go back to riding, and turned his back to the SUV to start walking back to his own bike,' Allred said. 'It was then, with his back to the SUV, and as he was in front of it, that he was run over and crushed,' the attorney added. A difficult situation has been made worse by what she described as a 'perception' that some people have about the riders who participated in the rally on Sunday, said Ms Mejia . 'They are not gang members. They are not thugs,' Mr Mejia said. 'They are FedEx drivers, plumbers, military reservists, musicians. They are fathers and brothers and sons, and sisters and mothers.' She also said Mr Mieses, the father of her children, didn't know any of the people he was riding with on Sunday aside from one friend who traveled to New York with him. The potentially paralyzed biker was recently arrested in Andover, Mass., for driving with a revoked license. He also never applied for a motorcycle license. Records show that in June Mr Mieses was named a habitual offender and his right to drive in the state was revoked until 2017. It wasn't clear if he had been licensed in any other state. Fears: Lien needed stitches after he was attacked by bikers in New York on Sunday as he tried to protect his wife and child. He hit some bikers in a bid to escape them but they caught up and beat him . The large contingent seen on the video were participating in a periodic rally in which more than 1,000 bikers head for Times Square, police said. The Manhattan district attorney's office has charged one rider, 28-year-old Christopher Cruz, of Passaic, N.J., with unlawful imprisonment and reckless driving while authorities continue to search for other cyclists. Investigators and prosecutors are tracking down and talking to dozens of helmet-clad motorcyclists seen in the video, which was posted online.","The New York Police Department has released two pictures of a man wanted in connection with the savage attack .

Emma Thompson, pictured with Greg Wise, her husband of ten years, said monogamy is an 'odd state' She has been happily married for ten years. But Emma Thompson says she thinks monogamy is an ‘odd state’ and that the ‘disbelief and horror’ of infidelity is unrealistic. The actress, 54, who starred in Love Actually, playing a lovelorn wife mistreated by her cheating husband, made her surprisingly frank comments during a web chat on Wednesday night. Miss Thompson, who is mother to daughter Gaia, 13, and adopted son Tindyebwa Agaba, 26, also revealed she worries about the lack of decent role models for young girls, the lack of acting roles for women and confessed she is always on a diet – even though she believes they are the ‘spawn of Satan’. She said: ‘I do think that monogamy is an odd state, and actually I think it’s an odd state for women. ‘I think that we’re locked into certain ideas and certain romantic ideals that have shaped our thinking about relationships for some time. 'And I do sometimes wonder about whether there are alternatives, and about whether our fury and rage and disbelief and horror about infidelity is quite realistic. ‘All the fairy stories end when people . get married and go off into the sunset, there are very few stories that . deal with the nuts and bolts and actualities of serious relationships. ‘I . think that relationships are very hard work, that we can take our eyes . off the ball very easily, I think that children can be a huge strain on . relationships – it depends on what kind of relationship you have.’ Miss Thompson married actor Greg Wise, 47, in 2003. The Oscar-winning actress met Wise in 1995 on the set of the film Sense and Sensibility in which they co-starred. Miss Thompson’s marriage to actor Kenneth Branagh was falling apart and she has previously described how Wise ‘saved’ her. Thompson played a lovelorn wife married to a cheating husband (played by Alan Rickman). The actress said she wonders whether the 'disbelief and horror about infidelity is quite realistic' However the Nanny McPhee star said she doubts whether the ‘happy-ever-after ideal’ exists. She said: ‘All I’m suggesting is that there are other models and I’m also suggesting that we’d been a little bit caught by the happy-ever-after ideal. ‘All the fairy stories end when people get married and go off into the sunset – there are very few  stories that deal with the nuts and bolts and actualities of serious relationships.’ Emma Thompson seen speaking on This Morning in London today . Miss Thompson also confessed to being on ‘endless diets’, but  recommended that others don’t follow her lead. ‘Don’t ever go on a diet,’ she said. ‘Just don’t. Walk away. From the diet. Ignore the books. Ignore the magazines. Make the diet the D word. Diets are the spawn of Satan.’ She added: ‘Young girls have no role models these days, its sad. There is too much attention paid to being empty in popular media. 'There aren’t many roles for any women, old or young. There’s a bald patch between 40 and 55 because you’re not the romantic lead anymore or the mother (although that’s all you’re offered).’ Miss Thompson made her comments on a live web chat on the parenting forum Mum’s Net, to celebrate the release of her second children’s book entitled Christmas Tales of Peter Rabbit. It follows The Further Tales of Peter Rabbit, which was published in honour of the 110th anniversary of Beatrix Potter’s original series about the mischievous bunny. And Miss Thompson, who won an screenwriting Oscar for her adaptation of Jane Austin’s Sense and Sensibility, said she regrets not reading more to her daughter. ‘Read to [your children]’ she advised a forum member. ‘Read things that you like. Don’t worry about them reading for a bit, children don’t have to start reading until quite late on I think. ‘I think it’s nice to be read to and I wish I had insisted on reading to my daughter for longer before she thrusted me to the side. I think it’s so valuable to take something that you love and read it.’","Emma Thompson made comments during a web chat to fans .

With their snooty mannerisms and pompous long-winded descriptions, wine snobs have long been regarded as tedious, insufferable bores. And now what many have suspected all along has finally been confirmed; most of them are faking it too. A U.S. study, which used judges at the California state fair wine competition as test subjects, found that only 10 per cent of them realised when they were served the same wine again and again. Hints of pretension: Nine out of 10 wine experts failed to notice the same vintage being served over and over again . American wine maker Robert Hodgson, who has a background in statistics, asked organisers at the fair if he could run an experiment five years ago. The judges, who consisted of sommeliers, critics and buyers to wine consultants and winemakers, were given their usual selection of vintages to taste, but some of the wines were served three times, being poured from the same bottle each time. Duped: An earlier French study found that wine experts would praise a wine if it came from an expensive looking bottle . It revealed that even the most . highly-respected wine tasters are next to useless when it comes to . actually making any sort of reliable judgement about the relative . merits. Mr Hodgson, who runs the Fieldbrook Winery in Humboldt County, told the Observer: 'The results are disturbing,' says Hodgson from the , described by its owner as a rural paradise. 'Only about 10 per cent of judges are consistent and those judges who were consistent one year were ordinary the next year. 'Chance has a great deal to do with the awards that wines win.' The judges were asked to rate wines on a scale running from 50 to 100. On avergae a judge's score for the same bottle of wine varied by aropund eigght points over the three separate tastings. In one instance the same wine was first rated at 90 before dropping down to 86 and then rocketing up to an excellent 94. It isn't the first time the art of wine-tasting has come into question. A 2001 French study served the same wine to tasters from two different bottles - one labelled as an expensive 'Grand Cru' from Bordeaux, the other as a cheap table wine. The tasters were glowing in their descriptions after tasting the wine from the expensive-looking bottle, but critical of the same wine from the cheap-looking bottle .","Judges at California's oldest wine fair used as test subjects .

A boy of 15 was stabbed eight times in a frenzied knife attack at a bus stop as he walked his girlfriend home from school. Jake Anderson suffered a punctured lung when Dale Warburton, 17, lunged at him during a confrontation and knifed him in the back and side in Preston. Warburton's knife pierced the schoolboy's shirt, jumper and thick winter coat and the blade bent under the force of the impact, a court was told. 'Dangerous young man': Dale Warburton, 17, left, attacked Jake Anderson, seen right with his girlfriend Katy Singleton, with a knife as the couple were walking home from school in Lancashire . The frenzied attack only stopped thanks to the 'considerable bravery' of two boys who stepped in and grabbed the knife. A court heard Warburton was looking for trouble after sending messages to another girl who was known to both him and Jake. Details of the stabbing . emerged as Warburton was jailed for six years after he admitted . wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and possession of an . offensive weapon. The court was told Jake, who was initially treated for his injuries by the mother of his girlfriend Katy Singleton before being rushed to hospital, has now made a full recovery. Recovery: Warburton has been jailed for six years in the wake of the attack, which left Jake (pictured with his girlfriend) in hospital . Preston Crown Court was told the incident occurred at 3.30pm on January 10 after Jake met up with 16-year-old Katy upon leaving Ashton Community Science College. On their way home he spotted Warburton waiting at a bus stop close to Our Lady's Catholic High School and decided to confront him about the text messages. Warburton tried to board a bus but when the doors did not open he lunged at Jake and stabbed him, the hearing was told. Several other schoolchildren were in the area at the time of the attack, the court heard, which only stopped when two other teenagers, Ryan Hurst and Ryan Clegg, stepped in and overpowered Warburton. 'Anger': Jake, now 16, has said he has suffered with anger problems and stress in the wake of the knife attack . Jake was taken to Katy's house where his mother, who is a nurse, stemmed the bleeding from his wounds and dialled 999. The victim spent two days being treated at Preston Royal Hospital before being discharged. Warburton, from Ingol, Preston was initially charged with the more serious charge of attempted murder, but his guilty plea to grievous bodily harm was accepted. He was told that he must serve at least two thirds of his sentence and will be on licence for an extra five years upon his release. He was given an indefinite restraining order, banning him from contacting the victim. Couple: Jake's wounds were initially treated by his girlfriend's mother, who is a nurse, before he was rushed to hospital . Passing sentence Judge Anthony Russell QC, told Warburton: 'You have shown yourself to be a dangerous young man. 'Although you claim to have changed since your arrest and detention in custody, given the nature of this case and your history I consider public safety to be an important consideration in this case.' He added: 'Your actions in attacking him in the way that you did was out of all proportion to any threat you could have perceived from him and the fact that you had the knife with you is an indication you were looking for trouble. The evidence shows you completely lost your self-control. 'Fortunately others intervened. Ryan Hurst and Ryan Clegg acted with considerable bravery in tackling you and the evidence indicates your attack would have continued had they not done so.' Jake, now 16, said after the case: 'I was so scared at the time - it was the most terrifying thing that has ever happened to me. 'If it wasn't for Katy's mum I don't know what would have happened. She knew what to do. She wrapped a towel round my chest really tight to stop the bleeding. 'I kept asking her if I was going to die.'He added: 'I can't find the words to explain how angry I feel towards Dale Warburton. I have had anger problems, stress, my confidence has gone down and I couldn't concentrate in my exams.'Jake's father Craig, said: 'It has been terrible. You get the phone call you dread and they are saying ""your son's been stabbed and rushed to hospital"".'Now it is all over I'm just really happy about the sentence.' In a message on Facebook Katy said: 'At last he's been sentenced and no-one's got to worry anymore. He's got what he deserves and I hope something happens to him. I love you Jake.'Det Con Nigel Marler from Lancashire Police said: 'This was a violent and aggressive attack, which left the victim with significant injuries. 'I am pleased with the sentence given which reflects the severity of the incident. 'Any act of violence will not be tolerated and we will continue to do all we can to bring any offenders to justice,' he added.","Jake Anderson attacked by 'dangerous' Dale Warburton, 17, in Preston .

The 59-year-old woman and her husband, 72, were shot and robbed as they returned to their cruise ship after a stopover on the Caribbean island. The couple, named locally last night as Philip and Ann Prior, from Woodbridge in Suffolk, had been on a three-month P&O cruise. Mr Prior was shot in the side of the pelvis during the attack near the harbour in the capital, Bridgetown, on Sunday afternoon. Two Britons on a Caribbean cruise are recovering in hospital after being shot by an armed robber in Barbados . Passers-by tended their wounds, using . towels as bandages, until an ambulance arrived to take them to the . Queen Elizabeth Hospital for emergency treatment. Mr and Mrs Prior were said last night to be in a ‘comfortable’ condition in hospital. The Royal Barbados Police Force said that the attacker stole Mrs Prior’s handbag and fled. ‘It appears the incident was a . robbery,’ said a police spokesman. ‘They are currently receiving medical . attention but are not in a life-threatening condition. ‘They are talking to our detectives . to assist with the investigation.

The Adonia, one of P&O’s smaller vessels with space for 710 passengers, has left Barbados and was last night in St Lucia. The man, in his 70s, was shot in the left side, while the woman, in her 50s, was shot in the right thigh as they made their way back to their cruise ship .

Scaling back: 21-year-old Bank of America intern Moritz Erdhardt was found dead in his dorm this past August after working three days straight. In response to his death, banking institutions are remodeling their intern programs to scale back work load . Many Wall Street institutions are remodeling their entry-level programs in response to the death last summer of a Bank of America intern who had a seizure after working three days straight. 21-year-old finance student Moritz Erdhardt, from Germany, collapsed and . died in the shower at his student flat in Bethnal Green, east . London, after allegedly working through the night eight times in a two . week period. When he . did not show up for work, another intern who lived in the same flat . called the building manager, who found Mr Erhardt's body in the shower at . about 8.30pm on August 15. It is believed his epileptic fit was possibly caused by exhaustion. Mr Erdhardt's death has rocked the finance world, and now many banks are looking into taking the stress off young employees. Goldman Sachs formed a 'junior banker task force' that has decided the firm will no longer offer two-year entry level contracts and will instead make young employees full-time from the start. Junior bankers are expected to get more predictable hours along with opportunities to receive feedback from their managers. Working on the weekend will be discouraged. 'The goal is for our analysts to want to be here for a career,' David Solomon, Goldman’s co-head of investment banking, said in an e-mailed statement to Bloomberg Businessweek. 'We want them to be challenged, but also to operate at a pace where they’re going to stay here and learn important skills that are going to stick. This is a marathon, not a sprint.' Exhausted: Mr Erdhardt died from a seizure which his family believe was caused from sleep deprivation . According to the New York Post, both JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are looking into restructuring their entry-level programs. Following Mr Erdhardt's death, Bank of America formed their own panel to look into the summer program but have yet to announce their changes. Mr Erdhardt's death is even more tragic considering he was on the verge of a job offer after his internship ended. A source told The Sunday Times he was . about to be offered a £45,000 analyst job at the bank starting after he . graduated from university next year. The . source said: 'He was one of the best interns. They hadn't made him the . offer yet because they didn't get that far but it was going to happen.' Talented Mr Erhardt had already completed placements at KPMG Consulting, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank's corporate finance division before working for Merrill Lynch. Making changes: Goldman Sachs will now be offering new employees full-time jobs instead of the previous two-year contracts. Above, Mr Erdhardt is pictured in the center with friends . Mr Erhadt had studied business administration as an exchange student at the University of Michigan before attending WHU Otto Beisheim School of Managment in Vallendar, Germany. A representative for the Otto Beissheim School of Management business college where Mr Ergardt studied and from where he was due to graduate next year, called him 'a wonderful person.' Head of PR Peter Augstin said: 'We are all deeply shocked. He was a wonderful person and a dedicated student. He will be sadly missed. We are still trying to come to terms with his death.' His emails and swipe card will be analysed to discover . what times he entered the company's buildingnear St Paul's Cathedral . in the City. It is believed the student regularly left the office at 5am only to return to the flat to have a shower and change his clothes before returning to work. Dedicated student: 21-year-old Moritz Erhardt (pictured here enjoying time away from work) had completed several work placements . CCTV evidence shows him returning to his flat just after 5am on the day he died. Popular: Friends said Mr Erhardt (pictured left with a friend) called Mr Erhardt, pictured center, the 'superstar' of the internship programme . In an online portfolio Mr Erhadt told prospective employers that his upbringing taught him to always be driven to be good at everything. He wrote: 'I have grown up in family that expected me, in whatever respect, to excel in life. 'Therefore I have become highly competitive and ambitious nature from early on. 'Already during my times in elementary school I began playing soccer as well as tennis, I engaged in track and field athletics, and I started ski racing. 'Sometimes I had a tendency to be over ambitious, which resulted in severe injuries. 'With respect to my performance in school, I was striving for excellence and trying to be the best all the time.' Reflecting . on his intensive approach to his education he added: 'Over the last . year, I have learned that complacency implies stagnancy.' Mr Erhardt's father, Dr Hans-Georg Dieterle, 51, has said he does not blame Merrill Lynch for his son's death and he and his mother, Ulrike, will be asked to give evidence. Dr . Dieterle has said his son had been 'exploiting himself' and believes Mr . Erhardt drowned after suffering a seizure in the shower. He also called on the British Government to restrict working hours like Germany. A statement from BAML said: 'We are deeply shocked and saddened by the news of Moritz Erhardt'sdeath.

New pictures have been released of a prisoner who has been granted parole after almost two decades behind bars for killing her former pimp. Sara Kruzan was just 17 when she was told she would die in prison for the 1994 shooting of George Gilbert Howard in a Riverside motel room. But she will walk free after the Californian Governor Jerry Brown decided on Friday not to contest a state parole board decision to let her leave jail. Now and then: Sara Kruzan, pictured in July, left, and as a teenager, right, will walk free from jail after almost two decades behind bars . She had contended that he sexually abused her and had groomed her since she was 11 to work for him as a child prostitute. Her case became a high-profile example used by state Sen. Leland Yee, D-San Francisco, who sought to soften harsh life sentences for juveniles. 'It is justice long overdue,' Yee told the Los Angeles Times. He called Kruzan's case the 'perfect example of adults who failed her, of society failing her. 'You had a predator who stalked her, raped her, forced her into prostitution, and there was no one around.' Prisoner: Earlier pictures show Sara Kruzan during her time in prison . Kruzan's case garnered widespread publicity in 2010 after Human Rights Watch posted a six-minute interview with her on YouTube. The year culminated with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger commuting her sentence to 25-years-to-life with the possibility of parole on his last full day in office. Schwarzenegger said he still considered . her guilty of first-degree murder, but he sympathized with her defense . that the man she killed had sexually abused her and served as her pimp . for years. Clemency: Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger commuted her sentence to 25-years-to-life with the possibility of parole on his last full day in office . 'Given Ms. Kruzan's age at the time of the murder, and considering the significant abuse she suffered at his hands, I believe Ms. Kruzan's sentence is excessive,' the governor wrote in his commutation message, 'it is apparent that Ms. Kruzan suffered significant abuse starting at a vulnerable age.' This January, a Riverside judge further reduced her first-degree murder conviction to second degree, making her immediately eligible for release. Approved: Governor Jerry Brown has decided to allow freedom to a woman who received a life sentence when she was a teen for killing her former pimp . Yee's legislation to allow new sentencing hearings for juveniles sent to prison for life without parole became law in January. In September, Brown signed a second bill requiring parole boards to give special consideration to juveniles tried as adults who have served at least 15 years of lengthy sentences. Advocates estimate there are more than 1,000 prisoners already eligible for parole hearings under that new law. Brown's decision on Kruzan's case came nearly two weeks before the deadline for his action, Westrup said. The parole board was expected to act on the decision on Monday. Kruzan is housed at the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla. Her aunt told the Associated Press she wasn't surprised by the governor's action. 'I just wondered why it took so long,' Ann Rogen of Riverside said.","Sara Kruzan says she was forced into prostitution at the age of 13 .

The German Football Association announced that Trautmann, who played more than 500 times for the Manchester club after arriving in the UK as a prisoner of war, died at his home in Spain this morning. Trautmann, whose full name was Bernd, was best known for winning the FA Cup in 1956 despite playing the final 17 minutes of the game with a broken neck. As well as his Wembley heroics, Trautmann was also awarded an OBE for his work promoting Anglo-German relations after World War Two. He had survived two heart attacks this year, but died suddenly in La Llosa, near Valencia. Confirming his death, German FA (DFB) president Wolfgang Niersbach said: 'Bert Trautmann was an amazing sportsman and a true gentleman.

Trautmann became a hero in Manchester despite protests from around 20,000 fans when he initially signed for the club in 1949, with memories of World War Two still fresh. But he wrote his name into the history books when he dived at the feet of Birmingham City striker Peter Murphy with 17 minutes of the 1956 cup final remaining. The goalkeeper was knocked out cold as Murphy's knee collided with his neck and had to be revived on the pitch. In the days before substitutes were allowed, however, Trautmann was forced to play on and managed to make two further crucial saves despite being seen staggering around his penalty area in agony.

A celebrated athlete as a youngster, he was once awarded a certificate of excellence for his sporting prowess by German president Paul von Hindenburg. He worked as an apprentice motor mechanic before the outbreak of war in 1939 and joined the Luftwaffe, initially as a radio engineer in 1941. He eventually transferred to Spandau to become a paratrooper and first served in occupied Poland. Trautmann was court martialled and jailed for three months after a practical joke involving a car backfired and injured a staff sergeant but spent most of his sentence in a military hospital with appendicitis. He was part of a German advance on Dnepropetrovsk in Ukraine in October 1941 which failed because the cold weather halted their advance. He was promoted to corporal in the spring of 1942 and won five medals for his actions on the Eastern Front, including an Iron Cross First Class. Trautmann was soon promoted to sergeant and was one of the few survivors of the Allied bombing of Kleve in 1944. Trying to make his way back to Bremen with his unit decimated, he was captured by Allied soldiers. He was initially imprisoned in Ostend in belgium, before being transferred to a POW camp in Essex, classified as a category C prisoner by authorities.

His signing for Manchester City in October 1949, was met with anger from many supporters who threatened a season ticket boycott. But he soon won over fans. Despite being regarded as a legend at Manchester City, Trautmann was never capped by the German national side. He finished his playing career in 1964 with a testimonial in front of an estimated 60,000 supporters. After his playing days, he moved into management with Stockport before returning to his native Germany in 1967 to coach Preussen Munster.","Trautmann won the 1956 FA Cup Final despite breaking his neck .

A mass cremation was held today in the Balinese town of Ubud in which more than 60 corpses were burned. The ceremony, well known as Ngaben, was shared by mourners who could not afford to perform the ritual by themselves. Ngaben, which means 'turn to ash', is considered to be the last and most important rite in the cycle of a Balinese Hindu life. 60 bodies were burned today in a mass cremation known as Ngaben. The Balinese tradition is believed to release spirits from the burning bodies so they may reincarnate . In Balinese culture, cremation is believed to free spirits from the burning bodies so they may reincarnate or return to heaven. The corpses are placed in individual coffins and then in sarcophagi made of paper and wood which are burned at the end of a long procession. Buffalo shaped sarcophagi made of paper and wood burn in the ceremony in Ubud today . Traditionally the procession is not walked in a straight line so as to confuse bad spirits and keep them away from the bodies. The ritual involves holy songs and offerings, and is considered a joyous occasion for mourners who are releasing their loved ones from the restrictions of worldly life. The procession is traditionally not walked in a straight line so as to deter bad spirits from entering the bodies which will be burned . Unlike Hinduism in India, the bodies are not cremated immediately after death. They are typically buried in a funeral and then placed in a temple facing the sea. The corpses are then retrieved three days before the cremation, the date of which is decided upon by the community. Balinese Hinduism involves three rituals after a person has died, the cremation being the second. After the corpse has been burnt, mourners collect the ashes of bones of the deceased which are offered to the sea in a final ritual . During these three days it is common for the bodies to return to their former homes. Priests are never buried in this way, but remain in their homes after death until their families have gathered enough money to perform a cremation. Children carry a sarcophagus to the cremation site in Ubud, Bali. Unlike the funeral of the deceased, their cremation is a joyous occasion in Balinese culture as it allows them to reincarnate . Typically, mourners try not to cry during these ceremonies for fear that they will halt the deceased in their journey to the afterlife. But some communities believe the shedding of a tear towards the end of the ritual can mean the spirit has completed its journey. The joyous occasion involves offerings to the dead and celebratory music. Communities perform mass cremations to enjoy the best elements of Ngaben without having to pay for it all themselves . When the fire has burned out, the ashes of bones are separated from the rest of the residue and placed in white and yellow cloth with flowers. Once the ashes have been collected the 'initial purification' is complete, and the soul is ready for the third stage of ritual which is known as the 'final purification'. Mourners try not to shed tears during the ceremony for fear they will disrupt the spirit in its journey to the afterlife . During this ceremony, which usually occurs 12 days after cremation, the ashes that were collected are taken to the sea or a nearby river. It is believed that once the soul has been purified by fire which represents earth, it must be purified by water so it may return to heaven to begin the process of reincarnation. According to tradition, the deceased returns to human life in the form of the next born family member after these rituals.","The mass cremation took place in the Balinese town of Ubud .

A video games sales clerk has penned a letter begging parents to think hard before buying young children a copy of the mega hit, and ultra-violent, Grand Theft Auto V. In a heartfelt letter posted to Kotaku, the game sales veteran says parents are often too preoccupied or indifferent to notice that they’re buying sex and gore-filled games for elementary school children. ‘Last week my store sold over a thousand copies of GTA V,’ he writes. ‘At least a hundred of which were sold to parents for children who could barely even see over my counter.’ Scroll down to see Grand Theft Auto V trailer... Look carefully: A game store clerk says too many parents just buy extremely violent games like Grand Theft Auto V without understanding their graphic content . The fifth installment of the Grand Theft Auto franchise hit store shelves last week. In just one day, sales reached $800 million. Game maker Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. says the launch is the biggest of any game in the company's history. Past versions of Grand Theft Auto have been derided by concerned parents and other groups as inappropriate for children and some would suggest that a game whose main objective is to cause as much property damage and bodily harm as possible is inappropriate for any age group. Nonetheless, the Entertainment Software Rating Board gives the game—as it has all Grand Theft Auto iterations—one of the strongest warnings possible: an M for mature audiences of 17 or older. A 'deeply disturbing world': The state-of-the-art game cost $270million to make and some fear its realism and ultra-violence will adversely affect children . 'Last week my store sold over a thousand copies of GTA V,' writes the sales clerk, 'at least a hundred of which were sold to parents for children who could barely even see over my counter' Much like the ratings that deem who should, and should not view certain theatrical releases, a group called the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) rates all video game releases based on sexual content, violence, and other factors. They range from E for everyone—which includes games in the vein of Mario Bros.—to Adults only, for the most explicit of games.Grand Theft Auto V, like all its previous iterations, received an M for Mature rating. This means the ESRB recommends that only people aged 17 and over play the game.But with sales of Grand Theft Auto expected to exceed the $1 billion mark, it seems unlikely if not impossible that every parent is abiding by these guidelines. The concerned game seller is afraid an ESRB rating isn’t enough. ‘Over the years, I have watched the size, story, and graphics of games evolve to provide better player immersion and realism. This is true for all kinds of games, including M-rated games,’ he writes. But not every parent understand what the ratings are. ‘When I recite the phrases from the ESRB ratings box on the back cover of an M-rated game and it just goes right over your head I feel the need to be more specific,’ the writer continues. ‘So I mention things like a game having a first-person view of half-naked strippers or that the game has a mission that forces you to torture another human being.’ Even such a forthright explanation is often not enough, he writes. ‘In response, I often hear things like, “Oh, it's for my older son"" or ""All his friends already have it.”’ Sales of the game support this widespread indifference to its graphic content, and the writer admits his own love for such games. Advanced: 'Over the years, I have watched the size, story, and graphics of games evolve to provide better player immersion and realism. This is true for all kinds of games, including M-rated games,¿ he writes. The writer says he tries to convey to parents the graphic nature of games like GTA. ¿In response, I often hear things like, ¿Oh, it's for my older son"" or ""All his friends already have it.¿¿ . ‘Then I wonder to myself how often the youngest child watches the “older son” playing and if “all his friends” were to jump off a cliff,’ he writes. 'Now this is where those of you who are not parents will sound off with ""you should let them judge"" or ""I killed hookers in GTA III when I was five and I turned out fine."" That is great. I accept your opinion. Although, when your daughter comes home from elementary school crying because someone called her a b***h, you might change your tune.' The writer ends his plea with some simple advice: listen to the person selling you a game and just pay attention to what those games contain: . ‘I just ask that you look at the box, ask an associate for guidance, or just be more involved. Lastly, when I try to describe the content and warnings of an M-rated game to you, please don't ignore me and nod while scrolling through your iPhone.’ Awfully popular: One day after its release, Grand Theft Auto V had made a record $800 million in sales .","'Last week my store sold over a thousand copies of GTA V, at least a hundred of which were sold to parents for children who could barely even see over my counter,' says the clerk .

The two Florida students arrested for harassing their classmate Rebecca Sedwick until she committed suicide last month have been suspended from school. Katelyn Roman, 12, and Guadalupe Shaw, 14, were arrested earlier this month for stalking Rebecca. Rebecca killed herself on September 10 by jumping off an abandoned concrete factory. 'When you're accused of a felony you're automatically suspended from school for one year,' a source 'close to the situation' told RadarOnline. Scroll down for video . Suspended: Katelyn Roman ,12 (left), and Guadalupe Shaw, 14 (right), were arrested earlier this month for stalking 12-year-old Rebecca Sedwick who committed suicide on September 10. A source told Radar that they've been kicked out of school . Too young: 12-year-old Rebecca Sedwick (pictured above) committed suicide last month by jumping off an abandoned concrete factory . Since her arrest, Katelyn's parents have hired Casey Anthony's attorney Jose Baez to represent her. The same source close to the family said that Katelyn's family are worried about their honor-student's chances of getting back into the public school system. 'There is no guarantee that after a year you are allowed back into the public school system and that is if you are acquitted of all charges even,' the source said. According to the source, Katelyn had the third highest state testing score in Polk County a few years ago but now won't even be able to continue her education electronically. The two girls were part of a group of 15 girls who tormented Rebecca Sedwick at Crystal Lake Middle School in Lakeland, Florida. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said Guadalupe was singled out for arrest after she posted an insensitive tweet about Rebecca's death. 'Yes IK [I know] I bullied REBECCA nd [sic] she killed her self but IDGAF [I don't give a f***],' Guadalupe allegedly posted. 'We decided that we can't leave her out there. Who else is she going to torment, who else is she going to harass?' he said. Devastated: Rebecca Ann Sedwick, 12, pictured with her mother Tricia Norman, is said to have had a disturbing upbringing . But Sheriff Judd also announced last week that the bullying may have only been one part of Rebecca's decision to commit suicide. Judd said that Rebecca was also having problems at home and these may have contributed to the state of her mind on the day of her death. He told CBS she slept on a recliner instead of a bed and her sister slept on the couch, while the girls' clothes were kept in 'grocery sacks' in the living room. Rebecca's mother Tricia Norman has been in trouble with the law since as far back as 1995 and has criminal convictions for writing bad checks, fraud and probation violation. David Henry, the lead attorney on the . case, told Crimesider that Rebecca's father was not involved in the . family's life and that Norman 'was doing her best' with her children. Tragic loss: Rebecca with her sister Amy . Katelyn was Rebecca's former best friend, but Judd said the 14-year-old turned her against Rebecca. Other girls also stopped being friends with her in fear of being bullied, the sheriff said. 'Several students corroborated stories of both girls bullying Sedwick on different occasions, through name-calling, intimidation, threats to beat her up, and at least one actual physical fight,' the sheriff said. It is believed the bullying started when Guadalupe started dating Rebecca's ex-boyfriend. Witnesses told investigators she sent messages to Rebecca, calling her ugly, telling her to 'drink bleach and die', and encouraging her to kill herself. Rebecca's computer searches revealed she had searched for ways to commit suicide and asked questions like, 'What is overweight for a 13-year-old girl' . One of the Florida girl's screensavers also showed Rebecca with her head resting on a railroad track. Aftermath: Rebecca's sister Summer (left) and a friend sign a poster after her death. Two people have now been arrested in connection with the bullying . She changed one of her online screen names to 'That Dead Girl.' She messaged a boy: 'I'm jumping.' Polk County Sheriff Judd said Rebecca had been 'absolutely terrorized' by the other girls. 'We can see from what we've been investigating so far that Rebecca wasn't attacking back,' Judd said. 'She appeared to be beat down. She appeared to have a defeatist attitude. And quite frankly, the entire investigation is exceptionally disturbing.' Even when her mother took Rebecca out of school, the bullying was carried out online. The bullying started over a boy last year at Crystal Lake Middle School and at one point she was suspended for fighting with another student - believed to be Katelyn. Last December, Rebecca was hospitalized for three days after cutting her wrists because of what she said was bullying, according to the sheriff. 'When she was being bullied at Crystal Lake Middle, she used to come home every day and tell me how she wasn’t worth anything, that she was ugly, how she was stupid,' her mother Tricia Norman said after her death. 'And I said, ''Baby what on earth would make you think that? You’re the most beautiful person I know and the smartest person I know.''' Bullied: Rebecca was withdrawn from her . elementary school after being bullied and was home schooled by her mother Tricia (right) who says her daughter's death should be a warning to all parents to be vigilant . Later, after Rebecca complained that she had been pushed in the hallway and that another girl wanted to fight her, Rebecca's mother began home-schooling her, Judd said. This fall, Rebecca started at a new school, Lawton Chiles Middle Academy, and loved it, Judd said. But the bullying continued online. 'She put on a perfect, happy face. She never told me,' Tricia Norman told the Lakeland Ledger. 'I never had a clue. I mean, she told me last year when she was being bullied, but not this year, and I have no idea why.' Tributes: Flowers, candles and messages are left out in memory of 12-year-old Rebecca . Once police checked her cell phone they discovered that the bullying had not stopped, especially on Kik Messenger, Instagram and Ask.fm. 'They would tell her she's ugly, stupid, nobody liked her go kill herself,"" Ms Norman said. She has started a Facebook page to try to fight back against online bullies, called Rebecca Sedwick Against Bullying. Ms Norman told 10 News she was inspired to start it after reading her daughter's journal. In it, Rebecca had written: 'Every day more and more kids kill themselves because of bullying. How many lives have to be lost until people realize words do matter?' Ms Norman wants online bullies to face harsher consequences, and begged other young victims to stay strong and seek help, adding: 'Don't ever give up, like Becca did.'","Katelyn Roman, 12, and Guadalupe Shaw, 14, were arrested earlier this month for stalking 12-year-old Rebecca Sedwick .

It is hoped that his links to an al-Shabaab chief known as  Ikrima, thought to be behind last month's massacre, will also help intelligence officials locate 'white widow' Samantha Lewthwaite.

It is hoped that Warsame's links to al-Qaeda . will help intelligence officials track down 'white widow' Samantha . Lewthwaite, pictured . Warsame, who gained asylum in Britain 13 years ago, previously helped the US in the assassination of one of al-Qaeda’s spiritual chiefs in 2011 - Anwar al-Awlaki. He is also thought to have helped in detaining two other alleged British . extremists. Officials in the West have said the man's work - described in American court papers as 'high-level, international terrorist operatives' - as an 'intelligence watershed'. Warsame's role in the fight against terror has emerged in court documents as well as the testimony of an informant gained by The Sunday Times. A British security source told the newspaper: 'It’s hard to overstate the importance of what Warsame has been able to . tell the Americans, which they have shared fully with us.'

It’s a . double-whammy given his links to these two organisations.' The man, who became a terrorist warlord soon after gaining asylum in Britain, has links to both  al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Somali-based al-Shabaab. They are widely believed to be two of the most dangerous and active branches of the group. As well as Anwar al-Awlaki, the man's associates also include Ikrima, an al-Shabaab chief.

It is Warsame's links to Ikrima that are of interest to intelligence officers as he is suspected by Kenyan authorities of planning the Westgate shopping mall attack, which left 67 dead including six Britons. Also known as Abdulkadir Mohamed Abdulkadir, Kenyan national Ikrima has previously been linked to Warsame. A leaked Kenyan intelligence report shows that Ikrima is also an associate of 'white widow' Lewthwaite, 29, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. Al-Shabaab terrorists, seen here, are believed to pose a worldwide security threat . It is hoped that Ikrima’s capture could help discover her whereabouts. Warsame, born in Somalia, arrived in Britain in around 2000 and lived here for around six years. During that time he moved to Birmingham, where he was studying to become an electrical engineer. He then traveled back to his native country to fight with al-Shabaab in 2007. It is unknown how he became radicalised during his time in the UK. American citizen al-Awlaki, above, is thought to have inspired a generation with his internet sermons. On Christmas Day 2009 his organisation attempted to blow up a passenger plane above Detroit with an 'underpants' bomb. It also tried to attack US-bound aircraft with explosives hidden in printers. Awlaki was killed in Yemen in September 2011 following a US drone strike. He died longside Samir Khan who was the editor of Inspire - an online English language magazine. Two years later, he moved to Yemen to meet Anwar al-Awlaki - an al Qaeda spiritual leader. In April 2011 he was captured by Americans and was interrogated for two months on a US naval ship. In July of that year he appeared in court in New York, facing nine terror-related charges. There he admitted conspiring to teach the making of explosives including weapons of mass destruction. The man is hoping to receive a lighter jail sentence for his cooperation - and perhaps a new identity for the protection of himself and his family. In the past, several other al-Qaeda terrorists have worked with the West including Mohammed Junaid Babar, James Ujaama and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Babar was the main witness in the trial of seven men accused of plotting to blow up the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent. He was facing 70 years in US jail, but was released after serving less than five. Ujaama revealed vital details of an attempt by Abu Hamza to set up a training camp in Oregon. Mohammed was the alleged mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks who, in 2003, made a string of confessions about al-Qaeda plots.","Supergrass Ahmed Warsame, 27, is helping to find the .

Executive assistant Kelle Azzopardi claims she endured months of harassment from ex-boss Laura Giulini, who was then senior vice president for wholesale apparel at the luxury brand. In a wrongful-termination suit filed Monday in Manhattan Supreme Court, Azzopardi claims Giulini summoned her to a private office, closed the door, ‘then proceeded to take off her pants and expose herself.’ Former Armani SVP Laura Giulini, both pictures, is accused of sexual harassment and of exposing herself to Kelle Azzopardi . When Azzopardi turned her head away, Giulini told her: ‘You don’t have to do that. I’m not a prude,’ according to the suit. Azzopardi says she repeatedly complained to the human resources department at the company's Fifth Ave. offices in Manhattan, New York about Giulini’s behavior, but her complaints were ignored. She was eventually fired in November and claims it was as a result of her complaints. Giulini had left Armani the month before to become managing director of the French luxury goods company Zadig & Voltaire.

The Maryland Attorney General who was pictured at his son's drink-filled high school graduation party has continued to list off excuses for not shutting down the underage party. Doug Gansler, who is currently running for governor, said in a press conference that 'there may have been some college students or others drinking beer. I just don't know.' Two pictures of 50-year-old Gansler surrounded by partying teens have emerged, and in one he is holding up his cell phone in the direction of two boys and a girl dancing on a table. It appears like he is holding the phone as if to take a picture, but he denied that claim. 'I did not take any pictures...My guess is what I'm doing is reading a text,' he said at a press conference on Thursday. Caught in the act: Attorney General Doug Gansler is seen taking a picture with his phone in the middle of a party where recent high school graduates are seen holding SOLO cups . Having a look: Gansler, in the white shirt, is seen in the middle of the crowd of teenagers as he looks on while two teens dance graphically on top of a table . 'I should have probably (been) more observant and maybe determined whether or not there was drinking going on,' he said. 'I should have assumed there was drinking going on and I got that wrong.' In a second picture obtained by ABC News, Gansler is seen watching the dancing teens but this time his phone is out of sight. The issue is particularly problematic for Gansler since he has been an outspoken activist against underage drinking. His son Sam and a large group of friends were celebrating their high school graduation at a week-long beach house party in nearby Delaware. Not only was he present at the party but Mr Gansler was one of the parents who chipped in and paid to rent the beach house for the graduating seniors. In the middle: Gansler faces backlash over the photo because he has been outspoken against underage drinking . The Baltimore Sun obtained a list of rules that the parents gave to the partying teens, saying that there would be no coupling up in the bedrooms and no drinking hard alcohol. 'Assume for purposes of discussion that there was widespread drinking at this party- how is that relevant to me?' he said to The Baltimore Sun. He went on to use the fact that the party- which revelers dubbed 'eviction party' because of the intensity of the partying- took place in Delaware rather . than their home state of Maryland. 'The question is, do I have any moral authority over other people's children at beach week in another state? I say no.' One of the most incriminating photos was found on Instagram, showing the 50-year-old Gansler in the middle of a crowded room of dancing teens, holding up his cell phone as if to take a picture of two bare-chest boys dancing on either side of a teenage girl in a bikini. At a press conference held after the photo became public, Gansler continued to toe the line that he did not know if any illegal drinking was taking place. 'In this case, maybe I should have done something different,' he said according to The Washington Post. Campaigning: Attorney General Doug Gansler is hoping to become the next Democratic mayor of Maryland . 'If I had seen anything that was dangerous or risky... I would have done something about it.' He put up another defense as well, saying that while he did see plenty of teens drinking out of the distinctive red Solo cups- generally associated with beer pong- there was no way of knowing was was inside each cup. 'It could be Kool-Aid instead of beer,' Gansler said on Thursday. He went on to say that it was not his job to stop other people's children from drinking under the state age of 21. Family values: The 'beach week' party was held for his son Sam (right) and their friends who had just graduated from a private prep school called the Landon School in Baltimore . 'My responsibility is only to my child,' he said in an interview with The Sun on Tuesday. 'Everybody has their own moral compass. Mine is to raise my own child."" He said firmly that his son was not drinking.' The issue is particularly poignant for Gansler as he has appeared in public service announcements calling to end underage drinking. 'Parents you're the leading influence on your teens decision not to drink. It’s never too early to talk with your kids about smart ways to say no,' he says to the camera in one of the videos.","Doug Gansler, 50, is the Attorney General for Maryland and he is currently running to be the next Democratic governor of the state .

If you've ever been told that someone laughing behind your back is only jealous of you, they may well have been wise words. A study has found that some of us take pleasure in other people's misfortune because it is a natural human response to envy. By monitoring people's cheek muscles, scientists at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School found that people tend to smile more when someone they envy encounters difficulties - an emotion known as 'Schadenfreude'. Pleasure or pity: We'd be more likely to take pleasure in someone falling off their bike if we knew they were successful and we envied them . Delight at others' misfortune: Scientists monitored participants cheek muscles to see if they smiled at certain scenarios . The study was inspired by intense sports rivalries, with researchers wanting to find out more about why we revel so much in the failures of our rival teams. Susan FIske, co-author of the study, said: 'Jealousy and envy are highly correlated. When we ask people on surveys who is envied in American society, they report the same groups: objects of jealousy. 'This is all very much based on stereotypes. And so, in this study, we sought to better understand who is among these envied groups and whether that envy and jealousy elicits a harmful response.' Participants were shown photographs of individuals associated with different stereotypes: the elderly (pity), students or Americans (pride), drug addicts (disgust) and rich professionals (envy). These images were then paired with everyday events such as: 'Won five dollars' (positive) or 'Got soaked by a taxi' (negative) or 'Went to the bathroom' (neutral). Participants were asked how this would make them feel, and their facial movements were recorded. Ms Fiske said: 'Because people don't like to report envy of Schadenfreude, this was the best method for gathering such responses. Envy: The study found that people took pleasure when they were shown pictures of a rich business enduring difficult times . 'And, in this experiment, we were able to viscerally capture malicious glee. 'We found that people did smile more in response to negative than positive events, but only for groups they envied.' A second experiment, monitored the brain to see if participants were willing to harm certain groups and shown the same photographs. Participants tended to feel most positive when bad things happened to the rich professional. A follow up test to see if they would be willing to inflict harm on another person found that people were willing to hurt an 'envy target'. Finally, researchers used various scenarios regarding an investment banker as an example, to gain a response. The researchers threw information that betrayed steroetypes at participants. For example, in one article, the banker was himself, employed and status quo. In another, he was advising clients pro-bono (eliciting pride). In the next, he was using his work bonuses to buy drugs (disgust) and, finally, he was unemployed but still dressing to go to work (pity). Again, the findings matched earlier experiments – participants rated the articles associated with disgust and envy with less warmth than the pride or pity scenarios. Ms Fiske said: 'This experiment shows that the dimensions predicting envy are high status and competition, and, when you move those around, the envy goes away. 'This is consistent with the story about who gets envied and why. A lot of it is tied into money because that's an easy thing to look at.' Rivalry: The study examined how fans of Boston Red Sox (pictured) and New York Yankees felt about the successes and misfortunes of their rival teams . The researchers then applied their experiment to sports rivalry, taken fans from Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees and showing them a game between the two. Naturally, fans took most pleasure when seeing their own team do well. When a third neutral team was introduced into the equation, fans showed little reaction whatsoever to their fortunes. But they were happy when their rival team lost to the neutral team - showing pure Schadenfreude, according to researchers.","Princeton University studied the emotion known as 'Schadenfreude'

It would be designed to look like an eight-mile piece of parkland or an art installation at the water's edge. But it would serve a much more important purpose than brightening up lower Manhattan. This is one of more than 40 designs aimed at protecting the New York and New Jersey coastlines from a repeat of the catastrophic flooding that hit the area during Superstorm Sandy a year ago. The design, submitted by Danish architectural firm Bjarke Ingels Group and known as the 'BIG-U', proposes a system of levees and berms that would protect lower Manhattan. The 'BIG-U', an mile system of berms and levees disguised as art installations and parkland, was one of more than 40 designs entered into a competition aimed at avoiding a repeat of last year's devastating flooding during Superstorm Sandy . A plan by SCAPE, a landscape architecture studio, of flood protections at the edge of New Jersey's Barnegat Bay . The designs are proposed to avoid a repeat of the devastating flooding that hit parts of New York and New Jersey during Superstorm Sandy last year . But the system would be disguised behind murals and plant life, making it look more attractive than your standard flood defence. The plans were exhibited at New York University as part of a federally funded design competition aimed at protecting the area from future flooding. The 41 ideas range from the simple to the imaginative, with some proposing to drastically re-alter the appearance of the coast. Another design group suggested systems of artificial reefs, restored marshland and tidal flats that would take the punch out of surf hitting exposed coast and prevent big floods from pushing deep into bays and tidal estuaries. Some of the other designs take into account the potential for sea levels to rise as a result of the planet's melting ice caps. A group of designers called the . Unabridged Coastal Collective submitted a plan looking ahead to the year . 2080 on the Jersey shore. This design shows a plan by OMA of flood protections in Weehawken Cove, including a restored tidal marsh . Much of the area surrounding New York was left underwater following the devastating superstorm a year ago . It . suggested that, by then, people would get to what remained of Long . Beach Island by water taxi, rather than road, and visit amusement parks . that would sit on barges, rather than piers. It is hoped that the most impressive designs that come out of the Rebuild by Design competition will become a reality and some could be implemented using HUD disaster recovery funds. But the ultimate goal is to have flooding defences designed that could inspire similar projects elsewhere. Other ideas included a system of channels that would help divert flood water surging up from Long Island's bays and a huge water collection basin that could absorb floodwaters on Manhattan's low-lying Lower East Side. This picture shows the entrance to the Brooklyn Battery Bridge underwater in October last year . Cars floating in a flooded subterranian basement following Hurricaine Sandy in the Financial District of New York . In the coming weeks the ideas will be whittled down to just 10 by U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, who led President Obama's Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force. Henk Ovink, co-chairman of the jury that will be helping Donovan make the selections, told an audience of planners, architects and engineers the goal is to turn the broad concepts unveiled Monday into practical projects that could get federal funding. Working with the Rockefeller Foundation, the design teams spent several months doing research and touring storm-damaged areas while they prepared their projects. More than 140 teams originally entered the competition, but that number was previously whittled down to the current group of finalists. The devastating flooding, seen here in Staten Island in New York, cost the US some $65billion in repair costs . Rockefeller Foundation President Judith Rodin said in a statement that the competition is part of an effort to 'revolutionise' how coastal communities are planned. She said: 'We're eager to see which ideas move into the design phase, and hope that they all inspire new ways of thinking around planning and development.' Superstorm Sandy left swathes of New York and New Jersey devastated by flooding when it struck in October 2012. At least 182 people were killed and $65billion of damage was caused across the US. It was the second costliest weather disaster in American history behind only Katrina, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.","Danish architects submitted one of 41 designs to protect New York and New Jersey .

A Saudi Arabian air force sergeant faces a minimum mandatory 35 years in state prison after a jury found him guilty of raping a 13-year-old boy at a Las Vegas Strip hotel last New Year's Eve. Defendant Mazen Alotaibi, 24, remained seated, clenching his jaw but showing no outward emotion as the verdict was read in Nevada state court yesterday. Sentencing for the 24-year-old Royal Saudi Air Force mechanic, who had been in the U.S. for military training, is set for Dec. 16. Mazen Alotaibi, left, stands with his attorney Don Chairez as the jury entered the Nevada courtroom for the reading of his verdict yesterday . Clark County District Court Judge Stefany Miley could sentence him to prison for life. The jury of nine women and three men found Alotaibi guilty of sexual assault with a minor for forcing oral and anal sex on the boy in the bathroom of a sixth-floor room at the Circus Circus hotel, and lewdness with a child for fondling and kissing the boy on the way to the room. Alotaibi decided not to testify in his defense. Jurors instead saw a 70-minute videotaped police interview in which Alotaibi told detectives the boy offered sex for marijuana or money. After several minutes of denials, Alotaibi acknowledged to police that he engaged in sex with the boy. The Associated Press is withholding the boy's name because of his age and the nature of the case. Nevada state law says a child under . 16 can't give consent. But Alotaibi's lawyer, Don Chairez, said Alotaibi . was too intoxicated after drinking all night at a strip club to know if . he was doing anything wrong. Chairez spoke with jurors after the verdict and said outside court that he will appeal. Mazen Alotaibi, left, listens with his attorney Don Chairez as the verdict is read on Wednesday October 23rd . 'I believe, with hindsight, that it was a mistake not to have Mazen testify,' Chairez said, explaining that he believes jurors were left with evidence that his client had forced the boy to have sex. The defense attorney faulted himself for not fighting harder for the jury to be able to consider a lesser felony charge of statutory sexual seduction, which carries a possible sentence of probation or up to 10 years in prison. Prosecutor Jacqueline Bluth said the state was happy with the outcome. 'We didn't believe this was consensual and that the defendant was drunk,' she said. The Saudi Royal Consulate General in Los Angeles didn't respond Wednesday to messages about the case. A consulate official attended at . least one January court appearance. Chairez said he has been in contact . with consulate officials before, during and after trial, but no . government representatives attended the proceedings. Jurors heard five days of testimony and spent just five hours deliberating. Alotaibi had been charged with nine felonies, but was found guilty of six felonies and one misdemeanor. The . jury acquitted him of two lewdness counts that were offered as lesser . alternatives to the two most serious counts of sexual assault with a . minor under 14. Mazen Alotaibi faces a minimum mandatory 35 years in state prison after a jury found him guilty (pictured yesterday in the Nevada court room) Alotaibi was convicted of two other counts of lewdness with a child under 14 and one count of kidnapping, which each carry a possible sentence of 10 years to life in prison. He was also found guilty of felony burglary for entering a building with intent to commit a crime, and of misdemeanor coercion. The boy testified that he was waiting to go to breakfast with a friend when he approached Alotaibi and other men early Dec. 31 in a hallway at the Circus Circus because he smelled marijuana on their clothes and wanted pot. The jury heard that other men who lounged and smoked in the room shooed the boy away after learning that he was 13. Alotaibi followed the boy, out of the room, smoked marijuana with him outside the hotel, and asked the boy for sex, according to the boy's account. Alotaibi was seen on elevator surveillance video leaning down and apparently kissing the boy's neck on their way back to the hotel room. The boy is seen running back to the elevator about 30 minutes later. The boy testified that in the hotel room bathroom, Alotaibi blocked the door, offered him $150 and then doubled the amount, and forced him into oral and anal sex. A man who was traveling with Alotaibi testified that he knocked several times on the locked bathroom door while Alotaibi and the boy were inside, but they didn't come out. Bluth told the jury that Alotaibi wanted sex and wouldn't take no for an answer. Alotaibi rejected a plea deal before trial that could have gotten him a possible sentence of probation or up to 80 years in prison for pleading guilty to two charges each of felony attempted sexual assault and attempted lewdness. The boy testified last week that he was 'freaked out' and didn't know how to escape when Alotaibi made sexual advances toward him before raping him. 'It felt like I was trapped in a corner,' the boy said about the encounter at Circus Circus, his voice growing so quiet as he recounted the details that attorneys repeatedly told him to speak up. 'I was freaked out and I wanted to leave, but I didn't know what to do.' Mazen Alotaibi, a 24-year-old Saudi air force sergeant, is seen in his shackles in court during an earlier hearing . Mute: Mazen Alotaibi (right), seen here with his interpreter at an earlier hearing, admitted raping the boy when he refused to have sex with him . The . air force sergeant had bloodshot eyes and smelled of marijuana, the . teen said, and he ended up following the man to a room on promises of . getting pot for himself. He . said that while in the elevator, Alotaibi leaned into him and kissed . his neck. The boy said he felt awkward and 'I knew something bad was . going to happen', according to the Review Journal. Shortly . after, the boy said, Alotaibi offered to pay him money for sex, and he . verbally agreed to the offer in hopes of tricking the man and running . away before anything happened. The . teen said he ran off after the incident and reported the rape to hotel . security, fearing that he may have contracted a sexually transmitted . disease. Alotaibi's lawyer, Don Chairez, questioned the boy about why he didn't bite, scratch or hit the sergeant during the encounter. He . also pointed out that the teen has given different stories to different . people — he told detectives he'd been dragged into the room, but now . says he went willingly. 'I made up part of story so I wouldn't get in trouble with my parents' over the marijuana, he explained. Chairez has argued that Alotaibi was too limited in English and too unfamiliar with U.S. law to . waive his right to have a lawyer with him while he answered police . questions, the lawyer said. Alotaibi, . sitting handcuffed in a police interview room, never asked for a . translator and appeared at the beginning of the 70-minute videotaped . interview to waive his right to have a lawyer present. He also said he didn't understand why he was there. Police reported collecting DNA evidence from a used condom and a soiled towel found in the bathroom. The . prosecutor said DNA swabbed from the boy's neck, ear, chest and other . body parts was consistent with two people, including Alotaibi. Chairez has said the DNA evidence was inconclusive and showed no link to his client. 'Predator': Mazen Alotaibi, a sergeant in the Saudi Arabian Air Force, was arrested on New Year's Eve for allegedly sexually assaulting a 13-year-old boy in a Las Vegas hotel . Crime scene: Police said Alotaibi was staying at Circus Circus hotel on the Strip while on holiday when he sexually assaulted the teenager inside his sixth-floor room . Alotaibi told police he was drinking . Hennessy all night and was drunk when he met the boy. He first denied . allegations, but later admitted to raping the teen after he refused to . have sex with him for money. The . report stated that the 23-year-old Saudi national told investigators . that he had the boy perform oral sex on him 'for just a couple of . seconds,' and then 'accidentally' raped him. McGrath . said Alotaibi produced a Saudi Arabian military identification and said . he was stationed at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland near San Antonio, . Texas. U.S. federal authorities and Saudi military officials were notified, the police lieutenant said. Joint . Base San Antonio-Lackland spokesman Brent Boller told The Associated . Press that records showed Alotaibi is currently stationed at Keesler Air . Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi. Boller said he could not immediately verify if Alotaibi had been at . Lackland, but noted that international military students attend a . Defense Language Institute English Language Center on the base to . improve their English-language skills. The alleged attack took place on the sixth floor of a 15-story hotel tower.

The gunman escaped shortly after shocking scene unfolded, leaving the new father for dead. Mr Johnson was well-known to police, according to NBC Philadelphia, but a Philadelphia Police Department spokesperson declined to comment on his past when reached by MailOnline. Shot dead: Kontue Johnson, 21, was shot at least 14 times 'execution style' by a masked gunman . Security footage reviewed by investigators showed the masked assassin shooting at and chasing Mr Johnson through the store before the victim collapsed in an aisle, WPVI reported. The killer then stood over the his cowering victim, a young father, firing more than a dozen bullets – hitting him in the face and torso, CBS Philadelphia reported. ‘The shooter stood over him and fired several more shots, standing right over the victim,’ a police spokesperson told WPVI. ‘It's clearly an execution type homicide,’ the spokesperson continued, ‘this victim was clearly targeted.’ The shots rang out from a semi-automatic handgun, according to Philly.com. Friends took to Twitter to express their grief over Mr Johnson's death. 'I Didn't Think That Would Be Our Last Time Speaking Or Seeing Each Other,' one person tweeted. 'It just feels weird strolling down my [timeline] seeing his face & RIP next to it,' another friend tweeted.

A newborn baby was mauled to death by his grandmother’s pet Jack Russell as he slept in his cot, an inquest heard yesterday. Harry Harper suffered a fractured skull and brain damage after he was bitten by the terrier in his table-top carry cot when grandmother Teresa Bell’s back was turned. Mrs Bell had taken the eight-day-old infant downstairs to give his parents, Mikayla Bell, 19, and trainee electrician father Tom Harper, 19, a lie-in. 'Tragic': Week-old baby Harry Harper died of head injuries after he was bitten by his family's 'mild-mannered' Jack Russell, an inquest heard . 'Devastated': Baby Harry's mother Mikayla Bell, 19, is seen (left) leaving the inquest yesterday with his father Tom Harper, also 19 . In a statement read out to the inquest, she told how she had gone into the kitchen to see her twin 16-year-old daughters off to school and ‘assumed’ seven-year-old terrier PJ had followed her. She then heard Harry cry out and went into the living room to discover the infant covered in blood in the cot with the dog sitting by his feet. Harry was pronounced dead in hospital about 90 minutes after he was attacked in the family home in Ketley, near Telford, Shropshire, last November. The dog, which had never bitten anybody before and was usually placid, was put down. A Jack Russell owned by baby Harry's mother Mikayla Bell at the time of the incident . Mrs Bell said she left the sleeping infant in the carry cot ‘on a table against the wall’ as she waved goodbye to her daughters. She discovered the dog in the cot after rushing back into the living room when the baby cried. She said: ‘I heard Harry cry. I went straight into the front room and could see PJ sat inside the carry cot at a space by Harry’s feet. ‘He had something that looked like sick on his head. I pulled the dog out and carried Harry to the kitchen. ‘I remember he was bleeding at the back of his head. There was a lot of blood on his head and in the carry cot. ‘I realised straight away that PJ must have bit Harry. I was in shock at what had happened, thinking it was my fault.’ Harry’s mother, Mikayla, described PJ as ‘mild-mannered’. Miss Bell, a sales assistant and part-time model, said she heard screams and ran downstairs to see ‘Mum holding Harry over the sink’. She added: ‘Mum was repeatedly saying “I’m sorry, I’m sorry” and I heard Mum say “He’s been bitten”. 'Tragic accident': Harry's grandmother Teresa Bell, seen right outside the inquest with daugher Mikayla Bell and husband Gordon, had taken the eight-day-old infant downstairs to give his parents a lie-in . Miss Bell, a sales assistant and part-time model, said she heard screams and ran downstairs to see 'Mum holding Harry over the sink' ‘I think at some point Mum said it was PJ that had bitten him.’ Dog attack law changed . Miss Bell said she didn’t blame anybody for her son’s death, which she described as a ‘really tragic accident’. Her . 40-year-old mother told the coroner, sitting at Wellington Civic . Centre, near Telford, that she would ‘always wonder whether I could have . done something differently that morning’. Detective . Inspector Phil Shakesheff, of West Mercia Police, told the inquest that . the family had an ‘unblemished history of caring for and controlling . many dogs over a period of many years’.

His violin, which had been a gift from his fiancee Maria Robinson, was apparently found in a case strapped to his body when it was recovered from the icy Atlantic waters. Its re-emergence in 2006, when it was reportedly discovered in an attic in Yorkshire, prompted heated debate over its authenticity. Titanic specialist auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son insist nearly seven subsequent years of research and tests have proved it to be the genuine article.

A hidden network of aqueducts under Rome have been revealed thanks to state-of-the-art technology. Armed with laser rangefinders, GPS technology and remote control robots, a group of speleologists, who are archaelogists with specialist cave-exploring experience, are mapping the ancient structures for the first time. They abseil down access wells and clamber through crevices to access the 11 aqueducts that supplied Rome, which still run for hundreds of miles underground and along stunning viaducts. Exploring: 'Speleo-archaeologists' make their way through a perfectly preserved tunnel in a section of the Acqua Claudia aqueduct, in the grounds of a Franciscan convent in Vicovaro, Rome . Narrow: The team abseil down access wells and clamber through crevices to access the 11 aqueducts that supplied Rome . Ancient: A hidden network of 2,000 year old aqueducts under Rome have been revealed thanks to state-of-the-art technology . The mission of these 'speleo-archaeologists' is to update the last above ground map of the network which was created at the beginning of the 20th century by British Roman archaeologist Thomas Ashby. Alfonso Diaz Boj, a member of Sotterranei di Roma (Underground Rome), said he was 'proud' of the study. Among the areas mapped by the group is the perfectly preserved tunnel section of the Acqua Claudia on the grounds of a Franciscan convent in Vicovaro near Rome. Mr Diaz Boj said: 'It combines what was the birth of archaeology as a science with the latest instruments available.' The pick marks of the Roman diggers can still be seen in the limestone of the tunnel completed in 38 AD by the Emperor Claudius and a lawyer of calcification about half a metre off the ground shows where the water level would have been. 'These aqueducts may not be as beautiful as a statue or like some architecture but I think they are important, they are very beautiful,' Mr Diaz Boj continued. Maps: Their study of the aqueducts is based on the map made by Thomas Ashby, director of the archaeological British School at Rome, between 1906 and 1925 . Down you go: The aqueducts can be accessed in various hidden locations near Rome including a doorway near the Villa Medici that leads down a spiral staircase to the water . Access: People in the streets above may be completely unaware of the hidden history beneath their feet . Stunning: The Acqua Claudia runs 54 miles from the Simbruini Mountains to the heart of Rome and supplied 2,200 litres of water a second . The ancient waterways were true feats of engineering, which relied solely on gravity to ensure a flow of water from Germany to North Africa - across what was once the Roman Empire. Their strategic significance is underlined by the fact that Rome had a special magistrate to oversee their maintenance and that the Visigoths cut them off when they were laying siege to the city. The Acqua Claudia runs 54 miles from the Simbruini Mountains to the heart of Rome and supplied 2,200 litres of water a second. Only one of the aqueducts is still operational today - the Acqua Vergine - which can be accessed in various hidden locations near Rome including a doorway near the Villa Medici that leads down a spiral staircase to the water.The Acqua Vergine runs for just over 12 miles and ends up in the Trevi Fountain, photographed every day by crowds of tourists. 'Underground Rome is a final frontier,' said Riccardo Paolucci, another explorer, as he examined a viaduct in a valley near Vicovaro that carried the water further towards the city. 'Water was a fundamental service for hygiene. In a city like Rome, which had a million inhabitants, there were very few epidemics,' he said. 'There was a concept of service for the people, for the city. It is a key concept that is maybe lacking not just in modern Rome but globally.' Mr Diaz, Mr Paolucci and the others from Sotterranei di Roma work together with Rome's archaeological authority, helping them understand what can be seen above the ground from what is underneath and inaccessible without specialist equipment. Preserved: The Romans built curved sections deliberately to slow the water down . Graffiti: Ashby's signature can be seen scrawled on the wall of a section of the Acqua Marcia aqueduct alongside graffiti and poems dating back to the 17th century from visitors who stumbled on the ancient waterway . Tours: The group also organises guided tours and courses, including one on the aqueducts starting next month, and are earning an international reputation . 'We are who we are because of what we have inside and Rome is what it is because of what is underneath it,' said Mr Paolucci, a specialist potholer who is also called to emergency incidents or whenever a sinkhole opens up in the city. The group also organises guided tours and courses, including one on the aqueducts starting next month, and are earning an international reputation. They were commissioned to map the underground remains of ancient Ephesus in Turkey.Their study of the aqueducts is based on the map made by Thomas Ashby, director of the archaeological British School at Rome, between 1906 and 1925.

The first mission to the moon's south pole is being planned by two private companies that want to plant telescopes on top of a lunar mountain as early as 2016. The International Lunar Observatory Association (ILOA) and a start-up called Moon Express have chosen the tricky location as they believe the telescopes will get a clear view of our galaxy. They plan on installing a two-metre radio antenna, plus a smaller optical telescope on the elevated rim of the Malapert crater. The first mission to the Moon's south pole is being planned by International Lunar Observatory Association and Moon Express. They want to plant telescopes on top of a lunar mountain (pictured) in as early as 2016 and believe the telescopes will get a clear view of our galaxy . According to Wired, the ILOA has set its sights on building a scientific and commercial base on the moon, while Moon Express wants to become a space courier service in the next 10 years. The companies have now joined forces with the intention of setting up two telescopes on the Moon's south pole as the instruments will not suffer our atmosphere's hazy interference. The location also has the observational benefit of not picking up any radio or electromagnetic noise created by modern technology. The idea to place a telescope on the moon is not new. Astronomers have long thought about putting telescopes on the dark side of the moon that always faces away from Earth. It is hoped that pictures captured by such instruments would be clearer than anything taken on Earth or even in space. But telescopes in the location would depend upon satellite relays, which would be expensive. The beauty of locating telescopes on the Moon's south pole, however, is that the telescopes would have a 'direct line to Earth,' Steve Durst, founder and director of ILOA told Wired.com. Astronomers have previously toyed with the idea of planting telescopes on the dark side of the Moon, as they believe pictures captured by instruments devoid of atmospheric interference would be clearer than anything taken on Earth or even in space - the Hubble telescope is pictured . The spot on the Malpert crater also has the benefit of a slightly milder climate than the dark side of the moon. One 'day' on the moon lasts for the equivalent of an Earth month. It has two weeks of temperatures of over 120 degrees followed by chilling 'nights' that last for another two weeks when the temperature drops to minus 170 degrees. This means engineering scientific instruments would need to be able to withstand the extreme climate and this has so far proved challenging. However, as the telescopes would be situated at the south pole, they would enjoy sunlight for 90 per cent of the moon's day and consequently a relatively stable temperature of approximately minus 50 degrees Celsius. Solar panels could therefore be used to collect energy and power the telescope, according to Mr Durst. Due to the more consistent temperature and sunlight, he believes the lunar poles are the best locations for any future human settlement on the moon. The south pole of the moon is popularly thought to be rich with resources. Moon Express, which intends to provide the lander and engineering expertise for the telescope, has ambitions to mine metals, minerals and water on the moon. The telescopes would be situated at the Moon's south pole which has a relatively stable temperature of minus 50 degrees. Conditions on other parts of the Moon are much more varied. The companies believe the lunar poles are the best locations for any future human settlement on the Moon (pictured) The company believes resources could be sold to humans on Earth, while the water would be needed by astronauts living on a lunar base nearby. Bob Richards, the company’s CEO, told Wired.com that during the mission, he plans on sending a small rover to explore the surface of the site. The mission, planned as soon as 2016, is ambitious as the south pole of the moon has never been explored before. Mr Richards conceded that due to the amount of finance needed - around $100 million - and pioneering engineering necessary for the mission, the schedule is tight. However, he hopes that national and international space agencies will help to pay for the mission and that it will take place by 2018. Moon Express has not landed a probe on the moon's surface yet but aspires to land on the moon in 2015 to scoop the $20 million Google Lunar X Prize. The company is planning a mini mission to the moon to instal a shoebox-sized telescope with the aim of testing ILOA's technology on the lunar landscape. Two American politicians have proposed legislation that would establish a national historical park on the surface of the moon, according to The Hill. Democrats Donna Edwards and Eddie Bernice Johnson want to create a protected historical park at the sites of the Apollo missions between 1969 and 1972. They reportedly said that the Apollo Lunar Landing Sites National Historical Park would include all the artifacts left on the surface of the moon from the missions of Apollo 11 to Apollo 17. The text from the proposed Apollo Lunar Landing Legacy Act, reads: 'As commercial enterprises and foreign nations acquire the ability to . land on the Moon, it is necessary to protect the Apollo lunar landing . sites for posterity.' It would be run by the Department of the Interior and the National Aeronautics and Nasa, but first the  US government would have to submit the lunar landing site to the UN and ask that it is made a World Heritage Site. Ms Edwards and Mr Bernice Johnson are members of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee.","The first mission to the moon's south pole is being planned by the International Lunar Observatory Association and Moon Express .

Guy Fieri appeared in court on Monday to testify in the unusual case brought against a San Francisco teen accused of stealing the celebrity chef’s bright-yellow Lamborghini in 2011. Along with the theft, Max Wade, 19, is charged with the attempted murder of a teenage girl who had spurned his romantic advances and her then-boyfriend. Fieri took the stand for a testimony that lasted just a few minutes to confirm that he didn’t not know Wade and did not give him permission to take his $200,000 car out of a San Francisco dealership on March 8, 2011. Max Wade, right, is accused of stealing celebrity chef Guy Fieri's car back in March 2011 . The celebrity chef¿s bright-yellow Lamborghini was worth $800,000 and was missing for over 18 months . Prosecutors allege that Wade stole the car in a ‘Mission Impossible’-style heist to impress the girl, Eva Dedier, who is now 19. Then in April 2012 he attempted to kill Dedier and her former boyfriend, Landon Wahlstrom, as they sat in Wahlstrom’s truck. That investigation led authorities to Wade's storage container in Richmond, where they found the Food Network star's stolen yellow Lamborghini. Fieri told reporters outside of court that he is relieved the ordeal is nearly over. ‘It's been a really crazy story,’ he said.

During the 18 month period that the car, the chef said he constantly received calls from people who had spotted the vehicle. Fieri said he thought Wade’s story would make a great movie. ‘I'm sorry to see laws get broken,’ Fieri said. ‘This has so many other facets that are far more important than my car. My car is a very small portion of it. There's a bigger issue on the table.’ He said the insurance company took ownership of the car after it was found in Wade's possession at a storage unit. During closing arguments on Monday afternoon, Deputy District Attorney Yvette Martinez told the jury that Wade though he was a celebrity who ‘committed a celebrity crime to get the beautiful blonde girl.’ During the 18 month period that the car, Fieri said he constantly received calls from people who had spotted the vehicle being driven around the Bay Area .

A Pennsylvania man has been charged with harassment for allegedly rubbing the stomach of a pregnant woman without her consent in what is being called the first case of its kind. Richard J. Beishline, 57, went to his pregnant neighbor's trailer at about 5 p.m. on Oct. 20 in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania.. While there, Beishline allegedly hugged the woman and touched her stomach against her wishes. The woman pushed him away, police said. When Beishline left to return to his trailer, the woman reported him. Beishline was then charged with harassment in connection with the incident. 'Harassment': Richard J. Beishline, 57, seen here in a photo from Facebook, was reported to police for allegedly touching his pregnant neighbor inappropriately. It's the first known case of a controversial Pennsylvania law being applied . No touching: In Pennsylvania, a person can be charged with harassment for an action they take that has an intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person, such as rubbing the stomach of a pregnant woman . In the state of Pennsylvania, a person can be charged with harassment for an action they take that has an intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person. But rarely - if ever - has the law been applied to unwanted belly-touching and other physical contact aimed at pregnant women. 'It’s extremely rare and uncommon,' Pittsburgh attorney Phil DiLucente told NBC News. 'I have never heard or saw this ever being found.' 'This might be the first of its kind.' It is not known how far along in her pregnancy the woman was at the time. On his Facebook page, Beishline has listed himself as married. Plenty of women have weighed in on the controversial law. Jennifer Bosse, a mother of two and editor of the blog Defining My Happy, said it's a 'really tricky' situation . 'Elderly grandmother that exclaims excitedly and touches your belly for the briefest of moments? Maybe mildly annoying but not a crime. Scary woman or man that grabs at your belly and continues to jiggle you around long after the first no? Crime,' Bosse said. Richard J. Beishline is yet to respond to a harassment charge for allegedly feeling the stomach of his pregnant neighbor . Dani Mathes wrote on CNN's Facebook page: 'Annoying? Sure. Illegal? Heck no. We can't have laws for everything. We already complain about having so many laws for minor crap.' Twitter has been abuzz with the story today. 'If he doesn't know her well, then he should not touch her,' said the person behind the handle @lizturn585859 on Twitter. The charge is what is known as a summary offense in Pennsylvania, not a misdemeanor or a felony, and is typically disposed of with fines. After a person is charged, a citation is issued where the individual can plead guilty and pay a fine or plead not guilty and scheduled a hearing in district court. A magistrate in Cumberland County filed the harassment charge against Beishline. Beishline has not responded to the charge.","Richard Beishline, 57, was visiting a neighbor in her trailer in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania .

The company is offering the money while the investigation is ongoing so injured survivors have the money they need now - though all passengers will receive the $10,000 amount. Consolation: Asiana pledged to give the survivors of the flight that crash landed in San Francisco last month $10,000 in initial compensation . Victims: 181 of the over 300 people on the plane were injured in the landing - but all of the survivors will get the payment regardless of medical needs . 'This is a minimum payment we are offering for all passengers, regardless of whether they were injured or not,' she said. And accepting the money does not prevent survivors from being able to sue the company in the future. All the company is asking for is a receipt that the passengers accepted the payment. Lee said there would be no agreement attached to accepting the money. Already a group of 83 passengers has launched a lawsuit, but against plane's manufacturer Boeing, not Asiana. Though it could be expanded later to include the airline. Free to sue: The company said this payment will not prevent passengers from suing the airline in the future .

'God help me': Lisa Harnum (right) was allegedly heard screaming as she fought for her life on the balcony before she fell from the 15th floor of an apartment she shared with Gittany (left) in Sydney, Australia in 2011 .

Describing Gittany as 'controlling and abusive', Tedeschi said he made her become Catholic, do her hair and dress exactly how he told her.

The footage was captured on a pin-hole camera that he set up in the flat to spy on her . But his vice-like grip over her life was still not enough, the court heard. Mr Tedeschi told jurors Gittany even set up a network of mini cameras around the apartment to keep tabs on her and secretly read her emails and text messages. It was because of this forensic . campaign of surveillance that he caught wind of her plan to leave him . with the help of two friends, the court heard.

City officials say residents have been complaining of burning eyes, irritated throats and headaches and that some people have had to leave their house to escape the smell. Complaint: The city of Irwindale filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court Monday asking a judge to stop production at the Huy Fong Foods factory, claiming the chili odor emanating from the plant is a public nuisance . One family was forced to move a birthday party indoors after the strong smell overwhelmed the festivity, Irwindale City Attorney Fred Galante told the Los Angeles Times. The maker of Sriracha hot sauce is under fire for allegedly fouling the air around its Southern California factory . Huy Fong initially cooperated with the city, but talks broke down last week after company representatives denied there was an odor problem, saying their employees worked in similar olfactory settings without complaint, Mr Galante said. The city, which is about 20 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, is seeking temporary closure of the factory until Huy Fong submits a plan to minimize the smell. 'If they fix it and the odor problems stop, we don't need this order; but so far the odor complaints continue,' Mr Galante said. An after-hours call to the company was not immediately returned. Huy Fong's green-capped chili bottles are hugely popular and are a fixture at restaurants around the world. The first Sriracha Festival held in downtown Los Angeles over the weekend drew hundreds of fans. The condiment's creator, David Tran, was there sporting a T-shirt that said 'I put Sriracha on my Sriracha.' The company had operated out of two buildings in nearby Rosemead since the late 1980s until it opened large factory in Irwindale this year.

George Osborne’s plan to raise billions from a tax raid on secret Swiss bank accounts has been cast into doubt by the data watchdog. The nation’s finances had been boosted by the prediction that the Chancellor’s assault on tax dodgers would net an extra £3.2billion. But today the Office for National Statistics said there was now ‘significant doubt’ about how much the plan would secure, and slashed the amount brought in so far to just £342million. Missing millions: There are now serious doubts about whether a tax raid on Swiss bank accounts held by Brits will raise as much as George Osborne hoped . The government has staked both economic and political capital on clamping down on tax avoidance. In 2011 Mr Osborne signed a deal with the Swiss government to introduce a permanent tax for UK citizens with Swiss accounts. There was also a one-off payment imposed on May 31 this year to ‘clear past unpaid tax liabilities’. Mr Osborne received a major boost last month when the ONS said the levy had secured a £3.2billion windfall for the Treasury, narrowing government borrowing from £15.6billion in May 2012 to £12.7billion this year. However it now says there are major questions about whether the money will ever materialise. The Swiss Bankers Association revealed earlier this month that there were fewer untaxed British assets in accounts in Switzerland than previously thought. Now the ONS has said the uncertainty means it will only count the funds raised towards cutting the deficit once it materialises. It means that the £3.2billion figure pencilled in for May 2013 has now been slashed to only £342million. ‘The . recent announcement by the Swiss Bankers Association has cast . significant doubt regarding the amount that will finally be received,’ the ONS said. Blow: Chancellor George Osborne had hoped to secure £3.2billion from the tax levies . ‘This . suggests that a more cautious approach is now warranted and the payments . will be included as and when payments are received.’ But the Treasury said: 'We have always been clear that the one-off payments are just one part of the tax we expected to recover under the Swiss agreement. 'Some people will instead choose to disclose their account to HMRC and pay the tax due, rather than authorise the banks to make a deduction. 'We expect to raise further sums through these direct disclosures, and through those made through other channels such as the Liechtenstein Disclosure Facility.' The . warning came as figures showed the government was forced to borrow an . extra £500million last month in a blow to Mr Osborne's economic plans. Latest figures showed that public sector net borrowing - excluding distortions such as bank bailouts and quantitative easing - increased in June to £12.4 billion from £11.9 billion in 2012. Economists warned the jump in borrowing showed the nation's finances are still a ‘long way from health’ despite signs of a recovery gathering pace. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The Government is taking tough decisions to deal with the deficit: today's data shows that borrowing fell last year. ‘And while we can and will take nothing for granted, the economy is moving from rescue to recovery: the economy is growing; the deficit and unemployment are falling.’ The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), set up to monitor the state's finances, expects the deficit to come in at around £120 billion this financial year - which would mark an increase on 2012/13. Higher local government borrowing in June offset a 15.2 per cent increase in tax receipts from businesses and households to drive the underlying monthly deficit higher. But the ONS said figures are likely to be subject to revisions as more data is received from councils. The ONS revised the underlying deficit for the year to the end of March 2013 lower by £2.3 billion to £116.5 billion due to higher tax receipts. That meant the 2012/13 deficit was £2.1 billion lower than in 2011/12, reversing last month's £300 million upward revision to the annual result. James Knightley, economist at ING Bank, said while borrowing was ‘not quite as good as hoped for’, the numbers suggest the Government's full-year forecast remains on track. He added: ‘With economic activity starting to show some positive signs and with employment continuing to grow we would not be surprised to see the full year borrowing figure creeping below this forecast.’ But Martin Beck, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said the UK's public finances remain a ‘long way from health’. ‘While other indicators are pointing to signs of life in the UK economy, the public finances have yet to see much of a boost from the nascent upturn,’ he said. The OBR also warned over the Government's overstretched finances earlier this week, saying the UK's ageing population and strained healthcare system means an extra £19 billion of spending cuts or tax hikes are needed to combat ‘unsustainable’ pressure on its coffers.","Chancellor hoped tax and levies would raise billions to pay down deficit .

"By . Andrew Levy and Lucy Osborne . PUBLISHED: . 19:24 EST, 25 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:08 EST, 26 August 2013 . Rejected: Caroline Cieslewicz, 18, was not accepted by any British universities to study medicine despite A-grades . Straight-A students are being turned away from medicine degrees at British universities due to ‘bonkers’ government quotas, health experts have warned. The news comes as the NHS recruits foreign doctors in record numbers, many of whom have ‘little or no knowledge of British culture’. Quotas mean that top students are forced to study medicine abroad – and fund their own education – or choose another degree. For 2013-2014, English universities were allowed to recruit just 6,071 medicine students, even though the General Medical Council registers 13,000 doctors each year and the NHS struggles to recruit enough staff. An estimated 6,000 newly-registered doctors each year are foreigners who trained overseas. Experts have warned this practice puts lives at risk, because many of these doctors have poor English and are not always familiar with drugs used in this country. Despite these concerns, thousands of school-leavers who received their A-level results this month have been turned down for medicine. They include Caroline Cieslewicz, 18, who got straight As but was rejected by every university she applied to. Vanessa Bourne, former chairman of the Patients Association, said: ‘The situation is bonkers. The system needs a complete overhaul.’ Dr J Meirion Thomas, a leading London cancer surgeon, added: ‘The Government needs to take urgent action to help more students study medicine in the UK by increasing the number of places on courses. ‘Most applicants are rejected despite having the required grades. We encourage them to become doctors, then we slap them back for want of places. ‘Having to go abroad and fund their own studies is a massive disincentive and means many will choose other degrees instead. Until then, patients remain at risk from foreign doctors who have poor language skills and may not have been trained to our high standards.’ Medical emergency: Despite universities turning away British medical students, the NHS are taking in a record number of foreign doctors . Dr Thomas recently attacked the Government for limiting the number of ‘expensive’ places at British medical schools in an article for The Spectator. It costs around £250,000 to put a student through medical school. With A grades in maths and chemistry and an A* in biology, Caroline Cieslewicz seemed like the ideal medical student. But despite her stellar A-level results, the 18-year-old’s plans were dashed when she was turned down by four British universities. Despite having excellent grades – and work experience at a hospital, an optometrist practice and an overseas blood clinic – she was rejected outright by Cambridge, Bristol, Birmingham and Leicester. Caroline, who was head of her house at Rugby School, was also unsuccessful when she tried to find a place through clearing. She was, however, offered a place at Krakow University, after coming ninth out of more than 100 applicants in an entrance exam. Now her parents face the prospect of selling their home, near Northampton, to fund her studies in Poland. Fees for the six-year course will be £60,000 – and Caroline is unable to apply for a student loan, as she will be a foreign student. ‘It’s ridiculous. I don’t know what more I could have done,’ she said. ‘I didn’t expect all those rejections. ‘For the next six months my parents are going to see how they can finance my studies. ‘I feel bad because if I went to university here they wouldn’t have to help me.’ ‘I’m lucky because, although the course is in English, when you go into a clinical environment you need to speak Polish and I am fluent.’ Her father Conrad, a chartered surveyor who is married to Zofia, a chemistry and maths teacher, said: ‘Despite all she has achieved in life, she has been rejected to study in her native country.’ Those reading medicine in England pay tuition fees of up to £9,000 per year – the same as students of the majority of other subjects. However, medicine courses last five or six years, depending on the university. Students accepted on NHS-funded places are able to apply for means-tested bursaries to help fund their course, while all students are eligible for a non-means tested bursary of £1,000 in their fifth and sixth years. Dr Thomas wrote: ‘Most readers will be surprised to learn that every year, we import 40 per cent of our doctors because of insufficient training places in British medical schools. So, 40 per cent of doctors starting work in the NHS every year have little or no knowledge and experience of British culture or of our Health Service – and this in the most people-centric occupation of all. It really does matter.’ Universities’ medicine courses are vastly oversubscribed – but the Department of Health quotas block them from taking on more undergraduates. In one example, the University of Bristol had 4,000 applicants for its three medicine and surgery courses this year but just 232 places – enough for just one in 17. The University of Birmingham had 2,500 applicants but could accept only 334 undergraduates. The applicants to these two universities alone could have filled the entire country’s quota for the year. A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ‘We have worked hard to make sure that we have enough places in medical schools to become a self-sufficient Health Service. ‘There is a cap on the number of non-European Economic Area students that can attend medical education in England.’ A recent GMC survey found foreign-trained doctors were four times more likely to be suspended or struck off than those from the UK. David Gray, 70, died in 2009 after German locum Dr Daniel Ubani gave him ten times the normal does of diamorphine. Nigerian-born Ubani, who had had only a few hours’ sleep after flying over to the UK for his first shift, could barely speak English and was unfamiliar with the painkiller he used.","UK universities only accepts 6,000 medical students a year .

The novelist Somerset Maugham called the French Riviera a sunny place for shady people. On Sunday, one particularly shady customer dropped into Cannes — and swiftly high-tailed it out again £88million the richer. In a staggeringly brazen heist, the lone raider marched into the Carlton Cannes Hotel, the most glamorous hotel in the city. There, cool as ice, his face concealed by a motorcycle helmet, he threatened hotel staff with an automatic pistol before swiping a pile of diamonds and other gems from an exhibition in the lobby being held by Leviev Diamonds, one of the world’s top jewellers. Right under the noses of hotel security guards, the masked crook shovelled the jewels into a briefcase and then calmly strolled off down the Croisette — the seafront promenade where film stars, models and billionaires go to see and be seen. In recent years, the Croisette has also become a favoured haunt for the world’s most audacious diamond thieves. In May, during the annual Cannes Film Festival, £1million of jewellery was taken from the safe in the hotel room of an American jeweller working for Chopard, one of Switzerland’s most famous diamond merchants. Only days later, a £1.6million necklace was lifted by a crook at a film industry party just down the coast at the even more exclusive resort of Cap d’Antibes. The Carlton Cannes Hotel itself — the epicentre of Riviera glamour ever since it was built in 1911 — has proved a particularly irresistible target. In August 1994, three machine gun-toting crooks stormed into the hotel’s jewellery shop and cleared its shelves of £39million worth of gems. They have never been caught. Heist: The Carlton Cannes Hotel in the French Riviera resort of Cannes where the robbers struck on Sunday . But the raid this weekend was more outrageous still. First estimates put the value of the stolen jewellery at £35million. Now, following a detailed inventory of the missing jewels, the French police believe they may be worth as much as £88million. The robbery could have come straight out of a Hollywood heist movie — and, indeed, in an intriguing case of life imitating art, the Carlton Cannes was the setting for the 1955 Alfred Hitchcock movie To Catch A Thief. Cary Grant plays a suave, retired cat burglar suspected of stealing diamonds belonging to the millionaire mother of his gorgeous love interest, Grace Kelly. But that’s not the only Hollywood twist, for the chief suspects in the robbery are a gang known as the Pink Panthers, taking their nickname from the first Inspector Clouseau film about an international thief intent on stealing the world’s largest diamond — the eponymous Pink Panther. In the past, the gang — who have struck all over the world — have made provocative, teasing references to the film. After a 2002 raid on Graff’s, a Mayfair jeweller, one gang member, Milan Jovetic from Montenegro, hid a £500,000 blue diamond ring in his girlfriend’s jar of face cream — a ploy used in the Pink Panther comedy. But there was nothing funny about the attack. During the raid, Jovetic’s accomplice brandished a loaded Magnum .357 revolver, and the gang stole £23million worth of jewellery — only £3million of which has been recovered. In May 2005, Graff’s was attacked a second time — again, it is thought, by the Pink Panthers. This time, £1million of gems were taken. Only last Thursday, one of the Pink Panther ringleaders, a 34-year-old Bosnian, Milan Poparic, broke out of a Swiss prison. He had been serving a six-year sentence for another diamond robbery in Neuchatel, Switzerland, in 2009. During last week’s jailbreak, a group . of his accomplices battered their way into Orbe prison by driving a van, . pedal to the floor, through the front gate. They . then kept prison guards at bay with a hail of automatic gunfire from . their AK-47 assault rifles, as Poparic and another man — a Swiss . kidnapper called Adrian Albrecht — scaled the prison walls and jumped . into a waiting van, which sped off. Investigation: Police cars are parked outside the Carlton Hotel on Sunday after one particularly shady customer dropped in - and swiftly high-tailed it out again £88 million the richer . As if this wasn’t embarrassing enough for the Swiss authorities, Albrecht had escaped from the same jail before, in 1992. And only in May this year, a third member of the Pink Panther gang escaped from the Bois-Mermet prison in the Swiss town of Lausanne. The suspicion is that Poparic, reunited with his old partners in crime, then co-ordinated Sunday’s raid in Cannes. He had plenty of partners to choose from. For the Pink Panthers are a loose affiliation of up to 200 thieves, many of them ex-soldiers from the former Yugoslavia, hardened by the Balkan wars. The group is thought to have been . involved with burglaries worth more than £380million across 120 . jewellery shops in more than 20 countries, from the U.S. to Switzerland, . and Dubai to Spain. Police suspect the Pink Panthers of . everything from drug-trafficking to murder — but what the gang . especially like is old-fashioned jewel theft . Police suspect the Pink Panthers of everything from drug-trafficking to murder — but what the gang especially like is old-fashioned jewel theft. The techniques used in their raids are straightforward: not much more than a classic smash-and-grab. But they like to spice up  their crimes with a dash of movie heist daring. In one raid in Biarritz, on the western coast of France, they  gave a public bench near their target jewellery shop a fresh coat  of paint to stop any passers-by  sitting there and becoming accidental witnesses. In 2007, during a raid on a shop in Ginza, a high-end shopping district in Tokyo, suspected members of the gang stole a £1.5million diamond tiara. After spraying three saleswomen with tear gas — temporarily blinding but not otherwise harming them — they helped themselves to a tiara, necklaces and other gems. Security footage showed the gang members calmly walking into the store dressed in slim-fitting suits and crisply ironed white shirts. One even carried an umbrella. They were in and out of the shop in just 36 seconds and made their getaway on bicycles, weaving in and out of the heavy traffic. Police: Right under the noses of hotel security guards, the masked crook shovelled the jewels into a briefcase and then calmly strolled off down the Croisette - the seafront promenade where stars go to see and be seen . They used another novel mode of getaway transport in 2005 in St Tropez, where the gang raided a jewellery store before making their escape in a speedboat. They wore masks over their faces and garish, floral-print Hawaiian shirts. When they attacked a branch of the jewellers Graff’s — a favourite target — in Dubai in 2008, they smashed their way into the glazed front of the shop in two limousines, before making off with jewellery worth £8million. And like any Hollywood criminals, the Panthers like their disguises. In 2008, they dressed up as women for an attack on jeweller’s Harry Winston in Paris. They wore blonde wigs, sunglasses and fashionable scarves — but carried concealed hand grenades and .357 Magnum guns. They left with emeralds, rubies and diamonds worth nearly £70 million. For a 2009 raid on Graff’s in Bond . Street, it is thought they used the latest in prosthetic make-up.  This . time they got away with £40million of jewels. It would be utterly wrong to romanticise . the Pink Panthers, who are known for their ruthless pursuit of wealth, . carrying out raids armed with Kalashnikovs . But it would be utterly wrong to romanticise the Pink Panthers, who are known for their ruthless pursuit of wealth, carrying out raids armed with Kalashnikovs. In 2005, a shop assistant at a jeweller's in Vienna was shot in the face during a robbery attributed to the Pink Panthers. Rarely are the jewels recovered. Necklaces, tiaras and bracelets are broken up, their gold or platinum settings melted down, and individual gems sold in plain sight on the international diamond market. Arresting the perpetrators has proved easier than tracking down the stolen jewels. And the burglaries continue despite the arrests. In 2007, three gang members were convicted of taking part in Japan’s biggest ever jewel robbery, when £15million in merchandise was stolen, including the Comtesse de Vendome necklace of 116 diamonds, with its centrepiece 125-carat diamond. Three more Panthers were convicted in 2008 for robberies across France. Others have been arrested in Cyprus, Monaco, Rome and Athens, where three Serbs were spotted in March 2012 casing a jewellery shop, disguised with wigs. One of them has already escaped from Athens prison. But the organisation is seemingly unstoppable. Cut off one head of this hydra-like gang and another two or three grow in its place. For anxious jewellers, keeping an eye on their diamond necklaces, the terrifying truth is that there are so many Pink Panthers, and they are so adept at breaking out of jail, that even a whole pack of Inspector Clouseaus — however accidentally brilliant — could never hope to round them all up.","Lone raider stole £88m of jewels from Carlton Cannes Hotel on Sunday .

A lone robber brandishing a handgun yesterday stole jewels worth £34million in a brazen heist in the most glamorous hotel on the French Riviera. He tipped diamonds and other precious stones into a briefcase during the raid in broad daylight at the Carlton in Cannes, a favourite haunt of Hollywood’s biggest film stars. The robber made off on foot through the exclusive Promenade de la Croisette which stretches a mile and a half along the Cannes seafront and is thronged by the rich and famous throughout the year. Scroll down for video . Raid: A police car is seen outside the Carlton hotel, in Cannes, today after thieves fled with £35million worth of jewellery . In a bitter irony, the Carlton is the setting for Alfred Hitchcock’s 1955 film To Catch A Thief, a romantic thriller starring Grace Kelly and Cary Grant about a jewel thief operating in the Riviera. One expert noted that the crime followed recent jail escapes by members of the notorious Pink Panther jewel thief gang. On Thursday, Milan Poparic escaped his Swiss prison after accomplices rammed a gate and overpowered guards with bursts from their AK-47s. He is the third member of the gang to escape from a Swiss prison in as many months. According to Interpol, the Pink Panthers targeted luxury watch and jewellery stores in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the United States, netting more than £380million. Jonathan Sazonoff, the US editor of the Museum Security Network website, said: ‘The brazen drama of it is their style. The possibility of the re-emergence of the Pink Panther gang is very troubling and taken seriously by law enforcement worldwide. They’re a crime wave waiting to happen.’ The jewels belonged to London-based Israeli billionaire Lev Leviev, who was holding an exhibition of the prestigious Leviev diamond house in the hotel lobby over the summer. Heist: The jewellery was at a temporary exhibition at the Carlton which was being organised by Leviev . A source at the hotel said: ‘The raid took place in broad daylight when there were hundreds of holidaymakers enjoying the sunshine. It could not have been more audacious. The thief took advantage of the crowds and the relaxed Sunday atmosphere – he could easily have had others working with him.’ A Cannes police spokesman said: ‘A full and urgent operation is under way to catch the culprit and recover these jewels.’ Organised gangs frequently target boutiques and hotels in and around Cannes. Many of the raids turn out to be inside jobs, with staff helping thieves to locate and then steal items. In May, jewellery worth £1million was stolen from a hotel safe during the annual Cannes Film Festival. An unnamed American woman working for Chopard, the Swiss jeweller and festival sponsor, was keeping the items in her second-floor room at the Cannes Novotel. Chopard had 40 staff at Cannes who tried to persuade stars to wear its products. Julianne Moore, Cindy Crawford and Cara Delevingne were all seen wearing Chopard pieces this year.A few days later a necklace worth £1.6million vanished after a festival party in the neighbouring resort town of Cap d’Antibes. The 343-room InterContinental Carlton is a favourite of the stars, and is considered the ‘celebrity HQ’ during the film festival. In August 1994, three men firing machine guns burst into the Carlton and robbed its jewellery store. Later, it was discovered the gang were firing blanks. There have been several high-profile jewellery thefts in Europe this year, including one at Brussels airport in February which saw £32million worth of diamonds taken. French Rivera: The Carlton hotel which was targeted by raiders is on the seafront in Cannes . The biggest-ever diamond heist was at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam in 2005. Dressed in stolen uniforms belonging to the Dutch airline KLM and driving a stolen KLM van, thieves hijacked an armoured truck containing uncut diamonds worth an estimated £50million. They have never been recovered. Russian-Israeli Mr Leviev, 57, lives in a £35million home in Hampstead, North-West London. The father-of-nine started his jewellery business in a boutique in London’s Old Bond Street in 2006, and the Leviev house now runs upmarket stores in cities including New York and Dubai. The film To Catch a Thief stars Grant as a former cat burglar struggling to save his reformed reputation by catching a new thief preying on the wealthy tourists of the French Riviera.","Thief pointed handgun at staff in the Carlton during raid this afternoon .

A British family are being forced to sell their house after Italian authorities seized their £250,000 holiday home illegally built on agricultural land. Brendan and Jane Crossan fell in love with the Ligurian Riviera and in 2006 bought a cottage where they planned to spend school and university holidays with their three boys. But seven years later, the perfect property deal has become a holiday home from hell, after authorities seized the villa. Dream holiday home from hell: Brendan and Jane Crossan fell in love with the Ligurian Riviera and in 2006 bought a cottage where they planned to spend school and university holidays with their three boys . The couple from Ashtead, Surrey, have also been charged with owning an illegal property- a criminal offence that carries in Italy a penalty of two years in prison or a 50,000 (£42,000) euro fine. After a five-year legal battle, police yesterday sequestered their cottage, overlooking the pretty medieval village of Dolcedo, giving the family just sixty days to remove their possessions and get out. To make matters much worse Brendan, a social housing director, 52, and Jane, an NHS nursing manager, 48, will be forced to sell their home in the UK as well, as they will no longer be able to pay off the mortgage as planned. Charged: The couple from Ashtead, Surrey, have also been charged with owning an illegal property- a criminal offence that carries in Italy a penalty of two years in prison or a Euro 50,000 fine . They had invested their entire endowment, which was to pay off the remainder of their mortgage when they retired, in the second home. The couple have also had to take out a second mortgage on the UK home to pay almost £20,000 in legal fees . In a cruel irony, at the time of purchase, the family were featured in the travel section of a British newspaper advising others to buy second homes in Italy instead of France where prices are much higher. Order: After a five-year legal battle, police yesterday sequestered their cottage, overlooking the pretty medieval village of Dolcedo, giving the family just sixty days to remove their possessions and get out . The nursing manager, who works for Sutton and Merton Community Services, said they had no qualms about buying in Italy.She said: ‘From the moment we stood on that terrace and looked out we knew it was the one. It was the views, the house, the position, everything. We looked at each other and thought -this is it.’‘We weren’t worried about buying abroad. We’d seen “Holidays from Hell” and stuff but we thought that was just Spain.’ After the purchase, the Crossans integrated into the village community, making friends and learning Italian.

Their three sons, Dan, 25, Tom, 23 and Paddy, 10, loved coming there for cycling, days on the beach, and the area’s famous Pasta alla Pesto. But two years later, at Christmas-time 2008, the couple received an email from the previous owners, advising them to get a lawyer immediately. The house was one of 81 properties in the area that had been built on designated agricultural land. Many of them were second home belonging to foreigners. All had been given planning permission by the council, which had now been revoked by the regional government. ‘It’s all so terribly unfair. We weren’t the people who built the house- we bought it in good faith' Brenda Crossan . Mrs Crossan said: ‘It’s all so terribly unfair. We weren’t the people who built the house- we bought it in good faith. ‘When I watch things like this on television you think “How could they let this happen? Why didn’t they do things properly?” But we did everything properly.’ The NHS manager said she ‘still loves Italy’. She said: ‘It’s like unrequited love when you’ve been finished with by a boyfriend.’ But her husband countered: ‘Given the choice, I would sell the house and never come back.’ The experience has caused the couple enormous stress. Most crushing were the criminal charges for which the experienced nurse had to fly over especially. She said: ‘When I was served the papers I felt like I was having a heart attack. I had palpitations. I couldn’t breathe. I felt as if my hearing was going and that I was going to faint.’ She added: ‘I felt as if I was in a documentary that I didn’t want to be in.’ The couple now have ten days to appeal to Italy’s highest court. If the appeal fails the house is likely to be demolished within months. They are the only Brits involved although there are many other foreigners. Four notaries who signed the original documents have been placed under investigation. But incredibly, the mayor and council committee of Dolcedo who authorised the building are not facing charges, as the statute of limitations has run out for that offence. Those affected have organised several protests. Organiser Barbara Gibellini, who stands to lose her only home, said: 'The worst thing is that the ones that pay are the ones who are victims of the situation. We are not guilty. We haven't done anything.' 'All of us that have bought these houses have bought them on land which has not been cultivated for years, abandoned land. We have all planted things. I have 15 olive trees from which I make oil.'","Brendan and Jane Crossan bought the villa in Ligurian Rivierad in 2006 .

One of the most memorable images of the year must be the delighted face of the Queen as her horse Sign Manual raced to victory at Newbury just before her 87th birthday in April. If nothing stirs your blood like the stampeding of thoroughbred hooves down the flat and crowds cheering as the winner takes the final fence, this is surely the ideal living location. A new housing development - with a deferential nod to tradition - makes Newbury the first racecourse in Britain to develop its extensive grounds for housing. It includes luxury, grandstand-style apartments with a direct view along the famous straight mile. GRANDSTAND DESIGN: Helen and Lucy love their racecourse home . The first recorded racing at Newbury was in 1805, but the racecourse itself wasn't constructed until almost a century later, in 1904. A century  on, it's the Queen's favourite, and she visits it every year for her birthday. The historic nature of the Berkshire town, and the Royal connection, made it imperative that the new housing development, called Living At The Racecourse, was built in as sympathetic a style as possible. A joint development between David Wilson Homes and the racecourse itself, it's part of a plan to redevelop the venue and the surrounding area. In total, 1,500 new homes are being built in 300 acres of the grounds. The first phase of the accommodation is now available in the form  of more than 400 townhouses and apartments. The houses are built in elegant red-brick crescents near the entrance to the racecourse and set among majestic and mature oak trees. Prices range from £295,000 to £458,000. The first occupant, solicitor and racing fan Helen Childs, was initially attracted to the development by its proximity to the racecourse. SAFE BET: Newbury Racecourse is breaking new ground with a 1,500-home development . But when she looked around the 1,875 sq ft, five-bedroom, three-bathroom house with her children Lucy, 11, and Joe, 14, she realised  that the location and layout made  it ideal for a family with slightly  older children. They moved in three months ago. 'Joe has the whole of the top floor with a bedroom and his own bathroom,' she says. The other spare room on that floor is for her father, who visits every weekend from Northamptonshire. 'He is a big fan of racing, and delighted we have moved,' says Helen. The Queen celebrates her Newbury win . Lucy, meanwhile, says her bedroom is like a hotel room. The house has a front-facing reading room on the first floor with a vast window running the length of the wall, and a small balcony. This can be used as a second sitting room, a spare room or - as here - a bedroom for a very fortunate daughter. The bright and warm kitchen, with integrated appliances, opens on to the garden. 'That's what finally sold it to me,' says Helen. 'It gets the evening sun, and the outside flows in. It's like living between town and countryside.

Protect your best assets: Look after your cleavage and it could stay as perky as Eva Herzigova's . Earlier this week it was reported that breast tissue ages around three years faster than any other part of the body. While there's not a lot you can do about this internal ageing, there is something you can do about outer signs such as crepey skin, sun spots, sagging and wrinkles. So, what are the best ways to halt - or even reverse - these visible signs, and make sure your best assets grow old as gracefully as the rest of you? Would you spend £75 on a cleavage facial? No, this is not a joke: at London’s Ark salons (arkskincare.com) you can have a Cleavage Skin Response Facial that combines exfoliation and oils with masks and massage to firm, hydrate and nourish the skin. If you would rather pamper yourself in private, you could even invest in 24k gold collagen breast masks (£52, jamelaskincare.co.uk). They come in a pack of ten and look rather like golden flowers with the centre cut out. Simply slip them into place and, claim the manufacturers, the combination of gold and plant collagen will help to increase cellular metabolism and tighten the skin, making it feel smoother and firmer. Cosmetic dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting recommends rather more conventional treatments, but she agrees that the skin of the decollete tends to be mistreated. 'The skin here is thin, often exposed to sunlight, but frequently forgotten about when it comes to daily protection from UV rays,' she says. 'The result is blotchy pigmentation, crepey texture due to loss of elasticity and broken capillaries.' Smoking can also take its toll on your decolletage, with some experts claiming that you can tell whether a woman is a smoker simply by the wrinkles on her chest. Dr Bunting recommends using the same products that you'd use to rejuvenate your face to anti-age the skin below your neck. Golden wonders? Collagen breast masks . 'I tell my patients they should be applying their skincare right down to their chest - and that means using a broad-spectrum sunscreen every single day, not just on holiday.' If the damage is already done, forget cleavage facials and masks, there are three key ingredients you should be keeping an eye out for: 'Vitamin C is a fantastic ingredient for the decollete as it builds collagen [which plumps the skin] and helps prevent and treat pigmentation,' says Dr Bunting. Find it in Nubo's SynErgetic Serum Visage Decollete (£45, nubobeauty.com). Vitamin B3 (or niacinamide), as found in Dr Nick Lowe The Secret Is Out Neck & Decollete Cream SPF15 (£29.99, boots.com), is also valuable. Finally, vitamin A (retinol and retinaldehyde) will help repair the sun damage. But beware, Dr Bunting warns it can be an irritant, so start with a low concentration product such as Replenish Neck and Decolletage Cream (£15.95, nurtureskincare.co.uk). The position you sleep in could age your breasts . 'Your sleeping position can predispose you to wrinkling on the chest,' says Dr Bunting. 'Lying on your side can cause vertical lines in the cleavage, particularly in those who have larger breasts - and if the skin becomes sun-damaged, the creases may become fixed.' According to the experts, anything comfortable enough to snooze in is unlikely to be supportive enough to stop gravity taking a visible toll: 'The only bra that we'd recommend you sleep in would be a soft cup bra, but that wouldn't separate the breasts,' says Charlotte Elliston of lingerie experts, Rigby & Peller. Sleeping on your back will help to avoid wrinkling the delicate skin between your breasts, but if you find yourself waking up on your side, despite your best efforts, a Kush (£29.99, thekushcompany.com) might be the answer. An anatomically-countoured, non-slip cylinder, it sits between the breasts at night so they stay separated when you're on your side. The idea is that it works like a small cushion, preventing the upper breast from sinking in to the lower breast and stretching the skin with it. Working along similar lines is the La Decollette Anti-Wrinkle Bra (£42.95, decollette.co.uk) which looks like no bra you've ever seen. Rather than having cups that cover the breasts, it just has a cushioned section that sits in between them. Research shows that this unconventional underwear could decrease the appearance of 'cleavage crinkle' after just one night's use. 'The problem with breasts is that while they're subject to the same anti-agers as the rest of your body - such as sunlight and smoking - unlike anywhere else in the body, they are effectively two weights that are supported only by skin,' says Patrick Mallucci of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. Gravity can be tough enough on your decolletage when you're just out and about - research from the University of Portsmouth shows that even when you're walking, breasts move around up to 33 per cent from their standing position - but when you run, it’s another story altogether. 'Wearing a specific bra for exercise is crucial,' says Charlotte Elliston of Rigby & Peller. 'Breast movement during sporting activity can definitely contribute to loss of tone, sagging and stretch marks. But a good sports bra can restrict up to 80 per cent of that movement.' Although all the exercise in the world won't increase your cup size, working the pectoral muscles that support the chest can make things look an awful lot perkier. Don't bother with any Barbara Windsor-style arm flinging - instead, try press-ups or, if you're in the gym, chest presses. Support: Wearing a good sports bra when exercising will prevent breast tissue from stretching and sagging . 'Women come into my office and tell me that their children have ruined their bodies. Unfortunately, they’re right,' says plastic surgeon Miles Berry who is co-author of The Good Boob Bible. 'The high levels of oestrogen produced towards the end of pregnancy causes the ligaments to stretch,' he explains. 'Although they will shrink back, they won't go back to where they were before and there's not much you can do about that - except surgery.' You don't have to go under the scalpel, however. There is a wide range of pretty effective options that rely on syringes and lasers to get rid of sagging, wrinkles and age spots. 'Many of the treatments that have been successfully used to rejuvenate the face can also be used effectively on the decollete,' says Lorna Jackson, editor of consulting room.com, a website that provides independent information about aesthetic treatments. 'Laser treatment (from £100) remains a good option for zapping the dark spots that are the legacy of sun worshipping, and chemical peels can also work well.' Platelet Rich Plasma (from about £350) - also known as Dracula Therapy or Vampire Therapy because it involves drawing blood from the patient, separating out the platelets and reinjecting them into the skin - has become a popular form of skin rejuvenation and has been used successfully on the decollete, as well as the face. One of the latest treatments - fat nanografting - involves harvesting fat from the patient, usually from their buttocks or stomach, then breaking it down into tiny particles that can be injected into the face or decollete. 'It's not simply about adding volume: when you inject fat, lines are smoothed and you get a glow that wasn't there before,' says plastic surgeon, Patrick Mallucci. 'We think that’s down to the stem cells you find in it - it gives skin its sparkle back.'","Cleavage 'facials' are available .

Germany's central bank has warned of a housing boom in the country with soaring property prices in the country 'difficult to justify'. According to Bundesbank, a surge of foreign investment has seen housing in some of the economic powerhouse's major cities overvalued by as much as 20 per cent. In a monthly report, the country's top financial institution fired a warning that price rises for apartments and flats in the major cities, did not stand up to valuations based on basic methods. In demand: Properties such as these in Kreuzberg, Berlin are said to be popular with foreign investors . The statement will serve to ramp up concern of a real estate boom in Germany. In popular cities such as Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, Cologne, Frankfurt and Stuttgart, the price of apartments and flats had risen by 25 per cent on average since 2010. The report reads: 'Over the past three years, the prices for houses and apartments (nationally) have risen by a total of 8.25 percent.' The report said that the increase could 'give rise to fears of a broad-based property price boom'. The bank said that property prices were driven up by an increase in demand for German property, caused by slumps in other countries during the economic downturn. It also said that housing had become seen as a more reliable than other forms of investment. But whereas Asian cities such as Singapore and Hong Kong have put legislation in place to tax foreign buyers in a bid to maintain stability in their housing market, Germany have welcomed investment. Depsite the fears of a 'bubble' however, Bundesbank believes that it is very unlikely that higher property prices will lead to financial instability. Steady: The strength German economy under Angela Merkel has been a big pull for property investors . The conditions placed on mortgages in Germany are much tougher than in the U.S. and other parts of Europe,  meaning that banks and other lenders would probably not be severely affected by a mini bust. Carsten Brzeski, a senior economist at ING, said that despite the beginnings of regional exaggerations, a bubble does not seem to be in the offing in Germany. He said: 'There are no reasons, yet, to call the latest developments the start of a typical bubble as experienced in other countries before. 'Mortgage growth has remained limited, loan-to-value ratios in Germany have been stable at around 80 percent and the large majority of Germans still prefer mortgages with fixed - rather than variable - rates. 'Even if the Bundesbank's assessment of a fundamental overvaluation looks justified, prices, at least in urban areas, could, in the short run, still further increase on the back of low interest rates and limited supply.'","Investors have flocked to Germany because of strong economy .

A student has sparked outrage by declaring his intentions to lose his virginity in front of a crowd - in the name of art. Clayton Pettet, 19, is to have gay sex for the first time in a gallery full of spectators for his 'Art School Stole My Virginity' project. Mr Pettet, who has not yet told his parents about his plan, believes the 'performance art project' will earn him rave reviews for challenging the idea of sexuality. Artist Clayton Pettet is planning to lose his virginity in front of a crowd of people for an art project . The performance is set to take place in front of 50-100 people in a space in Hackney, East London. Mr Pettet and a friend will engage in safe sex and then ask the audience what they made of the performance. But the second-year student at Central Saint Martins art school has been accused of cheapening sex and art. He has been planning the event, which is set to take place on January 25, for three years. Mr Pettet said: 'The key thing about performance art is that it should only be performed once, and this is the ultimate once-in-a-lifetime performance. 'I've held on to my virginity for 19 years, and I'm not throwing it away lightly. Basically it's like I am losing the stigma around virginity. 'I want the audience to see if anything has changed between me and my partner. 'Since culturally we do hold quite a lot of value to the idea of virginity I have decided to use mine and the loss of it to create a piece that I think will stimulate interesting debate and questions regarding the subject.'

A jilted lover shot dead his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend on Sunday before turning the gun on himself. Marie Hartman, 26, and firefighter Andrew Hoffman, 27, were killed at his Baltimore home in the early hours of Sunday by police officer Christopher Robinson who then took his own life. Miss Hartman's teenage sister Brittany told police that she hid in the closet while she listened to the gunshots before fleeing. Scroll down for video . Marie Hartman (pictured left) and her boyfriend Andrew Hoffman were killed at his Baltimore home on Sunday morning . Shocked relatives and friends gathered to mourn the couple following the tragic murder-suicide . The three had returned to Mr Hoffman's home around 1.30am after going to a Halloween party and picking up fast food. Police believe that Robinson followed them and then went to Mr Hoffman's door. When the firefighter confronted the police officer, he was shot. Brittany, 18, told police she heard screaming and more gunshots from her hiding place in a closet. She then climbed out of a window to escape. Police found the bodies of the two men and woman at the home. Miss Hartman was mother to a six-year-old son. Relatives and friends struggled to come to terms with the shocking deaths as they held a vigil for the couple on Sunday night. Police officer Christopher Lee Robinson is believed to be responsible for the shootings . Fred Scheper, 29, spoke of Mr Hoffman, telling the Baltimore Sun: 'That was my best friend. He saved people's lives every day.' Mr Scheper said that he had never seen his friend as happy as in his relationship with Miss Hartman. The family of Mr Hoffman, a third-generation firefighter, released this statement: 'Our hearts are absolutely broken over the loss of our son, brother, grandson and uncle. Our beloved Andy dedicated his life to protecting and saving others with the Baltimore City Fire Department as a Firefighter/Paramedic. We have come to learn that he died doing the same thing, putting others first. 'The only survivor of this horrific tragedy told us Andy tried to protect her and Marie, and because of that, he became the first victim. 'We have lost someone who meant so much to us and so many family members and friends. It’s hard to imagine going forward without him, but we know Andy died a hero. That is the way he lived his life and we couldn’t be prouder of him.' Wayne Robinson, brother of the alleged shooter, said that the 37-year-old had been struggling to cope with his break-up from Miss Hartman in August. However he said that he had no idea that he would become violent. Wayne Robinson, a firefighter who was also a friend of victim Mr Hoffman, told the Sun: 'I don't know what happened last night, but the person that pulled that trigger wasn't the Chris that I know.' Close family members and friends posted tributes to Robinson on his page on Sunday. His mother Marian Moore-Robinson wrote: 'Chris was a great guy! What got him to go over there - we may never know. He had been out on a date, and was texting his ex-wife till midnight. I just don't understand. Three families are now broken. Why?' Robinson, a Marines Corp veteran from Abingdon, went to the home at 1.30am on Sunday and shot the couple before killing himself, according to a police spokesman. Miss Hartman's stepfather Ed Chaney told the Sun that she had dated the police officer on and off over the past year. Mr Chaney said his stepdaughter had been receiving text messages from her ex-boyfriend pleading for her to give their relationship another chance. Wayne Robinson said his brother became aware a few weeks ago that Miss Hartman was dating the firefighter.

A Falklands veteran killed himself by crashing a plane into a cliff-face as he struggled with leaving the Royal Navy and splitting from his wife. Retired Royal Navy lieutenant commander Andrew Stillwell-Cox, 55, hired a light aircraft from his flying club for a solo flight, an inquest heard. As two friends waited for him at the airfield, he turned off-course and deliberately crashed, dying instantly. Retired Royal Navy lieutenant commander Andrew Stillwell-Cox deliberately crashed into a cliff-face . An inquest heard that Mr Stillwell-Cox took his own life after he struggled with leaving the Royal Navy . He nosedived on to beauty spot Sheep Rock just north of RAF Portreath, Cornwall, on July 21 last year. Horrified onlookers saw him circling at an altitude of around 500ft before his blue Cessna C172 M slammed into the ground and exploded on impact. An inquest heard Mr Stillwell-Cox, who was twice awarded the Sword of Honour, had struggled to cope after retiring as first lieutenant from RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall in 2007. A letter left on the dashboard of his friend and flying partner’s car described his difficulties at coming to terms with life as a civilian and a recent split from his second wife Ellie. He also left his car and house keys and police found a note addressed to his estranged wife at his home in Retallick Meadows, St Austell. The Truro inquest heard how Mr Stillwell-Cox had made one previous attempt to take his life a few weeks earlier by trying to gas himself in his car. He was taken to A&E but his risk of potential suicide was recorded as low. Pictures taken outside today's inquest in Truro, Cornwall, of Mr Stillwell-Cox's second wife (left), his brother (left in right picture) and his son (right) Mr Stillwell-Cox, who had two adults sons, met his second wife while working at RNAS Culdrose in 2004. The couple moved in together in 2006. She told the inquest in a statement: 'Andrew lived for the Navy and found it difficult to live in civilian life. Flying was his distraction and his way of living without the Navy. 'I loved Andrew a lot and was happy in our marriage. He was very generous but found it difficult to show affection. 'When I found out I wasn’t entirely surprised as he had told me people couldn’t watch him 24/7 and couldn’t bear not being in the navy. 'Andrew died doing something he loved.' Mr Stillwell-Cox with his dog, Archie . The inquest heard that he left a letter to close friend David Spencer Evans who was at the airfield. It read: 'Ellie has systematically destroyed me and has brought me to my knees. I know that I’m unable to continue my journey alone. 'I dread another day without Ellie by my side. I loved Ellie with all my heart.' The letter found addressed to Ellie at his home ended: 'Please think kindly of me and remind yourself that you did once love me.' Cornwall Coroner Emma Carlyon heard that Andrew had suffered post-traumatic and depression following his retirement. He received counselling after a traumatic experience while serving in the Falklands where he saw a number of his friends die in front of him. Mr Stillwell-Cox, who was twice awarded the Sword of Honour, had struggled to cope after retiring as first lieutenant from RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall . Mr Spencer Evans said: 'It was a tremendous amount to deal with. Andrew put on a brave face. 'He was greatly respected and very much admired, that’s the man he was. 'Everything he did, he did it meticulously.' He added: 'I have no doubt at all that Andrew had not intended to come back.' Andrew took off on his final flight without his flying suit or lucky gloves which David said he found strange. Police later said this was significant as the gloves and suit are flame retardant, .

While the Tommies were in the trenches fighting the Kaiser, the womenfolk of Britain were back home toiling to keep the country functioning. Well, most of them were. Others, it seems, spent the First World War down the pub, taking advantage of certain freedoms that came with the fact most of the nation’s young men had been sent away to the front line. Moral outrage was sparked by an ‘army of women’ filling Britain’s public houses, leading to demands for Government action to keep them at home. 'The army of women crowding public-houses': The Manchester Evening News reports the hoards of women who took to drinking in pubs during WWI . By trawling local newspaper archives, the family history website Genes Reunited found the problem cropping up all over the country, as indignation spread at the sight of women carousing in alehouses. Some were even compared to prostitutes as newspapers reported calls for ‘drastic’ action. Men who stayed in Britain and worked long hours found pubs had even run out of supplies by the time the ladies had finished at the bar. One disgruntled worker wrote to the Liverpool Echo in February 1918 about the ‘army of women crowding the public houses’. He complained: ‘The amount of liquor drunk by women on licensed premises is abnormal, and it is a fact that men returning from work at 9pm are often unable to obtain any refreshment.’ He suggested landlords should keep aside ‘a small surplus of supplies for their male customers who are “doing their bit” working late at night’. Similar grievances were aired in Hull, while in Dundee there were calls for the Sheriff to take action to ‘lessen the evil’. 'An excessive amount of drinking' was reported in Dundee, prompting the Sheriff to take action against the situation which 'demanded drastic treatment' Having control of money seems to have enabled women to socialise more. In 1914, the Aberdeen Journal reported: ‘Having more money than usual, there were only too many [people] ready to help them to spend it in the wrong way.’ In 1916, the matter was debated by Bootle Licensing Magistrates, one of whom, Captain Oversby, said: ‘The great increase in the number of women visiting public-houses during the past year has demanded drastic treatment.’ The licensing magistrates proposed refurbishing all public houses, to do away with ‘partitions, snugs and other obstacles likely to facilitate secret drinking’. In 1915, the Manchester Evening News reported a member of the county magistrates, Mr Theophilus Simpson, had been shocked to count ‘26 women enter a licensed house in ten minutes, with 16 coming out who he had not seen enter’. The United Free Church Presbytery found that the women 'were given to excess before', reports the Manchester Evening News, while a female writer tries to explain the 'toiling' of women in the working classes in another newspaper article . He likened this behaviour to that of a prostitute, remarking: ‘Some people said women have a right to spend their money as they liked; they might as well say they had a right to sell themselves if they like.’ Rhoda Breakell, of Genes Reunited. said: 'Despite the negative press, women continued to enjoy themselves in the pubs. ‘These were stressful times but the war also gave women more freedoms, because a lot of the men were away and they had greater control over the family finances. 'Our researchers found that all over Britain there were concerns about the amount of women drinking in pubs.'","Newspaper archives show growing concern over soldiers' wives who took over pubs during WWI .

Witnesses have described watching the green-tinged ‘fireball’ shoot over England and Wales in a northerly direction at around 9.45pm on Wednesday. Some observers were convinced it was a UFO, and thousands took to twitter to find out what was happening. Scroll down for video . Grabs, taken from CCTV footage in Cardiff, show what appears to be a large meteor flashing across the night sky. The meteor is the small dot seen at the top of the image, in the centre. The meteor looks like a blue and green light and was spotted with a tail behind it moving quickly in the sky on Wednesday. There were also reported sightings in Cornwall, Lancashire, Wales and Worcestershire . The technical name for Halley’s Comet's is Comet 1P/Halley. A comet is an small body of ice that travels through our solar system. Halley's Comet orbits the Sun once every 75 years or so. It can travel close to Neptune and Venue on its orbit around the Sun. As it gets close to the Sun, the ice it is made of turns into gas, which creates a tail. The comet also drops debris including dust and gravel as it orbits. When this debris enters the Earth's atmosphere it begins to burn quickly and brightly and this is what  experts think Wednesday night's meteor was caused by. Experts believe the meteor might have formed from debris from Halley's Comet. Sightings were recorded in Cornwall, Hampshire, Lancashire, South Wales and Worcestershire. Louise Darnell also reported the unusual event on the social networking site. She wrote: ‘Seen the brightest and lowest shooting star ever! It was definitely a UFO..??’ Virtual Astronomer tweeted a picture of the ‘fireball’ taken over Wiltshire. The meteor was captured by cameras from the UK Meteor Network. The left picture was shot by a camera in Clanfield. The right picture shows the meteor over Ash Vale South . Many of the UK Meteor Network’s cameras caught footage of the shooting star on their cameras in Clanfield, Ash Vale. Reports suggested the meteor crossed Britain from the South East towards the North West. Space scientist Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock said last night's shooting star, though unusually large, was likely to have been no bigger than a closed fist and would have travelled at speeds of around 150,000mph. 'When something like that hits the atmosphere, it burns up really brightly,' she said. 'What was unusual about the thing last night is that usually shooting stars are quite small. 'This was quite a large lump passing through the atmosphere so it made quite a large shooting star.' She said the green or blue flame emitted suggested there was copper in the meteor. CCTV cameras in Cardiff also caught sight of the meteor as it travelled across the UK. This image shows a green light that some Twitter users thought was a UFO . The fireball would have been one of a number of shooting stars that crossed the sky last night, as the Earth passed through a trail of dust left by Halley's Comet - an event which occurs twice each year. Stargazers can expect to see further meteors - around 10 an hour - streaking through the sky until May 20, Dr Aderin-Pocock said. However, they are likely to decrease in intensity and will only be visible at night and when the skies are relatively clear.","The green-tinged shooting star was spotted over Cornwall, Hampshire, Lancashire, South Wales and Worcestershire .

It was only a matter of time before LG officially announced its G Flex curved phone after leaked shots of the device appeared online and the Korean firm unveiled a 6-inch flexible display at the start of the month. In an official press release, LG has taken the wraps off the 6-inch device which is curved vertically so it moulds more comfortably to a user's face and gives improved voice and sound quality. However, in an unexpected move, LG also announced the device has a so-called 'self-healing' case made from an elastic coating capable of 'recovering from daily wear-and-tear scratches and nicks.' LG's G Flex phone, pictured, has an elastic coating capable of recovering from 'daily wear-and-tear scratches' as well as an 'unbreakable' 6-inch curved display.

LG did not explain further how the coating 'heals' itself, just adding that the case keeps the G Flex 'looking newer longer.' The leaked shots that appeared two weeks ago suggested the handset would be curved from top to bottom, and LG claims this design reduces the distance between a user's mouth and the microphone. It also claims the vertically curved shape increases the sound level by three decibels, compared to flat smartphones. The design is also said to offer 'a more reassuring grip and fits more comfortably in a back pocket.' LG released a 55-inch curved TV screen earlier this year, designed to improve the viewing angle of the screen, and the Korean firm claims its new phone offers a similar experience when watching videos and playing games.

The LG G Flex additionally has the Rear Key button first seen on the LG G2 handset.

LG announced at the start of the month it had finished work on the 6-inch flexible OLED display now seen on the G Flex phone. It is made from plastic substrates, rather than glass, and this gives it flexibility as well as making it unbreakable. The phone also has a curved battery, developed by LG's research arm LG Chem.

Isabel Carter, 74, died following a catalogue of failings by East of England Ambulance Service Trust (EEAST), an inquest heard yesterday. The service admitted it had made mistakes in responding to a call from both Mrs Carter’s husband, David, and from her GP. Isabel Carter, 74, pictured with husband David, died of bowel ischaemia - restricted blood flow to the bowel - after an ambulance took four hours to arrive . Mrs Carter, who had bowel ischaemia – inadequate blood supply to the bowel which causes it to become damaged – started to suffer from acute stomach pains at her home in Wymondham, near Norwich, on the morning of December 2, 2011. Her husband called their GP and she was visited by a doctor who examined her and called the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. The doctor informed the hospital that she needed to get a seriously ill pensioner to the to the surgical assessment ward within two hours. She then phoned her surgery and told them to call an ambulance. However, two hours later an ambulance had still not arrived so Mr Carter called the surgery again and was told to dial 999. At the same time, the surgery also called the ambulance service to inform them that the call needed to be upgraded to an emergency. However, the call handler did not upgrade the call. Mrs Carter died following a catalogue of failings by East of England Ambulance Service Trust (EEAST), her husband David and daughter Karen heard at an inquest yesterday . By the time an ambulance did arrive, four hours after it was initially requested, Mrs Carter had collapsed. Paramedics managed to resuscitate her but she died within ten minutes of arriving at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. The inquest was told that survival rates from bowel ischaemia are low even with the right treatment. Senior manager Adrian Maasz led an EEAST inquiry into what went so badly wrong. 1.13pm - The Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital is called by Dr Watts to tell them about Mrs Carter 1.15pm - Dr Watts’ GP surgery calls the ambulance service requesting help3.15pm - Mr Carter calls the surgery to tell them no ambulance has arrived3.43pm - The surgery calls the ambulance service saying the request is urgent and Mrs Carter needs help4.15pm - Mr Carter calls the surgery saying his wife’s condition is worsening.4.20pm - The surgery and Mr Carter call the ambulance trust and are told paramedics are on their way4.25pm - Call from control centre to ambulance in Thetford telling them to go to Mrs Carter’s house4.38pm - Ambulance leaves Thetford for her home in Wymondham6.27pm - Mrs Carter arrives at the hospital6.37pm - Resuscitation attempts stop . He said that demand on the service that afternoon had meant the trust could not get to Mrs Carter within two hours. Mr Maasz said: ‘Undoubtedly there were failings within the control room at that time.’ He said lessons had been learned from Mrs Carter’s case and that it had put in new procedures to ‘significantly’ reduce the chances of similar mistakes. Recording a narrative verdict, deputy coroner David Osborne said Mrs Carter died from bowel ischaemia. The couple moved to Norfolk to be nearer their only child, Karen Holland, and her two children. Mrs Holland said today: ‘Mother was just fantastic. ‘She would take pride in everything I did as her only child and all the things her two grandchildren have done. ‘She was the heart of our family and we just miss her so much.’ Mrs Carter’s son-in-law, Barry Holland, said: ‘We have lost a loving wife, mother and grandmother. ‘The ambulance service let us down on the day. It let Isabel down on the day she needed it most.’ The East of England Ambulance Service said: ‘Following this incident the Trust launched an investigation to identify the issues that led to the delay in the ambulance attending Mrs Carter. ‘This investigation identified that on December 2, 2011, a number of factors contributed to the delay in the ambulance attending some of which included increased 999 call volume, staffing levels in the control room, and incorrect upgrading of the call. The ambulance trust has apologised to Mrs Carter's family - husband David (left), son-in-law Barry Holland (centre) and daughter Karen Holland (right) ‘As a result of the investigation the Trust has increased staffing levels in the Norwich control room, made investment in the addition of more clinical co-ordinators for 24/7 clinical cover in the control rooms, education and training for staff and ensuring more communication around the correct comfort call process is made. John Martin, interim Director of Clinical Quality said: ‘We have apologised to Mrs Carter’s family and shared with them the findings of our investigation and the actions we have taken as a result of this incident. ‘It took too long to get an ambulance to the patient, but as a result of this we have taken steps which the coroner recognised we had implemented and that they’re reviewed regularly.’","Isabel Carter died of bowel ischaemia - restricted blood supply to the bowel .

The plane - dubbed The Wooden Wonder because it was made almost entirely from wood - was one of the fastest aircraft in the world when it was first manufactured in 1941. It was used to intercept Luftwaffe planes launching night raids on Britain. They were also used to drop 4,000lb bombs on Germany which the Nazis were unable to prevent because of the speed of the planes. In total, 7,781 of the planes were manufactured. They were also used by the Australian, US and Canadian Air Forces.

A mother may have to wait a year for the judge’s verdict on a contempt charge against her after bringing her newborn baby to jury duty while breastfeeding. A Missouri judge told new mom Laura Trickle, of Lee’s Summit, yesterday that he would wait to see if legislators would offer a jury duty exemption for nursing mothers before making his verdict according to The Kansas City Star. Jackson County Presiding Judge Marco Roldan also decided to refund a $500 fine given to another breastfeeding mother but said that if legislation did not change, he would re-impose the charge against Ms Trickle and the fine against the other mother. In limbo: Laura Trickle was charged with contempt after bringing her newborn baby Axel to jury duty because she was breastfeeding. Now she might wait a year to find out the judge's verdict . Ms Trickle said: 'The judge stated he is going to follow the law, which is what he should do. 'It’s the law that needs changed.' The judge will review the women’s cases on June 6 next year, taking into account legislative changes if any. Ms Trickle delivered her son Axel Graham in March and was breastfeeding when she was called for jury duty in August. She . asked to be exempt from appearing, as she was breastfeeding, but . received notice that she must report to court to fullfill her civic . obligation and serve jury duty, according to the Kansas City Star. Trickle was told to either arrange for child care or bring somebody with her who could care for the child during jury selection. On September 3, she appeared for jury duty with her child, but according to the ensuing court order, she ‘willfully and contemptuously appeared for jury service with her child and no one to care for the child’. Before making his verdict: Jackson County Presiding Judge Marco Roldan said he would wait to see if legislators offer a jury duty exemption for breastfeeding mothers . Those who skip jury duty can be found in contempt of court and ordered to pay a fine of up to $500 and maybe even be arrested. Twelve states in America have jury duty exemptions for breastfeeding mothers. The mother insists she is not a criminal, saying ‘I’ve never even had a speeding ticket’. Breastfeeding women are exempted from jury duty in 12 states. New . legislation introduced by a St. Joseph physician and state senator, Rob . Schaaf, would exempt breastfeeding mothers from jury duty across . Missouri. Such an exemption would help encourage more Missouri mothers to breastfeed, said state Sen. Rob Schaaf of St. Joseph. ‘Babies . who are breastfed generally are healthier, are less likely to have . certain health problems and will cost the state less resources,’ said . Schaaf to the Kansas City Star. ‘Jury duty is a roadblock to that.’ Missouri statutes allow for exemptions when a juror would face ‘an undue or extreme physical or financial hardship’. 'Not a criminal': Laura Trickle says she has never even had a speeding ticket . Judge Roldan said earlier that he has on some occasions excused potential jurors who just had a death in the family, or teachers who were scheduled to give midterm exams. While keeping some jurors, he often has sought to accommodate their needs, he said. One juror who told Roldan he could not sit for extended periods received a seat in the back row of the jury box, where he was free to stand occasionally, even during testimony. Some health advocates appreciate the accommodations the court makes. ‘Providing . a room for mothers to breastfeed or pump is good, and we very much . encourage that,’ said Anne Biswell of the Mother & Child Health . Coalition, which promotes wellness in the Kansas City area. Court date: June 6 next year is the date set by the judge at Jackson County Courthouse (pictured) to review the case . Roldan, while declining to discuss Trickle’s specific case, said breastfeeding Jackson County mothers have the option of using occasional breaks during jury service to use a private room to pump milk and store it, feeding it to their children later. They are also allowed to bring a caregiver to the courthouse to watch the child during trial proceedings and then take the child to a private room to breastfeed. But Trickle said she has no child care options, and stays at home while Axel’s father works. About 1,000 potential jurors report downtown every month, but the number of judges needing juries varies, and sometimes fewer jurors may be assigned to cases. ‘About 50 per cent are not even going to go upstairs to a case,’ Roldan told the Star. Trickle is one of two breastfeeding Jackson County women who recently have faced possible penalties for not serving jury duty. It’s not that she isn’t willing, she said. ‘The issue is the timing,’ she said. ‘I just can’t do it right now.’","Laura Trickle, of Lee’s Summit, was breastfeeding when she was called for jury duty in August .

Feathers were initially developed to keep birds warm and not for flying, a new study has claimed . Feathers were initially developed to keep birds warm and not for flying, a new study has claimed. Researchers found feathers on prehistoric dinosaurs, which later evolved into birds, were arranged in multiple layers to act as insulation and preserve heat. The study from the Universities of Bristol, Yale and Calgary found that prehistoric birds had a very primitive version of wings, and it was not until millions of years later that they began to evolve for display and camouflage, and then finally to allow the dinosaurs to fly. Instead of flexible, aerodynamic feathers the creatures had rigid layers which acted as simple airfoils and could be used for limited gliding. But over millions of years natural selection modified these into highly-effective feathered wings which could rapidly change their span, shape and area. Dr Jakob Vinther, from the schools of Biological and Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol, said the research showed an intricate picture of how feathers and birds evolved. He said: 'We are starting to get an intricate picture of how feathers and birds evolved from within the dinosaurs. 'We now seem to see that feathers evolved initially for insulation. 'Later in evolution, more complex vaned or pinnate feathers evolved for display. 'These display feathers turned out to be excellent membranes that could have been utilised for aerial locomotion, which only very late in bird evolution became what we consider flapping flight. 'This new research is shedding light not just on how birds came to fly, but more specifically on how feathers came to be the way they are today - one of the most amazing and highly specialised structures in nature.' The research, published in the journal Current Biology, looked at two different pre-historic species, the Anchiornis huxleyi a dinosaur, and the Archaeopteryx lithographica, a Jurassic bird, thought to be 155 million years old. Plumage: An artist's impression of the feathered ornithomimid dinosaurs found in Alberta, Canada . Both species involved a combination of dinosaur and bird characteristics and allowed the scientists to investigate their feathers. They found that the wings differed greatly from modern day birds and were composed of multiple layers of long feathers. The individual feathers were relatively weak due to slender shafts, the layering is likely to have produced a strong airfoil, early experiments in the evolution of the wing. But the study revealed however the inability of pre-historic birds to separate their feathers suggested that taking off and flying at low speeds may have been limited. Instead scientists suggested that the wings were primarily used in insulation, or when needed in high-speed gliding or flapping flight.The research also found that once the feathers had evolved by natural selection the basic wing configuration remained almost the same for 130 million years. As the role of aerodynamics and the mechanics of flight becoming more apparent, birds developed wings which included a layer of long, asymmetrical flight feathers with short covert feathers on top. This meant they were able to separate and rotate them to gain height, change direction and even hover. Dr Nicholas Longrich of Yale University added: 'By studying fossils carefully, we are now able to start piecing together how the wing evolved. 'Before, it seemed that we had more or less modern wings from the Jurassic onwards. 'Now it’s clear that early birds were more primitive and represented transitional forms linking birds to dinosaurs. 'We can see the wing slowly becoming more advanced as we move from Anchiornis, to Archaeopteryx, to later birds.'","Study from the Universities of Bristol, Yale and Calgary found that prehistoric birds had a very primitive version of wings .

Sonar expert Jeff Neasham used cheap components to make a hand-held scanner which can plug into a laptop and produce pictures of the unborn child on the computer screen. The Newcastle University lecturer’s device could be manufactured for £30-£40 compared to the ultrasound machines in UK hospitals which cost £20,000 to £100,000. That means the scanners - devised by Mr Neasham and research associate Dave Graham - would be much more affordable for developing countries.

In use: Mr Neasham demonstrates his new ultrasound scanner with mother-to-be Lucy Ord from Newcastle . The 39-year-old father-of-two was inspired when his wife Zoe was expecting their first daughter, who is now seven. He said: 'The idea came from my own experiences sat looking at the pictures of our unborn child. 'It was my wife’s idea - she suggested we could apply what we knew to make them more affordable and make a low-cost system for lots of people around the world. 'My background is in sonar which is very similar to ultrasound. 'I started to have a think and I just treated it as an interesting engineering challenge, to see what was the absolute minimum cost of components needed to produce any kind of useful image. 'We ticked along on a shoe-string budget then we started to get some promising results and so we got funding to build a prototype. 'We used techniques we use in sonar signal production to simplify the circuitry and transducer design while trying to maintain a reasonable resolution in the images. 'We are not at the stage where we can completely match the image quality of a really high-end scanner but we are getting closer and closer.' The technology could have a major life-saving effect as UN figures show 250,000 women die every year from complications during pregnancy or child birth. Many deaths are avoidable, but for a lack of equipment. Mr Neasham said his images could easily show if a baby was in the breach position, but the definition was not yet high enough to determine the sex.

Zohar recalls a Diana who was totally lacking in confidence when he first painted her. He said: ‘It was funny because I had to keep reassuring her how attractive she was.’ Zohar had only come to the UK two years earlier when he was commissioned for Diana's portrait. His work had been spotted at his first exhibition in England held at a Mayfair gallery by an officer of the 13th/18th Royal Hussars. The regiment wanted a portrait of its colonel in chief to hang at its headquarters. Mr Zohar expected to have to paint an old man with a moustache, but was shocked when he discovered his subject was Diana.

However, Milan’s city administration said the pair, who count Kylie Minogue and Kate Moss among their celebrity fans, would no longer be able to use any public spaces for their shows as they were bad for the city’s image. Commercial director Franco D’Alfonso said: ‘Any time designers Dolce and Gabbana submit requests for public space, the council must keep the doors closed to them. ‘Their fashion is seen as excellent the world over, but we do not need tax evaders to promote us.’ The designers are hitting back at Milan council after a city councillor said the duo not be allowed to show their collections in Milan's communal spaces after their convictions . The designers afterwards reacted with rage. In a furious tweet Stefano Gabbana wrote: ‘Milan council: You’re disgusting!!!’ And today its Milan stores, Martini bar and restaurant, Gold, were shut in protest, exhibiting signs in the windows saying ‘Closed in indignation’, in both English and Italian. 'We are no longer willing to suffer undeservedly the accusations of the financial police and the income revenue authority, attacks from public ministers and the media pillory we have already been subjected to for years,' they said in a statement. Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce in happier times after presenting their collection in Milan last year . The pair said they would continue to pay their more than 250 employees in Milan during the temporary closure of all their nine shops in the city. The conviction follows an investigation that began in 2008 as part of a tax-avoidance crackdown amid the eurozone crisis. The two founders of the iconic . fashion house, with six others, evaded taxes for several years after . setting up a front company in Luxembourg. The . creators of the world-famous Dolce & Gabbana brand who are expected . to appeal, were also ordered to pay compensation to Italy’s tax . authorities. Dolce & Gabbana will appeal their sentences and the company appears to conducting business as usual, with an advert featuring Matthew McConaughey and Scarlett Johansson being filmed earlier this month . When the charges were first made public, Stefano Gabbana condemned the Italian tax authorities as ‘thieves’, and threatened to leave the country. Tax evasion is thought to cost Italy €200billion (£170billion) a year. Several cases involving celebrities have led to out-of-court settlements; in 2000 opera singer Luciano Pavarotti paid 24billion lira (£8million) in back taxes, while MOTOGP champion Valentino Rossi agreed to hand over €39million (£33million) in 2008.","Dolce & Gabbana have shut shops in Milan to protest public criticism .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 09:51 EST, 27 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:46 EST, 30 December 2012 . End of an era: Peter Parker's life takes a wild turn in the pages of Amazing Spider-Man No. 700 . After 50 years of spinning webs and catching a who's who of criminals, Peter Parker is out of the hero game. But Spider-Man is still slinging from building to building - reborn, refreshed and revived with a new sense of the old maxim that Ben Parker taught his then-fledgling nephew that 'with great power, comes great responsibility.' Writer Dan Slott, who's been penning Spidey adventures for the better part of the last 100 issues for Marvel Entertainment, said the culmination of the story is a new, dramatically different direction for the hero that Steve Ditko and Stan Lee created in 1962. 'This is an epic turn,' Slott said. 'I've been writing Spider-Man for 70-plus issues. Every now and then, you have to shake it up... The reason Spider-Man is one of the longest running characters is they always find a way to keep it fresh. Something to shake up the mix.' And in the pages of issue 700, which came out yesterday, it's not just shaken up, it's turned head over heels, spun in circles, kicked sky high and cracked wide open. Parker's mind is trapped in the withered, decaying dying body of his nemesis, Doctor Octopus aka Otto Octavius. Where's Doc Ock? Inside Parker's super-powered shell, learning what life is like for the brilliant researcher who happens to count the Avengers and Fantastic Four as friends and family. The two clash mightily in the pages of issue 700, illustrated by Humberto Ramos and Victor Olazaba. But it's Octavius who wins out and Parker is, at least for now, gone for good, but not before one more act of heroism. Slott said that it's Parker, whose memories envelop Octavius, who shows the villain what it means to be a hero. Twist: In Amazing Spider-Man No. 700, Parker's mind is trapped in the withered, decaying dying body of his nemesis, Doctor Octopus aka Otto Octavius . 'Gone are his days of villainy, but since it's Doc Ock and he has that ego, he's not going to try and just be Spider-man, he's going to try to be the best Spider-Man ever,' said Slott. Editor Stephen Wacker said that while Parker is gone, his permanence remains and his life casts a long shadow. Villain? Doctor Octopus is one of Spider-Man's greatest enemies, who controls four mechanical arms attached to his body . 'His life is still important to the book because it affects everything that Doctor Octopus does as Spider-Man. Seeing a supervillain go through this life is the point - trying to be better than the hero he opposed,' Wacker said. 'Doc has sort of inspired by Peter's life. That's what I mean when he talks about the shadow he casts,' he said. The sentiment echoes what Uncle Ben said in the pages of 'Amazing Fantasy' No. 15, Slott said. Editor Stephen Wacker called it a fitting end to the old series, which sets the stage for a new one - 'The Superior Spider-Man' early next year - because it brings Peter Parker full circle, from the start of his crime-fighting career to the end. 'In his very first story, his uncle died because of something he did so the book has always been aimed at making Peter's life as difficult as possible,' Wacker said. 'The book has always worked best when it's about Peter Parker's life, not Spider-Man's.' And with Octavius influenced by Parker's life - from Aunt May to former girlfriend Gwen Stacy to ex-wife Mary Jane - it will make him a better person, too. 'Because Doctor Octopus knows all of those things and will make decisions on what he saw Peter going through,' Wacker said. 'In a way, he gets the ultimate victory as he becomes a better hero.' Webspinner: Spider-Man's first appearances were in Amazing Fantasy No. 15, left, and in Amazing Spider-Man No. 1, right . Amazing Fantasy No. 15: First appearance of Spider-Man (1962)The work of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko came to fruition in the publication of this book in 1962, thus beginning the Spider-Man phenomenon. Here, the world is introduced to Peter Parker, a wimpy high school student who becomes a superhero with the bite of a radioactive spider. After the death of his beloved Uncle Ben at the hands of a burglar whom Parker refused to stop when he had the chance, he took on the mantle of Spider-Man. Last year, a copy of the classic comic sold at auction for a whopping $1.1million.Amazing Spider-Man No. 1: Spider-Man's first standalone title (1963)Spidey gets his first title, and the official beginning of the Spider-Man franchise. Here, we meet Spider-Man's first supervillain, the interchangeable Chameleon, and Peter Parker's boss, the ever-agitated J. Jonah Jameson, publisher of The Daily Bugle. Also appearing in the book are another Stan Lee creation, the Fantastic Four. Villainous: In Amazing Spider-Man No. 14, left, the world is introduced to the Green Goblin, who makes life catastrophically difficult for Peter Parker in Amazing Spider-Man No. 121, right . Amazing Spider-Man No. 14: First Appearance of the Green Goblin (1964)In this issue, Spider-Man comes face to face with one of his greatest foes for the first time, the infamous Green Goblin, who would torment the hero for years to come. His identity would later be revealed as that of Norman Osborn, the father of Peter Parker's best friend Harry. The Goblin would remain resilient in the Spider-books, even when Norman Osborn was seemingly killed. Numerous other characters donned the green jeans over the next decades, including Harry.Amazing Spider-Man No. 121: The death of Gwen Stacy (1973)The Green Goblin may have given Spider-Man a few bumps and bruises in battle before, but he sunk to a new low when caused death of Peter Parker's girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, tossing the girl off a bridge. Though Spider-Man tried to rescue her by catching her with a web line, he pulled her up to find the awful truth: his girlfriend was dead. Gwen Stacy's death remained in the back of Peter's head. The hero's new clothes: Spider-Man temporarily decides to ditch his classic red and blue suit in Amazing Spider-Man No. 50, left, while abandoning it for a black costume in No. 252, right . Amazing Spider-Man No. 50: Spider-Man No More (1967)Peter Parker decides to hang up his tights in the events of this issue. Plagued by his Aunt May's recent illness, slipping grades, and a campaign by Jameson for Spider-Man's head, Parker decides that perhaps being Spider-Man is no longer a good idea. It didn't take long for Peter to have a change of heart, but his reluctance to keep playing the hero is a notion no spider-fan has been able to forget. Also making an appearance in this comic is Wilson Fisk, the crime boss known as the Kingpin.Amazing Spider-Man No. 252: First appearance of the black costume (1984)Spider-Man raised eyebrows when he ditched his classic red and white tights for a haunting black suit, which debuted in this issue. But what Parker didn't know was that his new suit was alive, an alien being that was enhancing his already impressive spider gifts while trying to bond with him. Ditching the suit in favor of his old clothes in a later issue would prove to be one of Spider-Man's biggest mistakes. Enemies in black: Spidey faces off with the Punisher in Amazing Spider-Man No. 129, left, and with Venom in No. 300, right . Amazing Spider-Man No. 129: First appearance of the Punisher (1974)Frank Castle, the unforgiving vigilante known as the Punisher, makes his debut in the pages of Spider-Man with this adventure. Dedicated to hunting Spider-Man with lethal force and fueled by vengeance, the Punisher became a staple in the Marvel universe with his excellent marksmanship and seemingly endless cache of weapons. Also making his first appearance is the dastardly Jackal.Amazing Spider-Man No. 300: First full appearance of Venom (1988)It wasn't until No. 300 when Spider-Man went toe-to-toe against the most ruthless villain he had ever faced, the terrifying Venom. He was a product of Spider-Man's spurned black alien costume, which found former reporter Eddie Brock, a man who blamed with web-spinner for his failed career and marriage. Joined by their mutual hatred, their first battle ended with a notch in the win column for Spider-Man, but the two would not be done yet. 'Torment' and bliss: Todd McFarlane handled the art and the story in Spider-Man No. 1, left, while Amazing Spider-Man Annual No. 21, right, featured Spider-Man's big day . Spider-Man No. 1: Todd McFarlane's classic cover (1990)The first issue in a new series about the wall crawler, this classic cover was the work of legendary artist Todd McFarlane, who also wrote the 'Torment' storyline featured in the comic. More than a dozen different variants of this cover exist, and McFarlane would later resurrect it in Spider-Man No. 13, except in the black costume.Amazing Spider-Man Annual No. 21: The wedding (1987)One could say that Peter Parker was extremely unlucky at love he crossed paths with Mary Jane Watson, the red-haired beauty who Spider-Man would call his wife after this issue. Attracted to Peter's unbreakable sense of responsibility, Mary Jane, a fashion model and actress, agreed to marry the hero, even after he revealed his deep secret.","In 700th issue out this week, Spider-Man trades bodies with arch nemesis Doctor Octopus .

A London designer believes hybrid organs could one day be created using cells from body parts and even different species that have the potential to help prolong human life. The project aims to create 'circumventive organs' that could help alleviate heart attacks, strokes and the effects of cystic fibrosis. Currently, the organs are merely moulded silicon sculptures designed to look as life-like as possible but could one day become a reality thanks to the concept of bioprinting. The project aims to create 'circumventive organs' that could help prevent heart attacks and strokes. Pictured is a close-up of a tremomucosa expulsum organ in its tray showing detail of its muscular wall, which is designed to vibrate to dislodge mucus to alleviate the symptoms of cystic fibrosis . Agatha Haines created a realistic model (right) of an organ that uses rattlesnake muscles to release mucus from the respiratory system of a person who suffers from cystic fibrosis by expelling it through the stomach. An illustration of the concept is pictured left . Agatha Haines' sculptures aim to be rooted in science and reality as much as possible and are designed to make people think about what sort of man-made organs they would accept into their bodies. The organs utilise the idea of replicating and printing cells in complex structures. The technology could mean different cells with various functions could be put together in new ways to create new organs we would take millions of years to evolve naturally - if at all. A detailed anatomical illustration of the 'cerebrothrombal dilutes' organ that is designed to prevent strokes . If the organ pictured were real, it would contain cells from the saliva gland of a leech. The organ would release an anticoagulant when it feels the pressure of a potential blood clot in the brain as a way of avoiding a stroke . The 'Frankenstein-esque hybrid organs' could then be put together using cells from different body parts or even different species. The first is a defibrillating organ using parts from an electric eel. It is designed to be able to discharge in order to release an electric current to the heart when it recognises it going into fibrillation or heart attack.

A dramatic image of what it might be like to have the 'electrostabilis cardium' organ fitted, showing the 'organ' before implantation into a 'body' Ms Haines also created a realistic model of an organ that uses rattlesnake muscles to release mucus from the respiratory system of a person who suffers from cystic fibrosis.

It would organ using parts from an electric eel to discharge in order to release an electric current to the heart when it recognises it going into fibrillation or heart attack . Ms Haines, the designer behind the gruesome models, said she is interested in whether people are likely to accept these organs . Ms Haines said: 'Whether people are more likely to accept these organs is something that I am trying to question through doing the project. 'I have been interested in how people respond and relate to new body parts, whether it is a transplant or a prosthetic and how sometimes it takes a while to accept this new part as initially it feels alien to the body.' She believes that if the organs can be . partially created from cells from different parts of the human body, . individuals might be more likely to accept them into their bodies. The designer mocked-up what it might be like to have the 'electrostabilis cardium' organ fitted and made a model of cutting through a realistic sternum . Ms Haines said: 'I researched how these cells and tissues exist and look in humans and other species already and how they might look when they are joined to things they aren't usually attached to. 'I then tried to design the shapes they are in based on the functions they have to perform. I also spent a long time testing colours that could give a sense of what the organ does, so I hoped the form might be slightly descriptive of the function.' The models are life-size to show how much space they may take up when inside the human body.","A London designer has made models of 'circumventive organs' that could help prevent heart attacks, strokes and the effects of cystic fibrosis .

An annual list of the richest lawmakers in the U.S. Congress was released today and taking the number one spot is Representative Darrell Issa of California. The Republican earned his estimated $355.4 million through his Viper car alarm company—ironically, since he's been accused by opponents of having himself been a car thief in his youth—and represents the Golden State’s 49th district. Though Issa is identifiable by many for his visible opposition to President Obama, he’s surprisingly less well known than some of his colleagues on the list of Congress’s least wealthy members. Scroll down for video... Stand back from the congressman: Viper Car alarm mogul and California Congressman Darrell Issa is the richest congressperson with a worth of around $355 million . Hillary Clinton’s return to private life helped Issa become the richest federal lawmaker by virtue of culling John Kerry away from the senate and into the White House cabinet. Kerry, whose wife inherited a healthy chunk of the Heinz ketchup fortune, was often at the top of the list released annually by Washington congressional newspaper The Hill. Now Issa has more money than anyone else in Congress. He’s also chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, a job that often pits him against the Democratic president. Each year, Washington congressional newspaper The Hill releases the top 50 wealthiest House representatives and Senators. Topping the list was California congressman Darrell Issa, whose Viper car alarm company, well known for their television commercials and talking warnings, led him to become a self-made millionaire. Here's the worth of the richest 10 of the richest 50: . Saucy: Former Senator John Kerry once held the title thanks to wife Teresa Heinz's ketchup fortune . It should be noted, however, that while Issa has served as a Congressman under President Obama, his personal wealth has more than doubled. The Ohio native, though a watchdog of the president, has for years taken heat for unproven accusations that he actually stole cars, instead of protecting them, in the 1970s. Just behind Issa, in the number two spot, is the man who held the title of number one richest Congressman—Republican Representative from Texas Michael McCaul. McCaul, who oversees the Homeland Security Committee, is worth an estimated $101.9 million thanks to his wife’s family business—Clear Channel Communications. At the opposite end of the spectrum are . Congress’s least wealthy members, some of whom are often cited as 2016 . presidential contenders according to The Washington Post. The other half: With the wealthiest lawmakers must come the least wealthy. Among them are Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky (right, with $455,000) and Kirsten Gillibrand (left, with $166,000) Sweating it: Likely 2016 presidential contender Senator Marco Rubio of Florida actually has a negative net worth of $190,000 . Likely presidential candidate and Kentucky Republican Rand Paul, the Tea Party darling son of two-time presidential also-ran Ron Paul, clocks in with the relatively paltry worth of about $455,000. New York’s Senator Kristen Gillibrand, whose name is also sometimes batted around in the 2016 echo chamber, is worth even less with assets roughly totaling $166,000. And finally, Marco Rubio, another name synonymous with 2016 White House hopes, is actually well in the red.

A mother has told of the terrifying moment a woman broke into her home and tried to strangle her young daughter with a television cable. The intruder barged her way into the home Samantha Adams shares with partner Ryan Cousins and their three children. She threatened to kidnap Miss Adam's four-year-old son Connor before forcing her way upstairs and seizing Ellie-Mae, nine. Traumatic: Couple Samantha Adams and Ryan Cousins, and their children Ellie-Mae Cousins, nine, Connor Cousins, four, and Tallulah Cousins, one, are recovering after their horrifying ordeal . The shocked mother-of-three, 26, managed to fend the woman off long enough to drag the children into another room. As the family barricaded themselves inside, the woman tried to smash the door down. Describing the ordeal herself, little Ellie-Mae said: 'The woman came in and said, ""Hide me, there is a naughty man at the door"". Then she got the wire and put it over my head and I was really scared. ''Mummy came up and stopped her and I was screaming.' Miss Adams said: 'I keep thinking . about what would have happened if she had managed to get the wire round . our daughter’s neck - she could have killed her. 'She . burst in, screaming her head off and locked the door behind her. I was . in the lounge and she ran in, trying to grab my phone. 'Then . she went in the kitchen and grabbed a butter knife - she was shoving it . down her throat trying to make herself sick. She went through periods . of calm and then started kicking off again.' The woman, who is thought to have she burst into two houses in Hull, East Yorks, on Friday, apparently shouted: ‘If they don’t give me my son back, I’m going to take yours and kill him’.

'She pulled the TV wire clean out - the prongs are still in the socket - and had tried to wrap it round Ellie-Mae’s neck. I managed to grab it before she had a chance, but she hit me over the head with the plug.' 'She would be screaming . and yelling one minute and then the next it would be quiet and I could . hear her doing things in the kitchen. I worried she was looking for a . big knife. 'At one point she boiled the kettle and brought it upstairs but I managed to get it off her and throw it at her instead.' Turmoil: Miss Adams' partner Ryan Cousins returned home to find a gaping hole in a door and major damage . Eventually, 20 minutes into the ordeal, Miss Adams managed to get the house phone and make her third attempt to call 999. This . time, she managed to speak to an operator and explain what was . happening, but it would be another 20 minutes before police arrived. She said: 'I’m covered in bruises where she was grabbing me and attacking me through the door. 'But . at one point I did manage to bite her and I also pushed her down the . stairs. But when I bit her, she didn’t even flinch, it was like she . didn’t feel it. 'She picked up a table and was smashing it against the door.' Debris: The family were pinned down in this room while the intruder tried to smash her way inside . When police officers arrived, the woman calmly answered the door and said Miss Adams was the one who was trying to hurt the children. Officers ran upstairs and realised the children were cuddling close to their mother. Miss Adams said: 'As soon as they saw me, they knew it wasn’t me. So they went downstairs, but she’d taken all her clothes off and gone out into the street naked. 'They managed to get her back inside in the living room and pin her down to arrest her.' As police officers were arresting the woman, Miss Adam’s partner Ryan Cousins returned home. Mr Cousins, 31, said: 'I came home to a war zone - the house was a complete mess. I could have come back to four dead bodies, it could have all gone very differently. 'I’m furious about what has happened - people need to know. The kids are so frightened now and get scared when they go to bed.' Humberside Police confirmed a 22-year-old woman has been arrested in relation to the incident and enquiries are ongoing.
