"(CNN) -- His reputation might be that of Formula One's ruthless wheeler dealer, but come the season of goodwill Bernie Ecclestone likes to show a different side to his character. The 84-year-old billionaire's annual Christmas card has often been a way for Ecclestone to get things off his chest and his 2014 offering was no exception as he took aim at a legal case that has cost him $100 million. The card depicts him handing over that sum of money to a highway robber, who is pointing a pistol at him. ""This is not a robbery, I am collecting for the Bavarian state,"" says the man on horseback while a cartoon figure of Ecclestone is seen clutching the sack of money. The greeting on the inside of the card contains says: ""Maybe now we can have a Formula One race in the really nice city of Munich (state capital of Bavaria), Germany."" Earlier this year, a German court agreed to end the bribery trial, in which Ecclestone stood accused, in exchange for a $100m settlement, with $99m going to the Bavarian state treasury and the remainder to a children's charity. Ecclestone, who had strongly denied the charges, was later quoted as saying he was a ""bit of an idiot"" for paying out the huge sum, particularly as he believed he would eventually be cleared. Even by settling the 84-year-old was only left with a small dent -- he paid the $100m within a week -- in his reported $4 billion fortune. Money has often been a theme of previous Ecclestone's Christmas cards. Reigning world champion Lewis Hamilton was the butt of the F1 chief's humor in 2012 after the driver's surprise switch from McLaren to Mercedes. The card showed Hamilton jumping into a Mercedes car driven by Niki Lauda, with the passenger seat containing a large bag marked with a dollar sign. Though world champion Hamilton arguably might be having the last laugh given his recent drivers' title triumph. Getting the tone right for an annual Christmas card isn't always easy to negotiate. Former British Premier Tony Blair has been widely ridiculed for his 2014 card, which shows him standing next to his wife Cherie but smiling in intense and uncomfortable fashion.

"(CNN) -- No team has ever retained the Champions League title since the competition was revamped in 1992 -- but perhaps, finally, this will be the year. Karim Benzema ensured Real Madrid's place in the last-16 by firing his side to a 1-0 win over Liverpool to make it four wins from four. The France international netted a 27th minute winner after Real was made to work hard against a much-changed visiting side. Cristiano Ronaldo, who wasted a number of opportunities, was left frustrated after failing to overturn Raul's Champions League goals record. Ronaldo remains on 70, one behind Raul, while his chief rival, Barcelona's Lionel Messi, plays tomorrow. Messi, who has 69, faces Ajax in Amsterdam on Wednesday and could leapfrog the Portugal star. Real's 12th successive victory was more labored than most would have expected given the side's previous encounter. A fortnight ago, Real rolled into Anfield, a venue where it had never managed a victory, and blew LIverpool away within first 41 minutes of the contest. Led by Ronaldo, Real scored three times in the first half before playing out the remainder of the contest in second gear. Since then, Real has continued its fine form, defeating Barcelona in the Clasico and extending its winning streak to 11 games in succession. Its fortunes could scarcely be any more different to those of Liverpool, a club whose season is already in danger of unraveling. Since the departure of Luis Suarez to Barcelona, Liverpool, which finished second in the Premier League last season, has endured a dismal period in which the success of last year appears nothing but a distant memory. Defeat by Newcastle last weekend left Liverpool 12 points behind leader Chelsea after just 10 games with the pair set to meet at Anfield on Saturday. Brendan Rodgers, the manager, has come in for criticism with a number of his preseason signings failing to impress. One of those, Mario Balotelli, has been heavily criticized, unfairly for the most part, though his failure to score a Premier League goal in any of his eight appearances has raised concern. At the Bernabeu, where Real had not tasted defeat in its previous 19 Champions League matches, Liverpool stepped out as heavy underdogs. Rodgers, wary of the importance of Sunday's clash with Chelsea, omitted several of his regulars from the starting line-up. Steven Gerrard, the long-serving captain and undisputed leader, was left on the bench alongside the stellar talent of Raheem Sterling and the aforementioned Balotelli. For a club such as Liverpool, a five-time champion and one of the proudest and most distinguished clubs in European football, this was some statement. For four years Liverpool had sought to be part of this elite competition and yet, at the home of arguably Europe's greatest club, it named a team which appeared something of a gamble. Kolo Toure, 33, was recalled in central defense, while Fabio Borini, the striker who came close to leaving Liverpool in August, started the contest in attack. For Real, boasting its full array of 'Galacticos', this was a game which was supposed to be a mere procession. Just three minutes had elapsed before Simon Mignolet, the Liverpool goalkeeper, was called into action, pushing away James Rodriguez's fine effort which threatened to sail into the far corner. The Belgium international, who has been prone to mistakes on a number of occasions this season, then denied Ronaldo as the home team began to find its rhythm. Liverpool, without so many first team regulars, may have been expected to fold meekly and yet, for the opening 20 minutes at least, it showed the kind of energy which has seldom been seen so far this season. But there was nothing it could do when Real did eventually take the lead through the prolific Benzema. The France international, whose brace at Anfield put Liverpool to the sword a fortnight ago, found space at the far post and expertly tucked home Marcelo's pinpoint cross. Both Benzema and Ronaldo squandered further opportunities before the interval as Liverpool somehow managed to remain in contention. The second half followed a similar pattern with Real dominating possession, though it seldom managed to find a way past a solid Liverpool defense. Benzema flashed an effort wide of the far post and Ronaldo's free kick stung the palms of Mignolet, but Liverpool coped admirably. Adam Lallana's drive, which flashed wide of the far post, ensured Real couldn't rest on its laurels, though the visiting side barely registered as an attacking force. Gareth Bale, a 62nd substitute, crashed an effort against the crossbar, but Real held out comfortably to book its place in the last-16. While Real is through to the next stage, Liverpool will probably need to win its final two games against Swiss side Basel and Bulgarian team Ludogorets to qualify. ""We had the courage to play and I'm very proud of the team tonight,"" Rodgers told ITV. ""We showed wonderful composure. ""I knew what I was doing. I knew what the team would be tonight. We are disappointed with the result but there are many positives tonight. Some of the young players did very well. ""There's every chance of us qualifying still. We always thought it would come down to the last game and it is in our hands."" Liverpool has three points from its four matches and has not scored in the competition since the opening round. Basel, which overcame Ludogorets of Bulgaria 4-0, sits three points ahead of Liverpool and has already beaten the Premier League side in the competition this season. Dortmund cruise . Elsewhere, Borussia Dortmund booked its place in the next round with a 4-1 win over Galatasaray. But Arsenal will have to wait after somehow managing to throw away a three-goal lead to draw 3-3 with Anderlecht. Mikel Arteta's penalty and Alexis Sanchez's strike gave Arsenal a halftime lead before Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain added a third after 58 minutes. The home side looked certain to claim its place in the next round but perhaps it had not expected what was to follow. Anthony Vanden Borre netted a 61st minute penalty before adding a second soon after. And in the final minute of the contest, Aleksandar Mitrovic stunned those inside Emirates Stadium by plundering a dramatic equalizer. ""We had some bad luck, the first goal was offside but we had a lack of concentration and thought the game was won,"" Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told Sky Sports. ""Overall we were poor defensively from the first to the last minute. At 3-2 you have to secure yourself and we were not cautious enough. It was very poor defending. ""Am I angry or disappointed? Both."" Andrea Pirlo scored a stunning free kick as Juventus secured a 3-2 victory over Olympiakos. Pirlo, making his 100th Champions League appearance, opened the scoring in Turin with Paul Pogba netting a 66th minute winner. ""It was a very important game for us tonight, we had to win and we did it,"" Pogba told Uefa.com. ""I am happy with my goal, but I am happier for the result."" In the night's other games, Atletico Madrid won 2-0 at Malmo, Benfica defeated Monaco 1-0 and Bayer Leverkusen claimed an impressive 2-1 victory at Zenit Saint Petersburg.","Real Madrid qualifies for last-16 of Champions League .

"The successor to Nintendo's troubled Wii U may be on the way. Shigeru Miyamoto, the man who created Nintendo classics such as ""Mario Bros."" and ""The Legend of Zelda,"" says the Japanese gaming giant is at work on a new gaming console. ""For the time being, our focus is on the Wii U hardware, but Nintendo as a whole has groups working on ideas for new hardware systems,"" he said, via a translator, in an interview with The Associated Press. ""While we're busy working on software for the Wii U, we have production lines that are working on ideas for what the next system might be."" 'Mario,' 'Zelda' creator says give the Wii U time . One of the most iconic names in video gaming, Nintendo dominated the market with its Wii console, which sold more than 100 million units after its release in 2006. But the follow-up, Wii U, with its handheld second-screen controller, failed to make a similar splash. The company lost more than $15 million in the final nine months of 2013, largely due to disappointing sales numbers for the Wii U. A sales forecast of 9 million Wii U units in 2013, the console's first full year, was slashed to a mere 2.8 million. This year has seen a slight uptick in sales, with the release of popular titles such as ""Mario Kart 8"" and ""Bayonetta 2."" But the console still trails the rival PlayStation 4 and Xbox One badly in popularity. Things got so bad that there was speculation Nintendo would abandon hardware entirely, instead focusing on developing popular franchises such as Mario and Zelda for other consoles. In the  AP interview, Miyamoto focused on more positive recent news for the company. Released in October, ""Super Smash Bros."" has joined the new ""Mario Kart"" title as a hot seller as have ""amiibos,"" action figures of popular Nintendo characters that can both be collected and used in conjunction with some video games. And there have been reports, via the Sony email hack, that a ""Super Mario Bros."" feature film may be in the works. While the Wii U was released a year earlier than last year's PlayStation and Xbox updates, it's unlikely gamers will see a new Wii in 2015. Several major software releases for the Wii U, including new ""Star Fox"" and ""Legend of Zelda"" titles, already have been announced for the coming year, making it unlikely the company would compete with itself with new hardware.","Nintendo is working on a successor to its Wii U console, designer tells Associated Press .

"Like countless Americans, I recently watched the entire second season of hit political drama ""House of Cards"" in one weekend after U.S. video streaming site Netflix released all 13 nearly hour-long episodes. But the website I logged on was Sohu -- one of the China's biggest online video services -- that purchased exclusive rights to the series for mainland China, and posted the latest season at the same time as Netflix. Glued to my laptop, I couldn't help but notice the major role China plays this season as one riveting plot unfolds after another. If you have been reading news headlines out of China, you would find any of the China angles familiar and believable: suspected cyber espionage, a trade war with Washington, a territorial dispute with Japan -- complete with an utterly corrupt Communist Party insider who boasts direct access to the decision-making Standing Committee. Censors . All this ""realness"" makes it a little surreal that my binge-viewing of the U.S. TV series happened in China. This, after all, is a country where the government allows only 34 foreign films to be screened in cinemas every year, and propaganda authorities routinely censor China-related material from foreign sources that they deem politically sensitive or merely unflattering. Case in point: ""The Blacklist,"" a new American crime drama, is widely available on Chinese video sites -- except Episode 3. That episode has been removed by all streaming services -- including Sohu -- because it features a Chinese spy who kills CIA operatives as its main villain, and critiques China's controversial one-child family planning policy. The China subplots in ""House of Cards,"" Season 2 don't exactly portray the country all that positively, but the government appears to be leaving Sohu alone. ""We didn't know the second season would have so much to do with China -- probably because of the increasing importance of China in global affairs,"" Charles Zhang, Sohu's chief executive, told me at a press conference Tuesday. ""Many Chinese people -- including officials -- are watching it now and we have had no problem."" ""So (the American shows on your site) are not subject to censorship?"" I asked. ""So far, no,"" he replied. Hands off . Some analysts are surprised by the government's largely hands-off approach to video streaming sites, but caution that it may not last. ""New media is allowed to develop with less interference than older forms where there is already a structure in place,"" said Jeremy Goldkorn, a long-time Beijing-based observer and commentator on Chinese media. ""It's going to be regulated just like any other media, especially if it becomes big enough, powerful enough and popular enough."" For now, Sohu is focusing on broadening the appeal of ""House of Cards,"" scrambling to add Chinese subtitles and bombarding visitors to its website with banner ads. Sohu users have clearly noticed. The series' latest and original seasons now occupy the top two spots in Sohu's chart of most-watched American TV shows. Season 2 has been clocking almost three million views a day -- impressive for a complex story that requires a deep understanding of U.S. politics. Gripping plots . In comments left online, many Chinese viewers indicated they are drawn to the show for the same reasons as fans elsewhere: gripping plot twists, superb acting and stark parallel to reality. ""If you have to see the show as social commentary, I think it's a strong diatribe against the political system in the U.S. rather than against China,"" said Raymond Zhou, a well-known columnist for China Daily, the country's official English-language newspaper. ""The narrative doesn't fault China but rather just one individual from China."" A widely circulated Internet post claims that China's anti-corruption tsar -- one of the seven Politburo Standing Committee members who effectively rule the country -- is a loyal fan of ""House of Cards"" and has recommended it to other officials. The anecdote may not be as far-fetched as one might think, considering what the show's Machiavellian protagonist Frank Underwood tells viewers while being sworn in as the U.S. vice president: ""One heartbeat away from the presidency and not a single vote cast in my name -- democracy is so overrated."" With messages like that, ""House of Cards"" seems to be a show China's Communist leaders don't mind their citizens watching at all.","Chinese online video service Sohu purchased exclusive rights to hit U.S. series .

"(CNN) -- They do things differently at Sociedad Deportiva Eibar, up in the mist-cloaked valleys of the Basque country. And it is working. The smallest club ever to compete in Spanish soccer's top flight is debt free, self-sustaining, and steadfast in its determination not to overextend itself. That is a novelty in La Liga, whose two leading lights -- Real Madrid and Barcelona -- are in the red to an estimated combined tune of over $1 billion. Eibar's town has a population of just 27,000 and its football club a miniscule budget to help sustain a charge for safety in its first ever season in the top division. But as the season nears its half way mark, Eibar has nudged its way into the top half of the table and is proving a beacon of fastidiousness in a league that has long sagged heavily with debt. ""The miracle continues,"" grins Eibar president Alex Arranzabal soon after its best result of the season -- a 5-2 home win over relegation rivals Almeria. ""This is quite challenging for the rest of Spanish football. We could be a little bit uncomfortable for a lot of clubs, because they have done things in the opposite way. ""They are now seeing a small club like us can do things in this way and that it works. We are small but we are challenging them."" That Eibar even reached the top table in Spain is staggering, that it is holding its own is even more so. It had the smallest budget in the Spanish second division last year and even after promotion, was threatened with demotion due to its size. It had to raise $2.3 million to comply with a rule that requires every team to have a capital equal to 25% of the average expenses of all sides in the second division, excluding the two clubs with the biggest outgoings and the two with the smallest. But after a share issue attracted pledges from all over the world, Eibar was able to take its place in the top flight and underline its commitment to financial prudence. Many clubs have flirted with ruin throwing millions at top flight survival, but not Eibar. Though Aranzabal has gone full-time and 13 people have been recruited to cope with the demands of La Liga, it will revert to a skeleton staff should the club be relegated. Its €18 million budget for the season is paltry in sporting terms; European champions Real Madrid have spending power of around €762 million to draw on this campaign alone. To underline the gulf between the two, Real's Bernabeu stadium could also accommodate Eibar's population three times and still have 3,000 seats left over. So how is Eibar thriving? ""A club with soul"" Ask Arranzabal, and one of the club's biggest fans Unai Eraso, and the answer is the same -- ""alma"", which translates from Spanish as ""soul."" ""This is a family -- a football club with soul,"" Eraso, head of Eibar's Madrid supporters club, told me in one of the numerous tiny bars dotted round its 5,800 capacity Ipurua stadium. ""The players reflect the nature of the town -- humble, hard-working and with huge spirit. We still have the same people at the club -- the same guy has washed the shirts of the team for the last 10 years."" Arranzabal agrees: ""The team gives this ""alma"" to the people in the stadium. ""It's very important for us that the club and the fans are together because we have to create very special conditions, like a mystique. ""It is raining, everything is dark, surrounded by the Basque mountains and the people are feeling what the players are feeling. It can be quite frightening for the opposition."" Soul is arguably becoming a rare commodity in modern soccer these days. In the past 20 years, mega-money television deals have made some European clubs richer than ever, yet the desire for greater revenue remains insatiable. Player salaries have soared and clubs have developed a keenness to market themselves aggressively in emerging regions, while ticket prices have continued to rise sharply in many places. Should Eibar's meteoric rise continue they may well need to tackle similar issues, but such is the inexorable link between club and town, it is unthinkable such roots would be forgotten. ""The town and the football club -- we are the same,"" Arranzabal explains. ""This is very important for Eibar as a town. We have always been an industrial area and we have had quite a big crisis for the last few years,"" he added referring to Spain's economic problems. ""We used to be a town of 40,000 people 20 years ago but now we are 27,000. Everything was quite difficult for the people in the valley. Football has lifted the general mood of the people. ""You only have to walk round the town and see how many flags hang from the buildings and how many shirts there are of the team. The relationship between the town and the team is unique."" The world's friendliest club? Not only is Eibar the smallest club in La Liga, it must surely rank as the most welcoming. The fans follow the club as resolutely as the low clouds that stick to the hills that surround the town, and they are currently reveling in the greatest season of their lives. Eraso is my chaperon -- a lifelong fan and unrelenting optimist whose ardor for the club and town is evident with each snippet of information he proffers. We meet four hours before kick-off, just as a band of weary souls from Almeria emerge blinking from the bus that set off from their south coast town 10 hours or more ago. He quickly shows off a newspaper cutting of the ""Eibarmy"" from the previous week's victorious trip to Vigo, on the east coast of the country. ""I banged the drum for so long that my hand was bleeding by the end!"" he explains, as well as recounting how the club's clutch of traveling fans were greeted warmly by the home supporters. It reflects a trend wherever they have been. For while the story of Eibar is widely known and has been celebrated globally -- underlined by the pledges from over 50 different countries during its share issue -- it has also been championed in Spain. ""We have support from around the world,"" Eraso's friend Lander explains. ""Everywhere we've been in Spain other fans congratulate us and want to swap shirts with us. ""Eibar is now famous -- for us this is crazy!"" Not only is there joy at the realization Eibar belongs at this level, there is a distinct sense of pride that it is doing that on its own terms. As the thumping of Almeria unfolds in a constant swirl of wind and rain, Eraso and his friends pace up and down at the back of Eibar's Tribuna Gol Este stand, so hemmed in that plenty of fans nip across the road at halftime for a nerve-steadying beer. The core of its team has been the same the past three seasons, every positive intervention on the field accompanied by a potted history of that player's career to date. ""It is very important to maintain the essence of the group within the club in order to keep the values that have enabled Eibar to reach the ceiling of the Spanish league,"" he explains. ""The players who stay in the club are an example of behavior and sacrifice to the newcomers and not the other way around. Arrogance doesn't belong here!"" The match won it is back to one of the many tavernas surrounding the ground, where Eraso raises the prospect of Eibar qualifying for the Europa League and taking its tour of goodwill across the continent. As their President himself remarked, the dream continues.....","Tiny Eibar is punching above its weight during its first ever season in Spain's La Liga .

"As Spain's economy finds new lows, there is one clear winner in the eurozone crisis: Hong Kong football. The former British colony has had a long tradition with the sport but is ranked 154th in the world, according to FIFA. In the region, the territory ranks 25th, well below leaders Japan and Australia. Despite the city's low ranking, there are some in Hong Kong with a long-term strategy to import players and know-how from the world's best: embattled football-superpower Spain. ""I've decided to come to Hong Kong because opportunities in my country aren't very promising,"" former Spanish La Liga player Lander Panera told CNN. Panera, 30, was concerned about the economy in his home country and chose this year to settle in a place where growth is robust. He recently secured a contract with the local team Southern District, where he shares the playing field with fellow countrymen like Diego Gómez Heredia and Diego Folgar Toimil. Hong Kong's embrace of Spanish footballers doesn't end there. Ken Ng, head of Hong Kong Kitchee, one of the top local teams, has been working with former Spanish athletes for years to develop local players. Recently, the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charity Trust donated US$5.7 million to Kitchee to start a football talent development center. The project aims to make stars out of young Hongkongers with potential. ""It's all about youth development, youth training, and hopefully in six, or eight, or 10 years time we'll have a much better group of youngsters coming through our program, and that will help Hong Kong be one of the strongest teams in Asia,"" Ng told CNN. ""[We] will give Japan a run for their money."" Ng brought two Spanish veterans to the Far East to help: Josep Gombau, a veteran of Barcelona youth football education and current Kitchee head coach, and retired La Liga player Roberto ""Chino"" Losada, also a former Kitchee player. The project includes international exposure for young players, not only with foreign coaches but also with extensive travel. ""We will give them a view of the world,"" Ng told CNN, ""every year we will take them to Spain."" There, the players will compete in events like the Mediterranean International Cup, a top juvenile international tournament held in Catalonia. The Kitchee's team competed there last March. ""It's all about youth development, youth training,"" Ng said. In the meantime, Spanish players like Panera are considering Hong Kong as a permanent home. ""If things don't improve in my country, in Europe, I wouldn't have a problem [staying in Hong Kong],"" Panera told CNN.","Football players from hard-hit Spain are finding new careers in Hong Kong .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama struck down a rule Friday that prohibits U.S. money from funding international family-planning clinics that promote abortion or provide counseling or referrals about abortion services. President Obama says he doesn't want family planning to be used as a ""political wedge."" Obama said in a statement that family planning aid has been used as a ""political wedge issue,"" adding that he had ""no desire to continue this stale and fruitless debate."" The policy says any organization receiving U.S. family-planning funds from the U.S. Agency for International Development cannot offer abortions or abortion counseling. ""It is time we end the politicization of this issue,"" Obama said. ""In the coming weeks, my administration will initiate a fresh conversation on family planning, working to find areas of common ground to best meet the needs of women and families at home and around the world."" Obama's memorandum reversing the policy comes the day after the 36th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. The landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision held that a woman's right to an abortion fell within the right to privacy protected by the 14th Amendment. The ruling gave a woman autonomy over her pregnancy during the first trimester.  Watch CNN's Bill Schneider on how Obama is handling abortion issue » . The memorandum reverses the ""Mexico City policy,"" initiated by President Reagan in 1984, canceled by President Clinton and reinstated by President George W. Bush in 2001. The policy, referred to by critics as ""the global gag rule,"" was initially announced at a population conference in Mexico City. Reversing the previous administrations' stance on the policy was one of Clinton's first acts as president in January 1993 and the very first executive order issued by Bush on January 22, 2001, the 28th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Critics, including Planned Parenthood, called Bush's move a ""legislative ambush."" He defended his action, saying, ""It is my conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortion or actively promote abortion."" The group Population Action International praised Obama's move, saying in a statement that it will ""save women's lives around the world."" ""Family planning should not be a political issue; it's about basic health care and well-being for women and children,"" the group said. ""Women's health has been severely impacted by the cutoff of assistance. President Obama's actions will help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, abortions and women dying from high-risk pregnancies because they don't have access to family planning."" Republican lawmakers were critical of the new president's action. ""Not even waiting a week, the new administration has acted to funnel U.S. tax dollars to abortion providers overseas,"" Rep. Tom Price, R-Georgia, said in a written statement. ""This is a stunning reversal of course from the president's campaign statements that he hoped to reduce the number of abortions. Just a day after thousands of Americans came to Washington to celebrate the principle of life, President Obama has made it clear that reducing abortions is not one of his priorities."" In his statement, however, Obama said he had directed his staff ""to reach out to those on all sides of this issue to achieve the goal of reducing unintended pregnancies."" ""They will also work to promote safe motherhood, reduce maternal and infant mortality rates and increase educational and economic opportunities for women and girls."" The president added that he looked forward to ""working with Congress to restore U.S. financial support for the U.N. Population Fund."" The Bush administration has repeatedly withheld funding authorized by Congress for the U.N. fund, saying the agency has funded a forced sterilization program in China. The fund has repeatedly denied that accusation. ""By signaling his intention to restore U.S. funding for UNFPA, the UN Population Fund, President Barack Obama is signaling his re-engagement with the international community on the critical challenge of improving reproductive health around the world,"" UN Foundation President Timothy Wirth said. ""For the past seven years, UNFPA funding has been a victim of false accusations and misinformation that had everything to do with politics and nothing to do with sound policy,"" he said. ""Approximately 180 industrialized and developing countries, including all the countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, contribute to UNFPA. The United States was the only country to withhold funding for political reasons.""

"When a college girlfriend called to tell me she was dating someone new, I asked the standard, superficial questions any 20-something pal would: . ""How tall?"" ""He's a foot taller than me!"" ""What does he do?"" ""He's actually just finishing up school."" ""He's in your master's program?"" ""Not quite."" At the time, a year ago now, he was 20 and she was 23. Mrs. Robinson she's not; their three-year age difference isn't exactly shocking. It makes sense that two students (she was earning a master's degree and he was working toward his bachelor's) would meet working a part-time job. Yet, during a recent gathering of girlfriends, she seemed to be the target of as many cougar jokes as Mariah Carey was in 2008 when she married Nick Cannon. (At 32, Cannon is a decade younger than the singer.) It probably didn't help that, at the start of their relationship, my friend's suitor couldn't  legally accompany her to the bar. ""It makes people really uncomfortable for some reason,"" she said in response to my own mindless cougar quip. As the public becomes accustomed to tales of 40- and 50-year-old women who date younger men, 20- and 30-something women who do the same are still regarded as a strange species. In popular parlance, these young lovers of even younger men are dubbed ""pumas."" Take actress Jamie-Lynn Sigler, for example. After announcing her engagement to 23-year-old baseball player Cutter Dykstra last week, the 31-year-old took flak in some online comment sections. ""I can't imagine being 31 and relating so much to a 23 y/o male...they are too immature still!"" said one commenter. Another called Sigler ""a mini cougar."" One People.com commenter even suggested that 2013 was ""the year of the 'young-er cougar,' "" noting that race car driver and model Danica Patrick, 30, is dating fellow driver Ricky Stenhouse Jr., 25. Three to five years hardly calls for puma and cougar jokes, said Hugo Schwyzer, a professor of history and gender studies at Pasadena City College. If it were the women who were three to five years younger, he added, people would say it's the perfect age gap. ""The biggest obstacle (these couples) are going to face is this enduring myth that boys develop more slowly than girls,"" Schwyzer said. ""We just repeat that as if that's absolutely true. It is developmentally largely true when dealing with infants and toddlers ... but once you get to adulthood, you know, 18 is 18."" Of course, as far as ""The Twilight Saga"" is concerned, 18 isn't always 18. While Bella jokes that she's ""not really into the whole cougar thing"" regarding a guy two years her junior, her seemingly teenage vampire boyfriend is actually more than 100 years older than she is -- and that's not creepy at all? As more Hollywood actresses and models, such as Eva Longoria, date younger men, the unwarranted stigma surrounding such relationships will fade, matchmaker Patti Stanger said. But for now, a Celebuzz gallery titled ""Hollywood's cougars"" includes Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban. She's four months older than he is. Stanger's general rule of thumb for dating, regardless of who is on the winter end of the May-December romance, is ""10 up, 10 down."" If a couple is 11 years apart in age, she said, ""don't cry. It's no big deal. But if you go 15, you're screwed."" Stanger has also mentioned this notion on her reality show, ""The Millionaire Matchmaker,"" which is in its sixth season on Bravo. On the series, she often takes on male and female clients who are looking for someone significantly younger than they are. When that happens, Stanger added, cultural references are lost and one person assumes the caretaker role, which can be a problem when that person is the woman. ""When you do 15 years, when you do Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher, it's going to run its course,"" she added. ""It can't last when the woman is older than the man. When the man is older than the woman, unfortunately, there is a double standard and it does last. Especially in different cultures ... that is the norm because a man is supposed to provide and guide for his woman."" The puma and cougar debate also has a place among gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender daters, though the lines are blurrier. When 26-year-old actress Amber Heard and 36-year-old photographer Tasya van Ree went public with their relationship in 2010, age wasn't at the forefront of reports the way it was for Carey and Cannon. ""Opinions on age difference run the gamut from fearful to desirable,"" author Dave Singleton wrote regarding the gay community in his Match.com column, ""Ask Dave."" ""There's no hard and fast rule on whether age differences sink the love boat,"" Singleton wrote. ""But age is definitely a factor when you date someone. ... In my research with gay men for my book, 'The Mandates: 25 Real Rules for Successful Gay Dating,' I never met one who described a date without telling me the guy's age first."" As Schwyzer says, ""The problem is largely cultural at this time. ... (There will be) jokes about robbing a cradle. The expectations are somehow that (a woman is) not capable of being with a grown man and has thus chosen to date someone who our society thinks of as a boy."" In October, London-based video blogger Emily Hartridge, 28, posted a video about the benefits of dating a younger man. The comedic vlog listed reasons such as ""younger guys try harder to please you"" and ""you get to feel more in charge"" among the perks. Another plus for some career-driven, powerful women in their 20s and 30s, Schwyzer said, is that millennial men tend to be more open about gender roles. ""For decades women have moved into traditionally male spaces,"" he added. ""With some millennial guys ... we're not seeing more guys who are feminine, but flexible."" For my friend, the best thing about dating a younger man -- at least her younger man -- is that there's no noticeable age difference at all. I can pick on her all I want for dating someone the same age as my younger sister. And I'll probably continue to do so -- out of love, of course. But truth be told, there's less of a cultural gap between her and her younger beau than there was between my last boyfriend and me. At six years my senior, he was behind the wheel of a car while I was still riding around the neighborhood on my Razor scooter. At least my ""cougar"" friend and her juvenile boyfriend can both recall growing up listening to cassette tapes, playing video games on the original PlayStation, and watching Bill Clinton deny that he had ""sexual relations with that woman"" -- even if one of them wasn't quite sure what that meant at the ripe old age of 6.","After announcing her engagement to a 23-year-old, Jamie-Lynn Sigler, 31, took flak .

"(CNN) -- Recent revelations in print and now on television by convicted match fixer Wilson Raj Perumal are once again throwing the spotlight onto match-fixing in football. Coercing players, officials and administrators into rigging matches has netted fixers millions of dollars while football is left counting the cost to its integrity. How big is the problem? It's widespread, says Terry Steans, who has worked as an investigator for football's world governing body, FIFA. ""I never thought it would be across the globe but it is, and that's the most surprising thing to me (along with) the consummate ease with which fixers gained access to football,"" Steans told CNN. In February last year, the European Union's law enforcement agency, Europol announced that 680 matches (380 of them in Europe) played between 2008 and 2011 were under suspicion of being rigged. ""This is the work of a suspected organized crime syndicate based in Asia and operated with criminal networks around Europe,"" Rob Wainwright, director of Europol said following an 18-month probe. Specific matches under scrutiny were not named by Europol, but fixtures include World Cup qualifiers and Champions League ties, they said. Europe's top domestic leagues have been no stranger to football corruption in recent times with notable match-fixing scandals erupting in Germany's Bundesliga in 2005 and Italy's Serie A and B the following season. But match fixing extends far beyond Europe's borders with scandals uncovered in Asia, Africa and Latin America in recent years. Investigators say that much of the problem stems from illegal gambling markets in Asia, which are said to turn over billions of dollars every single day. ""Football is by far the largest betting market in the world and by far the most liquid,"" says Joe Saumarez Smith, a sports betting consultant. Fixers like to target football because there are a lot of matches played, he says. But there are other reasons. ""A lot of players are not very well paid and, particularly in the African leagues, they don't get paid ... so match-fixing becomes more attractive,"" Saumarez Smith says. How do you go about fixing football matches? With alarming ease, if you believe Perumal. ""I've fixed matches with just a single player,"" he says. ""But, of course, you would like to have the goalkeeper, we would like to have the defenders, then the striker ..."" Perumal told CNN that a fix will often start with one player who is offered money to throw a game. If they are happy to play ball, the match fixer will then use the target to sound out other members of the team. Using a group of players to fix a match is advantageous to the fixer because it improves the chances of getting the desired result. It's also more difficult to spot says Declan Hill, author of ""The Insider's Guide to Match-Fixing in Football."" ""You have six players running around trying as hard as they can; and you have five players pretending to run around trying as hard as they can,"" Hill explained in a piece penned for CNN last year. ""This way, the outsider finds it extraordinarily difficult to figure out what is going on. All they see is 11 players who may or may not be making mistakes."" Referees are also prime targets for match fixers and Perumal would frequently attempt to bribe the man in black. Some referees were ripe for corruption, he claims. ""These are people who are supposed to uphold the laws of the game. But sad to say that, you know, FIFA doesn't really pay these referees that well,"" Perumal said. ""They get about $1,000 or maybe $1,500 (per game) which is very small money. In my opinion, FIFA should pay them a lot more or they should start to professionalize this officiating."" When asked about the payment of referees, FIFA told CNN: ""Corruption does not depend on how much you are paid, but instead, and above all, honesty and values of the individual."" There is also evidence that some club owners are corrupting results. ""Europol investigators spoke about this during their conference (in 2013),"" Hill says. ""There are dodgy club owners in Europe who will begin a season by looking at the 40 or so games in the league, and think, 'right, we will try to win these 30 matches, and we will lose these 10,'"" Hill said. ""Knowing that they will lose those specific 10 matches, the club owners will bet against their team and make more money losing those matches, than in winning all the other games."" What are football's authorities doing? A lot or not enough, depending on who you talk to. FIFA points to the ""vast range of measures and initiatives,"" they have implemented in response to match fixing. These include national and regional workshops and an E-learning program developed in partnership with INTERPOL. ""The integrity of the game is a top priority,"" FIFA told CNN. ""We take any allegations of match manipulation very seriously."" But Saumarez Smith isn't convinced the footballing authorities are doing enough yet. ""(They are) slightly better than what they used to be, but they used to be absolutely dreadful,"" Saumarez Smith says. ""In fact, they just had their heads in the sand about it. I remember going to some meetings with leagues 15 years ago and me saying: 'we could do a match-monitoring service,' and they said: 'why would we want that?' They've got a bit more alerted, but they are a long way from where they could be."" Education is also crucial, he thinks. ""The clubs and the league need to have an education program to tell the young players if you are approached by a match-fixer you need to come and tell us,"" he said. ""That needs to be an education process from a very early stage, from 13 or 14 (years old) for players coming from the professional rank or joining clubs."" Improvements have been made at UEFA, he says, pointing to their use of betting monitoring -- European football's governing body annually track more than 30,000 matches across the continent for betting irregularities. FIFA have their own monitoring system called ""Early Warning System,"" but Saumarez Smith questions the organization's capability to deal with corruption. ""I think it's difficult for some people to take them seriously when their own house doesn't appear to be in order,"" he says, noting the continuing controversy surrounding the bidding process for World Cup finals. But Steans, who worked for FIFA from 2010 to 2012, defends his former employer. ""FIFA were really concerned,"" he says. ""For the two years I was there working under Chris Eaton, he was genuinely concerned and tasked us solely to match-fixing. Once you're inside it as a football fan and you're seeing (match-fixing) first hand, you can't help but be concerned for the game."" Will football ever be fix free? Experts aren't sure. ""Fixing and corruption has always been in sport, it's really part of human nature,"" says Declan Hill. ""The trick now is battling this globalized phenomenon of corruption. Frankly, what we need is an independent, international anti-corruption agency for sport, the same way WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) has been set up."" Steans agrees. ""I'd like to think that we could make the majority of the game safe and I feel the only way that can be done is by an independent body being formed -- an international independent body with proper powers,"" Steans says. ""I think individual associations standing alone will always be vulnerable to clever criminals with money and the human condition makes people naturally vulnerable when lots of money is involved.""

"(CNN) -- He seemed, at that moment, less like a rock star than like someone who sort of wandered on stage from the multitudes of motley young people jostling and undulating in the meadow. He appeared dazed and confused: a scruffy, spectacularly unglamorous fellow who somehow found himself among the rock 'n' roll aristocracy who showed up in Woodstock, New York, 45 summers ago to help administer a collective blessing upon a generation. Then Joe Cocker started to sing a song that, it's safe to say, everybody within hearing range of that stage knew by heart. It was what was widely recognized as the ""Ringo"" number from the already classic Beatles album, ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"" from two years ago. ""With a Little Help From My Friends"" was the kind of catchy, user-friendly ditty that even a stuffy grown-up could love enough to sing along with decades before anyone heard the word ""karaoke."" Anybody, in other words, could make the song work for them, whether in a shower or a corner bar. Joe Cocker, at that moment, did more than just make it work. He worked that song over, ripping its delicate, amiable stitching apart and transfiguring it into something with more grandeur, tumult and dramatic tension than the Beatles could have imagined. The cameras that captured that transfixing performance for all time stayed on him for practically the entire song, drifting up and down Cocker's spasmodic form, focusing on his hands as they mimed an invisible instrument wrenching every lick, spin and extended variation he could summon through the vibrant coarseness of his voice. That little ditty Ringo Star introduced to the world became, in Cocker's fitful, jerking hands, an epic flag waver, a soul-music anthem. Cocker didn't just ""cover"" that song. He conquered it and made it his own. His performance, one of the many peaks of the 1970 eponymous documentary about that festival, ""Woodstock,"" was the first thing most people of a certain age thought of when they heard the news of Cocker's death at 70 from lung cancer. It was what Monday's CBS Evening News broadcast mentioned first and foremost when mentioning Cocker's passing and the film clip accompanied many tweets and posts on social media. Galvanic as that moment was, it was only the beginning of a solid, steady career for Cocker, who scored serial blues-rock hits throughout the 1970s, including ""Feelin' Alright"" and ""You Are So Beautiful."" His 1982 duet with Jennifer Warnes, ""Up Where We Belong,"" pretty much capped his string of hits. His gravelly voice and his contortions, however, remained in demand throughout the world, and it says something about his enduring appeal that so many people from different generations say they went straight to those and other tunes to hear that aching, fiery growl once again. Most appropriately, for a man who exploded into being at a long-ago festival devoted to ""peace and love,"" there came a special tweet today from someone wishing the same to Cocker's spirit. It came from Ringo Starr.","Gene Seymour: Joe Cocker made iconic version of ""With a Little Help From My Friends"" at Woodstock .

"(CNN) -- Success just keeps on coming for Rory McIlroy, but the world's No. 1 golfer is already targeting more. McIlroy became the first player since Padraig Harrington in 2008 to win back-to-back majors Sunday as he claimed the U.S. PGA Championship just three weeks after getting his hands on the British Open. The 25-year-old battled back from a poor start to his final day at Valhalla to card a three-under-par 68 and finish one shot clear of second-placed Phil Mickelson. The victory -- the second time McIlroy has captured the Wanamaker Trophy -- means he has now won three straight tournaments, having also triumphed at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational last week. The Northern Irishman, though, has already turned his attention to claiming a fifth major at the Masters next year -- the only one missing from a career grand slam collection. After a disappointing 2013, and then the breakup of his long-term relationship with tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, McIlroy is now firmly focused on achieving his golfing goals. ""I've realized this year that we only have one go at this, we only have a certain time span as a career,"" he said. ""Golf careers are typically longer than other sporting careers but there's only a certain window, and every tournament you don't win is a missed opportunity."" Augusta was the scene of his final-day collapse in 2011 in which he dropped a four-shot lead to ultimately finish 10 strokes off the pace. ""I didn't want to go to Augusta next year having not won this,"" McIlroy told CNN after Sunday's victory in near darkness after a weather delay. ""I wanted to go to Augusta with four major championships, and I want to go to Augusta next year trying to win five and trying to win the career grand slam. ""I've refocused and I've rededicated myself and this is important to me. This is my career and I want to make the most of it."" McIlroy will also be hoping to join an elite club by winning three consecutive majors. Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods are the only professional golfers to have achieved such a feat, but McIlroy is confident he has what it takes to join the trio of golfing greats. ""Going to Augusta next year, trying to complete the career grand slam for a start, and then trying to complete the third leg (winning three straight majors) -- I'm going to go to Augusta next year with a lot of expectation and a lot of hype, and one thing that I need to do is try to handle those,"" he said. ""I know Augusta is a good course for me and I have to beat the same guys that I beat this week, and I have to try and beat the same guys that I try and beat week-in, week-out. ""That gives me a lot confidence, knowing that I can handle this sort of pressure down the stretch of a major, and that gives me a lot of confidence going into Augusta next year.""","Rory McIlroy thrilled with U.S. PGA Championship win .

"Actress Melissa McCarthy recently told Redbook that she asked multiple designers to make her a dress two Oscar seasons ago. They all said no. She was disappointed. ""I don't understand why if you're a certain size, designers think your taste level goes down,"" she said in the interview. But then, frustrated by the lack of options, she took matters in her own hands, working with a designer on her own gowns. She will debut an original line of plus-sized clothing next spring. Body shaming is a part of American culture, at once abhorrent and everywhere. Women are shamed for being fat, skinny, tall, short, flat chested, busty, too plain, too sexy. But lately, there seems to be a different response, similar to McCarthy's -- frustration followed by acceptance and moving on. Modern women are saying, sure, looks may matter.  But they're not that big of a deal, just one aspect of a complex person who can be described in a number of ways: my size is not all of who I am. One way women, particularly celebrity women, have stood up to fat shaming has been to disregard the comments and name calling, refusing to be called ""fat"" or stating a certain pride in their bodies. After designer Karl Lagerfeld called British singer Adele ""a little too fat,"" she told People magazine that she embraced her curves. ""I've never wanted to look like models on the cover of magazines,"" she said. ""I represent the majority of women, and I'm very proud of that."" The public is also showing their appreciation. When Mekayla Diehl, Miss Indiana USA, showed off her bikini body, Twitter responded in praise of her ""normal"" body. And not all women are afraid of the word ""fat,"" or necessarily proud of how they look. That's OK, too. In a recent episode of ""Louie,"" the character Vanessa, played by actress Sarah Baker, put it this way to the show's titular character, played by comedian Louis C.K.: ""The meanest thing you can say to a fat girl? It's 'you're not fat.' "" Louis C.K.'s 'Fat Girl' strikes a nerve . The line was part of a nearly seven-minute speech about society's persistent fat shaming and the double standards that make it ""adorable"" for a man to admit he's overweight, yet something closer to pathetic for a women to do the same. As Vanessa says, ""It's too much for people. ... they call the suicide hotline on me."" Being fat, after all, is still viewed as the most horrible, devastating thing a woman could be -- a date with a destiny comprised of a houseful of cats. Check your 'cat-lady' preconceptions about childless women . As Vanessa tells Louie in that episode, being fat ""sucks,"" but it's just one thing about her. She's also funny, fun, smart and confident. She has a good job. She doesn't need to call on euphemisms to describe how she looks. She's not ""full-figured."" She's not curvy or plus-size. She's fat. It might not be the best thing about her, but it's also not the worst thing. And it might be the most important message women, and men, have heard so far. Women used to shy away from calling themselves overweight as a way to protest thin culture and rebel against society's fixation on what women look like and what size jeans they wear. But the truth is that the focus on appearance is not going away, least of all for women. We live in a time when tabloids routinely question whether female celebrities are pregnant and dissect their bikini bodies. And yet a male celebrity can run around on the beach with a bit of a pooch and a girl 15 years his junior and no one talks about how liberated he is for ""embracing his flaws"" nor about his transformation when, months later, he loses the extra weight. Female celebrities, though, get covers and four-page features on the topic. So instead of ignoring their weight, pretending it doesn't exist or doesn't matter to them or to anyone else, McCarthy, Baker and other modern women are acknowledging and owning it -- then dismissing its significance. And that's even more powerful.","Recent moments in pop culture show women taking a novel approach toward fat-shaming .

"The world's oldest commissioned warship is to undergo a £16 million ($25m) revamp, in what British defense authorities hope will restore the iconic battleship that is so central to Britain's legacy as a maritime power. It will be the most extensive restoration to HMS Victory in more than 200 years, when she underwent repairs following the Battle of Trafalgar. ""It's a massive task,"" says project manager John O'Sullivan of BAE Systems, which has been contracted to carry out the works for five years with an option to extend that for a further five. However O'Sullivan believes a ship of this nature will always be a work in progress. ""The first five years will be intense, but it's ongoing forever, it needs constant work."" HMS Victory was commissioned in 1778 and during three decades of service she saw some of the most legendary clashes. She's the only surviving warship from the American War of Independence, the French Revolutionary War and the Napoleonic wars. It's for the Battle of Trafalgar in the latter for which she is most well-known. The unsolved mystery of lost 19th century 'ghost ships' As Lord Nelson's flagship, HMS Victory served at the front of the battle on the Spanish coast. The Admiral was a hero of his day and well-respected for his strategic approach to battle. Despite having fewer ships than the Franco-Spanish fleet, Nelson managed to lead the British to triumph. However it was to be Nelson's last mission. He received a fatal hit by a lead ball on deck. He was taken below where he died. Voyage to bottom of the sea for Sir Francis Drake's remains . Only 20% of the vessel that stands today at Portsmouth, on England's south coast, is from the original ship. The structure of the 246-year-old warship still marvels modern day experts. ""It's a work of art,"" says O'Sullivan. He believes even nowadays ship builders would struggle to replicate parts of HMS Victory. Over the centuries she's undergone maintenance, but nothing of this magnitude. All of the outside of the hull will be re-planked, repairs will be made to the masts and work will be carried out on the interior. Teams have been preparing for the works since July, however over the next few weeks the project will step up a gear. Much of the restoration will be done by hand using traditional specialist skills, particularly when it comes to carving and shaping the wood. O'Sullivan hopes that throughout the project they'll be able to train up new apprentices so that the art of repairing these types of ships is not lost. Britain's Ministry of Defence has awarded the multi-million pound contract. While many would question why so much money is being invested into a project at a time of austerity in the UK, those close to the project believe it's essential to preserve something which is of so much importance to British and maritime history. ""We can't just leave it,"" says O'Sullivan. Such is the fragile nature of the ship, and because of its susceptibility to the elements, restoration must be carried out now or otherwise it will deteriorate. ""If we don't do the work, eventually we'll lose what we've got.""","HMS Victory is the world's oldest commissioned warship .

"Canadian radio host Jian Ghomeshi has interviewed some of pop culture's biggest names, from Barbra Streisand, Joni Mitchell and Dan Rather to Lena Dunham and Zach Galifianakis, and that's just in the past few months. His CBC Radio show, ""Q with Jian Ghomeshi,"" is one of the most popular in the network's history, making him a bona fide celebrity in a country that takes pride in its public radio. It aired on more than 180 public radio stations in the United States, prompting the Washington Post to call it ""the most popular new arts and culture radio show in America"" in 2013. Still, the 47-year-old was far from a household name in the United States when he posted a lengthy screed on his Facebook page Sunday accusing the CBC of firing him for his ""private sex life."" He said the dismissal came after he shared details of his sex life with his former employers to head off a smear campaign by ""jilted"" exes accusing him of nonconsensual kinky activity. The combination of Canadian celebrity, an iconic Canadian institution and allegations from anonymous women produced what one columnist called ""a Canadian sex scandal the likes of which we haven't seen in decades."" The size of Ghomeshi's star and the seriousness of the allegations makes this bigger than your run of the mill celebrity sex scandal, with implications beyond Canada. Two major issues reside at the heart of the scandal: a $55 million lawsuit against the CBC in which Ghomeshi alleges that he was fired for his sexual proclivities, and anonymous allegations reported by the Toronto Star from three women accusing Ghomeshi of sexual violence and nonconsensual BDSM activity. The CBC released a statement saying the decision was ""not made without serious deliberation and careful consideration"" and declined to comment further. Ghomeshi denies the allegations and says any sexual activity between him and the women, kinky or not, was consensual. ""Let me be the first to say that my tastes in the bedroom may not be palatable to some folks. They may be strange, enticing, weird, normal, or outright offensive to others,"" he said in his Facebook post. ""But that is my private life. That is my personal life. And no one, and certainly no employer, should have dominion over what people do consensually in their private life."" By bringing BDSM into the mix through his Facebook post, Ghomeshi ignited conversation in legal circles and the kink community over whether the ""kinky defense"" will prevail in his lawsuit and the court of public opinion. The scandal is of particular interest to the kink community, who say it raises two common topics of concern in their world: discrimination over sexual activity, and the gray area between consensual activity and assault in BDSM. Others worry about the potential for the ""kinky defense"" to be misappropriated and used as a shield for rape and assault. ""It hits on a lot of important aspects that BDSM faces,"" said Susan Wright, spokeswoman for National Coalition for Sexual Freedom, an advocacy group that promotes tolerance of sexual minorities. ""Rarely do you have an instance where so many things come together. 'Don't hate me for being kinky' In his Facebook post, Ghomeshi says he has always been interested in a variety of sexual activities but only those that ""are mutually agreed upon, consensual, and exciting for both partners."" He suggested that the coming days would bring allegations ""of unsavory aggressive acts in the bedroom"" with the implication that they happened ""nonconsensually."" ""And it will be based in lies but damage will be done,"" Ghomeshi said. His publicist declined to comment further, referring CNN to his Facebook post. Scores of fans have called for his reinstatement through online petitions to get him back on air. The kink community also has rallied to support Ghomeshi as one of their own, saying his plight drew attention to some of the more serious consequences the BDSM community faces for its lifestyle, particularly when it comes to job security, divorce proceedings and custody disputes. Polyamory: When three isn't a crowd . For others, it brought mainstream attention to ongoing ""difficult"" conversations within the kink community about how to deal with breaches of consent, Canadian writer and sex educator Andrea Zanin said. ""It's a twofold concern; it's important that we have conversations within the kink community about consent and negotiations and the reality that does happen within the kink community"" she said. ""At the same time we also need to constantly battle public perception of kink as being inherently abusive."" In a blog post that spread as the scandal unfolded, ""poor persecuted perv,"" Zanin cautioned against rallying around Ghomeshi or anyone who uses the ""kinky defense"" until all the facts are in. ""A danger inherent in this kind of media-message success is that the 'don't hate me for being kinky' defense will be used by people who perpetrate nonconsensual violence, and that we, as a community, will stand by uncritically -- or worse, cry out in support -- as victims of violence are once again silenced."" Zanin called it a ""major triumph"" for the kink community that Ghomeshi took a gamble on the ""consensual kink"" argument outweighing the ""you're a filthy pervert"" reaction in the court of public opinion. Regardless of the outcome, she hopes the mainstream remembers that it's not what people do behind closed doors that matters, but how they do it. ""Is everyone having fun and enjoying themselves? Is something in place to help catch them if they fall?"" she said. BDSM: A culture of consent . Responsible BDSM practitioners participate in what's called ""consent culture,"" where verbal discussion of boundaries and expectations are carefully negotiated ahead of time, said Noel Robertson, an Atlanta sex educator who leads talks about responsible BDSM. The conversation between the dominant and the submissive generally goes something like: What are you looking for out of this scene? What do you think I can supply you with? Is there anywhere I'm not allowed to touch you? Is there any level of nudity you are not comfortable with? Safe words are agreed upon to let the person know when to stop, whether they're stoplight colors or actual words. The bottom line: ""The person in the submissive position always has the right to use the safe word,"" she said. They can stop the scenario, no questions asked. ""If I have you bound and gagged and you can't use the safe word, I still have 100% responsibly to give you some way to say that's not OK,"" Robertson said. ""If I fail to do that and you can't tell me or if I can't understand, it is my failure, not yours."" As with any community, there are unscrupulous members who seek to exploit others, and survivors are not always treated with respect, she said. Case law in the United States says that consent is not a defense to assault where great bodily harm has occurred, said Wright, whose organization works with the BDSM community to report assault to police when it crosses the line. That's why breath-play (covering mouths, choking) and hitting with a closed fist can be risky, especially for people starting out, she said. Some educators recommend against those activities altogether. But consent to rough sexual activity that does not cause serious bodily harm is not assault, she said. ""People like intense physical sensations, they like extreme sports, and they like extreme sex,"" she said. ""They can play with each other and give each other intense sensations, but they can't seriously harm each other.""","The CBC has ended its relationship with popular radio host Jian Ghomeshi .

"If you don't get the job done at work, you won't get paid. But Congress plays by its own rules. Specifically, Congress hasn't passed a budget in almost four years. This is basic -- and required by law. Congress seems to think it's bigger than the law, however, which might help explain one recent poll that found it less popular than root canals, cockroaches and Donald Trump. That's why an act passed in the House on Wednesday deserves widespread support, as well as Senate passage. It's called ""No Budget, No Pay,"" and it means what it says. If members of Congress can't pass a budget on time, they wouldn't get paid until they did. Sadly, this low bar seems high. In fact, according to the Washington Post, Congress has passed spending bills on time only four times in the past 30 years. This is your money. And our elected representatives seem to have forgotten that presenting a stable plan on how to spend the money is a basic part of their job description. Instead, Washington has gotten used to living from continuing resolution to continuing resolution. This ain't the way it's supposed to be. In fact, it is a violation of the 1974 Budget Control Act (PDF). But somehow, breaking the laws they set for themselves doesn't seem to be an urgent concern to these Congresscrats, despite the fact that the U.S. government spent $3.7 trillion last year (PDF). The absence of a budget doesn't just violate common sense; there are real dollars and cents costs. Without a budget, it becomes difficult for government to make long-term spending decisions that affect us all. Now, House Republicans have seized on this idea as part of their bid to extend the debt ceiling deadline until mid-May.  To be clear, this is just kicking the can, but it's still a responsible step in the right direction. ""No Budget, No Pay"" was originally proposed by No Labels, a group of Democrats, Republicans and independents dedicated to the politics of problem-solving.  I helped found the citizens' group in 2010 with Mark McKinnon, Nancy Jacobson, Bill Galston, Lisa Borders, Kiki McLean, David Walker and many others. The proposal was the cornerstone of the ""Make Congress Work"" plan released last year. The idea was quickly adopted by Republican Dean Heller in the Senate and Democrat Jim Cooper in the House. But it met stiff resistance from other members of Congress who didn't like the idea of personal accountability for institutional dysfunction. Now, suddenly, after the election results of 2012, there is renewed interest in the idea, largely because it resonates with constituents as such a common sense proposal. ""No Budget, No Pay"" is a no-brainer. The proposal is getting support from more than the GOP House leadership.  A large number of centrist ""Blue Dog Democrats"" have announced their intention to vote for the measure, and the White House released a statement saying it would not try to oppose the measure because it would at least provide a ""short term solution to the debt limit."" According to the bill, if lawmakers didn't pass a budget by April 15, their pay would be docked and put in an escrow account until they found a way to work together on this front.  Not incidentally, that's also the reason ""No Budget, No Pay"" does not violate the 27th Amendment, which forbids salary increases or reductions during a current Congress: Their salary is not being reduced, it is being withheld until they actually do their job. Time and time again in this divided, dysfunctional Congress, we have seen partisan gridlock fall away only when members' self-interest is at stake. That's why we see the flurry of activity at the end of the year, when members of Congress want to get home for the holidays. Docking their pay would get their attention and focus their mind. Let me be clear: A long-term solution to the debt ceiling debacles still needs to be found. Congress is now the greatest single impediment to American economic recovery, in large part because a bloc of 50 or so votes on the far right seems enamored with playing chicken with our country's full faith and credit. The last time we went through this idiotic ideological exercise, America got its AAA credit rating downgraded. Standard and Poors stated the reason clearly: ""The effectiveness, stability, and predictability of American policymaking and political institutions have weakened at a time of ongoing fiscal and economic challenges."" But the House GOP vote to at least extend the debt-ceiling deadline and impose a common sense measure like ""No Budget, No Pay"" is sign of sanity at the start of the second Obama term. It will not solve all our problems, but at least by imposing a degree of personal accountability on members of Congress, it might encourage constructive cooperation instead of last-minute scrambles and hyperpartisan brinksmanship. If patriotic conscience can't compel Congress to work together, maybe requiring them to have some personal skin in the game will inspire them to do their job.","John Avlon: Most people who fail to do their jobs don't get paid .

"Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer became the new owner of the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday, concluding a public saga in which the league expelled one of the prior co-owners for racist comments. The sale marks the end of co-ownership by billionaire Donald Sterling, who was ousted from the NBA and then battled his estranged wife, Shelly, in a California probate court over control of the couple's trust, which owned the franchise. Sterling, 80, lost that legal battle when the probate judge ruled the deal by Shelly Sterling to sell the Clippers to Ballmer could move forward. Sterling bought the Clippers in 1981 for about $12 million and was the longest-tenured owner in the NBA. The negotiated $2 billion sale price is a record for any professional sports franchise in North America. Ballmer, 58, was ranked No. 35 this year on Forbes' annual world's billionaires list and has a net worth of $20 billion. Ballmer, players and coach Doc Rivers will meet fans Monday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles during the Clippers Fan Festival. ""I am humbled and honored to be the new owner of the Los Angeles Clippers,"" Ballmer said in a statement. ""Clipper fans are so amazing. They have remained fiercely loyal to our franchise through some extraordinary times. I will be hard core in giving the team, our great coach, staff and players the support they need to do their best work on the court."" Who is Steve Ballmer? In April, Sterling came under fire for making racist remarks against African-Americans in comments to his companion V. Stiviano. The recorded conversation was published online. In response, the NBA banned Sterling for life, fined him the maximum $2.5 million and moved toward terminating the Sterlings' ownership rights in the franchise. Under the sale, Ballmer agreed to give Shelly Sterling the title of ""owner emeritus"" of the team, allowing her to retain a connection to the franchise. ""I am thrilled that the Clippers now have such a wonderful new owner,"" Shelly Sterling said. ""I am confident that Steve will bring the city a championship team in the very near future. ... I cannot wait for the new season to begin."" The sale of the Clippers closed after ""the entry of an order by a California court confirming the authority of Shelly Sterling, on behalf of the Sterling Family Trust, to sell the team,"" the NBA said Tuesday. ""The NBA Board of Governors previously approved the sale and Ballmer is now the Clippers Governor,"" the basketball league said. Pierce O'Donnell, an attorney for Shelly Sterling, said Tuesday evening that he had filed court papers opposing Donald Sterling's petition to an appeals court  to direct the probate judge to vacate his order. He said the issue was moot because the family trust had received the $2 billion already. ""Donald Sterling's petitions are patently frivolous,"" he said. Ballmer's attorney, Adam Streisand, agreed the legal move would fail. ""I'm confident the appellate court will agree (California probate Judge Michael) Levanas made the correct decision, and it's all academic now, because we already have a new owner of the Clippers,"" Streisand said. Sterling and his attorneys couldn't be immediately reached for comment. On Ballmer's behalf, Streisand devised a legal strategy in probate court using ""a provision so rarely invoked that most probate attorneys were unaware of its existence before the Sterling case,"" his law firm said. That provision, called Section 1310(b), ""authorizes the probate court to make an order to permit a trustee to carry out a transaction even if the court's decision is appealed to a higher court if delay would cause irreparable injury or loss,"" Streisand's law firm said. ""When Ballmer contacted Streisand about the deal, Streisand says within 60 seconds he told Ballmer about 1310(b) and then presented the plan to lawyers for Shelly Sterling,"" the firm said. Shelly Sterling was able to negotiate a sale to Ballmer for $2 billion because her husband had OK'd in a letter her effort to negotiate with a buyer. But Donald Sterling later opposed a sale of the team, saying the purported letter authorized only a negotiation, not a formal sale. Shelly Sterling became the sole trustee of the couple's trust in May after two doctors determined that Donald Sterling was mentally incapacitated. He was diagnosed with early Alzheimer's or another brain disease. Sterling challenged his wife's takeover of the trust, but Levanas ruled in Shelly Sterling's favor, saying she acted properly in removing her husband from the trust that owned the NBA team. The judge further ruled that the sale could go forward regardless of appeals by Donald Sterling. Sterling has sued the league for $1 billion, claiming antitrust violations in its handling of the matter. He also is suing his wife and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, seeking monetary damages in civil court. Court documents filed by Sterling's attorneys call the potential deal ""unlawful"" and ""fraudulent"" and ask for an injunction to block the sale.

"Washington (CNN) -- A proposal to reduce nuclear weapons highlighted the debate within the German government about when and how to get rid of nuclear weapons on its soil, a new WikiLeaks document shows. Its release also reveals the presence of nuclear weapons in several European countries and Turkey, information not normally released by NATO. During a meeting with two U.S. diplomats, German National Security Adviser Christoph Heusgen expressed his reservations about the German government coalition's proposal to remove all tactical nuclear weapons from Germany, according to a November 2009 U.S. State Department cable published by WikiLeaks. In February, five countries -- Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, and Norway -- sent a joint letter to NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, signed by their respective foreign ministers, calling for a debate about NATO's nuclear policy. German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle has called for the removal of all nuclear weapons from German soil. However, Heusgen distanced the German government from the proposal they had signed onto, claiming that ""this had been forced upon them by FM Westerwelle,"" the cable said. Heusgen told the U.S. diplomats that ""from his perspective, it made no sense to unilaterally withdraw 'the 20' tactical nuclear weapons still in Germany while Russia maintains 'thousands' of them. It would only be worth it if both sides drew down,"" the U.S. cable said. U.S. Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs Philip H. Gordon responded by noting the importance of considering the potential consequences of a German proposal before moving forward. The cable continues, ""a withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Germany and perhaps from Belgium and the Netherlands could make it very difficult politically for Turkey to maintain its own stockpile, even though it was still convinced of the need to do so."" Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, says the cable shows the intense deliberations going on in the German political process. ""The new in that is that it shows the battle going on inside the German government between the foreign minister and other elements of the government on this issue of how to push this issue of tactical nuclear weapons within the alliance."" The Nuclear Threat Initiative defines tactical or nonstrategic nuclear weapons as ""short-range weapons"" which can include land-based missiles with a range of less than 500 kilometers (about 310 miles) and air- and sea-launched weapons with a range of less than 600 kilometers (about 370 miles). According to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, the United States has 500 tactical nuclear weapons in its arsenal, of which approximately 200 are deployed in Europe. The cable does not identify the origin of the nuclear weapons in any of the four countries, but the United States or NATO have military bases in all of them. According to Kristensen, these weapons are American. He points out that the British do not have tactical nuclear weapons, and the French keep their tactical nuclear weapons on their home soil. ""We don't comment on the placements of nuclear weapons,"" NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu told CNN. ""As a matter of policy, we don't comment on leaked confidential documents of any sort. We think diplomats should be able to talk to each other in confidence, because otherwise there is a risk that tensions can get out of control."" As for Heusgen's reference to ""the 20"" weapons on his country's soil, Kristensen says it is not clear whether he is actually confirming that amount of weapons, or if he is using the estimate in a report written by Kristensen in 2005, which was picked up by German media and government officials as part of the debate. ""Very few people in the German government know the exact number of weapons, and it's not clear to me that the national security adviser would know."" On the coupling of German and Russian denuclearization proposed by Heusgen, Kristensen says that would make very little sense. ""It would be very strange to see formal linking of very small number of weapons in Germany with the large inventory of tactical nuclear weapons Russia has in general. It's apples and oranges. Russian tactical nuclear weapons, their location and their mission is not linked to whether there are nuclear weapons in Germany."" Kristensen estimates that Belgium, Netherlands and Germany each have between 10 and 20 tactical nuclear weapons on their soil, and there are 60 to 70 in Turkey.","The German national security adviser is cool to a proposal to remove nukes from Germany .

"(CNN) -- When Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko visits Washington on Thursday, he will almost certainly again ask for U.S. military assistance, including defensive weapons. President Barack Obama should say yes. Arming Kiev can deter Russian Vladimir Putin from further aggression and support the fragile Ukraine ceasefire and settlement process. Doing so would also bolster U.S. efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. Russia illegally occupied and annexed Crimea in March. Just weeks later, armed separatists -- assisted and, in some cases, led by Russian intelligence officers -- began seizing government buildings in the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Ukrainian counterattacks started making headway in the summer. Russia responded by supplying heavy weapons to the separatists -- including, it is widely believed, the Buk anti-aircraft system believed to have shot down Malaysia Airlines flight 17 in mid-July. Despite the influx of arms, Ukrainian forces continued to make progress. By early August, the separatists looked on the verge of defeat. That would have stopped Putin's strategy in its tracks. So, as NATO noted, elite Russian military units invaded and occupied Ukrainian territory, hitting Ukrainian forces hard. Vastly outgunned, Poroshenko had little choice but to accept a ceasefire on September 5. The truce is shaky, but the Ukrainian president seems intent on pursuing a peaceful settlement. Whether common ground can be found among Kiev, the separatists and Moscow is unclear. At best, the negotiation will be long and arduous. The Ukrainian government has for some time sought lethal military assistance, such as anti-armor weapons, as well as secure communications equipment and reconnaissance drones. When he hosts Poroshenko in the Oval Office, Obama should agree to provide defensive arms on an expedited basis. Such assistance would enhance Kiev's ability to deter further Russian aggression, aggression that would threaten, perhaps fatally, the possibility of a negotiated settlement. A better-armed Ukrainian military would give Putin pause, because it could impose greater costs on the Russian army if the Russians break the ceasefire and renew the fighting. Reports detail the extraordinary lengths, such as nighttime burials, to which the Kremlin has gone to hide from its public the fact that Russian soldiers have fought and died in Ukraine. The more costly the Ukrainians can make any fighting for the Russians, the less Moscow's interest in resuming the conflict. Some may argue that providing lethal military assistance would provoke Putin to escalate. But he has already escalated the situation -- from instigating separatist actions to providing heavy weapons to sending in the Russian army. This suggests the opposite may well prove true: Arming Ukraine will raise the costs of escalation to Russia and thus make it less likely. Putin has made clear his contempt for the Western response to date. Inaction could embolden him to escalate in Ukraine and test the waters elsewhere, perhaps in a NATO member state such as Estonia. Moreover, the Ukrainians will bear the risks and brunt of any escalation. If they are willing to accept those risks, we should give them the tools to defend themselves. And there is an additional important reason to respond favorably to Ukraine's request for defensive arms: to restore credibility to the notion of security assurances. In December 1994, the leaders of the United States, Britain and Russia signed the Budapest memorandum on security assurances, which committed those countries to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and not use force against Ukraine. Those commitments paved the way for Kiev's decision to give up about 1,900 strategic nuclear warheads, at the time the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal. Moscow has grossly violated the Budapest memorandum by its seizure of Crimea and assaults on Ukraine. The United States and Britain have an obligation to respond. Washington has imposed economic sanctions on Russia and provided Ukraine a modest amount of nonlethal military aid. Those are appropriate steps, but they do not suffice. Last Friday, former President Leonid Kuchma, who signed the Budapest memorandum for Ukraine, suggested his country had been cheated. That reflects general sentiment in Kiev. The widely held impression that Moscow has violated its Budapest commitments at low cost badly weakens the value of security assurances in the future. That is unfortunate, as security assurances could play a role as part of the package to resolve the Iran and North Korea nuclear issues. But how much value will security assurances have if Tehran and Pyongyang see that they can be violated with relative impunity? Washington can change that impression. Providing lethal military assistance to Ukraine could not only deter Putin from further war against Ukraine, but could help to reestablish security assurances as part of the solution to critical nuclear proliferation challenges.","Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko visits Washington on Thursday .

"Members of Congress traveled to two Veterans Administration hospitals featured in a CNN report to visit the facilities and demand answers about why U.S. veterans needlessly died there. The congressional delegations led by Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller, R-Florida, visited the Dorn Veterans Administration Medical Center in Columbia, South Carolina, and the Charlie Norwood Medical Facility in Augusta, Georgia, after a CNN investigation that reported patients died as a result of delayed or denied care. Six deaths have been confirmed so far, and sources tell CNN the number of veterans who are dead or dying of cancer because they had to wait too long for diagnosis or treatment could be more than 20. Thousands of veterans were forced to wait months for simple screening tests like colonoscopies, and by the time they got diagnosed, it was too late. Hospital delays are killing America's war veterans . The wait lists for gastrointestinal appointments at the hospitals number in the thousands and go back as far as 2010. Both hospitals say the wait list issues have been resolved, but according to the visiting members of Congress, the VA still cannot explain why or who was responsible for the poor treatment of veterans. Rep. John Barrow, a Georgia Democrat whose district includes the Charlie Norwood VA center, said Congress has ""a duty to make sure that the veterans who serve get the best health care possible. And it is very obvious that for too long and for too many folks that hasn't happened."" Citing a lack of any disciplinary action and lack of ability to identify who at the VA caused the backlogs to exist, Barrow told reporters,  ""Our goal here today is to try to get to the bottom of what happened and to prevent this from ever happening again. What's important (is for) folks to understand this is just one step of a multistage affair to get to the bottom of what happened and to hold accountable those who were responsible."" The Veterans Affairs Committee has been looking into problems at VA medical centers for the past year and says the VA administration continues to stonewall and withhold information the congressmen believe is critical to understanding why the VA appears to be run so poorly.  The VA has also refused CNN's repeated requests to interview Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki or any other VA official on camera. VA hospital apologizes for deaths . Miller said the practice at the VA seems to be to hold no one accountable for errors, and instead transfer poorly performing executives and employees to other facilities instead of firing them. In an interview with CNN, Miller said he and his committee will continue to demand to know the names of those responsible and to demand disciplinary action.  ""That's why we asked the question again today ... tell us exactly who was disciplined and how.""  Miller said, ""I don't want to hear the excuse anymore that it was, 'well, it was multifaceted, there were many people involved.'... Well, if there were many people involved, then they all need to go."" Miller, who said he has been reluctant to make his investigations political, did say it is time the White House starts paying attention to the deteriorating treatment of the nation's veterans. He said he has been frustrated by a lack of cooperation from the Veterans Administration leadership, and that Shinseki has not paid enough attention to the medical problems at VA medical centers. Miller also said it is time President Obama pay as much attention to what is happening at VA medical centers as he does to what's happening in Washington or Hawaii, a reference to the president's recent vacation to his home state. ""It's time for him (Shinseki) to show some passion. And certainly it's time to show some passion from the President. I mean, the fact that we've had veterans who have died in the very facilities that are supposed to be taking care of them, and not by natural means, by means that could have been prevented, is egregious."" The congressman said his group has given the VA 30 days to respond to their requests for those answers.","Veterans Affairs Committee members visit VA facilities in Georgia, South Carolina .

"Virtual reality, the emerging 3D technology many expect to be the next quantum leap in the video gaming world, just got a little more real. Sony, makers of the top-selling PlayStation 4, has rolled out ""Project Morpheus,"" a virtual reality system it says will pair with its top-selling gaming console to immerse players in the virtual worlds in which they're playing. The system, announced Tuesday at the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, joins Oculus Rift, a similar full-immersion VR system that has captured the imaginations of gamers since its $2.4 million debut on Kickstarter in 2012. ""At (Sony Computer Entertainment), we view innovation as an opportunity to build on our mission to push the boundaries of play,"" said Shuhei Yoshida, president of SCE Worldwide Studios, at the conference.  ""Project Morpheus is the latest example of innovation from SCE, and we're looking forward to its continued development and the games that will be created as development kits get into the hands of content creators."" Virtual reality utilizes a headset that gives the wearer a 360-degree field of vision, allowing them to interact with their surroundings as if they were really there. Morpheus will feature a visor-style headset and interact with the camera on the Playstation 4 using sensors that track the player's head movements. Despite a multitude of other dramatic changes through the decades, the way console gamers have interacted with visuals has remained virtually  unchanged. The prospect of replacing the static, two-dimensional screen has many in the gaming world anxiously contemplating the possibilities. ""VR is exciting because it thoroughly immerses players in ways not possible on a regular TV set,"" said Dan ""Shoe"" Hsu, a longtime gaming journalist and editor-in-chief of GamesBeat. ""Wherever you turn your head, that's where you'll look, even if it's physically behind you. That sort of 360-degree immersion has never been done in a believable manner in the past, but the technology has caught up. We can now experience the same high graphical fidelity that we see on HDTVs within virtual reality now."" Sony did not announce a specific timetable or price details for Morpheus, saying models that will be made available to developers are prototypes. It all raises the question of whether top-tier game developers will be willing to make the considerable investment of time and resources it will take to create games for a new, untested system that will only be owned by some gamers who own one particular console. Hsu thinks Sony is in a good position, though. In just three-and-a-half months, the PlayStation 4 has sold more than 6 million units worldwide. ""Not every PS4 owner will buy it, of course,"" he said. ""But because Project Morpheus is essentially a new platform on its own, there will be plenty of developers who will want to be first or early on it. This is a chance for developers to plant their flags in a new market."" So, what does the arrival of Morpheus mean for Oculus? With Xbox-maker Microsoft also rumored to be working on its own headset, will the independent shop get squeezed by gaming's big names before it even hits the market? Don't count on it. For one, the Oculus Rift is designed to work, primarily, with PCs. So, even if the console makers each develop their own systems, there's plenty of space for the system to thrive despite the competition. And it's got plenty of momentum itself. Oculus has drummed up more than $90 million in funding and, in August, brought in legendary gaming developer John Carmack, the lead programmer behind classic games like ""Doom,"" ""Quake"" and ""Wolfenstein 3D,"" as chief technology officer. ""Oculus is still in a great position with its head start in development, both in hardware and software,"" Hsu said. ""Third-party games have been in the works for the Oculus Rift for quite some time now, so the company is in a good spot for when the headset releases."" The system got a profile boost at this month's South by Southwest Interactive festival, when it was used for a popular exhibit promoting HBO's ""Game of Thrones."" ""Competition is always, always good,"" Hsu said. ""If Sony's announcement forces Oculus to be even more aggressive in creating a top-notch VR unit and getting it to market more quickly, then the consumers will benefit.""","Sony announces ""Project Morpheus,"" a virtual-reality gaming system .

"Tamerlan Tsarnaev is telling no tales. The older of the two brothers who allegedly committed the Boston Marathon bombings was likely the one who planned the attack, but when he died in a shootout with police just days after the blasts, his thoughts and motivations vanished with him. But the brain that was home to his angry mind remains, and in this case that may mean something. Tsarnaev was an amateur boxer who won the New England Golden Gloves competition as recently as 2009 and 2010. That speaks to a young man with a healthy sense of discipline and focus, and if he had a violent streak, it was violence well-channeled. What we know about the suspects . But his sport of choice suggests the possibility of something else too: traumatic brain injury. As the National Football League and other pro sports increasingly reckon with the early dementia, mental health issues, suicides and even criminal behavior of former players, the risk of what's known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), is becoming clear. Roughly 4,000 former NFL players and 2,000 of their spouses are currently suing the league, claiming that the perils of head injuries were never explained to them and, indeed, that the players were pushed to get back on the field even when it was clear that they had suffered concussions. It was inevitable, then, that questions would be raised about whether Tsarnaev's brain may have been similarly traumatized during the years he boxed, and if there had indeed been damage, did that spark his alleged murderous behavior? The answer is a likely yes to the first part and a likely no to the second. TIME.com: Terrorists and mass shooters: More similar than we thought . Boxers are perhaps the best-studied victims of CTE, with the consequences of consistent trauma to the head described initially as ""punch drunk,"" but emerging as CTE in the 1950s, says Dr. Robert Stern, cofounder of the Boston University Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy. The term ""better describes a neurodegenerative disease caused, at least in part, by repetitive brain trauma,"" he says. The presence of CTE can only be confirmed postmortem, by looking for tau proteins in the brain -- produced when neural connections stretch and show signs of wear. Whether the presence of those proteins, however, play any role in behavior is less clear. In general, older people with CTE exhibit problems with memory, attention span and the ability to learn new material -- all of the things we associate with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. They may also exhibit impulsiveness, anger, situational explosiveness and paranoia, which are familiar as well to families of people suffering from dementia. In younger people, the predominance of the symptoms is frequently reversed: outbursts and lack of impulse control come first, with an underlying loss of cognitive abilities eventually following. And that's the problem with looking for CTE in Tarnaev. Authorities haven't revealed if they plan to examine his brain, and unless they have taken some necessary steps to preserve it for study, they may have lost that option already. But it may not matter. ""The Boston bombing was a planned attack,"" says Dr. Robert Cantu, also of Boston University and co-director of the Encephalopathy Center. ""There were lots of explosive devices put together in a very premeditated way. There was no flipping out here, no impulsiveness. That's not what you see with CTE in younger people."" That doesn't mean Tsarnaev didn't have brain trauma related to his boxing. ""I think he did,"" Cantu says. It's just that it may not have caused his alleged criminal behavior. TIME.com: Brother's keeper: Did older sibling lure brother into plot? That points to the difficulty of establishing any link between the condition of a brain and actions that may or may not result from it. Cantu points to the case of the late pro wrestler Chris Benoit, who killed his wife and son and then himself in 2007. When his brain was studied after he died, it showed signs of CTE-- but here, too, it might have had little to do with his murderous behavior. ""In Benoit's case the behavior was again premeditated. It took place slowly, over the course of a weekend. He even sedated his son first so he wouldn't suffer,"" Cantu says. Criminally pathological? Certainly. But triggered by CTE? Probably not. TIME.com: Brothers in arms: Sibling psychology and the bombing suspects . For now, there is no cure for CTE and the best treatment is prevention, which sports leagues from Pop Warner football on up are beginning to address with rules changes and more stringent medical monitoring of players. As my colleague Sean Gregory reported in January, investigators at UCLA have developed a still-experimental technique to detect CTE in the brains of living patients, using positron emission tomography (PET) scans and a radioactive dye that clings to tau proteins. Early diagnosis, if it becomes routine, could be used to keep already ill people away from contact sports and prevent their condition from being exacerbated by more hits. They might also be enrolled in treatment and therapy programs that would slow the onset of what for now are inevitable symptoms. While none of this likely would have deterred Tsarnaev from his alleged plot, it might be used to diagnose other people at risk of explosive CTE-related violence and stop them before they act out. By treating a single person's wounded brain, doctors could one day save uncounted other lives. This article was initially published on TIME.com.

"(CNN) -- One of two American journalists freed last year from a North Korean prison said Wednesday that their release was thanks to an expression of condolences made by former President Bill Clinton, to North Korea's reclusive leader Kim Jong Il. ""I tried to maintain hope as much as I could,"" journalist Laura Ling told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" of being sentenced to 12 years' hard labor along with fellow captive Euna Lee. The women were apprehended in March 2009 after crossing into North Korean territory while reporting from the border between North Korea and China for California-based Current Media. After being allowed unprecedented communication with her family in the United States, including four phone calls, Laura Ling was able to convey requests by her captors for a diplomatic rescue mission headed by Clinton. Laura Ling: Silence is an oath I can't keep . ""There was no deal,"" Ling said of their release in August 2009. ""What President Clinton said on the plane ride home was that Kim Jong Il told him, 'You were the first person who reached out to me when my father ... died, even before my allies. I've always remembered that and I've always respected you for that and I've always wanted to meet you.'"" Laura's sister, TV personality and journalist Lisa Ling, helped coordinate the effort for their release and said, ""I think what North Korea was trying to do was communicate these requests to me (through Laura), and they saw that we were actually executing what they wanted, and so they kept upping the ante"" ultimately asking for the envoy to be Clinton. The Ling sisters have written a book about the ordeal titled ""Somewhere Inside: One Sister's Captivity in North Korea and the Other's Fight to Bring Her Home."" The book hit stores Tuesday. Lee and Ling ended up spending 140 days in prison, but unlike other inmates, were allowed to receive and write letters to their families and make phone calls. ""I think that our ability to communicate really allowed North Korea and the United States to talk more directly,"" Lisa Ling said.

"""Star Wars"" fans have suggested new movie titles -- ""Star Wars episode VII: Attack of the Mouse"" -- and last minute Halloween costumes -- Jedi Mouseketeer for him and Disney Princess Leia for her -- since learning of the Walt Disney Co.'s $4 billion acquisition of Lucasfilm on Tuesday. But beyond the clever ""Star Wars""-Disney mashups, there appears to be a great deal of ambiguity surrounding the big merger and the announcement of ""Episode 7."" Targeted for release in 2015, ""Episode 7"" will kickoff a planned trilogy of live-action ""Star Wars"" films, to be released ""every two to three years,"" Disney said in a press release. Despite reports -- and the hopes of some passionate fans -- that George Lucas will simply serve as a consultant mapping out basic plotlines, we're not yet sure how involved the ""Star Wars"" creator and Lucasfilm founder will actually be in future installments. Though some fans are convinced that Lucas' involvement, or lack thereof, will affect ""Episode 7's"" ability to return ""Stars Wars"" to its pre-""Phantom Menace"" glory days. Social media goes wild over Disney + Star Wars . Since the prequel trilogy turned some fans off, ""Star Wars"" has introduced ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars,"" the successful animated series that airs on Cartoon Network; video games; comic books and toys. ""There's still a lot of rumbling discontent with the last three 'Star Wars' films and the way the franchise (has gone) over the last five/six years in particular,"" said Den of Geek editor Simon Brew. ""It's been pillaged to an extent."" However, he added, ""If you have an interest in 'Star Wars' on the big screen, than this is about as good a piece of news that's come through in the last 30 years."" Gawker's Drew Magary isn't sold. ""I don't think I'm alone in dreading the idea of paying another goddamn red cent for a 'Star Wars' movie ticket after Lucas made three terrible movies and went back to monkeyfart with the older, better ones, ruining them in the process,"" Magary wrote. ""Now the series is finally free from Lucas' ambling, simplistic vision."" There is a lot of criticism directed at Lucas. Some of it is deserved and some of it isn't, Brew said, adding that there's a sense that, by focusing on the business side more than the creative side, Lucas has ""been cheapening what he created."" Regardless, he says, the filmmaker's genius is palpable. That said, ""taking (the impending films) away from his control and cutting them fresh would be the more positive way forward. ... It got to the point where (Lucas) held 'Star Wars' back. ... There are so many new, interesting voices in science fiction,"" Brew said. He pointed to franchises like ""Batman"" and ""James Bond,"" which he believes have flourished thanks to new voices. Whether Disney is able to do with Lucasfilm what they've done with Pixar and Marvel, which earned more than $1 billion at the box office with this year's ""The Avengers,"" remains to be seen. But many fans agree that new screenwriters and a new director alone could aid the ""Star Wars"" universe. A dedicated fan and webmaster at TheForce.net and RebelScum.com, Philip Wise said he ""couldn't be happier"" about the news and Lucas' muted new role. ""The fans that care about the story a lot and the movies a lot are happy that (Lucas will) be creatively involved, and even more happy that he wont' be actively involved in the directing and maybe even the writing,"" he said. The potential for something great outweighs the potential for a train wreck at this point, Brew said. He noted Paramount's success with J.J. Abrams' ""Star Trek"" in 2009. (The sequel, ""Star Trek Into Darkness,"" is due out in May 2013.) The worst case scenario of bringing a new ""Star Wars"" trilogy to life, he added, is that we ""could end up pretty much where we already are, or halfway between the old films and the new films."" Gawker's Magary compared his love for the franchise to ""rooting for a sports team that never wins anything (or more accurately, a sports team that won three titles 30 years ago and hasn't won a game since)."" Disney knows how crucial ""Episode 7"" is, Brew said, specially with the promise of an additional two films in the bank. ""The potential at this point,"" he said, ""is as pure as it's been for awhile.""","On Tuesday, the Walt Disney Co. announced its $4 billion acquisition of Lucasfilm .

"The collective freak out you heard at 6:58 a.m. ET Tuesday morning was the cadre of Clinton followers reacting to an email from ""Hillary Rodham Clinton"" with the subject line ""Announcement."" After a few short heart palpitations (and reading the email), it became clear that the announcement was not the one many political watchers have been expecting for months: That the former secretary of state was running for president in 2016. Instead, the email urged supporters to donate to the foundation with the promise that ""Bill, Chelsea, and I will triple every $1 donated to the Clinton Foundation before the end of the year, up to an additional $100,000."" ""In my family, we're celebrating our first holidays with a beautiful new granddaughter,"" Clinton wrote in the email. ""We're also celebrating the generosity and commitment of our incredible Clinton Foundation family -- and that means you."" Clinton highlighted a number of her foundation's initiatives, including Too Small To Fail, a project dedicated to childhood education; No Ceilings, aimed at women and girls achieving full participation around the world; and Job One, an initiative aimed at connecting the unemployed with prospective employers. Hillary Clinton joined her husband's foundation a few months after leaving the state department in early 2013. With the addition of Clinton -- as well as her daughter Chelsea -- the foundation changed its named from the William J. Clinton Foundation to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. The addition proved positive. According to foundation tax documents released earlier this year, the foundation brought in $144.4 million in 2013, a three-fold growth from the $51.5 million the foundation received in 2012. The jump was seen as the foundation moving to up its endowment and put itself on better footing in case Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2016. Since joining the effort, Hillary Clinton has also used the foundation as a vehicle to travel the country and deliver high profile speeches.","Clinton supporters received an email from Hillary Clinton with the subject line ""Announcement""

"(CNN) -- I have a confession: I love Uber. And yes, I know the ride-sharing app has been under fire from critics for a host of reasons lately, most of them completely valid. This week, in just the latest high-profile incident, an Uber driver in New Delhi, India, was accused of raping a passenger who used the app to call a ride. In other instances, the $40 billion ""start-up"" has been accused of considering smear campaigns against its journalist critics, shaming women who accuse its drivers of sexism or assault, launching a blatantly sexist ad campaign that was reported to involve 20-minute free rides with attractive women in France, and, according to a CNN report, ordering thousands of rides from its competitor, Lyft, and then canceling them, in apparent attempt to hurt Lyft's business. But, confession: On Sunday, I took Uber to the airport in Atlanta. When I arrived in New York, I cursed the line of yellow taxis. Uber is faster, friendlier and cleaner. Above all: It's more convenient. And that, I've realized, is what drives morality in the digital age: convenience. If it's convenient to look past a company's questionable ethics, to avoid clicking those bad-story links in our Facebook feeds, then we do it. Because it's easy, and because publicly shaming companies, much less boycotting them, seems self-righteous and un-American in this age of runaway capitalism and gross inequality. That's not the way it should be, but it's happened. This isn't just about Uber. It's about Facebook, Google, Spotify -- I am listening to Spotify as I write this. And, yes, read about how the Swedish music-streaming service pays musicians basically nothing -- $0.007 per stream, according to a BBC report -- for their art. I used Google to find the aforementioned BBC article, and I wish that company didn't know everything about my digital life (read: life), but its services are so freaking convenient I can't quit them. This focus on convenience -- and a lacking public discussion about the moral and economic consequences of certain technological advances or, more to the point, the companies that are making billions by pushing forward those advances -- gives the tech sector incredible power over consumers that, to me, seems unprecedented. Meanwhile, many tech companies are providing services equivalent to those that, in another era, would have been managed or at least regulated by the government. Google is the new library, Uber the bus, Spotify the radio. They provide services we almost need to function in the modern world, but they have few competitors and come under little scrutiny from regulators and consumer watchdogs. So maybe it's time for tech consumers (read: me, you, everyone) to take more responsibility for our choices. Since I'm clearly deficient at making these decisions for myself, I turned for advice to Sarah Lacy, founder of the website PandoDaily and a vocal Uber critic. ""Tech companies like to say they have to be responsible citizens or people will vote with their feet. But it doesn't happen,"" she wrote in an e-mail that was delivered to me with the help of both Google and Microsoft. ""Despite three weeks of horrific scandals not a single person responsible has ever been fired from the company. There is no reason to think that if something even worse happens, the company will change or act in any way. And no reason to expect the board and investors will force them to. That scares me. Because this is escalating behavior and Uber hasn't yet found a line it can't cross."" No line it can't cross. These points are troubling, and they're not unlike those about clothing companies that do business in Bangladesh; or hotel chains owned by anti-gay sultanates. But those are easier to boycott. We're more dependent on tech. Uber should clean up its act -- improving its process for background checks worldwide; becoming more responsive to critics (i.e., not targeting them), dropping the sexist nonsense, and helping its drivers earn more money. The company has apologized for many of its transgressions. It issued a statement calling the alleged rape in India an ""abhorrent crime."" An executive, Emil Michael, said in a statement to Buzzfeed that his comments about the company potentially targeting journalists were made at a private dinner but also ""were wrong no matter the circumstance."" And it reportedly pulled its site about the sexist French ad. A company blog post published December 4 indicates Uber ""will be making changes in the months ahead."" ""Done right,"" the company says, ""it will lead to a smarter and more humble company that sets new standards in data privacy, gives back more to the cities we serve and defines and refines our company culture effectively."" Ensuring changes are ""done right"" will take public pressure. But what kind? Lacy has deleted Uber from her phone, both because of the statement it sends and because she fears for her safety when using the service. I'm considering the same, and did download Lyft this afternoon. But here's a confession I know is both shameful and very 2014 America: I'd still like a protest that's more convenient.","John Sutter says Uber is causing a moral quandary for riders .
This is the age when convenience trumps morality, he writes ."

"(CNN) -- Today, President Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev signed a treaty fixing a ceiling for each country of 1,550 nuclear warheads and 700 deployed nuclear delivery vehicles. The new limits are about a third lower than the previous ones negotiated by George W. Bush in the 2002 Moscow Treaty of 2,200 per side. Some are impressed. Now that the new treaty is signed, it will be against the law for a president to deploy 1,600 warheads -- unless he first withdraws from the treaty. But a new ""counting rule"" undercuts the significance of Obama and Medvedev's achievement. Each bomber counts as only one warhead, even though each might be able to carry as many as 20 warheads. America's premiere independent expert on the American nuclear arsenal, Hans Kristensen, of the Federation of Atomic Scientists, said ""The paradox is that with the ""fake"" bomber counting rule, the United States and Russia could, if they chose, deploy more strategic warheads under the New START Treaty by 2017 than would have been allowed by the Moscow Treaty by 2012."" On the other hand, almost all arms-control advocates acclaim the new inspection procedures, which lay a strong foundation for future treaties. The Moscow Treaty, by contrast, virtually did away with inspections. It seemed designed to cancel hopes for any future for arms control. Debates about the size of the cuts are certainly worth having. But they distract from a glaring reality contained in the treaty that is more important and in many ways more surprising. The treaty does cut a few hundred warheads, but at the same time it sanctions and, so to speak, blesses, many more -- namely the 1,550 that are permitted. This hard fact points to a startling truth: Every decade or so, Washington and Moscow sit down and jointly decide that they would like to go on holding one another hostage to mutual annihilation by nuclear arms. They ratify the balance of nuclear terror born in the Cold War. Why? During the Cold War, no one had to ask. The two superpowers were involved in a global confrontation. But once the Cold War and the USSR ended, the arrangement became downright weird. Was there something in the wary U.S.-Russia friendship of the 1990s or the mild rivalry of the new century that warranted threats of mutual annihilation? The question is almost never asked. Certainly, it has never been adequately answered. Does anyone in the United States want to be in the cross hairs of thousands of Russian nuclear weapons? Do we want to thus target Russians? Who would answer ""yes"" to either question? The geopolitical revolution of 1989-1991 had no visible effect on the strategic precincts where the number of deaths in a nuclear war are reckoned. The two arsenals, and the arms control agreements that went with them, sailed on into the new era disconnected from political goals or realities. War, some say, is politics conducted by other means. But what is this? True, each time the negotiating teams have met, the cuts have been substantial. At the height of the Cold War, the two countries jointly possessed some 70,000 warheads. Now we're down to some 20,000. (The difference from the 1,550 figure for each side is accounted for by warheads held in storage). Two cheers for that! But the Cold War figures were so high that the United States and Russia could cut warheads by the hundred or by the thousand for decades and still be capable of wiping each other out many times over. Consider the 1,550, for example. One hundred warheads used against the hundred largest cities of either country would spell the effectual end of that country. That means that the current figure leaves a factor of overkill of at least 15 -- and more if the thousands of stored warheads are counted. The cut of a few hundred warheads is a success. But the survival, 20 years after the end of the Cold War, of the 1,550 that each country still points at the other is a gross failure that outweighs it by far. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jonathan Schell .","Jonathan Schell says U.S.-Russia treaty lowers ceiling for each country's nuclear arsenals .
But ""counting rule"" undercuts new limits, theoretically allows more weapons, he says .
Cuts are welcome, he says, but why continue balance of terror long after Cold War's end?
Schell: Existence of thousands of nukes is failure that outweighs treaty's acheivement ."
"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday signed into law a last-minute compromise plan to raise the nation's $14.3 trillion debt ceiling, narrowly averting what could have been an unprecedented default with calamitous economic consequences. Obama's signature capped a tumultuous negotiation with congressional leaders that spanned months before finally coming up with an agreement on Sunday, two days before the government said it would run short of money pay its bills while lacking the authority to borrow any more. On Monday, the U.S. House passed the compromise measure by a 269-161 vote, overcoming opposition from unhappy liberal Democrats and tea party Republicans. Then the Senate passed the plan, which imposes sweeping new spending cuts over the next decade, on a 74-26 vote on Tuesday afternoon. Shortly afterward, Obama praised the deal as ""an important first step for ensuring that as a nation we live within our means."" But the American economy ""didn't need Washington to come along with a manufactured crisis,"" the president noted.  ""It's pretty likely that the uncertainty surrounding the raising of the debt ceiling -- for both businesses and consumers -- has been unsettling, and just one more impediment to the full recovery that we need.  And it was something that we could have avoided entirely."" ""Voters may have chosen divided government, but they sure didn't vote for dysfunctional government,"" the president said. He signed the deal into law less than an hour later. If the debt ceiling had not been increased before the end of Tuesday, Americans could have seen rapidly rising interest rates, a falling dollar and shakier financial markets, among other problems, because the government would have been unable to borrow more money to account for the difference between revenue it collects and bills it owes. Regardless, the federal government could still face a credit rating downgrade. Credit rating agency Moody's said Tuesday the United States will keep its sterling AAA credit rating for the time being, but lowered its outlook on U.S. debt to ""negative."" A ""negative outlook"" indicates the possibility that Moody's would downgrade the country's sovereign credit rating within a year or two. Final passage and signing of the debt ceiling agreement didn't impress Wall Street, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping for an eighth straight day. The agreement reached Sunday by Obama and congressional leaders from both parties calls for up to $2.4 trillion in savings over the next decade, raises the debt ceiling through the end of 2012 and establishes a special congressional committee to recommend long-term fiscal reforms. Emotions ran high during the final debates on Capitol Hill. Numerous Republicans remained worried about cuts in defense spending and the lack of a required balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Progressive Democrats were livid over the extent of the deal's domestic spending cuts, as well as the absence of any immediate tax hikes on high-income Americans. ""On this matter, my conscience is conflicted,"" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, said Tuesday morning.  ""If we should default on our debt, terrible things will ensue."" But if ""we continue to move toward more and more spending cuts, we will literally disadvantage the poor and working families of America to the advantage of those who are well off,"" Durbin said. Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Illinois, praised the agreement as ""a down payment on further ways to bring common sense ... to the spending of our government,"" ""If we fail, we deliver a free people into the hands of financial bondage,"" he warned. Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut who is part of the Democratic caucus, called the deal a first step in ""a long, hard march back to fiscal responsibility in our country."" ""Nobody seems perfectly satisfied with it, but that's inevitable,"" Lieberman said.  ""For me, the positive outweighs the negative."" GOP leaders sold the deal to skeptical rank-and-file Republicans in recent days by arguing that it will finally begin the process of reforming spending and taming the growing debt, a key goal of conservatives who fueled the GOP takeover of the House in last year's midterm elections. Top Democrats have focused on the fact that the bill preserves benefits from popular entitlement programs such as Medicare and takes the politically problematic debt ceiling issue off the table until 2013. In the end, the majority of both Democrats and Republicans supported the legislation in the Senate. In the House, Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, was able to round up the support of most of his GOP caucus, while the chamber's two top Democrats -- Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland -- voted for the plan along with more than 90 of their caucus members. One of those supporting the plan was Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, who cast her first House vote since being shot in the head in an assassination attempt in January. She received an emotional ovation when she entered the chamber. In an op-ed to be published Wednesday in the Washington Post, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner argued that the process of forging the agreement was terrible, but the result is good. ""The agreement creates room for the private sector to continue to grow, without the threat of default and the burden of higher interest rates,"" Geithner wrote, noting the measure passed Tuesday locks in at least $2 trillion in long-term savings that are ""phased in gradually to avoid hurting the economy in the near term."" Referring to the pressure exerted by tea party conservatives in the House on the negotiating process, Geithner also wrote that because the agreement allows the debt ceiling to be extended through 2012, ""it should not be possible for a small minority to threaten catastrophe if the rest of the government decides not to embrace an extreme agenda of austerity and the dismantling of programs for the elderly and the less fortunate."" The agreement revolves around a two-stage process. The first stage includes $917 billion in savings, including a roughly $420 billion reduction in the national security budget. The cuts will be accompanied by a $900 billion increase in the debt ceiling. Because of the need to immediately increase borrowing, Obama has immediate authority to raise the debt ceiling by $400 billion, which will last through September. The other $500 billion increase in the debt limit is subject to a congressional vote of disapproval that can be vetoed by the president. In the second stage, a special joint committee of Congress will recommend further deficit reduction steps totaling $1.5 trillion or more, with Congress obligated to vote on the panel's proposals by the end of the year. The committee will comprise 12 members, six from each chamber, equally divided between Democrats and Republicans. The panel's recommendations are due by November 23 and are guaranteed an up-or-down vote without amendments by December 23. The committee is expected to consider politically sensitive reforms to the tax code and entitlement programs, though Democrats and Republicans disagree on the likelihood of any eventual revenue increases. If the committee's recommendations are enacted, Obama will be authorized to increase the debt ceiling by up to $1.5 trillion. If the recommendations are not enacted, Obama can still raise the debt ceiling by $1.2 trillion. At that point, however, a budget ""trigger"" will kick in, imposing mandatory across-the-board spending cuts matching the size of the debt ceiling increase. The cuts would be split between defense spending and non-defense programs, an unpopular formula intended to motivate legislators to approve the committee's recommendations. ""You want to make it hard for (lawmakers) just to walk away and wash their hands,"" Gene Sperling, the director of Obama's National Economic Council, said Sunday. ""You want them to say, if nothing happens, there will be a very tough degree of pain that will take place."" The final debt ceiling increase in the agreement is also subject to a congressional vote of disapproval that can be vetoed by Obama. The agreement calls for both houses of Congress to vote on a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, though it does not make a further increase in the debt limit subject to congressional passage of such an amendment -- something tea party conservatives were initially demanding. Leaders on both sides of the aisle have openly conceded that the deal is far from perfect. ""Neither side got what they wanted,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Tuesday.  ""Each side laments some of the things we had to give up, but that's the way it is."" A new CNN/ORC International Poll shows that only 44% of Americans approve of the debt ceiling deal, while 52% disapprove. According to the Monday survey, Republicans dislike the fact that the deal raises the debt ceiling through 2013, while Democrats dislike the lack of any tax increases on businesses or higher-income Americans. Only 17% of Americans believe that their elected officials have behaved like ""responsible adults"" during the debt ceiling debate, while 77% believe they have acted like ""spoiled children."" ""I think all of us need to reflect on how these institutions are conducting themselves, how members are conducting themselves,"" said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-North Dakota, who has announced he is not seeking re-election next year. ""We need to think about why are we really here.  We're here to solve problems.  We're not here to worry about the next election, and unfortunately there's too much focus on pure partisan politics and not enough focus on solving problems confronting the country."" CNN's Ted Barrett, Kate Bolduan, Gloria Borger, Keating Holland, Brianna Keilar, Jeanne Sahadi, Xuan Thai, Jessica Yellin, Athena Jones, Lisa Desjardins, Dan Lothian and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","NEW: Geithner calls the deal a good result of a terrible process .

"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton's book tour resembled the roll out of a new brand, and from my standpoint as a marketer, it looked like a big one handled badly. If, as many suspect, she is running for president in 2016, she blew the perfect opportunity to present herself as the new Hillary Clinton. In her launch moment, she proved to be so inwardly focused on herself, she missed giving people the emotional release they've been waiting for: to see what's new with her and to be excited about the possibility of her being in the field again as a candidate. Two cases in point; her statement to Diane Sawyer that the Clintons were ""dead broke"" upon leaving the White House and her interview with The Guardian suggesting that voters won't see her as part of the inequality problem and will gladly accept the Clintons' net worth of $100M+ because they pay ""ordinary income taxes."" This may just be too tone deaf and move her dangerously close to the edge of voter exasperation. Clinton's big miss is that what could have been a moon shot moment for her brand (that's why they're called ""launches"" and why advertisers spend millions on the Super Bowl) may fizzle into HRC fatigue. She is amazingly qualified but risks being a brand failure. There are several other indicators of a launch gone awry. Book sales in the first week were only one sixth of what they were for her earlier, and very successful, memoir. Commentators from across the spectrum have criticized her public appearances. A Quinnipiac poll released Monday seems to show Clinton's lead over Christie drooping in Iowa. Today, her husband Bill Clinton even had to step in on her behalf, defending his wife's response to a query about their wealth. But he had to acknowledge the missteps, noting hers was ""not the most adept answer to a question."" Evidence that this book tour needed to relaunch Clinton can be found in a recent WSJ/NBC survey: 55% people rate her as competent, but 60% don't see her as likable and 62% don't regard her as trustworthy. That's a perceptual trend among voters that hasn't changed much since 2008. The book tour should have been planned to replace the old news about Hillary, with new, inspiring ways to imagine she could lead. By contrast, one of the most successful impresarios of product launches, Steve Jobs, built them into spectacles. He protected the run-up to an announcement like a classified national security secret and then unleashed the event with maximum impact to create brand momentum for Apple over time. Every launch was a new reason to be loyal to Apple, an even better argument for me to be in love. She, instead, leaves us frustrated with important questions unanswered: Will she or won't she run? Does she have the fire? Does she have a vision for her candidacy? Why is she doing the tour now, so far ahead of 2016? How has she changed? Does she know that people often can't get underneath her thick crust? Who is she, anyway? We watch her still back on her heels after all these years. It's not just the trust and likability issues. It's also calling out the woman-under-scrutiny card with Diane Sawyer: ""You know you're being judged,"" she said. Well, some say, of course you're being judged, that's the point of all this! It is Clinton's inward focus that keeps her from connecting and understanding the world in terms other than hers: Clinton has always been about her. Her accomplishments, her slights, her victories. She has always had a hard time connecting her ""her-ness"" to us. That makes it very hard for her to establish why she's relevant to our lives. She seems to refuse to deal with what voters most want to know: What's in it for me? Maybe voters today like more the idea of what Clinton represents, the first women presidential contender, than who she actually is. And her inability to connect with people could create an opening for someone else to come in and steal her thunder as the first woman presidential contender. Elizabeth Warren, anyone? Harvard professor and researcher Amy J.C. Cuddy finds that leaders influence and persuade best when they connect to people first with warmth, followed with competency. Clinton doesn't fit into this paradigm at all: She leads with competency and, according to polls like the WSJ/NBC survey, displays little apparent warmth. Successful launches are all about timing and sustained impact. Clinton should have kept the book tour bottled up until she was ready to declare for president because, down the road, we won't believe again that she's coming out to us as new. Consumers -- and competitors -- stick to this pattern and rarely give a brand in business a second chance to be new. A notable exception is Apple, which was veering dangerously close to bankruptcy in 1997, its stock at a low of $6. In 2012, Apple's stock price was over $700 (before a recent 7-for-1 stock split) and the company was stronger than ever, standing on the shoulders of many successful launches for the brand over the course of 15 years. There are examples of companies that have made old brands successful after numerous attempts that didn't succeed (Old Spice, J. Crew, Burberry, Harley-Davidson, Walmart, UPS). But it's hard to find a successful brand that came back after a really bad roll out, proving the point that if you blow it as a brand in a big product launch, you're really at risk. As a brand, Clinton will always be a rational purchase for voters, not an emotional one. Like a functional Buick that gets you through the snow, is good on gas and always runs, Clinton's brand has real value. But as she learned in 2008, you have to explain to your friends why a functional Buick is better than a glamorous Porsche. The good news for Clinton is that politics, unlike business, can be forgiving. After all, she is married to The Comeback Kid. Even so, she has paid a price for the roll out: She seems less inevitable than two weeks ago.","Martha Pease: Hillary Clinton's book rollout has been criticized .

"(CNN) -- First, let's be clear: No one can blame voters if they a) are turned off by this election, b) are worried more about other things in their lives and c) don't think that it matters much who controls the Senate, which is what is up for grabs this year. I mean, who could be inspired by Kentucky Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes as she refuses to say whether she voted for President Obama, citing her constitutional right to privacy. (As a public candidate for public office, no less.) And then there's her opponent, Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, who is so eager to win re-election (and possibly lead a Senate majority) that while calling for the repeal of Obamacare, he also says that the Kentucky health care exchange—which is working well—could continue. ""I think it's fine to have a website,"" he allowed. Huh? So OK, I get that, to a degree, this is a Seinfeld election, a show about nothing. Except for this: When the show is over, and if control of the Senate changes to the Republicans, it could matter. Not in the suddenly-we-are-all-going-to-work-together kind of way. But rather, in the it's-in-my-self-interest-to-get-something-done kind of way. Without being too Pollyannish, let me posit this: If there is unified Republican control of the legislative branch, Republicans would be smart to do some much-needed repair work on the brand. This is not an argument for voting for Republicans; it's a possible route out of the gridlock. Right now, too many voters see the GOP as just the party of stopping stuff, not inventing stuff. In a midterm election, that can work: Obama is unpopular, tie all candidates to Obama. Bingo, Senate majority. But if Republicans take charge of the Congress, they will have run out of excuses. And they will have the opportunity to say, hey, it wasn't us bollixing up the works. It was Harry Reid. Ah, you say, but what about President Obama? He's got a legacy to think about, and he'll be thinking about it, you can be sure. He's got as much self-interest here as does the GOP brand: He came into the White House with a vision of a transformational presidency. He's now all about issuing executive actions. That's not what he really wants, either. The issue that comes to mind, of course, is immigration reform—which has been hanging out there so long it just gets messier and messier. The governing conundrum is outlined perfectly in The New York Times Upshot analysis: In order to keep their House majority, congressional Republicans don't need Hispanic votes. Not one. And Hispanics are conspicuously underrepresented as voters in most of the pivotal Senate races of 2014, excepting Colorado. But if the GOP actually wants to win a presidential election, author Nate Cohn writes, ""the Republicans will need a substantial number of Hispanic votes."" All of which means that, at a certain point, GOP leaders need to decide one thing: Do they want to remain a congressional party? Or would they actually like to become a presidential party once again? If they do something—and get the issue off the front burner—they might actually have a shot at it. Their biggest burden: convince the recalcitrant, self-interested, hell-no rank-and-filers to actually get something done. For the party. And, by the way, for the country. There's one logic that rules midterm elections--in which GOP candidates have political reasons to rail against immigration reform. Then there's another logic that takes hold when you try to set the table for a presidential candidate, and campaign—no matter what some party diehards argue. Presidential elections are about big things. Parties—and candidates—that shrink from solutions seem small, unworthy. Sure, it depends on the GOP candidate. (As in: Chris Christie or Ted Cruz?) And it also depends on President Obama. What can he accept as a compromise? Would he be willing to accept a measure that provides some sort of secure legal status rather than a complete path to citizenship? And how would Democrats react to that? Lots of unknowns, of course. And one of the biggest is whether Republicans—after more than four years out of the White House—have learned how tough it is to run the country from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. If they haven't figured that out, then the cynicism will be warranted. This election won't matter.","Gloria Borger says some argue this year's election is about nothing .

"Oscar-nominated Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou has been fined 7.48 million yuan ($1.2 million) for breaching China's one-child policy, authorities say. A letter sent to Zhang by the family planning bureau of Binhu District of Wuxi City, Jiangsu province in eastern China on Thursday demanded that he pay a penalty for having two ""beyond-the-quota"" children. The letter was posted on the district's official account on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter-like microblogging service. The fine comes after Zhang apologized in an open letter for his ""excessive children"" in December. He and his wife, Chen Ting, admitted to having two sons and a daughter. ""As a film director, it takes a lot of efforts and good movies for people to remember you, but having excessive children had ruined it all,"" he said, according to Xinhua, China's state news agency. ""I sincerely apologize to everyone on my 'excessive children' case. I admit it's my mistake and I won't blame others for it."" ""I will learn my lessons, and I'm willing to cooperate with any investigation from family planning commission,"" Zhang said. Local officials in Jiangsu province calculated the fine based on the couple's combined annual income, the document stated. Nine investigation teams had been sent to ""collect evidence"" since November. The couple have to pay the fine within 30 days of receiving the letter, local authorities added. Zhang's case comes after China adopted new rules to ease its one-child policy in December. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed a resolution to allow couples to have two children if one of the parents was an only child, according to Xinhua. Previously, a couple was only allowed a second child if both of them were only children. However, Zhang, best known for movies such as ""Red Sorghum,"" ""Raise the Red Lantern,"" and ""Hero,"" is unlikely to benefit from the change. Zhang's breach of the policy has set off a firestorm, especially among some netizens who resent how the rich and famous in China flout rules and policies. ""Is this really a huge sum? Do you people know how much he makes from a single film? Some are saying that the fines are too heavy. All I can say is that this is nothing to him,"" Sina Weibo user__729_ wrote on China's equivalent of Twitter. But Zhang also had his defenders. ""Zhang is a good fellow,"" wrote Sarah2007 on Sina Weibo. ""Even though the social maintenance fee is a ridiculous and shameless rip off, which no one knows what use it will be put to, he knows he has no choice, as a public figure, but to accept the fines with a with an earnest attitude.""

"At least 22 people have been killed in three separate attacks in northeastern Nigeria since Friday, including 15 Christians shot Sunday inside a church, according to officials. The violence began early Friday when unidentified gunmen raided a village in Musari, in Borno state, killing five people, said Joint Task Force Lt. Col. Sagir Musa. JTF troops responded, and a gunbattle ensued. Three of the attackers were killed, and troops recovered weapons and ammunition. Musa declined to provide further details of the attack. Also Friday, gunmen with suspected ties to the Islamist militant group Boko Haram killed two people and wounded another in an attack in Maiha, in Adamawa state, according to Godfrey Okeke, Adamawa state commissioner. The attackers freed 35 inmates from the Maiha prison and set government buildings on fire, Okeke said. In Sunday's attack, gunmen entered a church in Chibok, also in Borno state, and killed at least 15 worshipers, said Mohammed Kana, a regional official for the National Emergency Management Agency. ""Some of the people had their throats slit,"" Kana said, citing NEMA staff who responded to the scene. Sunday's violence comes six days after attackers raided two churches during Christmas Eve services, killing 12 people. Read more: 12 killed in attacks on two churches in Nigeria . In October, a report from Human Rights Watch addressed the violence plaguing northern Nigeria, particularly from Boko Haram. The group's name means ""Western education is forbidden.""

"PARIS, France (CNN)  -- The chief of the French army resigned Tuesday after an accidental shooting at a military open house that left 17 people wounded. French Chief of Army Staff General Bruno Cuche salutes during a welcome ceremony in India. President Nicolas Sarkozy has accepted the resignation of Gen. Bruno Cuche, the Elysee said in a statement on its Web site. ""The president ... as he has already stated, is closely following the various investigations now under way,"" the statement from Sarkozy's office said. Seventeen people, including some children, were wounded by live bullets Sunday as a commando parachute infantry regiment demonstrated a hostage extraction exercise at a military open house in Carcassonne, France, in the country's southwest, according to the French military's Web site. The soldiers in the demonstration were supposed to be using blanks, but one soldier shot live rounds that remained in his weapon after shooting drills, according to the French newspaper Le Figaro. That soldier was suspended Tuesday and will appear before a judge later in the day, the newspaper said. Defense Minister Herve Morin has called for a probe scrutinizing the procedures and rules governing the use of ammunition and the security provisions taken during public demonstrations of military exercises, a statement on his Web site said. He also called for an immediate suspension of the use of blanks in any public military demonstration. Brice Robin, prosecutor for Montpellier, said the shooting seemed unintended and that the soldier appeared to ""have made a mistake while loading his gun,"" The associated Press reported. .""This act was absolutely not premeditated; I want to be clear about this point,"" the agency reported Robin as saying.","French president accepts resignation of the chief of the French army .

"The Nintendo Wii U has seen its star dim somewhat since its launch in November 2012. Worldwide sales numbers for the console have been disappointing and some gamers have complained that the number of desirable games for the system hasn't grown quickly enough. However, the man who brought to life Nintendo legends like Mario, Link and Donkey Kong is preaching patience with the console, saying the Wii U, with its touchscreen controller that augments big-screen play, is so different that it will take time for people to understand its real value. Shigeru Miyamoto is Nintendo's most successful video game designer, creating some of the world's most popular franchises with ""Donkey Kong,"" ""Super Mario Bros.,"" ""The Legend of Zelda"" and ""Pikmin"" before eventually turning his attention to the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. Through a translator, Miyamoto told CNN.com that having a second screen for gaming in the living room is a new experience for gamers. He said the touchscreen interface with the Wii U Gamepad controller, combined with the main-screen action on a television, opens up options that have never been possible. ""The challenge that we had was if someone wanted to view television, then you couldn't play games. We wanted to have a second screen for Wii U that would make it possible for people to essentially play games even if something else was on the TV,"" Miyamoto said. Skepticism about the Wii U sounds familiar, Miyamoto said. When Nintendo released its now-popular handheld DS portable gaming system in 2004, lots of early reviews predicted it would fail. ""There was a period when we first released the Nintendo DS that people would say there's no way people can look at two screens at once,"" he said. ""I almost feel like, as people get more familiar with Wii U and these touchscreen interfaces, that there is going to come a point where they feel like 'I can't do everything I want to do if I don't have a second screen'."" Review: Nintendo Wii U -- a tale of two screens . With the inclusion of nongaming apps for the Wii U, the gaming console appears to be positioning itself as a hub for more than just games. Netflix, Skype and Nintendo TV apps all point to offering more variety in entertainment without having to change devices. Miyamoto said that while the Wii U does offer more choices for families, it doesn't necessarily need to be the center of entertainment. ""I feel a device like Wii U, with its ability to continue to offer new features and that network connection and the connection to the TV and the interface, really makes it feel that it's more than just a game machine, but something that offers a lot of practical use and practical purpose in the living room,"" he said. ""I look at it as being a very useful device that can do many different things and therefore really seems to be the device that's ideal to have in the living room."" Problems with updates and console crashes plagued the Wii U early on. Miyamoto agrees there is room for improvement in some facets of the Wii U, but points out that Nintendo is working on solutions sooner rather than later. ""Our immediate objective over the next few months is to improve the Wii U system and make it a little more stable, a little bit more convenient to use from a system standpoint,"" Miyamoto said. ""Miiverse (a sort of social network that lets players interact) is an example of an ongoing project. We really wanted to be able to leverage Miiverse in something like 'New Super Mario Bros. U.' We're obviously still early on in it and just trying things out, but so far, it does feel like the community itself is doing a very good job of being a warm and welcoming place for people."" ""The other thing I think about is how do we begin getting people to understand that and convey the usefulness of Wii U to them. For me as a game developer, obviously I look at Wii U from the perspective of what games I can bring to Wii U."" In the short term, Miyamoto said ""Pikmin 3"" and ""The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker"" will be released for the Wii U and other games that bring a Nintendo-esque style of play will also be released later this year. Nintendo announced 2013 as the Year of Luigi and plans to release several games featuring Mario's little brother prominently. It also happens to be the 30th year since Luigi first appeared in the original ""Mario Bros."" arcade game. ""Luigi Mansion: Dark Moon"" for the Nintendo 3DS is the first of these titles to highlight the timid plumber. Miyamoto said he wanted to display how different Luigi is from Mario while at the same time upgrading the first GameCube game with a second screen. ""The original GameCube game was sort of a mix -- these ghost events and exploration of the mansion,"" Miyamoto said. ""But with the map there now (on the second screen) and to always see the map as you are exploring, the exploration feature and really exploring the mansion itself takes on a much bigger role in this game."" He also let slip that another historic character will be making an appearance in the game. ""Toad (a recurring Mario franchise character) does make some appearances. Maybe I'm not supposed to say that. (laughs) It's going to be very fun when Toad appears."" When looking to the future of the video games industry, Miyamoto sees the promise of continued success. He points out that video games are now something everyone expects to exist instead of just a phase or fad of entertainment. ""The fact that we've reached an age where video games are being received the way they are just makes me very grateful,"" Miyamoto said. ""There was a time when people always asked, when is the video game boom going to end? We've reached a stage where there's no longer a question of when the boom's going to end. ""It is simply: there are video games.""","Shigeru Miyamoto designed ""Super Mario Bros."" and other top Nintendo games .
Miyamoto says skepticism about the Wii U reminds him of Nintendos DS games .
New ""Zelda,"" ""Luigi"" games are coming for the console ."
"It was on a platform of the Paris Metro that Michel Desjoyeaux realized he finally had to snap out of it. He was just back from nearly 100 days sailing around the globe with no sighting of another human being, his only contact to the outside world a satellite phone. His body was, in essence, still on red alert for any obstacle in his midst. ""Waiting for the train, a guy was in the way of the doors and I just yanked him out of the way,"" recalls the 48-year-old, who just days earlier had returned to France victorious from the grueling Vendee Globe race. ""I was still in that mindset of not letting anything get in my way. It was unhealthy. It was then I said to myself, 'Michel, the race is over now.' But it's hard as solo racing just takes over your body and mind."" It is 45 years since British yachtsman Robin Knox-Johnston became the first man to perform a singlehanded, nonstop circumnavigation of the globe, achieving the feat in 312 days. He was the only person to finish of the eight-man field in the Golden Globe Race, during which one competitor Donald Crowhurst died -- having committed suicide after attempting to fake the details of his own round-the-world attempt. So what makes someone decide to take on such a daunting challenge? To spend months away from family and friends, coping on a mere four hours of sleep a night -- most of that broken -- while tackling monster waves on the world's most challenging waters? For Knox-Johnston, also the oldest person to sail around the planet solo, aged 68 back in 2007, the lure of such a perilous challenge is obvious. ""It's what I do -- I do the sea,"" he says unapologetically. ""To people it may seem dangerous, foolish even but, for me, it's not a strange environment. It's not alien to me, it's where I'm happiest. ""As for circumnavigating the globe that first time, I didn't want to get to 90 years old and think what I could have done. It was dangerous, particularly as no-one had done it before, so you couldn't read up on it, and frequently you feel in danger. Having 27 meters crashing down on your boat will make you feel that way."" See: The best sailing images of 2013 . Back in 1968, there was none of the communications enjoyed by today's sailors, requiring instinct more than anything else. So how did Knox-Johnston's voyage compare nearly four decades on? ""You realize that round-the-world sailing is a young man's game,"" he says. Desjoyeaux is one of the best modern-day exponents of solo sailing -- the only two-time winner of the prestigious Vendee Globe, in 2001 and 2009 -- and he was born into the sailing fraternity. His father, who served in the Resistance during World War Two, founded Glenans Sailing School -- which teaches 15,000 trainees each year. Nicknamed ""The Professor,"" Desjoyeaux is more than just a sailor, he is also an innovator. He writes software for the auto-pilot systems used by many sailors, and has also been integral in developing boating equipment, including the introduction of a sideways-swinging keel 11 years ago. Despite his wide-ranging proficiency, he is no stranger to adversity on the open seas. Just last month, his yacht dismasted while leading the two-handed Trans-Atlantic race from Le Havre in France to Itajai in Brazil, just 140 miles (260 kilometers) from the finishing line. Speaking by satellite phone to CNN just hours before that moment on board his vessel MACIF, he explained why he first set out on the solo voyages. ""First, your life is too short to do something you don't want to do,"" he says. ""Second, you will not be efficient because you don't want to do it, and third the most important one is if you don't want to do it then you will make mistakes and then not be efficient. ""In safety terms, that's when things go wrong. Before anything else, you have to want to do it, otherwise that's it, no point."" Desjoyeaux says the all-consuming nature of the racing (""24 hours of the day, you're just trying to optimize everything"") means it is a completely different way of life, hence his personal struggles to get back into everyday norms on land. He says the Vendee Globe, a three-month ordeal held every four years, is ""the most complete and perfect race you can imagine. ""So when I finished the first time, I was sure I'd come back - it was still something I wanted to do."" It is common to see sharks and dolphins in the water, as well as whales -- although the large mammals are to be avoided at all costs because of the damage they can do to a vessel, which is often battling treacherous seas. ""I don't think there is too much danger as safety on the boat is always No. 1,"" says Desjoyeaux. ""I don't take too many risks. If it's dangerous, I slow down and do it properly. I want to keep my life."" Traveling around the world in a vessel is not just about being a master sailor, a tactician or mentally strong. It is also about being a businessman and raising the funds required to get such an expedition off the ground. Budgets for the 2008-9 Vendee Globe were around €10 million ($13.8 million) for the very top boats, each of the leading boats costing about €3.5 million ($4.8 million). Such numbers makes British racer Steve White's achievement at that race all the more impressive. He arrived on the start line not knowing if he even had enough funds to compete. Under competition rules, all boats taking part having to be in the harbor at Les Sables-d'Olonne three weeks before the start date. Just to get to that point, he had remortgaged his and his wife's house four times in order to buy the boat on which he aimed to compete. He had two weeks in which to raise £200,000 ($328,000) to fund the trip, a big sum but small fry in global sailing terms. ""I had this green energy company all set to sponsor me to the tune of £100,000, as well as another businessman to another £100,000,"" he recalls. ""The green energy company were on board, they just needed things to be signed off in one final meeting. But then they went quiet and finally I got word that they weren't going ahead. ""So I went back to the guy (the businessman, who to this day has asked to remain nameless) and said I couldn't match his £100,000 so I didn't expect him to fulfill his side of the bargain. So I thought I'd have to face the embarrassment of sailing away before the start in front of everyone. ""He just said, 'I'll get back to you.' I carried on but felt sick and didn't hear back. I was struggling with phone reception but got a snippet about four o'clock one morning from my wife to say, 'We've got the money.' ""When I finally spoke to her, it transpired this guy had stumped up the entire money. In a flash, I'd gone from suicidal to being in tears. He'd essentially sorted me out for the rest of my life by enabling me to do this."" In the end, the trip cost £245,000, which White part-funded by being paid his €20,000 prize money for finishing eighth in advance. But it was a race against the clock just to get ready, as he and his team worked through the night to get the boat prepared. By the time he set off for his 109 days at sea, he was already shattered. Almost immediately, terrible weather hit in the Bay of Biscay, breaking up the much more expensive boats of his rivals. In all, just 11 of the 30-strong fleet finished. ""I enjoy being alone at sea, and in a weird sort of way love testing myself and seeing if I pass the test,"" White says. ""But it's an odd test. As something breaks, you're like 'good grief' and it feels like torture. But then a moment later the weather changes, as quickly as your mood, dolphins are jumping in front of the boat and there's the most amazing sun -- it's just a very serene, meditative experience."" White is not done with solo sailing. His next challenge is another solo nonstop circumnavigation, but this time the wrong way -- against the prevailing winds and currents -- before returning for another shot at the Vendee Globe in 2016. For White, the appeal of such journeys is hard to explain. ""I remember (fellow sailor) Mike Golding saying, 'You can't really understand it if you've not done it.' I didn't really get that until I did it. Unless you do, you won't either."" The record for a solo nonstop circumnavigation is a formidable 57 days, 13 hours and 34 minutes set by Francis Joyon in 2008 -- the fastest Vendee Globe completion, by comparison, was at the 2012-13 staging when Francois Gabart came home in 78 days, two hours and 16 minutes. Yet another Frenchman, Thomas Coville, is now seeking to beat Joyon's milestone -- having aborted his fourth attempt last month, he is back on the water trying again in his 31-meter maxi-trimaran. Will he break it? ""It's a phenomenal record,"" says Knox-Johnston, ""but Thomas is a very experienced sailor, and is certainly a guy capable of doing it. The target's tough right now but that's the joy of records -- they're there to be broken."" If he does so, what next for Coville and the rest of the world's solo sailors? If you have to ask, it would seem, you clearly don't understand.","Thomas Coville is the latest to attempt to break the record for solo circumnavigating the globe .

"Medical marijuana advocates are hoping state governments can succeed where their efforts have failed by asking federal authorities to reclassify pot as a drug with medical use. Shortly before Christmas, Colorado became the fourth state to ask the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to reclassify marijuana as a narcotic in the same league as heavyweight painkillers including oxycodone. The governors of Washington and Rhode Island filed a formal petition with the agency in November, and Vermont signed onto that request shortly afterward. All four are among the sixteen states and the District of Columbia that have laws on the books that allow the medical use of marijuana, even though the drug remains illegal under federal law. Meanwhile, federal authorities have asserted their power by raiding dispensaries in states including California and Washington. Supporters say the public is on their side, and the state requests show the feds are increasingly isolated on the issue. But they acknowledge it's still an uphill battle. ""I don't think that we're going to see to much change in Washington's position on this until public opinion and state-level support reaches a little bit higher a tipping point,"" said Morgan Fox, a spokesman for the D.C.-based Marijuana Policy Project. The DEA said it would ""reply accordingly,"" but noted that similar petitions had been rejected before. DEA spokeswoman Barbara Carreno told CNN that the agency gives ""great respect"" to state governments, but their requests would get ""the same attention as a petition from a medical group or anything else."" Marijuana is listed as a Schedule I drug by the DEA, meaning it's dangerous and has no medical use. Medical marijuana advocates, including the states that have petitioned the agency, say it should be listed under Schedule II, comparing it to other prescription painkillers that have a high potential for abuse. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restated its opposition to medical marijuana, saying ""no sound scientific studies"" support its use. State laws authorizing it ""are inconsistent with efforts to ensure that medications undergo the rigorous scientific scrutiny of the FDA approval process,"" it added. But in their November petition, Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire and Rhode Island's Lincoln Chafee argued that ""the vast majority of modern research"" has found marijuana useful for treating patients with glaucoma, for relieving the nausea suffered by cancer patients in chemotherapy and for relieving symptoms of degenerative nerve diseases. They cite a 2001 study by the National Academy of Sciences that recommended research into the ""potential therapeutic value"" of cannabis, though it warned that smoking pot was a ""crude"" method ""that also delivers harmful substances."" ""Since the last FDA review in 2006, the scientific process has identified and clarified even more of the therapeutic effects of cannabis through ongoing research and assessment of available data,"" wrote Gregoire, a Democrat, and Chafee, a former Republican-turned-independent. ""This petition presents this further evidence. It is now time for the DEA to reschedule the substance."" The Obama administration says it is willing to support research, but has taken a stiff position against medical marijuana. In October, in response to online petitions, White House drug czar Gil Kerlikowske said marijuana ""is not a benign drug."" Medical marijuana group sues Obama administration . ""Like many, we are interested in the potential marijuana may have in providing relief to individuals diagnosed with certain serious illnesses. That is why we ardently support ongoing research into determining what components of the marijuana plant can be used as medicine,"" Kerlikowske wrote. ""To date, however, neither the FDA nor the Institute of Medicine have found smoked marijuana to meet the modern standard for safe or effective medicine for any condition."" Carreno said petitions to reschedule a drug take years to review. The DEA does its own analysis, then refers the requests to the FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services, which review their own research. ""Then they send recommendations back to us, and based on the recommendation we get, we make a decision,"" she said. Critics call medical marijuana a ""Trojan horse"" for legalizing the drug entirely, and federal authorities mounted a string of high-profile raids in California, Washington and Montana in 2011. The Justice Department says it isn't targeting patients who are in ""clear and unambiguous compliance"" with state laws. In October's raids in California, prosecutors said they were targeting organizations that had become large-scale commercial traffickers, operating beyond the limits of state law. In their petition, Gregoire and Chafee said rescheduling was needed because states can't make rules governing medical marijuana ""without putting their employees at risk of violating federal law."" ""From a patient perspective, there's a lot of things up in the air,"" Gregoire spokesman Cory Curtis told CNN. He said the state hopes ""to give them clarity and peace of mind, both in the environment in which they get it and the prescription and dose they get."" A round of federal raids targeted dispensaries in the Seattle area in November, but agents were targeting ""folks who were distributing without a medical purpose,"" Curtis said. Washington allows patients to grow their own marijuana and keep a 60-day supply, which it defines as up to 24 ounces. Patients and designated health-care providers can keep ""collective gardens."" Rhode Island allows patients to grow up to 12 plants and possess up to 2.5 ounces of pot for their own use, as long as a doctor has certified that it may alleviate symptoms and the potential risks don't outweigh the benefits. It also allows ""compassion centers"" to cultivate and dispense marijuana, as long as it stays within those limits for each patient. In Colorado, legislation passed in 2010 allows state regulators to keep a tight rein on dispensaries and required them to request reclassification from the DEA. ""As long as there is a divergence in state and federal law, there is a lack of certainty necessary to provide safe access for patients with serious medical conditions,"" Barbara Brohl, the executive director of Colorado's Department of Revenue, wrote in a December 22 letter to DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart. Since the law went into effect, more than 700 people have applied for licenses to sell medical marijuana, said Mark Couch, a spokesman for Brohl's office. The state collected about $5 million in sales taxes in the last fiscal year, which ended in June -- a tiny fraction of the state's $8 billion general fund, he said. Fox said the state's requests to reclassify the drug ""could and certainly should"" give the states some breathing room, ""but I really don't think it will."" ""I think that it's not going to provide any real tangible benefits immediately,"" he said. But it if succeeds, ""It will definitely bring the federal government more in line with currently accepted science."" In the meantime, ""There's no reason for the federal government to be wasting resources going after medical marijuana providers,"" he said.","Four states have asked federal officials to reclassify marijuana .
Governors say they can't set rules without risking violations of U.S. law .
Advocates say there's no reason to keep busting medical pot providers .

"Today, April 20, is ""420: International Marijuana Day."" Festivals and marches are planned around the world. The number 420 reflects the date, but it also represents the term's clandestine origin in the 1970s, brought about by laws that still plague cannabis consumers today. In 1971, a group of high school friends, the ""Waldos,"" invented 420 as a code word for smoking pot. Referring to 4:20 p.m. after school, the friends from San Rafael, California, would meet to smoke marijuana in their secret spot next to a wall -- the origin of their nickname. In the 40 years since, 420 has spread to become an international symbol for using marijuana, and it's a part of the cannabis consumer's vocabulary. Threatened with jail and unemployment, people who use marijuana in most states must hide their activities. In 2011, more than 750,000 people were arrested for marijuana possession and sales in the United States. In 2010, 86% of those charged for possession in New York City were black or Latino. That, even though these groups represent about half the city's population and use marijuana less than whites. But, slowly, support for cannabis regulation is growing. A recent Pew research poll found that 52% of Americans support taxing and regulating marijuana, a historic high. It isn't that more people are using marijuana -- those rates have remained stable -- it's that more people feel they can come out of the closet about their support for marijuana policy reform. Websites like the Marijuana Majority feature statements from celebrities and politicians in favor of marijuana policy reform, across the political spectrum, from Bill Maher to Pat Robertson. No longer a part of a fringe, those who see a better way to regulate marijuana are casting aside the secret codes and openly declaring support. The marijuana flag was waving proudly on Election Day, when Colorado and Washington became the first states where voters approved taxing and regulating marijuana for adult use. Two recently introduced pieces of federal legislation would protect medical marijuana states from federal interference and end federal marijuana prohibition. As can be imagined, the April 20 celebrations across Colorado and Washington, as well as other ""marijuana friendly"" states like California and Oregon, will be joyful, well attended and burgeoning with cannabis products. It might even feel as if marijuana is already legal -- but it isn't, and, in some states, the need for secret codes is still very much alive. In Oklahoma, manufacturing hash carries a mandatory two-year prison term but can also mean life in prison. Under Louisiana law, a second pot possession conviction is classified as a felony offense, punishable by up to five years in prison. Three-time offenders face up to 20 years in prison. And in Florida, possession of more than 20 grams of marijuana, as well as the cultivation of even a single plant, is a felony offense and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. What this means, despite Colorado and Washington, is that April 20 brings a chance to stop and reflect on the draconian marijuana laws still threatening so many Americans. In addition to the lives harmed by arrests and incarceration, the economic costs of prohibition are enormous. The war on drugs has cost at least $1 trillion since it was announced in 1971 by President Nixon. The term 420 began as a secret code. But 40 years later, in some states the need for a code has given way to ""cannabis pride"" and open celebration. In other places, people will smoke or otherwise consume pot in private parties. And for those in prison and jails and for their loved ones, it will be just another sad day. Make this April 20, as the numbers of pro-legalization supporters swell, the day to join the Drug Policy Alliance in promoting the legalization of marijuana for all adults and an end to the war on drugs.","This Saturday, April 20, is ""420: International Marijuana Day,"" with festivals worldwide .

"Before we jump into a debate about the environmental costs of eating meat, here are three things you should know: . 1. I've experimented with vegetarianism twice, but it's never really stuck. Round one ended when I had a dream about a spicy chicken sandwich from Wendy's, and then woke up to march zombie-style to that fast-food restaurant to order it. Round two may or may not have ended with the brunch I had Sunday, I'm still not sure. 2. I ate chicken chilaquiles for brunch on Sunday. It was delicious. Therefore, 3. This is not an anti-meat polemic. But I have been thinking in recent weeks about our relationships with animals and what our diets mean for the health of the environment. It started while I was doing research for a story on illegal animal trafficking, and I was reading books, including Dana Goodyear's ""Anything that Moves"" -- about how the American foodie scene is trending toward the bizarre and endangered (witness the 2010 bust of a California restaurant serving whale) -- and Jonathan Safran Foer's ""Eating Animals,"" which argues, in part, that one cannot eat meat and also earnestly claim to be an environmentalist. ""(S)omeone who regularly eats factory-farmed animal products cannot call himself an environmentalist without divorcing that word from its meaning,"" he wrote in that book. Since it's Earth Day, I thought that last point might merit some dissection. Is it possible to eat meat in modern-day America, consider yourself an environmentalist and sleep soundly without being a hypocrite? Or, as Foer argues, are those terms increasingly incongruous? Eatocracy: Tips for eating green on Earth Day . I called up a few experts and asked your advice on this topic. As one of my Facebook friends was smart to point out, it's probably not a good idea to be in the business of telling people ""what they are or are not."" Environmentalism takes many forms and encompasses a range of issues. I'm not willing to say a person cannot be an environmentalist and also an omnivore. (If you ride a bike and eat steak, is that better or worse than being a vegetarian who drives a Hummer?) But I would hope that person has thought through the very real environmental consequences of meat consumption. Animal rights aside, there are plenty to consider. Here are a few: . 1. Raising animals for meat is much less efficient than growing vegetables: Think back to those food chain diagrams from elementary school. Animals are higher on the food chain than plants, and therefore they take more land, food and water to grow for our consumption. The difference in efficiency isn't negligible: Raising a kilogram of beef requires 15,500 liters of water, according to waterfootprint.org. An equivalent amount of bread requires only 1,300 liters of water; bananas use 860; and tomatoes consume just 180 liters, or about 1% of the water required for beef. (Chocolate, by the way, is actually worse than all of these, requiring 24,000 liters; but it's clear that a vegetarian diet is far more water- and energy-efficient than one that includes meat.) At a time when rivers in the American Southwest are running dry because of drought and climate change, it's worth considering the impact our eating habits have on water use. The same is true for land. Because growing vegetables is more land-efficient than growing meat, we would need to eat far less meat in order to avoid taking over more forests for farms, said Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University. To be sustainable, America needs to eat about half the meat it does today, he said. That would return us to about 1940s consumption levels. Per capita meat consumption in the United States appears to have peaked around the year 2000 at more than 180 pounds of meat per person per year, or about half a pound each day, according to the Earth Policy Institute. It's fallen slightly since then, which is good news. 2. Animal agriculture pollutes the water: Last summer, like pretty much every summer, there was a ""dead zone"" in the Gulf of Mexico the size of Connecticut. Blame agriculture, including animal agriculture, for that disturbing phenomenon, which is caused when phosphorus and nitrogen from chemical fertilizer and manure run down the Mississippi River and into the gulf. Much of the fertilizer that ends up in that watershed is used to grow corn, 80% of which is being produced to feed livestock and fish, according to National Corn Growers Association figures cited by EPA. The amount of manure that animal farms create is also staggering -- U.S. federal agencies estimate livestock and poultry ""generate"" about 500 million tons of manure per year -- and has serious consequences for the health of rivers and groundwater. 3. Eating meat adds to your greenhouse gas footprint: Finally, eating animals, like doing almost anything, contributes to a person's greenhouse gas footprint. The United Nations estimates animal agriculture accounts for 14.5% of human greenhouse gas emissions, with the main source of those emissions -- 45% of the total -- being the fossil fuels used while growing and fertilizing crops to feed the animals. There's some debate about how much animal agriculture contributes to climate change overall. But there's no doubt it has a sizable impact, and more so than plant agriculture. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, eating a half-pound of beef creates more than 7 pounds of carbon-dioxide-equivalent gases. Pork and chicken are better, creating about 2 pounds and half a  pound, respectively. Potatoes, apples and asparagus are better still, creating a tiny fraction of a pound of greenhouse gases. So: Knowing all that, I would encourage you to consider giving up meat -- or even just one of the most resource-intensive meats, like beef -- for Earth Day. See how it goes, and maybe you can make it a habit. There are many other worthy efforts you could make to protect the environment, of course. You could ride a bike, take a train, turn off the heat or AC. But giving up meat for a day is an easy and meaningful one. ""If all Americans eliminated just one quarter-pound serving of beef per week, the reduction in global warming pollution would be equal to taking 4 to 6 million cars off the road,"" according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. You might find it's awful and decide to focus your future efforts elsewhere. Or, like me, you might find it's not so bad. I'm not going to make any bold pronouncements about my eating habits besides the fact that I'm going to try to eat less meat. (I like TreeHugger founder Graham Hill's idea of eating meat only on the weekends; and singer Paul McCartney's idea of Meat Free Mondays.) I travel frequently, and value flexibility, so I've never really wanted to be too strict about my diet in the long term. But one day? One week? One month? It's not that hard. To the minority of vegans and vegetarians who like to proselytize about their eating habits, I'm sure that seems like an annoying cop-out. But there are plenty of environmentalists who advocate a middle-road approach to meat consumption. ""Certainly there are modest steps we can all take that can really have a significant benefit if a lot of people did them,"" said Erik Olson, a health and food expert at NRDC, the environmental group. ""We often fall into this mistaken all-or-nothing mentality."" I like that approach. It's one more people are likely to stomach. And it's one that -- even for a day -- can have real impact.","A growing body of evidence shows eating meat has environmental consequences .

"MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN)  -- A three-judge panel will begin hearing testimony Monday in Republican Norm Coleman's post-election legal challenge for the U.S. Senate seat. Norm Coleman will argue many votes were not recounted properly in his bid for re-election to the U.S. Senate. An election-night count showed Coleman, who was the incumbent senator from Minnesota, ahead by a few hundred votes. A recount handed victory to his opponent, Democrat Al Franken, by 225 votes. About 3 million ballots were cast in the race. ""We have a good shot at this, and so I proceed with that in mind,"" Coleman said last week, calling Franken's lead ""artificial."" To aid in his battle, Coleman has retained Ben Ginsberg, the lawyer who led the Florida recount efforts for the Republican side during the disputed presidential election in 2000. Coleman's attorneys plan to argue three points: . • That nearly 12,000 absentee ballots rejected on Election Day should be recounted because at least 4,500 of them were discarded in error. If those ballots are allowed, they could flip the race back in Coleman's favor. • That the canvassing board did not use a uniform standard when it counted 933 ballots from the discarded pile of absentee ballots. Those 933 gave Franken the edge. • That some votes were counted twice, which also worked in Franken's favor. The burden to prove the ballot discrepancies falls on the Coleman team, Ginsberg said. ""We are, after all, the contestant,"" he said. ""But I have to say that we feel little weight on our shoulders as we go forward."" The Coleman team has said it will also file a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the absentee voters whose ballots were rejected. The lawyers dismissed assertions by the Franken side that Minnesota is in a ""constitutional crisis"" because it has only one senator in Washington. Ginsberg pointed out that Illinois and New York had one senator attending sessions when then-Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were campaigning during the presidential race. Ginsberg said ""the Franken campaign are not nearly so concerned about"" those vacancies. Marc Elias, the lead attorney for the Franken recount team, laughed at the comparison and said Ginsberg was ""thankfully"" not serving in the U.S. Senate. ""The fact is that the Constitution of the United States provides for two senators from every state,"" he said. The Franken side will ask the Minnesota Supreme Court on February 5 to order Gov. Tim Pawlenty and Secretary of State Mark Ritchie to issue a temporary election certificate so Franken can be seated in the Senate. Both men have refused, saying they will wait until the matter is resolved. It is uncertain how long the case will take to wind its way through the legal channels. Even if the trial ends quickly, either side could file additional appeals to the state Supreme Court or the federal courts. The Minnesota seat is the only vacancy in the Senate, which Democrats control by a 58 to 41 margin. Should Franken prevail, Democrats would be one vote shy of 60, which would give them the power to muscle through major legislative initiatives over Republican objections. Coleman was first elected to the Senate in 2002 and has served one term. Franken is a comedian and liberal talk show host. CNN's Chris Welch contributed to this report.","About 3 million ballots cast in race; Al Franken won recount by 255 votes .

"(CNN) -- The entire eastern coast of the United States should prepare for Irene, a large and dangerous hurricane churning northwestward over the tropical waters of the Caribbean, the nation's emergency chief warned Tuesday. At 8 p.m. ET, the National Hurricane Center said the winds in Irene remained unchanged from its previous update, at 90 mph, making the storm a Category 1 hurricane. However, the reduction is expected to be only temporary, and Irene is still forecast to become a Category 3 event, a major hurricane, by Wednesday night or Thursday, the center said. Irene was moving through the southern Bahamas and will pass very near or over the Turks and Caicos islands later Tuesday night, CNN Senior Meteorologist Dave Hennen said early Tuesday evening. The storm could threaten the North Carolina coast on Saturday and is likely to continue to be a hurricane all the way into New England as it moves along or over the northeast coast, Hennen said. Widespread damage is possible from coastal Carolina all the way up to the Canadian Maritimes, including the major cities of the Northeast, Hennen said. Conditions continue to be favorable for Irene to intensify to a major hurricane, a Category 3 or higher, with 110 mph winds or stronger, as it moves through the Bahamas on Thursday and passes just east of Nassau and Freeport, Hennen said. But Craig Fugate, the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator, noted that Irene's exact path cannot be predicted this far out. The storm, he said, will affect a large area. ""People think hurricanes are a Southern thing but people in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast need to take Irene seriously,"" Fugate said. ""We have a lot of time for people to get ready but we don't have forever."" Hennen said Irene is expected to pass well east of Florida so only minimal effects are expected Thursday and Friday as the storm moves northward toward the Carolinas. A landfall is possible on Saturday as the storm approaches North Carolina. As of Tuesday, the most likely place for landfall appears to be on the Outer Banks of North Carolina as the computer models have continued to shift the track of the storm eastward, Hennen said. He added it's possible, if this trend continues, that the dangerous core of Irene may miss North Carolina altogether and stay just offshore. Beyond Saturday, most of the computer models continue to show the storm very close or over coastal sections of the Northeast, Hennen said. Many models and the official forecast show a hurricane landfall in the Northeast anywhere from Delaware to New Jersey, Long Island, into Cape Cod and the islands.  Widespread damage from wind, rain, and heavy surf appears likely as the storm moves through, he said. Even if the storm does not make a direct hit on the Northeast, the impact could be the same as a very intense winter nor'easter, Hennen said.  Hurricane-force winds may occur in major cities like Philadelphia, New York and Boston along with widespread power outages and severe flooding affecting possibly millions of people, Hennen said. While the effects of a Category 3 or higher hurricane hitting the Outer Banks is potentially devastating, the bigger impact with Irene may be on the Northeast, which could take a direct hit from a hurricane for the first time in decades or experience a very intense storm that stays just off the coast, Hennen said. Emergency officials in southeastern states have already stepped up operations in preparation for the first significant storm to threaten the United States in three years. North Carolina's coastal Ocracoke Island on the Outer Banks and surrounding Hyde County have declared a state of emergency starting at 5 a.m. Wednesday. Officials declared a mandatory evacuation for all visitors and residents starting at 5 a.m. Thursday. ""We will be ready if Hurricane Irene reaches North Carolina,"" Gov. Beverly Perdue said. ""Our teams are already lining up supplies, trucks and resources to reach anywhere the storm might touch."" Perdue said at a news conference Tuesday that ""in North Carolina, we're prepared."" ""Quite frankly (the state's) emergency center has done this over and over and over, and we have the best system in America, we know that ... and that system is very, very robust and strong."" But she advised coastal residents especially to make plans and to prepare hurricane evacuation kits: ""food supplies, medicine, water -- begin to think about your pets, begin to think about those things all around your home or business that can cause damage if there are high winds."" In South Carolina, emergency officials in Beaufort County, which includes Hilton Head Island, worked to make certain that construction sites on major highways could be cleared quickly in case evacuations of coastal areas became necessary. ""We're contacting (construction crews) every day now to make sure if we should have to do something, that they could remove their barrels and construction equipment, etc. to clear the road so we don't have impediment in the roadways,"" county Emergency Management Director Todd Ferguson said Tuesday evening. ""We ... will continue to do that until this threat is passed."" Irene became a Category 2 hurricane Monday evening, with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph. The storm, moving at 10 miles per hour, is expected to strengthen to a Category 3 by Wednesday, which would make it a major hurricane, forecasters said, and then approach Category 4 status as it gathers steam and organizes over the warm ocean. ""We see no reason for it not to be a major hurricane,"" said Bill Read, director of the Miami-based National Hurricane Center. Read said Irene could potentially affect the unveiling of the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial in Washington and cause problems with flooding in northeastern states that have already experienced high levels of rainfall this summer. He said the Atlantic up to Cape Hatteras in North Carolina is warm enough to sustain a major hurricane. Tuesday, Irene took aim at the Turks and Caicos islands after lashing the Dominican Republic with 100 mph winds and heavy rain. It is expected to reach the southeastern and central Bahamas by early Wednesday. Forecasters said Irene could bring another 4 to 8 inches of rain to the Dominican Republic and Haiti, with as much as 15 inches in higher elevations. Potentially dangerous flooding and mudslides were a threat, the center said. Rainfall accumulations of 5 to 10 inches are expected in the southeastern and central Bahamas and in the Turks and Caicos islands, it said. On Grand Turk Island, the skies grew dark Tuesday morning. Janet Williams, the office manager at the Osprey Beach Hotel, said many guests had evacuated but 11 remained and were planning to ride out the storm in the hotel. With memories still fresh of Ike, a monster 2008 hurricane, residents were taking no chances, Williams said. The streets were empty and windows boarded up. In Puerto Rico, the storm left widespread damage and about 600,000 of the island's 1 million electricity customers were without power, Gov. Luis Fortuno said Monday. Nearly 800 people were in shelters, but no injuries had been reported. President Barack Obama signed an emergency declaration for Puerto Rico, which will allow for federal disaster assistance to the U.S. commonwealth. CNN iReporter John Hall captured images of dark clouds in San Juan as strong winds whipped against his microphone. ""I have been prepared since the start of the hurricane season with plenty of water, food, flashlights, candles and of course all my camera and video equipment,"" he wrote to CNN. CNN's Moni Basu, Ed Payne, Joe Sutton, Thomas Andres and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","North Carolina governor: ""We're prepared""

"We don't yet know how or why the Tsarnaev brothers, the alleged Boston Marathon bombers, decided to carry out their attacks, but a look at how their stories correlate with those of some other terrorists living in the West could provide some answers to the questions that many are now asking about them. 1. How could someone who grew up in the United States, as the younger brother did, become a terrorist? Major Nidal Malik Hasan, who killed 13 people at Fort Hood Army Base in Texas in 2009, was born and raised in Virginia. He self-radicalized, in part, over the Internet, which he used to reach out to the Yemen-based preacher Anwar al-Awlaki for advice about whether it is permissible for Muslim soldiers in the U.S. military to kill their comrades in the name of jihad. Awlaki, a leader of al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, was somewhat noncommittal in his responses but did not discourage the act. Investigators will surely be combing through the e-mail traffic of the Tsarnaev brothers to see if they either reached out to militant Islamist clerics or downloaded lectures by such clerics. They will also examine the brothers' Internet usage to see if they visited jihadist forums or downloaded propaganda from al Qaeda or other allied groups. And of course, it's possible their decision to carry out the attacks was reached without any outside influence. Boston suspects: Immigrant dream to American nightmare . 2. How do you square the multiple descriptions of the brothers as ""good guys"" with the fact that they plotted mass murder? It's worth recalling that Mohammed Sidique Khan, the leader of the suicide attackers who bombed the London transit system in 2005 killing 52 commuters, was a beloved teacher at a primary school in the northern city of Leeds who taught children with developmental problems, and the happily married 30-year-old father of a baby daughter. Colleagues and acquaintances described Khan as a gentle, kind man. No surprise then that we are hearing some similar positive characterizations of the brothers Tsarnaev. 3. Did the brothers have any training or practice on explosives? It seems quite unlikely that the perpetrators would have been able to successfully set off two deadly bombs within seconds of each other without some sort of training or practice. Bomb-making recipes certainly exist on the Internet, but actually building effective bombs is generally a skill that requires some training or practice, and even then a successful detonation is not guaranteed. Faizal Shahzad, for instance, received bomb-making training from the Pakistani Taliban before he constructed a bomb in an SUV that fizzled out rather than blowing up as he intended in Times Square on May 1, 2010. The older Tsarnaev brother, Tamerlan, spent six months in Russia last year. What precisely he did there will surely be of intense interest to investigators. Could he have received some kind of bomb-training from Chechen militants who are experienced in making explosives? Najibullah Zazi, a Pakistani-American who had also lived for many years in the United States, plotted to blow up bombs on the Manhattan subway around the eighth anniversary of 9/11. Zazi travelled to Pakistan a year before his planned attacks to learn bomb-making techniques from al Qaeda militants. Was this the kind of model that Tamerlan Tsarnaev followed? Also, might the Tsarnaev brothers have done some kind of test runs of their explosive devices in the United States? Opinion: Suspects' culture of migration and machismo . 4. If the brothers' motivation had something to do with their Chechen heritage, how might that have played out in this case? In the years after 9/11, dozens of young Somali-American men traveled to fight in the civil war in Somalia. Just as the Tsarnaev brothers, these Somali-Americans were first-generation Americans. For these new Americans, the politics of their homeland can sometimes become more meaningful and important than it was for their parents who fled the chaos of their native countries for the safety of the United States, and who now want to put those conflicts behind them. What exactly prompted the FBI to interview Tamerlan Tsarnaev in 2011, following a tip from Russia that he was ""a follower of radical Islam"" and was contemplating leaving the United States to join a clandestine organization? 5. Did FBI officials make a mistake when they questioned Tamerlan, but didn't seem to further monitor him? Maybe.  This is reminiscent of the case of Major Hasan whose emails to fellow militants came to the attention of the feds before he killed his fellow soldiers at Ft. Hood, but were not followed up on. Carlos Bledsoe, a convert to Islam, shot up a military recruiting office Little Rock, Arkansas, killing a soldier in 2009. Bledsoe was also on the radar of the feds before he travelled to Yemen. It was only after this trip to Yemen, where he linked up with an al Qaeda affiliate, that Bledsoe carried out the shooting at the recruiting office. 6. Did the brothers intend to die during the attacks or their aftermath? It seems shocking to many that the Tsarnaev brothers might have been wearing suicide vests during their gun battle with police on Thursday night, but in reality several U.S. citizens and residents have intended to die in terrorist attacks. Three of the young Somali-American men who traveled from Minnesota to fight in civil war in Somalia later carried out suicide attacks there. Major Hasan undoubtedly went into his attack on a military base full of armed U.S. soldiers believing that it would be the last thing he did before he died. (That prediction did not come true. He was wounded in the attack but not killed). The Al Qaeda recruit Zazi, who plotted to bomb the Manhattan subway in the summer of 2009, planned to die in this attack but was arrested before he could pull it off. Analysis: Older suspect grew increasingly religious . 7. Were the brothers really ""lone wolves""? Given all the mayhem the two brothers are allegedly responsible for -- two bombings that caused three deaths and some two hundred injuries at the Boston Marathon as well as the subsequent murder of a policeman at MIT -- did they have some kind of additional help? According to Boston law enforcement officials, there is no evidence of such help and it's worth recalling that Hasan was entirely a lone wolf who nonetheless managed to kill 13 on a U.S. military base with heavy security. 8. Did the older Tsarnaev radicalize his younger brother? Perhaps. Where there is some kind of terrorist cell there is sometimes a leader who instigates action. We saw this in the case in Lackawanna, New York where a group of Yemeni-American men who trained with al Qaeda in Afghanistan before 9/11 were radicalized by Kamal Derwish, a Yemeni American who had spent many years living in Saudi Arabia. Derwish encouraged his fellow Yemeni-Americans to travel to Afghanistan for military training. 9.  How unusual is it for brothers to carry out terrorist attacks together? More frequent than you might think. The deadliest terrorist attack in U.S. history on 9/11 involved three pairs of brothers among the 19 hijackers: brothers Waleed and Wail al-Sheri, Hamza and Ahmed al-Ghamdi and Nawaf and Salem al-Hazmi.","Peter Bergen: Many unresolved questions about how or why brothers carried out bombing .

"An ISIS attack against the West is a question of timing -- ""not of inevitably, not of intent,"" according to the former head of the CIA, retired Gen. Michael Hayden . Speaking to CNN's Jim Sciutto on ""Fareed Zakaria GPS,"" Hayden said he expects ISIS to attempt an attack on targets in the United States or Europe. ""ISIS is a very powerful local organization, and probably a reasonably powerful regional terrorist organization,"" Hayden said. ""But it's one that has global ambitions -- and it has the tools."" There's no clear consensus inside the intelligence community as to whether ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, is currently capable of striking the West. That debate came to the forefront last week after the Sunni militant group beheaded American journalist James Foley in retaliation for the airstrikes -- an act that Michael Morell, the former deputy director of the CIA, called the group's ""first terrorist attack against the United States,"" in an interview with CBS. ""It's expressed the intent,"" Hayden said. ""There's no way more powerful way to express their street credentials among the jihadist community than a successful attack against the West."" The U.S. military has conducted targeted airstrikes in order to stop ISIS's progress in the region. The Obama administration initially said the strikes were carried out in order to protect U.S. personnel at the consulate in Irbil, Iraq, and prevent the genocide of the Yazidi people, a religious minority in the country. That mission has appeared to have been broadened -- strikes continued to hit ISIS targets near Irbil and the Mosul Dam on Sunday, U.S. Central Command said in a news release. The majority of the strikes have been in support of Iraqi forces near the dam, which briefly fell under ISIS control. Hayden said that American airstrikes inside Syria, in addition to those being conducted in Iraq, would make a difference in the fight against ISIS. Airstrikes in Iraq come at the request of that government; Syria, however, is in the midst of a civil war in which almost 200,000 people have been killed. The United States has called for its President, Bashar al-Assad, to step down. ""It's not just about defense; it's not just about keeping the right people off of aircraft,"" Hayden said. ""It's about offense. It's about disabling ISIS. It's about making them more worried, more consumed with protecting their own survivability rather than yours or mine.""","Former CIA chief Michael Hayden says ISIS will attempt to attack targets in Europe, U.S.

But I'll need your help to make it work. Here's what you can do: In the gallery at the top of this story you'll find information about six nonvoters in Hawaii. They have some interesting reasons for not voting. One is a high school student who has specific political interests but says he feels too young and uninformed to participate in something as serious as voting. Hawaii: The state that doesn't vote . Another doesn't want Hawaii to be part of the United States, so she doesn't participate on principle, even though she could try to vote in leaders that would push against statehood. Another was driving to the polls during a recent election and turned back because she heard the winner of the presidential race announced on her car radio. Hawaii is six hours behind Eastern Time.

"(CNN) -- The social networking site Facebook on Monday pulled a third-party application that allows users to create polls after a site member built a poll asking if President Obama should be killed. There are more than 350,000 applications on Facebook. The company says it disables any that violate its terms. The U.S. Secret Service, the agency assigned to protect the president, has launched an investigation, agency spokesman James Mackin said. ""As is usually the case, our vigilant users reported it to us first,"" Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told CNN. ""The USSS [Secret Service] sent us an e-mail late this morning PDT asking us to take it down. At that point, it had already been removed, and we let them know."" Schnitt said the application ""was immediately suspended while the inappropriate content could be removed by the developer and until such time as the developer institutes better procedures to monitor their user-generated content.""

"It's been eight years since a black exotic dancer in Durham, North Carolina, accused three white Duke University lacrosse players of rape, sexual assault and kidnapping at a party. Whether you believe justice was adequately served --  without a trial, the North Carolina attorney general unilaterally declared the indicted players innocent -- one fact remains indisputable: A whole lot of underage drinking of beer and Jack Daniels was going on throughout much of that March day, badly impairing the judgment of the more than 40 man-boys in attendance. According to a June 2006 study by Aaron White, then an assistant professor at the Duke University Medical Center, about 40% of college freshmen admitted they engaged in binge drinking: five or more drinks on one occasion. Some 20% of college freshmen admitted they drank even more: between 10 and 15 drinks per drinking session. ""College students drink at levels far higher than we expected,"" White wrote in the report. ""We found that roughly 20% of all freshmen males had 10 or more drinks at least once during the two-week period (of the study.) This is twice the binge threshold."" He found that ""highly excessive drinking"" is more common on American college campuses than in other countries, although in Denmark, Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Russia there are also high rates of drinking on college campuses. College and university presidents generally agree that binge and underage drinking are the single greatest problems facing their schools, in large part because of all the bad behavior -- including rape -- that results from excessive and acute drinking on campus. Not surprisingly, Duke students are hardly immune to the epidemic of excessive drinking. In its own 2000 study about alcohol abuse among its students, Duke found that 41% said they engaged in binge drinking. In the first two months of the 2000 school year -- Duke's 75th anniversary -- 18 students were admitted to the emergency room with alcohol-related problems, 13 of whom were freshmen. Despite the drinking age of 21, about 74% of drinking violations at Duke in 1999 were committed by freshmen. James Clack, a student affairs administrator, wrote a message to incoming freshmen in August 2000 telling them not to be pressured ""to become a dangerous drinker. ... If you want to major in alcohol, please go elsewhere."" Clack's admonition fell, and continues to fall, on deaf ears. Not only did excessive drinking lead to the lacrosse players' decision to hire, at a cost of $400 each, the two strippers in the first place -- apparently not uncommon at Duke fraternity and sorority parties -- but it also led to the boys' taunting of the women with a broomstick, to their unsavory public humiliation of the two dancers as the sexual fervor in the living room ratcheted up and to their hurling of ugly racial epithets at them after they abruptly left the off-campus house. Whether it also led the three indicted players to rape Crystal Mangum, as she said happened in one of the bathrooms, will never be known. But while the debate about that continues, the open question remains of how much longer we as a nation are going to continue to tolerate underage drinking on college campuses. The drinking age of 21 is a national joke. Every college campus in the country is filled with students who violate the drinking law every week, if not every day, while university administrators turn a mostly blind eye. Some matriculating freshmen know intuitively that soon after the acceptance letter arrives, the next task is to obtain -- usually for around $100 or so -- a spiffy fake identification card that will convince inquiring minds that its holder can drink legally. And the IDs are pretty darn convincing. But it's all a farce, and does nobody any favors. For any semblance of hope that binge drinking, and its attendant bad behavior, can be curtailed on college campuses, Congress must act sooner rather than later to lower the drinking age to 19 years old. That seems to me, as the father of two underage college students, the right age for drinking to be legal. By then, when most students are sophomores, one year of college will be in the bag, with the awkward but necessary social adjustments mostly accomplished. Instead of students continuously lusting after the forbidden fruit of alcohol and sneaking around furtively with bottles of vodka and rum and then quickly guzzling them in an effort to get limbered up to be able to ""hook up"" with one's peers, perhaps a more, shall we say, refined and responsible approach to alcohol can prevail on campus. A drinking age of 19 would also mean that easily three-quarters of the students on a college campus would no longer be violating the law by either drinking on campus or in unsupervised homes off-campus. The crimes allegedly committed by the three Duke lacrosse players happened in a house off Duke's East Campus. Needless to say, these off-campus binge parlors are not popular in the neighborhood. Of course, along with a lowering of the drinking age to 19, a zero tolerance policy must be put in place for anything approaching driving while intoxicated. In Brazil, for instance, it is illegal to drive with even a trace amount of alcohol in the bloodstream; in the United States, the 0.08% threshold should be abandoned in favor of zero tolerance. Anyone caught driving with any amount of alcohol in their bloodstream should have his or her driving privileges suspended for at least three years. In October 2005, Duke President Richard Brodhead gave an interview to the National Public Radio station in Chapel Hill. The night of the March 13, 2006, party was still six months in the future. But the residents of the Durham neighborhood where student partying had ratcheted up exponentially over the previous years were already in open revolt. They were sick of underage drinking, the late-night noise, the public urination and the intimidating presence in their midst of large groups of thoroughly inebriated college students. They had asked the Duke administration and the Durham police to begin cracking down on the drunken and lewd behavior. This came up during Brodhead's interview. One of the original signatories of the Amethyst Initiative -- a group that advocates lowering the drinking age to 18 and encouraging a debate among students, faculty and administrators about the responsible role of alcohol on campus -- Brodhead has long been working to confront head-on the drinking problem on campuses. From his answers on public radio, it was obvious Brodhead knew he was sitting on a powder keg. ""The problem of drinking in college, the problem of rowdiness in college—this is by no means a Duke problem,"" he said. ""It's a problem that all of us face."" One caller to the show — Betty, a resident of the Durham neighborhood where the lacrosse team would soon have its fateful party — asked Brodhead to comment on her perception that the students seemed to be regularly drinking to excess and then causing trouble. Brodhead said ""It's a challenge for everybody, and we can't make the problem go away by wishing it didn't exist."" Continuing to pretend that underage binge drinking on college campuses and the horrific behavior that derives from it doesn't exist is not a responsible and mature response to an obvious systemic problem. We can't continue to anesthetize ourselves. One possible solution is to lower the drinking age to 19 and to enact a zero tolerance policy for drinking and driving. There are undoubtedly others. Let's solve this.","William Cohan: Duke lacrosse players were drinking a lot when allegations of rape came up .

"Twenty years ago, April 5, 1992, Suada Dilberovic and Olga Sucic were shot and killed in Sarajevo. They were the shots heard around the world and they started the Bosnian War. I covered that war, and many colleagues are gathering in Sarajevo now to commemorate what took hundreds of thousands of lives, left so many more wounded, and created millions of refugees. This was the war that introduced us to the term ""ethnic cleansing."" The dominant Balkan power at the time, Serbia wanted to keep Yugoslavia together, and failing that, to carve out ethnically pure areas in the breakaway states to create a Greater Serbia. It was a horrible fantasy that sought to destroy an ethnically mixed, intermarried community that had lived peacefully and progressively together in Bosnia. This war was defining for the region, for the world and for those of us who covered it. See some amazing photos from the war . We witnessed the heroic resistance of a population under siege and shelling and sniping for nearly four years. We learned the pain of watching men, women and children brutally slaughtered. These were the non-combatants, casually targeted in the crosshairs of the sniper's rifle, blown apart by mortar shells when they went to collect water, bread, fuel or even heading to school. We learned the bitter cynicism of the international community that refused for some time to intervene, the United States and its allies finding every which way, and every tortured rhetorical device -- including refusing to use the word genocide -- to avoid getting off the sidelines. I will never forget going to the funerals, one for a little girl called Almedina. Sarajevo had run short of everything even the letter ""A"" so Almedina's grave marker could not be spelled correctly. I will never forget the mothers and fathers who would try to brave the siege around Sarajevo airport, then try to make a dash to the other side where in one village they could buy or scrounge some fresh fruit or vegetables, anything to complement the meager rations and dried food the humanitarian airlift would bring. The night I was out there, a father managed to find a single apple for his child. For that he had risked his life. On Friday more than 11,000 empty chairs will be arranged in silent poignant and powerful memory of Sarajevo's war dead. Along with the citizens of Sarajevo and other besieged Bosnian towns and villages, many of our colleagues were killed and wounded. And who will ever forget the death camps, the skeletal prisoners who evoked the terrible crimes of World War II? But this was at the end of the 20th century. This was the satellite age. We were there and we reported the story day in and day out, week after week, month...year after year. This was the era of ""never again"" and it was happening again -- ethnic cleansing and genocide here in our own backyard, and on our watch. We fought back with all the power of our media. For me, Bosnia was where I learned about the truth. Horrified when the do-nothing crowd suggested I was taking sides, or losing my objectivity, I was forced to confront this charge, and examine our Golden Rule. Here in Bosnia I determined that in the face of unspeakable crimes and the most serious violations of international humanitarian order, there is no moral equivalence, no blurring the line between victim and aggressor. Objectivity means giving all sides a fair hearing. It does not mean drawing a false moral equivalence. In this case there is no one-hand-or-the other.  And anyone who seeks to hide under that calumny is not just a liar, but an accessory, in this case to genocide. I refused. It is the lesson of my lifetime. As we all know, tens of thousands of deaths later including at Srebrenica in the summer of 1995, the worst massacre in Europe since World War Two, the U.S. finally intervened with NATO allies, ended the war and launched the peace that holds to this day. No country, no crisis, is the same. Of course Syria is not Bosnia, nor is it Libya, but in Syria today a heavily armed military is besieging and slaughtering ordinary civilians and outgunned rebels too as the state tries to crush an uprising. Just like in Bosnia, the Syrian rebels/opposition have been denied the right to self defense, for fear of ""accelerating the conflict on the ground and making it worse."" Just like in Bosnia when the U.S. and its allies said they could not intervene ""because it's a civil war and all sides are equally guilty,"" (although that was not the case as there was a clear aggressor) in Syria today they say they ""don't know who to help, who to arm, the opposition is fragmented."" The lesson of Bosnia is that our democratic and free world which seeks to uphold the highest values bestowed on humankind, could no longer watch as ordinary civilians were butchered. It's a lesson that took too long to implement, and the peace is not perfect, but at least the killing stopped.","Amanpour: Bosnia was where I learned objectivity does not mean drawing a false moral equivalence .
Amanpour: No crisis is the same but in Syria the military is fighting a heavily outgunned opposition .

"Lilongwe, Malawi (CNN) -- Malawi is in the midst of a population explosion. In 1966, the country boasted a meager four million citizens. Today, that number hovers around the 15 million mark and could reach 37 million by 2050. That's a big number for a country half the size of the United Kingdom, and could spell trouble for indigenous wildlife. ""Animals know their range. They're used to feeding and drinking (in certain areas), and those features are still there in the mind of an elephant,"" explains Alex Chunga, a manager at Kusungu National Park. ""When an animal goes back to where it used to go, and suddenly there are people, those people feel the animal is doing something wrong, but in essence, it used to be their home."" Each year, thousands of wild animals fall victim to human encroachment, poaching and the illegal pet trade. The Lilongwe Wildlife Center -- the country's only accredited wildlife sanctuary -- is hoping to change that. They house over 200 animals and host educational tours for school children to get them into conservation early. Cast of characters . Every animal as the Lilongwe Wildlife Center has a story, and often, not a happy one. Take for instance Stumpy, a one-armed baboon who was found tied to a tree outside a butcher shop. Because he likely wouldn't survive back in the wild, the Center will be his home for the remainder of his life. Then there are the seven owls (each since named after one of Snow White's dwarfs) who a local found on his roof and, fearing they were bad luck, almost killed them before someone convinced him to call them in instead. There's also Xena, a vervet monkey who was kept as a pet and tied to a rope on the roof of a barn. As a result, she's never interacted with other monkeys, and has to be trained to coexist with her own kind. ""This is a good site for animals who are not getting the proper welfare,"" says Yessiah Symon, Lilongwe's head of animal care. Do they stay or do they go? Lilongwe is partnered with Kasungu National Park, 111 miles outside of the reserve, to release some animals back into the wild. To qualify for release, an animal needs to have spent part of its life in the wild, or be young enough to adapt. It also has to be in good health. A lot goes into training animals to reintegrate into the world at large. For starters, there is a strict no-human contact policy. The subjects are also given predator awareness training. Once reintroduced into the park, some animals are then monitored by release managers to make sure they're integrating properly. Conservation for the future . To further the cause, Lilongwe hosts thousands of school children each year. Last year alone, they received over 30,000 school groups. They teach the children respect for wildlife, and try and drive home the point that some animals -- like primates -- aren't meant to be pets. ""We've managed to come up with various modules, from targeting biodiversity, soil management, climate change, and wildlife welfare,"" explains Clement Manjaalera, Lilongwe's education manager. ""Inspiring youth to conserve nature, to look after animals and have respect towards these animals and also to take a leading role in these projects is important. It can be useful in helping them to have a sustainable livelihood.""","Each year, thousands of wild animals fall victim to poaching .

"We arrive in the morning at the Animal Quarantine Center in Nakhon Phanom, north-east Thailand, just a few kilometers away from mountains which outline the border with Laos. The summer heat is already beating down hard and it's only 9 a.m. But it's not humidity that hits me as I climb out of the 4WD, rather the overwhelming smell of dog urine and feces. This is a makeshift shelter that should be housing a maximum of 400 dogs. Instead there are more than 1,700 animals being kept in large concrete pens at the compound. Staff work around the clock. This region is the heartland for the cruel and inhumane dog smuggling trade. The illegal operation sees an estimated 200,000 dogs transported in trucks from Thailand into neighboring Laos, across the Mekong River and driven across to Vietnam where the meat is considered a delicacy. Some believe it has medicinal qualities and acts as an aphrodisiac -- black dogs are apparently the best for sexual dysfunction. Yet no scientific proof has ever proved such a claim. The dogs at this shelter were intercepted more than a month ago after Thai authorities stopped several trucks trying to cross the border into Laos. The drivers were arrested but no one was prosecuted. Their cargo? Thousands of dogs crammed into small steel cages -- at least a dozen dogs to a cage -- where they are left for days on end without food or water, while the smugglers make their week-long journey. Some of the dogs die from suffocation along the way. Others endure broken bones and crushed skulls during the trip. And they're all disease ridden. These dogs were destined for restaurants in Vietnam where a single dog can be sold on average for $60 an animal. It's a lucrative business for smugglers, considering a dog fetches only a few dollars in Thailand. John Dalley, founder of the Phuket-based Soi Dog Foundation, moved to Thailand from the UK 10 years ago on a mission to help the country's overwhelming stray dog population. The charity, which relies on donations from animal-lovers around the world, set up an immunization program, and just last week neutered its 50,000th dog. There are now plans to expand the program nationwide. Dalley says the dogs would have endured an even more horrific ordeal if the truck hadn't been intercepted. ""At best, they could have been clubbed -- maybe unconscious, maybe not -- and had their throats slit in from of other dogs and they all know what's going on. At worst, they're skinned alive, strung up and beaten ... while alive, set on fire,"" he said. ""It's a horrendous death and that's what we're trying to stop. Never mind that it's illegal to do it -- it's the sheer inhumanity of this trade that this can still be going on in the 21st century."" While these dogs didn't end up on dinner plates in Vietnam, they were struck by disease that spread like wildfire through the shelter due to the overcrowding. ""This place should just be for dogs coming in, to get vaccinated and then to leave and move on to other shelters. But they're all full, if not overflowing, and these dogs desperately need loving homes,"" he said. The few that are cute, fluffy or pedigrees are swiftly adopted but the majority -- mangy strays and street dogs -- will never leave the concrete floors and wire fencing of the shelter. Chusak Pongpanit, chief of the Animal Quarantine Station, also knows the challenges in front of him. ""We still need a lot of funds because we will have to take care of these dogs for a long time before they can find homes -- if they find homes."" Meters away from the pens that divide the sick dogs and the healthy is a building that houses the critically ill. Skin hangs from their frail, skeletal bodies. Many are covered in sores, while others have mucus dangling from their noses --  often a sign of pneumonia, distemper or canine parvovirus infection. Last month, disease claimed 780 dogs. While we watch the veterinarians try to minimize pain and suffering, a dog takes its final breath and passes away on a stainless steel trolley. Marisa Goudie is one of several vets from the UK who have flown to Thailand, volunteering their time to help local staff try to stop the outbreak. The Soi Dog Foundation that supports the shelter with food, drugs and vaccinations put out an SOS last month and the Worldwide Veterinary Service, Animals Asia and the Humane Society International -- organizations based in the United States, Britain and the Philippines -- answered the call for help. ""It's heartbreaking being here. These dogs are inherently still wanting to trust humans after everything they've been through,"" said Goudie, as she pulled her stethoscope away from the bony ribcage of the dead dog. The challenge facing western veterinarian staff that have flown into assist is the Buddhist religious beliefs of the Thais that don't allow dogs to be euthanized. ""We do have our hands tied because of religious issues and that's something that internally we're conflicted with -- but we need to respect their views,"" Goudie explained. Hayley Walters is a veterinarian nurse based in Edinburgh, Scotland and arrived at the shelter just a few days ago. Not being able to put a dog out of its misery goes against every bone in her body. ""It's heartbreaking because in the western world we would help them on their way. But here we can only give palliative care -- make them as comfortable as possible. We give them pain relief, with the really skinny ones we give them some cardboard to sleep on and some kind words. But that's the saddest thing -- we can't send them on their way."" As for the relatively healthy ones, she can only try and remain optimistic that the rescue of these dogs means they have another chance at life. ""What they need is good treatment, good nutrition and loving homes to go to. This must not be the end place for any rescue dog. A shelter should not be the end place. It's a huge problem. if we could stop the root of the problem, which is the dog eating trade, we could stop this -- all of this."" But for now the multi-million dollar dog meat industry continues to thrive in parts of Asia, a harsh reality for animals affectionately referred to as ""man's best friend.""","Sanctuary on Thai-Laos border rescues dogs previously destined for dinner plates in Vietnam .

"Edward Snowden's father expressed satisfaction Wednesday with the way his son, the former National Security Agency contractor, has been treated since being granted asylum in August. Lon Snowden spoke to reporters at Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport as he prepared to return to the United States after a six-day visit, his first reunion with his son since April. ""I felt that this is the best place for him, this is the place where he doesn't have to worry about people rushing across the border to render him,"" Lon Snowden said. ""It's not going to happen here."" It may not be his last visit, since his son -- charged in the United States for revealing a massive government surveillance campaign -- may wind up remaining in Russia for years. ""My feeling is that, unless the attitude within our government changes dramatically -- and that at a minimum is going to require a change of administration and that's going to be in several years -- that Russia is the place for him to be at the current time."" NSA leaker Edward Snowden deserves a Nobel Prize, his father says . Though Russia granted Edward Snowden a one-year asylum, ""that could easily be extended,"" said his father, who described Moscow as modern and sophisticated. ""I could be comfortable living the rest of my life here; I'm certain that he could."" The elder Snowden, who arrived October 10 in Moscow, said the two visited several times. ""He is comfortable, he is independent, he is happy -- which is important to me -- and he is absolutely committed to the decision that he made."" Lon Snowden said his son told him he had had no contact with Russian security or intelligence. He added that he did not know where his son was living. ""I don't have an idea."" Edward Snowden, a 30-year-old former government IT contractor, collected information on spy programs -- in which the National Security Agency mined phone and Internet metadata from thousands of people inside and outside of the United States -- and exposed the program to the media. Anticipating legal consequences, he fled to Hong Kong in late May and flew on June 23 to Moscow, where he holed up at the airport for more than five weeks. U.S. authorities have charged him with espionage and theft of government property. After Russia granted him asylum on August 1, he left the airport. Snowden's father: 'I know my son. I know he loves his country.' Lon Snowden described his son as healthy and happy, with ""a very substantial"" international support network. He accused the news media of mischaracterizing what his son did. ""So many people are so determined in the media to continue to refer to him as a leaker,"" Lon Snowden said. ""In fact, he's a whistle-blower, by definition."" He said attempts have been made to demonize his son, but defended him. ""He is someone who shared the truth; he has enraged many politicians. Not only has he enraged them, he has put their political careers at risk, as they should be. People who were in positions of responsibility, of oversight."" The reunion came after times when Lon Snowden said he had not expected to see his son ever again. ""I hugged him; it was, 'I love you son,' 'I love you, Dad.' But we hugged a little longer, a little harder, and it was certainly -- it was an important moment."" Book deals have been dangled that could make his son a rich man, but ""that is not what Edward Snowden wants to do,"" his father said. Though Edward Snowden revealed the surveillance with the assumption that he would accept the consequences, that does not mean he regrets having fled the United States, nor does it mean he plans to return to face charges there, Lon Snowden said. ""That is absolutely absurd,"" he said. ""Nobody questions the decision that he has made, because he would be locked in a dark hole at this point, which certain people would love.""","""This is the best place for him,"" Lon Snowden says of his son, Edward .

"(CNN) -- Brazilian-born striker Brandao had been handed a six-month ban for headbutting Paris St Germain midfielder Thiago Motta at Parc des Princes on August 16. Brandao, who plays for French Ligue 1 side Bastia managed by Claude Makelele, assaulted the Italy international in the tunnel following the match which PSG won 2-0. The 34-year-old can be seen on CCTV waiting around before striking Motta and then running off out of shot with the PSG man following in hot pursuit. Brandao was playing in only his second match for the Corsica-based club after joining from Saint Etienne in the summer. He was suspended for four weeks following the attack which broke Motta's nose. Last season, he was banned for three matches for elbowing another PSG player, Yohan Cabaye, in the head. ""Brandao will be available to play again on Feb. 22, 2015,"" the French league's disciplinary committee said in a statement following a hearing on Thursday, meaning the striker will miss 24 league matches in total. Meanwhile in England Friday, Tottenham Hotspur defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto was given a three-game ban and fined £50,000 ($82,000) by the English Football Association (FA) for improper conduct after congratulating Nicolas Anelka on his ""quenelle"" gesture on social media. Anelka used the gesture, which involves pointing a straightened arm downwards while touching the shoulder of that arm with the other hand, while playing for West Bromwich Albion during a match last December. Some believe it to be a Nazi salute in reverse and it has been linked with anti-Semitism in France. Anelka, who was fined £80,000 ($130,000) and handed a five-match ban by the FA in February, denied being racist or anti-Semitic, saying the gesture was a dedication to French comedian Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala.","Brazilian-born striker earns six-month ban for headbutt on PSG midfielder Thiago Motta .

"(CNN) -- Maybe your mother told you it's not polite to stare. It wasn't safe either, NASA said, for those who looked at Thursday's partial solar eclipse. ""Don't stare,"" NASA said. ""Even at maximum eclipse, a sliver of sun peeking out from behind the Moon can still cause pain and eye damage. Direct viewing should only be attempted with the aid of a safe solar filter."" The show in the sky reached its height at 5:45 p.m. ET, NASA said, meaning the eastern half of the country should have gotten a view before the backdrop of golden twilight hues. The moon clipped the sun and should have made it look like a fingernail as it set in the west for most of the country and Canada. People living in the Central Time Zone had the best view, NASA said. New England and Hawaii will miss out on this one. The eclipse was expected to last for over two hours. Protect your eyes . NASA urged people viewing the eclipse to protect their eyes. NASA suggested some old tricks for viewing indirectly, like punching a hole in cardboard and projecting the light seeping through it onto a surface away from the sun. Or letting a tree do the work for you: ""Overlapping leaves create a myriad of natural little pinhole cameras, each one casting an image of the crescent-sun onto the ground beneath the canopy,"" NASA said. If you missed this one, the next solar eclipse over North America will occur in about three years -- and it will be a more dramatic and rare total eclipse.","NASA: Protect your eyes with special filters or indirect methods when viewing any eclipse .

"A man with a history of spouting anti-Semitic rhetoric is suspected of shooting to death a boy and his grandfather outside a Jewish community center near Kansas City, Kansas, and then a woman at a nearby Jewish assisted living facility. Police say Frazier Glenn Cross is the suspect in the shootings. And investigators had ""unquestionably determined"" that his actions were a hate crime, said Overland Park Police Chief John Douglass. Cross is the founder and former leader of the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and the White Patriot Party, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups. Both organizations operated as paramilitary groups in the 1980s, according to the SPLC. In the 73-year-old's anti-Semitic and white-supremacist activities, he has also used the name Frazier Glenn Miller, the SPLC said. After he was apprehended at a nearby elementary school, Cross sat in the back of a patrol car and shouted ""Heil Hitler!"" video from CNN affiliate KMBC shows. For now, Cross faces charges of premeditated first-degree murder, officials said. He obtained firearms from a ""straw buyer,"" a middleman with a clean record who could buy weapons legally and then sell or give them to Cross, allowing Cross to avoid federal background checks, a U.S. law enforcement official said. He had three guns when he was arrested Sunday, authorities said. Barry Grissom, the U.S. attorney for Kansas, told reporters Monday that he has ""received communications"" from U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder expressing Holder's ""concern and condolences."" ""We are in a very good place from an evidence standpoint of moving forward with this case and we will be presenting it to the grand jury in the not-too-distant future,"" Grissom said. If the suspected shooter is charged and convicted of a hate crime, under federal law, the death penalty could be on the table. That would apply if the charge is that the defendant was motivated by the victims' ""race, color, religion or national origin."" The shootings took place at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City and the Village Shalom Retirement Community in Overland Park a day before the start of Passover, a major Jewish holiday. ""The timing is terrible. The timing is awful,"" said Rabbi Herbert Mandl, a chaplain with the Overland Park police. The police chief said the gunman shot at five people; none of whom he is believed to have known. There were no other injuries, authorities said. Police were investigating statements the man made after his arrest but declined to provide additional details, Douglass said. The Anti-Defamation League said it warned last week of the increased possibility of violent attacks against community centers in the coming weeks, ""which coincide both with the Passover holiday and Hitler's birthday on April 20, a day around which in the United States has historically been marked by extremist acts of violence and terrorism."" On Monday, the ADL reissued a security bulletin to synagogues and Jewish communal institutions across the country, urging them to review their security plans for the Passover holiday, which begins at sundown Monday. 'That idiot...knocked a family to its knees' The shooting began just after 1 p.m. Sunday in the Jewish community center's parking lot. Inside, the center was a hive of activity. A performance of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was about to begin, and auditions were under way for ""KC Superstar,"" an ""American Idol""-style contest for the best high school singer in the Kansas City area. Outside, the gunman opened fire. Police said he was armed with a shotgun and may have been carrying other weapons. Reat Griffin Underwood, 14, was there to audition for the singing competition. His grandfather, William Lewis Corporon, was driving him. The bullets struck them in their car. Both died. Reat was a high school freshman active in debate and theater. He loved singing and performing in his church's choir, his uncle said. Corporon was a doctor who practiced family medicine in Oklahoma for many years before moving to the Kansas City area to be closer to his grandchildren, his family said. ""That idiot absolutely knocked a family to its knees for no reason,"" Reat's uncle and William's son, Will Corporon, said at a news conference Monday afternoon. ""My dad should be seeing patients today at his work. ... There is no reason. No reason for this. And it's just a tragedy."" Dr. Corporon worked 40 hours a week, and every free moment he had, he spent with his grandchildren, Will Corporon said. ""My father leaves a huge legacy of community and of healing,"" he said. ""And it's just unbelievable that a senseless, stupid act can cause so much hurt and grief and pain."" Mother: 'They were ambushed' Grandfather and grandson were Methodists, their pastor, the Rev. Adam Hamilton, told CNN on Monday. Since the shooting, he has tried to comfort Mindy Losen, who is William Lewis Corporon's daughter and Reat's mother. ""They are devastated but they have a real deep faith and strength of conviction,"" Hamilton said. ""They are overwhelmed with grief. They don't believe that this was God's will. This person was doing something evil and not keeping with God's will. They do believe that their loved ones are safe in the arms of God."" On Monday, Losen told reporters that she had been comforted by family, friends and faith. ""I feel confident from what I heard that they didn't feel anything. They didn't know what was coming. They were ambushed. ... It was a horrible act of violence,"" she said. ""My dad, our dad, and my son were at the wrong place at the wrong time for a split second. And we want something good to come out of this."" As she mourns her son's death, she said she's hoping his organs can be used in transplants. A woman caring for her mother . After the shooting started, the center went into lockdown. ""Some of these kids were taken into locker rooms and told to lay on the floor as the shots rang out,"" CNN affiliate KSHB reporter Lisa Benson told CNN. Jeff Nessel, a parent, told The Kansas City Star he had just dropped his 10-year-old son off at the community center when a staff member told him to get back inside because there had been a shooting. ""We'll keep you on lockdown. You're safe here,"" Nessel said a staff member told him. The gunman then drove to the retirement home, where he shot the third victim in the parking lot. Authorities identified her as Terri LaManno, who was visiting her mother as she usually did every Sunday at Village Shalom. LaManno's Catholic church, St. Peter's Parish, posted a message on its web site calling LaManno ""a loving mother and wife, and a gentle and giving woman."" The Children's Center for the Visually Impaired in Kansas City, where LaManno worked as an occupational therapist, described her as a ""gracious, generous, skilled and deeply caring individual who made a great difference in the lives of so many children and their families."" 'A raging anti-Semite' Cross is a ""raging anti-Semite"" who has posted extensively in online forums that advocate exterminating Jews, the Southern Poverty Law Center said. He has called Jews ""swarthy, hairy, bow-legged, beady-eyed, parasitic midgets."" According to the SPLC, Cross founded and ran the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1980s. He was forced to shut down after the SPLC sued him for operating an illegal paramilitary organization and intimidating African-Americans. He then formed another group, the White Patriot Party. In the late 1980s, Cross spent three years in prison on weapons charges and for plotting the assassination of SPLC founder Morris Dees. The short sentence was a result of a plea bargain he struck with federal prosecutors. In exchange, he testified against 14 white supremacists in a sedition trial in Arkansas in 1988. ""He was reviled in white supremacist circles as a 'race traitor,' and, for a while, kept a low profile,"" according to an SPLC profile of him. ""Now he's making a comeback with The Aryan Alternative, a racist tabloid he's been printing since 2005."" Connection with other shootings? The Jewish center shootings come as a spate of highway shootings in the Kansas City area have many residents on edge. Douglass said authorities don't have any information tying the highway shootings to Sunday's violence, but he said that's a possibility they'll consider. ""It's too early to tell,"" he told reporters on Sunday. ""We have no active information that would lead us in that direction. But the investigation is so early, as you might imagine, we will be working with the Kansas City, Missouri, police department to cover any lead and if that's a possibility.""","Police chief says that investigators have determined shootings a hate crime .

"(CNN) -- Quoting Ezekiel 25:17 from ""Pulp Fiction"" will likely get you laughed out of Sunday school class. That's because the Bible verse, as recited by Samuel L. Jackson's character, Jules Winnfield, doesn't actually exist. In the film, Winnfield speaks these words to people before he kills them: ""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."" The actual Bible verse says, ""I will carry out great vengeance on them and punish them in my wrath. Then they will know that I am the Lord, when I take vengeance on them.'"" Scripture isn't the only thing writer-director Quentin Tarantino took creative liberties with for the film that opened in theaters on October 14, 1994. In honor of ""Pulp Fiction's"" 20th anniversary, here are 20 fun facts about the movie that still reigns as one of the greats: . 1. Vincent Vega's trips to the bathroom . Potty breaks are bad news in this film. Whenever John Travolta's character, Vincent Vega, takes a powder, tragedy occurs. During his three bathroom breaks, Mia Wallace (played by Uma Thurman) overdoses, the restaurant where he and Jules are dining is held up, and Bruce Willis' Butch Coolidge gets the drop on him. 2. F'ed up . The F-word is used 265 times in the movie. Go ahead and count it. 3. The notebook . Fueled by the money he had made from his film ""Reservoir Dogs"" and the deal he had for ""Pulp Fiction,"" Tarantino took off to Amsterdam to write the latter. According to Vanity Fair, ""He bought school notebooks and declared about one of them, like a modern-day Hemingway, 'This is the notebook in which I am going to write Pulp Fiction.' "" He ended up filling several notebooks. 4. The Honda . Tarantino got a lot of use out of the Honda Civic that Butch drives in the film. It's the same car Pam Grier drives in the title role of ""Jackie Brown,"" and appears in a parking lot scene in ""Kill Bill: Volume 2."" 5. Oops with the coat . At the beginning of the now-infamous overdose scene, Mia is wearing Vincent's coat. Moments later she goes to light a cigarette and is no longer wearing it. The coat magically appears back on her once the cigarette is lit. 6. Robert Redford could have starred . Ronnie Yeskel, the film's casting director, told Flavorwire that unlike on ""Reservoir Dogs,"" Hollywood agencies ""were pitching Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman and Bruce, Bruce Willis -- just the biggest names in the business that you could imagine."" ""And we're sitting there in these rooms with all these suits, and they all look alike, and we're like kids in a candy store,"" Yeskel said. ""We couldn't believe they were pitching these people to us."" 7. Or Ellen . Ellen DeGeneres tried out for the role of Jody, the pierced face wife of Vincent's drug dealer, that ultimately went to Rosanna Arquette. 8. Kathy Griffin made it in as did ... Blink and you may miss her, but comedian Kathy Griffin appears in the scene where bad guy Marsellus Wallace and Butch collide. Griffin has said she used to date Tarantino. Steve Buscemi, who now stars in ""Boardwalk Empire,"" also made a cameo as the Buddy Holly waiter at Jack Rabbit Slim's. 9. Tricky camera work . The scene where Travolta's Vincent plunges a needle into the chest of Thurman's Mia to revive her from an overdose using adrenaline was filmed with Travolta pulling the needle out of her and then the film was run backward. 10. Jackson was convincing . Producer Richard Gladstein told Vanity Fair that when Jackson did his second audition for his role he showed up with a burger and fries -- key props in one of the film's pivotal scenes. The actor proceeded to consume the meal so menacingly that Gladstein said, ""I thought that this guy was going to shoot a gun right through my head."" 11. On drugs . One of Tarantino's friends, a recovering heroin addict, advised Travolta on how best to portray a man riding that horse. He told the actor that getting drunk on tequila while relaxing in a hot bath would closely approximate a heroin high without him actually having to do the drug. 12. That bad wallet . The director didn't have to look far for one of the film's most memorable props. Jules' wallet, which had ""Bad Mother F****r"" written on the front of it, actually belonged to Tarantino. 13. The watch transporter . When Captain Koons (Christopher Walken) tells a young Butch the story about the gold watch that was a family heirloom, he refers to a soldier named Winocki who transported it. Joe Winocki was the name of a character in the 1943 film ""Air Force,"" directed by Howard Hawks, one of Tarantino's personal heroes. 14. ""The Wolf"" No one else could have played the man who specialized in messy cleanups: Tarantino reportedly wrote the character of Winston ""The Wolf"" Wolfe specifically for Harvey Keitel. 15. The same pie . If Fabienne's line, ""Any time of day is a good time for pie,"" sounds familiar, it should. The character of Alabama says the same thing in another Tarantino film, ""True Romance."" 16. What's in the case? There have been countless theories about what was in that mysterious briefcase that Jules and Vinnie had to protect -- with everything from gold to Marsellus' soul being suggested. But Tarantino has said in interviews that it's whatever fans choose it to be, though he has also had fun with fans promising a ""reveal."" 17. Keeping it in the family . Travolta's character, Vincent Vega, is the brother of Vic Vega, aka Mr. Blonde, from Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs."" Michael Madsen played the character in that film. 18. The meaning of the Band-Aid . Marsellus sports a Band-Aid on the back of his neck for a reason: It covers up a scar actor Ving Rhames had. 19. The dance trophy . The audience is led to believe that Vincent and Mia won the dance contest at the Jack Rabbit Slim's restaurant. But late in the film, when Butch is returning to get his watch, there's a radio bulletin about the trophy having been stolen. 20. The Gimp had a wife . ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Julia Sweeney had a bit role in ""Pulp Fiction"" as a junkyard owner and The Wolf's breakfast date, Raquel. In real life, she had been married to Stephen Hibbert, who played The Gimp in the film.","Quentin Tarantino's film opened in theaters in October 1994 .

"After three days of poring over photos and video, investigators appealed to the public to help them identify two men now considered suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings. The men were photographed walking down Boylston Street, one behind the other, near the finish line of Monday's race. Suspect 1 was seen wearing a light-colored, collarless shirt underneath a dark-colored jacket and wearing a dark baseball cap. The man identified as Suspect 2 was seen setting down a backpack at the site of the second explosion ""within minutes"" of the blasts that killed three people and wounded nearly 180, said Special Agent Rick DesLauriers, the head of the FBI's Boston office. He was wearing a light-colored hooded sweatshirt, a black jacket and a white baseball cap turned backward. In particular, DesLauriers asked for help from anyone standing in front of the Forum restaurant, where the second bombing happened. ""Somebody out there knows these individuals as friends, neighbors, co-workers or family members of the suspects,"" DesLauriers said. ""And though it may be difficult, the nation is counting on those with information to come forward and provide it to us."" People with possible information on the two men were urged to go to the FBI's website, https://bostonmarathontips.fbi.gov, or call 800-CALL-FBI (800-225-5324). By Thursday evening, authorities already had received a ""large volume of calls ... as a result of the photos,"" an FBI official said.  The FBI's website, moreover, had been inundated with record traffic. It wasn't immediately known then whether any of the tips had led to the suspects. DesLauriers cautioned that anyone who think they know their identities should be careful, and consider them armed and ""extremely dangerous."" ""No one should approach them,"" he said. ""No one should attempt to apprehend them except law enforcement."" 'They acted differently than everyone else' Other footage, still unreleased, shows that the two suspects stayed at the scene to watch the carnage unfold, a federal law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN's Susan Candiotti. ""When the bombs blow up, when most people are running away and victims were lying on the ground, the two suspects walk away pretty casually,"" said the official, who has seen the unreleased video. ""They acted differently than everyone else."" While video of at least one suspect planting the bomb exists, the FBI had chosen not to release it, according to the official. One reason, according to the official, is that were the media to repeatedly show the suspects leaving the bomb, it might cause some people to overreact if they came into contact with them. DesLauriers said intelligence had been developed on the first suspect ""within the last day or so."" The official who spoke with CNN said images of the second suspect were isolated Wednesday. Flood of digital evidence a blessing and a curse . The investigation also turned toward the possibility that the bombs had been detonated by remote control, a federal law enforcement official briefed on the investigation said Thursday. Investigators contacted the maker of a battery found in the debris of the blasts, said Benjamin Mull, a vice president at Tenergy Corporation. One of the firm's batteries, typically used in remote-controlled hobby cars, was found in the aftermath of the attack, connected to some wires and a piece of plastic. In the early hours of the investigation, a law enforcement official told CNN that the bombs were probably detonated by timers. The FBI has said details of the detonating system were unknown. While the latest clues moved the investigation forward, it is still unclear whether the attack was an act of domestic or foreign terrorism. Bombers 'picked the wrong city,' Obama says . Thursday evening's FBI announcement capped a day in which President Barack Obama brought a mixture of reassurance and defiance to an interfaith memorial service in the city's Cathedral of the Holy Cross. Whoever planted the bombs ""picked the wrong city"" to attack, he said. ""Every one of us stands with you,"" Obama told the crowd. ""Boston may be your hometown -- but we claim it, too. ... For millions of us, what happened on Monday is personal."" Addressing the still-unknown perpetrators, Obama added: ""Yes, we will find you. And yes, you will face justice. We will hold you accountable."" And he looked ahead to next year's race, predicting that ""the world will return to this great American city to run even harder and to cheer even louder for the 118th Boston Marathon. Bet on it."" How we're affected as a nation by the bombing, other incidents . Among the crowd of about 2,000 were first lady Michelle Obama; the president's Republican challenger last November, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney; the state's current governor, Deval Patrick; and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. During an interlude, attendees were soothed by a performance by famed cellist Yo-Yo Ma. Menino praised each of the three bystanders who were killed in the blasts -- Martin Richard, described as a ""young boy with a big heart""; Krystle Campbell, whose spirit ""brought her to the marathon year after year""; and Lingzu Lu, who ""came to the city in search of an education."" The audience also included scores of police officers and other first responders. Crowds erupted in cheers as the cathedral emptied out at the end of the service, while others sang the national anthem. How to help . Obama also stopped at a high school to thank a group of first responders and volunteers and met with patients recovering from the attacks at Massachusetts General Hospital. ""It was extremely uplifting for them,"" said Dr. David King, a trauma surgeon at the hospital. ""I think it's incredibly inspiring that he would take time out and visit them and have a sincere interaction with all of these folks that have been hurt."" Obama ""was humbled by the patients' bravery and their fortitude and their drive to continue,"" he added. The first lady met with patients, families and hospital staff at Boston Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital, the White House said. The wounded: 59 still hospitalized . Investigators say the bombs, which exploded 12 seconds apart, were designed to deliver the most vicious suffering. A total of 59 people remained hospitalized on Thursday, six of them in critical condition, according to Boston-area hospitals. At least 13 people lost limbs as a result of the bombing. One device was housed in a pressure cooker hidden inside a backpack, the FBI said. The device also had fragments that may have included nails, BBs and ball bearings, the agency said. The second bomb was in a metal container, but it was unclear whether it was in a pressure cooker as well, the FBI said. Photos obtained by CNN show the remains of a pressure cooker found at the scene, along with a shredded black backpack and what appear to be metal pellets or ball bearings. They were sent to the FBI's national laboratory in Virginia, where technicians will try to reconstruct the devices. In the past, the U.S. government has warned federal agencies that terrorists could turn pressure cookers into bombs by packing them with explosives and shrapnel and detonating them with blasting caps. Family and friends, meanwhile, were mourning the three dead: . • Richard, the 8-year-old boy with a gap-tooth grin and bright eyes. He loved to run and play in his yard. • Campbell, a 29-year-old freckle-faced woman described by her mother as having ""a heart of gold."" • Lu, the Chinese graduate student at Boston University who had moved to the city last fall, making friends and soaking up new experiences. The U.S. State Department has been in contact with her family and the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement released Thursday. ""We stand ready to provide whatever appropriate assistance we can to the family members of foreign nationals in the aftermath of this despicable act of terror,"" Kerry said.","The FBI gets a ""large volume"" of calls after releasing photos of suspects, official says .

"Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a possible 2016 White House contender, said Tuesday that he would not be dissuaded by recent CNN poll numbers showing him trailing badly among New Hampshire Republicans. Only 3% of New Hampshire Republican primary voters backed him in CNN's September 8-11 survey. The governor finished at the bottom of a field of 11 potential presidential candidates. ""I think at this point polls are measuring name ID,"" Jindal told reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast in Washington. ""The first time I ran for office, I was ... polling within the margin of error, which means I was at zero."" ""There's no reason to be coy,"" he said. ""I am thinking, I am praying about whether I'll run in 2016."" The 43-year-old governor, who has been boosting his profile nationwide partly through his role as vice chairman of the Republican Governors Association, insisted that he would not make a final decision about a 2016 run until after the November midterm elections. ""If I were to decide to run for 2016, it would have nothing to do with polls or fundraising numbers,"" he said. ""It would simply be based on the same calculation that I made when I ran for ... Congress or governor. Do I think I could make a difference? Do I have something unique to offer in terms of my specific ideas or my experiences? Is this something that I'm supposed to be doing?"" Jindal used his appearance at the Monitor breakfast to unveil an energy proposal from his nonprofit group, America Next. The plan embraces an ""all of the above"" strategy but stresses the importance of continued development of domestic oil and gas through hydraulic fracturing and other means. Oil and gas play a particularly critical role in the Louisiana economy. Jindal blasted the Obama administration's refusal to move forward with the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. ""Right now, we've got an administration (of) science deniers when it comes to harnessing America's energy resources and potential,"" he said. Jindal fielded a wide range of questions from reporters at the breakfast. Among other things, he expressed his support for the administration's decision to strengthen U.S. efforts to combat the Ebola outbreak in Africa. ""I think it is important that we lean forward,"" the governor said. ""We've got certainly both a humanitarian basis as well as vested interest in wanting to help countries in Africa that are hardest hit."" Asked about efforts to confront ISIS in the Middle East, Jindal said Congress should back White House proposals to train and arm Syrian rebels. But he argued that repeated delays on the part of the administration had allowed the power of Islamic extremists to grow unchecked for too long. ""Our friends don't trust us; our enemies don't fear us,"" he said. Jindal tackled a number of subjects likely to prove popular with GOP primary voters, including the need for further spending controls and complaints of a ""war on religious liberty"" in the United States. For many conservatives, it is ""shocking"" to hear Obama ""speak so eloquently"" about ""the rights and protections of Christians overseas, while ignoring what (is) happening here at home,"" he said. Jindal called Obama the worst American president since Jimmy Carter. ""Carter believed in American exceptionalism. I don't think Obama does,"" he said. ""Obama's the most radical president, ideologically, in my lifetime. And I think he's the most incompetent president."" ""Jimmy Carter,"" he added, ""was just incompetent.""","Louisiana governor says he's not worried about a poll showing low support in New Hampshire .

"(CNN) -- One man's dream voyage is Karl Pilkington's nightmare. For the Science Channel's new reality series ""An Idiot Abroad,"" the British radio producer (who has acquired an international cult following as funnyman Ricky Gervais' favorite target) embarked on an all-expenses-paid, seven-country, several-month vacation -- and hated every second of it. ""I kept saying, 'I don't want to do this,' but [Gervais] was making me go,"" Pilkington said. ""I don't like it. You can have your money back -- but the cameraman's been paid, the director's been paid. I couldn't get out of it."" The lighthearted travel documentary, originally produced by Gervais and longtime collaborator Steve Merchant for Britain's Sky TV, follows a reluctant Pilkington to the Taj Mahal, the Great Pyramids and every ""World Wonder"" in between. In the show's first episode, which debuted in the United States on Saturday, Pilkington surveyed the hazy, mountainous Beijing skyline and frowned. The Great Wall of China stretched into the distance. ""Being honest with you, it's not the 'great' wall of China,"" he said. ""It's an all right wall. It's the 'All Right Wall of China.' "" Amid a crowd of photo-snapping tourists, Pilkington didn't hide his bemusement at more than 31,000 miles of historical (but recently renovated) stone. ""Am I missing something here?"" he said. ""So the old stuff's gone on it, really? Then it shouldn't be a Wonder then."" Back in London, Gervais cackled at Pilkington's candid reactions. ""I don't know the politically correct term -- moron. He's a round, empty-headed, chimp-like moron,"" Gervais remarked during the premiere episode, which attracted a loyal fan base in the UK in September. ""And he's a friend."" The show is a ""prank turned social experiment,"" Gervais said in the series preview. He and Merchant plotted region-specific activities (like toad chewing, traffic dancing and fortunetelling) to surprise the self-proclaimed recluse and immerse him, deeply and hilariously, in foreign cultures. Science Channel representative Debbie Myers said ""An Idiot Abroad"" broke network records for Saturday night ratings. An explosive response on Facebook and Twitter confirmed what Myers expected after the network landed the show for American television in November. ""It's a monster hit,"" she said. ""Karl brings cool, childlike wonder to the places he explores. Viewers can laugh while taking away an important lesson -- he inspires you to travel with your eyes wide open, live the adventure."" Pilkington, who said he'd rather have a quiet weekend by a beach in Spain or Italy, never wanted to live the adventure. When Gervais and Merchant couldn't persuade him to sign on, his girlfriend, Suzanne Whiston, pushed him to step out of his comfort zone. ""I blame her for this,"" he said. ""She said I'd regret passing this up, and I can't say no to her."" Much of Pilkington's reluctance stemmed from Gervais' habitual teasing. He knew the comedian, who has been his colleague since Pilkington began working on the ""The Ricky Gervais Show"" on London radio station Xfm in 2001, had designed every step of the journey for maximum discomfort. ""Ricky's always doing things to annoy me,"" he said. ""That's what keeps him alive, I think. Every day. I'm used to it now."" Of all the places Pilkington visited -- the eight-episode series takes viewers to China, India, Egypt, Jordan, Mexico, Brazil and Peru -- he said Beijing was one of the most bizarre. ""I don't know what the rules are there,"" he said of popular street food. ""I saw a woman eating a scorpion on a stick, and she was normal, wasn't a lunatic. Yet there she was, just eating a scorpion. Of all the creatures on the planet, they're the worst to look at.""

"(CNN) -- Extinctions, droughts, rising sea levels, bigger and more dangerous storm events; nature has been speaking to us. It's telling us we are taking too much from the planet and saving too little. My colleagues and I at Conservation International (CI) have been listening and now is the time for the world to act. The world's eyes are on Australia this week as both the G20 Leaders' Summit and the World Parks Congress -- that only happens once every 10 years -- take place. Both are significant international events whose outcomes will influence millions of lives around the globe for years to come. The timing of these two meetings is an opportunity to look into the future to define a sustainable pathway for future generations to responsibly and sustainably care for nature, our global biodiversity, for the well-being of all humanity. Both events will have a strong focus on improving human well-being and alleviating poverty without undermining environmental processes, natural ecosystems, or compromising our future. It's a tricky balance to strike. Governments and societies are faced with making difficult short and long-term choices. Those decisions can result in trade-offs between the provision of energy, food and water security, and creating and sustaining jobs and livelihoods, promoting economic development and conserving biodiversity and our natural areas all under a stabilized global climate. People have put tremendous stress on those benefits from nature to support our needs, and moving forward the pressure will only increase as our global population is estimated to increase to nine billion by 2050. Already we have seen some progress with emissions targets set this week by the U.S. and China. This is a major milestone not only in the US-China relationship but in the international climate agenda. It will set a new tone in the next round of climate negotiations where we need similar commitments by other industrialized and middle income nations. We believe the answer to these challenges is the inclusion of protected areas and other nature-based solutions as an integral part of our economic and development pathways. We know, from our projects around the world, that protected areas can provide significant environmental, social and economic benefits without great cost. A report from this year's Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) showed that every dollar invested in biodiversity conservation yields a $7 dollar return in environmental services, like clean air, food and fresh water provision. Increasing the number and size of these areas will ensure that essential food, water, energy, genetic diversity and climate securities continue to provide for us and future generations. To achieve truly sustainable development, however, we need policies, economic incentives, and practical tools and safeguards. More than 15% of Earth's terrestrial areas are now under some type of formal protection. More than 12% is in Indigenous People's and Community Conserved Areas and Territories. Marine protected areas also now cover more than 3% of the world's oceans. This represents tremendous momentum -- more ambitious than we were willing to hope for even at the last World Parks Congress. Large scale multi-national initiatives; such as the Guiana Shield and the Pacific Oceanscape have been transformational. The Guiana Shield is a tropical wilderness spanning six countries in South America. It contains about 25% of the world's remaining intact forest which holds vital carbon for climate regulation and produces as much as 10 to15% of the world's fresh water. The Pacific Oceanscape, a framework created by Pacific Island leaders for sustainable management and conservation, covers 10% of the world's total ocean surface and is home to the largest remaining healthy stocks of tuna. CI, and hundreds of other non-governmental organizations, governments, businesses, indigenous peoples, local communities and specialists at the World Parks Congress will work to continue this good work. This meeting of the minds has the potential to reconcile long-standing challenges to protect nature, support development and ensure human well-being. The outcomes from the Congress can serve as a roadmap towards a more sustainable future; one that has embedded protected areas in the decision-making process for development and has prioritized their role to define and deliver on the world's Sustainable Development Goals. It is our hope that this collective expertise and shared recommendation will provide key insight to the G20 leaders and influence their outcomes to ensure global economic development through a green and sustainable pathway. This week holds promise as a defining time for our generation and generations to come. This is our call to action, now let's deliver.

"(CNN) -- ""I'm here, where are you?"" It happens all the time. You're waiting to meet a friend and get a call or text like this. ""But I'm here,"" you insist. Even with addresses in hand, exact locations often remain elusive, and meet-ups get missed. The usual response -- a quick look around, squinting to make out some local landmark to tell them to meet you by -- might be okay for some. But having spent ten years in the music and events business, Chris Sheldrick was tired of spending his time telling suppliers, staff, and guests where to look for a venue's back or side entrance. In businesses like his, the small nuisance can become a timewasting burden: ""We always had this problem,"" he says. What3Words (W3W) believes it has found a solution. The start-up, co-founded last year by Sheldrick, divides the entire world into a grid of three meter by three meter squares -- 57 trillion of them in total. Each square has been labeled with a three word sequence. Standing beneath the Eiffel Tower? You're at ""shut.tech.requests."" Want to meet on the front doorstep of Buckingham Place? Tell a friend ""sound.manual.lungs."" Climbed to the top of Ayers Rock? That's ""snake.removes.gymnast"". ""Now, anyone can just say 'table.lamp.spoon' and it's much easier than giving a full address and explanation of how to find a location,"" says Sheldrick. In developed western countries, the precise system could be the answer to countless small problems, and over this summer the company has highlighted how W3W can help in jumbled music festival campsites, and sprawling parking lots. In the developing world, competing address systems can create confusion or, worse, no formal address system is present. How it works . Sheldrick knew the solution was already out there. Google Maps can give you GPS coordinates that will direct someone to a precise location. But remembering the 15 digit code -- or communicating one to a delivery driver down a dodgy phone line while organizing a busy event -- is bound to end in failure. ""For human beings, it's completely impractical,"" he says . What3Words has received $1.5m in start-up funding since it launched last year and the company is now expanding to incorporate more languages. With each new language -- English, Spanish, German, Russian, Italian, French, Turkish, and Portuguese are all available -- each square is assigned an additional name. There's almost 40,000 words of each language in the mix, but W3W has allocated the shortest, most commonly used ones to the areas where they're most likely to be used. So the front steps of the Swedish National Museum in Stockholm are called ""calf.router.shunted"" if you search in English, but the more common words ""skri.elev.skrika"" in Swedish. To streamline the process, Sheldrick explains that the team have removed all the homophones from the mix -- so you won't end up wondering if your friend said ""teas,"" ""tease,"" or ""tees"" -- as well as controversial spellings. Gone, too, are all those explicit words you that you probably wouldn't want to say to direct visitors to your front door. Unfortunately, language is rarely that simple and even three apparently innocent words, arranged appropriately -- say ""lazy.trouser.snake"" (a roadside plot just outside Hiroshima, Japan) -- are bound to haunt a few addresses. Sheldrick says there's no way of changing each allocated address, but that they haven't had any complaints yet. And, besides, a dodgy name has done no harm to many traditional addresses. Big impact? Sheldrick, meanwhile, is thinking big, and the company is pondering what role the three-word system could offer in countries where development can be obstructed by a lack of a reliable, intuitive, system of addresses. ""In a lot of the developing world, addresses are something governments have been working on for sometimes a decade,"" says Sheldrick. He believes, W3W can offer a ready-made system, allowing governments to forget what to call a place, and to focus on helping the people there.

"Former President Bill Clinton said Tuesday that although the conflict in Syria will mean ""an extended involvement"" for the United States, airstrikes in the region do not mean ""a prolonged involvement in a land war."" ""Yes, I think it will be going on awhile,"" Clinton said during an interview with CNBC's Becky Quick. ""I think we will be involved in this as long as someone is trying to have total control, particularly if it is ISIS."" Later, Clinton said, ""We don't need to be there on the ground and I don't think it means a land war in Iraq."" His earlier comments on a land war came in the context of Syria. A coalition of countries, including the United States, launched overnight airstrikes against the terrorist group ISIS in Syria. Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Qatar all participated in the operation, the U.S. military said. ""The strength of this coalition makes it clear to the world that this is not America's fight alone,"" President Barack Obama said on Tuesday before Clinton's comments. ""Above all, the people and governments in the Middle East are rejecting (ISIS) and standing up for the peace and security that the people of the region and the world deserve."" Clinton said that the conflict would not last for years and recognized that ""no one expects in the world we are living in now that every threat can be eliminated."" ""I think it will be an extended involvement with air power and with providing intelligence and other institutional support to the people who are fighting ISIS and trying to create a more inclusive set of governments in the Middle East,"" Clinton said. The former President, who in the past has been somewhat critical of Obama's Syria policy, said Tuesday that he backed the President's airstrikes. ""I actually think in this case the President, the administration's strategy has a chance to succeed,"" said the former President. ""But I wouldn't expect it the day after tomorrow, I think it is going to take awhile.""

"It was a seemingly wistful moment at the halfway mark of his presidency, before the celebratory parade and the evening's galas. Shortly after exhorting the United States to continue its ""never-ending journey"" to live up to the ideals of its founders, on his way off the platform at the West Front of the Capitol, President Barack Obama stopped to drink in the scene before him. ""I want to take a look one more time,"" he told those surrounding him. ""I'm not going to see this again."" And so, with his oath of office taken -- again -- and the speech delivered, the president stood aside for 24 seconds on the chilly Monday afternoon, letting the crowd that had joined him for his formal, public second inauguration file past. It was one of the few quiet moments on an otherwise jam-packed day. Obama stole another such moment with his wife, at the first of two official inaugural balls they were scheduled to attend Monday night. Obamas party with 30,000 close friends . Following performances by Alicia Keys, Brad Paisley and the Mexican rock group Mana, the first couple danced as Jennifer Hudson sang the classic song, ""Let's Stay Together,"" by Al Green. First lady Michelle Obama wore a floor-length, custom, ruby-colored chiffon and velvet gown designed by Jason Wu, the same designer behind her 2009 inaugural dress. The celebrations came a day after Obama was sworn in on the constitutionally required date in a low-key ceremony at the White House. The flag-waving crowd that watched Monday's event was noticeably smaller than the throng that turned out for his first oath in 2009 but still packed the National Mall for blocks. The waving flags, the red-white-and-blue bunting and the heralding trumpets marked the 57th such ceremony in the history of the nation, with the peaceful extension of power based on last November's election that returned Obama to the White House. The best Inauguration Day tweets . The Sousa marches, the ceremonial guns and the voices of James Taylor, Kelly Clarkson and Beyonce having faded away, Obama headed into the Capitol for a luncheon with members of Congress. Then he led the traditional parade up Pennsylvania Avenue, stopping near the White House to walk a few blocks of the route with the first lady to the cheers of those lining the sidewalks. ""You've got to come out for this,"" said Nick Pignone, a Washington resident. ""Everyone's excited -- good vibes right now."" Also publicly sworn in for a second term was Vice President Joe Biden, who, like Obama, also took his official oath Sunday. Justice Sonia Sotomayor performed the honors for Biden at his home at the Naval Observatory in Washington, where the vice president's extended family and a few Cabinet officials gathered to watch the ceremony. Biden and his wife, Jill, also took some time to walk part of the parade route, with a grinning Biden periodically jogging over to the sidelines to shake hands with people across the barricades. Once both couples and their families were seated at the White House reviewing stand, one of the first acts to pass was the marching band from Honolulu's Punahou School, Obama's alma mater. What followed included dozens of military and school bands, Native American dance troupes whirling in traditional dress, war veterans, Civil War re-enactors, kilted firefighters blowing bagpipes and Montana's governor and congressional delegation on horseback and in cowboy hats. 10 opinions: Explaining Obama's speech . Obama, the first African-American president and the 17th to win a second term, used a pair of Bibles in Monday's ceremony -- one from Abraham Lincoln, the other from Martin Luther King Jr. His roughly 2,000-word inaugural address hearkened back to both. ""I did everything possible today to keep from crying,"" said U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, a onetime lieutenant of King. He called the sight of Obama using King's Bible ""very moving, unreal -- almost unbelievable."" Monday is also the federal holiday commemorating the birthday of King, who was assassinated in 1968. The loudest cheer of Obama's address came when he said the nation's journey remained incomplete ""until our wives, our mothers, and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts,"" and ""until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law."" Obama embraces key social justice movements in inaugural address . Obama begins the second half of his presidency with the opportunity to make it more historic but facing some of the same challenges that he struggled with in the first four years. Americans ""have the power to set this country's course,"" he said, urging people to fulfill their citizenship by meeting ""the obligation to shape the debates of our time -- not only with the votes we cast, but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals."" On the Mall, Carlos Arieta and his wife, Sharon, took in the scene after driving from Atlanta to witness history. The former Washington residents said it was the first time they had attended an inauguration. Surprised by the throngs gathered a few hours before the speech on a clear morning with temperatures just above freezing, Arieta said ""it's nice to see all the different kinds of people."" Even some of those who didn't support Obama's November re-election turned out to watch. Don King, 27, and his 21-year-old brother Matthew said they don't agree with the president on taxation, debt and other fiscal issues but didn't want to miss this bit of history. ""It's the second inauguration for Obama, and it's pretty amazing if you think back to the 1800s and later during the civil rights era, that we're here,"" Don King said. Obamas, Bidens participate in National Day of Service . A new CNN/ORC International poll released Monday indicated less excitement this time than four years ago, when nearly 2 million people crowded the Mall despite frigid weather for Obama's historic first inauguration. In January 2009, nearly seven in 10 Americans questioned in a CNN survey said they were thrilled or happy that Obama was about to take office. Now, according to the new, that number is down 18 points, to 50%. Back then, six in 10 saw Obama's inauguration as a celebration by all Americans of democracy in action, with just 39% saying it was a political celebration by the supporters of the winning candidate. Now, the numbers are nearly reversed, with 62% saying the second inauguration is a celebration by those backing the president, and 35% saying it's a celebration of democracy. ""The thrill is gone, along with the hope that the start of a new presidential term of office will bring a divided nation together,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. Gergen: Obama 2.0 -- tougher, wiser? Reality of second-term presidencies . The smaller crowd this time around reflects the reality of second-term presidencies, when the novelty and expectations of a new leader have been replaced with the familiarity and experiences of the first act. For Obama, that difference is even sharper. His historic ascendancy to the White House in 2008 came with soaring public hopes and expectations for a new kind of governance that would close the vast partisan gulf developed in recent decades. However, a litany of challenges, including an inherited economic recession and repeated battles with congressional Republicans over budgets and spending, only hardened the opposing positions in Washington. Obama's signature achievements, including major reforms of the health care industry and Wall Street, became symbols of political division, with opponents constantly accusing him of hindering needed economic recovery. Obama's unfinished business and battles ahead . For his second term, Obama has vowed to press for an overhaul of the nation's immigration policies and new ways to boost the sputtering economy, proposals that are bound to spark battles with his Republican rivals, and oversee the implementation of Obamacare. And the shootings at a Connecticut elementary school last month put the divisive issue of gun control on his immediate agenda. CNN polling released Sunday showed a majority of Americans -- 54% -- believe Obama will be an outstanding or above average president in his second term, while 43% said he'd be poor or below average. And while overall, seven in 10 Americans hope the president's policies succeed, only four in 10 Republicans feel that way, with 52% hoping that Obama will fail. Obama's second-term priorities . But House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, told CNN, ""Today is the day for all of us in this country to come together."" ""I think the president did a fine job, certainly, laying out what he would like to see happen as far as the future of the country,"" Cantor said. ""There are areas of disagreement, but there are also some things fundamentally we agree on, and that is this country is one of opportunity. And sort of the way we get there to help everybody, there are some differences. Hopefully, we can bridge those differences.""

"(CNN) -- Proponents of marriage equality for lesbians, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons had been on quite a winning streak -- every federal district court, save one in Louisiana, had found a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. Four federal courts of appeal -- one rung below the U.S. Supreme Court, have reached that same conclusion, with same-sex marriage now legal in conservative states like Utah, Oklahoma and Idaho. As a result of the Supreme Court's refusal to hear these cases, 32 states and the District of Columbia now allow same-sex marriage. This string of victories, however, came to a halt on November 7, when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, on a 2-1 vote, became the first federal appellate court to uphold same-sex marriage bans. In the decision, DeBoer v. Snyder, the court dodged addressing the real issue -- the impact of same-sex marriage bans on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons. Instead, it focused on a different question -- should courts or the people through democratic processes be making decisions about marriage? In framing the issue in such a way, the court suggested that judges should not be making such decisions. The court is wrong. It is critical for the judiciary system to play a role in our constitutional process. The Constitution is designed to protect minority groups against the tyranny of the majority, who otherwise could legislate away all sorts of rights absent the protections found in the Bill of Rights and elsewhere. Oddly, many people who would decry this supposed judicial usurpation of democratic processes in the context of same-sex marriage are likely the same as those who lauded the Supreme Court's striking down of gun restrictions in Washington, D.C. and Illinois in District of Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago, respectively. Yet, the scenario is exactly the same. Invalidating gun restrictions and same-sex marriage bans rest on the same principle -- courts strike down laws that were adopted through the democratic process but that run afoul of rights protected by the Constitution. When the Supreme Court struck down the gun restrictions in those cases, it, too, was disrupting the outcome of our democratic processes. Yet gun rights proponents did not suggest that the Court's decisions were somehow illegitimate. Instead, the decision was about protecting the rights of people, in those cases, the rights of gun owners. The same is true with same-sex marriage bans -- protecting the rights of people against a majority who, for whatever reason, does not care for them or their relationships. One could argue that the situations are different because the Second Amendment clearly articulates a ""right to bear arms,"" whereas courts are merely manufacturing rights under the guise of ""due process"" and ""equal protection."" But, that argument doesn't survive a closer look. The Second Amendment is vague, too. The Second Amendment states ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" But, what exactly are ""arms""? Only the weapons around when the amendment was adopted, so that Congress can't ban muskets but can ban anything else? If the meaning ""arms"" changes over time, then where do we draw the line -- bazookas, tanks, or nuclear weapons? Clearly, there is no constitutional right to own any of those. The language of the Second Amendment requires judicial interpretation to flesh out its limits. To be clear, I disagree with the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Second Amendment and would have preferred that the court uphold those gun control laws. But I do not think that those decisions reflect an illegitimate act of judicial usurpation of the democratic process. The same dynamic is taking place with the same-sex marriage cases. The courts are explaining what the protections of ""due process"" and ""equal protection"" mean. If states have violated the rights of LGBT persons by denying them access to civil marriage without sufficient justification, it is not only legitimate for the courts to strike down the bans, it is also their obligation to do so. As the dissenting judge at the Sixth Circuit rightfully and eloquently explained, ""If we in the judiciary do not have the authority, and indeed the responsibility, to right fundamental wrongs left excused by a majority of the electorate, our whole intricate, constitutional system of checks and balances, as well as the oaths to which we swore, prove to be nothing but shams."" The majority in the Sixth Circuit ignored this reality, as well as the four other appellate courts that concluded otherwise -- that they had the obligation to decide these issues. Now that there is disagreement among the federal appellate courts on this issue, the Supreme Court will have to intervene. Let's hope the Supreme Court recognizes its obligation to decide these issues by protecting the rights of LGBT persons and opening the doors of marriage to same-sex couples.","Tim Holbrook: For the first time, a federal appellate court upholds same-sex marriage bans .
Holbrook: Court should decide on the issue rather than letting the people decide .

"New York (CNN) -- Emergency crews on Wednesday rescued two window washers who were trapped on a hanging platform dangling perilously at the 68th floor of the 1,776-foot One World Trade Center building in lower Manhattan. Rescue workers used a diamond saw to tear through three layers of glass panes -- the thickest nearly two inches -- to pull the workers to safety about 2:15 p.m., authorities said. The men were taken to Bellevue Hospital Center with mild hypothermia, police said. The workers had been tethered inside the apparatus, fire officials said. Additional personal safety cables were lowered from the roof of the 104-story building. ""I see two heads dangling over the scaffolding and one of the guys -- they just keep looking down,"" Reginald Moye, who watched the incident unfold from the 24th floor of a nearby hotel, told CNN. ""They look like they're maybe five feet in the middle of the scaffold, hanging."" A cable on one side of the hanging platform developed slack, leaving it suspended in a near-vertical position, authorities said. The cause was under investigation. The men were identified as Juan Lizama, 41, of New Jersey, and Juan Lopez, 33, of the Bronx, according to 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, which represents about 600 window cleaners in New York City. Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said emergency personnel from the NYPD, the New York Fire Department and Port Authority police practiced a rescue from such a rig 10 days ago. ""They were more than ready to operate here,"" he told reporters. ""The result: two men are going to go home tonight."" But it wasn't easy. ""In this case, the glass is three layers thick and, of course, they're 68 stories up,"" Nigro said. ""It does present a little more of a challenge."" Television images showed the rig dangling precipitously at a sharp angle. A Twitter photo from the fire department showed the rig as seen from inside the tower, with New York Harbor and the Statue of Liberty in the distance. Officials said emergency workers communicated with the window washers via a portable radio lowered by rope from the roof. The men worked for a company called Upgrade, according to Erica Dumas, a spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. ""They were going up, washing the windows, and I was amazed at the view,"" Moye said. ""Wow. Such a dangerous job. So, suddenly, I didn't see it collapse, but once I looked over and said, something is wrong, it was dangling."" Officials at Tractel, the company that designed, built and installed the window-washing rig, had no comment. Tractel also designed the scaffolding that collapsed at the Hearst Tower in Manhattan in June 2013, according to aerial and CNN footage of both scenes. In the 2013 incident, two workers were rescued more than 550 feet above the streets of midtown Manhattan after their scaffolding buckled near the top of the tower, fire officials said. The workers, who spent 90 minutes dangling near the top of the building, suffered no injuries. Firefighters cut through a double-paned window on the 45th floor and brought the workers in through the newly created hole. At 1,776 feet tall, the One World Trade Center building surpassed Chicago's 1,451-foot Willis Tower as the nation's tallest building. The new building officially opened November 3, when the first tenant, publishing company Conde Nast, moved in. Many of the floors remain unoccupied. It is the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, with a 408-foot spire atop the 1,368 foot tower. Its predecessor, the Twin Towers, were destroyed 13 years ago when al Qaeda terrorists flew two hijacked passenger jets into the buildings, killing 2,753 people on September 11, 2001. Asked if emotions surrounded the rescue, fire department Lt. Billy Ryan said: . ""It's business. The task at hand is what you worry about. You separate yourself from that. This is business."" CNN's Steve Kastenbaum, Laura Ly, Lorenzo Ferigno, Renee Wunderlich, Leigh Remizowski and Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.","Two window washers rescued from window-washing rig high above Manhattan .

"Congressional Democrats revealed new documents on Friday indicating the Internal Revenue Service subjected both liberal and conservative organizations to additional tax scrutiny in recent years, raising new questions about assertions of unfair politically based targeting. Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House committee investigating the matter, asked his GOP counterpart to summon the Treasury Department's chief investigator, J. Russell George, to a panel hearing scheduled for next Thursday. ""Given the new documents obtained by the committee ... I believe it is necessary to call (George) back before the committee to explain why he failed to disclose this critical information,"" Cummings wrote in a letter to California Rep. Darrell Issa, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Cummings blasted the behavior of George and Issa, arguing that the IRS probe ""has been characterized by one-sided and partial information leading to unsubstantiated accusations with no basis in fact."" Issa and other Republicans have insisted for months that after President Barack Obama was first elected, the IRS started unfairly targeting conservative outfits seeking tax-exempt status. Conservative group takes IRS, top Obama officials to court . Cummings and his fellow Democrats argue the IRS improperly scrutinized groups on both the left and right as part of a clumsy attempt to administer vague election-related tax laws. Among other things, Cummings on Friday released slides from a July 2010 workshop PowerPoint presentation instructing IRS agents to watch for organizations with names like ""Tea Party,"" ""Patriots,"" ""9/12 Project,"" and ""Progressive."" One of the slides shows a picture of an elephant and a donkey -- the symbols of the Republican and Democratic parties. Another slide notes a concern that the activities of such groups ""may be more than 50% political,"" thereby ruling out the possibility of tax-exempt status under current law. 'Angry' Obama announces IRS leader's ouster . Notes from the workshop indicated that ""if in doubt,"" IRS staff should ""err on the side of caution"" and transfer cases to ""7822,"" the IRS office in Cincinnati responsible for reviewing applications for tax-exempt status. The word ""progressive"" was again cited as an organization name that should trigger a review. Cummings also revealed a May 2013 e-mail from George's deputy noting that 5,500 internal IRS e-mails were reviewed as part of an effort to discover any directing of staff to target ""Tea Party and other political organizations,"" as well as any subsequent coverup. ""There was a Be On the Lookout (BOLO) list specifically naming these groups,"" the deputy inspector general's e-mail notes.  ""However, the e-mails indicated the organizations needed to be pulled because the IRS employees were not sure how to process them, not because they wanted to stall or hinder the application."" The deputy's e-mail goes on to stress that ""there was no indication that pulling these selected applications was politically motivated."" In his letter to Issa, Cummings said, ""It is unclear why Mr. George failed to disclose this significant information to Congress."" A report released by George's office in May indicated that lax oversight at the IRS allowed for the singling out of some conservative groups. George subsequently testified that he could not specifically identify whether any liberal groups were similarly targeted. ""This new information underscores the fact that the Treasury inspector general's audit was fundamentally flawed and created widespread misperceptions that Republicans seized on in an effort to attack the White House,"" said Michigan Rep. Sander Levin, another top House Democrat. ""It is now all the more important that Inspector General George return to Congress to explain his glaring omissions and reasons for releasing a highly misleading report."" A spokesman for Issa, however, drew a different conclusion, highlighting the fact that the workshop minutes noted that an IRS ""Tea Party Coordinator/Reviewer"" said that 'Progressive' applications are not considered 'Tea Parties.'"" ""These documents, once again, refute misleading attempts to equate routine scrutiny of other groups involved in advocacy to the systematic scrutiny of Tea Party groups by IRS officials,"" spokesman Ali Ahmed told CNN. ""As has been documented, while 100% of Tea Party applications were systematically stopped and scrutinized for a 27-month period, at the same time dozens of progressive applications were approved by the IRS,"" Ahmed said, referencing a June 26 letter from George to Levin. In a statement released Wednesday, Issa said, ""IRS officials have told committee investigators that they understood Tea Party applications were being isolated from other cases and subjected to extra scrutiny to ensure fair, efficient, and consistent treatment."" ""The evidence gathered in this investigation makes clear that had Washington IRS officials simply kept their hands off these cases and allowed employees in the Cincinnati office to process applications independently, instead of facing excessive delays, these cases would have been processed just like other advocacy cases,"" he concluded.","Democratic Rep.

"Republican Cory Gardner has opened up a four-point lead in a Colorado Senate race that's key in determining whether Democrats can hold onto their majority, a new CNN/ORC poll shows. Gardner held a 50 percent to 46 percent edge on first-term Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in the survey of 665 likely voters, conducted Oct. 9-13. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points. Republicans have targeted Udall and several other Democratic incumbents in their effort to win at least six seats this fall -- enough to gain a Senate majority for President Barack Obama's final two years in office. Traditional Democratic advantages among women and urban voters aren't enough to overcome strong headwinds, said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""Udall is getting clobbered in the all-important suburbs, as well as in rural areas, and his lead in Colorado cities is not enough to overcome that,"" Holland said. ""There is a gender gap, but in this case it appears to be working in favor of the Republican.  Udall has a nine-point advantage among women, but that is dwarfed by the 20-point lead Gardner has among men,"" he said. Hurting Udall is an underwater favorability rating of 45 percent -- with 51 percent of those surveyed saying they have an unfavorable opinion of the Democrat. Gardner, meanwhile, is viewed favorably by 50 percent of likely voters, with just 42 percent saying their opinion of him is unfavorable. Colorado's governor's race is even closer. Incumbent Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper is backed by 49 percent of likely voters, while Republican challenger Bob Beauprez has 48 percent support, the CNN/ORC poll found. The Democratic incumbents are both outperforming Obama, who twice won the state's nine electoral votes but now has an approval rating of just 39 percent in Colorado, while 59 percent of likely voters say they disapprove of the job he's doing.","A CNN/ORC poll finds Republican Cory Gardner is leading Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, 50-46.

"Washington (CNN)Republican Dan Sullivan has defeated incumbent Sen. Mark Begich in Alaska, CNN projects Wednesday. ""Today, we are going to begin the process of turning our country around and building a brighter future for our children,"" Sullivan said in a statement. An updated vote tally from the Alaska Division of Elections has Sullivan leading Begich, 48.6% to 45.4%, as of Wednesday morning. Republicans will now have at least 53 seats in the U.S. Senate next year, with one final race to be decided in Louisiana in a Dec. 6 run-off. Begich, a first-term incumbent, faced off against Sullivan, a first-time candidate originally from Ohio, who sought to nationalize the race by calling the senator a ""rubber stamp"" for President Barack Obama, who polls poorly in the deeply red state. As a senator, Begich voted for Obama's signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, which has become a lightning-rod issue in the state and in other competitive races across the country. Begich is the fourth Democratic Senate incumbent defeated in the Nov. 4 election. For most of the contest, polling data showed him trailing Sullivan, leading Republicans to identify the state as an opportunity to gain a Senate seat on the hunt to wrest back control of the upper chamber. During the race, Sullivan highlighted his conservative stances like reining in federal spending, limiting abortions and expanding infrastructure in rural areas of the state. Begich deflected attacks about his similarities to Obama by centering his campaign around local issues like his opposition to privatizing Social Security, support for veterans programs and increased funding and research for oil and renewable energy in the oil-rich state. In a campaign ad, Begich drew a line in the sand between himself and the president, citing political differences on issues like Arctic drilling and gun rights. ""I am not his candidate,"" Begich said, admitting that he did vote for the president in 2008 and 2012. CNN's Robert Yoon and Steve Brusk contributed to this report.","Republican Dan Sullivan defeated Democratic Sen. Mark Begich in Alaska .

"The Loi Krathong festival has been celebrated throughout Thailand for centuries, usually to mark the end of the rainy season. Each year, thousands of paper lanterns are released into the night sky to symbolically ward off bad luck, while rivers are covered by floating flower lanterns, adorned with candles and joss sticks, cast into waterways to wish for good luck. With flower and flame, the city of Chiang Mai in particular comes alive during these festive days each November. The event has been transformed over the years from a reverent temple ritual to a rowdy street party that lasts for days. ""The real meaning of the festival is to worship Buddha and the goddess of the river,"" says Sarah Wahtong a native of Chiang Mai. But now it's a magnet for foreign and local tourists with dozens of events and parades taking place throughout the city each day and night. While the carefully crafted floating flower lanterns don't disrupt the city with anything more than banana leaves and blooms, the flying lanterns have a potentially more hazardous impact. During this year's festival, like years gone by, dozens of flights from the local airport had to be diverted or canceled the moment thousands of lanterns took to the air. It seems that despite threats of fines and prosecution, Chiang Mai residents and visitors alike chose to respect the ancient traditions rather than modern laws. Legal or not, it did create a dazzling spectacle in the night sky.","Loi Krathong lantern festival has been celebrated in Thailand for centuries .

"President Barack Obama said the effort that led to the release of two Americans held in North Korea did not involve ""high level policy discussions"" or talks about the country's nuclear program. ""We had an indication that there was a possibility of a release of these two hostages, prisoners, and we pursued it,"" Obama said Monday in Beijing during his bilateral meeting with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. The president landed in China earlier in the day for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings. Obama wades into foreign policy challenges on Asia trip . Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller, the last two American citizens known to be held by North Korea, were released after James Clapper, U.S. director of national intelligence, went to Pyongyang, a senior administration official told CNN on Saturday. Clapper carried with him a letter from Obama addressed to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Why now? North Korea's release of Bae, Miller raises questions . In his comments Monday, Obama said the talks that involved the Americans' release ""did not touch on some of the broader issues that have been the source of our primary concern when it comes to North Korea."" He said it's a ""good news story"" but argued there's still a ""broader fundamental conflict"" with North Korea over is nuclear capacity. Obama suggested that in addition to ""small gestures like the ones that we saw with the release of these individuals,"" it will take ""a broader understanding"" by North Korea that countries in the region consider their top priority to be the prevention of a nuclearized Korean peninsula. ""And up until this point at least we have not seen serious engagement on the part of Pyongyang to deal with that problem,"" he said.

"As the furor mounts in Brazil over reports that the United States spied on President Dilma Rousseff and her advisers, the South American country's foreign minister was in Washington on Wednesday. U.S. National Security Advisor Susan Rice told Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Alberto Figueiredo that the United States is committed to working with Brazil to address its concerns, the White House said in a statement. But in Brazil, debate over media reports about alleged National Security Agency spying showed no signs of cooling. Brazilian lawmakers say they plan to send a commission to Russia to speak directly with former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who reportedly leaked documents cited in Brazilian media reports about the alleged espionage operations. Reports from Globo TV citing Glenn Greenwald, a Brazil-based journalist who obtained documents from Snowden, claim that Rousseff and the state oil company Petrobras were among the targets of the NSA. CNN has not independently verified the reports, which drew sharp condemnation from Brazilian officials this month. A foreign relations committee in Brazil's Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday approved a trip for lawmakers to travel to Moscow and interview Snowden over the matter, state-run Agencia Brasil reported. Lawmaker Ivan Valente said authorities wanted more information, not just what had been leaked to the media. ""The leaked information is an issue of national sovereignty,"" he said, according to Agencia Brasil. ""First, Brazilian citizens were spied on. Then companies, the president of the republic, ministers and now Petrobras."" Earlier this month, Brazil summoned the U.S. ambassador over the reports. And Rousseff has threatened to cancel her scheduled state visit to Washington in October. In Washington, officials emphasized U.S.-Brazil ties, while acknowledging the tension over the spying claims. '""National Security Advisor Rice expressed to Foreign Minister Figueiredo that the United States understands that recent disclosures in the press -- some of which have distorted our activities and some of which raise legitimate questions for our friends and allies about how these capabilities are employed -- have created tensions in the very strong bilateral relationship we have with Brazil,"" the White House said in a statement. Reports from Brazil's Globo TV over the alleged espionage have also drawn Mexico's ire, with allegations that the NSA spied on Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. U.S. President Barack Obama said he promised to look into the allegations when he spoke with Peña Nieto and Rousseff at last week's G-20 summit in St. Petersburg. ""What I assured President Rousseff and President Peña Nieto is...that I take these allegations very seriously,"" Obama told reporters. ""I understand their concerns; I understand the concerns of the Mexican and Brazilian people, and that we will work with their teams to resolve what is a source of tension."" The diplomatic tensions with Brazil and Mexico are the latest international fallout over documents leaked by Snowden, who faces espionage charges in the United States and is now living in Russia after authorities there granted him temporary asylum. Reports of U.S. espionage also roiled European officials over the summer after Germany's Der Spiegel and Britain's The Guardian published stories alleging that the NSA had targeted European government offices.","National Security Advisor Susan Rice meets with Brazil's foreign minister .

"Portland, Oregon, is so quirky that locals just take it for granted. For those still operating under a normal paradigm, here are five things you will find only in Portland: . A doughnut shop where you can get married. It was a sad day in Portland when its longtime 24-Hour Church of Elvis, a roving storefront art installation dispensing marriage licenses and 25-cent pop culture trinkets, closed this summer. Luckily, Voodoo Doughnut was there to fill in the gap. This cash-only, 24/7 doughnut shop performs about 400 legal weddings a year. It was started in 2003 by Tres Shannon, a flamboyant one-time mayoral candidate, and Kenneth ""Cat Daddy"" Pogson to feed the hangover crowd. The FDA eventually put the kibosh on the Nyquil, Robitussin and Pepto-Bismo doughnuts, but their signature voodoo doughnut lives on. It's shaped like a gingerbread man and comes with a pretzel stick in the belly for stabbing and drawing blood, er, raspberry jelly. As for weddings, which come with coffee and doughnuts for up to 60 guests, Pogson says his favorite involved a groom in a psychedelic suit who brought his mother in an urn. An ice cream counter that tops sundaes with worms. At the Freakybuttrue Peculiarium, an art gallery, novelty shop and cafÃ© in Portland's Alphabet District, you can pick up everything from zombie slippers and fake dog poop to plastic eyeballs to float in your gin and tonics. Lots of people show up just to pet Bigfoot (he's 10 feet tall, so you need a ladder), leave a message in the neon graffiti room or perform an autopsy on a life-size space alien. Daring sorts belly up to the ice cream counter for sundaes, hot dogs and other treats sprinkled with real bug larvae. Tempting as it is to think ""Sparky,"" the on-display ventriloquist-murdering dummy, is the mastermind behind this house of terror, it was actually started by filmmaker Mike Wellins and two friends. A museum where vacuum cleaners are out of the closet.  Stark's Vacuum Cleaner Museum -- where you won't find crumbs, cobwebs or a single dust bunny -- will sweep you off your feet. More than 100 vintage vacuums from the late 1800s up to the 1960s are on display in a 10-foot-by-40-foot wing of Stark's Vacuums in downtown Portland. Other than during the summer of 2012, when the Vacuum Cleaner Collectors Club convened at this Smithsonian of Sucking Machines, the little museum averages about a dozen visitors a month who come to ogle rare pre-electricity hand-pumped vacs, a cardboard model from the penny-pinching 1930s, an Electrolux on runners and a Duntley Pneumatic that attaches to the ceiling. Needless to say, the museum's carpet is spotless. A city park that can fit only one person at a time. Mill Ends Park, the world's smallest, is a 2-foot circle and, according to legend, houses the only leprechaun colony west of Ireland. It was dedicated on St. Patrick's Day 1948 after the light pole for which it was intended never appeared. Instead, newspaper columnist Dick Fagan planted flowers, and Patrick O'Toole, the colony's so-called head leprechaun, approved, at various times, such park installations as a swimming pool for butterflies. It even had a diving board and a miniature Ferris wheel. Costumed adults who ride bikes with banana seats down a 710-foot hill. Not only does Portland have the highest number of bike commuters it the U.S., it has a club of self-described anarchist Zoobombers. Every Sunday night for 10 years, they've picked out a bike from a jumbled pile of customized kiddie bikes near Powell's Books, loaded it onto Portland's light rail system and rode up to the Portland Zoo, where they unloaded, walked up another hill and then zoomed along a designated route through Washington Park. The weirder the costume, the funkier the bike, the better.","Portland, Oregon, has a high quirky quotient .

"Casey Kasem's children are taking their fight against their stepmom to see their ailing father all the way to court. Kasem's daughter Julie Kasem and her husband filed a conservatorship petition in a Los Angeles court Monday, claiming the retired radio host ""has been isolated from his daughters, friends and other family"" by his wife. Kasem, who for decades hosted radio music countdown shows ""American Top 40"" and ""Casey's Top 40,"" is suffering from Parkinson's disease and ""may have early onset Parkinson's dementia,"" according to the court filing. He retired in 2009. Kasem, 81, has the ""ability to shuffle short distances, but is mainly bedridden and requires the assistance of a wheelchair to move any distance,"" the court document said. The petition claims that daughter Julie Kasem and her husband, Dr. Jamil Aboulhosn, have been unable to check on Kasem's health even though her father signed papers in 2007 giving them the power of attorney over his heath care in the event he was unable to make his own health decisions. They ""have been prevented from exercising their duties"" by Jean Kasem, who has been married to the retired radio host for three decades, the filing contends. ""There is no communication between Jean and us and his daughters,"" brother Mouner Kasem told CNN Saturday.  ""We have no knowledge of how he is, what he's doing, if he's better, if he's worse, and we're scared that we'll never see him again."" The petition claims Kasem's wife has refused to provide the children with the name of their father's primary care physician. That doctor would be consulted to determine Kasem's ""ability to act on his own behalf,"" which is the question that would cause the health care power of attorney to take effect, it said. A hearing date is set for November 19. Daughter Kerri Kasem told CNN that her stepmother suddenly barred her sister, her uncle and some of Kasem's friends from seeing him about three months ago. She's perplexed by the decision. ""I don't get it, I don't understand it,"" Kerri Kasem, who co-hosts the radio show ""Sixx Sense"" with Motley Crue's Nikki Sixx, told CNN. ""He has Parkinson's, and all the research we've done indicates socialization would help him."" CNN has reached out to get a statement from Jean Kasem, but has been unsuccessful. Kerri Kasem and other members of the family held a protest at Kasem's Holmby Hills house to raise public attention to their dispute last week. The fight is not about an inheritance, Kerri Kasem said. ""My dad told us a long time ago we were not in the will, and we're OK with that. We've known that for years,"" she said. ""I've never asked him for anything, nor have I asked Jean for anything."" Don Pitts, Kasem's agent of more than 35 years, said he did not want to take sides in the argument, but he did say Casey is still of sound mind. ""He has Parkinson's, has it very bad. It took his speech, and for somebody who made millions of dollars using his voice -- for him to lose that gift, that beautiful instrument -- it must be frustrating. But he's handling it very well,"" Pitts said.  ""His mind is very sharp, his brain works well. You can tell in his eyes he understands everything you're saying. He just has trouble translating it from the brain to his vocal cords."" Besides the famed countdown shows, Casey Kasem was also the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon ""Scooby Doo"" and an announcer for NBC. He was a popular DJ and occasional actor before ""American Top 40"" began in 1970.

"(CNN) -- Back in 2007, when I was participating at a conference on U.S.-China relations, the late U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke repeatedly came back to the importance of not writing the United States off, while warning against getting overexcited about the new emerging China imperium. ""The U.S.,"" he said, ""is not going away any time soon."" Holbrooke's views are evidently shared by the current leadership of China. While many commentators excitedly jabber about the end of the U.S. era and comment on how President Barack Obama -- diminished by his recent electoral drubbing at home -- is regarded as weak and irrelevant in Beijing, the people that matter, namely the Chinese leadership, have proved shrewd enough not to buy into this sort of talk. They see through the transient nature of presidents and their power, and as a strategic political and economic partner, understand that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was right: For them, the United States is the one indispensable nation. The proof of this is the comprehensive agreements issued this year during the APEC meeting in Beijing. Forget all the theater of Russian President Vladimir Putin scowling at Obama minutes before trying to engulf the Chinese President's glamorous wife in a shawl, or the icy image of Chinese President Xi Jinping shaking Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's hand. Because the reality is that -- despite the narrative we might like to impose on all this of a world beating its tracks to Beijing's door -- for policymakers in Beijing, deals like the one just made with the United States on slashing carbon emissions, or the ones on security and economic cooperation, are the one currency truly worth having. But the most misleading aspect of U.S.-China relations is that while in public they are frequently conducted in snarling rhetoric, underneath both sides probably have more mutual links and increasing common ground than ever before. And while separating the sound and fury from the truth is tough, on the fight against terrorism, the need to find sustainable economic growth, preserving a benign, stable international environment, and increasing predictability in the global financial governance system, China and the United States often pretend they are much further apart than they actually are. Their main business now is tactical -- trying to search out spaces for strategic advantage. With its proposed Asian Free Trade Zone, along with building diverse energy supply links through Russia and central Asia, China is engaged in staking out discrete spaces where it can move without being hedged in. It knows that long arguments with neighbors like Japan peg it down and reduce its space to act. Having as many friends as possible is Xi's diplomatic priority, after years of brittle tensions with so many countries around China's land and maritime borders. There is a simple reason for this. China is entering a period of tough economic transition. The Third and Fourth Plenum meetings of the Chinese Communist Party made this clear. Many things need to be done, from raising consumption to addressing water supply issues and the dangerous state of the air quality in the country. Too many rows with the world outside distract from the real business of dealing with these internal matters. And in all these areas, whatever the distrust and misunderstandings held by the world's second biggest economy toward the largest, the gains from continuing to be constructive and mostly friendly, at least on the surface, far outweigh the benefits of acting tough. Of course, all this might change one day, when China really feels it has to demand more international strategic space and sees the United States as an impediment to that. But APEC this year has underscored that that day is a long time in the future.","Talk of the end of a U.S. era premature, says Kerry Brown .

"The first officer aboard the missing Malaysia Airlines flight once invited two teenagers he just met into the cockpit of his plane during another  international flight, one of the women told ""Piers Morgan Live."" Jonti Roos, who first told her story to the Australian Channel 9 program ""A Current Affair,"" said she is Facebook friends with Fariq Ab Hamid, the first officer on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Roos told CNN on Wednesday that she and a friend were waiting for a flight in 2011 when Hamid and another pilot asked them if they wanted to sit in the cockpit during the flight. Roos and her friend agreed and went to their assigned seats when they boarded. Later they were escorted to the cockpit, she said, and they were there for the rest of the flight. Such a practice would be illegal on U.S. carriers, but not necessarily so on international ones, CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest said. Access to the cockpit is up to the discretion of the captain. Roos provided pictures she said was from the flight she described. In a statement, Malaysia Airlines said it was ""shocked by these allegations."" ""We have not been able to confirm the validity of the pictures and videos of the alleged incident,"" it said. ""As you are aware, we are in the midst of a crisis, and we do not want our attention to be diverted."" How you can help find the plane . ""A Current Affair"" said Roos e-mailed its producers about the incident after she was on Facebook and recognized Hamid, 27, as one of the two pilots during a December 2011 flight from Phuket, Thailand, to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The teens, who lived in South Africa at the time, were returning from a vacation, she said. Hamid, who joined Malaysia Airlines in 2007, had compiled 2,763 flying hours by last Saturday, when the Boeing 777-200ER carrying 239 people went off radar screens. ""Yes, they were posing for pictures. I'd just like to make it very clear I don't think they were distracted at all by posing for pictures. We did take pictures of them, but I don't think it was a distraction,"" Roos said by Skype from her current home in Melbourne, Australia. Michael Goldfarb, a former U.S. Federal Aviation Administration chief of staff, said that the long routes in international flying can be boring and some pilots will watch movies on personal computers while the plane is in the cruise portion of the flight. But inviting outsiders in the cockpit would be a no-no. ""It just violates every code of conduct. I don't believe Malaysia Air (would approve of such conduct) ... they certainly would be shocked at that,"" he said. After the flight, Roos said, Hamid sent her a Facebook message, wishing her a safe flight home. Roos said she was shocked when she learned that Hamid was at the controls of the missing plane. ""I couldn't believe it,"" she told ""A Current Affair."" ""When I saw all his friends and his family posting on his wall, obviously, my heart really broke for them and my heart broke for all the families of the passengers. It's a really sad story."" Asked why she had contacted the television program, Roos said, ""It seems like everybody's completely in the dark and nobody has any information, so I thought the tiny bit that I have I just want to share and maybe it can help with something."" She brushed off suggestions that she was lying about the cockpit adventure and told Morgan the proof was in the pictures. ""I have no reason to make something like this up. It's not malicious at all,,"" she said. ""I wouldn't want to make something up that would potentially hurt people."" Timeline of the flight .

"(CNN) -- CBS News correspondent Lara Logan, who suffered an especially brutal sexual assault in Egypt's Tahrir Square while covering the country's revolution, said Sunday she feared a torturous death at the hands of the mob. ""I thought not only am I going to die here, but it's going to be just a torturous death that's going to go on forever and ever and ever,"" she said in a ""60 Minutes"" interview, her first on camera since the assault. Logan was covering the celebration that erupted in Tahrir Square following the resignation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on February 11. She reported for about an hour without any trouble. The atmosphere in the square was festive, like a party, she said, until all of a sudden, it wasn't. An Arabic-speaking member of Logan's crew abruptly said she needed to leave. ""I was told later that they were saying, 'Let's take her pants off,'"" said Logan, 40, about men in the crowd around her. Connie Chung shows her support for Logan . ""Before I even know what's happening, I feel hands grabbing my breasts, grabbing my crotch, grabbing me from behind,"" she said. ""It's not just one person ... it's one person and another person and another person."" At first, Logan said she tried to yell, but that her screams ""turned them into a frenzy."" ""I didn't even know that they were beating me with flagpoles and sticks and things because I couldn't even feel that ... the sexual assault was all I could feel -- was their hands raping me over and over and over again."" Logan felt men pull her hair, trying to rip away her scalp and tear at her limbs, her muscles. Her clothes were shredded. When she lost contact with the last remaining member of her crew, Logan -- speaking through tears -- said she had no doubt at that moment she was going to die. But Logan, who has two young children, said she never stopped struggling. ""It's about staying alive now. I have to just surrender to the sexual assault. What more can they do now?"" she asked. ""The only thing to fight for, left to fight for, was my life."" Egyptian film shines light on sexual harassment . The brutal attack went on for some 25 minutes, CBS reported. At some point, she was dragged by the mob until it was stopped by a fence, near to where a group of Egyptian women was sitting. She fell onto the lap of one woman, who put her arms around her, protecting her, Logan recalled. Other women closed rank. Finally, some Egyptian soldiers fought their way through the crowd with batons, Logan said. One threw her over his back and took her to a tank. She was reunited with her crew and soldiers drove them back to their hotel, CBS said. Logan later flew to the United States, where she went straight to a hospital. She is healing and said she feels strong. Logan, who told The New York Times last week that she did not plan to give any other interviews after the ""60 Minutes"" segment was broadcast, said she is proud of having spoken out about her experience and breaking the silence around journalists and sexual violence. A survey in 2008 by the Egyptian Center for Women's Rights claimed that 98% of foreign women and 83% of Egyptian women in the country had been sexually harassed. ""Women never complain about incidents of sexual violence because you don't want someone to say 'Well, women shouldn't be out there.' But I think there are a lot of women who experience these kind of things as journalists and they don't want it to stop them from doing their job because they do it for the same reasons as me,"" said Logan. ""They do it because they believe in being journalists.""","Lara Logan suffered a brutal sexual assault in Egypt's Tahrir Square .

"The pathologist hired by Michael Brown's family to conduct an autopsy on the Ferguson, Missouri, teenager will testify Thursday before the grand jury that is deciding whether to indict a police officer in Brown's killing, according to family attorney Anthony Gray. Dr. Michael Baden, the former medical examiner for the city of New York, conducted a second autopsy on the 18-year-old's body after a local medical examiner performed one. Though the grand jury has until January to make a decision, the prosecutor's office has said that an announcement on whether it will indict Ferguson officer Darren Wilson could come as early as mid-November. Residents nervous ahead of announcement . There's intense nervousness in the St. Louis suburb as many residents fear that a repeat of the chaos and violence, and clashes between protesters and police, could happen again when the grand jury's decision is announced. In the days after Brown's killing, protesters marched in the streets, enraged because they felt the fatal shooting was the result of an excessive use of force by police. Witnesses to the shooting say that Brown, an unarmed African-American, had his hands in the air as if he was surrendering when he was shot by Wilson, a white officer. Authorities have said that Brown tussled with Wilson and tried to take the officer's weapon. There was also anger when autopsy results from a first procedure were not released, many felt, in a timely fashion. Brown was shot at least six times, independent autopsy shows . Legal opinions differ . CNN's legal experts are offering differing opinions about allowing an expert hired by a party in a case to address a grand jury. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said it's not an unusual move. ""Grand juries often hear a variety of evidence from many different sources,"" he said. ""Calling this expert is consistent with the prosecutor's promise to present all the available evidence to the grand jury."" CNN legal expert and longtime New York attorney Paul Callan, who has presented cases to hundreds of grand juries, said it is highly unusual. ""When a prosecutor says he's going to present all evidence available, the implication is that he or she is presenting all sorts of objective evidence of non-interested bystanders,"" Callan said. The Brown family pathologist ""is someone hired by the family and presumably to support a civil lawsuit for money damages later,"" Callan said. It's not illegal to call someone hired by an interested party, he added, but the police officer's side may perceive it as unfair. ""What would stop the cop's attorney from asking, 'Why can't we do our own autopsy now?'"" Baden is a high-profile pathologist, having testified in the murder trials of O.J. Simpson, Phil Spector and Drew Peterson. He was also chairman of the committee of pathologists that investigated the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Opinion: What Michael Brown's autopsy tells us . The grand jury process . Grand jurors' work is done in secret. Only a prosecutor and the jurors are present; the defense attorney is not privy to the proceedings. The jurors can ask a prosecutor to see anything -- including, for example, an autopsy conducted by an outside expert, Callan said. But -- if it's legal -- it's at the prosecutor's discretion whether to give it to them, the attorney explained. Everything between the prosecutor and jurors is on the record which is made available later to the public. ""In a case like this which is so controversial, (the prosecutor) knows everything is going to be scrutinized,"" Callan said, adding that he suspects the prosecutor is giving a ""complete presentation"" of all material to the jury and informing jurors plainly of the law. Both Callan and Joey Jackson, a criminal defense attorney and CNN legal analyst, said it's crucial to balance providing the jury with too much or too little information. A prosecutor has to ""be careful"" Jackson said on CNN Wednesday. A grand jury should hear information that is explanatory rather than persuasive, he stressed.

Jeff Flake and Tom Udall fly back from Cuba to the United States on Wednesday, they will carry the regret of not being able to take with them Alan Gross, a U.S. government subcontractor serving a 15-year prison sentence on the island. ""Alan wants to come home,"" Flake, an Arizona Republican, said at a news conference after a two-hour meeting with the imprisoned American on Tuesday. The two senators, who are critics of the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba, said they had come to Cuba to again push for Gross' release. They said his imprisonment is an impediment to improved U.S.-Cuba relations. ""Other people have tried to come and meet with him and not been able to,"" said Udall, a New Mexico Democrat. ""That's an optimistic thing."" Last week, CNN was the first to report that Gross was refusing to meet with U.S. diplomats in Havana, in protest over the slow progress to free him. Detained American Alan Gross 'withdrawn' Gross' attorney Scott Gilbert said his client told him he would be happy to see U.S. officials ""at the airport, when he leaves Cuba, assuming he's alive."" Flake and Udall said they also met Tuesday with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla. The Cuban government has called for a prisoner swap: Gross for three imprisoned Cuban intelligence agents serving lengthy federal prison sentences in the United States. But the U.S. State Department has nixed the idea of a swap, saying Gross was an aid worker merely trying to help Cuba's small Jewish community get online despite Cuban government restrictions on Internet access. Frustrated by the diplomatic impasse, Gross has threatened to kill himself if he isn't freed soon. ""I do feel we are closer,"" Flake said. ""One, because of what Alan Gross has said himself. This is going to end one way or another. We have gone on five years and any benefit the Cuban government may have seen has to have evaporated."" Gross was arrested in 2009 for smuggling in banned communications equipment to Cuba. He was convicted of violating the island's sovereignty and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Cuban authorities say he was part of a larger program by the U.S. Agency for International Development to undermine the island's single-party communist form of government. In 2014, USAID had to defend programs to create a text messaging ""Cuban Twitter"" program to stir dissent and another program to recruit future leaders on the island. On Monday, The Associated Press reported that the agency would soon cease all covert programs in Cuba. ""There's been a statement that there wont be covert programs run out of AID anymore and that's a good thing,"" Flake said. ""Its not just a source of tension between the countries, it puts Americans in danger and really cheapens AID's mission around the world."" More on detained Americans .","Sens.

"A man suspected in a series of buttock slashings in Fairfax, Virginia, has been captured in Peru, authorities said. Johnny D. Guillen, known as the ""Corta Nalgas"" -- or ""butt cutter"" -- was captured Friday in Lima, according to Jair Quedas, system operator for Interpol Peru. Authorities in the United States were looking for Guillen for allegedly cutting the buttocks of 13 young women, according to America Noticias, Peruvian local television. Fairfax County Police in Virginia posted on its website that the man -- whom it identifies as Johnny D. Guillen Pimentel -- is suspected in a retail store assault that took place last year. County police set up a task force to try to find a serial assailant responsible for several attacks that took place between February 2011 and July 2011. ""In each case, the suspect distracts his victim before cutting them. The victims have all been teenaged women or in their early 20s,"" Fairfax County Police said in a statement last year. In one incident, officers responded to a report of a woman who suffered a 1 1/2 inch wound to her buttocks at a Forever 21 store on July 25. ""The 18-year-old victim was shopping when she noticed clothes that had fallen off of a rack behind her and saw a man bending down to pick them up,"" police said. ""She abruptly felt a sharp pain and considered that one of the hangers had struck her. A short time later, she discovered her denim shorts had been slashed; her buttocks had been cut and were bleeding."" In another case, police said, a 21-year-old woman was shopping at a T.J. Maxx store at Fairfax Towne Center on June 8 when she felt a pinch on her buttocks. Similar to other reports, ""the victim turned around, saw a man picking up pieces of clothing and thought she may have been cut by one of the hangers,"" police said. ""When the woman returned home, she discovered cuts in her clothing.""","Police say the victims are females in their teens or early 20s .

"Analysts are right to assess the level of national preparedness to climate change -- but well-intentioned efforts to rank countries can inadvertently sow hopelessness among those considered to be ill-prepared. A recent University of Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index (ND-GAI) ranks Norway, New Zealand, Sweden, Finland and Denmark as the world's best prepared nations. At the bottom of the adaptation index lie Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Central African Republic, Eritrea, Burundi and lastly Chad. The report says that the highest ranked countries ""face moderate exposure to climate change, but they have good capacities to deal with the potential climate risks, including high access to amenities such as electricity, sanitation and clean drinking water. In general, they are also less dependent on natural capital, are better prepared for natural disasters and practice good governance."" Such preparedness assessments focus on existing conditions and capabilities and fail to account for emerging technological opportunities that might be easily adapted by those with the least access to conventional infrastructure and capabilities. This narrative overlooks the fact these same countries have also developed a wide range of local capabilities that enable them to adapt to major natural disasters as illustrated by the case of the Sahel region. As argued by Simon Batterbury (University of Melbourne, Australia) and Michael Mortimore (Drylands Research, UK), Sahelian adaptation to drought is ""a combination of skill and technique, both learned and invented, and has been combined with deliberate efforts by households and communities to reduce their vulnerability."" The authors conclude that the lessons of Sahelian adaptation offer strong indications of the ability of communities to adapt to the challenges of future climate variability and uncertainty. Their adaptation ""should be facilitated rather than driven from the outside,"" they conclude. The challenge is to strengthen local capabilities through endogenous technological innovation in fields such as energy, agriculture, health and environmental management. But doing so will require acknowledging the pro-active, creative and innovative capabilities of local communities. Harnessing technology . The second important element of innovation is the capacity of the less resource-endowed communities to harness emerging technologies and put them to creative uses. In the 1970s, Africa was written off as a region for technological innovation and was defined as destination for low and simple devices dubbed ""appropriate technology."" The celebrated story of the widespread usage of mobile phone has rebranded the continent as a place where emerging technologies can find novel and unanticipated uses. The invention of mobile money transfer in Kenya is a good example of an African response to poor banking infrastructure. The global mobile money market is currently valued at $15 billion and is projected to $278.9 billion by 2018, growing at an estimated annual rate of 82.4%. The importance of this African creation lies in its global impact. The carbon footprint of mobile phones relative to landlines has yet to be calculated. When this is done it will add a new dimension to Africa's contributions to the use of climate-smart technologies. Similar examples of technological leapfrogging are evident is countries such as DRC which is listed as among the least capable of adapting to climate change. The country, which is about the size of Western Europe, had the same length of paved road network as Rwanda, which is about 80 times smaller. The rapid expansion of road networks and economic growth in DRC resulted in urban traffic chaos. The country, through the work of women engineers, has responded by leapfrogging to the use of robot technology to control traffic in Kinshasa. Alternative energy resources . There are other areas of direct relevance to climate change that African economies could provide leadership. The first is renewable energy. Advances in solar and wind energy technology (and the associated smart power management systems) are making renewable energy competitive with fossil fuels. Their widespread adoption is likely to favor poor nations in the tropics that are not committed to traditional energy infrastructure. Access to information on emerging technologies often limits Africa's leapfrogging capabilities. This is being remedied by the expansion of technical education and internet connectivity. Future efforts to adapt to climate change will be guided by emerging African strategies that seek to focus on leveraging technological innovation for sustainable development. Comparing the preparedness of countries to climate change helps to focus attention on the need for concerted national adaptation strategies. But failing to account for the adaptive potential of all nations can create despair among the poor and complacency among the rich. It is possible that some of the ideas that might help the global community to adapt to climate change might come from the poor. Read this: Why small nations must unite for climate revolution .

"(CNN) -- Nine people were missing and presumed dead and four were hospitalized Wednesday after a helicopter carrying firefighters crashed the night before in northern California, aviation spokesmen said. The Sikorsky S-61 helicopter entered a remote area to pick up firefighters battling wildfires, said Ian Gregor of the Federal Aviation Administration. The crash happened about 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, 35 miles northwest of Redding in the Trinity Alps Wilderness area of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Two crew members and 11 firefighters were aboard, Gregor said. Three of the injured were contract firefighters, and the fourth was the pilot, said Sharon Heywood, the forest's supervisor. All of the injured initially were taken to Mercy Hospital near Davis, California. A firefighter in critical condition and two people in serious condition -- a firefighter and the pilot -- were transferred to the University of California Davis Medical Center, Heywood said. The third firefighter remained at Mercy in serious condition Wednesday, she said. Heywood said the crash site was difficult to access because of its terrain. U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Daria Day said the helicopter, assigned to a group of four fires burning in the forest, went down near the north end of the so-called Buckhorn fire. She said she didn't know if the helicopter was landing or taking off. The helicopter was operated by Carson Helicopters, which has offices in Grants Pass, Oregon, and Perkasie, Pennsylvania, according to Sacramento, California, TV station KCRA. ""We don't know what occurred,"" Carson Helicopters' Bob Madden told KCRA. ""We haven't examined the aircraft yet. We've never had a copter go down due to firefighting efforts."" The crash was being investigated by the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board, Gregor said. The Buckhorn fire -- part of the Iron Complex fires in the forest -- has burned more than 18,500 acres since it started June 21, the Forest Service said. It was 25 percent contained Wednesday, according to the service. The four Iron Complex fires have burned more than 84,000 acres since they started on or about June 21, the service said.","Helicopter carrying 11 firefighters, two crewmen crashes in California, officials say .

"OK, we know. If you've traveled to, or through, Atlanta, you probably have one of two impressions. 1. Wow, that's a big, crazy airport. 2. Wow, that traffic really sucked. Maybe you got to spend a little time downtown for a convention or ballgame. And, sure, there were the highlights like the Georgia Aquarium, the College Football Hall of Fame and the World of Coca-Cola. But after that, unless you knew exactly where to look, you probably saw a lot of concrete, a lot of places that closed at 6 p.m., and culinary and entertainment options just like the other roughly 430 Hooters or 175 Hard Rock Cafes. Here's the good news: You've been to Atlanta. But you haven't really been to Atlanta. Get away from that street named Peachtree (or one of the dozens of other streets we named Peachtree for your convenience), and there's a city with a lot more to offer. The capital of the New South has been called a small town trapped in a big city. In fact, it's a lot of small towns, coexisting, for the most part, inside and alongside the borders of that big city. And like the long list of Southern storytellers who have called Atlanta home, if you spend enough time with it, it will share its secrets with you. Good eats . As a food-lover friend recently said, in Atlanta, you can go to dinner and a show, or you can just go to dinner. Gourmands the land over have noticed that the ATL (please, never call it ""Hotlanta"") is quietly becoming a destination for high-quality dining, with everything from schmancy white-tablecloth affairs to traditional soul-food and meat-and-three spots drawing crowds. Gunshow, the latest by ""Top Chef"" alum and Atlanta native Kevin Gillespie, was recently named one of Esquire's best new restaurants and marries Brazilian churrascari and Chinese dim sum-style dining with Gillespie's love of all things meat. Celebrity chef Richard Blais has FLIP Burger and The Spence. Empire State South is one of Hugh Acheson's four restaurants in Georgia; it serves three meals a day that focus heavily on local ingredients. Perhaps tickling the most taste buds lately is chef Ford Fry, whose seven spots range from seafood (The Optimist) to Italian-inspired (No. 246) as well as stretching from Atlanta's re-emerging Westside to its commuter-heavy northern suburbs. And all of that's not even to mention Buford Highway's ridiculously rich array of traditional Asian cuisine; tradition-rich Mary Mac's Tea Room; no-frills Ann's Snack Bar, home of the massive Ghetto Burger; and Pallookaville Fine Foods, the carny sideshow-themed bastion of guilty pleasures evolved from a corn dog cart by Jim Stacy, host of the Cooking Channel's ""Offbeat Eats."" Songs of the South . It's been decades since the Allman Bros. made the short drive up from Macon to conquer Atlanta with tunes like ""Melissa"" and ""Hot'lanta."" (Again ... please don't call it that.) Now, it's all about the Dirty South. The New York Times has called Atlanta ""hip-hop's center of gravity,"" and aside from New York and Los Angeles, it's hard to argue for another city being as influential in the form's evolution. A recent three-day stand by native sons Outkast in Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park turned into a joyous homecoming weekend of sorts, bringing together everyone from hip young urbanites to suburban soccer moms to shake it like a Polaroid picture to a group that's helped define hip-hop since emerging from Atlanta's neighbor East Point in 1992. Cee Lo Green, Lil Jon, T.I., Ludacris and Usher are just a few of the other artists who call Atlanta home, where a new generation of MCs and DJs are bubbling up at venues like Apache Cafe, T.I.'s Club Crucial and MJQ Concourse. The presence of Usher, and his Vanity record label, has even been responsible for drawing Justin Bieber to the city. But don't hold that against us. If hip-hop isn't your thing, Atlanta has a thriving underground rock scene, spawning such current acts as sludge rockers Mastodon, power-pop stars-in-waiting The Biters and indie darlings Deerhunter. And Eddie's Attic is one of the most highly regarded acoustic music venues in the United States. Performers from across the country are on the months-long waiting list for the club's highly regarded open-mic showcase, which has helped launch artists like John Mayer, Sugarland, the Indigo Girls and Shawn Mullins. A city of small towns . Unlike a lot of cities, Atlanta doesn't have a central entertainment and shopping district. You know ... unless you love the Hard Rock and Hooters. If you're looking for a taste of Atlanta only downtown, you'll be disappointed. Instead, hit neighborhoods like Little Five Points, packed with record stores, live music and theater venues, restaurants, vintage clothing shops and the like (Not to mention a burger joint with a giant psychedelic skull for an entrance). Or similarly funky East Atlanta Village, where The Earl serves indie rock and brunch with equal skill and residents are so cool, they have their own Web radio station. For a slightly quieter good time, hit the square in downtown Decatur, which bumps up to Atlanta's eastern city limit and, in addition to being home to the aforementioned Eddie's Attic, features enough great restaurants that foodies have visited just to nosh at the spots packed within about a half-mile of each other. Cabbagetown. Virginia-Highland. Buckhead. Sweet Auburn. Castleberry Hill. West End. If you want to enjoy the real Atlanta, skip Hooters, catch a cab and enjoy some of what the city really has to offer. The story of civil rights . The South teems with civil rights history, and different cities often focus on their slivers of the story. Atlanta has made a play to introduce the broad history to new generations by connecting the movement of the 1960s to the human rights issues of today. The National Center for Civil and Human Rights opened this year, offering comprehensive and sometimes intense views of the movement's darkest moments and greatest achievements. Another side of the museum presents an evolving look at modern human rights issues around the world. Just a few miles down the road, visitors can examine the lives of the movement's greatest leader, Martin Luther King Jr. Tours of King's birth home on Auburn Avenue are free, and tickets are often snapped up early in the day. Even visitors who don't score a trip through the stately yellow home can spend hours wandering the Martin Luther King Jr. Historic Site run by the National Park Service, peeking into historic Ebenezer Baptist Church or visiting the King Center -- the resting place of King and his wife, Coretta Scott King. Howard Finster's 'Paradise': The South's most inspired garden . Beyond the big attractions . When in Atlanta, you're basically obligated to cross the sugar-sticky floors of the World of Coca-Cola tasting room, to gawk at Margaret Mitchell's ""Gone with the Wind""-era parlor and drop in on the latest big-name exhibition at the High Museum of Art. But you'll be missing out if you stop at the typical tourist draws. To get a deeper view of the city's history and personality, check out some of the smaller attractions not far from downtown. There's the Center for Puppetry Arts, where you can catch a puppet show geared toward kids or adults, or just get a close-up look at beloved puppets from Jim Henson Family Collection. Yes, your favorites are there, from the Swedish Chef to the Fraggles to Miss Piggy herself. Old and young can enjoy storytime at the Wren's Nest, the meticulously restored West End home of famed Atlanta writer Joel Chandler Harris, who wrote the beloved and controversial Uncle Remus tales. And just west of downtown, the Spelman College Museum of Fine Art offers fantastically curated exhibitions that focus on art by and about women of the African diaspora. For a glimpse of these and other out-of-the-way spots, as showcased by locals, take a look for the #WeLoveATL hashtag, started by a couple of photographers who didn't think the city was showing out on social media like it should, on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. Ditch the car -- no, really . What if you could visit Atlanta and somehow excuse yourself from all the tired jokes about terrible traffic? (Punchline: Your time is worthless! HA! Ha?) Believe it; it can be done. There are more attractions and restaurants popping up along the city's MARTA train lines. A single ride costs $2.50, far less than a cab or rental car. A new streetcar will soon be running in a 2.7-mile east-west loop from the hotel-heavy downtown. It'll take visitors past a gaggle of quirky pop-up shops to the burgeoning bar scene along Edgewood Avenue and near the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site. Visitors can also hit the Atlanta BeltLine Eastside Trail, a car-free stretch where residents run, ride, scoot and stroll, sometimes stopping for a drink at a restaurant along the way or dropping by Piedmont Park, the city's busy central greenspace. More Beltline trails are in the works, which will only make it easier to navigate between neighborhoods with just a pair of comfortable shoes.

"The reputations of one of the Army's finest generals and of a once-admired institution may get tarnished, but nothing should now get in the way of urgent investigations, firings and immediate fixes in health care for veterans. And for good measure, maybe heads should roll at the White House, too, because what we have been told so far about a burgeoning scandal over veterans' care doesn't add up. The story line out of the administration is that the head of Veterans Affairs, retired Gen. Eric Shinseki, and President Obama are both ""mad as hell"" about alleged misdeeds and have sprung into action to put things aright. We are led to believe that alarm bells went off in both organizations as soon as allegations surfaced. One would so like to believe that were the case. Shinseki has a sterling record as a soldier. He was twice wounded in Vietnam -- the second time grievously, losing most of one foot. A lesser man would have been forced out of the service but through sheer courage (he used to run punishing laps around a track to show he was still able), he convinced the Army to let him stay and he rose to four stars.  More recently, Shinseki was the man who had the guts to tell the truth before we went into Iraq -- insisting he needed a much bigger force -- and was essentially cashiered. I have long been an unabashed admirer. Obama has also taken up the cause of veterans since he first ran for the U.S. Senate.  So has the first lady.  And under this president, much good has been accomplished for veterans in terms of health care, reducing homelessness, jobs, and importantly, a nation's respect. But as admirable as Shinseki's and Obama's records have been on behalf of veterans, the story line the administration has been peddling about the VA's care of veterans simply doesn't fit the facts. The underlying problem at the heart of this scandal -- excessive, long waits for medical care for veterans coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan -- has persisted for years. Running for the White House, candidate Obama promised action. Soon after he took over the VA, Shinseki did take action, ordering that henceforth veterans would not have to wait more than 14 days for a medical appointment. But the bureaucracy at the VA, second only to the Pentagon in size, is notoriously sluggish.  In 2010 -- four years ago! -- the deputy undersecretary of the VA wrote a nine-page memo saying that in order to cover up their continued delays, various parts of the VA system were engaged in ""gaming strategies"" -- in effect, lying. The General Accounting Office and VA inspector generals wrote reports saying the practice was widespread. One would have thought that would have set off alarm bells at both the VA and the White House. Where was the anger then? There were some internal investigations, but they never went anywhere and there was little apparent sense of urgency. Six months ago, CNN turned loose its own investigative reporters and aired stories about excessive waits in several facilities across the country.  Again, the VA and the White House had little to say. Then a month ago, CNN (along with the Arizona Republic) broke the story from the Phoenix VA that managers there have allegedly been cooking their books to provide false assurances. Veterans awaiting care were dying. The administration seemed to brush the story aside and Shinseki refused repeated requests from CNN for an interview. Recent days have been a political nightmare for the VA. Hauled before Congress to testify, Shinseki testified that evidence suggested only ""isolated incidents"" in the system. That same day CNN was reporting that there were allegations of misdeeds in at least six centers across the country. The next day the VA itself said there were 10 centers under investigation. By this week, the official number had mushroomed to 26. And weeks after the fact, the VA has rescinded a bonus it gave earlier this year to the boss of that Phoenix operation. In the weeks ahead, the administration now says, investigators will come up with reports and maybe some folks will be forced out. We will see. In the meantime, veterans are still waiting to hear of decisive action to end their long delays in care. When troubles arise in which Americans are needlessly dying, citizens like to think of the president as the fireman-in-chief. He is there in the White House, his team ever vigilant, and at the first sign of danger, he leads his team into action. At his side is the Cabinet officer with responsibility. Sadly, that is not what happened here. For most Americans, the story of VA officials allegedly falsifying records of veterans' care is disgusting. Those old enough to remember will be reminded how the government falsified counts of body bags in Vietnam.  But the real issue is whether as a country, we are keeping faith with our veterans -- whether, as Abraham Lincoln urged in his second inaugural, we are binding the wounds of those who fought. Surely, we owe them prompt and professional care -- no more excuses, no more delays, no more b.s.","David Gergen: President Obama and Eric Shinseki have done much for veterans .

"Aaron Swartz helped create the Internet. Maybe not the Internet foundations of ARPANET and TCP/IP and Mosaic, the codes and packets and standards on which the whole thing is based. But he was a factor in fashioning some of the Web's upper floors. With his contributions to RSS coding and the Web application framework, Swartz made some of today's more expansive Internet possible. But what Swartz also helped create was a philosophy of the Internet, one that remains the subject of great controversy almost 20 years into its life: the libertarian idea that information wants to be free. ""Aaron was a genius,"" said Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist and a senior policy analyst at the ACLU. ""He was a technologist who was committed to open access to information, and committed to bringing about the changes he believed in."" ""Aaron was an embodiment of the Web, and a contributor to many of the aspects that made it great,"" said Matt Mullenweg, who founded the blogging platform WordPress, in a statement. ""When I was young and getting into technology Aaron was even younger and literally setting the standards for the Web with contributions to RSS 1.0 and Creative Commons. He inspired a generation to share online, to move to (San Francisco), to not be afraid to start things, and to break down barriers."" Swartz died Friday of an apparent suicide in his apartment in Brooklyn, New York. He was 26. Although Swartz's life was not without controversy -- he faced federal charges that he illegally downloaded millions of scholarly papers from MIT -- his death has been met with an outpouring of tributes and grief. A Tumblr page was set up for people to express their thoughts and condolences. Friends and commenters there described him as ""inspiring,"" ""enthusiastic,"" ""a hero,"" ""shy,"" ""a great technologist"" -- a bright, inquisitive, creative, challenging personality who deeply affected those he touched. Opinion: Why the Net grieves Aaron Swartz . ""Such a brilliant, disciplined, well-spoken guy with a great sense of humor, who probably knew as much about 'Star Wars' mythology and trivia as he did about programming computers,"" wrote a member of Chicago Force, a ""Star Wars"" fan club, noting the shock of club members in 1999 when they met with the budding Web developer and discovered he was just 12 years old. ""Let his life be an inspiration to us all to keep fighting, to keep building a better world, where free expression and open standards become the norm for everyone,"" added Jan Zuppinger, who described himself as an ""Internet Freedom Activist."" ""World wanderers, we have lost a wise elder. Hackers for right, we are one down,"" said World Wide Web creator Tim Berners-Lee in a tweet. 'I want something new, something worthwhile, something better' Swartz was apparently committed to such activism from an early age.  He was born in Chicago, the son of a software company founder, and showed both intellect and restlessness at an early age. ""My name is Aaron Swartz,"" he wrote on a blog when he was a teenager, according to an entry on the Tumblr. (The actual blog post appears to be unavailable.)  ""I'm a 9th grader at the North Shore Country Day School. In the summer of 2000, I finally realized that school wasn't working. I decided to do something about it. ... I'm tired of outdated teaching practices where the students don't learn anything. I'm tired of constantly being prepared for more preparation. I want something new, something worthwhile, something better."" He would have been 13 at the time. Swartz never really gravitated to old-fashioned schooling; after his blog note, he mainly studied at home. He enrolled at Stanford in 2004 but only stayed a year, saying he didn't find ""a very intellectual atmosphere"" on the campus at the edge of Silicon Valley.  He later became a fellow at Harvard University's Ethics Center Lab on Institutional Corruption. Swartz was a prodigy. By the time he was 14, he had co-written the specification for RSS -- originally Rich Site Summary, now Really Simple Syndication -- a Web-publishing technology for delivering syndicated content from frequently updated sites, such as blogs or news websites. RSS allows Web consumers to receive the latest stories on a feed without having to constantly revisit their favorite pages. If you subscribe to a podcast -- or receive automatic updates from CNN.com -- you have Swartz to thank. After leaving Stanford he created Infogami, which was later merged with Reddit, the freewheeling social-news site where users vote their favorite stories onto the main page. Reddit, which was purchased by Conde Nast in 2006, has come under fire for its anything-goes ethos. One popular Reddit moderator, who went by the name Violentacrez, was known for starting Reddit pages devoted to underage girls and violent fantasies. When his identity became known via a Gawker article, he was fired from his job. Swartz was long gone from Reddit by then -- he was let go just after the Conde Nast purchase -- but believed in the ethos of the site and the open Internet in general. ""(He) engineered his own dismissal and got cashed out, and then became a full-time, uncompromising, reckless and delightful s***-disturber,"" wrote BoingBoing's Cory Doctorow, a friend of Swartz's, in a tribute. One of Swartz's desires was to make public information truly public -- that is, free and easily available. There's a government-run system, PACER, that allows the public to access court records online. However, PACER charged a fee for accessing this public-domain information. As Doctorow observed, Swartz ""singlehandedly liberated 20% of U.S. law"" by moving the information onto a public site, spending ""a small fortune"" of his own money doing so. Later, Swartz founded Demand Progress, a group devoted to Internet activism. For all his success with programming, it's in this arena that he had the most impact, said Soghoian. Demand Progress was instrumental in fighting the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect IP Act, two bills that would have expanded government oversight in fighting Internet piracy and copyright violations at the possible expense of the free flow of information. ""He really, really believed that public information should be free and accessible to everyone,"" said Soghoian. Suicide sparks talk about depression . 'This was not serious computer hacking' By the time SOPA and PIPA were shot down last year, Swartz had become entangled in another legal thicket surrounding free access to online data. According to federal prosecutors, Swartz used MIT's computer networks to download more than 4 million articles from JSTOR, a digital library of academic journals, in 2010 and 2011. He was charged with wire fraud, computer fraud and other crimes, even though JSTOR declined to prosecute and urged the government to drop the case. ""What Aaron was accused of by the government (was) essentially a serious form of computer hacking,"" said Soghoian. If found guilty, Swartz could have been sentenced to up to 35 years in jail and a $1 million fine. Soghoian was one of many observers surprised at the severity of the charges. ""These are the kinds of things you'd assume the government would use in a serious hacking case -- identity theft, millions of credit card numbers stolen, hacking into protected government databases or corporate networks,"" he said. ""Aaron was accused of downloading too many articles from a website that anyone connected to the MIT network could log into. ""This was not serious computer hacking and the government didn't appear to differentiate between those kinds of activities."" Prosecutors saw it differently. When Swartz was indicted in July 2011, U.S. Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz said, ""Stealing is stealing whether you use a computer command or a crowbar, and whether you take documents, data or dollars. It is equally harmful to the victim whether you sell what you have stolen or give it away."" In the wake of Swartz's death, critics have been quick to cast blame. Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig, an outspoken writer on Internet issues, titled a blog post ""Prosecutor as bully."" ""From the beginning the government worked as hard as it could to characterize what Aaron did in the most extreme and absurd way,"" he wrote. ""Somehow, we need to get beyond the 'I'm right so I'm right to nuke you' ethics that dominates our time. That begins with one word: Shame."" Swartz's family was equally pointed. ""Aaron's death is not simply a personal tragedy. It is the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach. Decisions made by officials in the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney's office and at MIT contributed to his death,"" they said in a statement. Christina DiIorio-Sterling, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice, declined to comment to CNN on Swartz's case, citing respect for his family. Soghoian, the ACLU's analyst, said he sees Swartz's death as a great loss. Swartz could have made a fortune as a start-up wizard or venture capitalist but instead he plowed what money he made into his activism, he said. ""Aaron is seen as a hero. He spent a lot of time working to make the Internet a more open place,"" Soghoian said. ""We lost a really important person who changed the Internet in a positive way, and we all lose out by his departure.""","Aaron Swartz, young Internet innovator, committed suicide Friday .

"A bio-drone that dissolves after use leaving no trace it ever existed may sound like the stuff of a James Bond film, but NASA and a team of researchers are actually building one. Made from a substance that combines mushroom fibers and cloned paper wasp spit, the drone might resemble a propeller-powered egg carton, but its designers say it has the ability to fly into environmentally sensitive areas and leave almost no trace. Lynn Rothschild, the NASA developer guiding students from Stanford-Brown-Spelman working on the project, says the drone could be made to disappear simply by ditching it into a stream or puddle. She said her interest in unmanned aerial vehicles was sparked by work on environmentally sensitive areas in her Earth Science group at NASA. ""Periodically, UAVs get lost -- for example on coral reefs or in other sensitive habitats,"" she said in an interview with the project team. ""As I started to hear about this, I thought, 'Well, wouldn't it be useful if the UAV was biodegradable, so if it crashed somewhere that was sensitive, it wouldn't matter if it dissolved."" The mushroom-like substance known as mycelium, which makes up the chassis of the drone, is being hailed as the new plastic -- a plastic that has the advantage of degrading quickly. The team grew cellulose ""leather""  to coat the fungal body of the flying craft and then covered the sheets with proteins sourced from the saliva of paper wasps -- a water resistant material that the insects use to cover their nests. The circuits are printed from silver nanoparticle ink in an effort to make the machine as biodegradable as possible. Despite a heavy preponderance of biological parts, the team said the project had its limits. ""There are definitely parts that can't be replaced by biology, "" said Stanford University's Raman Nelakanti. At its first short flight at the International Genetically Engineered Machine competition in Boston, the team used a standard battery, motor and propellers to fly the drone. Nevertheless, the team is working on making other parts biodegradable and is studying how to build its sensors from modified E. coli bacteria, the bacteria most commonly found in the intestines of humans and animals. The team said that ultimately the drone could be sent into areas where it might not be expected to return such as wildfires or nuclear accidents, sending data and never coming back. While the parts degrade naturally, the team also experimented with enzymes that would help the drone self-destruct, breaking it down further on impact. Creating a drone that does not infect the environment has been another challenge for the team. ""If you have living organisms acting as biosensors and the plane crashes, there certainly could be problems as the plane interacts with the environment,"" Rothschild said. ""Hopefully people could think of this in advance, and design such that this never becomes a problem. ""For example, on crashing, the cells might die. Or the cells could be attenuated. There are all sorts of other processes to keep them from contaminating the environment. But that, to me, is the largest concern with a biological UAV - having living things on the UAV.""

"Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians gathered in Gaza in a show of support for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah Party on Friday, the 48th anniversary of the party's founding. Palestine Liberation Organization leaders say Fatah was officially founded in 1965 which coincided with its first major attack against Israel. It was an unusual scene in Gaza because it was the first mass rally showing open support for Fatah since 2007. That is the year Hamas seized control of Gaza from Fatah, which now controls only the West Bank. The number of people who showed up surprised many. Some participants slept in the Gaza City square after gathering there overnight and the crowds eventually grew so large by daytime that at least seven of the major streets around the rally were filled with people. What is Hamas? High-level Fatah Party officials also showed up for the event after entering Gaza for the first time since being ousted by Hamas. Leaders of both parties described it as another step toward unity. Abbas sent a message via video from his headquarters in the West Bank town of Ramallah that was played on huge screens set up in Gaza. ""Gaza was the first Palestinian territory to get rid of the occupation and settlement, and we want the blockage to be lifted so that it can be free and be linked to the rest of the nation,"" Abbas said. An SMS sent out from a Hamas representative referred to the rally as a ""celebration of national unity and a success for both Hamas and Fatah."" According to the Gaza ambulance service, at least 30 people were injured after fighting broke out due to overcrowding as well as political rivalry among supporters of different political leaders. In advance of the rally there also was bickering between Fatah and Hamas over whether Hamas would allow Fatah supporters to gather in a large space that was highly visible. In the end an agreement was worked out and the festivities progressed with some people holding Fatah flags and others waving pictures of Abbas and late Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat. The two parties have been bitter rivals for years, but the relationship between the two parties thawed after the recent fighting between Israel and Gaza that lasted eight days and left dozens dead. After the conflict, Hamas was given approval to hold its first rally in the West Bank, and a few weeks later Hamas allowed Fatah to hold a rally in Gaza. Hamas considered it a victory when Israel decided not to send in ground troops. Days later, Abbas' ability to get non-member-state status for the Palestinian territories at the United Nations was also considered a victory. Since then there has been talk of reconciliation from leaders of both parties, but no concrete steps have surfaced yet. Fatah leadership has had a great deal of support from the West and has been warned over the years not to join hands with militant Hamas, which several countries have deemed a terrorist organization.","It is the first mass rally in Gaza showing open support for Fatah since 2007 .

"(CNN)  -- In graduate school and as a mountaineer and nature photographer, I've visited many of the world's great mountain ranges and seen hundreds of glaciers. In spite of this, I didn't understand how fast truly enormous quantities of ice could disappear until 2005 when I went to Iceland and shot a story for The New Yorker magazine. This led to a 2006 National Geographic magazine assignment to document changing glaciers in various parts of the Northern Hemisphere and South America. By the time this cover story was done, the Extreme Ice Survey was born. EIS merges art and science to give visual voice to the planet's changing ecosystems. Through time-lapse imagery and other innovative methods, EIS documents and communicates environmental impacts from global warming and other human-made causes while inspiring action among citizens and policymakers. Time-lapse photography captures the speed at which glaciers are retreating in places such as Greenland, Iceland, Alaska, the Alps and the Rocky Mountains. Watch video and see EIS project here. EIS is a collaboration between image-makers and leading environmental scientists, all of us devoted to documenting the changes transforming Arctic and alpine landscapes today. We do this because shrinking glaciers are the canary in the global coal mine, the most visible, tangible manifestations of climate change on the planet. The survey is extreme in every way -- distances, costs, logistics, field conditions. Truth be told, there are times when I wonder why I'm putting myself through this ordeal. But other voices, asking different questions, ultimately provide the answers. I picture myself 30 years from now. I hear my daughters Simone and Emily saying with a certain amount of anger and exasperation: ""Dad, with what everyone knew back in 2009, how could people not have realized the climate was changing?"" And then they ask the personal zinger: ""What were you doing about it?"" Hindsight can be merciless. People of any given era often look back in time and wonder how their predecessors could have been so dimwitted. How could the British navy have taken hundreds of years to make limes and other antiscorbutics a standard part of sailors' diets? The cure for scurvy was known to European navigators as early as the 1500s. During three epic voyages of the 1770s, Capt. James Cook forced his crews to eat sauerkraut, which was later shown to be rich in vitamin C. He lost not a single man to the disease. Yet the British admiralty waited until 1867 before mandating that its sailors eat limes to stay healthy. When the future looks back at the late 20th and early 21st centuries, people will be as astounded at our mule-headedness about dealing with climate change, as we now are at the foibles of earlier societies. Unfortunately, the astonishing pace of climatic events, as witnessed in the ice, doesn't give us the luxury of time to be slow learners. We cannot afford to be hamstrung by ponderous social institutions or deluded by false information. We must make a major effort to stop climate change right now, and not think we can absolve ourselves of responsibility by educating our children to do things differently. A generation from now will be too late. The voices of the future -- our grown-up children -- will damn us if we are passive and indifferent. As I head to Copenhagen, Denmark, for the United Nations Climate Change Conference, I hope to bring the extraordinary evidence of melting glaciers that my colleagues and I at the Extreme Ice Survey have worked so hard to collect to both the climate-change believers and the skeptics. I hope to attract even more widespread attention to this critical issue, because if we rise to the occasion demanded by a changing climate, we will be heroes. Descend into collective complacency and dysfunctional denial, and we will someday be judged to have been fools. Sir Edmund Hillary once said about great deeds, ""People do not decide to become extraordinary. They do extraordinary things."" The quality of our society and our lives will be judged by the deeds we do or don't do. Once upon a time, I was a climate-change skeptic. I'm not one anymore. The evidence is in the ice. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Balog.","James Balog says he didn't know how fast enormous quantities of ice were vanishing .

"Washington (CNN)Ann Romney, the wife of former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, condemned South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley's Democratic challenger after he mistakenly called her a ""whore"" — and then chuckled. ""When I first heard about it, it hit me right in my gut,"" Romney said in a Monday phone interview with CNN. ""My nerve endings went haywire. It's so upsetting when you know someone can say something like that about a woman, and not have any kind of reaction. It's so unacceptable. Nikki is a great girl and has been a great governor."" The Democrat, Vincent Sheheen, made the comment at a campaign event late last week in Florence. In the midst of attacking Haley's education record, Sheheen stumbled over his words and told the crowd, ""We are going to escort whore out the door."" The slip-of-the-tongue was clearly accidental, and Sheheen immediately corrected himself, saying, ""We're going to escort her out the door."" But when some in the audience picked up on the verbal faux pas and started applauding, Sheheen grinned and laughed along with people in the crowd. Video of the event went viral. Sheheen apologized for the moment in a radio interview on Monday. ""But if anybody heard, and certainly my words were garbled ... I apologize because I don't want to send that message to anybody,"" he said, according to The State newspaper. Haley leads Sheheen by double digits in recent polling and is expected to win a second term next week. Romney, who came to know Haley during the 2012 presidential campaign when she was one of the Mitt Romney's top GOP supporters, said she spoke to the governor by phone about the flare-up. Romney said the incident is discouraging to women who want to be in the political arena. Haley, she noted, weathered attacks on her personal life and her Indian-American heritage in past campaigns. ""We need to make sure we have a safe place so that other women can feel like they can do this and these kinds of things aren't going to happen to them,"" Romney said. ""You get so sick of saying there is bias out there, but if a Republican had said this, it would be blowing up in their face like nobody's business. Where is EMILY's List? Where is N.O.W.? Where are they?"" Romney aides made her available for an interview on Sheheen's comments. Her remarks come amid heightened interest in whether her husband will launch a third bid for the White House. She said the family has no timeline for making a decision. ""A lot of people are talking about it, but honestly Mitt and I aren't,"" Romney said. ""Mitt has been very clear. Events may change. We don't see them changing. But you are never going to say never. Right now we are looking to see these other candidates come forward."" Ann Romney still done with 2016, but never say never . She offered a larger critique of the so-called Republican ""war on women"" — a campaign strategy that Democrats used to devastating effect against Romney in 2012. Romney argued that the message has lost its potency in 2014, though Democrats say women's issues have kept them in the hunt in several tight Senate races from Colorado to North Carolina. ""People are saying, this isn't working anymore,"" Romney said. ""It was a ploy in the last election. I think they thought it was effective, and they are trying again this cycle. But I hope the electorate is getting tired of these broad brush statements that work on people's emotions, that are inaccurate, that try to marginalize one candidate or another. I get even more upset when I see other women trying to use these tactics and approaches. We have to be better than that.""

"Sen. Tim Kaine said Wednesday there's no legal authority for the current U.S. mission against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. ""We have been engaged in a war -- that is not about imminent defense of the United States -- without legal authority,"" the Virginia Democrat said at the Wilson Center on Wednesday, ahead of a panel discussion on the legal authority for military intervention, moderated by CNN's Jim Sciutto. The mission is not covered by either the wording or intent of the 2001 and 2002 authorizations for use of military force as the White House argues, Kaine said, adding that such an argument is ""ridiculous"" and inconsistent with President Barack Obama's previously stated interpretation of the AUMF. Kaine, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has proposed a new, limited authorization, specifically targeted to the current mission against ISIS. ""We should deal with it right away,"" he said, stressing that it could be accomplished in the lame-duck session in Congress. Rand Paul on ISIS response: 'This war is now illegal' He's also calling for changes to the War Powers Resolution that will result in a ""better process"" for war authorization. In a statement last week, Kaine said he was ""encouraged"" by Obama's recent willingness to work with Congress on a new authorization, but also ""troubled by suggestions today that Congress should wait until the new Congressional session in 2015 to take this vote."" ""We have already asked too many U.S. service members to risk their lives without a political consensus behind this mission,"" he added. What to expect from the lame duck Congress . The current AUMF was passed in 2001, just days after the 9/11 attacks. Though the language of the authorization only covers military action against those who ""planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons,"" in recent years it has been used to cover action against any group or individual the administration considers associated with al Qaeda. A second authorization for use of military force against Iraq was passed in 2002, permitting the president to ""defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq"" and ""enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.""","Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine argues that the fight against ISIS has not been legally authorized .

"The execution of Clayton Lockett was halted after a doctor acknowledged that because of problems in administering the drugs, there were not enough left to carry out the death sentence, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections said Thursday. The revelation came as Oklahoma's governor called for an investigation into the attempted execution that, according to some witnesses, left Lockett writhing in pain after a vein collapsed. A new and previously unused drug combination was reportedly used in the attempted execution. A timeline released by the state Department of Corrections details what occurred after Lockett's execution was abruptly halted and a shade was lowered, blocking the view of witnesses. ""The doctor checked the IV and reported the blood vein had collapsed, and the drugs had either absorbed into tissue, leaked out or both,"" according to the timeline. The director of the corrections department then asked whether Lockett had been given enough of the drug combination to kill him, and the doctor said ""no."" ""Is another vein available? And if so, are there enough drugs remaining?"" the doctor was asked, according to the timeline. The doctor's answer to both questions: ""No."" Lockett's attempted execution was carried out Tuesday at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, where he had been housed following his conviction and death sentence for shooting Stephanie Nieman and then watching as two others buried her alive in 1999. Lockett died from an apparent heart attack, 43 minutes after the execution began. The autopsy on Lockett, being conducted at Southwestern Institute for Forensic Science in Dallas, will take up to 12 weeks, Capt. George Brown of the Oklahoma Department of Prisons said. He did not offer an explanation for the length of time for the autopsy. According to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, its execution protocol includes midazolam, which causes unconsciousness, vecuronium bromide, which stops respiration, and potassium chloride, which is meant to stop the heart. What follows is the Department of Corrections timeline of the execution: . -- At 5:22 p.m. local time, Lockett is restrained on the execution table. -- Between 5:27 p.m. and 6:18 p.m., he is examined by a phlebotomist, who examines his arms, legs and feet for appropriate veins to administer drugs. -- At 6:18 p.m., an IV is inserted into a vein in Lockett's groin area, and his lower body is then covered with a sheet. -- At 6:23 p.m., the curtain in the execution chamber is raised, and the doctor administers the first drug intravenously. -- At 6:30 p.m., Lockett is still conscious. -- At 6:33 p.m., the doctor declares Lockett is unconscious and begins to administer the second and third drugs. -- At 6:42 p.m., the curtain is lowered. -- At 6:44 p.m., the doctor checks the IV and reports Lockett's vein has collapsed. -- Between 6:44 p.m. and 6:56 p.m., the prison warden calls Department of Corrections Director Robert Patton and reports the information. The director asks the doctor a number of questions regarding Lockett's condition: . The warden ""responded the doctor was checking the offender's heart beat and found a faint heart beat and the offender was unconscious,"" according to the timeline. -- At 7:06 p.m., Lockett is declared dead. There is nothing in the timeline that echoes the statements of witnesses, primarily journalists, who said 16 minutes into the execution Lockett was writhing in pain and appeared to be conscious. According to Courtney Francisco of CNN affiliate KFOR, Lockett seemed to try to get up and to talk, saying ""man"" aloud. Other reporters -- including Cary Aspinwall of the Tulsa World newspaper -- claimed that Lockett was ""still alive,"" having lifted his head while prison officials lowered the blinds, blocking the view of the proceedings. Charles Warner was scheduled to be executed later that night at the same prison. His execution has been postponed, at least temporarily. Lockett and Warner had been at the center of a court fight over the drugs used in their execution. They'd initially challenged the state Department of Corrections' unwillingness to divulge which drugs would be used. The department later disclosed the substances. Lockett and Warner also took issue with the state's so-called secrecy provision forbidding it from disclosing the identities of anyone involved in the execution process or suppliers of any drugs or medical equipment. Oklahoma's high court initially issued stays on their executions, only to lift those stays last week, ruling the two men had no right to know the source of the drugs intended to kill them.","Clayton Lockett's execution in Oklahoma was halted 33 minutes after it began .

"A controversial new Texas law requiring voters to present personal identification before going to the polls has been blocked by the Obama administration. In a letter Monday to state officials, the Justice Department said the legislation could have a discriminatory effect on Hispanics and other minorities. Texas is among eight states to require official photo identification in an effort to stop what officials say is voter fraud. Opponents of the laws say they disenfranchise poor, minority and disabled voters. The department concluded there is little evidence of voter fraud in Texas warranting the legislative changes. ""We note that the state's submission did not include evidence of significant in-person voter impersonation not already addressed by the state's existing laws,"" said Thomas Perez, assistant attorney general. The landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 gives the federal government the power to oversee any changes in voting procedures in states and jurisdictions with a  history of voter discrimination. Texas' new voting boundaries for congressional and legislative seats are also being challenged separately in federal court. The Justice Department, relying on statistics provided by the state, said Hispanics in particular would be negatively affected by the Texas law. ""Under the data provided in January, Hispanics make up only 21.8% of all registered voters, but fully 38.2% of the registered voters who lack these forms of identification. Thus, we conclude that the total number of registered voters who lack a driver's license or personal identification card issued by (the state Department of Public Safety) could range from 603,892 to 795,955,"" Perez said in the letter, addressed to the director of elections for the Texas secretary of state. ""Even using the data most favorable to the state, Hispanics disproportionately lack either a driver's license or a personal identification card ... and that disparity is statistically significant,"" Perez said. A similar voter ID law in South Carolina was blocked by the Obama administration in December. Texas and South Carolina now have the option of asking a federal court in Washington to review the laws, and allow them to be enforced this election year. Texas Gov. Rick Perry released a statement soon after the Justice Department's decision was announced, slamming it as ""yet another example of the Obama administration's continuing and pervasive federal overreach."" ""The DOJ has no valid reason for rejecting this important law, which requires nothing more extensive than the type of photo identification necessary to receive a library card or board an airplane,"" he said. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott has defended the law, saying it imposes ""minor inconveniences on exercising the right to vote."" Voters in the state would be required to present one of seven types of government-issued photo identification, including a driver's license, a passport or a concealed handgun permit. Those lacking the ID would be given a provisional ballot, but the voter would have to present an approved document to the registrar's office within six days after the election. Those lacking an acceptable identification would be given a free voter identification card. Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act has been used by federal authorities for decades to oversee election changes in 16 states or selected areas, including parts of New York City. Texas and other jurisdictions have chafed at the requirements, saying there has been no recent government effort to discriminate. They argue they should not continue to have the burden of showing that any voting changes would not burden or interfere with someone's ability to vote. Opponents of the voter ID law in Texas have said minority voter turnout could be suppressed 3% to 5% at a time when the Hispanic population there is growing rapidly. There have also been complaints the new law has not been sufficiently publicized. ""Texas' voter ID law would prevent countless Latinos, African-Americans, elderly citizens and others from casting their ballot,"" said Katie O'Connor, a staff attorney with the ACLU's Voting Rights Project. ""We're pleased the Department of Justice has recognized the harms this discriminatory law would have on people's fundamental right to vote."" The Justice Department said Hispanic registered voters in Texas are 46.5% to 120% more likely than a non-Hispanic registered voter to lack the required identification. The nation's second largest state has a population of 25.1 million, an increase of 4.3 million in the past decade. That explosive growth ensures Texas will gain four congressional seats, requiring new voting boundaries that are still being litigated in court. The Supreme Court in January ordered a special federal court in Texas to reconsider its rejection of the maps approved by the state's Republican majority.","Texas Gov.

Then, three Israelis were stabbed at a hitchhiking post near the entrance to a settlement in the West Bank, police said. One of the three, a 24-year-old woman, was killed, emergency services said. In both incidents, the attackers were ""terrorists,"" police said. The incidents came amid simmering tensions -- not just between Israel and Palestinians, but between rival Palestinian factions as well. ""The atmosphere of violence rides the wave of Palestinian incitement,"" Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said on Twitter. After the Tel Aviv stabbing, a Palestinian suspect from Nablus in the West Bank was arrested ""with the help of eyewitnesses while he was hiding in an apartment building in the fourth floor nearby the central bus station,"" police spokeswoman Luba Samri said. The victim, a member of the Israel Defense Forces, was taken to a hospital in serious condition, police said. After the stabbings at the Alon Shvut junction in the West Bank, the attacker was shot by a security guard, police said. The junction is the same site where three Israeli teens were kidnapped and later found dead, ultimately sparking an Israeli military campaign targeting Hamas in Gaza called Operation Protective Edge. The incidents Monday -- the latest in a string of attacks -- came amid a new round of infighting between Palestinian factions. The political party Fatah said Sunday it will scrap a series of events to commemorate the death 10 years ago of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The group blamed rival faction Hamas, saying it is behind a series of bombings at the homes of Fatah leaders. Hamas denounced the attacks, according to the Facebook page of spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri. Fatah controls the West Bank, and Hamas controls Gaza. While the parties have fought violent battles in the past, they've made repeated announcements of plans to form a unity government as well. On Saturday, Israeli police shot and killed a Palestinian man who attacked police officers with a knife in a village in northern Israel, police said. There were conflicting accounts of exactly what happened. Israel has been facing what some call an ""auto intifada"" -- a spate of attacks on Jewish civilians in Jerusalem by Palestinians driving vehicles. Hamas said it ""blesses the action. What is happening in Jerusalem is pushing us to prepare for war."" Violence has recently involved the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism and one of the three holiest sites in Islam. It's known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif, or the Noble Sanctuary, and Jews are allowed to visit the site but not to pray there. A Palestinian recently shot and critically wounded a rabbi, Yehuda Glick, who campaigns for the right of Jews to pray at the site. After an Israeli counterterrorism unit shot and killed the assailant hours later, Palestinian Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas -- part of Fatah in the West Bank -- wrote to the assailant's family saying he would ""go to heaven as a martyr defending the rights of our people and its holy places.""

"Pope Francis created 19 new cardinals Saturday in a ceremony in the Vatican's St. Peter's Basilica -- the first such appointments since he was elected pontiff last March. The new cardinals come from countries around the world, hailing from as far afield as Brazil, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, South Korea and Haiti. The pope presented them with the traditional biretta, or red cap, and ring at a formal ceremony called a public consistory. The scarlet color of the cap symbolizes the cardinals' willingness to die for their faith. Looking frail, Benedict, the Pope Emeritus, lined up with the existing cardinals for the ceremony in the historic church. When last year he became the first pope in almost six centuries to stand down, Benedict said he would live a life of seclusion and study. His presence in St. Peter's Basilica alongside that of Francis and the cardinals who will one day vote for his successor is a highly unusual event. Francis spoke . Sixteen of the new cardinals are under the age of 80, making them eligible to elect a new pope when the time comes, according to Vatican Radio. Three of them are over age 80 and ""are chosen for their distinguished service"" to the Vatican and the Roman Catholic Church, it said. One of those is 98-year-old Archbishop Loris Capovilla, who was the secretary of Pope John XXIII. He was not present for the ceremony, but will be presented with his biretta in the coming days. Two of the newly appointed cardinals already hold top Vatican positions -- Archbishop Pietro Parolin is its secretary of state, while Archbishop Gerhard Mueller is head of the church's chief doctrinal office, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. No Americans were named among the new members of the college of cardinals, but there is one Canadian, Quebec Archbishop Gerald Cyprien Lacroix. Francis: Not a promotion . In a letter sent last month to the chosen clergy, Francis gave some words of advice about remaining humble. Becoming a cardinal ""does not signify a promotion, an honor nor a decoration: it is simply a service that demands a broader vision and a bigger heart,"" he said. ""And, although it seems a paradox, this ability to look further and love more universally with greater intensity can be acquired only by following the way of the Lord: The way of lowliness and of humility, taking the form of a servant."" Commenting last month on the clergy named by Francis, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi highlighted the geographical range and diversity of the countries they come from. ""The choice of cardinals of Burkina Faso and Haiti shows concern for people struck by poverty,"" he is quoted as saying by Vatican Radio.","Pope Francis presents the new cardinals with their traditional red cap and ring .

"London's taxi drivers are famed for cramming their brains with an encyclopedic knowledge of the city's backstreets that allows them to swerve around any traffic jam. But on Wednesday many were stuck in gridlock of their own making as they joined other cabbies across Europe staging protests against Uber, a mobile phone app they say threatens their livelihoods. Uber customers can use their phones to flag down private cabs then meter the charges based on the length of journey. Drivers of London's black taxis say that shouldn't be allowed. They say they've earned a monopoly on picking up passengers on the fly and billing by meter through years of study to memorize the city's tangled street map. To make their point, hundreds of drivers took their black cabs into central London for a horn-tooting drive around Trafalgar Square and past the UK's Houses of Parliament, bringing traffic to a standstill. Police, who wanted the protest limited to a strict one-hour timeframe, threatened drivers with fines and arrest. ""The long and the short of it is, allowing [a company like Uber] to come in and say they're a tech company, that they don't want to be licensed ... is not fair,"" said Steve Garelick, a union official representing licensed London taxi drivers. Several European cities saw similar protests. All-out strike . In Madrid many drivers stayed home for the day with Spanish media reporting an all-out strike. In France there were reports of taxis blockading roads in Paris and other cities. Demonstrations were also staged in Germany and Italy. In London, transport officials condemned the protest which one report said would cost the city Â£125 million ($210 million). Garrett Emmerson, a spokesman for Transport for London, said it was a ""pointless disruption for Londoners over a legal issue."" Emmerson said his organization had called on the UK's High Court to make a ruling on what constituted a ""taximeter."" Uber, valued at $18 billion, has millions of customers and is expanding its operations to 128 cities in 37 countries. Its founder, Travis Kalanick, told CNN he often sees a backlash in cities where it gains market clout. ""It's really common when we really succeed in a city that the incumbents -- the taxi industry -- are often trying to protect a monopoly that's been granted to them by local officials. They're trying to slow down competition,"" he said. The company said it had benefited from Wednesday's protests, registering an 850% leap in app downloads on the previous week.

"Anthony Box, 17, is your typical all-American boy. He spends his time studying, chilling with his school friends, and riding a unicycle. Except Anthony is living for a year in Beijing with a Chinese family. He's part of the School Year Abroad program, which recently partnered with the ambitious ""100,000 Strong Foundation"" that aims to strengthen often frosty U.S.-China relations, one teenager at a time. The organization says it has already achieved its aim of having more than 100,000 U.S. students in China. However, the numbers of American students in China are dwarfed by the 235,500 Chinese currently studying in America. Their ranks include Shunshun Zhang, 18, who spent three years studying at a high school in Vermont. Can Anthony and Shunshun succeed where presidents and diplomats have failed and bridge the gap between the two superpowers? Here are their stories. US, China reach historic climate change deal . Anthony Box studies in Beijing and lives with a Chinese family. Many of my American classmates thought it was insane to leave America and go to school for a year in China.  I'm interested in foreign languages and cultures and China has always piqued my interest. The most surprising thing that I encountered here was the large number of people living, working, and moving around in Beijing. When I ride my unicycle, hordes of people stop what they are doing just to stare in amazement. It's also helped me realize that in Beijing the herd mentality is a very common thing. Before arriving in China, I believed that many locals would be unwelcoming to foreigners like myself but that's totally inaccurate. The Chinese people I meet are always friendly and willing to help. On weekends, I go to Beijing's numerous parks and chat with the local people.  Many of the elders love to explain the history of China and talk about their childhood, which allows me to understand the richness and nuances of China's culture. The language barrier has been the main challenge. In the beginning, there were only a few topics that I could comfortably speak about with my host parents.  Conversations were limited often out of fear that I would run out of words to say or I would not understand. I've started to move out of my comfort zone and can speak about many different things such as Beijing's pollution, traffic and divorce. Living with a Chinese family has been wonderful. I wake up in the morning and eat breakfast with them. They help me understand and navigate Chinese culture.  I consider and treat my host family as if they were my own family at home.  And, I feel very fortunate in that that they treat me like their own son. My school back home is larger so I'm unable to get to know every student and faculty member, but my school in China is much smaller.  This also allows for the students and teachers to have a more personal relationship with each other. Colorful economic summit ends with rare news conference in Beijing . Shunshun Zhang recently graduated after studying at a high school in Vermont for three years. He will attend the University of Iowa next year to study mathematics. I have been living with Chapman family in a small Vermont village called Post Mills. My host parents are the sweetest couple and best parents I have met. Without their help, I would not have fitted into life here so fast. My three host siblings have helped me a lot in both my academic and social life.  At first, I thought it would be very hard for me to make friends among the high school students but within the first few weeks I was proved wrong. On the first day I arrived Ella, Cole (my homestay sister and brother) and Andy, one of their friends, took me to swim in a lake. Everyone in the school is friendly and willing to help me with anything. I couldn't believe that I used to think that the students were all mean. I made many friends through the soccer team, photography club and my classes. I think the most shocking thing to me is the togetherness of local community and my high school. I grew up in Beijing and I never experienced country life and every family seems like a small part of a bigger family. I also did community service with my host siblings and friends. For example, we helped stack wood for our neighbor, and my school even has a fund raising day -- every student helped raise money for children in Zimbabwe to go to school. I think the idea of sharing and unity in this community really taught me something. I think China and the U.S. have two complete different educational systems. Each system has its own advantages and they both fit their own country. I chose to go to an American high school because I wanted to experience more -- I found the U.S. education system to be more attractive to me. There are a lot of things that I would never have learned and experienced if I went to school in Beijing. My high school in the U.S. offers many more diverse classes compared to schools in China. I could choose any class I like such as drama and film analysis. Students could even start a new course with a mentor. For example, I was interested in photography and I was able to do it in my high school with a professional photographer. I was also the editor of the school yearbook. I never thought that the knowledge I learned from school could be so diverse. I felt that I became a real member of the Chapman family. We spent time together and we shared the housework. They treated me as one of their own. I am really thankful that I could have three unforgettable years in Vermont. 24 hours with President Obama in China .","Relations between the United States and China are often tense .

"(CNN) -- Though we're still in the early stages of 2014, it is already proving one of the most expensive years for the travel industry. According to masFlight, an enterprise software company that crunches big data for the transport and logistics sectors, January's bizarre weather patterns have already cost passengers flying into and out of the U.S. $2.5 billion, and airlines between $75m and $150m because of canceled and delayed flights. ""It's not easy for an airline to recoup losses resulting from an aircraft being delayed or canceled,"" says Tulinda Larsen, masFlight's vice president of business development. ""The cost of pilots that don't take off, the crew overtime, reimbursing tickets -- those costs aren't easy to make up."" For passengers, a plane stuck on the tarmac can cost more than aggravation and the price of a ticket. Even with a refund, stranded fliers are stuck with the bill for hotel rooms, taxis, rental cars, food and other unanticipated expenses. ""On average, a canceled flight takes a passenger an additional 18 hours of travel time to get to their destination,"" Larsen explains. ""During that time, they're going to incur costs they weren't anticipating, costs the airlines don't have a responsibility to cover, so that passengers are going to be out of pocket."" According to flight-tracking website FlightAware, this has been the worst year on record for cancellations in the US. Since December 1, 2013, nearly 90,000 flights have been canceled. ""Domestically, it's been a terrible year. By the end of January, we've has as many cancellations as we usually see through mid-April,"" says Mark Duell, FlightAware's vice president of operations. Regional airlines were the most affected by the weather, though none as severely as JetBlue, which saw its revenue for January reduced by $45 million. ""While we generally have a strong ability to recapture revenue when we cancel flights during weather events by re-accommodating, our re-booking options for our customers during this high-traffic period were very limited,"" admits JetBlue spokeswoman Tamara Young. According to Larsen, however, the weather in-and-of itself wasn't what grounded millions of flyers, but the airline's capacity to handle them. Larsen blames two government regulations for the issue, the first issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation delaying the amount of time a plane is allowed to stay on the tarmac to three hours (and imposing $27,500 in fines for carriers that don't comply), and the second is a restriction on how long pilots can remain on duty. ""Those are two artificial policy restraints that airlines are working with operationally,"" she says. Another issue is airlines stuffing planes to capacity, meaning when there are cancellations or delays, there is less flexibility in booking passengers on an alternative flight. ""Load factor is the highest it's been in history. It's not easy to re-accommodate passengers a couple of days later,"" Duell notes. Given the likelihood that this year's bizarre weather patterns are possibly a result of climate change, and could become less of an anomaly and more the norm, one wonders how airlines are prepared to adjust in future years. Duell recons one bad winter won't be enough to spur airlines to action. ""No one will look at one winter and decide to spend a lot of money they don't have,"" he says. ""But I think if we see a lot of bad winters in a row, airlines will invest in more tools, processes, and procedures to help them recover."" Read more: Passengers behaving badly .

"Eager to highlight signs of an economy on the rebound, President Barack Obama launched a midterm election effort Thursday designed to convince voters of a vigorous recovery that a majority still doubts. At stake: the power to get anything done in Washington during the final quarter of his presidency. ""I want people the know there are some really good things happening in America,"" Obama declared at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management in Chicago, both summarizing his election-year pitch and capturing the political problem inherent in having to describe an economic recovery that many Americans still aren't feeling. ""Sometimes the noise clutters and I think confuses the nature of the reality out there,"" he said before listing his economic achievements, including bailing out the American automobile sector and reducing the rolls of people without health insurance. And despite his assertion that Thursday's remarks didn't amount to a ""political speech,"" Obama took sharp aim at Republicans who have blocked his economic agenda on Capitol Hill. ""A true opposition party should have the courage to lay out their agenda,"" he said, slamming GOP efforts to cut taxes for top earners. ""Nearly all the gains of the recovery have gone to the top 1%, so I find that a little hard to swallow,"" he said, in one stroke jabbing Republicans while highlighting the problems he faces in selling an economic recovery that millions of Americans have yet to feel. Although Obama can cite statistics that show a renewed U.S. economy, many Americans are still feeling battered by the downturn's legacy: stagnant wages and not enough full-time work. In a CNN/ORC survey released Thursday, 57% of those polled said the nation's economy was poor, compared with 42% who described conditions as good. While still underwater, those numbers reflect an improvement in the economic mood of the nation. A year ago, only 29% of Americans thought the economy was good, and polls taken between then and now show a steady rise in the number of people who are feeling better about the country's economic state. The question is whether Obama gets any credit: A CNN/ORC poll conducted in late September showed that 56% of respondents didn't approve of how the president is handling the economy. Key Midterm races to watch . Part of his challenge is explaining why the economic recovery has been so good to the coastal rich while leaving poor and middle-class Americans struggling. The poll released Thursday showed Americans who earn north of $100,000 per year, and those living in the Northeast and West, far more likely to describe economic conditions as good. ""Our broader economy in the aggregate has come a long way, but the gains of recovery aren't yet broadly shared or at least not broadly shared enough,"" Obama said Thursday. ""The stress that families feel -- that's real. It's still harder than it should be to pay the bills and put away some money. Even when you're working your tail off, it's harder than it should be to get ahead."" As long as Americans keep citing the economy as their top issue, as they did by a wide margin in CNN's latest survey, the White House will attempt to drive home the message that things are a lot better than they were six years ago. ""Most people this fall are going to vote on economic issues,"" said Jay Carney, Obama's former press secretary, now a CNN contributor. ""Like they often do, except in those circumstances like post-9/11 where they perceive an existential threat to the United States."" With a little more than a month to go before November's vote, Obama has spent the bulk of his political energy delivering the economic message to Democratic donors at high-dollar fundraisers. He has yet to make an appearance at a campaign rally for a Democrats, though he's expected to appear with candidates as Election Day nears.","Obama says economy is doing better despite remaining hardships .

"Do we need women in the front lines of journalism? Don't doubt it for a second. We all suffered a terrible loss when an Afghan policeman shot and killed the extraordinarily talented AP photographer Anja Niedringhaus last week. We lost the ability to see the world through Niedringhaus' compelling lens. We lost her insight, and we lost what would have come from her commitment to helping us understand the complexities of our world. Most of all, we lost the benefits of her unique ability to show us the connection between historical events and individual human beings. Niedringhaus and her close friend, AP correspondent Kathy Gannon, were covering the run-up to elections when an Afghan policeman walked toward their car, shouted ""Allahu akbar"" and shot them both. Gannon, also a veteran journalist with vast experience covering the world's most dangerous places, was injured. The shooting, as it happens, came shortly after the Women's Media Center released its report, ""The Status of Women in the U.S. Media 2014."" The snapshot taken in the last quarter of 2013 found men still had almost two-thirds of all bylines and on-camera appearances in the major newspapers, television networks, newswire services and online news sites. We have seen notable improvements over the years, but the report points to ""a troubling status quo and, in some places, a slipping back in time."" Women journalists remain concentrated in ""women's"" subjects such as family, style and health. That means we are looking and trying to understand the world mostly through men's eyes when it comes to foreign affairs, justice and politics. This is not just a matter of concern to women journalists. We are all shortchanged when women are subtly edged out of reporting on major world news. Is there a difference in men and women's reporting? Despite the gender bias, there are hundreds of female journalists around the world, many covering -- some dying -- in conflict zones. Women give us the hard news, the politics, the strategy, the conflict. I won't argue here whether women are more sensitive in their coverage. But I will tell you this: Women listen to other women much more closely, and they pay much greater attention to how political and military developments affect individuals, particularly other women. Consider this: Long before 9/11, Afghanistan had turned into a hell-on-Earth for women under the ultraextremist, hypermisogynistic Taliban, who made even the sound of women's laughter a crime.   A CDC study found Afghan women suffered among the highest levels of depression anywhere in the world -- levels that were, not surprisingly, much higher than for Afghan men. Now that the U.S. is about to leave Afghanistan, the prospect that hard-won gains will be reversed creates enormous fears for Afghan women. To see how this is covered, I googled three words: ""Afghan Women Fear.""  The first six news stories on the subject were all written by women. Read the six stories: Rights slipping away / Peace talk plans / Silenced by fear / More backsliding / Hope and fear / The future . Niedringhaus once wrote, ""For me it is about showing the struggle and survival of the individual."" You can see that clearly in her stunning pictures, especially on Afghanistan; in the image of a little girl struggling to see through her face-covering burqa, or a boy riding a merry-go-round while brandishing a toy machine gun, or in the gallery of portraits of the women in Afghanistan's parliament, the ones who have beaten the odds in a place where men's grip on power has been so hard to loosen. Gannon, too, has shown she can write about the hard edge of fighting and politics. But it's no coincidence that Gannon, a woman, is the one who took us to Malala's old school in Pakistan to show us how, despite the growing fame of the girl who was nearly killed for advocating education for girls, her former classmates are even more frightened than before. It's not all about the subject matter or the byline. The Women's Media Center found that men were quoted in The New York Times 3.4 times more often than women, but the number dropped when women wrote the story. To be sure, a number of women journalists have strong and respected voices. CNN's Christiane Amanpour is a major figure in international journalism, and both ABC News and the ""PBS NewsHour"" are anchored by distinguished women journalists. On the other side of the lens, you might be surprised to find countless talented and courageous women. When I was a CNN staffer, many of the network's top videographers were women. I still count many women friends among the people risking their lives covering conflict around the world. But international journalism remains firmly dominated by men, even though women are taking enormous risks in the field. As Kimberly Dozier -- also injured in a war zone -- explained, ""Anja and Kathy ... took risks almost no else covering the war was willing to take."" But they did it carefully, and ""only when they saw a story they thought needed to be told."" When it comes to news analysis and opinion -- a topic of particular interest to me -- the situation is just as bad, if not worse. Men opinion writers, according to the new report, outnumber women 4-to-1. That's barely an improvement over 2011, when the OpEd Project found women wrote just 20% of op-eds in the country's top newspapers, and were ""practically absent in the debate"" on hard news topics, writing just 13% of opinions on international politics and 11% of opinions on the economy. Women wrote about half of all commentary on food, recreation, family and style. We have made a lot of progress since the days when Eleanor Roosevelt started her weekly press conference open only to female journalists, partly as an effort to force newspapers to hire at least one woman. But there is a long way to go. We are still seeing the world mostly through men's eyes. We are still hearing it explained to us mostly by men. And for the one-third of stories that come from women, from the pictures we were fortunate to have thanks to Anja Niedringhaus, from the stories we've read thanks to Kathy Gannon, we know what a difference it makes to have women in the front lines of journalism. Don't doubt it for a second.","AP photographer was killed and reporter shot last week in Afghanistan .

"In his first public comments since the election, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid Wednesday pledged cooperation with Republicans when they take Senate control in January. But he also didn't hide his disdain for past GOP tactics. Reid pointedly promised not to engage in a ""strategy of obstruction,"" which he has accused Republicans of pursuing while Democrats were in charge. ""I am ready to work with him in good faith to make this institution function for the American people,"" Reid said while standing across the aisle from Sen. Mitch McConnell, who will take over as the next majority leader.  ""I saw first hand how a strategy of obstruction was debilitating to our system.  I have no desire to engage in that manner.""

We have a lot of work to do and no time to linger on the past,"" Reid said in floor remarks at the beginning of the lame duck session. Despite the tough rhetoric, Reid also complimented McConnell and said he holds him in the ""highest regards."" For his part, McConnell sounded emboldened when making his opening statement on the floor, immediately after Reid spoke. ""Last week the American people sent a strong message to Washington.  They voted for a new direction.  They called for a change in the way we do things in the Senate and they sent a new team to Washington to carry their wishes forward,"" he said.  ""We plan to do just that.

""President Obama has a duty to help build the trust we all need to move forward together, not to double down on old ways of doing business,"" he said. After both men spoke, they turned to each other and shook hands, something they don't do very often. Reid then slung his arm around McConnell's shoulders and they stared down at the floor together, sharing a few words. As they turned to leave, McConnell took Reid's forearm and gave it a light tug, as if to say to affirm a personal bond despite their hardened political opposition.","Harry Reid spoke on the Senate floor for the first time since the election .

"(CNN)Oracle Team USA will make its defense of the America's Cup in 2017 off the island of Bermuda, a British overseas territory in the Atlantic Ocean. The announcement was made Tuesday at a glitzy ceremony in New York, attended by Hollywood film stars Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones, who have been residents of Bermuda. It will be the first time that an American syndicate has defended the prestigious trophy in foreign waters in a competition dating back to 1851. ""In Bermuda we have a perfect international venue to demonstrate the excitement America's Cup boats and teams can generate,"" commercial commissioner Harvey Schiller was quoted on the event's official website. ""One spot,"" he said ""offered everything we needed to make the 2017 America's Cup an exceptional event."" The 2013 staging in San Francisco saw Oracle make a successful defense of the Cup in one of the most exciting finales in its history, beating Team New Zealand in the deciding race. New Zealand will join four other challengers, Artemis Racing of Sweden, the UK syndicate Ben Ainslie Racing, Luna Rossa Challenge from Italy and Team France, who will battle to earn the right to challenge Oracle for sailing's most prestigious honor. 62-foot catamarans have been chosen for the racing and Oracle's skipper Jimmy Spithill is already looking forward to the task ahead. ""Racing in Bermuda will be an incredible experience for the spectators, both on-site and for those watching the broadcast, and for the sailors, it's going to be very challenging,"" he said. ""I've raced there several times and the variety of conditions means you can never let your guard down. We'll all need to be at the top of our game to have success and that's how it should be."" It is a major boost for the economy of Bermuda, which is heavily reliant on tourism and financial services, fighting off the reported challenge of San Diego in California for the staging rights. Bermuda Premier Michael Dunkley said he hoped his island would host an ""unforgettable experience"" for those present or watching on television. ""We thank the America's Cup for their confidence in us -- and for their vision to evolve the experience for spectators and participants alike. ""This announcement today marks an exciting new chapter for Bermuda too. That our futures are linked in such a meaningful way will make for a great partnership,"" he said.

"Alexandria, Egypt (CNN) -- Emotional congregants returned to their church Sunday in Alexandria, Egypt, mourning the loss of fellow worshippers in a bombing a day earlier. Inside the Church of the Two Saints, grisly reminders of the explosion -- believed to be caused by a suicide bomber -- remained as tearful worshippers lighted candles to honor the dead. Broken glass and debris littered the church's interior and portions of the walls were splattered with blood. Outside, a heavy police presence guarded the church. At least 21 people were killed and 97 others injured in Saturday's blast, which occurred shortly after midnight as Coptic Christians were attending services at the church, according to Egyptian government officials. Evidence indicates that a suicide bomber caused the blast, the country's interior ministry said Saturday, though witnesses reported seeing a car parked outside the church explode. ""Why would my son or brother go to celebrate the mass by prayer, not by drinking or doing drugs or anything like that, but by praying in the church, and then this would happen to them at the church gate?"" one worshipper said Sunday. ""What religion or law, whatever it is, would approve what happened yesterday?"" Another worshipper at the church said she lost three family members in the attack. ""What did we do to them? Nothing! We live together (Copts and Muslims) and nothing happens. How would they do this to us, hurt us and make us orphans?"" she said. Copts, who are adherents of an Egyptian sect of Christianity, make up about 9% of the nation's population. About 90% of Egyptians are Muslims. A small group of Coptic men held a demonstration against the attack about a block away from the church Sunday. Tensions have been running high between Egypt's Muslim majority and minority Christians. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said in November that 10 Coptic Christian homes and several businesses were burned and looted in Qena province in southern Egypt following rumors of a romantic relationship between a Christian man and Muslim woman. World leaders, including U.S. President Barack Obama and Pope Benedict XVI, condemned Saturday's bombing. ""The perpetrators of this attack were clearly targeting Christian worshippers, and have no respect for human life and dignity,"" Obama said in a statement. ""They must be brought to justice for this barbaric and heinous act."" But Bishop Makar, the spokesman for the Church of the Two Saints, downplayed sectarian tensions in the region. ""In the beginning, we thought the attack was sectarian, to be honest,"" he said Sunday. ""But now we're quite certain that it has nothing to do with sectarianism especially that we have little sectarianism in Egypt. The vast majority are good and love each other. Here in our area by the way we have no sectarian issues at all."" A nearby mosque was also damaged in the blast and eight Muslims were among the wounded, the interior ministry said. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak called for a swift investigation of the ""criminal act"" and urged Egyptians to stand together ""in the face of ... terrorism and those who want to disrupt the nation's security, stability and unity of its people,"" presidential . spokesman Ambassador Sulaiman Awad said Saturday. Alexandria Gov. Adil Labib told state-run Nile TV that samples from the scene had been sent to a government lab as part of an investigation. Authorities believe the bomber was killed in the blast, Egypt's Interior Ministry said in a statement Saturday. Forensic testing confirmed that the explosive device used was homemade and contained nails and ball-bearings, the statement said. ""The attack targeted all Egyptians and not just our Coptic brethren,"" Labib said, according to the country's official Middle East News Agency (MENA). Mubarak has vowed to find the perpetrators of the attack, saying in an address to the nation Saturday that ""this terrorism act has shocked us, hurt hearts of the Egyptians, Muslims and Coptics.""

"(CNN)An early blast of cold air will leave more than half of the United States shivering into the weekend. About 200 million people will be affected by the severe cold,  CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri said. The unseasonably cold temperatures associated with an arctic air mass will continue to surge southward through the central United States. Temperatures are forecast to be 20 to 40 degrees below climate average for areas east of the Rockies into the Great Plains. The cold air will move toward the South by Wednesday morning, bringing freezing temperatures as far south as Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. It will reach the East Coast by Thursday, forecasters said. ""Early season cold outbreak will drift south and eastward across much of the eastern half of the country over the next several days,"" the National Weather Service said in a statement. By the time the weekend hits, hardly anyone in the eastern two-thirds of the nation will be spared. ""The next 10 days over the entire eastern half of the country will be below normal,"" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said Tuesday. In Wyoming, the wind chill is expected to be between 25 to 35 below zero. Experts warned residents not to stay outside for prolonged periods, and urged farmers to move livestock into a barn. ""The cold spell is about zero degrees, and we will get subzero overnight,"" said Mayor Rick Kaysen of Cheyenne, Wyoming. Residents flocked to grocery stores to stock up as they anticipated a hiatus from the outdoors. ""People are hunkered down at home, maybe sitting around the fireplace,"" Kaysen said. ""This is not unusual for us, except that maybe it is early on in the season. We have experience with it. There was advance information coming in regard of the intensity of the storm and what to expect."" In Minnesota, though tempered by years of long brutal winters, this snap came a little too soon. ""This is the first snow I've seen this season, and it's a major snowstorm, rather than the usual light dusting you'd expect to start off the winter with,"" said Katie Robinson of St. Paul. ""I think that's the biggest thing -- that we went from a very warm and mild fall to now being thrust so abruptly into winter."" In Montana, temperatures plummeted as bitterly cold winds rushed down the front range of the Rocky Mountains. In Billings, Wednesday will bring overnight lows below zero and daytime highs in the single digits. With overnight temperatures plunging close to record lows, downtown Billings, the heart of Montana's largest city, was empty. Those who did venture out in the cold said they were ready. ""We just watched the alerts, and when they say it's going to be cold, we just bundle up,"" resident Tessa Rogers said. The cold snap will bring lows in the teens and single digits into Iowa, Kansas and Colorado this week but also spread freezing temperatures as far south as Texas. A hard freeze warning extends to just north of the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The frosty blast will move across the rest of the United States, but it will not be as harsh as in the Midwest. Atlanta and Birmingham, Alabama, are expecting daytime high temperatures in the mid-40s on Friday, according to the National Weather Service. A normal high this time of year is 64. Residents in the northern United States can thank Super Typhoon Nuri for the mess. It is the strongest post-tropical cyclone on record in the North Pacific, the National Weather Service said. The storm system plowed into all that arctic cold air in Alaska and northern Canada, forcing it south. Things will get warmer over the weekend, but it won't stay that way, forecasters say. Another arctic blast is on the way for next week. CNN's Gary Tuchman contributed to this report.","By the weekend, the eastern two-thirds of the nation will be affected .

"A nurse has died of Ebola in the Malian capital of Bamako, the health ministry said Wednesday, sparking fears that the nation has not yet defeated the deadly virus. This is the second confirmed Ebola fatality in the West African country. The first victim, a 2-year-old girl, died last month after she traveled to Mali with her grandmother from Guinea -- one of three countries hardest hit by the outbreak in the region. The clinic where the nurse died has been quarantined, and the government  has urged citizens to report suspected cases. The first case prompted fears that the virus was spreading beyond Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea -- the three nations which have seen the most cases of Ebola. Shortly after the toddler was diagnosed, dozens of people who came into contact with her were quarantined, including medical workers. It's unclear whether the nurse was among those who were in contact with the child. The virus has killed at least 4,960 people and infected more than 13,000, mostly in the three nations, according to the World Health Organization. There is currently no cure or vaccine for Ebola. As the world reels from the outbreak, scores of companies are fast-tracking tests for various vaccines, and hope to have millions of experimental doses by next year. Scientists racing to stop the epidemic are trying various experimental drugs on patients, including ZMapp and TKM-Ebola. Health care workers in affected nations will get the first opportunity to try the experimental vaccines, the WHO said. Ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.","This is the second confirmed death from Ebola in Mali, the health ministry says .

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia has asked florists and gift shops to remove all red items until after Valentine's Day, calling the celebration of such a holiday a sin, local media reported Monday. With a ban on red gift items over Valentine's Day in Saudi Arabia, a black market in red roses has flowered. ""As Muslims we shouldn't celebrate a non-Muslim celebration, especially this one that encourages immoral relations between unmarried men and women, "" Sheikh Khaled Al-Dossari, a scholar in Islamic studies, told the Saudi Gazette, an English-language newspaper. Every year, officials with the conservative Muslim kingdom's Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice clamp down on shops a few days before February 14, instructing them to remove red roses, red wrapping paper, gift boxes and teddy bears. On the eve of the holiday, they raid stores and seize symbols of love. The virtue and vice squad is a police force of several thousand charged with, among other things, enforcing dress codes and segregating the sexes. Saudi Arabia, which follows a strict interpretation of Islam called Wahhabism, punishes unrelated women and men who mingle in public. Ahmed Al-Omran, a university student in Riyadh, told CNN that the government decision will give the international media another reason to make fun of the Saudis ""but I think that we got used to that by now."" ""I think what they are doing is ridiculous,"" said Al-Omran, who maintains the blog 'Saudi Jeans.' ""What the conservatives in this country need to learn is something called 'tolerance.' If they don't see the permissibility of celebrating such an occasion, then fine -- they should not celebrate it. But they have to know they have no right to impose their point of view on others."" Because of the ban on red roses, a black market has flowered ahead of Valentine's Day. Roses that normally go for five Saudi riyal ($1.30) fetch up to 30 riyal ($8) on February 14, the Saudi Gazette said. ""Sometimes we deliver the bouquets in the middle of the night or early morning, to avoid suspicion,"" one florist told the paper. Saudi Arabia has often come under criticism for its treatment of women, most recently in a United Nations report that blasted the kingdom for widespread discrimination. Under Saudi law, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man's permission to travel or have surgery. A businesswoman told the Times of London this month that she was detained and strip-searched by the religious police for holding a meeting in a coffee shop with male colleagues. Two years ago, a teenager was raped by seven men who found her alone with a man unrelated to her. The government sentenced the 19-year-old woman to 200 lashes and six months in prison for being in the company of a man who wasn't a family member or her husband. She was later pardoned. The seven rapists were sentenced to two to nine years in prison. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Microsoft Corp. on Monday unveiled its answer to the Nintendo Wii. In a promotional Microsoft video, a woman steers a race car while playing a controller-free Xbox gaming system. The software maker said it will release technology that lets people play video games by moving their bodies instead of clicking hand-held controllers. The service is tentatively called ""Project Natal"" (pronounced nuh-TALL), and will work with any of the company's Xbox 360 consoles, Microsoft said. ""Before, there was a barrier separating video-game players from everyone else,"" said Don Mattrick, senior vice president for Interactive Entertainment Business at Microsoft. ""Now, with Natal, everyone can join in using the best controller ever invented: you."" Microsoft demonstrated Natal before an audience ahead of E3, a video game and entertainment conference that officially begins Tuesday in Los Angeles, California. The show comes at a time of transition for the video game industry, which once was seen as immune to the economic recession but has been showing signs of slowing. Traditional games face new competition from developers who engineer video games for phones and distribute them for free online. Microsoft's Natal doesn't use any controllers, instead it relies on a camera to capture players' movements in a 3-dimensional space. The company says that makes the system more intuitive and appealing to the masses. The system also recognizes faces, which lets it log players into games automatically. It can identify voices and take commands, as well. During the demonstration, players swung their legs to kick soccer balls and threw their hands in the air to try to block goals. In a driving game, players put their hands on an imaginary wheel which they turned to steer cars on their television screens. In a painting game, a man said the name of colors -- ""blue"" or ""light brown"" -- before swinging his arms to splash paint on a digital canvas. No launch date was announced for Natal, and its price tag wasn't discussed. The announcement also comes as Sony and Microsoft are keen to capture the general audiences that are attracted to Nintendo's user-friendly Wii console. Microsoft has been seen as a company that caters to more hard-core gamers. Hollywood director Steven Spielberg was on hand for the event and said Natal will help reach new audiences who may be daunted by complicated joysticks and controllers. ""The vast majority of people are just too intimidated to pick up a game controller,"" he said. ""Despite the size of the industry, still 60 percent of households do not own a video game console."" The company said the no-controller format will revolutionize the gaming experience. Microsoft also said its facial-recognition software will let video-game characters communicate with players by identifying the emotions on their faces. Microsoft also is trying to make gaming a more social experience. The company announced partnerships with the social-networking sites Facebook and Twitter that will allow Xbox LIVE players to post messages about their gaming experiences and send screen shots to their friends in real-time. Both of those services will be available in the fall, the company said. The company also announced several new Xbox 360 games, many of them sequels to big-name franchises like ""Final Fantasy,"" ""Modern Warfare"" and ""Halo."" The company also unveiled ""The Beatles: Rock Band,"" the newest game in the Xbox Rock Band series, which will be available in September. The two surviving Beatles, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, were on stage for the announcement at the star-studded event. Yoko Ono, widow of Beatle John Lennon, as well as Dhani Harrison, son of George Harrison, also were in attendance. Pro skateboarder Tony Hawk also was on hand to debut a skateboard-shaped controller that will power a new skating video game called ""Tony Hawk Ride."" ""It looks similar to a skateboard. It's a little bit shorter, but this thing is full of technology ... It knows where your feet are; it knows where your hands are; you can actually go in for grabs,"" Hawk said, holding a control skateboard without wheels. E3, which stands for the Electronic Entertainment Expo, officially kicks off on Tuesday. Announcements are scheduled from Nintendo, Sony, Electronic Arts and other major players in the video game industry. CNN's John D. Sutter contributed to this report .","Microsoft unveils future video gaming system that doesn't use controllers .

"(CNN) -- Sen. Larry Craig said he ""overreacted and made a poor decision"" in pleading guilty to disorderly conduct after his June arrest following an incident in a Minneapolis, Minnesota, airport bathroom. A police mug shot of Sen. Larry Craig after he was arrested at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport in June. Tuesday, in his first public statement on the arrest, the Idaho Republican said he did nothing ""inappropriate."" ""Let me be clear: I am not gay and never have been,"" said Craig, who has aligned himself with conservative groups who oppose gay rights. With his wife by his side, Craig said he is the victim of a ""witch hunt"" conducted by the Idaho Statesman newspaper. ""In pleading guilty, I overreacted in Minneapolis, because of the stress of the Idaho Statesman's investigation and the rumors it has fueled around Idaho,"" he said. ""Again, that overreaction was a mistake, and I apologize for my misjudgment.""  Watch Craig say he did nothing wrong » . He added: ""I should not have kept this arrest to myself, and should have told my family and friends about it. I wasn't eager to share this failure, but I should have done so anyway."" A police officer who arrested him June 11 said Craig peered through a crack in a restroom stall door for two minutes and made gestures suggesting to the officer he wanted to engage in ""lewd conduct."" Craig's blue eyes were clearly visible through the crack in the door, Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport police Sgt. Dave Karsnia wrote in the report he filed. ""Craig would look down at his hands, 'fidget' with his fingers, and then look through the crack into my stall again,"" Karsnia wrote in documents accompanying the arrest report. Craig said the officer misinterpreted his actions. After he was taken for questioning, the police report says, Craig pulled out a Senate business card and asked the officer: ""What do you think of that?"" Before the senator spoke in Boise, Idaho, Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, informed Craig the leaders of his own party were calling for an ethics investigation into what they termed a ""serious matter,"" a Senate Republican leadership aide told CNN. The aide said senators, who discussed the matter by phone, were especially concerned about the business card allegation. The GOP leadership consists of McConnell, Assistant Minority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, Conference Chairman Jon Kyl of Arizona, Policy Committee Chair Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, and Senatorial Committee Chair John Ensign of Nevada. ""Due to the reported and disputed circumstances, and the legal resolution of this serious case, we will recommend that Senator Craig's incident be reported to the Senate Ethics Committee for its review,"" the group said in a statement. ""In the meantime, Leadership is examining other aspects of the case to determine if additional action is required,"" the statement said. Craig, 62, pleaded guilty August 8 to a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge in the incident, according to Minnesota criminal records. The senator said he ""chose to plead guilty to a lesser charge in the hope of making it go away. I did not seek any counsel, either from an attorney, staff, friends, or family. That was a mistake, and I deeply regret it."" On Tuesday, Craig announced that he has retained an attorney. The officer wrote he was on a plainclothes detail in the restroom because of citizen complaints and arrests for sexual activity there. Karsnia wrote that when the person occupying the stall beside him left, Craig entered it and blocked the door with his rolling suitcase. ""My experience has shown that individuals engaging in lewd conduct use their bags to block the view from the front of their stall,"" the officer said in his report. The senator then tapped his right foot, ""a signal used by persons wishing to engage in lewd conduct,"" Karsnia wrote, and Craig ran his left hand several times underneath the partition dividing the stalls. ""The presence of others did not seem to deter Craig as he moved his right foot so that it touched the side of my left foot, which was within my stall area,"" the officer's report said. When the police interviewed him later, the senator said that ""he has a wide stance when going to the bathroom"" and that was why his foot may have touched the officer's, the report said. Craig also told police that he had reached down to the floor to pick up a piece of paper, the officer wrote. ""It should be noted that there was not a piece of paper on the bathroom floor, nor did Craig pick up a piece of paper,"" Karsnia wrote. ""During the interview, Craig either disagreed with me or 'didn't recall' the events as they happened."" After Craig ran his hand underneath the partition wall three times, Karsnia held his police identification down by the floor so the senator could see it, the report said. ""With my left hand near the floor, I pointed towards the exit. Craig responded, 'No!' ""I again pointed towards the exit. Craig exited the stall with his roller bags without flushing the toilet,"" Karsnia wrote. The senator initially resisted the officer's request to go to the police operations center, he said, but finally did. There, he was read his Miranda rights, interviewed, photographed, fingerprinted and released, the report said. The Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call first reported the arrest Monday. In a statement released Monday evening, Craig denied inappropriate conduct and said he regrets his guilty plea, which he entered without having an attorney present. ""At the time of this incident, I complained to the police that they were misconstruing my actions. I was not involved in any inappropriate conduct,"" he said. ""I should have had the advice of counsel in resolving this matter. In hindsight, I should not have pled guilty. I was trying to handle this matter myself quickly and expeditiously."" Craig paid a $500 fine when he entered his guilty plea in Hennepin County Municipal Court in Bloomington, Minnesota, according to state criminal records. In his petition to enter a guilty plea, Craig acknowledged that he ""engaged in (physical) conduct which I knew or should have known tended to arouse alarm or resentment."" He also was required to stipulate in the statement that he would ""make no claim that I am innocent of the charge to which I am entering a plea of guilty,"" the document said. On Tuesday, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a complaint with the Senate Ethics Committee, asking that the senator's conduct be investigated. The group, which largely targets Republicans, asked the committee to probe whether Craig ""violated the Senate Rules of Conduct by engaging in disorderly conduct,"" a statement said. ""If pleading guilty to charges stemming from an attempt to solicit an undercover officer in a public restroom is not conduct that reflects poorly upon the Senate, what is?"" asked Melanie Sloan, the group's executive director, in a statement. Sloan is a former U.S. attorney in the Clinton administration's Justice Department. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, chairwoman of the Ethics Committee, declined to comment on whether an investigation would be conducted. Her office noted the committee's work is generally confidential. A Senate aide familiar with Ethics Committee practices said ethics rules do not specifically require a member to disclose pleading guilty to a misdemeanor. But the rules require the panel to look into a matter and determine whether an investigation is appropriate once a formal complaint is lodged. Craig resigned Monday night as a Senate liaison for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. Romney's son Josh canceled a trip to Idaho on Tuesday. Craig, Idaho's senior senator, is married with three grown children and nine grandchildren. A former rancher, he was first elected to the Senate in 1990 after serving a decade in the House of Representatives. His seat is up for re-election in 2008. Last fall, Craig's office publicly denied assertions by Internet blogger Mike Rogers that the senator is gay. Craig's office dismissed speculation about the senator's sexuality as ""completely ridiculous."" In 1982, Craig denied rumors he was under investigation as part of a federal probe into allegations that lawmakers on Capitol Hill had sexual relationships with congressional pages, saying the ""false allegations"" made him ""mad as hell."" He was never implicated in that investigation, which led to ethics charges against two other congressmen. In recent years, Craig's voting record has earned him top ratings from social conservative groups such as the American Family Association, Concerned Women for America and the Family Research Council. He has supported a federal constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, telling his colleagues that it was ""important for us to stand up now and protect traditional marriage, which is under attack by a few unelected judges and litigious activists."" In 1996, Craig also voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal recognition to same-sex marriages and prevents states from being forced to recognize the marriages of gay and lesbian couples legally performed in other states. Craig also has opposed expanding the federal hate crimes law to cover offenses motivated by anti-gay bias and, in 1996, voted against a bill that would have outlawed employment discrimination based on sexual orientation, which failed by a single vote in the Senate.

"Atlanta (CNN)Even a zombie apocalypse has a silver lining. At least in Georgia. Fans of the wildly popular AMC series ""The Walking Dead"" are making their way to Atlanta and surrounding small-town Georgia to sniff out traces of Rick Grimes' crew of survivors and the voracious zombies on their trail. On one recent Sunday, two ""Big Zombie"" bus tours drew mostly out-of-state visitors with fans from Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Washington and places across the Southeast, plus a fan from Brazil on a monthlong American odyssey. Many planned their trips especially to see ""The Walking Dead"" locations up close. Mary Kolodziej and her husband, Eric, flew into Atlanta from Indianapolis for a zombie-centered getaway. The couple have been fans of the show, now in its fifth season, since Day One and have attended Comic Con in Chicago more than once to meet the cast. ""Everybody's always like, 'What if, what if something happens? I don't know what I would do.' Well, the show kind of shows you what people would do,"" said Kolodziej, 48, while waiting to start her second zombie tour of the weekend. ""Everybody can relate to somebody on this show."" Identifying with the lurching, rasping ""walkers"" is a taller order, but guides on the ""Big Zombie"" tours help. They've worked as zombie extras on the show. Tour guide Patrick Williams, 42, has appeared as both zombie and human since he attended ""Zombie School"" (auditions) right before season two, but he's still waiting for a shot at prosthetic facial gashes and deformities and the painful, vision-obscuring contact lenses worn by ""featured hero zombies."" ""'Featured zombie' is the term they use for the zombies that have all the prosthetics and the camera is right up on them, and they usually have some interaction with the cast or they're gnawing on somebody,"" Williams said. Big business . Flesh-eating walkers are far from the only Hollywood types roaming Georgia. A 2008 tax credit of up to 30% for productions of $500,000 or more has spawned hordes of film crews. ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" and the franchise's third installment, the two-part ""Mockingjay"" sequel, were all filmed in and around Atlanta. More than 150 film and TV productions were shot in Georgia in fiscal year 2014 alone, according to the Georgia film office. Last year, the state launched ComeTourGeorgia.com, aimed at entertainment fans. Since 2010, about a dozen film and television studios have announced plans to locate or expand in Georgia. UK-based Pinewood Studios recently opened a new facility, where Marvel's ""Ant-Man"" has started filming, and Atlanta mogul Tyler Perry is hoping to develop studio space at the shuttered Army base Fort McPherson. The rush of movie and TV projects builds on a longstanding state interest in the benefits of film production, a focus sparked by the 1972 film ""Deliverance."" But fans of present-day hits are more likely to recognize the wilds of post-apocalyptic Atlanta and ""The Walking Dead's"" fictional Woodbury than the whitewater rapids of northeast Georgia. The ""Big Zombie"" tours ($65) are operated by Atlanta Movie Tours, which launched in 2012 with a single ""Walking Dead""-themed tour. The company now hosts two zombie tours and two other film-related tours and recently welcomed guest No. 10,000. So far, almost all of the company's business is zombie-related, according to co-owner Patti Davis. TV and movie clips are played on the tour bus for film-to-real-life comparisons. The company is headquartered in a historic and recently revitalized downtown warehouse district called Castleberry Hill. The neighborhood is an easy walk from Centennial Olympic Park and within blocks of much of the Atlanta-based action in season one of ""The Walking Dead."" Just down the street from the tour office is the Nelson Street Bridge, where Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) rode on horseback over a tangle of railroad tracks to seek refuge in Atlanta in the first season. Directly across the bridge is the unoccupied Norfolk Southern Building, which was the scene of much rooftop debate and some hand-wrenching decision-making after Rick arrived on the scene. The famous tank scene was filmed a few blocks north, near the corner of Forsyth and Walton streets. Season one's downtown scenery is easily walkable for visitors just looking for a taste, but a bus tour is a convenient option when fans start looking to sites south, west and north of downtown. By bus, visitors can see the recent Terminus location (near the corner of Windsor and Doane streets), the hospital where Rick wakes up to the apocalypse (Atlanta Mission offices on Bolton Road) and the CDC stand-in (Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre). For do-it-yourselfers, your own wheels, a GPS and a good combing of the Internet for location addresses are essential. Points south and star sightings . ""The Walking Dead"" action moved out of Atlanta to rural settings in season two. The second installment of the ""Big Zombie"" tours starts about 35 miles south of Atlanta in Senoia, the show's fictional Woodbury. The quaint little town is doing big zombie business. Check-in for tours is centered at the Woodbury Shoppe, a recently relocated and expanded ""Walking Dead"" emporium packed with T-shirts, messenger bags, calendars, belts and more. Flattened penny souvenirs saying ""I (heart) Daryl"" sell for four quarters (plus the penny). Location guides for seasons one through four are available for $25, or visitors can book more pinpointed Coweta Film Tours at the shop for about $15. The Waking Dead Cafe just opened on the lower level adjacent to a display of prison cells and other props from the show. The second ""Big Zombie"" tour takes visitors to a handful of Coweta County locations, including the Zombie Arena (Caldwell Tanks facility in Newnan), the sleepy town of Grantville, where season three's ""Clear"" episode was shot, and to the barn and abandoned feed mill in Haralson, where Rick meets the Governor for the first time and later, where Merle and the Governor face off. Sadly for fans, the farmhouse that stars in season two is off-limits. Its occupants apparently regret their house's role in the show and do not welcome visitors. The prison is also missing from the tour, as it was built at Raleigh Studios and has since been dismantled. Still, lucky fans might see more than ""Walking Dead"" sets. Before the recent tour, some fans spotted Maggie (Lauren Cohan) at the new coffee shop in the Woodbury Shoppe. Filming is scheduled to go on right outside Senoia's town center until mid-November. And back in Atlanta, there's at least one classic institution that boasts more than its fair share of celebrity sightings. Jennifer Lawrence, Woody Harrelson, Morgan Freeman, Robert De Niro, Bill Murray, Jack Black and Jon Hamm have all been spotted at the gritty yet beloved Clermont Lounge. ""The Walking Dead"" character Glenn, played by Steven Yeun, recommended the Clermont to Conan O'Brien during a 2013 appearance on his show, describing it as a ""really fun, divey place"" with ""an open stripping area"" with ""mostly older, beautiful ladies."" While you're in town, live a little.","Fans of ""The Walking Dead"" are making their way to Georgia .

"A gang wielding knives and axes attacked civilians, a police station, government offices and smashed vehicles in a restive region of China, the country's state-run Xinhua news agency reported Tuesday, citing local police. The incident -- called an ""organized and premeditated"" terror attack -- occurred Monday in northwestern China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Police officers at the scene shot dead dozens of people in the mob. Thirty-one cars were vandalized, including six that were set ablaze. It was not immediately known how many people were killed and injured. The location, Shache County, is where nine people authorities describe as terrorists attacked a police station, hurled explosives and torched police cars in December. Police shot and killed eight people in that attack. There have been other attacks in the region in recent months. Twenty-nine people were killed and 130 injured when men armed with long knives stormed a train station in Kunming in March. The next month, an attack on a train station in Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital, left three dead, including the attackers, and an attack on an Urumqi market in May killed at least 39 people. There have been longstanding tensions between Uyghur Muslims, a Turkic people, and Chinese Han people in Xinjiang.

"(CNN)The U.S. Navy says its new laser weapon works and it will use it if it has to. The Office of Naval Research reported Wednesday that its laser weapons system -- dubbed LaWS -- had performed flawlessly in tests aboard the amphibious transport dock USS Ponce in the Arabian Gulf from September to November. ""Laser weapons are powerful, affordable and will play a vital role in the future of naval combat operations,"" Rear Adm. Matthew L. Klunder, chief of naval research, said in a statement. ""We ran this particular weapon, a prototype, through some extremely tough paces, and it locked on and destroyed the targets we designated with near-instantaneous lethality."" Klunder said the laser performed so well that the commander of the Ponce is now authorized to use it in defense of the vessel, according to a report from the U.S. Naval Institute. ""The captain of that ship has all of the authorities necessary if there was a threat inbound to that ship to protect our sailors and Marines (and) we would defend that ship with that laser system,"" Klunder is quoted as saying in a USNI report. The laser could be used to stop threats ranging from drones and helicopters to small patrol boats, Klunder said, according to the USNI report. Navy video released Wednesday shows the LaWS hitting exactly those types of targets. Watching the video, you can't see any light beam as you might expect from watching science fiction movies. Instead, the targets just burn up. The Navy says the laser weapon is safer than conventional arms that use propellants and explosive warheads, and more cost-effective. ""At less than a dollar per shot, there's no question about the value LaWS provides,"" Klunder said in the Navy statement. ""With affordability a serious concern for our defense budgets, this will more effectively manage resources to ensure our sailors and Marines are never in a fair fight."" The laser also takes fewer crew members to operate. It can be fired by one sailor using a video game-like controller. The weapon performed without failure in conditions of high wind, humidity and temperature, the Navy said. The Navy hopes to deploy variations of the laser weapon system in the fleet by 2020.","Navy's laser tested off ship in Persian Gulf from September to November .

"Nearly 100 people, most of them ""terrorists,"" were killed in an attack last week in China, state media reported Sunday. A total of 37 civilians were killed, and police ""gunned down 59 terrorists,"" Xinhua reported, bringing the death toll to 96. A gang wielding knives and axes attacked civilians, a police station and government offices and smashed vehicles in a restive region, according to Xinhua. Cars were vandalized, and some were set ablaze. The ""organized and premeditated"" attack took place Monday in the northwestern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. There have been numerous attacks in the region, where tensions are simmering between Uyghur Muslims, a Turkic people, and Chinese Han people. A Muslim separatist group founded by militant Uyghurs has been blamed for terrorism in the region, the Council on Foreign Relations explains. Xinhua said the ""mastermind"" behind the attack Monday ""had close connections with the terrorist organization,"" known as the East Turkestan Islamic Movement. In May, China launched a terrorism crackdown after a series of explosions in an open-air market killed dozens in Xinjiang.  Many of the victims were elderly people, Xinhua reported. ""This is a despicable and outrageous act of violence against innocent civilians, and the United States resolutely opposes all forms of terrorism,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said at the time . Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment toward China's Han majority in recent years over what they say is harsh treatment from Chinese security forces and Han people taking the lion's share of economic opportunities in Xinjiang.

"As Missouri governor, Jay Nixon believes the most important part of his job is keeping the people of his state safe. To that end, he told reporters Tuesday that he's working ""around the clock"" ahead of the grand jury decision in the case of Michael Brown. Brown, a black teen, was fatally shot by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, on August 9. The jury is weighing whether to indict Wilson. Mayor anticipates protests in region where grand jury decides . ""In the days immediately following Michael Brown's death, peaceful protests were marred by senseless acts of violence and destruction,"" the governor said. ""That ugliness was not representative of Missouri and it cannot be repeated,"" said Nixon. Many protesters were furious because they felt Brown's killing was an example of excessive use of force. They and heavily armed law enforcement clashed in the streets for days after Brown's death. Brown's parents address U.N. Authorities, who drove armored vehicles and wore military gear, were roundly criticized by members of the media, other law enforcement officials and demonstrators for escalating the violence, rather than tempering it. Though the grand jury has until January to issue its ruling on Wilson, the prosecutor's office has said a decision could come as early as mid-November. Ferguson Mayor James Knowles has previously told local media that authorities must ""prepare for the worst"" and that he expects demonstrations across the area. Brown's father said that he, too, foresees protests. ""We understand that our son is gone, but the movement will be that -- we're trying to make sure that this doesn't happen to anyone else,"" Michael Brown Sr. told CNN. Nixon made clear he's not anticipating violence, but wants to be ready for anything. Police from various departments will operate as a unified command. The National Guard will be available as necessary. Law enforcement is prepared to extend shifts and limit leave, and additional resources have been distributed, Nixon said. ""These measures are not being taken because we are convinced that violence will occur, but because we have a responsibility to prepare for any contingency,"" said the governor. ""This is America. People have a right to express their views and grievances, but they do not have the right to put their fellow citizens or their property at risk,"" he said.

"As the surviving Boston bombing suspect lay in a prison hospital bed, investigators 90 miles away spent Friday combing a dump for his laptop and other clues that could shed light on the young men purportedly behind the bloody attack, a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation said. Information from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev himself spurred authorities to look through the New Bedford, Massachusetts, landfill, the official told CNN's Susan Candiotti. Others who may have knowledge of the computer's whereabouts or may have played a role in disposing of it also provided leads that led to the search, according to a U.S. law enforcement official close to the Boston investigation. The 19-year-old Tsarnaev went to school -- at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth -- in town adjacent to New Bedford, and he was spotted in his dorm room there in the days after the April 15 twin blasts that left three dead. Tsarnaev has not given investigators any substantive information since officials informed him of his constitutional rights prior to charging him with use of and conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, the source said Friday. But the the source described the earlier bedside questioning -- which took place in two rounds during parts of Saturday, Sunday and Monday, New York police Commissioner Ray Kelly had said -- as ""very thorough"" and said investigators do not feel hamstrung. These first interviews took place at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had been held since his capture a week ago. Latest developments in the Boston bombings probe . Beth Israel is one of several hospitals that treated the more than 260 people injured in the Boston Marathon attack allegedly pulled off by Dzhokhar and his older brother Tamerlan. Some 30 of them remained hospitalized late Friday afternoon, including one in critical condition, according to a CNN tally. In recent days, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has improved enough that he'd been able to sit and was writing, a law enforcement official said. At 3:30 a.m., the official said, he was transferred from Beth Israel to Federal Medical Center Devens some 40 miles away. The federal Bureau of Prisons hospital, located on the grounds of the former Fort Devens U.S. military base, is designed for patients requiring ongoing medical care, according to the facility's website. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had what appeared to be gunshot wounds to his head, neck, legs and hand when he was captured April 19 after a nearly 24-hour manhunt, according to the criminal complaint accusing him in the marathon blasts. His 26-year-old brother died after a gunfight hours earlier. Photos: Galleries from the attack and aftermath . Despite vow, suspects' father still in Russia . The suspects' parents, meanwhile, are in Russia. Their mother Zubeidat Tsarnaev told CNN on Friday that she and her husband had left their home in Dagestan for another part of Russia. The brothers' father, Anzor Tsarnaev, had said he'd planned to travel to the United States. But that trip has been delayed indefinitely for health reasons,  Zubeidat Tsarnaev told CNN's Nick Paton Walsh. She wouldn't elaborate. The mother will not be flying to the United States, where she is wanted on felony charges of shoplifting and destruction of property. The family lived in Massachusetts before Zubeidat Tsarnaev jumped bail after her arrest on the charges in 2012. The parents moved to Dagestan, a semiautonomous republic in southern Russia that year. Russian authorities raised concerns in 2011 to U.S. authorities about Zubeidat and her son Tamerlan, sources told CNN. They asked both the FBI and CIA, separately, about Tamerlan, source said. But a U.S. official said that the Russian's case at the time was ""thin,"" though U.S. authorities did add both their names to the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, database -- which includes over a half million names -- an intelligence official said. Even so, U.S. authorities have come under fire at home, with lawmakers asking if the FBI and CIA failed to share information. In an interview with CNN on Thursday, Zubeidat Tsarnaev said she didn't want to accept the reality of the bombing, saying it was fake. She said she has seen a video pushing the wild idea, and that there was no blood, that paint was used instead. Suspects' mother describes her last conversation with her sons . Nonetheless, she broke down when she spoke of the victims. ""I really feel sorry for all of them. Really feel sorry for all of them,"" she said, her voice cracking even as she remained resolute that her sons were not involved. Official: U.S. wars in Afghanistan, Iraq motivated bombings . Putin regrets Russia couldn't give U.S. more info . While insisting Russian and U.S. authorities often work together, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said that -- though authorities in Washington were tipped off, to some extent -- he wished they could have done something more that might have prevented the Boston attack. ""The Russian (authorities), to my great regret, were not able to provide our American colleagues with information that would have operative significance,"" Putin said. Dead Boston bomb suspect posted video of jihadist, analysis shows . In his first on-camera comments since the bombing, the Russian leader added he hoped that the bombings might spur more cooperation between the two nations. ""If we combine our efforts, we will not suffer blows like that,"" he said during a live televised call-in session in Moscow on Thursday. Putin also lashed out against those in the West who have slammed Russia for human rights abuses in its actions toward Chechnya. ""Russia is among the first victims, and I hate it when our Western partners call our terrorists who committed some heinous crimes in Russia ... freedom fighters... They supported them,"" said Putin, accusing unnamed people or groups of providing Russia's foes with political, financial and ""media"" support. Report: Carjacked man describes wild ordeal . Based on investigative leads and information provided by Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, investigators believe that each of the brothers had their own remote control device to detonate bombs near the marathon's finish line, said a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation on Friday. The previous day, a law enforcement official said at least one of the bombs that exploded was set off by remote control. Tragedy in Boston: How to help . Three days after that attack, and hours after authorities released images of two suspects, they ""spontaneously"" decided to go to New York's Times Square to blow up their six remaining explosives, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told investigators. But a botched carjacking spoiled the impromptu road trip, said Tsarnaev, whose account was outlined Thursday by New York's police commissioner. ""We don't know that we would have been able to stop the terrorists had they arrived here from Boston,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. ""We're just thankful that we didn't have to find out that answer."" Before forcing their way into the vehicle the night of April 18, the brothers shot dead a campus police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, police said. The hijacked vehicle, a Mercedes SUV, ran low on fuel and they stopped at a service station, where the vehicle's owner escaped.  Shortly thereafter, police picked up the trail of the SUV. A pursuit followed, during which, authorities say, the men were throwing the bombs out the vehicle's window at them. The gun battle and Tamerlan Tsarnaev's death followed. In a Boston Globe story, the man who was carjacked -- a 26-year-old Chinese entrepreneur identified only as Danny -- described his 90-minute ordeal, from when a man brandishing a silver handgun got into his Mercedes to when he ran for his life into a Mobil gas station's supply room. During this time, Danny told the Globe, the gun-wielding man confessed to pulling off the Boston bombing and to killing a police officer in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where MIT's campus is located. Together they crisscrossed around the Boston area, at one point stopping for gas and another time so that another person could join them in the car. Danny recognized both men from the photos released by the FBI earlier on April 18, men who authorities now say were Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The carjackers openly discussed traveling to New York, before Danny was able to run to safety. ""He fell down, screaming, 'Please, please call ... the police. They want to kill me. They have a gun, they have a bomb,''"" Tarek Ahmed, the clerk working in the gas station at the time, told CNN's Piers Morgan. Danny first hid at the front counter, then went to a storage room. Ahmed, after first making sure this man wasn't one of the bombing suspects and separately thinking he might be drunk, quickly picked up a phone and called 911. ""I was waiting (for) someone to shoot me at this moment,"" Ahmed said, adding he couldn't see outside from where he called. ""I was waiting to die ... I wanted to finish my call very fast with the police."" Within five minutes, the gas station was teeming with police. And a short time later, after a chase in which the suspects allegedly shot at police and threw bombs out their windows, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was dead. His brother was captured about 20 hours later. James Alan Fox -- a criminology professor at Northeastern University, where Danny had been a student, and who has spent considerable time with him over recent days -- told CNN that the carjacking victim ""doesn't like to see himself as a hero."" ""After all, he says, 'I was only trying to save myself,'"" Fox said. ""But ... his actions, his composure, his smarts were what led this case to a close and may have indeed saved thousands of Americans if we believe, in fact, that (the Boston suspects) had plans to do more bombings in New York City.""

"What happens when a rock 'n' roll legend promotes a music player in a world where the iPod, and its smartphone cousins, already dominate the market? If that legend is Neil Young and the music player promises higher-quality sound than any of its competitors, it becomes the third-biggest Kickstarter campaign in the history of the site. The crowdfunding campaign for Young's Pono Music closed Tuesday, having raised more than $6.2 million. The campaign's goal of $800,000 was blown away less than 24 hours after it launched in March. Young, a longtime critic of what he calls the ""underwater listening"" experience of compressed digital music, thanked backers on the campaign's homepage Tuesday. ""You have helped to set the stage for a revolution in music listening,"" Young wrote. ""Finally, quality enters the listening space so that we can all hear and feel what the artists created, the way they heard and felt it."" The idea behind Pono is to boost digital music from the compressed and lossy formats to high-quality resolution. Pono will stream music in 24-bit, 192-kHz sound, brighter and more present than the sound provided by MP3s or even CDs. Pono will include both an online music store and player. The PonoPlayer, which will come with 128GB of storage, will sell for $399. By comparison, the 64GB iPod touch sells for the same price, and the iPod classic, with 160GB of storage, sells for $249. High-resolution digital albums at Ponomusic.com are expected to cost between $15 and $25. The site says all major record labels are on board and beginning to expand the amount of their music that's recorded in high-quality digital formats. Young, who introduced the system at the South by Southwest music festival in March with endorsements from the likes of Tom Petty, Eddie Vedder and Sting, believes that the quality of the listening experience will draw enough fans willing to pay more. ""It's been a long time coming. It was not easy getting this far, but you made it happen by supporting Pono's vision for better listening,"" he wrote. ""Pono wants to preserve the history of music, in all of its beauty and expression, for all time. Forever.""","Neil Young's Pono Music raises $6.2 million on Kickstarter .

"Cars park side by side in a vacant lot in the center of Kuta, Bali, near a sign that implores passersby not to urinate there. It was here 10 years ago that a bomb tore through the Sari Club, for a split second silencing the crowd of revelers as they chatted, drank and danced on a typical Saturday night out. Phil Britten was there with his team mates from the Kingsley Cats, Australian rules football players on an end of season trip from Perth, on the country's west coast. In his book ""Undefeated,"" Britten, who received burns to 60% of his body, describes the stench and burning in his throat from the bomb, before his hearing kicked in and the screams rang out. ""It started really softly, a moaning or whimpering, then grew louder and louder. It was piercing. It sounded unnatural, as if it was part of a horror movie, and it was terrifying,"" he wrote. Britten is back in Bali this week for memorial events to mark the 10-year anniversary of the bombing. He's one of thousands of victims, family members, government officials and dignitaries in Kuta to pay their respects to those killed in what has been described as Indonesia's worst ever act of terrorism. On the night of October 12, 2002, just past 11 p.m. local time, a bomb went off inside Paddy's Bar, sending clubbers out into the street and into the path of a massive car bomb outside the Sari Club. A third, smaller bomb was detonated seconds later outside the U.S. consulate but it caused no injuries. Back on the tourist strip, the air was thick was smoke, flames and chaos as survivors tried to drag themselves and others to safety. Two hundred and two people were killed; 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians, 24 Britons, seven Americans and 30 others from a number of European countries. New Zealand, Brazil, Canada and Japan also lost citizens, as did South Africa, South Korea and Ecuador. The attack was blamed on Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), a South East Asian militant group with links to al Qaeda. Since the attack, Indonesia has tried and executed three perpetrators and killed other key conspirators in police raids. The last man to stand trial over the blasts, Umar Patek, was jailed for 20 years in June for helping to assemble the bombs. Writing in the Sydney Morning Herald on Thursday, Indonesia president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said 10 years on ""we can say with some relief that justice has been done."" The Bali bombings, he wrote, ""set off a series of critical chain reactions. Indonesia developed a highly skilled and dedicated police anti-terror unit. And an international campaign was launched to restore the image of Indonesia as a peaceful tourist destination. Today, tourism in Bali has exceeded pre-attack figures."" One man who won't be in Kuta this week, if ever, is Grant Nicholson, the secretary of the Forbes Rugby Union club. He lost his best friend, Greg Sanderson, in the blast. Sanderson, or ""Sando"" as he was known, was one of 25 Forbes players who were there celebrating the end of the rugby season. Three didn't make it home. ""I can pay my respects to Sando here, I don't need to go to Bali and see what hasn't been done,"" Nicholson said from his home in Forbes, a town of just 8,500 people in rural New South Wales. He was referring to the site where the Sari Club once stood, which is now being used as a car park. ""It's a sacred site,"" he said. ""It's like walking over someone's grave. Two hundred and two people died there... I don't need to go to and see that to be close to Greg. He's here with us."" Campaigners had hoped by now there would be a permanent memorial to those killed in the attack. A monument to the dead now stands where Paddy's Bar used to be, but Britten and other survivors want to see the Bali Peace Park, a place of reflection for those killed, built on the Sari site. ""Initially there were people who planted some banana palms, so there were some things being grown there, which was OK,"" Britten said. ""At least it wasn't being driven over, walked on, urinated on."" Development is said to have been held up in haggling over the price. ""The landowner is asking a ridiculous amount of money -- it's not worth paying that much -- it's just unrealistic. So we've just got to work out what's fair for everybody and come to a win-win,"" Britten said. Until then, survivors, friends and family members of those killed have created their own makeshift shrine. In the past few days, wreaths, flowers and photos of the dead have been laid on the former Sari site. An Australian flag hangs along a fence where someone has pinned photos of all 88 Australians killed, images crudely cut from a newspaper special. Britten was just 22 years old when he was caught in the blast. It was his first time in Bali. ""I flew in, was here for six hours and I got blown up,"" he said. Ten years on, he says with more than a hint of relief, ""I'm in a place mentally and physically that I couldn't have dreamed of."" This is his eighth trip to Bali since the bombings, and another step in his personal journey from terror to a place of strength and peace. ""Just walking down the street I'm bumping into people I've met, or even seen in a paper, and you can just tell, you look at each other in the eyes and you can tell go, 'yep, you've been there, you've done it,'"" he said. ""You have a handshake and a cuddle and a cry and you move on. It's quite surreal; it's like we've known each other, all these people, for so long, but never met."" While some may see the 10 year mark as a time to let go, Britten says, for him, the significance of the date won't fade over time. ""Ten years does mark a significant stepping off point, but for me, 11, 12, 15, 20 years is going to feel exactly the same. When I wake up in the morning and I get changed I don't see anything different each day. I see the scars of the burns that I got. ""For me each year is going to be exactly the same.""","Thousands gather in Kuta, Bali to mark 10 years since terror attacks killed 202 people .

"Julie Uhrman needed $950,000 from Kickstarter in less than a month to make her dream of an affordable, free-to-play gaming console a reality. She got it in eight hours -- and nearly $8 million more after that. ""It was the opposite of 'Field of Dreams,' "" said Uhrman, a gaming-industry veteran and former vice president at IGN. ""It was, if you come, we will build this."" And so was born Ouya, a $99 console that's shaped like and is just a hair bigger than a Rubik's Cube. It runs on Google's Android operating system and requires developers to offer a version of their games for free. Kickstarter backers will be getting their Ouyas later this month and they'll go on sale to everyone else in June. Speaking here at the South by Southwest Interactive festival, Uhrman said she got the idea for Ouya (pronounced OOO-yuh) in response to a video-game industry that to her had grown stale. No new consoles were announced at last year's E3 gaming conference by the big three console makers (Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony). In recent years, almost all the most hyped and popular games have been sequels. And the rise of mobile gaming has been limited, turning video gaming into a solitary exercise rather than the social one she remembered growing up. ""The TV is the best screen for playing games,"" Uhrman said in an interview-style keynote with editor Joshua Topolsky of tech blog The Verge. ""I remember growing up, playing with my sister ... I feel like we've lost that. I want to bring back the world of TV gaming."" For gamers, the strength of a console often boils down to the games they can play on it. To that end, Uhrman said 7,000 developers have signed up for Ouya accounts, from big publishers who create multi-million-selling titles like ""Halo"" down to the smaller independents. The only requirement, she says, is that the game must be free or offer a free trial before the player has to buy it. How the game will make money -- whether it's through ads, in-game purchases or sales after a free trial -- is up to the developer. ""You shouldn't have to pay so much money to try out a new game,"" she said. ""We believe that every single game you should try before you buy."" During the hour-long interview, Topolsky pushed Uhrman on whether the Ouya, which will have 1GB of RAM and run on an Nvidia Tegra 3 chip, will be powerful enough to run the kind of immersive, expansive shooters that have made big gaming releases as lucrative as blockbuster movies. Her answer came in two parts. ""Yes,"" she said. ""And why would we? ""Those experiences are great on those devices. You wouldn't want to play those games anywhere else. But we are going to have exclusive games. ... We're going to have inventive, creative, exciting content that no one else has. At $99, it's not an either-or decision."" Uhrman said some top developers will be reworking popular titles for the Ouya. Others, some of whom have never made games before using Android, are crafting new titles, she said. ""We're going to have our version of those games, but it's going to be different,"" she said. ""We will have a first-person shooter ... game that you are going to want to play for hours on end."" Ouya also has partnered with game-streaming site OnLive, meaning that some graphic-intensive games could be playable on the device via the cloud. Throughout its development, Ouya has been open to its public, inviting them to help make suggestions. When backers pointed out on Reddit that the color-coded buttons on the console's controller were no good for color-blind players, Ouya replaced them, making the four buttons correspond with the O, U, Y and A in its name. An Ethernet port was added when some backers outside the United States said they had no access to Wi-Fi, and a USB port was added for the ""hardest of the hardcore"" players who will want to store more games than the console can handle. Increasingly, gaming consoles are becoming all-in-one entertainment hubs for the living room, and Ouya will try to compete in that arena as well. The company already has partnerships with Flickster and Vevo and is in talks with major players like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and Google. ""We're pretty confident we're going to have (that content) at launch or close to launch,"" Uhrman said. Between now and then, she'll be focusing on two goals. ""We want you to love it,"" she said. ""And we want it to work.""","Ouya is a $99 gaming console that will require all games be offered for free .

"In what has been described as one of the largest cheating scandals to hit the nation's public education system, 35 Atlanta Public Schools educators and administrators were indicted Friday on charges of racketeering and corruption. The indictment is the bookend to a story that was once touted as a model for the nation's school districts after the district's test scores dramatically improved in some of its toughest urban schools. Among those indicted by a Fulton County, Georgia, grand jury was Beverly Hall, the former schools superintendent who gained national recognition in 2009 for turning around Atlanta's school system. ""She was a full participant in that conspiracy,"" Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard told reporters during a news conference announcing the charges. ""Without her, this conspiracy could not have taken place, particularly in the degree in which it took place."" The indictment follows a state investigation that was launched after a series of reports by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper found large, unexplained gains in test scores in some Atlanta schools. A state review determined that some cheating had occurred in more than half of the district's elementary and middle schools. About 180 teachers were initially implicated in the scandal. 2011: Quit or be fired, educators implicated in Atlanta scandal told . Threats and intimidation . Hall has denied any role in the cheating scandal. In 2011, she told The New York Times that her subordinates had allowed the cheating to occur, but denied she was involved. Hall resigned from her position in 2011 following the state investigation, which lambasted her leadership and found widespread cheating in dozens of Atlanta schools. The alleged cheating is believed to date back to early 2001, according to the indictment, when standardized testing scores began to turn around in the 50,000-student school district. For at least a period of four years, between 2005 and 2009, test answers were altered, fabricated and falsely certified, the indictment said. Hall allegedly oversaw a system where threats and intimidation were used against teachers, it said. ""As a result, cheating became more and more prevalent,"" the indictment said. By the time the 2009 Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests, as the standardized test is known, was administered in Atlanta Public Schools, ""cheating was taking place in a majority of APS's 83 elementary and middle schools."" Report: Test cheating may be widespread . The allegations, the indictment said, are substantiated by the Georgia Governor's Office of Student Achievement analysis of erasures on standardized tests. 'Suspicious' test score gains . According to the indictment, Hall placed unreasonable goals on educators and ""protected and rewarded those who achieved targets by cheating. It also alleges she fired principals who failed to achieve goals and ""ignored suspicious"" test score gains throughout the school system. In 2009, Hall was named the National Superintendent of the Year by the Schools Superintendents Association, which at the time said her ""leadership has turned Atlanta into a model of urban school reform."" But the indictment paints another picture of Hall, one of a superintendent with ""a single-minded purpose, and that is to cheat,"" Howard told reporters. ""For example, teachers who reported other teachers who cheated were terminated, while teachers who were caught cheating were only suspended,"" the indictment alleges. ""The message from Beverly Hall was clear: There were to be no exceptions and no excuses for failure to meet targets."" At the heart of the conspiracy to cheat, the indictment said, was money.

"Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is the latest ex-Cabinet official in the Obama administration to publicly come out against President Barack Obama's handling of Syria and Iraq. In an interview on CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" that aired Sunday evening, Panetta told Scott Pelley that he ""really thought that it was important for us to maintain a presence in Iraq."" The United States withdrew its last combat troops from Iraq in 2011 after an agreement could not be reached with Iraqi President Nuri al-Maliki about residual U.S. troops. Panetta also said that the President should have been more aggressive in aiding Syrian opposition fighters two years ago. He said that would have hindered ISIS' rapid expansion of its reach and deadly influence. ""The real key was, how can we develop a leadership group among the opposition that would be able to take control? And my view was to have leverage to do that, we would have to provide the weapons and the training in order for them to really be willing to work with us in that effort,"" he said. Obama insists that arming the rebels sooner wouldn't have helped stop the rise of ISIS. But he now says arming rebels fighting the terror group is a good idea. Congress last week approved his request to provide anti-ISIS Syrian rebels with weapons. This is the second time in a week that Panetta has criticized the President's handling of the latest foreign policy crisis, and he's the second of Obama's two former defense secretaries to publicly split with Obama after leaving the post. Robert Gates, Obama's first defense secretary, who also served under President George W. Bush, has criticized Obama for his handling of Syria. Last week at a forum in Dallas, which Panetta also attended, Gates said, ""My bottom line is, I believe to blow a bunch of stuff up over a couple of days to underscore or validate a point or a principle is not a strategy."" Gates, a Republican, has not been shy about airing his disagreement with Obama's policies. He gave a harsh critique in his memoir of the President's handling of Afghanistan, and in a Washington Post interview in June, Gates said the Obama administration is to blame for ""a bit of neglect of Iraq after U.S. troops left."" Panetta is close with former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Long before he worked in the Obama administration as CIA director and then defense secretary, he served as Bill Clinton's chief of staff in 1994. Over the weekend, Bill Clinton said on CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" that he ""supported two years ago"" his wife's proposal ""to give more robust armed support to the Syrians."" Hillary Clinton is considering a presidential run in 2016 and has tried to distance herself from Obama's foreign policy.","Obama's former defense secretary splits with the President on Iraq and Syria .

"New York (CNN) -- Airline passengers who spent 11 hours stuck on the tarmac at John F. Kennedy International Airport were unloaded Tuesday afternoon in the latest example of the frustrating effects of a massive blizzard that delayed thousands of would-be holiday travelers. The airport, airline and government officials engaged in finger-pointing over delays on the tarmac. ""There were a lot of people on the plane crying,"" said passenger Christina Edgar. ""It was really a tough situation."" She called the situation ""just a bad judgment call."" ""They kept trying to get us to go, and they kept us on the plane with no choice,"" Edgar said. Travelers aboard the Cathay Pacific Airways flight from Vancouver, British Columbia, arrived in New York at 2:12 a.m. ET on Tuesday. They got off the plane shortly after 1 p.m. ET. ""It wasn't fun with three children sitting there,"" said passenger Vincent Butcher. ""No one has admitted to making any mistakes."" At some point, Butcher said, there was even talk of a ladder being brought out to the runway, but that did not happen. The airline told him it may be at least 48 hours before the family gets its luggage, he said. Passenger Max Ascui told ""AC360"" that the crew did a good job but couldn't provide answers on what would happen. Cathay Pacific spokesman Gus Whitcomb said the airline's intention was ""to get passengers to New York as quickly as possible, and we anticipated to have gate space available."" He said the gate typically assigned to the airline had been moved ""because of what became a very fluid situation at JFK due to the weather."" Four international flights were stranded at JFK on Tuesday without gates available to unload passengers, officials said. ""We also had four flights come into LaGuardia, but because they were domestic flights we were able to get them off,"" said Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman. Coleman said that because the JFK flights were international, they had to be unloaded in specific customs areas to undergo screening. ""There is just no place that you can dump 1,000 people in a secured area for a period of time,"" Coleman said. He said the planes were stranded because the airlines brought them in without checking with terminal operations to see if there was a place to put them. The airline's website advised passengers on other flights scheduled for Tuesday to check for confirmed departure times before traveling to the airport. A British Airways spokesman also blamed a lack of gate space for the seven-hour stranding of its passengers on a flight from London. Aeromexico's Flight 404 landed at JFK from Mexico City at 1:15 a.m., more than two hours behind schedule, but passenger Cristobal Alex said it was six hours before he could walk off the plane. ""We were running out of food and water and the pilot came on to say he had been arguing with the folks at the airport to at least let the police come on board to deliver some food and water,"" Alex said. ""And I guess he lost that fight -- nobody came on."" The airport keeps buses ready to help remove passengers from planes stranded on the tarmacs, ""but sometimes the airlines don't inform us,"" said Coleman. The Aeromexico jet pulled up to a gate after several hours on the tarmac, but the doors stayed closed until 7 a.m. ET, Alex said. ""Apparently, what happened was the Customs folks went home at 1 a.m. and so everybody coming international kind of had to sit out there in the snow all night,"" he said. ""It's possible"" the lack of a customs staff caused the deplaning delays for international flights, Coleman said, ""and that's why we have to look into the whole situation."" ""It might have been a situation where too many planes came in with not enough gate space for them,"" Coleman said. However, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman in New York said those reports were incorrect. ""At no point were Customs officials sent home,"" spokesman John Saleh said. ""For flights arriving after midnight, there is usually one terminal available which is always staffed with Customs officers,"" said Saleh. He said Customs officials have been taking multiple shifts to ensure ample staffing, noting that agency has no involvement in passengers deplaning or the removal of their cargo. Saleh said it is the responsibility of the airlines to notify Customs officials when arriving at JFK. The fourth international flight stuck on the tarmac was another Cathay Pacific flight, according to the Port Authority, but it was not known where that flight originated or how long it was stranded. For the passengers who were able to deplane after several hours, some had more frustration ahead -- they were informed they could not access their luggage. Tai Nickel, a passenger aboard the Aeromexico flight, said ""most people were calm"" as they waited inside the plane. ""But once we got out, people were more upset because there were no bags,"" he said. British Airways Flight 183 arrived in New York a few minutes early Monday night, but it took seven hours before a gate was opened ""due to the weather-related problems they have been having lately,"" an airline spokesman said Tuesday morning. ""We fully apologize to customers for this delay, but it is outside our control what parking stands we are allocated,"" said the British Airways spokesman. On the Aeromexico plane, Alex credited flight attendants for keeping their composure. ""They were actually quite nice and pleasant and had a smile on the face throughout the whole ordeal,"" he said. Passengers on several other flights also posted Twitter messages complaining they were stuck on the tarmac at JFK overnight. The Airline Passengers Bill of Rights, which prohibits airlines from letting passengers stay on grounded planes for more than three hours, doesn't apply in these situations. Kate Hanni, executive director of FlyersRights.org, said the rule doesn't apply to international flights. CNN's Elise Zeiger contributed to this report.","Officials say they couldn't accommodate international flight passengers .

"A spate of car bombings rocked Iraq on Tuesday, the ninth anniversary of the U.S. invasion and days before the nation hosts a meeting of Arab leaders. The violence left at least 45 people dead and 216 wounded, officials said. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blasts that one senior Interior Ministry official described as ""coordinated"" and blamed on al Qaeda in Iraq. The official, who did not want to be named because he's not authorized to speak to the media, said the attacks were meant to send a message that the militant group -- despite gains made by Iraqi security forces -- is still able to carry out daily attacks. Attacks took place in Baghdad, Kirkuk, Karbala, Hilla, Tikrit, Baiji, Ramadi, Mosul, Falluja, Diyala province, Salaheddin province, Samarra and Mahmoudiya. Some of them targeted police or government facilities. In central Falluja, a pregnant woman was killed and her 6-year-old child wounded by bombs insurgents planted around a house belonging to a police officer, police in the city said. In Tikrit, a car bombing outside a school wounded four teachers. The attack in Hilla targeted a juvenile detention center; two attacks in Karbala targeted police stations; an army convoy was attacked in Ramadi; and a parked car exploded in front of the Foreign Ministry in Baghdad, officials said. The highest death tolls came from a series of car bomb attacks in Karbala where 13 people were killed. The Minister of State, Government Spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh announced that the Council of Ministers has decided that Baghdad will observe a national holiday, Iraqiya State TV reported. It will begin on Sunday, said state TV. The violence is the worst since February 23, when 50 people were killed and more than 200 were wounded in a string of attacks. Iraqi officials have expressed concern that the continuing violence could cast a shadow as the country prepares to host the next Arab League summit on March 29. The attacks on Tuesday come nine years to the day since a U.S.-led army invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, toppling longtime dictator Saddam Hussein. The United States argued Hussein's regime had been harboring forbidden stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, long-range missiles and a nuclear weapons program. Inspectors later found that Baghdad had attempted to conceal some weapons-related research from the international community, but that Iraq had been effectively disarmed under U.N. sanctions in the 1990s. The invasion swiftly toppled Hussein, who was later executed for the massacre of Shiite villagers following an assassination attempt in the 1980s. But years of bloodshed followed the invasion as an insurgency led by Hussein's allies took root, followed by sectarian warfare between Iraq's Shiite majority and its Sunni minority. Nearly 4,500 Americans and 300-plus allied troops were killed before the last American troops left in December, while estimates of the Iraqi toll run well above 100,000.","At least 45 are dead and 216 wounded, officials say .

"Usually airline passengers side with flight attendants when it comes to safety, but in the case of a US Airways flight Wednesday night, passengers rallied around a blind man and his guide dog and disembarked en masse. All 35 passengers on US Airways Flight 4384 walked off the plane after Albert Rizzi, a blind man from Long Island, and his dog, Doxy, were escorted off the flight after a heated exchange between Rizzi and a flight attendant about where his dog was placed, according to Rizzi. Although he was first to arrive on the tarmac for the flight from Philadelphia International Airport to MacArthur Airport on Long Island, Rizzi said he and his dog were the last to be seated on the small plane. He was seated in the middle of the back row looking onto the aisle with no seat in front of him for Doxy to lie under. Shortly after boarding, Rizzi said a flight attendant told him the dog would need to go under a seat for safety reasons. Several passengers in Rizzi's row offered to have the dog lay under their seats, and he was placed under the seat of the woman to his left, according to Rizzi. The plane was then delayed nearly two hours. While the plane was sitting on the runway, Doxy got up to reposition himself a few times, ending up under Rizzi's seat against the back of the plane, Rizzi said. The flight attendant asked Rizzi to control his dog and keep him underneath his neighbor's seat, according to Rizzi. After a heated exchange between Rizzi and the flight attendant, the pilot announced the plane would be returning to the gate, Rizzi said. Rizzi and his dog were then escorted off the plane by airport security, according to Rizzi. School opens 'investigation' after airline kicks students off plane . After Rizzi and Doxy were removed from the plane, passengers demanded that the flight attendant be removed from the plane and Rizzi let back on, said passenger Kurt Budke. He said that all 35 passengers banded together in support of Rizzi, and after realizing the passengers would not budge, the pilot announced the flight was canceled. If the flight attendant had tried to make alternate accommodations for Rizzi, Budke believes that the situation could have been avoided completely. ""US Airways is sorry for the inconvenience, and we are looking into the situation to see if it was handled properly,"" US Airways spokeswoman Liz Landau said Thursday. She added that the pilot and the flight crew elected to return to the gate due to the safety concerns caused by the actions of the dog and said Rizzi was verbally abusive to the flight attendant. Landau said that the pilot and flight crew didn't feel that it was safe to operate the flight after seeing how upset the customers were at the incident and said that the pilot asked everyone to disembark once it reached the gate. US Airways then provided free buses from the Philadelphia airport to the Long Island airport, Landau said. ""This became the most wonderful experience, out of the most horrible experience. I found that humanity does exist, and people can do the right thing,"" Rizzi said, referring to the actions of his fellow passengers. Rizzi said he has not been contacted by US Airways since the incident and is considering legal action. ""They picked the wrong guy to mess with,"" Rizzi said. He is active in the blind community and sits on the disability advisory board for Suffolk County, where he resides. Rizzi became blind eight years ago after surviving meningitis and has had Doxy for seven years. Rizzi said Doxy is short for Doxology, meaning ""praise to God"" and ""a new beginning."" When they were matched seven years ago, Doxy was just beginning his service as a guide dog and Rizzi was just beginning his life as a blind man.","Albert Rizzi, who is blind, boarded a US Airways flight with guide dog, Doxy .

"WASHINGTON  (CNN) -- Washington notables broke ground on the future home of the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday, symbolically starting construction on the biggest federal building project in the Washington area since the Pentagon 68 years ago. Rendering of future Coast Guard headquarters, with green roof designed to capture and reuse water. The project will bring together more than 15,000 employees now scattered in 35 offices in the region, placing them on a 176-acre campus strewn with historic buildings in a long-neglected corner of Washington, five miles from the Capitol building. Department leaders hope the $3.4 billion consolidation will help the department fulfill its core mission -- protecting the homeland -- in ways big and small. ""It will help us hold meetings,"" Secretary Janet Napolitano said. ""It will help us build that culture of 'One DHS.'"" At the groundbreaking, political leaders shoveled dirt with care, but pitched historical references and metaphors with abandon. ""I do have a kind of paternalistic feeling towards DHS,"" said Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, an early advocate for creating the department. ""I feel like we've finally given a home to this child we've created, which is finally reaching maturity."" Lieberman likened the creation of the department's headquarters to the creation of the Pentagon. Ground was broken on the Pentagon on September 11, 1941, exactly 60 years before the 2001 terrorist attacks, he noted. President Franklin Roosevelt planned the defense consolidation, Lieberman said, because he knew war was imminent and felt it could be coordinated more efficiently from one location. The Department of Homeland Security also will benefit by consolidation, Lieberman said. The site today has the appearance of a sprawling college campus -- although one stuck in time. Established by Congress in 1855 as the Government Hospital for the Insane and later renamed St. Elizabeths, the campus has 62 buildings built between the 1850s and 1940. The federal government plans to preserve 52 of the historic buildings, which are in varying stages of decay. Of the 10 buildings to be destroyed, eight are greenhouses that have major structural damage. Some $650 million in Department of Homeland Security and General Services Administration federal stimulus money is expediting some of the rehabilitation, the latter agency said. The project also includes large amounts of new construction. The first building, a 1.8 million-square-foot U.S. Coast Guard headquarters, will cost about $435 million and is scheduled for completion in 2013. The building will include ""green roofs"" and landscaped courtyards to capture and reuse surface water. Former Homeland Security Adviser Fran Townsend said the department is right to consolidate its facilities but cautioned it won't make the huge differences some people claim it will. ""For one thing, what we know is St. Elizabeths is not big enough to hold all of their headquarters components,"" she said. And while the department needs to be far enough away from downtown Washington to survive an attack, it ""suffers from not having a presence on the National Mall just like all the other major agencies,"" she said. City officials were ebullient Wednesday about the prospect of a blighted area being transformed. The gated campus borders some of Washington's most violent streets. ""They're going to try us, and they're going to like us,"" said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's delegate to Congress. Councilman Marion Barry, who has long complained the area is ignored by the federal government, tweaked visitors at the groundbreaking. ""I hope most of you had your GPS's working,"" he said.","It's biggest federal building project in D.C. area since Pentagon 68 years ago .

"Three times Marilyn Jean Hartman attempted to slip past airport security checkpoints to stowaway on airplanes. And three times the 62-year-old Hartman got caught. This week, authorities say she made it through a screening checkpoint at Mineta San Jose International Airport without a ticket and boarded a Southwest Airlines flight bound for Los Angeles International Airport. ""If you Google her name, you will see she had been arrested before but not at our airport,"" San Jose airport spokeswoman Rosemary Barnes said. Hartman was arrested Monday at the Los Angeles airport, according to a statement released by airport police. She pleaded no contest Wednesday to a misdemeanor count of stowing away, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. She was sentenced to two years probation and three days in jail. She was given credit for time served and released. Outside the courthouse, Hartman refused to detail to reporters how she got through security. ""I don't think it's wise to say how I got through. I don't want to help the enemy,"" she said. ""...I want to go with a paid ticket. ... I want to do everything legal,"" Hartman said. ""It was clearly wrong on my part. ... It was stupid and it is something I don't want to repeat."" Hartman was arrested Monday night after the flight crew determined she did not have a ticket, police said. The flight crew conducted a head count and discovered Hartman ""was not a ticketed passenger on Southwest Airlines,"" the police said. It was unclear how the crew determined Hartman stowed away. ""Further investigation revealed there was no confirmed reservation in the system and Hartman had no documents to show proof that she had purchased a ticket,"" the statement said. It's the second time San Jose International Airport has made headlines in recent months over a reported stowaway. In April, 15-year-old Yahya Abdi crawled into the wheel well of a Hawaii-bound 767 and lost consciousness when the plane took off. He was caught after climbing out of the plane and onto the tarmac at Kahului Airport on the island of Maui. The incident raised questions about how the teen was able to breach security at the airport. Hartman's actions raised the question again this week. Hartman apparently blended in with a family at a checkpoint where a Transportation Security Administration agent was checking tickets and identification, CNN affiliate KTVU reported, citing an unnamed source familiar with the case. She is then accused of doing the same thing -- blending in with a family -- to board the flight, the source said. San Jose airport officials and the TSA said at no time were passengers in jeopardy. Hartman ""was screened by TSA for any prohibited items. It's really important to point that out,"" Barnes said. ""And public safety was not compromised in any way."" Even so, the TSA is making ""minor modifications"" to the layout of its passenger screening area to prevent another incident, said Ross Feinstein, the TSA press secretary. Hartman has been described by authorities as a serial stowaway, who has repeatedly tried to board flights to Hawaii at San Francisco International Airport without a ticket. Earlier this year, she was sentenced to probation and ordered to stay away from the San Francisco airport. 5 stowaway attempts that didn't end tragically .","Marily Jean Hartman, 62, pleaded no contest to stowing away on Southwest flight .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Lockerbie bomber Abdel Basset al-Megrahi is comatose, near death and likely to take secrets of the attack on Pan Am Flight 103 to his grave. CNN found al-Megrahi under the care of his family in his palatial Tripoli villa Sunday, surviving on oxygen and an intravenous drip. The cancer-stricken former Libyan intelligence officer may be the last man alive who knows precisely who in the Libya government authorized the bombing, which killed 270 people. ""We just give him oxygen. Nobody gives us any advice,"" his son, Khaled al-Megrahi, told CNN. CNN's Nic Robertson: 'Not what I was prepared for' Al-Megrahi was freed from a prison in Scotland in 2009 after serving eight years of a life sentence for blowing up the Pan Am jet, killing all 259 on board and 11 in the town of Lockerbie below. Doctors who had been treating him for prostate cancer gave him just three months to live, and he was released on compassionate grounds. He received a hero's welcome in Tripoli, enraging many in the United States and Britain. And with the recent overthrow of longtime Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, politicians on both sides of the Atlantic have called for al-Megrahi to be sent back to prison. Al-Megrahi has been subject of bitter dispute . But the National Transitional Council, the rebel movement that toppled Gadhafi, announced Sunday that it won't allow the dying al-Megrahi to be extradited. ""We will not give any Libyan citizen to the West,"" NTC Justice Minister Mohammed al-Alagi said. Al-Megrahi lived far longer than expected. He made a public appearance with now-fugitive Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi in July, confined to a wheelchair. He always maintained his innocence.

"I once uploaded an Instagram of me at Old Navy trying to get all kissy-face with a mannequin. At the time it seemed like a good idea, but she was rather unresponsive. Probably just not into gingers. It was a silly moment, for sure, but it also accurately illustrated my overall artistic contribution to the world of social photo sharing. Which is to say: Little to none. ""Hey, what filter looks best for an Allman Brothers ticket stub?"" Real Ansel Adams kind of stuff. Finally, about two months ago, I took a short break from Instagram. My farewell offering was a three-second video where I simply exclaimed, ""¡Ay, que lastima!"" Translation: ""Oh, what a shame."" But it wasn't. Nobody cared. Nor should they have. I was using Instagram for all the wrong reasons. And I still am. However, recently, a new account started catching everyone's attention for all the right reasons. Because, unlike my periodic visual odes to my dog's butt, everything about grandmabetty33 is wonderful. And people care. It all started about three months ago when 18-year-old Zach Belden, a high school senior in Jeffersonville, Indiana, decided to start documenting the final days, months, and (hopefully) years of his great-grandmother, Betty Jo Simpson. Grandma Betty has lung cancer. She was diagnosed in December. She's 80. ""Many of my friends knew Grandma,"" Belden told me. ""And it was a neat way to connect her to them."" Amazingly, after about a week, Grandma Betty had nearly 100 followers. And because she's pretty much the cutest thing walking the planet -- sorry, sloths -- her account quickly caught on even more with people who had never even met her. One of Grandma Betty's biggest fans is the musician Pharrell. Belden says they were amazed when she went over 1,000 followers, but when she reached 4,400, somehow that seemed to be the magic number. ""I'll never forget that number,"" Belden says. ""That's when it kicked off."" Soon, they were on TV. Soon, Belden's phone started ringing off the hook. Soon, they had no idea what they were getting themselves into. And soon, Grandma Betty's account began growing by the thousands. At press time she had more than 350,000 followers. Of course, with great fame comes great responsibility. Grandma Betty had to become more tech savvy. There are rules to Internet stardom, and the first one is that you take your own selfies. Which wasn't easy. Belden admits, ""Teaching her how to take a selfie is harder than it probably seems."" But Grandma Betty's getting it, and, more importantly, she gets Instagram. Belden says, ""She knows that I post her pictures and videos on the Internet, people like them, and every time we get the chance, we sit down for a couple hours and just read the heartwarming comments she receives everyday."" But never mind the comments. Grandma Betty had to get a P.O. Box. On Saturday, Belden opened one for his great-grandma, and four days later she got her first letter from a fan in Minnesota. Because, you know, that's what Minnesotans do. Wonderfully nice things. I hate them all. Then, on Thursday, she got 20 additional letters and a package with a handmade lap quilt. People. Sometimes they're just really good. But all this is about more than just some old lady making duck faces and peace signs for the amusement of strangers on the Internet. This is about two people -- generations apart -- finding a creative, 21st-century extension to a close bond that was built over many years. Belden explains, ""Before grade school, I didn't have a babysitter. I had my grandma. We're so undeniably close, and I would hate to lose her. She thinks the same of me and my family -- she tells us every day."" But sometimes she just sticks out her tongue. Like she did when she was visiting the ""cancer doctor"" and was eating blue candy. You could tell. It was definitely blue. And now that image has become the official Grandma Betty logo thanks to a company called 1facewatch who designed it for her based on the photo. So, Grandma Betty has a logo, and fans just keep pouring in. Belden admits, ""Grandma loves Instagram arguably even more than I do. It gives her something to look forward to. You never know what you're gonna get with her."" Which is far more than I can say for myself. I'm recently back on Instagram, and it's pretty much just more photos of my dog's butt. ¡Ay, que lastima!

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States is looking to Libya's rebel movement to decide whether Lockerbie bomber Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi needs to return behind bars, the State Department said Monday. CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson found al Megrahi under the care of his family in his palatial Tripoli villa Sunday, surviving on oxygen and an intravenous drip. The Scottish government has come under fire in recent years for its decision to release al Megrahi from prison in 2009 on the grounds that he had cancer and was not likely to live more than three months. ""Secretary (Hillary) Clinton has made clear, we believe (al Megrahi) should still be behind bars, that the decision to release was not the right decision to make,"" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters Monday. She said the decision is now left to be made by the Libyan rebel movement, the National Transitional Council -- now fighting to quash the last pockets of resistance. ""We need to let them get their feet under themselves as a governing authority and then they have agreed that they will look at this,"" Nuland said. ""We asked the (NTC) to, as soon as it can, take a hard look at what it thinks ought to happen with Mr. Megrahi and it has committed to do that. ""This is a new day in Libya. This is a guy with blood on his hands, the lives of innocents. Libya itself under (Moammar) Gadhafi made a hero of this guy. Presumably a new free democratic Libya would have a different attitude towards a convicted terrorist,"" Nuland added. ""So it is in that spirit that the (NTC) will look at this case. I cannot speak to what decisions will be made."" Earlier Monday, the NTC said there would be no decision made on al Megrahi's fate until a newly elected government is established in the war-torn country. Al Megrahi was freed from a prison in Scotland in 2009 after serving eight years of a life sentence for blowing up the Pan Am jet, killing all 259 on board and 11 in the town of Lockerbie below. Doctors who had been treating him for prostate cancer gave him just three months to live, and he was released on compassionate grounds. He received a hero's welcome in Tripoli, enraging many in the United States and Britain. And with the rebel sweep into Tripoli in recent days, politicians on both sides of the Atlantic have called for al Megrahi to be sent back to prison. But the NTC told CNN Monday that the decision will be left to the future elected government of Libya. The statement appeared to back away from comments made a day earlier by NTC Justice Minister Mohammed al-Alagi, who said the rebels would not allow him to be extradited: ""We will not give any Libyan citizen to the West."" Mahmoud Jibril, president of the executive bureau of the National Transitional Council, contacted CNN Monday to clarify what al-Alagi said. ""What Mr. Alagi was talking about was about a legal point,"" Jibril told CNN. ""He was not talking about a policy or a position taken by the (National Transitional Council). So there is a misperception, a misinterpretation of the statement by Mr. Alagi. ""Mr. Alagi cannot make a policy statement on behalf of the (NTC) or on behalf of the Libyan people,"" Jibril added. ""This will be left to the Libyan people to decide in the future. The (NTC) is an interim body and it cannot decide major issues."" He said ""stability and order"" in Libya is the top priority for the rebel movement. Meanwhile, the Scottish government Monday took aim at critics of its decision to release the bomber. ""As has always been said, al Megrahi is dying of a terminal disease,"" said the Scottish government and the local council that monitors him since his release. ""Speculation about al Megrahi in recent days has been unhelpful, unnecessary and indeed ill-informed,"" the government and East Renfrewshire Council said in a statement. The cancer-stricken former Libyan intelligence officer may be the last man alive who knows precisely who in the Libya government authorized the 1988 bombing. Al Megrahi has lived far longer than expected. He made a public appearance with now-fugitive Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi in July, confined to a wheelchair. He has maintained his innocence. With the rebels holding control of many parts of Tripoli, his care has been left up to his son and his mother. ""We just give him oxygen. Nobody gives us any advice,"" his son, Khaled al Megrahi, told CNN. ""There is no doctor. There is nobody to ask. We don't have any phone line to call anybody.""","Rebel movement should ""take a hard look"" at Lockerbie bomber, State Department says .

"(CNN) -- The price of silverware just got a whole lot more expensive. But can $134 million and the royal seal of approval of the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, bring the coveted America's Cup back to British shores for the first time in history? ""This is about righting a wrong,"" said Ben Ainslie, the most successful Olympic sailor of all time, as he revealed the British team he hopes will defeat billionaire Larry Ellison's reigning U.S. champions. ""We've never won it. We have a huge maritime history. We have to bring this thing home."" In the 163 year history of the race, Britain has never won the prestigious silver trophy. Adding insult to injury, the first competition took place on its shores in 1851. Will the ""Auld Mug,"" as it is affectionately known, finally return to its birthplace in the next edition of the race in 2017? Thanks to that hefty budget -- partly spent on designing high-tech boats capable of slicing through the water at 95 kilometers per hour -- Britain's challenge is not to be taken lightly. Rule Britannia . Glamor to the bid was provided by the Duchess, who joined Ainslie on the manicured lawns of London's Maritime Museum for the official launch on a sweltering summer morning. A keen sailor herself, the Duchess went head-to-head against her husband Prince William in a yacht race during their recent tour of Australia and New Zealand -- emerging victorious 2-0. It's hoped she'll not only pass on some of that winning spirit to Ainslie's team, but also add the type of international lustre so attractive to the world's richest investors. Money matters . Around 40% of the $134 million budget has already been raised, with Ainslie and his board now on the hunt for big commercial sponsorship. It's a huge investment -- and one they're touting as the advertising chance of a lifetime. ""If you could be the brand that brings the America's Cup back to Britain, I think that's a phenomenally powerful thing to be associated with,"" said Charles Dunstone, chairman of the racing team and co-founder of British phone retailer The Carphone Warehouse. ""We certainly wouldn't say it has to be a British company,"" he added. ""But I think it needs to be someone who has business interests and is supportive of Britain."" Ellison's Oracle . The team will need deep pockets to be a serious contender against reigning champions Oracle Team USA -- owned by tech billionaire Larry Ellison, the fifth wealthiest person in the world according to Forbes. Ainslie is under no illusions about the challenges ahead. He was part of Ellison's 2013 winning team, helping them to a thrilling comeback against Emirates Team New Zealand. ""Standing on that podium it did cross my mind that this would be more satisfying with a British team,"" said 37-year-old Ainslie. ""This isn't Larry Ellison's budget, so we have to be very focused with the money we have,"" he said, adding that the multimillion dollar pot would go towards design, logistics, and a world class crew. And if anyone is up to the mammoth task of taking on Ellison, it's got to be Ainslie. ""They say Ainslie has the Midas touch -- I'm not sure about that, but I have seen him time and time again achieve the impossible,"" said Olympic gold medalist and CNN's Main Sail presenter Shirley Robertson. ""That said, he's also no stranger to the monetary might of Ellison and what that can achieve."" Daring design . This is not a competition based on brute strength alone, and part of Britain's success will come down to the clever design of their vessel. Gone are the days of heavy yachts with single hulls and white billowing sails. Today's multihulls are like airplanes on water, sitting high above the waves, with crew members wearing wetsuits, carry oxygen tanks, and communicating via radio. Combined with advancements in TV coverage -- thrilling angles, graphics and on board cameras -- last year's Cup coverage breathed new life into a notoriously unfriendly spectator sport. ""Finally here was a format the public seemed to absolutely love,"" said Dunstone. ""People who had never talked about sailing before, never had any interest in it, suddenly became absolutely captivated by the Cup."" Britain's best bet? Of the six crew members revealed, four hail from Britain and two from New Zealand -- including three times America's Cup winner Jono MacBeth. The New Zealander was quick to point out that Ainslie was ""the type of bloke who always gets in the first round of beers,"" and you get the feeling this isn't just an assemblage of world class athletes, but close friends hoping to make history together. ""I remember as a kid watching these amazing boats racing,"" said Ainslie, who grew up in Cornwall, on England's picturesque south west coast. ""It's just something that hit me, and I had this burning ambition and desire to be part of the America's Cup team -- and ultimately part of the winning British America's Cup team."" How true that turns out to be, we'll soon find out. Timeline: 162 years of America's Cup yacht design . Insight: Aussie wine tycoon to challenge Team USA .

"Australians expect a lot of their country's consular offices when traveling overseas. At least, some of them do. In recent years, Aussies abroad have hit up their government's local overseas reps for everything from help packing their bags to looking after their pets to providing armored cars to the equivalent of a 'get out of jail' card. The Australian government is hitting back, in a manner of speaking. Last week, the country's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), which is responsible for consular services, announced a new three-year Consular Strategy that will, in part, cut back on services rendered to pesky nationals who come calling with petty problems, tying up valuable resources. ""Nobody should argue against helping those in genuine trouble, but far too often our valuable consular assets are being diverted to help those who are more than capable of taking personal responsibility to solve their problems,"" wrote Minister of Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop in a public scold titled ""Australian travelers need to become more self-reliant."" Bishop's article appeared in the Interpreter, a foreign policy website published by the Sydney-based Lowry Institute for International Policy. ""There is a limit to what our consular officers can do,"" an exasperated-sounding Bishop continued. ""The Government is sending a clear message to individuals who have unreasonable or unrealistic demands: consular assistance is not a right and if you deliberately or willfully abuse it, you cannot expect more than the absolute minimum level of assistance and advice."" How outrageous have some of those requests for help been? Behold, this list of 20 rather unsusual pleas for assistance, provided by DFAT: . 1. A traveler who was destitute refused to return to Australia without their pet, which could not be returned for quarantine reasons. 2. A mother who wanted the Embassy in Bangkok to book accommodation and a return ticket to Australia for her son, then provide an embassy driver to take him to the airport. 3. A request from an Australian traveler for DFAT to feed her dogs while she was away. 4. I'm attending a conference overseas with a large group of Australians but I have heard it is a dangerous city. Can the High Commission arrange for a risk assessment and some armored cars? We only need them for a week. 5. Multiple enquiries to Embassies overseas as to the closest pub televising the (rugby) State of Origin game. 6. An Australian who had his laptop stolen overseas requested that embassy staff pick him up from the airport, loan him a laptop and provide him with office space for a few days. 7. A traveler who asked whether the sand in Egypt would affect her asthma. 8. Panicked callers regularly reporting Australian travelers missing overseas, after not hearing from them within the first few hours of arriving in country. Consular officers usually explain that getting through customs and immigration can take time. 9. Why won't the Australian Embassy come and pack my bags for me? I'm an 80 year old traveling by myself and too old to pack my own bags. 10. I left some items on an aircraft when I changed flights. Can the Embassy collect it from the airline's lost property? 11. Can the Embassy obtain prescription medicine from Australia and send it to me so I can continue my holiday? 12. Requests for our Embassies to store luggage, hold mail, provide banking facilities or arrange tours for Australian travelers. 13. What is the best way to get a polecat out of your roof? 14. I'm going on a cruise. What will the food be like? Can you drink the water on the ship? 15. Some travelers evacuated from civil unrest in Egypt on government funded flights questioned why they were not entitled to frequent flyer points. Similarly, some travelers evacuated from the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami made seat requests (including for first class). 16. A caller to DFAT's 24 hour Consular Emergency Centre wanted to know the average salary for an expat to expect in Thailand. 17. Does the Embassy know if there are there any hotels in Phnom Penh with vacant rooms? 18. Can the Embassy tell the local police that I have an excellent driving record in Australia and should not have to pay those outstanding speeding fines? 19. What is the best hotel in Phuket? 20. On my last trip to the Philippines I had some trouble with the law. What is the number of the Embassy in Manila so I can call them to get me out of jail when I go back?","Australia's overseas consular offices will no longer accommodate many requests for help .

"(CNN) -- Although his sport might not be the most high-profile Olympic discipline, Paul Elvstrom's four consecutive sailing gold medals -- all in the same individual event -- guarantee him a place in the roll-call of all-time great Olympians. Elvstrom inducted during the launch of the ISAF Sailing Hall of Fame on November 5, 2007 . Only two other athletes -- Al Oerter (Discus) and Carl Lewis (Long Jump) -- have matched his feat, while just three others -- Hubert Raudaschl (Sailing), Durward Knowles (Sailing) and Ivan Ossier (Fencing) -- have, like Elvstrom, appeared in eight or more separate Games. Born and raised near the Hellerup Marina in Copenhagen, Elvstrom began sailing at an early age, honing his skills at the famous Hellerup Sailing Club. He won his first Olympic gold aged 20 at the 1948 London Games (the sailing events were held off Torbay in Devon), competing in the Firefly Class. It was to be the start of an Olympic career spanning an astonishing forty years. He repeated his success four years later in Helsinki -- by which point the Firefly had been renamed the Finn Class -- and again in Melbourne (1956) and Rome (1960). Although the latter were to be the last Games in which he won a medal, he competed at a further four Olympics: Mexico (1968), Munich (1972), Los Angeles (1984) and Seoul (1988). Father-daughter team . In his last two Olympic outings, sailing in the Tornado Class, his boat was crewed by his daughter Trine, the only father-daughter team ever to have appeared together in Olympic competition. They came fourth and 15th respectively. As well as his Olympic victories Elvstrom won a host of other competitions, including 15 World Championships (in eight different classes), and eight European Championships. In addition he has made significant contributions both to the formulation of the rules of competitive sailing, and also to sailing technology. He invented the ""hiking bench"" -- a device that allows sailors to hone their skills on dry land -- and played an important role in the development of, among other things, the ratchet block, flexible life jacket and sailing boots with non-skid soles. In 1996 he was voted Sportsman of the Century by the Danish Sports Federation.","Elvstrom won four consecutive gold medals in the same event .

"There are comebacks -- and then there are comebacks. As the stars and stripes billowed in the San Francisco wind, Oracle Team USA produced one of the most monumental triumphs in sporting history. For a team which had stared into the abyss, trailing 8-1 at one stage, Oracle did what nobody outside of its catamaran believed it could do. Oracle, which defeated the Swiss team Alinghi three years ago, held onto its title when it seemed certain to suffer one of the most humiliating defeats the America's Cup had ever seen. Live blog: As it happened . ""It had everything,"" said Oracle skipper Jimmy Spithill told Sky Sports. ""It was fantastic. We wouldn't have had it any other way. The guys showed so much heart."" Backed by billionaire Larry Ellison, who owns a 25% in Oracle, the team pulled off a fairytale ending which money just cannot buy. The 69-year-old, whose personal fortune is estimated at $41 billion by Forbes Magazine, boarded the boat to take part in the celebrations following a titanic tussle. The America's Cup is the oldest trophy in international sport -- but rarely has sailing's pinnacle event ever been so dramatic. It speaks volumes that even those who had barely heard of the event last week suddenly became hooked on a race which has been going since 1851. And yet this contest should have been all over before Wednesday's fantastic finale with Emirates Team New Zealand having stormed into an 8-1 lead. In fact, the challenger should have wrapped up the title with victory in race 13 only for it to be abandoned with its yacht just two minutes from the finish line because of a time limit rule. When the race was rescheduled, Oracle Team USA picked up the win which kept its hopes of a historic comeback alive. Only on two occasions has the destination of the trophy been unknown going into the final race of the competition. Oracle has appeared determined to make life difficult for itself since the start of its defense. The team was given a two point penalty and fined $250,000 after illegally placing lead pellets in their catamarans to gain extra weight. The incident also cost three crew members their place on the team. Racing in AC-72 catamarans, the first time these boats have been used in the competition, the crews expect to sail at around 40 knots or 74 kilometers an hour. Excitement is never far away -- but then again, never is danger. Only last March, British sailor Andrew Simpson died after being trapped under a catamaran in an America's Cup training session with Swedish team Artemis. Last October, the Oracle team came perilously close to an accident of their own, while the Emirates boat has also had its own share of scary moments. But this past fortnight has brought sailing to the forefront of world sport with Oracle's miraculous fightback set to go down as one of the greatest of all time. With both teams needing to win the race to get its hands on the trophy, a tight fought affair was expected. But despite a good start from Team New Zealand, it was the reigning champion which dominated. Led by Britain's four time Olympic gold medalist Ben Ainslie, who replaced John Kostecki as the team tactician with the score at 4-1, Oracle roared back in dramatic fashion. Ainslie is the first Briton to experience victory at the event since Charlie Barr led the American team Columbia to three consecutive victories in 1899, 1901 and 1903. The champagne was in full flow by the time Oracle made it back to dry land with fans in raptures at the side of the port. ""It really is all about the team,"" added Spithill. ""On your own you're nothing, the team make you look great. ""I'm so proud of the boys.  We were staring down the barrel at 8-1 but the boys didn't even flinch. It was a fantastic team effort."" Team New Zealand skipper Dean Barker was left inconsolable at the conclusion of the titanic tussle. He added: ""I'm incredibly proud of the team and what they've achieved but gutted we didn't get the last win we needed to take the cup back to New Zealand. ""It's hard to swallow.""","Oracle Team USA wins America Cup .

"The mass killing near Santa Barbara, California, has prompted a proposal to create a ""gun violence restraining order"" that would temporarily bar a mentally unstable person from buying and possessing firearms after family, partners or friends call police. State Assemblyman Das Williams, a Democrat from Santa Barbara, said Wednesday that the legislation is designed to prevent mass killings similar to last weekend's rampage that left seven people dead, including the suspected killer, in Isla Vista, the off-campus student community for the University of California at Santa Barbara and the local community college. The proposed law would create a system where family members, friends and intimate partners could call police to intervene with troubled loved ones. Law enforcement would be able to investigate threats and ask a judge to issue an order prohibiting firearms purchases and possession, according to Williams and state Assemblywoman Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley), who both announced the legislation. Williams acknowledged that gun rights advocates are certain to challenge the proposal, but he contended the legislation would balance rights because a mentally unstable person would be entitled to a court hearing to overturn the order. ""If I was in Congress, I would be much more daunted about getting this passed,"" Williams told CNN. ""I think here in California, people have determined that enough is enough. We're sick and tired of people dying in mass killings. ""It is not intrusive if the judge still has discretion over the matter at the end of the day,"" Williams said of the proposed law. ""And we believe that in this case -- I'm not omniscient, I can't tell you for sure that the tragedy would have been avoided -- but what's unique about this case is that the mother and father knew there was going to be a problem, and at this point, in current law, there's no way for them to do something about it."" Williams was apparently referring to how a mental health agency had been concerned about Elliot Rodger, 22, the suspected killer in the weekend killings. The agency consulted one of Rodger's relatives and then called police to check on his welfare in April. Police visited Rodger but took no further action. On Friday, Rodger apparently killed himself after allegedly stabbing to death three people in his apartment and fatally shooting two women outside a sorority and a man inside a deli in Isla Vista. The legislators say there is no mechanism to limit firearm access in most cases involving an individual in crisis while that person is in mental health therapy, substance abuse treatment or anger management, the legislators say. Currently in California, family members may call police to intervene, but ""if no crime has been committed, or the individual does not meet the criteria for an involuntary civil commitment to mental health treatment, there is essentially nothing that can be done to prevent that individual from purchasing firearms or to temporarily remove firearms from their possession during the crisis,"" the legislators said in a statement. CNN legal analyst Mel Robbins, a former public defender, echoed that current state law doesn't provide an intervention process for such scenarios. ""There's no mechanism for the police or for the public or for a mental health professional to basically say, 'we need to take a look at this individual,' just like we might yank somebody's driver's license for acting recklessly,"" Robbins said. The legislation has a chance of being approved in California, Robbins said. ""California has some of the toughest gun control laws in the country,"" Robbins said.","Lawmakers seek a state law for families to keep guns away from troubled loved ones .

"(CNN) --   Iolanda Balas' dominance of the high jump transcended Olympic competition. Balas cleared 1.85m to win in Rome in 1960. Although she won consecutive gold medals in Rome in 1960 and in Tokyo in 1964, the Romanian's achievements are perhaps better reflected in her 140 consecutive competitive victories in the event between 1957 and 1967. During that period she also set 14 world records, literally raising the bar from 1.74 meters (becoming in 1958 the first woman to clear six feet (1.83m) to 1.91m. Such was Balas' domination that at the time she set her final world record in 1961 no other woman had gone higher than 1.78m. Her career best 1.91m would stand until 1971, by which point the sport had been revolutionized by Dick Fosbury's famous ""flop"" at the 1968 Olympics. In fact, Balas had the perfect build for the pre-Fosbury era. Standing taller than six foot, her preternaturally long legs were ideally suited to the ""scissors"" style favored by the leading athletes of the day. ""My style is quite obsolete but it suits my body structure,"" she explained later. In Rome and Tokyo none of Balas' opponents even got close. She won her first gold medal in 1960 by a margin of 14 centimeters with a leap of 1.85m -- one centimeter short of the world record she had set in Bucharest earlier in the year. Four years later she retained her title, clearing 1.90m to win by 10 centimeters. Balas continued to compete for three more years, battling with knee problems, until finally in 1967 she was beaten. It was her first defeat since finishing an inauspicious fifth on her Olympic debut in Melbourne in 1956. She went on to become head of the Romanian Athletics Federation.","Olympic record: 2 gold medals .

"(CNN) -- Yoshinobu Miyake is perhaps the only athlete apart from Dick Fosbury who has had a technique named after him. Miyake: the strongest man ever? While Fosbury was throwing himself backward over the bar in the high jump in Mexico City 1968, Miyake was placing his ankles together, instead of apart, for the lifting snatch. The ""Miyake Pull"" was also coined ""Frog Style"" after the stance the lifter adopts before the pull: heels together with knees fanned outward to around sixty degrees with a wide grip on the bar, resembling a frog upon the lift. The technique proved physiologically efficient for a body bearing some 60 kilograms (132 pounds) of stress. Miyake's Olympic gold in 1968 is less well known than Fosbury's, but pound for pound, in his own sport, he is considered one of the strongest men who ever lived -- and Japan's finest weightlifting exponent. The medal re-affirmed Miyake's pre-eminence in the featherweight class and proved he could travel. In 1964 he had also won gold in Tokyo in front of a home crowd, improving on a silver earned in Rome in 1960. Born in Miyagi Prefecture in Honshu, north of Tokyo, in 1939, Miyake was all but unstoppable in the mid-1960s. During that time he set 25 world records, many consecutively as he bettered his own standards. He was the world champion in 1962-1963 and 1964-1965. After coming fourth at the 1972 Munich Games, Miyake retired from competitive action to coach Japan's weightlifting team, helping his brother, Yoshiyuki, become world champion in 1969 and 1971.","Olympic Record: 2 gold medals and 1 silver medal .

"(CNN) -- Birgit Fischer made her Olympic debut in Moscow at the age of 18 and was set to retire after the Sydney Games in 2000. Fischer hopes to add to her 10 Olympic medals in Athens. But the German announced she was coming out of retirement in 2004 in time for the Athens Games, the aim of adding to her 10 medals -- already a canoeing record. Athens brought her a gold and silver medal. It was a different story in Sydney, however, after Fischer had entered the record books with victories in the 500 meters pairs and the 500 meters fours. ""No more competition,"" she had said as she climbed out of the canoe after becoming the first woman in Olympic history to win gold 20 years apart and the fifth competitor to collect winner's medals at five separate Games. ""Sometimes you just have to finish and it's great to finish on a high."" But perhaps Fischer felt she is still owed a Games. As an 18-year-old in Moscow in 1980, Fischer claimed gold in the individual event. But she missed the 1984 Games -- at a time when she was a world champion at singles, pairs and fours -- as East Germany joined the Soviet Union in boycotting Los Angeles. In Seoul in 1988 Fischer was beaten into second place in the singles final, but she shrugged off the defeat to win gold in the pairs and the fours. Unified team . Fischer briefly retired after Seoul, but by 1992 she was back in competition as part of a unified German team. In Barcelona she regained the individual title she had previously won in 1980 and also collected a silver medal in the fours. Two more medals in Atlanta in 1996 (a gold in the fours and a silver in the pairs) set Fischer up for her record-breaking efforts in Sydney. Fischer also won 27 world championship titles between 1979 and 1999, yet in a sport that is rarely in the spotlight she remains modest about her achievements. ""The number of medals is simply not that important to me,"" she said after Sydney. ""Most of the medals I have won have been in team events, so the medals are not just my medals but are earned by the rest of the team members as well.""","Olympic record: 8 gold medals, 4 silver medals .

"(CNN) -- For two weeks in 1976, Nadia Comaneci was probably the most recognizable person on the planet. Comaneci scored seven perfect 10s in Montreal in 1976. Just 14-years-old and standing less than five feet tall, the elfin Romanian was the undisputed star of that year's Games in Montreal after becoming the first gymnast in history to score a perfect 10. Comaneci finished up with three gold medals and -- just to prove that her initial effort had been no fluke -- seven perfect scores. Her initial performance on the uneven parallel bars was greeted with uproar as the three-digit scoreboard, struggling to cope with what had been considered an unachievable feat, flashed up 1.00. Comaneci finished with four perfect 10s and the gold medal on the bars, but it was on the balance beam, one of gymnastics' most dangerous disciplines, that Comaneci truly dazzled. Seemingly fearless, Comaneci pirouetted and back-flipped her way to two more perfect 10s and her second gold. Her final perfect score came in the floor routine as she also collected first place in the overall competition. Comaneci's transformation into an international celebrity -- she appeared on the front covers of Time, Newsweek and Sports Illustrated in the same week -- had been as unexpected as it was sudden. Yet Comaneci had been working towards the Olympics ever since she had been picked out as a gymnast of rare talents as a six-year-old growing up in the industrial town of Onesti. The reality of life as an Olympic champion at home in Nicolae Ceausescu's Romania however, was not easy. Constant surveillance Comaneci was honored as a Hero of Socialist Labor on her return home, yet the regime -- terrified that Comaneci would defect after enjoying her taste of western celebrity -- kept its greatest star under constant surveillance. Four years later, a very different Comaneci returned to Olympic competition in Moscow. As an 18-year-old, she was four inches taller, 20 pounds heavier and suffering from sciatica -- a teenage starlet already starting to fade. Still, Comaneci was able to retain her gold medal on the balance beam, and collected another one in the floor exercises. But she was also involved in one of the bitterest incidents of the Games when she was controversially beaten in the all-round competition by the Soviet gymnast Yelena Davydova. It took the judges 28 minutes to decide the result and, ultimately, it was a lower score from the Soviet judge -- perhaps reflecting the worsening relations between the Soviet Union and its formerly loyal satellite -- that denied Comaneci her second straight gold in the event. Comaneci retired in 1984, traveling to Los Angeles that year as a team coach, yet she found it difficult to adjust to a life out of the spotlight. In 1989, a few weeks before the collapse of the Ceausescu regime, she defected to the United States, finally settling in Norman, Oklahoma to run a gymnastics school after marrying U.S. gymnastics star Bart Conner in 1996. In 2000 Comaneci was named as one of the athletes of the century by the Laureus World Sports Academy.","Olympic gymnast record: 5 gold medals, 3 silver medals, 1 bronze medal .

"(CNN) -- Renowned as much for her behavior out of the pool as her victories in it, Dawn Fraser is the greatest, and certainly most colorful female swimmer in Olympic history. Fraser was the first woman ever to successfully defend an Olympic title. The Australian won eight Olympic medals and was the first swimmer, either male or female, to win gold in the same event at three successive Olympiads. The youngest of eight children, she suffered from chronic childhood asthma and took up swimming to help improve her breathing. ""Mine was a complete love affair,"" she later recalled. ""It's a beautiful thing, diving into the cool crisp water and then just sort of being able to pull your body through the water and it opening up for you."" Her talent was spotted by coach Harry Gallagher, the latter agreeing to train her for free on account of her family's poverty. By the age of 16 she was already breaking national records, one of a group of outstanding young Australian female swimmers of that period known collectively as ""The Water Babes."" She came to world attention in February 1956 when she bettered Willy den Ouden's 20-year old world record for the 100-meters freestyle. At her first Olympics later that year, in Melbourne, she set another world record in the same event -- 62 seconds -- and took a second gold in the 4x100 meters freestyle relay, the latter also in a world record time (four minutes 17.1 seconds). Successful defense . She repeated her 100 meters freestyle victory in Rome four years later, the only Australian woman to win a gold medal at that particular Olympiad, and the first ever woman to successfully defend an Olympic swimming title. She also picked up two silver medals, in the 4x100 meters medley relay and 4x100 meters freestyle relay. For all her success, however, the 1960 Games were notable as much for her clashes with sponsors, teammates and Australian swimming officials as her triumphs in the pool. She was subsequently dropped from the Australian squad and, after further run-ins with officialdom, received a two-year ban from international competition. Despite this, and a horrific car crash in early 1964 in which her mother was killed and Fraser herself seriously injured, she again successfully defended her 100-meter freestyle title at the Tokyo Olympics, beating off a spirited challenge from Sharon Stouder of the United States to become the first swimmer ever to win the same event at three successive Games. The high-jinx and confrontations continued, however -- she was arrested for allegedly stealing a flag from the Japanese Imperial palace -- and shortly after the 1964 Olympics the Australian Swimming Union banned her for 10 years, bringing her competitive career to an end. She subsequently went into politics and remains an iconic figure in Australia, despite, or perhaps because of, her determined non-conformism. ""I've always been known to speak my mind,"" she once commented. ""I think that's why Australian people like me."" In 1996 she was voted the Person Who Best Symbolizes Australia.","Olympic record: 4  gold medals, 4 silver medals .

"(CNN) --   Just as Brazil is synonymous with football, so Hungary and the ancient sport of fencing are inextricably linked. Take the analogy one step further and Aladar Gerevich must be described as the sport's Pele -- the greatest Olympic swordsmen ever. Between 1928 and 1960 Hungary was unbeaten in the Olympic team saber competition, winning seven straight gold medals. Gerevich joined the team as an 18-year-old in Los Angeles in 1932 and was still there 28 years later in Rome. As well as six team titles, Gerevich also won individual gold in London in 1948, improving on his bronze in 1936, and he completed the full set of medals by claiming silver in Helsinki in 1952. Gerevich remains the only competitor to win the same Olympic event six times, and he is the only person to win gold medals at six editions of the Games. He would surely have won yet more titles too, had his career not been disrupted by World War Two. The highlight of Gerevich's career was his individual title in 1948, an event he dominated so completely that he was beaten just once in 20 bouts. The 1956 Games in Melbourne took place against the backdrop of the Hungarian uprising against Communist rule and its subsequent brutal suppression by the Soviet Union. Despite the distraction -- there was confusion over whether the Hungarian team should compete under the communist flag or the flag of Imre Nagy's short-lived government -- Gerevich once again led his team to victory, although by now he had slipped to fifth in the individual event. While many of his Olympic teammates chose exile, Gerevich returned to Budapest. In 1960, aged 50, he was told that he was too old to compete at another Olympics. Undeterred, Gerevich challenged the entire Hungarian team and beat them all -- going on to collect the seventh gold medal of his illustrious career.","Olympic record: 7 gold medals, 1 silver medal, 1 bronze medal .

"(CNN) --   Nicknamed ""The Gazelle"" on account of her graceful running style and speed around the track, France's Marie-Jose Perec is one of the greatest female sprinters of modern times, and also the most troubled. Perec: the ""Greta Garbo"" of athletics. Born on the French-governed island of Guadeloupe, she was introduced to sprinting by her school gym teacher who, the first time she saw her run, was apparently so surprised by the girl's speed over 100 meters she asked her to do it again because she was convinced her stop-watch had malfunctioned. Her long legs -- by the age of 13 she was already 5'10"" (1.78 meters) tall -- made Perec ideally suited to 200- and 400-meter running, and after her move to Paris in 1984, aged 16, her potential was swiftly spotted. Her competitive career got off to an uncertain start when she was disqualified from her first major tournament -- the French Inter-School Championships -- for stepping out of lane. Thereafter, however, her trajectory was inexorably upwards. Although she only reached the 200-meter quarterfinals in her first Olympic appearance -- in 1988, in Seoul -- four years later, in Barcelona, she swept all before her, beating defending champion Olha Bryzhina by two meters to win the 400-meter gold in 48.83 seconds. She successfully defended her title in Atlanta in 1996, holding off Australia's Cathy Freeman in a thrilling final to win in 48.25 seconds, an Olympic record and the third fastest women's 400-meters time ever posted. In the process she became the first athlete, male or female, to retain an Olympic 400-meter title. Controversy and illness . Three nights later she made history again by winning the 200 meters -- in 22.12 seconds. No other runner in a non-boycotted Olympics had ever before won both 200- and 400-meter titles in the same Games, although America's Michael Johnson emulated her feat 20 minutes later. Despite her enormous success on the track, Perec's career has been dogged by controversy and illness. She has had a number of highly publicized run-ins with the French athletics authorities, and is renowned for her obsession with privacy (she has been dubbed ""the Greta Garbo of athletics""). In 1998 she has diagnosed with Epstein-Barr disease, or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. In 2000 she caused a scandal by storming out of the Sydney Olympics where her showdown with archrival Cathy Freeman had been one of the most highly-anticipated races of the Games. Freeman went on to win the title. Since Sydney Perec has not raced competitively. After a planned comeback at the 2003 world championships in Paris was aborted because of injury, she had been tipped to stage a comeback at Athens, only to kill those rumors in an interview with French television in June. ""I have finally decided to hang up my spikes,"" said Perec. ""I am going to finally discover a real life, an everyday sort of life. I feel euphoric and very excited.""","Olympic record: 3 gold medals .

"A week before a possible government shutdown, the House of Representatives spent time on a Republican bill that doesn't fund any federal agencies, and even its supporters admit is already dead on arrival in the Democratic-led Senate. House Republican leaders are still building support for their spending bill, and are eying a vote next week -- potentially Dec. 11, the same day as the deadline when agencies run out of funds. But as time is running out to avoid a potential crisis, the House voted Thursday to back a measure that's designed to let GOP opponents of President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration vent their frustrations. The ""Preventing Executive Overreach on Immigration Act"" was drafted by Florida Republican Rep. Ted Yoho. It states that the executive branch of government does not have the authority to stop deportations of certain categories of undocumented workers in the United States. It cleared the House in a 219-197 vote that was almost entirely along party lines. But this bill can't undo what the President has done, and even those conservatives who voted for it say it's simply a messaging bill to assert Congress' role in passing new laws. Cruz causes headaches for GOP leaders. Again. Many House conservatives have been pressing Speaker John Boehner to go further in responding to the President's immigration policy, insisting that the House strip away any money in the annual government spending bill so it can prevent the Administration from carrying out its plans. But Boehner and other GOP leaders don't want to risk another shutdown, after the one last fall inflicted major political damage to the party. Instead Republican leaders argue that a vote on this separate bill puts the House on record, and positions them to fight back against the President's executive orders next year, when the GOP controls both the House and the Senate. Those hardliners who want to use the spending bill as leverage in the immigration fight say they back anything that disapproves of the President's actions. But it's not enough for them to get on board with the leaders' plan to postpone any fight using the legislative branch's power of the purse until next year. Republican Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina called the bill ""important first step"" but said he was still not satisfied. ""Is this enough? Ultimately no, I think ultimately we need to defund the president's ability to move forward,"" Sanford argued on the House floor. Boehner appeared confident Thursday that his spending proposal would pass, and predicted at his weekly press conference it would get bipartisan support. The Speaker waved off making any changes to address concerns of conservatives.  In what appeared to be a shot back at those GOP members who Boehner said were ""griping"" about the funding bill, he said ""this was their idea of how to proceed."" Shutdown drama builds in Congress . Democrats denounced the bill and called it a waste of time. Over and over Democrats called on House Republicans to bring up bipartisan immigration legislation for a vote. Obama said at a college summit Thursday that the House GOP bill would ""force talented young people ... to leave our country."" ""It does not make sense for us to want to push talent out rather than make sure that they're staying here and contributing to society,"" he said. ""Rather than deport students and separate families and make it harder for law enforcement to do its job, I just want Congress to work with us to fix a broken immigration system."" Standing next to a life size poster for former Republican President Ronald Reagan in the House chamber, Illinois Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez defended Obama's action and compared what he did last month to action that Reagan signed in the 1980s. ""They didn't call Ronald Reagan a tyrant, they didn't call him lawless. Yet he said 'I would protect a million and a half undocumented people' that you call illegal. He protected them,"" Gutierrez said. Florida Republican Rep. Mario Diaz Balart was one of seven House Republicans to oppose the bill. He told reporters he agrees with his GOP colleagues that the President didn't have the authority to act on his own, but he believes the proper response is to start working on immigration proposals to fix the system. ""There is only way to do this- we have to pass legislation to deal with the issue,"" Diaz-Balart said, adding that the current immigration system ""remains absolutely in a shambles.""","House voted 219-197 to approve bill targeting Obama's immigration order .

"(CNN) -- The diminutive Derartu Tulu -- she stands only 1.56 meters (5 feet 2 inches) tall -- is one of, if not the greatest-ever female runners, the only woman ever to have won a long-distance gold at two separate Olympics. Two Olympic 10,000-meter victories have made Tulu an Ethiopian icon. Born, like so many great athletes, in the highlands of Ethiopia, a member of the Oromo tribe, she grew up tending cattle on the family farm, and was not even aware that she was an especially fast runner until she started taking part in athletics competitions in her teens. She won the World Junior 10,000 meters title in 1990, and at the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo, won her semifinal heat in an Ethiopian national record of 31 minutes 45.95 seconds. In the final, however, she came a disappointing eighth, leading many pundits to dismiss her chances of success at the following year's Barcelona Olympics. They couldn't have been more wrong. In one of the most thrilling 10,000-meter races of all time Tulu overtook South Africa's Elana Meyer just before the bell, running the final lap in 64 seconds to win by 30 meters, in the process becoming the first ever black African woman to win Olympic gold. The race over, she waited at the line for Meyer, a white south African, the two women embracing before joining hands and setting off on an emotional lap of honor together draped in their respective national flags, a gesture that seemed to symbolize hope for a new Africa. Defending her title four years later in Atlanta she could only manage fourth place. Triumphant return . At the 2000 Sydney Games, however, she made a triumphant return, overtaking her compatriot Gete Wami at the bell and sprinting the final 400 meters in an astounding 60 seconds to win in 30 minutes 17.49 seconds, a new African and Olympic record. Her victory made her the first woman ever to win two Olympic long-distance gold medals, and cemented her place as an Ethiopian national icon alongside fellow running legend Haile Gebreselassie (Addis Ababa city council subsequently named a school in her honor). In addition to her two Olympic titles Tulu has won a World Championship gold medal (2001), three World Cross Country titles and the London Marathon (2000). Although her mantle has, in recent years, passed to Britain's Paul Radcliffe, her place in the pantheon of athletic greats remains assured. She has a six year-old daughter, Tsion.","Olympic record: 2 gold medals .

"Washington (CNN) -- The CIA created and controls a paramilitary force of 3,000 Afghans that conducts clandestine missions targeting al Qaeda and Taliban fighters in Pakistan, a U.S. official told CNN on Wednesday. The official described the force as ""well-trained"" and ""effective."" ""You're talking about one of the finest Afghan fighting forces, which has made major contributions to security and stability,"" the official said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the topic. The Counterterrorism Pursuit Teams were first revealed in a new book by Bob Woodward, associate editor at the Washington Post. ""Obama's Wars,"" which lays out deep divisions in the Obama administration over Afghanistan strategy, will be released Monday. According to that book, by the end of a 2009 strategy review, Obama concluded that the task in Afghanistan could not succeed without wiping out al Qaeda and Afghan Taliban havens operating with impunity in the border tribal areas of Pakistan, the Washington Post reported Wednesday. ""We need to make clear to people that the cancer is in Pakistan,"" Obama is quoted as saying in Woodward's book, the Post said. A CIA spokesman would not comment on the paramilitary force. The counterterrorism teams were first formed around 2002 and operated only within Afghanistan, current and former U.S. officials told CNN. According to a former senior intelligence official, the idea was ""to find people who would blend into the Afghan society to do a lot of the clandestine work"" in that country. There is some coordination between the CIA's paramilitary force and U.S. military forces, according to a senior defense official. The official said some level of coordination is necessary, so that friendly forces know when and where each unit is operating. ""We are constantly in contact with our allies in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as our U.S. inter-agency partners,"" the official said. The border region is key for anti-terrorism efforts and the U.S. military has been working with both Pakistan and Afghanistan as part of a crackdown against militants along the border, with U.S. troops operating on the Afghanistan side, the defense official said. ""We still believe that ground zero for al Qaeda's operations and planning is the border area between Afghanistan and Pakistan,"" the defense official said. As the border area in Pakistan became more of a safe haven for al Qaeda, the Taliban and other extremists, the counterterrorism teams' mission expanded into Pakistan. The former intelligence official said the border is a tribal area where people on both sides easily move back and forth. ""Afghans can cross the border in ways Americans cannot,"" said the official. A former U.S. counterterrorism official said a team would enter Pakistan to gather intelligence and to provide targeting information to help the CIA take out suspected terrorists with missiles from unmanned aircraft. This official said only a very few senior Pakistani leaders were aware of the teams and wondered what the fallout might be within Pakistan, suggesting the CIA's Afghan army could be ""at tremendous risk"" if it continues to operate in Pakistan. ""Pakistan will be on the lookout for them now,"" said the former official. But Pakistani officials refuted the claims that CIA-controlled forces are operating within Pakistan. ""Pakistan will never allow boots on its soil,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Basit said, referring to foreign troops. ""This is one of our red lines."" A senior Pakistani military official added that there are 954 checkpoints along the border that are manned by Pakistani security forces. He said it would be ""next to impossible for a group of people to enter Pakistan to chase al Qaeda and Taliban militants."" The official did not want to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media. Al Qaeda in Pakistan remains a lethal enemy for the United States, a counterterrorism official said this week. But with the help of allies, the United States has been able to score ""lots of successes"" against the group, said the official, who also requested anonymity. That includes the success of U.S. unmanned predator strikes in Pakistani regions along the border with Afghanistan. Since the Obama administration took office at the beginning of 2009, missile attacks on suspected terrorists in Pakistan have increased dramatically. The United States has ""cut into their ability to plot, plan and train, but they remain very dangerous, and they are still the hub to all spokes, the heart of al Qaeda,"" the U.S. official said. ""No one's even close to saying it's over in Pakistan. Not at all. In fact, we not only have to keep up the pressure there, we have to spread it to al Qaeda's nodes and affiliates elsewhere."" CNN's Pam Benson, Reza Sayah, Samson Desta and Chris Lawrence contributed to this report.","NEW: The teams stay in contact with ""our allies in both Pakistan and Afghanistan,"" official says .

"(CNN) -- African American Jesse Owens remains the most iconic Olympian of them all. Owens defied Hitler by winning four gold medals in Berlin in 1936. Although there have been more successful athletes in Olympic history, Owens' four gold medals at the Nazi-dominated 1936 Berlin Games earned him a unique place in the sporting hall of fame. Born James Cleveland Owens -- he was nicknamed Jesse by a school teacher -- he was the son of a sharecropper and grandson of slaves. Despite suffering from chronic bronchial problems as a child, he excelled as a high school athlete, and attracted national attention in May 1935 when, at a Big Ten athletics meet in Ann Arbor, Michigan, he set three world records and tied a fourth, all in the space of an hour. It was the Olympic Games of the following year, however, that secured Owens' place in popular mythology. Held in the German capital, Hitler had intended the Xlth Olympiad to stand as a testament to the racial superiority of white Aryan athletes, openly denigrating Afro-American performers as ""non-humans."" In one of the greatest sporting rebuffs of all time, Owens -- one of 18 black athletes on the U.S. team  -- duly won four gold medals in the 100 meters, 200 meters, long jump and 4x100 meters relay. His 100 meters time of 10.3 seconds equaled the Olympic record, while his performances in the 200 meters and long jump -- 20.7 seconds and 8.06 meters respectively -- set new world records. The 39.8 seconds recorded by U.S. 4x100 meters team also set a world record, one that stood for 20 years. Although the Nazi press was openly scathing, condemning the U.S. team's use of 'black auxiliaries', the German spectators recognized Owens' achievement and gave him a standing ovation. The first person to congratulate him after his long jump victory was German silver medallist Luz Long. ""It took a lot of courage for him to befriend me in front of Hitler,"" Owens later commented. ""You can melt down all the medals and cups I have and they wouldn't be a plating on the 24-carat friendship I felt for Long at that moment."" Ticker-tape parade . Owens returned to the U.S. a hero. Despite that, he was unable to escape the racial prejudice and segregationism of his fellow countrymen. Although he received a New York ticker tape parade, he was forced to ride in a freight elevator to a reception in his honor at the Waldorf Astoria. ""Although I wasn't invited to shake hands with Hitler,"" he said, ""I wasn't invited to the White House to shake hands with the President, either."" He failed to attract the endorsements and sponsorship deals enjoyed by white athletes, and was reduced to running exhibition races against dogs and horses to make ends meet. It was not until the 1950s, 20 years after his Berlin triumph, that he finally achieved a measure of financial security, opening a public relations firm and becoming a highly successful public speaker. In 1976 he received the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor the U.S. can bestow, and in 1990, a decade after his death from lung cancer, President George Bush awarded him a posthumous Congressional Medal of Honor. In perhaps the most fitting memorial to his achievements, a street in Berlin was renamed in his honor in 1984.","Olympic record: 4 gold medals .

"In response to a report that his health was failing and that he had been rushed to the hospital, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Thursday that he had the best proof that his recovery from chemotherapy is advancing fine. ""I'm here; this is my answer,"" Chavez told reporters at the presidential palace, raising his arms and gesturing at his body. The president announced in June that doctors had removed a cancerous tumor from his body. He underwent chemotherapy in Cuba the following month. Wearing a red track suit and a baseball cap, Chavez appeared to be his old talkative self Thursday, running through the ""irresponsible"" newspaper report paragraph by paragraph and answering questions from reporters for more than an hour. The Nuevo Herald, citing two unidentified sources who said they were witnesses, reported Thursday that Chavez had been taken to a military hospital on Tuesday because of kidney complications. The report said doctors were considering moving the president to a private hospital where he could be better attended. But Chavez told the state-run broadcaster VTV in a telephone call that he was recovering well from his fourth round of chemotherapy. Then he called for the afternoon news conference at the palace. Before answering questions from a crowd of watching reporters, the leftist left-hander threw a softball with his aides and then switched to a hardball. ""I'm going to start practicing baseball or softball, both things,"" he said. ""I'm anxious. My legs are asking for a little running, jogging, some sun. Being in the barracks for too long is not good for a man who's used to being at the forefront. But, well, we have to follow the rhythms of medical science."" Asked by a U.S. reporter what type of cancer he has, Chavez -- who said he was recuperating from his last round of chemotherapy, which ended 11 days ago -- would not specify. ""I am my own answer,"" he said. ""And the life that I will live from now on -- with the favor of God -- will be my response."" But he said that his last medical examination had yielded ""very positive results."" That extended to his cholesterol level, which he said he had been watching for many years. ""It's normal now, but it could be lower,"" he said. He said he retained an appetite. ""I'm eating. I'm 90 kilos. I used to weigh 84. Of course, I'm not doing a lot of exercise. I'm doing light exercise, but when I start to run and to hit balls and steal second base ..."" About his cancer, the president said only that a tumor the size of a baseball had been removed from his body in a six-hour operation carried out in Cuba in June and that it was cancerous. ""Fortunately, for those who love me and for me, it was encapsulated,"" implying that it might have metastasized had it ruptured. ""The body was protecting itself,"" he said. Referring to reports that the cancer affected his colon and his kidneys, he said, ""All that is false."" And responding to media reports that he is dying, he said, ""Here I am."" But, he acknowledged, ""I'm not in my best form. I used to box."" He compared his foot movements to those of former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali, whom he referred to by his given name of Cassius Clay. The disinformation is part of a campaign that ""many media outlets, including some represented here,"" were part of, he said. ""It's a morbid thing. Morbid. It's morbid, obscene, inhumane. But, oh, well, that's how things are in the world, right?"" He added, ""This is like a soap opera."" The president also revealed that he had been one of the voices calling for the release of two American hikers in Iran. Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer were detained for two years before being released this month. Chavez said that he called and wrote to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad seeking the hikers' release at the behest of actor Sean Penn. Chavez said he considers Penn a friend, and after the two spoke about the hikers, he agreed to add his voice directly with the Iranian president. ""If this call and message helped a little, I am glad. Even if it didn't, "" he said. Last week, a representative for Penn confirmed a report that Penn had flown to Venezuela months ago to speak about the hikers' plight with Chavez.","""This is like a soap opera,"" Chavez says .

"(CNN)The suspect in Wednesday's shootings in Ottawa had ""connections"" to jihadists in Canada who shared a radical Islamist ideology, including at least one who went overseas to fight in Syria, multiple U.S. sources told CNN on Thursday. American officials are searching databases and communications for any links to American-based jihadists, law enforcement officials said. They spoke the same day Canadian lawmakers returned to work after the shootings, giving a standing ovation to the ceremonial Parliament official credited with taking down the gunman who killed a soldier and shook the Parliament area. The legislators' return came as the country tried to come to grips with the second killing of a soldier on home soil in three days, and questions as to why the attacks came and who exactly was behind them. ""We'll be vigilant, but we will not run scared. We will be prudent, but we will not panic. And as for the business of government, well, here we are -- in our seats, in our chamber, in the very heart of our democracy,"" Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper told the House of Commons in Ottawa on Thursday morning. Lawmakers stood and cheered Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers, who officials say took down the suspect in the halls of Parliament minutes after the killing of Canadian army reservist Cpl. Nathan Cirillo at a war memorial nearby. Vickers, who regularly leads a procession into the House as sessions begin, stood with his ceremonial mace and appeared to be emotional during the ovation. It was a step toward normalcy for a government district that was widely locked down for hours after the shootings at Canada's National War Memorial and Parliament Hill. Authorities say a man shot and killed Cirillo, who was standing guard at the war memorial on Wednesday morning. The gunman then entered the nearby main Parliament building in downtown Ottawa, where witnesses say shots were fired -- many by security officers -- before he was shot dead, authorities said. A plainclothes constable who was working security at Parliament was shot in the leg, according to a House of Commons official briefed on the investigation. The injury is not life-threatening, and the constable was treated at a hospital and released, the official said on condition of anonymity. The gunman was Quebec native Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a convert to Islam, U.S. officials told CNN, citing information given to them by Canadian authorities. Canadian investigators haven't provided any possible motives for the shooting. A U.S. law enforcement official told CNN that a connection to terrorism hasn't been ruled out. The shootings left government workers and others locked inside offices for a large portion of the day while police searched buildings to ensure that no other culprit was loose. Wednesday's deadly attack was the second on Canadian soldiers this week. On Monday, a convert to Islam who Canadian authorities said was ""radicalized"" hit two soldiers with a car in Quebec, killing one of them. Police later killed the man. ""When faced with attacks on the country we all love ... I know we will always stand together,"" Prime Minister Harper said Thursday. ""Canadians will not be intimidated."" The suspect . Canadian authorities had confiscated Zehaf-Bibeau's passport when they learned he planned to go fight overseas, a U.S. law enforcement official told CNN's Susan Candiotti. The official said it was not clear when that happened. Zehaf-Bibeau, who was born as Michael Joseph Hall in 1982, had a history of drug use before he converted, two sources said. ""In the days to come, we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had, but this week's events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere in the world,"" Harper said Wednesday. Police are satisfied that only one person was responsible for Wednesday's shootings, Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau told Canadian media outlet CTV News on Thursday morning. Lawmakers pay respects to soldier . Before Parliament reopened, lawmakers gathered outside the memorial -- some holding flowers -- for a moment of silence for Cirillo. ""This was very off the cuff,"" lawmaker Charlie Angus told CNN on Thursday morning. ""I think parliamentarians really just felt that before we walked into the Parliament buildings, we had to pay respect to a young man who gave his life for his country."" Angus said the soldiers' killings this week left the government with plenty of questions. ""The questions we need to ask ourselves (include), 'How are these people getting this crazy ideology that's inspiring them to do these copycat killings?' "" he said. Another question, he said: What can society do to deal with people who find themselves on the fringes? Issues of mental health, he said, need to be addressed. ""We cannot let people like this fall through the cracks and end up doing deranged killings,"" Angus said. CNN's Ashley Fantz, Josh Levs, Catherine E. Shoichet, John Newsome, Pamela Brown, Dana Ford, Elise Labott, Jim Sciutto, Pam Brown, Ana Cabrera and Deb Feyerick contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. officials searching databases and communications for possible clues .

"Israel launched a series of blistering airstrikes Wednesday on what it says are terrorist targets in Gaza, killing the chief of Hamas' military wing and at least eight others, Israeli and Palestinian officials said. As the tensions ratcheted up, the U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting Wednesday evening. Palestinian leaders immediately condemned the attacks as an escalation, with President Mahmoud Abbas calling for an emergency session of the Council of the League of Arab States to discuss what he called Israeli ""aggression,"" the Egyptian state news agency MENA reported. Hamas' military wing warned that Israelis had opened ""the gates of hell on themselves"" with the move. A report on the Israel Defense Forces website said Brig. Gen. Yoav Moredechai would not rule out a ground attack. ""Infantry brigades have been shifted in preparation for the operation,"" he said, according to the website. Israeli military spokeswoman Lt. Colonel Avital Leibovich said: ""There are some reserve units that are preparing but nothing more than that at this point."" There were at least 70 strikes by warplanes and ships Wednesday, officials from Palestinian militant groups said. As night fell, more airstrikes could be heard, and Hamas security officials said four more attacks hit empty swaths of farmland in Gaza late Wednesday. The IDF said at least 128 rockets had been fired from Gaza since Saturday. Q&A on Israeli-Palestinian conflict . Israel's Iron Dome air defense system intercepted 28 rockets launched at Israel on Wednesday,  the IDF said on its Twitter feed, which it was updating almost hourly with new details as well as links to photos. One of the posters on the IDF's feed was Al-Qassam, the military wing of Hamas, which has the Twitter ID of Alqassam Brigades. It wrote: ""@idfspokesperson Our blessed hands will reach your leaders and soldiers wherever they are (You Opened Hell Gates on Yourselves)."" Palestinian medical sources said at least eight people died in the Israeli airstrikes, including two young girls, and 84 others were wounded, 10 in serious condition. However, the health minister in Gaza, Mufid al-Mukhalalati, put the death toll at seven. The dead included Ahmed al-Ja'abari, the popular and influential head of the Hamas military wing, and his son, the group said on its website. The Israeli operation -- which the military calls ""Operation Pillar of Defense"" -- came after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned this week of pending retaliation by Israel for increased rocket attacks from Gaza. ""I would ask you, I'd ask any person around the planet: What would you do if your population was targeted day after day?"" Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said, later adding that ""you have to see our operation as fundamentally defensive."" Egypt recalled its ambassador to Israel on Wednesday, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said. A senior Israeli official said its ambassador to Egypt returned home, but that move wasn't related to the ongoing violence. The official wouldn't comment on whether Israel had pulled its entire diplomatic staff from Egypt. The United States said Israel has the right to defend itself, according to a statement from the State Department. ""We strongly condemn the barrage of rocket fire from Gaza into southern Israel, and we regret the death and injury of innocent Israeli and Palestinian civilians caused by the ensuing violence,"" the statement said.  ""There is no justification for the violence that Hamas and other terrorist organizations are employing against the people of Israel.  We call on those responsible to stop these cowardly acts immediately."" The White House said in a news release that President Obama spoke with Netanyahu by phone, reiterating the United States support for Israel. Obama also spoke with Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy and the two agreed it was important to help de-escalate the situation quickly, the White House statement said.

""I think the ones who declared war was Israel, and I think the Palestinians are in the position of defending themselves and nothing more than this,"" he said. Hamas will resist as long as the Israeli offensive lasts, Hamdan said. Israeli navy ships could be seen firing into Gaza from the Mediterranean. The navy struck ""terror sites"" there, the IDF said via Twitter. The Israeli military said in a statement Wednesday it targeted ""a significant number of long-range rockets sites"" to deliver ""a significant blow"" to Hamas' underground rocket-launching capabilities and munitions warehouses. Some of the munitions warehouses were in civilian residential buildings, which showed that Hamas uses a strategy of human shields, Israeli military sources said. ""The aim of targeting these sites is to hamper their rocket-launching weapons build up capabilities,"" the IDF statement said, adding that the Gaza strip had become ""a frontal base for Iran firing rockets and carrying out terrorist attacks against Israeli citizens.""

Saeb Erakat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" what he called the Israeli assassination of al-Ja'abari. In an interview with CNN, Erakat labeled the attack the beginning of a ""major, major Israeli escalation,"" and he called on the international community to pressure Israel to halt its operation. Al-Mukhalalati, the Gaza health minister, also called on ""the free world to stop this massacre committed by Israel."" Asked about assassinating al-Ja'abari, Regev said the Hamas military leader headed a ""terror military machine."" ""This is the man with blood on his hands. This man is a known and wanted terrorist,"" he said. ""In taking him out, Israel was acting legitimately."" The latest escalation in violence is part of a cycle of attacks between periods of relative stability between Israel and the Palestinians. ""This was both inevitable and predictable,"" said Aaron David Miller, a Middle East expert and vice president at the Woodrow Wilson Center. There is no long-term basis for both sides to find a lasting peace, he said. Israel and the Palestinians have ""completely different political and strategic goals,"" Miller explained. The focus should be on how to bring security until a basis for long-term stability arises, he added.","President Obama speaks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- ­A patchwork of blood-red welts and purple bruises cover Ramy Essam's back, from his neck down to his thighs. His scars are evidence, he said, that violent groups linked to ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's regime are trying to subvert the revolution. ""There are still some people from the corrupt old regime trying to crush the revolution,"" Essam said, lying face down on his bed, where he has spent days waiting for his wounds to heal. ""With God's will, the revolution will continue."" The 23-year-old student and musician said thugs attacked him and hundreds of others at a peaceful sit-in at Tahrir Square on March 9. Egyptian soldiers were on guard but they didn't come to his rescue. Instead, Essam said, they detained him and scores of others and hauled him to the nearby Egyptian museum where uniformed soldiers tortured him for four hours and cut off his shoulder-length hair. ""It was pain I never imagined I would feel in my life,"" Essam said. ""They took off my clothes. They used sticks, metal rods, wires, whips."" He received electric shocks, he said. ""There was a soldier who would jump in the air and land on my face with his legs."" Essam is convinced he and others were marked men and women at Tahrir Square that day. For weeks, Essam had sung and played his guitar for large crowds celebrating the end of the Mubarak regime. Moments before he was detained, several men pointed him out to soldiers, he said. Essam was released, but human rights groups have said more than 100 innocent activists -- ­ all detained on March 9 -- are still in custody awaiting military trials without access to lawyers. Their stories are almost identical to ­those of protesters who claim they did nothing wrong, but were illegally detained and often beaten by thugs and soldiers. ""It's disgusting. It's inhumane,"" said Cairo based human rights lawyer Ragia Omran. ""Basically, there were plainclothes thugs or informers who were pointing out to the military the people who come to Tahrir Square, and that's how people got picked up."" In a joint statement released this week, nine Egyptian human rights groups said, ""The crime is still going on and the perpetrators deserve a harsher punishment. The junta owes the Egyptian people an apology as they are ruling for the moment."" It's impossible to verify who is behind the violence on March 9. Many suspect remnants from the Mubarak regime with links to rogue factions within the Egyptian military. The events of that day, and other accounts of violence involving soldiers, are fueling doubts about the Egyptian armed forces, the same institution promising a peaceful changeover to democracy. Presidential candidate Amr Moussa has said shadowy elements have also fueled recent violence between Egyptian Christians and Muslims. The army has denied the allegations of torture and abuse, and it said anyone in custody is either suspected or accused of breaking the law. Despite the torture he claimed he suffered at the hands of soldiers, Essam said he still has faith in the army's promise of democracy, but his scars are a reminder that the fight for lasting change in Egypt is not over. Journalists Dina Amer and Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","Ramy Essam says he was one of hundreds attacked at Tahrir Square on March 9 .

"(CNN) -- Authorities have charged a teenage boy who said he planned to hijack a commercial jetliner in an attempt to commit suicide, an FBI spokesman told CNN late Thursday. The 16-year-old was taken into custody by airport police without incident on Tuesday evening after flying from Los Angeles, California, to Nashville, Tennessee, on Southwest Airlines Flight 284. ""His stated intent was to hijack the airplane and commit suicide,"" said George Bolds, an FBI spokesman in Memphis, Tennessee. ""He did indicate he intended to die in Louisiana. It appears he had a ticket to Louisiana."" Bolds said the boy indicated he had lived in Louisiana. The teen wanted to crash the plane into a Hannah Montana concert in Lafayette, Louisiana, two CNN television affiliates in Nashville, WSMV and WTVF, reported, citing unnamed sources. The concert is scheduled for Friday night at the Lafayette Cajundome. Bolds said he had no information on whether the concert may have been targeted as part of the plot. In the teen's possession were handcuffs, duct tape and a type of rope or yarn, according to the FBI. Authorities noted that those are not prohibited items. ""His plan contemplated overpowering the flight crew,"" Bolds said. The teen is being held on unspecified state charges and could face federal charges as well, Bolds said. CNN affiliate WTVF reported the teen has been charged with felony terrorism and is being held at the Davidson County juvenile detention center. ""It is my understanding that at no point in time during the course of the flight there was ever any safety concern,"" Southwest Airlines spokesman Chris Mainz said. Bolds also said nothing threatening occurred on the flight from California to Nashville. It was not immediately clear how police became aware of the teen's presence on the flight or his alleged suicide plans.

"In our increasingly digital world, a mobile phone or other portable device is often a one-stop communication device. Phone calls, text messages, social media and even radio and television can all come from the same gadget. And when the power goes out, these gadgets can quickly become stylish but useless bricks. As a potentially historic blizzard barrels toward the Northeast, now is the time to be juicing up the mobile devices you use to stay connected. Also, don't forget about backup devices like that BlackBerry you got from work, tablets and even e-readers that have Web access. But when the lights go out, you're on your own. Here are some tools and tips to try to keep you connected longer. If you have time to grab some gear now: . Battery charger . A backup charger for your phone or tablet can can keep you linked in longer. ""Juice packs"" can be bought for $100 or less (Mophie, for one, makes them for Apple and Android devices) and many of the chargers double as protective cases for your smartphone or tablet. Alternately, battery-powered backup chargers like the Zagg Sparq can provide several full charges for your mobile devices after the usual electrical options are gone. You can even find chargers that use solar power. So as long as you've got a dry spot and at least a brief break from the rain, Mother Nature can help bail you out. And don't forget about your car charger, assuming you have one. Your car's battery will be solid long after your phone's isn't. Power inverter . If you need to power up something a little bigger than a phone, a power inverter might be a useful tool. If you want to be able to use a laptop or desktop computer during an outage, this may be the way to go. The inverter can be used to convert DC power from your car battery into AC juice for things usually plugged into a wall outlet. Places like Batteries Plus, as well as most computer stores, usually have these around in a wide range of power. Ask an employee how much of a charge you need for what you want to do. Here are some other tips if you don't have the option of buying new chargers: . Laptop as back-up generator . This one seems obvious ... once you've thought about it. But it's the sort of thing that can slip your mind when there's a lot of other preparation to be done. While there's time, fully charge your laptop (or, best case, laptops). Then don't use it. When other power sources go out, you can plug your phone or tablet into the laptop, via the USB port, for the extra juice. Stop running apps . Check your phone's settings. Some apps quietly run in the background even when you're not using them, causing your battery to drain faster. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are two examples, but there are plenty of others. Here's a video for how to disable Wi-Fi on an iPhone and a walkthrough for how to control battery usage on Android devices. (Hat tip to Quartz.com). Also, texting burns less power than a phone call, so go that route when you can. And turning down your screen's brightness will also help conserve juice. Use a battery-life app . Several free apps for both iOS (Apple) and Android devices promise to help you extend your phone's battery life. One such app is Carat, which observes how you use your smartphone and makes personalized suggestions about which power-sucking apps you might delete.","As winter storms approach, be mindful of charging your mobile devices .

"President Franklin D. Roosevelt called her ""Little Miss Miracle."" Such was the power of Shirley Temple during the Great Depression, a dark time when millions were out of work and struggling to survive. Into their midst came a little girl in curls, whose films -- such as ""Little Miss Marker,"" ""Curly Top,"" ""Bright Eyes"" and ""Captain January"" -- allowed them to forget, if just for a little while. ""Shirley could make people believe, if only for 90 minutes, that there were no problems in the world,"" said a fellow child star, Dickie Moore. Shirley Temple Black, perhaps the biggest child star in history, died Monday. She was 85. There had been child stars before Shirley Temple -- Jackie Cooper and Jackie Coogan, to name two -- and there is certainly no shortage of them now, with reality TV and child-targeted cable networks minting a perky new imp every six months. But with her sparkling personality, song-and-dance talent and sheer box-office power, there has likely been no equal in history. Photos: Child star transformations . ""(She) represented, for many, the epitome of childhood goodness and sentiment, a beacon of hope for the future of America and the physical embodiment of the perfect child,"" wrote a British sociologist, Jane Catherine O'Connor, in ""The Cultural Significance of the Child Star."" Share your memories . Shirley Temple everywhere . At the peak of her fame in the mid-1930s there were Shirley Temple dolls, Shirley Temple dresses, Shirley Temple china, Shirley Temple notebooks, Shirley Temple soap and Shirley Temple sheet music. There was a nonalcoholic cocktail -- ginger ale with a touch of grenadine, topped with a maraschino cherry -- named for her. She was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1934. She was the No. 1 box office star in the nation from 1935 to 1938. She almost single-handedly led 20th Century Fox, her studio, back to profitability. She was so well-known, so iconic, that even the number of curls in her hair was publicized. (It's 56, incidentally.) ""I stopped believing in Santa Claus when I was 6,"" she once wrote. ""Mother took me to see him in a department store and he asked for my autograph."" Through it all, she was barely touched by scandal. There were no stories of abusive parents or predatory agents -- though her mother, who did help push her daughter into show business, shaved a year off young Shirley's age to make her more marketable. Indeed, the mere suggestion that she was something less than innocent was enough to prompt a furious outcry. When British author Graham Greene, then an editor and film critic, wrote in a 1937 review that the 8-year-old Temple was an ""adult impersonating a child"" and that her co-stars reacted to her ""well-shaped and desirable little body,"" 20th Century Fox sued. The legal challenge ended up putting Greene's magazine out of business. Adulthood, however, did finally put an end to Temple's film career. In 1940, 20th Century Fox decided not to renew her contract, which was OK with Temple and her family. She went off to a Los Angeles school and, gradually, adjusted to noncelebrity life. She was just about to turn 13. Shirley Temple Black, the ambassador . Class and diplomacy . She did a bit of acting while in school and after graduating -- one film, 1947's ""That Hagen Girl"" with Ronald Reagan, made it into the book ""The Fifty Worst Films of All Time"" -- but after marrying her second husband, Charles Black, she decided to retire in 1950. At 22, her movie career was over. But her life was just beginning. Shirley Temple, child star, became Shirley Temple Black, diplomat, who raised three children, served as a U.N. representative and U.S. ambassador, and generally kept a low and genteel profile. Only rarely did she venture back into acting, most notably for a late-'50s television series. To younger generations, she soon became just a well-known name, her films seen only on late-night TV, her Depression-era celebrity all but vanished. Children of the '70s may know her best for an episode of ""The Brady Bunch"" in which Cindy Brady becomes obsessed with her. Children of the 21st century may not know her at all. And these days, when being a child star almost invariably comes with a 24-hour media circus -- followed by calculated moves to showcase adult-like sex appeal -- one wonders if the fame of a Shirley Temple could last longer than the duration of a YouTube video. (Even in her time it was no easy feat, as biographies of any number of child stars indicate.) No doubt she'd be analyzed, objectified and vivisected all over the Internet, paparazzi lurking outside her door, waiting for a swear word or a blown-up skirt. Still, child stars of any era could do worse than model themselves on Shirley Temple. When she was a movie star, there was nobody bigger. When she wasn't a movie star, there were few classier. Her philosophy was summed up in something she once said in an interview. ""Some people are stuck on this image of the little girl. She is not me,"" she said. ""We shouldn't live in the past. My life is now.""","Shirley Temple was a leading movie star of 1930s .
She represented ""the epitome of childhood goodness and sentiment,"" said one observer .

"Concern is growing for the well-being of four journalists, three of them American citizens, apparently detained in Iran this week, according to The Washington Post. The newspaper reported Thursday that its Tehran correspondent Jason Rezaian, a U.S. citizen, and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, appeared to have been detained Tuesday evening. Two freelance photojournalists, both American citizens, also have been detained, according to The Post. The paper said officials had not yet named the pair. An Iranian official confirmed to CNN that Rezaian and Salehi are among three journalists being held by authorities. He did not say what they have been charged with. The third journalist is a freelance photographer, the official said on condition of anonymity. It's not clear why there is a discrepancy in the number of journalists held. Gholam-Hossein Esmaili, the director general of the Tehran Province Justice Department, is quoted by Iran's official IRNA news agency as saying a ""Washington Post journalist has been detained for some questions and after technical investigations, the judiciary will provide details on the issue."" He did not specify on what grounds the correspondent, whom he did not name, was being held. Iranian security forces are vigilant about all kinds of enemy activities, Esmaili added, according to IRNA. In a statement Thursday, Washington Post foreign editor Douglas Jehl said ""we are deeply troubled by this news and are concerned for the welfare of Jason, Yeganeh and two others said to have been detained with them."" He described Rezaian as ""an experienced, knowledgeable reporter who deserves protection and whose work merits respect."" 'Dismal record' The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was alarmed by The Post's report and urged Iran to release the four journalists. ""We call on Iranian authorities to immediately explain why Jason Rezaian, Yeganeh Salehi, and two other journalists have been detained, and we call for their immediate release,"" said Sherif Mansour, its Middle East and North Africa program coordinator. ""Iran has a dismal record with regard to its treatment of imprisoned journalists. We hold the Iranian government responsible for the safety of these four."" The Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York is following up on the case, spokesman Hamid Babaei said. ""We will inform the media as soon as we receive any news from Tehran,"" Babaei said. According to The Washington Post, Rezaian, 38, holds American and Iranian citizenship. He has been the paper's Tehran correspondent since 2012. His wife, an Iranian citizen who has applied for U.S. permanent residency, is a correspondent for the UAE-based newspaper the National, The Post said. Members of Rezaian's family said they did not want to comment at this time, the paper added. Thomas Erdbrink, Tehran bureau chief for The New York Times, said via Twitter, ""I strongly condemn the arrest of my friend and colleague @jrezaian and his wife @YeganehSalehi, and two photographers, also friends."" Past detentions . Rallies are being held in Iran to mark Quds (Jerusalem) Day on what is the last Friday of the holy month of Ramadan. Muslims worldwide mark this day each year to remember the plight of the Palestinians. Several foreign journalists are in Tehran to cover the event, which includes an anti-Israel demonstration after the Friday prayers. According to CPJ research, there are 35 journalists in prison in Iran. The organization also highlights past instances in which Iran has detained international journalists, including the case of U.S. freelancer Roxana Saberi.

"U.S. Brig. Gen. Terence Hildner died in Kabul of apparent natural causes, officials said, making him the highest ranking officer to die in Afghanistan. He was 49. Hildner, who was commander of the 13th Expeditionary Sustainment Command, Fort Hood, Texas, was in Afghanistan to support the NATO training mission. ""The unfortunate and untimely death of Brigadier General Hildner was a shock to our unit and Families,"" Col. Knowles Atchison, 13th ESC rear commander, said in a statement posted on the Fort Hood website. ""Both forward deployed elements and we at home station are deeply saddened by this loss. We will all pull together through this difficult period and care for one another."" The circumstances surrounding his death are under investigation, the statement said. Hildner graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1984 and attended the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College in 1997. A Connecticut native, he listed his home in Fairfax, Virginia. In 2003, Hildner assumed command of the 13th Corps Support Command's Special Troops Battalion at Fort Hood. That battalion conducted two operational deployments during his years in command -- the first in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the second in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Previously, Hildner served in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm and participated in the last U.S. patrol along the East-West German border before its reunification.","Terence Hildner, 49, died of ""apparent natural causes""

"A federal appeals court ruling that upholds a key portion of a Texas law will effectively close the doors on all but a handful of abortion clinics in the state, abortion rights groups say. The decision by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, on Thursday gave Texas the green light to move forward on the mandate requiring all abortion clinics in the state be ""ambulatory surgical centers,"" regulated under the same standards as hospitals. Lawmakers in the state's Republican-majority Legislature have said this would improve patient care and safety. Abortion rights groups say the law is designed to make it nearly impossible to operate an abortion clinic in Texas. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to intervene previously when other sections of the Texas law were challenged in court. The Center for Reproductive Rights sued Texas in April on behalf of a coalition of abortion clinics. In August, a District Court judge ruled that the ""ambulatory surgical centers"" requirement was unconstitutional and imposed an injunction. Thursday's appeals court ruling lifted that injunction and allows H.B. 2 to go into effect immediately. Lauren Bean, spokeswoman for the Texas Attorney General's Office, said in a statement after the ruling, ""This decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the Texas Legislature to craft a law to protect the health and safety of Texas women."" Abortion rights groups say the mandate will leave women of reproductive age in the state with minimal health care options. ""We are already seeing that Texans are suffering because of H.B. 2, and with the closure of all but eight abortion clinics in a state as large and populous as Texas, the effects will be devastating,"" said Heather Busby, executive director of the NARAL Pro-Choice America. The decision, abortion rights activist say, would result in over 1 million Texas women having to travel a minimum of 300 miles round-trip to have an abortion. The ruling will leave the state with no abortion providers in the Rio Grande Valley or West Texas along the Texas-Mexico border. The state law also bans abortions past 20 weeks of pregnancy and tightens usage guidelines for ""abortion-inducing drugs"" such as RU-486. Another part of the law -- requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic where an abortion is performed -- also is under review by a federal appeals court. Critics contend the law, in addition to eliminating abortion across huge swaths of the state, will further deny access to many women in rural communities and will force women to seek dangerous ""back-alley"" abortions. ""It is gravely disappointing that the 5th Circuit has put ideology above the law,"" said Heather Busby, Pro-Choice Texas Executive Director in a statement. ""When the need for abortion stays the same, but there are fewer reputable providers available, it creates the space for illegal providers and unsafe self-abortion care,"" added Busby. Gov. Rick Perry signed the bill into law last year.","Ruling was on section of Texas law requiring abortion clinics to adhere to hospital-level standards .

"Bombs in Shiite areas of Iraq claimed the lives of 25 people Sunday, the second day of the Muslim holy month Ramadan. An Iraqi soldier and a policeman also died in separate incidents. The violence started in the morning, when a car bomb exploded outside a popular restaurant in the central city of Najaf, about 100 miles south of Baghdad, an official with Iraq's Interior Ministry said. Five people were killed and 14 others were wounded. Just before sunset, when Muslims break their daily Ramadan fast, three roadside bombs exploded within a few minutes of each other at the crowded al-Tameem market in a predominantly Shiite area in Baghdad's southern outskirts, police officials in the capital said. Fifteen people were killed and 60 others wounded, police said. Police: 11 dead, 37 wounded in Iraq blast . Later in the evening, five people were killed and 25 wounded when a car bomb exploded in another market, this time in Mahmoudiya, a predominantly Shiite area about 19 miles south of the capital, police in Baghdad said. Separately, a sniper killed an Iraqi soldier in Falluja on Sunday afternoon as he stood near his patrol, local police officials said. Falluja is in Anbar province, just west of Baghdad. A car bomb exploded near a police patrol in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul in the evening, killing a policeman and wounding 16 others, including three officers, a police official in the city said. The city is predominantly Sunni. While the violence in Iraq has dropped since the peak of sectarian strife between 2005 and 2007, Iraqi residents continue to express concerns over the stability of the country and the efficacy of its security forces. 6 killed, 20 wounded in Iraq bomb blast, police say . Bombings over three consecutive days earlier this month left 52 people dead. In June, at least 240 people were killed in militant attacks in Iraq, according to CNN estimates. The recent carnage coincides with an emerging political crisis in the war-torn Middle Eastern nation, which faces an increasingly fractious legislature as Iraq's Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish political blocs increasingly seem at odds. Shiite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has struggled to forge a lasting power-sharing agreement and has yet to fill key Cabinet positions, including the ministers of defense, interior and national security, while his backers have also shown signs of wobbling support.

"Spider-Woman has never been one of the major characters in comic books, but Marvel hopes that she will make a splash with her new look. The original Spider-Woman, Jessica Drew -- who, oddly enough, was created purely so Marvel would have the rights to the name in 1977 -- has kept the same red and yellow costume for decades (a new Spider-Woman wore a black costume, matching Spider-Man's briefly in the 1980s). Now Marvel is ready to update the character with a more modern looking outfit that includes a red and black jacket with yellow accents and tight black pants. It follows on the heels of DC Comics' fashionable new take on Batgirl earlier this year (like CNN, DC Comics is a Time Warner company). That  costume also included a jacket. Artist Kris Anka says that the idea for the design has been in the works since July. We'll get our first look at the new Spider-Woman in the fifth issue come March. Editor Nick Lowe told USA Today, ""Spider-Man isn't really a detective -- he swings around looking for trouble, whereas Jess needs to go and figure stuff out and dig things up, and you can't really do that head to toe in spandex very well."" Spider-Woman quickly trended worldwide on Twitter Thursday morning after the new look was released, and fan reaction was mixed. ""Check out the functionality of #SpiderWoman's new duds!! So cool! Now to figure out how to make that happen IRL,"" said Moviepilot.com's Catrina Dennis. ""I just think Spider-Woman looked iconic,"" @Twyst tweeted.

"Lawyers for suspected Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokar Tsarnaev have asked a federal court to strike comments he made at a hospital after suffering wounds during a manhunt that paralyzed the city in the days following the 2013 race. In a motion filed Wednesday, they asserted that authorities repeatedly questioned Tsarnaev, 20, as he begged for rest and requested a lawyer at least 10 times. Defense attorneys said Tsarnaev was groggy and under the influence of several pain medications after undergoing emergency surgery when FBI agents began questioning him hours after his capture on April 19. Tsarnaev had suffered several gunshot wounds, including one to the head, according to the motion. His left eye was sutured shut, his jaw was wired closed and he was unable to hear out of his left ear. He was unable to speak after undergoing a tracheotomy, according to the motion. Unable to respond verbally, Tsarnaev wrote answers to interrogators' questions in a notebook, where his attorneys said he scribbled the word ""lawyer"" 10 times. The motion said other notes showed that he also wrote: ""Can we do this later?"" ""I'm exhausted,"" and ""You said you were gonna let me sleep."" Defense lawyers claimed that any comments Tsarnaev made during these interrogations -- which went on intermittently for hours at the hospital -- should be inadmissible in court because they were not given voluntarily. Government officials have indicated that Tsarnaev was questioned under what is called the ""public safety"" exception to the Miranda warnings, which allows for limited questioning by law enforcement of a suspect to determine if there is imminent danger to the public of an attack. But defense lawyers said Tsarnaev told police after being captured that he had discarded his gun and where it could be found. Tsarnaev is accused of planting the bombs at the finish line of the 2013 race, along with his brother Tamerlan, who was killed during the manhunt. His trial is set for early November, with the government seeking the death penalty. Defense lawyers are expected to argue the younger Tsarnaev was under the ""domination and control"" of his brother. In a separate motion on Wednesday, the defense asked the court to declare the death penalty unconstitutional, calling the practice ""cruel and unusual."" The defense listed several objections to the Federal Death Penalty Act, including ""public and worldwide revulsion over the recurring spectacle of botched executions."" Lawyers specifically pointed to the case of Clayton Lockett, a convicted murderer who died in April of an apparent heart attack almost 45 minutes after his execution began at Oklahoma State Penitentiary.  Authorities said one of his veins collapsed during the administration of a previously unused combination of lethal injection drugs. Defense lawyers also argued the federal government's authority to impose the death penalty should be limited because it is illegal in Massachusetts, where Tsarnaev's trial is scheduled. In seeking the death penalty, prosecutors cite as an aggravating factor Tsarnaev's ""betrayal of the United States."" They claim that after receiving asylum from the United States, he ""enjoyed the freedoms of a United States citizen; and then betrayed his allegiance to the United States"" by killing and maiming its people. Defense attorneys also requested in a separate motion that prosecutors turn over instructions given to the grand jury that indicted Tsarnaev. The lawyers hope to determine whether jurors knew that some findings would be used in the prosecution's pursuit of the death penalty. They argued that this point is particularly significant because the jury was made up of Massachusetts citizens. The state banned the death penalty in 1984. At the time the grand jury was considering its indictment, prosecutors had not publicly revealed their intention to seek the death penalty.","Dzhokar Tsarnaev's attorneys want a court to suppress comments he made in a hospital .

"Singapore's Changi Airport has been crowned the best in the world for the fourth time in 14 years at the prestigious World Airport Awards in Geneva. The Southeast Asian hub beat off competition from Incheon Airport in South Korea and Amsterdam Schiphol in the Netherlands, which came in second and third respectively. The award was based on surveys conducted by international travel research and consultancy group Skytrax, who polled 12.1 million passengers over a nine-month period. A total of 39 services and products -- including check-in, arrivals, transfers, shopping, security and immigration -- were examined at 395 airports across the world.

""In winning this prestigious accolade, Singapore Changi Airport cements its place as one of the world's favorite airports,"" said Edward Plaisted, chairman of Skytrax. A bustling aviation link between east and west -- catering for more than 52 million passengers and 1.81 million tons of cargo in 2012 -- Changi has gained a reputation for its attentive passenger experience and abundant entertainment services. The airport offers free city tours to all travelers on a stopover of five hours or more and plays host to facilities such as an on-site swimming pool, butterfly garden, nature trail and cinemas. Changi was also one of the first airports to introduce free WiFi areas and previously scooped the Skytrax best airport award in 2000 before going on to win again in 2006 and 2010. In an interview for CNN's monthly feature show The Gateway, Changi's executive vice president for airport management, Tan Lye Teck said: ""It's always heart-warming to know there are people who show appreciation for things we do."" ""We will continue essentially what we've always been trying to do (which is put the) passenger, the user, the customer ... at the center of everything,"" he added. See also: The world's record breaking airports . Other destinations to rank highly in the best airport category this year include Hong Kong International and Beijing Capital International, carrying on a tradition of strong Asian performance at the awards. All in all, five out of the top ten airports were based in East  Asian cities. Hong Kong has previously claimed the best airport gong eight times, Incheon twice and Singapore Changi four times. Only one non-Asian airport has ever won the sought-after prize, Amsterdam Schiphol in 1999, the award's inaugural year. Schipol was named the best European airport for 2013 while the honor for best North American destination went to Vancouver International Airport in Canada. Cape Town International, Lima Jorge Chavez International, Panama Tocumen and Abu Dhabi International took home the regional prizes for Africa, South America, Central America and the Middle East respectively.

"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner repeated her call this week to decriminalize personal drug use and crack down on traffickers and dealers. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner says she doesn't like to ""condemn someone who has an addiction."" ""I don't like it when people easily condemn someone who has an addiction as if he were a criminal, as if he were a person who should be persecuted,"" she told a meeting of the National Investigation into the Consumption of Alcohol, Tobacco, Psychopharmaceuticals and Illegal Drugs. ""Those who should be persecuted are those who sell the substances, those who give it away, those who traffic in it."" A poll shows 2 percent of Argentines have tried cocaine, but some people believe decriminalization of drugs could result in wider drug use. Regardless, the Argentine government is pushing Congress to pass the decriminalization legislation by the end of the year. ""Decriminalization of the consumer should include what are called second-generation human rights, but at the same time there should be a strong policy of prevention, so that no one falls in the situation of consuming any substance,"" said Anibal Fernandez, the minister of security and justice. Ethan Nadelmann, founder and executive director of the New York-based Drug Policy Alliance, said such policies have been adopted throughout Europe and other parts of Latin America. ""The evidence generally shows that the decriminalization of possession is not clearly associated with any increase in illicit drug use,"" he said. A few years ago, then-Mexican President Vicente Fox proposed decriminalizing possession of drugs combined with a crackdown on traffickers, but a harsh reaction from the Bush administration caused him to retreat, Nadelmann said. Brazil and Colombia have passed laws decriminalizing drug use in an effort to combat the spread of HIV among injecting drug users, he said. Politicians recognize that ""you basically need to get those people out of the underground and into health systems,"" Nadelmann said. ""This would be part of a growing number of countries in Latin America where there is, either for political or judicial reasons, a push toward decriminalization of personal possession, sometimes combined with initiatives to crack down harder on bigger drug traffickers,"" he said. ""It typically involves both lessening the criminal sanction for possession of cannabis while also providing for alternatives to incarceration for people addicted to drugs who are arrested for drug possession or other minor offenses."" The concept has gained followers in the United States, too, he said, citing statistics that show two-thirds of Americans support drug treatment instead of jail time for first-time drug offenders. On Wednesday, Rep. Barney Frank announced a proposal to end federal penalties for Americans carrying fewer than 100 grams, or almost a quarter-pound, of marijuana. ""The vast amount of human activity ought to be none of the government's business,"" Frank said on Capitol Hill. ""I don't think it is the government's business to tell you how to spend your leisure time."" CNN's Javier Doberti contributed to this story.","President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner says addicts should not be persecuted .

"(CNN) -- A group of Republican senators drafted an alternative stimulus measure that narrows government spending to infrastructure programs and helping unemployed Americans, addresses the housing crisis and relies mostly on tax cuts. Sen. Mel Martinez has been working with GOP senators on an alternative to the current stimulus plan. The $713 billion plan was put together by Florida Sen. Mel Martinez, who has been working with a handful of other GOP senators. The proposal includes $430 billion in tax cuts, $114 billion for infrastructure projects, $138 billion for extending unemployment insurance, food stamps and other provisions to help those in need and $31 billion to address the housing crisis. The draft Martinez put together is a broader approach than what some GOP leaders have suggested. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans appear to want to limit the stimulus to tax cuts and addressing the housing crisis. But the draft is more narrow than the Democrats' plan because it eliminates spending on government programs that Republicans and some Democrats say shouldn't be in the bill because they don't create jobs. Martinez has just started showing the plan to his colleagues, and it is too early to tell how much traction this idea will get among other lawmakers. McConnell on Monday dismissed the idea that Republicans are trying to block passage of the economic stimulus plan. ""Nobody that I know of is trying to keep a package from passing,"" he said at a news conference Monday. ""We're trying to reform it."" The House last week passed an $819 billion stimulus bill without a single Republican vote, despite Obama's efforts to work with both sides of the aisle. The House version is two-thirds spending and one-third tax cuts. Of concern for Republicans has been how much of the money will be spent in the near future. An analysis released Monday by the Congressional Budget Office estimated the stimulus plan before the Senate would use 78 percent of the proposed funding (including the lost revenue from tax cuts) by the end of fiscal year 2010. Sixty-four percent of the House bill would be put to use during the same period, according to the report. Much of the $550 billion in spending is divided among these areas: $142 billion for education, $111 billion for health care, $90 billion for infrastructure, $72 billion for aid and benefits, $54 billion for energy, $16 billion for science and technology and $13 billion for housing. Republicans have blasted numerous measures in the package, such as funding for veterans in the Philippines, sod on the National Mall and honey bee insurance. On Monday, Senate Democrats dropped two controversial spending programs in the Senate economic stimulus bill: $75 million for anti-smoking programs and $400 million for the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV. Two Democratic leadership sources told CNN on Monday that the Democrats dropped the programs as a ""symbolic gesture"" to show Republicans they are listening to their objections. But one of the Democratic sources also said, ""It's hard to explain when you're in the midst of a crisis why these programs are important. When people are struggling and thinking about their jobs, it's hard to make that connection."" Republicans, and even some Democrats, have been pointing to both of these items as prime examples of ""excess spending"" that doesn't belong in the stimulus bill. The CBO analysis said the stimulus plan before the Senate would increase the deficit by $885 billion over the next decade -- about $64 million more than the bill passed by the House last week. The cost difference is due in large part to a provision in the Senate bill that would ""patch"" for one year the Alternative Minimum Tax so that it doesn't start to hit middle- and upper-middle-income families. Sen. John McCain said Monday that he would not be able to vote for the Senate bill in its current form.  Watch McCain explain why he'd vote no » . The former GOP presidential nominee said President Obama and Democrats will have to ""seriously negotiate"" with Republicans if they want to pass a stimulus plan with bipartisan support. ""I think we are clearly prepared to sit down, discuss, negotiate a true stimulus package that will create jobs,"" McCain said on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""But now it's time, after the way it went through the House without any Republican support. It's been rammed through the Senate so far. We need to seriously negotiate. We haven't done that yet."" McCain said he's been working with fellow Republican senators to come up with a plan that eliminates policy changes that have nothing to do with job creation. He said the way to separate what's pork and what isn't is by asking two things: Does it take effect in the next year or so? And does it create jobs? One change already made in the Senate version is the addition of $71 billion to fix the Alternative Minimum Tax, which was intended to place a tax on the wealthy but now hits many middle-class families. The Senate bill also adds a $300 payment to seniors, disabled people and others who can't work and suspends taxes on the first $2,400 on unemployment benefits. Meanwhile, House Republican leaders put out a list of more than 30 ""wasteful"" provisions in the Senate version of the stimulus, including: . • A $246 million tax break for Hollywood movie producers to buy motion pictures . • $650 million for the digital television (DTV) converter box coupon program . • $248 million for furniture at the new Department of Homeland Security headquarters . • $600 million to buy hybrid vehicles for federal employees . • $1 billion for the 2010 Census . Asked if it would be better for the president to offer up two separate bills -- one for job creation and another for programs Democrats think were neglected during the Bush years -- Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Nebraska, said that ""might be a better way to bifurcate the issues."" ""But, at times, you put things together because of the efficiency of getting something done,"" he said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""And there's no pork in this. Let me say that right away. But there may be some sacred cows."" Nelson and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, spent the weekend scrubbing the bill of spending that does not narrowly target job and economic growth so moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats will be more likely to vote for it. President Obama said Monday that both parties need to work together so that a bill can be passed quickly. ""There are still some differences between Democrats and Republicans on the Hill, between the White House and some of the products that have been discussed on the Hill,"" he said. ""But what we can't do is let very modest differences get in the way of the overall package moving forward swiftly."" Obama's remarks came after meeting with Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas, a Republican governor who supports the economic stimulus program. The president also was meeting Monday with Democratic congressional leaders. Obama said Sunday he's confident that his economic package will have Republican support once the final plan is hammered out. ""I've done extraordinary outreach, I think, to Republicans because they had some good ideas. And I want to make sure that those ideas are incorporated,"" he said in an interview with NBC. ""We're going to be trimming up -- things that are not relevant to putting people back to work right now,"" he said. CNN's Dana Bash and CNNMoney's Jeanne Sahadi contributed to this report.","NEW: Some GOP senators have put together $713 billion alternative .

"(CNN) -- Africa is a land under construction. Last year, over $220 billion was spent on all kinds of building projects in the continent. While foreign architects have clamored to make their mark in the region, a range of local talent has also stepped forward to shape their landscape (and in some cases, export their aesthetic abroad). ""Africa is constantly looking to the North. It doesn't always look in its own backyard, but the truth is, there's a lot of very good indigenous knowledge on the continent,"" says Iain Low, a professor of architecture at the University of Cape Town and editor the South African edition of Architectural Digest. In celebration of that knowledge, we take a look at some of Africa's most exciting contemporary architects. David Adjaye . Born in Tanzania, ""starchitect"" David Adjaye is the son of a Ghanaian diplomat and spent his childhood traveling the globe before settling in Britain at the age of nine. The multi-award winning architect (he has scooped up numerous accolades from both the Royal Institute of British Architects and the American Institute of Architects) has been tapped for a number of high-profile projects over the years, most recently the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC and the Mass Extinction Memorial Observatory in the Isle of Portland, England. Though Adjaye's projects span the globe, he has numerous projects in Africa, including designing the Princes Town resort, in Ghana. In 2012, he opened an office in Ghana's capital, Accra. Kunle Adeyemi . Kunle Adeyemi, the Nigerian-born founder of NLE Architects, made waves last year with the completion of one of his designs: a floating, three-story A-frame school built in Makoko, a slum on the waterfront of Lagos, Nigeria. Bobbing on top of about 250 empty barrels, the school is designed to avoid many of the problems associated with frequently rising water levels. The structure is also green: it makes use of rainwater collection, and solar panels provide the electricity. Though the school accommodates a mere 100 elementary school children, it has potential to act as a model for water-bound communities the world over. ""It didn't start as a big idea, I was trying to solve a small problem the community had. I realized the problem I was trying to solve was a problem for a larger part of the world,"" Adeymi told CNN last year. ""We're now seeing people take interest in this across Africa."" Diebedo Francis Kere . Diebedo Francis Kere's humble beginnings in the small village of Gando, Burkina Faso, have granted him a useful alternate perspective on the architectural needs of his countrymen. ""Kere is deeply grounded in the values of African society,"" says Low. ""He's really the one person trying to transcend tradition and find a new kind of direction that locates architecture within the global self."" Though his firm, Kere Architecture, is based in Berlin, he is also committed to reinvesting his knowledge back into his home country. Burkina Faso's landscape is dotted with schools he designed -- a revolutionary approach that replaces concrete with earth bricks and employs a corrugated steel roof that is raised to allow air for better circulation. The idea is twofold: firstly, a cooler classroom will help improve the student's concentration. Secondly, by employing local materials and labor, Kere helps empower the local community. His efforts have earned him a series of awards, including the prestigious Aga Khan Award for Architecture. Mokena Makeka . For Cape Town architect Mokena Makeka, design is not merely aesthetic; it's democratizing. In both his redesign of the Railway Police Station and the Cape Town Railway Station, Makeka has been significant in putting forth a post-apartheid aesthetic (for example, for the railway station he removed the two separate entrances that -- during the apartheid era -- had been used used to segregate black and white passengers). Makeka Design Lab, of which Makeka is the principal and founder, has been the recipient of several awards, including two Merit Awards from the Cape Institute for Architecture. Though Cape Town is still very close to Makeka's heart, he dreams of having international influence as well. In 2008, he was part of the prestigious Ordos 100 (Herzog & de Meuron handpicked 100 architects globally to put forth designs for the industrial Chinese city). Y Tsai . Heading up the Y Tsai Design Studio, Cape Town architect Y Tsai also believes in using architecture as a means of social reform. In 2012, he won a Loerie Award for converting an old shipping container into a classroom in rural South Africa. The colorful classroom featured an outdoor jungle gym, windows to allow for cross ventilation, a steel roof that can collect rain water, and an outdoor amphitheater for school events. ""Tsai does a lot of really interesting, innovative work with containers,"" notes Low. Read this: Africa's hottest new fashion designers . Mick Pearce . Zimbabwean architect Mick Pearce is a leader when it comes to environmental design. His mission has always been to create buildings that are not only sustainable, but low-maintenance, low-cost and which blend into their natural surroundings. Nature is often a great source of inspiration for Pearce. One of his best-known buildings, for instance, the Eastgate Shopping Center in Harare, Zimbabwe, employed a sustainable temperature control system, using tubes in the walls to move air through the building, based on the system employed by termites. He used a similar model for CH2, a mixed-use development in Melbourne, Australia. SAOTA . Cape Town-based SAOTA -- manned by partners Stefan Antoni, Philip Olmesdahl and Greg Truen -- has become synonymous with sleek, contemporary, high-end design. The firm does a good business in high-end resorts, swank private residences and glimmering commercial centers. ""Their architecture is very glam, very Wallpaper-ish,"" says Low. ""They have built for a lot of African clients, mainly the elite."" The studio, which has a team of 90 designers and technicians, an in-house CGI team and a branch dedicated to furniture and interior design, has pulled in a slew of awards. Most recently, they won an Award of Excellence and an Award of Merit from the South African Institute of Architects for a vacation house in Voelklip, in the Western Cape, a luxurious residence with a large garden and courtyard pool that measures a mere 45-feet wide. Nina Cohen and Fiona Garson . South African architects Nina Cohen and Fiona Garson could very well be in line for some awards this year for renovating a former gas station, car dealership and dental school into the Wits Art Museum, according to Low: . ""They turned it into something beautiful and poetic,"" he says.","African architectural talent is on the rise in the continent .
""Starchitect"" David Adjaye has earned international design awards .
Kunle Adeyemi and Diebedo Francis Kere are among those earning global acclaim ."
"Venice, Italy (CNN) -- Their stare is blank and unblinking; they stand rigid and dumb. Passers-by look on bemused as a child attempts to clamber up one of their backs. It's no harm, they are after all just a pair of concrete cows, painted white with cute little black spots. The question is: what do these rock-solid ungulates have to do with the future of architecture? The answer: more than you imagine. The setting is Venice. I'm here for the 14th Architecture Biennale, directed on this occasion by Rem Koolhaas -- the Dutch, Pritzker prize-winning powerhouse who, over 40 years, has built notable structures everywhere from Texas to Taipei. This, while maintaining a side-line in serious academia, publishing, journalism and, for good measure, a place on Time magazine's list of the world's 100 most influential people. We meet under dappled light in a quiet corner of the Giardini -- a sloping, lovingly tended park, split by a canal and dotted with ""national pavilions"" -- miniature exhibition spaces built by each participating country at various intervals since 1893. Sat in a fresh white shirt without so much as a bead of sweat on his tanned, furrow-less brow, Koolhaas appears remarkably calm for a man who's just spent the last four years managing this colossal undertaking, often referred to as the ""Olympics of Architecture."" ""What's unique about the Biennale is that it's based around these national pavilions... so you end up with a global tour of ideas,"" he says. There are 65 contributing nations this year -- a jump from 55 in 2012 -- including a refreshing dose of non-western first-timers like Mozambique, the Dominican Republic and Morocco. But what are they showing, exactly? ""Architecture should be open to everything. My whole life has been dedicated to expanding the boundaries of architecture - never considering it a single entity ... Events like the Biennale help to open new possibilities precisely by showing us something other than buildings alone,"" explains Koolhaas, whose slim, long physique is at odds with the weighty seriousness of his character. Read more: Astonishing origami exhibit displays dance of art and science . This brings us back to those concrete cows. Guarding the entrance to the neoclassic British pavilion, like quaint, toothless lions, the cows are on loan from Milton Keynes -- the last of the post-war British New Towns -- where they've been serving as unofficial mascots since the mid-70s. They're the opening gambit of an exhibition that includes a poem by William Blake, a portion of a David Hockney painting and snippets from Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange; much of it infused around electric indigo depictions of the UK's most iconic housing estates. For a sentimental Brit like me, it's an exhilarating kaleidoscope of cultural reference points. To echo Koolhaas, it's also a bold reminder that architecture is -- or at least should be - about a great deal more than blueprints, digital renderings and scale models. ""We must accept that it's part of a broader culture,"" says Dutch architectural historian Wouter Vanstiphout, who co-curated the exhibit alongside British architect Sam Jacob. The pair contend that culture -- from the romantic traditions of the late 19th century, to the sci-fi visions and imagined utopias popular right through the 20th -- has had a significant influence on British architecture over the last 100 years. Read more: 7 of the world's most beguiling bus stops . ""These images and ideas have shaped the way we live. So what we've really made is an argument -- an argument that the world is something you can change with a fired-up imagination,"" says Jacob, in what for a moment feels like a rousing call-to-arms. Like all the national pavilions, the British exhibit is a response to a specific theme, set by Koolhaas, titled ""Absorbing Modernity, 1914-2014."" Explaining the idea behind this theme, Koolhaas argues (in fact, he tells me it's more of a ""provocation"") that modern forces -- particularly those of globalism and advancing technology -- have led to a uniform ""international"" architecture (glass towers, square blocks and so on) at the expense of more distinctive, traditional styles worldwide. And so it is that as you stroll from pavilion to pavilion, you encounter all manner of colorful explorations riffing on this idea -- mostly characterized, in fact, by each nation's attempt to show how they are the exception to the rule. Outside the Romanian pavilion, for instance, a small plantation of old-fashioned alarm clocks stand like black sunflowers on long, rigid stalks. It's an eerily surreal reference to factory life, the clockwork operations of workers, and a precursor to an exploration of the factory as the distinguishing symbol of modernity in Romania. Over in the Dominican Republic, the floor is smothered in a brilliant bright, multi-colored carpet -- conjuring a sense of the Caribbean nation's vibrant spirit. In contrast, the thrust of the exhibit dwells on the pre-eminence of concrete which, after the catastrophic San Zenon hurricane of 1930, was obligatory for all new construction. Read more: World's most stylish supercars take a luxury road trip . In this sense, a natural disaster thrust a new mode of architecture onto the island. The result, claim curators Laboratorio de Arquitectura Dominicana, was a distinctive form of modernism -- adapted to the tropical climate with a healthy twist of Dominican flair. Inside the German pavilion there's a full-size partial replica of the Kanzlerbungalow (Chancellor's Bungalow) in Bonn -- built by architect Sep Ruf in 1964. The Kanzlerbungalow was ubiquitous in the West German media during the tenure of the Bonn Republic, and functioned as the ""nation's living room."" Its airy, forward-looking 60s modernism is worlds apart from the formal grandeur of the pavilion itself, which was built during the era of the German Reich. The result is not only a visceral dialogue between two generations of German architectural history, but a statement about the role of politics in shaping the country's national style. A hop, skip and jump and we're in the Russian pavilion -- where the curators have turned the ornate building into a spoof international trade fair. In a playful, tongue-in-cheek turn, 20 fictional companies have set up shop across rows of mock sales stands -- most with a dedicated agent -- offering commercial, distinctly Russian-themed solutions to the problems of contemporary architecture. Read more: Inside the world's biggest furniture fair . A man from ""Estetika Ltd"" tries to sell me some ornamental gold decorations -- with an unmistakably Russian diagonal lattice shape - to fix on the front of my building, making it ""instantly Russian."" Nearby there's ""PrefabCorp"" - a hypothetical merger of all existing Russian prefabricated housing suppliers, and ""Ark-Stroy"" -- a booth selling above-ground bunkers based on Russian social housing blocks, designed for post-apocalyptic living. ""Trade fairs are the ultimate symbol of modernity"" explains co-curator Anton Kalgaev, as he guides me past a series of garish corporate logos. ""They all look exactly the same -- they operate by the most universal language you can imagine."" There's a great sense of theater here, and underneath is a well-considered comment on both the state of modern architecture and the means by which new ideas are communicated and sold. As Kalgaev says, ""the advantage of using this commercial language to display our exhibit is that it explains complicated things in a very easy way."" The Russian pavilion is perhaps the most direct response to Koolhaas' theme -- distilling key aspects of the country's architectural identity into discreet elements. By transforming them into commodities, they also show how facets of our past must be repackaged in a commercial framework in order to survive modernity. Looking back to when he first conceived the idea for this Biennale, Koolhaas says that he was struck by how easy it was, when looking at a series of buildings from a 100 years ago, to identify them by nation. Read more: China's crop of outrageous new hotel designs . Looking at a series of glass towers from around the world today, he says, ""Everyone would agree that there are enormous similarities between them and that it would be reasonably hard to identify any of these in terms of national architecture."" If we are to succeed in finding an antidote to the generic, then looking to our own societies must surely be a critical first step. The Biennale succeeds because it places people -- our history, culture and even our bodies -- at the very heart of its thinking. It may not have all the answers, but it's certainly asking all the right questions.","The Venice Biennale has been described as the Olympics of Architecture .

"Washington (CNN)The boys — and girls — of Capitol Hill are back in town. Lawmakers new and old picked up their keys to their new offices and got sworn in for the 114th Congress on Tuesday. Unlike any other day of the year, all was not pomp and circumstance, but rather chaos and confusion. Animals (at least, a pet or two) roamed the halls; desks and debris lined the Capitol basement walls; Republicans congratulated Democrats and vice-versa. Even Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cuz, two potential GOP presidential primary opponents, hugged it out in the hallways. It marked a rare moment of camaraderie between parties and potential political foes as they prepare for what looks to be as contentious a new Congress as ever. On the House side, an attempt orchestrated by conservatives to unseat John Boehner from his position as Speaker came closer to success than many expected, with more than two dozen Republicans voting against him — a show of discontent not seen, according to the Washington Post, since 1860. And expressed openness from President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to work together seemed already forgotten as the White House promised to veto a bill to approve the Keystone XL  pipeline, which Republicans had promised would be the very first part of their agenda after they took full control. Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, a member of the new Democratic minority in the Senate and a former member of the House, said he was committed to getting something done on Capitol Hill even with Republicans at the helm — but sounded less than confident it was possible. ""Whether in the majority or the minority, you have to work with the other party,"" he said, noting during his decades on the Hill passing hundreds of bills he had always worked with Republicans. But asked whether he felt Republicans were sincere in their stated openness to working with Democrats, Markey admitted: ""My hope is that there is a pent-up desire to legislate."" There was, however, some bipartisan love seen in the halls of Congress on Tuesday, perhaps brought on — or allowed to slip out — by the chaos of the day. Republican Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas received a congratulatory handshake from Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner in the hallway off the old Senate chamber, before turning to say ""hi"" to newly-minted GOP Sen. Steve Daines of Montana. Daines had lost his family in the crush of people waiting for their picture and the potential for a kiss on the cheek from Vice President Joe Biden. WATCH: Joe Biden swearing in senators makes great TV . ""Well, we've got four kids, my wife, my mom and dad!"" Daines shrugged when asked how he managed to lose his family on day one. Florida Rep. Patrick Murphy, who was joined by his look-a-like older brother, planned like many of his colleagues to bring a young family member onto the floor — his younger nephew — while he was sworn in. Former Michigan Sen. Carl Levin was meting out kisses of his own, planting one right on Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray's cheek after scooping her and his successor, new Sen. Gary Peters, into a group hug during Peters' introductory party. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley — who braved a storm in Des Moines to make it in and marveled that he was only 45 minutes late — party-hopped. ""Just get to as many receptions as you can,"" he said, ""and if you're a new member having a reception, stay around and greet and thank as many people that helped you get here."" He said he had already stopped by receptions for newly-minted GOP colleagues Sens. Dan Sullivan, Mike Rounds and Thom Tillis, and had about a dozen receptions he planned to hit — but he'd spend ""most of my time"" with his new colleague from Iowa, Sen. Joni Ernst. Ernst was one of a handful of rising stars on the campaign trail who were finally anointed as full members of their parties on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. Mia Love, an African-American Mormon representative from Utah, got a special visit from Rep. Paul Ryan — who thanked her friends and family for bringing ""this budding star"" to Congress — before heading to the House floor for the first business of the new Congress. Looking somewhat shell-shocked at being accosted by a reporter in the hallways, Love summed up the first day for many congressional newbies: ""I'm excited,"" she said. ""Don't know what to expect."" ""I'm just going"" with it, she added. But there ran, underneath the fun and excitement, an undercurrent of tension that was difficult to ignore. Conservatives who voted against Boehner were grumbling before days end about punishments they were already being given or warned about by the speaker and others. Some Democrats, like West Virginia Sen.

"""Patting, touching, kissing and pinching."" As many of us probably suspect -- and as a number of books about the industry have suggested -- flight attendants are often the target of unwanted attention. Now a survey puts hard numbers -- and descriptions such as the one above -- to the sexual harassment encountered by flight attendants while on-duty. The Hong Kong-based Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) announced its findings in a press release on Thursday. Conducted in partnership with the Hong Kong Flight Attendants Alliance (HKFAA) , the survey results are based on 392 responses to 9,000 questionnaires distributed between November 2013 and January 2014 among employees of the HKFAA's member airlines, including Cathay Pacific, Dragonair, British Airways and United Airlines. Of survey respondents, 86% were female and 14% were male. EOC spokesperson Mariana Law told CNN that the percentage of respondents was low likely for two reasons. ""Most HKFAA flight attendants are not based in Hong Kong, so it may be difficult for them to respond,"" said Law. ""Another reason is that some people may consider sexual harassment an embarrassing or difficult subject and they may not feel comfortable disclosing this information to others."" Among the report's findings: . • About 27% of the respondents (29% of women, 17% of males) reported being sexually harassed while on-duty in-flight in the last twelve months. • Sexual harassment experienced by flight attendants was mostly manifested in the form of physical contact, described as ""patting, touching, kissing or pinching."" • Other forms of sexual harassment encountered included lewd jokes, ""staring in a sexual way,"" ""showing obscene or pornographic materials"" and explicit requests for sexual favors. • About 59% of the sexual harassment came from customers, about 41% from fellow workers, including senior cabin crew and cockpit members . According to the EOC, flight attendants and the airlines that employ them are particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment initiated by passengers or clients. ""There is currently no legal provision protecting providers of goods, services and facilities against sexual harassment by their customers,"" said Dr. John Tse Wing-ling, who leads the EOC's Policy and Research Committee. ""In this connection, the EOC urges the  (Hong Kong) Government to extend the coverage of the Sex Discrimination Ordinance to protect service providers against sexual harassment by customers, which the EOC has long recommended."" According to the EOC, most international airlines have a policy statement on sexual harassment.","Hong Kong Flight Attendants Alliance sent survey to its 9,000 members .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Actor Heath Ledger was found dead Tuesday of a possible drug overdose in a Lower Manhattan apartment, the New York Police Department said. Heath Ledger was unresponsive when a housekeeper found him in a Manhattan apartment Tuesday. The Academy Award-nominated actor was 28. Ledger was found naked and unresponsive, facedown on the floor at the foot of his bed by a housekeeper trying to wake him for an appointment with a masseuse, said police spokesman Paul Browne. ""Pills were found in the vicinity of the bed,"" he told CNN. ""This is being looked at as a possible overdose, but that is not confirmed yet."" Browne later told reporters some prescription medications were found in the room, including sleeping pills. But he stressed police have made no determination of the cause of Ledger's death -- that would be done by the medical examiner. He said the pills were not ""scattered about."" No note was found and there was no indication of foul play, Browne said. Ledger was found at about 3 p.m., and was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency personnel about 3:30 p.m.  Watch a report about Ledger's death » . A crowd of onlookers, photographers and reporters gathered outside the apartment building after news of Ledger's death was reported. Police officers were guarding the doors. Browne said he did not know how long Ledger had been renting the apartment, which he said took up the entire fourth floor. An autopsy would be conducted on Wednesday, said Ellen Borakove, spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner's office.  Watch Ledger's body being removed » .

Condolences began pouring in from Ledger's friends and co-stars. ""I had such great hope for him,"" said Mel Gibson, who played Ledger's father in ""The Patriot,"" in a statement. ""He was just taking off and to lose his life at such a young age is a tragic loss. My thoughts and prayers are with him and his family."" Actress Nicole Kidman, a fellow Australian and close friend of Ledger's, said in a statement, ""What a tragedy. My heart goes out to his family.""  Watch the reaction at the Sundance Film Festival » . At the time of his death, Ledger had just finished playing the villain The Joker in ""The Dark Knight,"" the latest installment in the Batman series. The film is to open in July.

But Ledger was perhaps best known for his 2005 portrayal of Ennis Del Mar in ""Brokeback Mountain,"" about two cowboys who had a secret romantic relationship. The role earned him an Oscar nomination. ""I felt that choices were being made for me, so I feel this has been my time now to find the good stories and test myself,"" Ledger told the Glasgow Herald in the 2005 interview. ""It has been an interesting year, where I finally have a sense of accomplishment."" Asked how he felt about filming love scenes with another man, Ledger said he and his co-star Jake Gyllenhaal simply focused on their roles. ""We can't say that we weren't nervous about it,"" Ledger told Oprah Winfrey in 2006. ""But once the first take was over, it's like, 'OK. So what? It's kissing another human being. How are we going to finish this scene? Let's get on with it and let's get out of here.'

"Imagine you could let your city urinate in a cup and submit the sample to a laboratory for drug testing. Would it pass? Researchers in Europe did something similar with 42 major cities, and many of them failed. Lab tests on sewage water to detect chemicals excreted after drug use turned up high levels of cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, meth and other amphetamines. The scientists' results, published this week in the journal Addiction, read like a top 10 list of European party capitals. Some of them should come as no surprise to experienced travelers. Amsterdam in the Netherlands, for example, where smoking cannabis is tolerated -- though not legal -- in its trademark coffee shops, hovered near the top of the list in every category but meth. The port city, also saddled with the reputation of a red-light district hub, took second place in levels of ecstasy excretions found in wastewater, according to the study led by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology. As for cannabis, a lesser-known town bumped Amsterdam to second place. The top spot for traces of pot in wastewater went to the Serbian city of Novi Sad, population 265,000.  Paris came in third. Serious problems . The study may seem like a review of dereliction hot spots, but its aim is serious: to help detect dangerous addictions and spikes in the use of certain illicit drugs. Multiple governmental authorities, drug prevention councils, universities and laboratories participated in the research. The scientists are hoping to develop a useful monitoring tool. It's hard to get solid data on drug usage, because it's traditionally gathered via questionnaires, the study said. Respondents can fudge the answers or forget details. Drug users also sometimes don't know what they are really taking or whether other drugs are mixed in. The laboratory analysis of wastewater has the potential to get more accurate results more quickly and detect new drugs spreading into a local market. London cocaine, Prague meth . The study reveals apparent preferences for certain drugs in certain regions. Particularly high levels of benzoylecgonine, the main metabolite of cocaine, turned up in the wastewater of Amsterdam, the Belgian city of Antwerp, London and Zurich. Barcelona, Spain, and Basel, Switzerland, were not far behind. London sewage also turned up high levels of ecstasy, but the British capital did not stick out on the list of the other drugs tested for. There were no measurements taken there for cannabis. The Netherlands swept the top three on the list of ecstasy remnants gone down the drain, according to the analysis, but was much further down the list for meth concentration. That drug appears be prevalent in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and parts of Germany. The highest concentration of meth excretions showed up in Prague's wastewater, but in all other categories, the Czech city landed in the mid-teens. The Swiss team turned in results that indicate that ecstasy is a weekend drug in that country. Its excretion levels in wastewater crept along during the week and then rocketed on Fridays, peaked Sundays and nosedived Mondays.

"If you read the headlines out of Chicago this past Easter weekend -- more than 40 shot, including nine killed -- you might be surprised to learn that the city's homicide rate is still trending downward, according to the police chief. Yes, that's right:  Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy told WGN Radio this week that Chicago's homicide rate is ""still ahead of where we were last year, which was a record.""  The number of homicides in Chicago last year dropped to 415, compared to 503 in 2012, an 18% drop.  That lower level hasn't been seen since 1965. ""A week doesn't wipe out two years of progress,"" McCarthy told WGN Radio's Steve Cochran in an interview Monday. ""We always knew that we're going to have good days and we're going to have bad days, we've just got to make sure we're having more good days than bad."" But does a lower murder rate really matter in Chicago, where such rampant gun violence has earned the city the nickname ""Chiraq""? ""People always say, 'I don't feel much better, even though shootings might be down by 40%,'"" McCarthy told CNN.  ""Well, the reason for that is kind of simple. If you have 10 shootings in your neighborhood last year, and you have six shootings in your neighborhood this year, do you feel 40% better? Absolutely not."" There are some Chicago neighborhoods -- poorer, less educated, predominantly African-American and infested with gangs -- that have murder rates 10 times higher than other Chicago areas. McCarthy says the news coverage of shooting incidents like the ones that took place last weekend doesn't paint a complete picture of the police response. ""We are getting out in front of a lot of shootings,"" the police chief told CNN.  ""It's hard to see success sometimes when you have a spate of shootings."" Chicago's gun violence typically heats up as the temperature rises, so the police department has banked some overtime to deploy more officers to the city's trouble spots. In the meantime, McCarthy is using the unwanted attention around the bloody Easter weekend to push legislators to pass gun control laws that he says will help police turn things around in Chicago. ""It's just insanity that there's such a proliferation of firearms that they're so easy to get your hands on,"" McCarthy told WGN Radio on Monday.  ""The studies show when there's more restrictive gun laws, there's less gun violence.  It's not brain surgery, it's really really simple. ""It's going to take us a while to fix poverty and the break-up of the family units and education and jobs.  But we can do something about gun laws today and we're just not doing it."" That may be an uphill climb:  In February, a federal judge struck down Chicago's ban on gun sales, saying it went ""too far in outright banning legal buyers and legal dealers from engaging in lawful acquisitions.""  And in 2010, the Supreme Court declared Chicago's 28-year-old handgun ban unconstitutional. Making it even more difficult, last year, Illinois became the 50th state to allow its residents to carry concealed weapons after a veto from its governor failed to kill the legislation. McCarthy may get some limited help from the feds at least in keeping repeat criminals off the street: the office of newly appointed U.S. Attorney Zachary Fardon announced Monday the creation of a violent crimes section to focus on how to more effectively use federal statues to prosecute those behind Chicago's gun violence, the Chicago Tribune reported. Shortly after Rahm Emanuel took over as Chicago's mayor in early 2011, he brought in McCarthy, who had previously led the police force in Newark, New Jersey.  A year into McCarthy's term, he was hailed as a hero. Then, the city's homicide rate skyrocketed at end of 2012 and there were calls for McCarthy's resignation. As the murder rate started to drop, those calls abated -- but Chicago's police and city leaders, particularly Rahm Emanuel, still face a lot of criticism for not doing enough. Opinion:  It's not Emanuel's fault that Chicago is divided . McCarthy, a regular on CNN's original series ""Chicagoland,"" has admitted that the city ""has one of the worst, most difficult, most intractable gang violence problems in the country."" And he's made it clear that his top priority is ""dealing with gangs, guns and the press."" ""The media, they keep talking about the rising toll of gun violence in Chicago while the numbers are going in the other direction,"" McCarthy said last year.","More than 40 people were shot over Easter weekend in Chicago .
Nevertheless, the city's homicide rate is trending downward, police chief says .

"Beijing (CNN) -- One of China's most prominent activists and his wife are under house arrest and have been beaten by authorities, two human rights groups, China Aid and Chinese Human Rights Defenders said Friday. In a home video released Wednesday by U.S.-based rights group China Aid, Chen Guangcheng described the dire and frustrating conditions of his house arrest, since he was released from jail in September. He said police have threatened to throw him back in jail without recourse. ""I've come out of a small jail and entered a bigger one (house arrest),"" Chen, 39, said in the video, wearing sunglasses and a black jacket. ""Those people stand at the four corners of my house and spy on my family and monitor what we do ... floodlights have been installed around my house and surveillance cameras."" Vehicles surround his home, and his land line and mobile phone have been cut off. Chen said anyone in the community who attempts to help him is threatened by the authorities. ""My house is basically under surveillance 24 hours a day and we can't get out of the house and the same thing happens to my wife,"" described Chen. ""Only my mother can go out to get something for us to eat and stay alive."" On Friday, the Hong Kong-based China Human Rights Defenders reported Chen and his wife Yuan Weijin were severely beaten after the public release of the video showing Chen discussing his house arrest at home. ""According to our source, the beating was not light but also was not life threatening,"" Wang Songlian of China Human Rights Defenders told CNN in a phone interview. Calls to local authorities went unanswered. Chen and his wife have not been allowed to visit a hospital or see a doctor, the organization said. Cheng has been ill for several months now with an intestinal infection and he has not been able to seek medical attention, according to CHRD. ""What they do now is is what I call thuggery,"" Chen said in the video. ""First they provoke you through various means and stir up trouble. After all, no matter how they beat me, the judicial organs will turn a deaf ear since it is done on the order of the Party Committee."" Chen is a well-known activist in China. In 1998, he led farmers in Yinan County, where his hometown is located, to protest against a river-polluting paper factory and persuaded an international donor to fund a deep well for drinking water as alternative to the polluted river water. He later set up a center for rights of the handicapped and filed a case against a public transport company in Beijing for refusing to honor the law providing free rides to them. Chen brought class-action lawsuits on behalf of families impacted by China's enforcement of family-planning laws, which limit couples to one child. After his years of activism, the People's Court of Yinan County sentenced Chen to four years and three months in prison in August 2006 on charges of ""willfully damaging property"" and ""organizing a mob to disturb traffic."" Chen's supporters called the charges preposterous. Last month, in the lead up to Chinese President Hu Jintao's visit to the United States, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for the release of Chen, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, along with other political prisoners who are ""enduring enforced disappearances.""","Chinese activist under house arrest is beaten, human rights groups say .

"Even by MIT standards, says Tom Leighton, Danny Lewin was special. ""He was really exceptionally smart. MIT has a lot of really smart people, and Danny stood out even among that rarified environment,"" says Leighton, who was then one of Lewin's professors at the Massachusetts school's computer science laboratory. ""He liked working on the hardest problems, as opposed to the easier ones, because they would make more of a difference."" That kind of determination drove Lewin throughout his short life. He was an American who joined the Israeli army and served in an elite unit, though he could have avoided the military altogether. He was a mathematician who could have had a stellar academic career but decided to jump into business. Most importantly, in the late '90s he saw a solution to what was then called the ""World Wide Wait"" and, with his company Akamai Technologies -- co-founded with Leighton -- made the Web faster and more efficient. (Disclosure: CNN was an early Akamai client and remains one to this day.) Lewin died on September 11, 2001, at age 31. He was on American Airlines Flight 11, the first plane to hit the World Trade Center, and was almost certainly the first person killed in the attacks on that horrible day. His life is now the subject of a new biography, ""No Better Time: The Brief, Remarkable Life of Danny Lewin, the Genius Who Transformed the Internet."" If you've never heard of Lewin, you're not alone, says the book's author, Molly Knight Raskin. That was partly due to his low-profile life and business -- Akamai is an infrastructure company, and Lewin wasn't flashy with his instant dot-com millions -- and partly because his friends and family shied away from publicity. But she believes it's a life that deserves to be celebrated. Even at 31, she says, he'd already accomplished so much. There were so many different elements, she says -- his military service, his business leadership, his intellect, his savvy -- and she wanted to convey some of that energy to others. ""It was about the way he lived,"" she says. ""I felt like if he was motivating me as much, I felt like I could do the same for readers."" 'Like lighting a fire' From the beginning, Lewin seemed destined for big things. Even as a child he was an accomplished violinist, performer and athlete. He loved computers, too, learning to program an Apple II his father brought home in 1979. He was 9. In 1984, his family decided to move to Israel, and Lewin grew up near Jerusalem. He often spent as much time weightlifting as on his schoolwork, the book notes; nevertheless he aced his classes while developing an enviable physique. The latter would serve him well when he joined the Israel Defense Forces and tried out for the Sayeret Matkal, the secretive unit known for the famed 1976 rescue raid on Uganda's Entebbe Airport. Israel was key to shaping Lewin's temperament, says Raskin. ""Moving to Israel was like lighting a fire under (his) drive,"" she says. ""He wanted to squeeze every last drop out of every minute out of every hour out of every day."" The imprint of the country's intensity and its people's blunt manner were obvious to anyone who met him years later. Some Akamai colleagues found him abrasive, and Lewin -- who had a fondness for words -- joked about being ""obstreperous."" But he was also terrifically loyal, supportive of staff and worked as hard as anybody. ""He was motivating, so if he did kick you in the butt and tell you to work harder, generally people responded very well to that,"" Leighton recalls. ""People wanted to 'take the hill' if he was saying that's what we've got to do."" It was enough to impress Leighton, the academic who says in the book that he would have been perfectly happy to spend the rest of his life solving proofs. What attracted him to enter the private sector was ""a chance for us to make a difference in the real world,"" he says in a phone interview. ""In the area where we worked, in algorithms and the theoretical side of computer science, often that work is good, deep work, but it doesn't change the world. It doesn't impact people directly,"" adds Leighton, now the CEO of Akamai. ""With this work, we thought it would have relevance in the real world, and make the Internet be faster, more reliable, more secure. It was a chance that was pretty rare for us."" 'His potential was limitless' You have to remember that the Web we use today -- with practically instantaneous results, broadband-fueled streaming video and at-your-fingertips devices -- was practically unimaginable when Akamai was founded in 1998. Back then, with dial-up access and overworked servers,  a page load could be as interminable as the drip of molasses. And so Akamai -- the name comes from the Hawaiian for ""smart"" or ""clever"" -- was born. But even with its killer app, which lowered the possibility of crashing servers, there was no guarantee of success, even in the late-'90s dot-com era. Indeed, Akamai's first attempt at impressing the venture capitalists who fund such dreams, the MIT $50K Entrepreneurship Competition, fell short. That only pushed Lewin to work harder. The company struck pay dirt on an unlikely day, March 11, 1999. That Thursday two events shook the Web: The opening of the NCAA men's basketball tournament and the first streaming of the trailer for ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace."" While servers crashed all over the country, Akamai-supported machines handled the surge, and the company started taking off. The next two years were boom and bust -- for the Internet and for Akamai. In the aftermath of the company's October 1999 IPO, Lewin and Leighton were briefly paper billionaires. The stock scaled $300 a share. Then came the crash of 2000. Dozens of dot-com companies folded. By 2001, Akamai stock was selling for less than $5. Leighton says Lewin never lost his concentration. ""We were both pretty focused on getting the job done, and that was true whether the stock was at 350 bucks or 50 cents,"" he says ""It was positive reinforcement. If one of us got worried about a problem, the other would step in and say, here's how we're going to get past this one and here's why it's going to work out."" 9/11 . Nevertheless, things were particularly grim on September 10, 2001. Leighton remembers a session stretching late into the evening in which the executives had to decide whom to lay off, including some friends and colleagues who had been with them almost since the beginning. The next morning Lewin had to fly from Boston to Los Angeles. ""He probably barely got an hour of sleep before getting on board the next morning,"" Leighton remembers. Lewin was sitting in seat 9B. With his Israeli military training and understanding of Arabic, he may have figured out what was going on, perhaps even tried to stop it. According to flight attendants' calls relayed to authorities on the ground, the first passenger to be killed was seated in 9B. He was stabbed to death. Friends have always pondered the what-ifs. Lewin may have finished his Ph.D., something that always nagged at him. Friends thought he could have entered Israeli politics. Or he could have become a high-tech household name, like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs. ""Those who knew him feel like the world was robbed,"" says Raskin. ""He was always searching for something greater."" Leighton, who helped keep Akamai going in the dark days after Lewin's death, wonders as well. Akamai has since become a multibillion-dollar company active in cybersecurity. Perhaps Lewin would have gone that direction, using both his mathematical mind and his military training to fight terrorism. We'll never know. ""I think he could have done whatever he decided he wanted to do,"" says Leighton. ""I think his potential was limitless.""","Danny Lewin was a math genius who co-founded Akamai Technologies .

I want to make sure that it's clearly something my fellow Americans want me to do."" The conservative activist announced last month he was forming a political action committee, One Nation PAC. He reiterated Monday, as he has said previously, that he'll wait to see the midterm results in November before he makes a final decision. ""Unless the American people indicate in November that they like big government intervention in every part of their lives, I think the likelihood is strong,"" he said, when asked again whether he'll run for the Republican presidential nomination. He said he would make his decision before May, a later time frame than other potential candidates have signaled. 'Crossfire': Is Ben Carson qualified to be president? Pressed on whether Carson, who has little political experience, could break past what could possibly be a crowded GOP field of candidates, Carson said, ""I've been talking all of my life."" ""And I will continue to talk. You know, I will never be a politician. I will tell you that right of the bat,"" he said. Carson became popular in conservative circles in 2013 when he criticized Democratic policies on taxes and health care while giving the keynote address in front of President Barack Obama at the National Prayer Breakfast. He has a strong grassroots following. In the past year, Carson has made headlines for making inflammatory comments, such as comparing Obamacare to slavery and the United States to Nazi Germany. He also withdrew from two speaking gigs after facing protests over his comments about same-sex marriage.","Dr. Ben Carson says there's a ""strong"" chance he'll run for president in 2016 .

"Thursday could be a key moment in the future of time keeping. More than 100 countries are due to decide on whether to keep the present method of adding so-called leap seconds to the global time system at the Radiocommunications Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland. Currently, this Co-ordinated Universal Time or UTC is based on a system of extremely accurate atomic clocks. But they are so precise that they do not match the rotation of the Earth which periodically speeds up and slows down due to the action of the tides and changes within the Earth's core. Since 1972 these extra seconds are added or taken away from the timescale to make sure UTC is synchronized with the Earth's rotation. Fifty years ago, a few seconds difference had less impact but many of our 21st century devices depend on incredible accuracy. Peter Whibberley, senior research scientist in the Time Group at the UK's National Physical Laboratory, explains that people like astronomers also rely on this level of precision. ""There are many applications today that depend on precise time keeping. For example, telecommunications use atomic clocks to keep the networks around the world synchronized precisely together,"" he said. ""Satellite navigation -- sat navs in our cars and homes -- depend on signals being sent out from atomic clocks on board satellites."" But now many countries, including the U.S. and most European nations, want to abandon the procedure which they say is too cumbersome. According to Whibberley, precise timing systems can be disrupted by altering them. The UK, Canada and China are pressing to keep the leap seconds when the issue is discussed at the U.N.'s International Telecommunications Union meeting on Thursday. ""Without a correction, eventually our clocks would show the middle of the day occurring at night,"" said Whibberley. ""We have to have some means of making a correction but at the moment no one knows how that's going to be done."" Since 1972 Whibberley said only 24 leap seconds have been used and the rate has slowed because the Earth has been speeding up over the last few decades. Without the leap seconds adjustment, the precise time measured by atomic clocks and time according to the Earth's rotation will start to deviate. Although the tiniest inaccuracies might play havoc with our smart phones most of us would not notice the changes in our body clock -- it is estimated it will take more than 200 years to register an hour's difference.","More than 100 countries are discussing whether to keep the addition of leap seconds to the global time system .

"A university student cowers in a pharmacy as a mob outside threatens her with sexual violence. A law student is groped by her classmates, the dean cites her ""inappropriate attire."" Frightening allegations but advocates say this is an everyday reality for women in Cairo. Habiba is a college student. CNN is only using her first name to protect her identity. She readily recalls the day a group of men chased her down the street. ""Come on! You know they want to,"" they shouted at her, while making lewd gestures she said. Finally she ducked into a pharmacy but found no refuge inside. ''No one in the pharmacy did anything to help me despite my pleas, they just wanted me to leave,'' Habiba said. Habiba says the men wouldn't leave but after two hours like this, she got tired of waiting. So she ran. Fast. ''I was so afraid that one of them would touch me ... you just don't forget something like that,'' she said. Incredibly, Habiba says this kind of thing happens to her daily. And she's not alone. A 2013 United Nations report entitled ""Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women"" found that 99.3% of Egyptian women have experienced some form of sexual harassment. The statistic shows how widespread the problem is, the stories get at the horror these women face. Last month, a group of male students groped one of their female colleagues. Crying, she shut herself in the bathroom. Only when the men laid siege outside the bathroom did the university's security move to accompany the girl safely off campus, according to witnesses. The university's dean, Gaber Nassar, blamed the woman for her ''inappropriate attire'' on a local talk show last month. He said that she was wearing a black cloak that she took off as she entered the university. A YouTube video showed what she had on underneath: a long sleeved pink shirt, black pants and bleached blond hair. He later retracted his comments on his official twitter account, apologizing for the misunderstanding and denying the victim would be reprimanded. ''We will not relent in the punishment of these harassers,'' he added. Habiba said it doesn't matter what women wear. ''Even veiled girls get harassed all the time,"" she said. ""It's a lack of ethics and culture more than anything.'' But some say the women themselves need to be doing more to change the culture. Colonel Manal Atef, a female member of an Egyptian interior ministry task force set up to tackle violence against women, says the problem of harassment lies not with the state or the laws, but with women not taking action to report crimes. For example, she says, the law student did not file a complaint to the authorities. Naglaa Al-Adly runs the research and studies department at the National Council for Women (NCW). She told CNN: ''The problem is very difficult because the women and girls themselves don't take an action for these assaults. They feel ashamed.'' Some women, including Lyla El-Gueretly, are speaking up. Last year she says she was harassed in Cairo by a 37-year-old man. She says he catcalled her and made sexual gestures. El-Gueretly stood up to him and said, ''Shame on your beard,'' referring to his beard, which is perceived as a sign of piety in Islam. She says he then got angry, followed her and then slapped for having the audacity to talk back to him. She said he thought it was ""his right (to sexually harass me).'' Eventually other passers by intervened to stop her attacker, and she convinced them to take him to the nearest police station. ''The (people) tried to talk me out of taking him to the police station,'' El-Gueretly told CNN. ''They said it's just a waste of time, a waste of effort and he has learned the lesson.'' Ultimately the attacker was arrested and charged with assault.  But the prosecution released him before trial.  He was tried in absentia, and found guilty.  To this day he walks free. El-Gueretly is frustrated that despite the court order, her attacker remains at large, and the verdict hasn't been implemented. ''They (the authorities) are telling women 'you're on your own,' and they're saying to the harassers 'we're not going to punish you,''' she said. Colonel Atef insists that women are at the top of the interior ministry's priorities. She argues that sexual harassers often leave the scene quickly, making it difficult to catch them. Atef's unit  was established in 2013 to face the mounting incidents of sexual harassment and violence against women. It consists of four female police officers who have been trained in the United States on how to ''face crimes of sexual harassment and implement them in Egypt,"" according to Atef. ''To make things easier for the victim, we have three telephone lines and we work 24 hours a day. We have a fax and an e-mail, so there is constant contact with victims,'' she said, adding that they offered legal advice, as well as psychological and social support. NCW's Al-Adly, however, said that despite the interior ministry's efforts and cooperation, four female officers in a population of more than 86 million isn't enough. The NCW had been pushing the government to quickly pass a draft law they proposed in early June 2013 that would combat violence against women, include harsher sentences against sexual harassers and a specific definition for sexual harassment.  But Atef explained to the organization that the term ""sexual harassment"" is not explicitly covered under Egyptian law. Justice Ministry spokesperson Abdel Azim al-Ashry told CNN the ministry's human rights department is working to finalize a modified version of NCW's anti-sexual harassment law and have it approved by the country's president. The draft law, intended to target sexual harassment, states that if one perpetrator is found responsible for actions that have sexual or pornographic overtones, or stalks, gestures or speaks in a way that violates a female in public or private, he could be detained for at least one year and/or fined up to US $2,800.  If more than one perpetrator is involved, they would also be fined and could be detained for up to seven years. If the perpetrator is armed or is the victim's boss or someone who has authority over the victim, the offender could be detained for up to seven years and fined up to US $2,800. Al-Ashry cited the current instability in the country and the absence of parliament, which is responsible for legislation, as reasons for the delay in implementing such a law -- although interim President Adly Mansour does have the power to issue laws unilaterally until a parliament is elected. Yet Mansour issued a law in November 2013 imposing more restrictions on protesters.  NCW's Al-Adly argued that a law protecting women should be just as important. Al-Adly and Colonel Atef say they will continue to encourage Egyptian women to fight for their rights and speak out against the perpetrators. They also aim to encourage men to honor and respect women. In the meantime, Egyptian women like Habiba will continue to struggle with sexual harassment from day to day.  ''I don't feel safe and there's nowhere to go,'' she said.","A U.N. report found 99.3% of Egyptian women have experienced some form of sexual harassment .
Advocates say this is an everyday reality for women in Cairo .

"(CNN) -- Thailand's people are justifiably proud of their country, which, sandwiched as it is between historically powerful neighbors, has managed skillfully to play off its rivals and retain its independence. Known as the ""land of smiles"" to tourists but the ""land of freedom"" to those born in the country once known as Siam, its astute line of Chakri dynasty monarchs in the 18th and 19th century managed to juggle competing French and British colonial interests in the region. Thailand, as a result, is the only country in Southeast Asia that was never colonized by a European power. In the 20th century, Thailand's independence has brought with it challenges that are still being resolved despite its rise to the forefront of the region's emerging economies. According to the World Bank, it is now second-largest economy in Southeast Asia after Indonesia. The 86-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej has been the head of state of Thailand for more than six decades. During the country's often-turbulent political history, he has acted as a force for continuity and tradition even when the country has lurched between political crises and military coups. From 1946, when he acceded to the throne, to the present, Bhumibol has reigned through more than 20 prime ministers, 17 military coups and 17 constitutions and steered the country through the destabilizing effects of the nearby Vietnam War during the 1960s and '70s. Over the years, the king has intervened periodically in political crises, using his influence to try to defuse situations that threatened to destabilize the country. For much of the first few decades of Bhumibol's reign, the running of the country was dominated by the Thai military and a bureaucratic elite, according to the U.S. State Department. Governments replaced one another through ""a long series of mostly bloodless coups,"" it said. The painful and slow transition towards a more democratic government began in the 1970s. That process is still continuing today. Coups and continuation . From 1992 until this year Thailand is generally considered to have functioned as a democracy, according to the U.S. State Department. However, the current government is one run by the military and two military takeovers have occurred in the country since 2006. The first, a coup in September 2006, ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and installed an unelected government for more than a year. Since then, pro-Thaksin forces -- whose ""red shirt"" supporters are largely drawn from the rural north of the country but also enjoy support from urban intellectuals -- have periodically engaged in large-scale protests. ""Yellow shirt"" opposition supporters have also taken to the streets in high numbers. There have been clashes, the most violent with security forces â€” the worst of which was a crackdown by security forces on red shirts in 2010 that left dozens dead. A series of anti-government protests and sporadic violent clashes on the streets of the capital Bangkok began in November 2013. In May this year, after months of civil unrest, Yingluck Shinawatra --Thaksin's sister -- was removed as prime minister after a Constitutional Court ruled that she had illegally transferred a government official. Later that month the Thai army enacted a coup and declared martial law. The general who led the coup, General Prayuth Chan-ocha is the current prime minister of an interim government. He was the sole candidate for the post and was selected by the country's National Legislative Assembly. Members of the assembly were chosen by Prayuth; more than half are also in the military. Economic growth . At the core of Thailand's current political fault line is the country's changing economic dynamic. Of the many changes that Thailand has undergone since Bhumibol came to the throne, the growth in the nation's economy is considered to be the most spectacular. Largely agrarian when he came to power, Thailand has since become an industrial and services sector giant in the region. It remains one of the world's top rice producers, is one of the world's most popular tourist destinations and is a regional manufacturing hub for the auto industry and for hi-tech electronics. However, with the largely rural and once-impoverished northeast of the country now at the center of a boom, its growing middle class in the rural region have been calling for greater political representation. Economic growth in the northeast Isaan region hit 40% between 2007 and 2011, compared with 23% for the rest of Thailand over that period and just 17% for greater Bangkok, according to government figures. Isaan, which once exported people to Bangkok and the rest of the world as cheap migrant labor, is seeing its workers return. While the World Bank predicts that Thailand is on track to meet most of its Millennium Development Goals -- including eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, and improving maternal health -- income inequality and a lack of equal opportunities persist, especially between Bangkok and the rest of the country. With an official unemployment figure of less than 1% of the population, Thailand could be seen as a model for other Southeast Asian countries. Yet the plight of the country's estimated two to three million migrant workers -- most of whom are from neighboring Myanmar and fill many low-paid, manual labor jobs -- has gained international attention. Most migrate willingly, but in June this year the U.S. downgraded Thailand to tier 3, the lowest level, in its annual Trafficking in Persons report. The downgrade means that Thailand has not met minimum standards in combating illegal migration and human trafficking and not made significant efforts to do so. In a letter to CNN, the Thai government said, ""Thailand has been actively combating human trafficking and the issue remains a top priority for the current administration."" Acknowledging the downgrade, they added, ""Thailand will continue to do our utmost to combat human trafficking and illegal migration."" Another ongoing challenge for the country is the Muslim separatist movement in the south of the country. Over 90% of Thailand's population is classified as Buddhist, yet in the southern regions of Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat and Songkhla there is a Muslim majority -- Thailand government statistics put Thai Buddhists at just 6% of the region's population. Muslims there have complained this Buddhist minority dominates the region, and many Muslim hardliners view the education system as a tool of Thai colonialism. As such separatist groups have operated in the region for over 10 years, according to NGO Deep South Watch, that monitors the conflict. These politically motivated groups often target security officials and Thai government operations. According to the U.S. State Department, in March 2014, at least 50 violent incidents killed more than 30 people in these provinces; Deep South Watch put the cumulative deaths from related conflicts at around 5,500. The Thai government has stated in a letter to CNN that ""the problems in the Southern Border Provinces of Thailand have no direct linkage to religions ... [and] no direct linkage to any separatist movements.""","Known as ""land of smiles"" to visitors, ""land of freedom"" to many Thais .

"Philippine military helicopters on Monday fired rockets at Muslim rebels who were holed up in areas of a major city on the southern island of Mindanao. The rebels have been holding scores of people hostage in Zamboanga City for the past week in a crisis that authorities estimate has left as many as 61 people dead and more than 150 wounded. No truce: Army, Islamic militants fight on in Philippines . Intense exchanges of gunfire continued to take place Monday as military officials said they were trying to tighten the noose around rebel-held areas. Two MG-520 attack helicopters from the Philippine Air Force fired rockets at rebel positions over a roughly 20 minute period in the early afternoon, the official Philippine News Agency reported, citing military officials. The recent violence has largely paralyzed Zamboanga, a usually bustling trading hub on the southwestern tip of Mindanao, and displaced more than 60,000 people. The crisis has increased fears of instability in a region where the central government is pursuing a new peace plan after decades of unrest. President Benigno Aquino III and other top Philippine officials are overseeing the response in Zamboanga, a mainly Christian city. The Philippine armed forces are carrying out an operation to try to ""constrict"" the rebels, who came ashore last Monday, said military spokesman Lt. Col. Ramon Zagala. He described the operation as ""delicate,"" as the troops try to avoid harming hostages and any other civilians caught in the parts of Zamboanga where the rebels are holed up. The rebels now hold one third of the territory they had last week, before the military began its effort to squeeze their positions last Friday, Zagala said. The armed forces switched to a more offensive approach after the rebels fired mortars into civilian areas, he said. More than 100 hostages . Military officials say they believe that slightly more than 100 rebels remain active in Zamboanga and that they are still holding more than 100 people as a human shield. Some hostages and other civilians trapped in the rebel-held zone have managed to flee during outbursts of fighting over the past week. Security forces estimate that they have killed 51 rebels, although only 21 bodies have been recovered. A further 48 rebels have been captured and nine have been wounded, Zagala said. The violence has killed six members of the Philippine security forces and four civilians, he said. The number of people estimated to have been wounded, including rebels, stands at 157. The unrest in Zamboanga has closed schools and businesses. Hundreds of houses of houses have caught fire during the fighting. Authorities have accused the rebels of deliberately starting the fires. The rebels are a faction of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), a separatist movement founded in 1971 by Nur Misuari with the aim of establishing an autonomous region for Muslims in the mainly Catholic Philippines. The MNLF signed a peace deal with the central government in Manila in 1996, but some of its members have broken away to continue a violent campaign. Last month, Misuari issued a ""declaration of independence"" for the Moro nation -- referring to Mindanao's indigenous Muslim population -- after complaining that the MNLF had been left out of a recent wealth-sharing agreement with another insurgent group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which has fought for decades to set up an independent Islamic state on resource-rich Mindanao.","The helicopters carry out a 20-minute attack on rebel positions in Zamboanga City .

"(CNN)At the rate Marvel is going, all of its comic book characters will have their own movie, maybe two. ""Ant-Man"" is the latest to join the studio's movie superhero ranks. Marvel just unveiled the trailer this week. The character is little-known outside of hardcore fans, much like last summer's ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" franchise, which turned out to be a big hit. Playing Ant-Man is Paul Rudd, an actor largely known for his comedic chops. Rudd's character, the troubled Scott Lang, is recruited by Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), to wear the shrinking Ant-Man suit. A keen sense of humor might be just what's needed for this superhero, who becomes teeny tiny, but powerful, in his pursuit of justice.

"(CNN) -- The Cannes Film Festival entrusted its opening to a Pixar film, and the animation studio did not disappoint. An adventurous boy and a cranky man travel by unusual means in the new Pixar film ""Up."" Pixar, which has produced such gems as ""Toy Story,"" ""The Incredibles"" and ""WALL-E,"" introduced its latest feature, ""Up,"" on Wednesday night at the French movie celebration. By critics' reckonings, Pixar has never released a bad film, and those who saw ""Up,"" its 10th feature, say the studio's perfect record is still intact. The film is a ""captivating odd-couple adventure that becomes funnier and more exciting as it flies along,"" wrote Variety's Todd McCarthy. ""The two leading men are 78 and 8 years old, and the age range of those who will appreciate the picture is even a bit wider than that.""  Gallery: Pixar in pictures » . ""It's a terrific family adventure,"" wrote Peter Bradshaw of Britain's The Guardian. ""The 3-D presentation gives it a real boost, but this film is airborne because of the traditional strengths: story, characterization and inventive animation with the old-fashioned values of clarity and simplicity.""  See the excitement of Cannes' opening » . ""Up"" concerns Carl Fredericksen, a balloon seller voiced by Ed Asner. Faced with eviction after his wife dies, Fredericksen decides to uproot himself -- literally -- by attaching hundreds of balloons to his house and flying it to South America. However, it turns out he's not alone. A stowaway -- a Junior Wilderness Explorer named Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) -- is in the house as well, and the two of them become mutually dependent after landing a continent away. The film opens May 29 in the United States. Cannes audiences are notoriously vocal. They'll whistle if they're unhappy -- a French version of a boo -- and a movie that doesn't meet the audience's high standards will be treated to the repeated ""whop"" sounds of theater seats banging shut as patrons leave. ""Up,"" on the other hand, received little but cheers. CNN's Natasha Curry, who's at the festival, reports a morning screening concluded with applause. It's an unlikely film to be opening Cannes. Not only is it animated, it's animated by computer -- and, in some theaters, it will be shown in 3-D. Those are all firsts for a Cannes curtain raiser. But the Los Angeles Times' Kenneth Turan told CNN that ""Up"" fits in with Cannes' aspirations. ""Cannes likes to be seen as innovative, likes to be seen as embracing something new,"" Turan observed. ""But really the reason 'Up' is opening the festival is not because it's animated, not because it's 3-D, it's ... because it's a wonderful film. [Festival organizers] saw that, and I'm sure they liked the fact that they could do something avant-garde in terms of technique, but really it's a wonderful story, it's a terrific film and that's why it's opening."" Turan said he sees Pixar's work, and its recognition by Cannes, as another sign that animated features are among the best films being produced right now. ""The Pixar films, the Hayao Miyazaki films from Japan, the Wallace and Gromit films from Britain -- we're really living in the golden age of animation, one of the great ages of animation in the whole history of film,"" he said. ""And Cannes is happy to be part of that. Cannes is happy to recognize that."" CNN's Matthew Carey contributed to this report.","""Up,"" new film from Pixar, opens Cannes Film Festival .

"The Pentagon tried to clarify remarks made by Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, when he told a Senate committtee on Wednesday that the U.S. military is seeking ""permission"" from a foreign organization to intervene in Syria. ""He was re-emphasizing the need for an international mandate. We are not ceding U.S. decision-making authority to some foreign body,"" a defense official told CNN. In testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Panetta had an exchange with Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, who said Congress was circumvented when Obama decided to join the NATO coalition in Libya. Sessions said, ""We spend our time worrying about the U.N., the Arab League, NATO and too little time, in my opinion, worrying about the elected representatives of the United States. As you go forward, will you consult with the United States Congress?"" Panetta replied, ""You know, our goal would be to seek international permission. And we would come to the Congress and inform you and determine how best to approach this, whether or not we would want to get permission from the Congress."" Latching onto the words ""permission"" and ""inform,"" Sessions ripped into Panetta: ""Well I'm troubled by that. I think it does weaken the ability of the United States to lead. I do think ultimately you need the legal authority from the United States of America, not from any other extra-territorial group that might assemble."" But even when Sessions gave Panetta a chance to clarify, Panetta continued to say the U.S. would seek ""permission"" so that there was a legal basis to act. ""I'm really baffled by the idea that somehow an international assembly provides a legal basis for the United States military to be deployed in combat,"" Sessions said. ""I don't believe it's close to being correct. They provide no legal authority. The only legal authority that's required to deploy the United States military is of the Congress and the president and the law and the Constitution."" After the exchange, committee chairman Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, tried to help Panetta clarify further. ""I don't think the word permission is appropriate even in that context. By the way, I think what -- you really corrected it when you said a legal basis in international law would help you achieve an international coalition,"" Levin said. ""That's correct,"" Panetta responded. After the hearing, Sen. Sessions told Security Clearance in an interview that Panetta's comments were ""very revealing of the mindset"" of the administration. Panetta ""seemed so natural in expressing it as if he didn't understand this went against"" the fundamentals of our government. While Sessions said he does not think the U.S. should act alone, he said there are indications that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is gaining momentum and ""the window of opportunity could be closed."" ""The delays that are taking place out of a determination to get a major worldwide support, I suppose could be costly,"" Sessions said in the interview. The defense official, who did not identify himself because he did not want to speak publicly for the secretary, further explained the rationale for seeking international agreement. ""The legitimacy is greater if there is some form of international mandate. There's a sense that unilateral U.S. action would be perceived in the wrong way, especially in this part of the world. Does the U.S. want to go it alone in another Arab country? That figures into the calculus."" The official said a United Nations Security Council resolution, like the one that authorized action in Libya, isn't necessarily the only way to go about this. ""Some kind of mandate from a regional organization could signify this is not just a unilateral effort on our part,"" he said. This is important not only to the U.S., but to other nations in the region that oppose al-Assad's regime, the source said. The official also emphasized that international agreement is just one of the concerns. The other part of the equation is the Syrian military and dense population centers, which are big factors in any military intervention, said the source. ""The complexity of that cannot be overstated. This is a very hard problem set we're dealing with.""","Panetta had an exchange with Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama .

"Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday he hoped for better ties with the United States in a July Fourth message to his U.S. counterpart, Barack Obama. The Independence Day wishes come at a time when relations between the two nations are at their lowest ebb since the Cold War, fueled by tensions over Russia's actions in Ukraine. According to the Kremlin website, Putin ""expressed a hope for the successful development of the relationship between both countries, based on equal rights and utilitarianism, despite all the difficulties and disagreements they are facing at the moment."" Putin also said that since the two nations are responsible for global security, they ""should cooperate in the interests of not just their own people, but the entire world."" He urged the building of a bilateral relationship based on ""mutual respect"" and understanding of each other's interests. Moscow has repeatedly complained that the West has not taken its legitimate interests in Ukraine into consideration or treated it as an equal partner. The White House gave a muted response to Putin's gesture. ""We've seen the message but have no particular comment,"" said National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden. The United States and European Union have imposed targeted economic sanctions on Russian individuals and companies in response to Moscow's actions in Ukraine. Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in March despite condemnation from the West. Its amassing of troops along the border with Ukraine has led to heightened tensions. The EU and the United States have repeatedly warned Moscow that more economic sanctions could be imposed if it doesn't act to defuse the crisis. In a bid to end the pro-Russia separatist unrest roiling the east of his country, Ukraine's new President Petro Poroshenko has proposed a peace plan that calls for the rebels to lay down their arms and engage in talks.

"Abortion rates in the United States are at their lowest in 40 years, according to a new report from the Guttmacher Institute. In 2011, the U.S. abortion rate was 16.9 abortions per every 1,000 women aged 15 to 44, the lowest it's been since abortion was legalized in 1973. Between 2008 and 2011, the abortion rate fell 13%, resuming the downward trend that had stalled between 2005 and 2008. Abortion rates stall after decade-long decline . ""The decline in abortions coincided with a steep national drop in overall pregnancy and birth rates,"" Rachel Jones, lead author of the study, said in a statement. ""Contraceptive use improved during this period. ... Moreover, the recent recession led many women and couples to want to avoid or delay pregnancy and childbearing."" The study, ""Abortion Incidence and Service Availability in the United States, 2011,"" is available online and will be published in the March issue of the journal Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health. As Jones said, several variables affect abortion rates, including the economy, access to contraception and the availability of abortion services. The pregnancy rate is the lowest it has been in 12 years. It's possible that since there were fewer overall pregnancies, there were also fewer unintended pregnancies during this time period. Both could be attributed to an uptick in more effective contraception use, the study authors say. U.S. women having fewer children . Previous studies have shown that offering free contraception to women may prevent abortions.  Longer-term methods, such as intrauterine devices, are as much as 20 times more effective at preventing unintended pregnancies than methods that require constant action, such as the birth control pill or vaginal ring. ""Access to a range of birth control methods is playing an important role in reducing unintended pregnancy and decreasing the need for abortion,"" Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement. ""This report comes just as some politicians and corporations are trying to make it harder for women to get birth control by chipping away at the historic benefit in the Affordable Care Act that requires insurance plans to cover birth control without a copay."" Women's access to certain types of abortion providers also matters, the study authors say. In 2011, abortion clinics represented just 19% of facilities offering abortion services. Yet clinics performed approximately 63% of the procedures. The researchers concluded that ""the number of clinics in particular may be a more important indicator of access than the total number of providers."" The total number of abortion providers declined 4% between 2008 and 2011, according to the study. The number of clinics declined 1% nationwide, with much higher rates of decline in Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Oklahoma and Vermont, which each lost one clinic. Although one clinic closure may seem insignificant, it may have contributed to the larger-than-average decline in the abortion rates in Kansas and Oklahoma, the study authors say. Study: '16 and Pregnant' led to fewer teen births . An estimated 239,400 early medication abortions were performed in 2011, 20% more than in 2008. The vast majority -- 98% -- were done using Mifepristone, more commonly known as RU-486. Mifepristone was approved in 2000 in the United States. It is used to block the hormone progesterone in women who are up to nine weeks pregnant. ""Heavy promotion of RU-486 and chemical abortions has really had an impact,"" Randall K. O'Bannon, director of education and research with the National Right to Life Committee, told CNN in 2011. ""(Women) would consider abortion when they might not consider it before."" National Right to Life recently released its own report on ""The State of Abortion in the United States,"" which states that more than ""3,000 unborn children are still killed every day."" The anti-abortion organization says the recent drop in the abortion rate can be attributed to legislative efforts at the state and federal levels. ""Abortion remains widely available. But after years of being told that abortion was 'the best choice' or 'their only choice,' women are learning that there are alternatives to abortion that affirm their lives and the lives of their children,"" President Carol Tobias said in a statement. ""The bottom line is simple: the right-to-life movement is succeeding because even after 41 years and more than 56 million abortions, the conscience of our nation knows that killing unborn children is wrong."" Abortion Fast Facts . Between 2008 and 2010, 44 laws related to abortion were implemented in 18 states, according to the report. Most did not likely have an effect on the abortion rate, the study authors say, but a few may have. For example, a new law in Missouri that requires a woman to attend an in-person counseling session 24 hours before an abortion may have attributed to the state's 17% decline. An additional 62 laws related to abortion were passed in 2011. Most did not go into effect until October, the study authors say, so it's unlikely they had an effect on the report's numbers. However, they may contribute to a change in abortion rates in the future. ""Over the past three years, we have seen an unparalleled attack on abortion rights at the state level, and these new restrictions are making it harder for women to access services and for providers to keep clinic doors open,"" Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager at Guttmacher, said in a press release. ""As we monitor trends in abortion going forward, it is critical that we also monitor whether these state restrictions are preventing women who need abortion services from accessing them."" Opinion: Let's get real about abortions . The Guttmacher Institute study does have its limitations. The study authors were unable to get in touch with every abortion provider, and some providing early medication abortions may have been missed. ""As welcome as news of this decline is, more information is needed,"" said Chuck Donovan, president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute. ""The Guttmacher data is based on completely voluntary reporting by abortion providers. Until we have consistent reporting requirements, inclusive of states with high abortion rates and gathered by publicly accountable bodies, we cannot begin to paint a complete picture of U.S abortion trends.""","Abortion rates are at their lowest since 1973 when it was legalized .

"(CNN)His name isn't as recognizable as Michael Brown's. But like Brown, Ezell Ford was an unarmed black man shot and killed by police in August. Now, newly released details of Ford's death could raise a host of new questions. Among the findings: The 25-year-old was shot three times, including once in the back. And that wound was surrounded by a muzzle imprint, Ford's autopsy report shows. But ""there is nothing in the coroner's report that is inconsistent with the statements given to us by the officers,"" Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said. Ford was shot by Los Angeles police on August 11 -- two days after Brown was killed. The Los Angeles County coroner's office released the autopsy Monday after the Los Angeles police removed its security hold on it. The LAPD had put an administrative hold on Ford's autopsy because the department said it wanted witnesses to come forward before the autopsy's release. What happened? The circumstances leading up to Ford's death aren't exactly clear. According to one of the officers involved, he and Ford got into a ""violent struggle,"" Beck said. Ford ended up on top of the officer, with Ford in control of the officer's pistol, the police chief said. ""The officer drew his backup gun and reached over Mr. Ford's back and shot Mr. Ford in very close proximity -- possibly, probably the cause of the muzzle imprint that's mentioned in the coroner's report,"" Beck said. Ford's family has said he was mentally ill and unarmed. The police chief said the investigation is far from over. ""We continue to seek the public's assistance. Any information regarding this incident will help us complete this picture,"" Beck said. He said police have not been able to reach any civilian witnesses who actually saw the shooting. ""We still are searching for witnesses. We still are looking for other versions of events."" He said the district attorney will make the final determination about whether the shooting met legal standards. Before the autopsy's release, a Los Angeles community leader wondered how the shooting could be justified. ""How do you explain when you have this level of deadly force against those that are not even accused of committing a crime and are not even armed?"" asked Earl Ofari Hutchinson of the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable. The two officers involved have been assigned to non-field duties as the investigation continues. CNN's Cheri Mossberg and Stephanie Elam contributed to this report.","Ezell Ford was shot in the back, with a muzzle imprint in his skin .

"If the Gaza truce holds and Israel's Operation Protective Edge comes to its conclusion, some things are certain. Both Israel and Hamas will declare military victory -- Israel pointing to the destruction of militants' tunnels and depletion of Hamas' rocket supply; Hamas pointing to dozens of dead Israeli troops and the survival of Hamas leadership in Gaza. But unlike in previous conflicts, when Hamas had the support of many Arab nations, things have changed. This time, as CNN has reported, the fighting between Israel and Hamas has been a proxy war for the Mideast. Key regional players Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia have their own reasons to want to fend off the Muslim Brotherhood, of which Hamas is part, experts say. And Europe, like the United States, lists Hamas as a terrorist organization for its numerous attacks on civilians. But the group does have the support of some countries. ""It's no longer the Muslims against the Jews,"" said Danielle Pletka, vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. ""Now it's the extremists -- the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, Hezbollah, and their backers Iran, Qatar and Turkey -- against Israel and the more moderate Muslims including Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia."" A look at some key Hamas supporters: . Turkey . Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan openly supports Hamas. ""Erdogan has tried to use the cause of the Brotherhood to bolster his own Islamist credentials at home,"" says Eric Trager, of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Turkey also has ""more of an ideological sympathy with the Brotherhood,"" Trager says. Qatar . Qatar supported the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt -- which was toppled from power in a coup last year. Qatar funds many Muslim Brotherhood figures in exile, including Hamas political leader Khaled Meshaal, who is believed to have orchestrated numerous terrorist attacks. ""Qatar has a long history of providing shelter to Islamist groups, amongst them the Muslim Brotherhood and the Taliban,"" Shashank Joshi of the Royal United Services Institute tells Time. Advocating for Hamas is beneficial to Turkey and Qatar in their political objectives because the cause draws popular support at home, says world affairs writer Frida Ghitis in a CNN.com column. But some question whether Qatar's support for Hamas is still strong. The country's financial support to the group ""largely dried up"" as Qatar sought ""to mend ties with its neighbors, with whom it had fallen out in part for backing the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt,"" the Council on Foreign Relations said. While Qatar and Turkey are powerful allies, ""Hamas might wish for more support given the breadth of the Arab world,"" Time reported. Iran and Syria . In the past, Iran and Syria supported Hamas. Iran supplied the group with weapons; Syria was home to Meshaal. But Meshaal did not support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the country's civil war. In 2012, Meshaal left for Qatar, causing a breakdown in his relationship with both Syria and its ally Iran, says Firas Abi Ali, head of Middle East and North Africa Country Risk and Forecasting at the global information company IHS. And while Iran still professes to support Hamas, such claims ""are more ostentatious, showy, exaggerated and theatrical rather than genuine and practical,"" writes Majid Rafizadeh, an Iranian-American scholar at Harvard University, in a column for al Arabiya. Iran, which is a Muslim but not an Arab nation, ""uses Hamas (as well as Tehran's support for the Palestinian cause) as a tool to project its power and influence in the Arab world,"" he argues. The Council on Foreign Relations says Iran, while cutting its funding to Hamas in recent years, ""sought to bolster its ties to other resistance groups in the region, such as Islamic Jihad."" Hezbollah . The Lebanese militant group based in Lebanon is aligned with al-Assad's regime in Syria. During the conflict, Hezbollah reached out to Hamas, praising its ""steadfastness."" This does not mean the relationship is repaired to where it stood before Syria's civil war, but ""a new realignment might happen,"" Farwaz Gerges of the London School of Economics told Time. Popular support . Hamas' greatest support in the wake of the conflict with Israel may be from the public in Gaza and other parts of the Arab world. ""Hamas is not a monolith, nor is it only a terrorist group,"" Ed Husain of the Council on Foreign Relations writes on CNN.com. ""It is a social movement, with a mass membership, a popular message of resistance that resonates across the Muslim world, and a political party with which we must negotiate."" Some analysts believe Hamas will emerge stronger from the fight with Israel. The conflict ""will only further radicalize the Palestinian population -- and alienate frustrated friends in the United States,"" Mark Perry of Foreign Policy argues. Before Operation Protective Edge, a poll by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy found that most Palestinians in Gaza oppose a two-state solution and want to work toward abolishing Israel -- a goal that is in line with Hamas' charter. But the poll also found most Palestinians support nonviolent methods of achieving their goals. Support could affect arms supply . While Hamas' recruitment might soar now, militarily the group ""is on the ropes,"" with tunnels destroyed and much of its rocket supply depleted, writes Rick Francona, retired U.S. Air Force intelligence officer and CNN military analyst. ""After similar conflicts in the past, Hamas has been rearmed and resupplied by its supporters, primarily Iran and to some extent Syria. The most efficient method for the rearming and resupply effort has been via the large number of smuggling tunnels between Gaza and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. ""That is not likely to be the case this time -- another blow to Hamas, which it must factor in to its assessment of this conflict as well as its future planning."" What is Hamas' endgame in Gaza? What is Israel's endgame in Gaza?","Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia don't support Hamas, analysts say .
Turkey and Qatar do; some question the extent of Qatar's support .
Iran and Syria had a falling out with Hamas .
Popular support may spike, but weapon supply is limited, analysts say ."

"Shain Gandee, one of the stars of the MTV reality show ""Buckwild,"" and two other people died of carbon monoxide poisoning, the sheriff's office in Kanawha County, West Virginia, said Tuesday. The deaths, discovered Monday, were labeled as accidental, according to preliminary findings from an autopsy report. Gandee, 21, was found dead in a vehicle along with his uncle, David Dwight Gandee, 48, and Donald Robert Myers, 27, authorities said. ""This is a very sad and tragic event,"" Kanawha County Commissioner Kent Carper said Monday. ""We live in a very small community. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Gandee family."" On Monday, the sheriff's office said they had ""received word of a disabled vehicle in a wooded area"" near Sissonville, that deputies and Sissonville Volunteer Fire Department personnel used all-terrain vehicles to reach the 1984 Ford Bronco belonging to the Gandee family. Inside the MTV show 'Buckwild' ""Inside were the bodies of three people,"" the sheriff's office statement said. Later, the sheriff's office said the vehicle was partially submerged in mud. It was uneven but upright; its muffler was below the surface. Mud covered the lower part of the Bronco's passenger side door, but the driver's side, where the younger Gandee sat, was free. Shain Gandee was one of the nine cast members of ""Buckwild."" The show follows a group of young adults trying to have fun in Sissonville, pulling stunts such as turning a dump truck into a swimming pool or just riding around the woods on their ATVs. Gandee was billed as a former high school prom king who had done ""every job from coal mining to being a garbage man."" MTV released a statement about Gandee: ""We are shocked and saddened by the terrible news about Shain Gandee, and those involved in this tragic incident. We are waiting for more information but at this time, our main concern is for the Gandee family and their friends. Our thoughts and prayers are with them. Shain had a magnetic personality, with a passion for life that touched everyone he met and we will miss him dearly."" Some of Gandee's fellow cast members took to social media to express their feelings. ""RIP Shain Gandee,"" Ashley Whitt tweeted. ""You were the most amazing person I've ever known. I know you will be watching over ..."" ""This is the emptiest I've ever felt,"" Cara Parrish tweeted. ""Please pray for Dale and Loretta [Gandee's parents]."" ""Buckwild"" has been compared to MTV's reality show ""Jersey Shore,"" and on Monday, one of that show's stars, Jenni ""JWoww"" Farley, tweeted, ""That's awful that shain passed... He was just a baby. Rip. #Buckwild.""","Shain Gandee was one of nine cast members of the MTV reality show ""Buckwild""

"Until this week, no cases of human-to-human transmission of the deadly bird flu virus that broke out in China this year had been reported. But now, researchers say they believe a woman in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi probably caught the H7N9 virus from her father. The woman, 32, most likely became infected when she was looking after her father at his bedside in the hospital in March, according to a study published Tuesday in the British Medical Journal. Both patients eventually died. The woman had no known exposure to poultry, the study said. ""Our findings reinforced that the novel virus possesses the potential for pandemic spread,"" the study's authors wrote. But in the case they studied, they said ""the transmissibility was limited and non-sustainable."" In April, the World Health Organization warned the H7N9 virus was ""one of the most lethal"" that doctors and medical investigators had faced in recent years. The virus has caused 132 human infections resulting in 43 deaths since February, Chinese state media reported last month. The rate of infections seen earlier this year has dropped off dramatically.

"Night gathers, and now your watch begins. You step into the elevator and take a last look around the courtyard of Castle Black before a bone-rattling ride lifts you 700 feet, depositing you in the whipping wind of the frigid north, high atop The Wall. Then, as the red flames of torches flicker in the distance, you hear two telling blasts from the watchmen's horns. The wildlings are coming. For thousands of ""Game of Thrones"" fans, that brief immersion into the life of a Night's Watch soldier in the HBO show is becoming a reality this week, thanks to an exhibit at the South by Southwest Interactive festival that employs one of the hottest gadgets in tech. ""Ascend the Wall"" is part of a traveling exhibit promoting the wildly popular fantasy epic, which returns for its fourth season next month. It's built using Oculus Rift, a virtual-reality headset that has captured the imaginations of gamers since its $2.4 million debut on Kickstarter in 2012. Designed specifically for video gaming, the Rift provides a 360-degree field of vision, allowing wearers to view, and react to, their surroundings in a realistic manner. The device's capabilities were inspiring to Mike Woods, creative director of Framestore, the London-based visual-effects company that developed ""Ascend the Wall."" ""It's whatever you want it to be,"" said Woods, whose company recently scored an Academy Award for best visual effects for ""Gravity"" and has another for 2008's ""The Golden Compass."" ""They know that they're reinventing gaming,"" he added. ""There are, literally, endless possibilities."" At the exhibit, which also featured props, costumes and other ""Game of Thrones"" displays, visitors lined up, sometimes for several hours, for a turn in a bank of booths designed to look like the elevators that carry soldiers on the show's massive, icy wall. Once inside, they're fitted with the Oculus Rift and a set of headphones, and the experience begins. The visuals are built using a gaming engine, and the booth's floor and walls are equipped with rumble packs that help create the illusion of movement. A set of air vents complete the experience, flicking on and off to cool the temperature and give the sense that the wearer has, indeed, exited the elevator into a howling wind above. The end result is impressive. Rift's full field of view makes it difficult not to keep looking over your shoulder, expecting an unpleasant surprise. And when it moves you to the edge of the wall, it's a challenge to not instinctively scramble back, despite intellectually knowing you're standing still in an Austin music hall. Oculus made at least one big fan with the exhibit: Actor Kristian Nairn, an avid gamer who also happens to play gentle giant Hodor on ""Game of Thrones."" ""I was excited to try the Oculus Rift ... Wasn't ready for the awesome,"" Nairn wrote on Twitter after checking it out on Saturday. ""I'm telling you, if you are excited about it, (it's) better than you hope!"" In another post, he said he was picturing how the Rift could be used with games such as ""Skyrim"" and ""World of Warcraft."" ""They will be perfect for it,"" he wrote. Naim wasn't the only one singing its praises. Many of those who waited in a long line to test out the Oculus seemed similarly wowed. ""The Oculus experience at the #GOTExhibit is ridiculously good,"" tweeted Andy Kinsella, executive producer at Google Creative Lab. ""Wanted it to last for hours."" The fourth season of ""Game of Thrones"" kicks off April 4. Merging a popular cable TV series with cutting-edge technology appeared to be a winning combination at South by Southwest, where the first five days of the 10-day festival are devoted to film and digital culture. At times, the wait to get into the exhibit itself (never mind the Oculus experience) was more than two hours. And festival organizers said that, as of Sunday, ""Game of Thrones"" was the ninth-most popular topic in tweets that also mentioned South by Southwest. Assange to SXSW: We're all being watched .

"(Mashable)  -- After retiring the floppy disk in March, Sony has halted the manufacture and distribution of another now-obsolete technology: the cassette Walkman, the first low-cost, portable music player. The final batch was shipped to Japanese retailers in April, according to IT Media. Once these units are sold, new cassette Walkmans will no longer be available through the manufacturer. The first generation Walkman (which was called the Soundabout in the U.S., and the Stowaway in the UK) was released on July 1, 1979 in Japan. Although it later became a huge success, it only sold 3,000 units in its first month. Sony managed to sell some 200 million iterations of the cassette Walkman over the product line's 30-year career. Mashable.com: Sony retires the floppy disk . Somewhat ironically, the announcement was delivered just one day ahead of the iPod's ninth anniversary on October 23, although the decline of the cassette Walkman is attributed primarily to the explosive popularity of CD players in the '90s, not the iPod. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"Neil Diamond will donate royalties from his song ""Sweet Caroline,"" which has been played at every Boston Red Sox home game for more than a decade, to the One Fund Boston, the singer said on Twitter on Wednesday. The song was downloaded more than 19,000 times this week, with sales up 597%, Nielsen SoundScan said. Diamond told Rolling Stone earlier this week that he will write a song about the bombings and other tragedies. ""I'm writing now and obviously affected by this situation in Boston, so I'm writing about it just to express myself,"" he told the magazine. Diamond was at Fenway Park on Saturday to lead the crowd in what has become a stadium tradition of singing the tune during the break in the eighth inning before the Sox come to bat. ""What an honor it is for me to be here today. I bring love from the whole country,"" he told the Sox faithful. The singer recorded the song in 1969 as an homage to Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of the late President John F. Kennedy. It has nothing to do with the Red Sox. According to the Boston Globe, Amy Tobey, who chose the music played at games, is responsible for bringing the tune to Fenway. In 2002, new management requested the song become an eighth-inning staple. The fund has raised more than $23 million as of Wednesday. The fund was formed to ""help the people most affected by the tragic events that occurred in Boston on April 15, 2013,"" the website says.","Singer will donate royalties to help people affected by the bombings in Boston .

"While their countrymen prepared to attend to the Olympic ideals of ""citius, altius, fortius"" -- faster, higher, stronger -- two Russian thrillseekers traveled to China to put at least one of those to the ultimate test by scaling the as yet unfinished Shanghai Tower in the city's financial district. The climbers were the same men who made headlines last year when they scaled the Great Pyramid at Giza, Egypt -- and later apologized when they were accused of disrespecting the ancient monuments. They recorded their exploits in Shanghai with forehead-mounted cameras, and the resulting footage, which shows their adrenaline-fueled journey from break-in to summit, is breathtaking. The video, uploaded to video sharing site Vimeo, shows two masked men wearing hoodies talking urgently in Russian as they scope out the boarded-up construction site, before slipping in. Under the cover of darkness, they make their way up to the roof of the skyscraper. The climbers, Vadim Makhorov and Vitaly Raskalov, aren't new to this type of extreme freeclimbing. Their blogs show images of climbers clambering over sites including buildings, mines and dams across Europe, the Middle East and Central and East Asia. Makharov's blog shows a climber with a camera atop one of the pyramids outside Cairo. Raskalov told CNN that he was ""not scared"" when climbing this kind of structure, although it was an ""usual situation"" for him to undertake this kind of climb. Peering over the side, the upper floors of the distinctive, 492m Shanghai World Financial Center and the neighboring Jin Mao Tower (421m) can be seen in the video, peeking through low lying clouds. From their vantage point on top of the unfinished building, Raskalov and Makharov look down on the skyscrapers -- the height of the new construction dwarfing its neighbors, which had previously dominated Shanghai's skyline. Undaunted, the pair then swing out onto a crane and continue clambering skywards. Cutting back and forth between the daredevils as they ascend the crane, the wide angled cameras show the yawning chasm beneath their sneakered feet -- neither man appears to wear any safety gear. Upon reaching the very top of the crane, one examines his hands, grimy from the long climb, and the pair high-five each other before taking the ultimate Facebook profile pic - one unlikely to ever be replicated. The 2073 ft (632 m) Shanghai Tower, when completed, will be the second -tallest in the world, after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. When the crane jib climbed by the men is factored in, the total height scaled is estimated to be 650m. Makhorov's blog says that the pair waited until the Lunar New Year holidays, when construction teams had left the site.","Russian thrillseekers climb unfinished skyscraper in Shanghai .

"The death of a transgender woman who was beaten in New York is being investigated as a hate crime, authorities said. Islan Nettles, 21, was attacked in the early morning hours on August 17. She died Thursday as a result of ""blunt impact head injuries,"" said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner's office. The death has been ruled a homicide, Borakove said. Paris Wilson, 20, was arrested the same day as the attack and charged with two counts of third-degree assault and one count of second-degree harassment. Wilson allegedly hit Nettles on the head ""with a closed fist,"" causing the victim to fall to the ground. Once on the ground, he allegedly continued to strike Nettles in the face. A police officer reported that he observed Nettles ""unconscious on the ground with a swollen shut eye and blood on her face,"" according to a criminal complaint. The attack occurred in Harlem, just across the street from the station office of Police Service Area 6, which patrols public housing developments in the neighborhood. Nettles was pursuing a degree in fashion marketing, and hoped to work in the industry after graduation, according to her LinkedIn page. She and friends were reportedly the targets of hateful and discriminatory language at the time of the attack. ""They were called faggots, they were called he-shes, she-males, things of that nature,"" Dolores Nettles, the victim's mother, told CNN affiliate WABC. CNN's request for comment from the suspect's attorney was not immediately returned. Wilson remains out on bail.

"Editor's note: John King, CNN's chief national correspondent and ""State of the Union"" host, examines the news made in Sunday talk and offers up this Monday morning crib sheet on what to watch this week in politics. Please note that all quotes are from rush transcripts and are subject to change. If you'd like to receive a sneak peek of next week's news in your inbox every Sunday, you can sign up for the ""Political Ticker newsletter"" at http://www.cnn.com/profile/ . CNN's John King looks back at Sunday's talk shows and what will make news in the coming week. (CNN) -- And amid all the talk, there was notable silence: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi decided not to appear on any of the Sunday shows to defend herself after a rocky week. For Pelosi, last week included a concession that she had been briefed about the use of waterboarding back in 2003 and an accusation the CIA had deliberately misled her and Congress about Bush era interrogation practices. Health care, the economy and the path to a GOP comeback were also hot topics, not to mention the controversy over President Obama's commencement address at Notre Dame. With Speaker Pelosi declining offers from ""State of the Union"" and others to answer questions on Sunday, her Republican critics stepped into the vacuum -- with gusto. Pelosi's critics fire away . ""Lying to the Congress of the United States is a crime. And if the speaker is accusing the CIA and other intelligence officials of lying or misleading the Congress, then she should come forward with evidence and turn that over to the Justice Department so they can be prosecuted. And if that's not the case, I think she ought to apologize to our intelligence professionals around the world."" -- House Minority Leader John Boehner on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Read more of Boehner's comments . ""I think the reality here is that Nancy Pelosi has stepped in it big time. And she is now put the Democratic Party in a position, where the question for me is, does the president support Nancy Pelosi's versions of what happened, or his CIA director's versions of what happened."" -- Republican National Committee Chair Michael Steele on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" For all the criticism of the Democratic speaker, there was clearly little desire on the part of some Republicans to seek an investigation that might damage Pelosi but would definitely put the spotlight on Bush administration officials and the interrogations of terror suspects. ""I am less interested in investigating whether her memory is correct or she lied about it than I am in the policies that flow from the debate that we're having. I am not one who thinks we ought to have truth commissions and all of the rest of it and keep looking backward. I agree with the president. We've got enough on our plate, we need to look forward."" -- Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, on ABC's ""This Week"" Supreme battle ahead . One certain issue for this week is the president's search for a Supreme Court nominee. Conservatives are putting pressure on leading Republicans to prepare for a confirmation fight, and while the math overwhelmingly favors the Democrats, the Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell said it was too soon to rule out a filibuster, a tactic he condemned during Bush administration court debates. ""I think it is way premature ... to be predicting what kind of procedural moves will be taken when we haven't even seen the nomination yet."" -- Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on ""Fox News Sunday"" Cheney: Help or hindrance? Former Vice President Dick Cheney was not out on the Sunday talk shows, but there was a lot of debate over whether he's helping or hurting the Republican Party with his harsh criticisms of the Obama administration. The criticisms have been coming hard and fast ever since his first TV interview on ""State of the Union"" on March 15. Read more about criticisms, reaction . One of his staunch defenders was his daughter: . ""The future of the Republican Party is going to be built based on substance. And a key part of that substance is a strong national defense. The national security piece of it is one on which the [former] vice president has in fact been very effective in the debate over the last two weeks. Not just in influencing public opinion but frankly influencing the Obama White House."" -- Republican strategist Liz Cheney on ""This Week"" Read more of Liz Cheney's comments . The latest on Guantanamo . The concept of Republicans ""influencing the White House"" relates to two recent dramatic reversals of policy: refusing to release additional photos of interrogations and considering trying Guantanamo detainees in military commissions instead of civilian criminal courts. The debate on what to do with the detainees continued Sunday: . ""They should be transferred to established criminal courts, courts that have been able to handle such cases. ... We have the capacity.

And I think he is beginning to learn how difficult it is to govern. You know it's one thing to campaign and to make statements. But when it comes to governing, there has to be much more pragmatic decisions.

We do have more work ahead."" -- Peter Orszag, director of the Office of Management and Budget, on ""State of the Union"" President at Notre Dame . Another big Sunday story was Obama's commencement speech at Notre Dame University -- speaking directly to those who protested his presence at the Catholic institution. ""When we open our hearts and our minds to those who may not think like we do or believe what we do -- that's when we discover at least the possibility of common ground. ... That's when we begin to say, 'Maybe we won't agree on abortion, but we can still agree that this is a heart-wrenching decision for any woman to make, with both moral and spiritual dimensions."" -- Obama at Notre Dame University. Read more about Obama's visit . On ""State of the Union,"" two political contributors, conservative radio talk show host Bill Bennett and Democratic strategist James Carville, had very different views of this event: . Bennett: Yes, he should be welcome on the campus. Yes, he should be able to come and express his views. Should he receive an honor for his views? No, he should not. When you go against fundamental moral principles, fundamentally teachings of the church, then you should not be honored. Should there be a debate on campus on this as there can be, sure. Carville: If Notre Dame is serious ... this is what they need to do: They need to get every member of the faculty, particularly the law school -- I understand that there are law school professors teaching at Notre Dame that say Roe v. Wade is set law. ... Why don't they go through and see if their biology teacher -- see if anybody on that faculty is pro-choice? Bennett: Missing the point. Carville: I'm not missing the point. It's much more relevant to a university what a teacher is teaching in the classroom than somebody gets an honorary degree. I know people who have gotten 40 honorary degrees. That's another issue. Are you willing to have them go and make every law professor sign a statement saying that they overturn Roe v. Wade? How can you teach students that? Bennett: Free inquiry at the university is entirely appropriate. But the point of honoring someone who is the most pro-abortion president for his life and his work is inappropriate. I have one of those honorary degrees from Notre Dame, by the way. It ain't worth much. On a lighter note . Minority Leader Boehner was the butt of one of President Obama's best lines at the recent press dinner: . ""In the next 100 days, our -- my partisan outreach will be so successful that even John Boehner will consider becoming a Democrat. After all, we have a lot in common. He is a person of color. Although not a color that appears in the natural world."" -- President Obama . Boehner took the joke about his deep tan in stride: . ""You know, as I tell my friends, you only tease the ones you love. And, you know, if the president wants to go out and take a walk with me, as I do every day, or I walked 18 holes yesterday. Last weekend I was in Ohio cutting my grass, trimming my beds, I enjoy being outside. But I'd rather be heckled than ignored."" -- John Boehner.

"(CNN)Rafael Nadal says he's unsure if he will play at this month's Australian Open after slumping to defeat in the opening round of the Qatar Open in Doha. The world No. 3 was dumped out of the season opener by 34-year-old German qualifier Michael Berrer 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 in a match lasting a little under two hours. Nadal, who defeated Gael Monfils in the final 12 months ago, admitted to being nervous in his first tour match since undergoing appendix surgery last November. ""I was playing with more nerves than usual. I knew that winning a couple of matches here will help me, so that makes me play a little bit more under more tension,"" Nadal said, the ATP Tour website reported. His second defeat inside a week -- Nadal lost in straight sets to Andy Murray at an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi on January 3 -- has cast doubt in his own mind if he is ready for the season's opening grand slam in Melbourne which gets underway on January 19. ""This is the third comeback of my career after injury, so we will see how it goes in a couple of months. I wanted to start well, but it was not the case today,"" Nadal said, Agence France-Presse reported. ""I also want to play in the Australian Open which is a tournament I like a lot. I don't know if that will be the case either, but I am going to work for it. If not I will be playing at Rio and Buenos Aires (ATP Tour clay court tournaments taking place in February). ""The season is long. After coming back from injury you can't see the immediate moment, you have to look further ahead a little bit."" After suffering a back injury in last year's Australian Open final defeat to Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka, and missing the U.S. Open in September with a wrist injury, Nadal could be forgiven for being cautious about his return. Tsonga out of Melbourne . While Nadal's participation remains in doubt, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga will definitely not be in the draw for Melbourne. The 29-year-old Frenchman, who reached the final in 2008, has yet to recover from an arm injury sustained during France's defeat to Switzerland in the Davis Cup final last November. ""It is with great disappointment that I have to postpone today the start of my season, pulling out of the Australian Open,"" Tsonga said Wednesday. ""I'm still suffering from a forearm inflammation (intersection syndrome) and that prevents me from being at full capacity."" There seem to be no such health worries for world No. 1 Novak Djokovic who was forced to withdraw from last weekend's final against Murray in Abu Dhabi with a fever. The Serb cruised through his opening match in Doha, seeing off his compatriot Dusan Lajovic 6-2 6-1 in 59 minutes.

"(CNN) -- Former South African President Nelson Mandela toiled for 27 years in South African prisons before gaining his freedom and leading his nation from white minority rule to full democracy. In the process, he became an international symbol of strength and hope. Mandela became South Africa's first black president in 1984. This month he celebrates his 90th birthday with a lavish, star-studded concert in London that confirms his enduring status as a revered global icon. But his journey from young protester to political prisoner to leader of his nation has not been without heartache and personal loss. Mandela was born in 1918 in the South African village Qunu. He was the son of the chief councilor to a Thembu chief, and he soon became passionate about political reformation, founding the African National Congress Youth League in 1944 with lifelong friend Oliver Tambo. Mandela's natural leadership skills pushed him front and center during the ANC's 1952 Defiance Campaign, which urged South African citizens not to cooperate with certain laws deemed discriminatory. Mandela urged nonviolent solutions to the South African government's political, economic and social oppression of the nation's black majority. His commitment to nonviolent change was tested, however, in March of 1960 when black protestors in the township of Sharpeville were fired upon by South African police as they gathered to protest a law that required all black citizens to carry passbooks at all times. Sixty-nine people were killed and more than 180 were injured in the clash. The Sharpeville Massacre sparked riots, strikes and protest demonstrations across South Africa, and the government declared a state of emergency. But the massacre also highlighted the tragedy of apartheid to the rest of the world. The United Nations condemned the massacre, and its security council convened on April 1, 1960, to consider the ravaging effects of apartheid on South Africa's people. Inside the country, Mandela and his colleagues reconsidered the use of violence to further their cause for freedom. Mandela formed the revolutionary group Spear of the Nation In 1961 and was named its commander in chief. He slipped out of South Africa for military training in Algeria in 1962 but was arrested soon after he returned.  See pictures of Mandela's life » . Mandela had several previous run-ins with police, and he was eventually sentenced to life in prison for his actions protesting South Africa's apartheid government. At the time of his sentence Mandela made a dramatic statement that illustrated his overarching commitment to freedom: ""During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to the struggle of the African people,"" he said. ""I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But, if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.""  Listen to famous speech » . During his long incarceration, Mandela nearly became a myth. He smuggled out notes of encouragement to his followers that read like pronouncements. ""Any man or institution that tries to rob me of my dignity will lose,"" one note said. He might have been condemned to hard labor in a limestone quarry, but Mandela's unyielding moral stance held him high on a pedestal to his followers. In 1990, it became clear to then-South African President F.W. de Klerk that Mandela's release was necessary for the nation to heal. Mandela was 71 years old when he walked free from Victor Verster prison, his clenched fist held high. He'd lived a life of protest for a cause for which he'd been prepared to die. And now he would lead a nation on the brink of civil war to democracy. Three years later, de Klerk and Mandela would share the Nobel Peace Prize. ""The policy of reconciliation that Nelson R. Mandela and Frederik Willem de Klerk represent provides hope not only for South Africa; it is also a shining example for the world that there are ways out of the vicious circle of violence and bitterness,"" said Francis Sejersted, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee as he awarded the shared prize. In 1994, Mandela was elected president in South Africa's first all-race general elections. Since his retirement in 1999, Mandela has turned his attention to international diplomacy: He convinced Libya to hand over two suspects for trial in the Lockerbie airplane bombing, and he played a role in the Burundi peace process. In 2005, he took up a personal cause closer to home. Mandela's son, Makgatho Mandela, 54, died of an AIDS-related illness. Nearly 5 million South Africans may have AIDS, medical experts estimate, and for many in the country discussing the disease is a taboo. ""Let us give publicity to HIV/AIDS and not hide it, because the only way to make it appear like a normal illness like TB, like cancer, is always to come out and to say somebody has died because of HIV/AIDS,"" Mandela said in January at a news conference where he announced his loss. ""And people will stop regarding it as something extraordinary."" On Mandela's 80th birthday he wed his 52-year-old companion, Graca Machel, from Mozambique at a private ceremony in his home in Johannesburg, South Africa. He danced at the double celebration surrounded by his grandchildren, family and close friends.","Mandela born in 1918 in the South African village Qunu .

"Republicans will unveil a rebranding effort Thursday aimed at changing its image as a political party focused solely on obstructing President Barack Obama's agenda to instead a champion of ideas and action. It is being spearheaded by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who will deliver a speech at a local university outlining the GOP's legislative efforts across 11 topic areas ranging from jobs and national security to values and immigration. ""If you asked the country, most people would say they know our party opposes many of those policies,"" Priebus is expected to say about the GOP's view of Obama's legislative goals, according to an early draft of his remarks obtained by CNN. ""We oppose them because we know there's a better way. ""So before November, I wanted to take a moment, cut through the noise, and talk about what's driving the Republican Party. People know what we're against. I want to talk about the things we're for."" Obama spotlights economy in midterm message . The plan is to arm surrogates and candidates with detailed information to emphasize in cable television and talk radio appearances and on the campaign trail about what the GOP has accomplished in Congress as well as discuss the party's vision. Some of the subjects include legislation by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul to address unemployment, efforts by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Utah Sen. Mike Lee to eliminate the marriage penalty and an immigration plan that emphasizes stricter security along the borders. This new push by Republicans to change their image comes one month before the midterm elections in which the GOP is expected to easily hold its majority in the House and perhaps take control of the Senate. CNN Poll: Big swing for Democrats but not where they need it . Despite the predictions by nonpartisan political handicappers of GOP electoral success in November, there is an acknowledgment within the party that it needs to do a better job convincing voters that its objective is greater than just derailing Obama's agenda. It was just one year ago when Republican opposition to the new health care law -- otherwise known as Obamacare -- forced the federal government to shut down for several weeks. Many Republicans acknowledge the shutdown hurt the GOP's image with voters frustrated by Washington inaction and dysfunction. The ability to demonstrate it can govern effectively is essential for both political parties over the next two years, as it will set the stage for what is discussed, attacked and promoted in the 2016 presidential campaign. It is no secret that the conservative grassroots have been hypercritical of the GOP establishment in recent years over the direction of the party, execution of ideas and decision to protect incumbent Republican lawmakers who do not meet the grassroots definition of a full-blooded conservative. An RNC official said that this plan was drafted after soliciting extensive input from political and grassroots activists, campaign operatives and elected officials over the past several months about what messages needed to be highlighted.","Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus is spearheading the plan .

"New census figures released Thursday for America's white and black populations depicted a nation where most people are white, with increasing numbers of mixed-race inhabitants. While the number of white residents increased in the past decade, the total fell as a percentage of the overall U.S. population, according to figures from the 2010 census. Meanwhile, the number of black Americans increased, with those identifying themselves as being of mixed black and white descent more than doubling in the past 10 years, Census Bureau officials said. Most blacks continue to live in Southern states, though changing population dynamics appear in other parts of the country, particularly the Pacific Northwest and the Southwest, the census figures showed. Of the total U.S. population in 2010 of just under 309 million people, 231 million were white, or almost 75%. A decade earlier, the white population was about 217 million, or 77% of the almost 282 million total then. In addition, the white population grew at a slower rate -- 6% -- over the past decade than the total population, which increased by almost 10%, according to census officials. Much of the 14 million increase in the white population -- 74% -- involved whites of Hispanic origin, as the census distinguished Hispanic ethnicity from race. For example, respondents could identify themselves as white Hispanics, black Hispanics or as Hispanics in any of the other racial categories. Meanwhile, the number of whites not identified as Hispanics also increased in total from 195 million in 2000 to about 197 million in 2010 but decreased as a percentage of the total population, from 69% in the previous census to 64% in last year's survey. ""It's not surprising that we're seeing that the growth of the white population is due to Hispanics identifying as whites,"" said Lindsay Hixson, a statistician for the bureau's racial statistics branch in the population division. People identifying themselves as mixed-race whites increased by 2 million over the decade. Most of the increase was people who reported their race as both black and white, a group that rose to 1.8 million last year, compared with 785,000 in the 2000 census. The 130% increase was the largest by percentage among any group or subgroup in the white or black populations, the census information showed. A total of 42 million identified themselves as black alone or in a combination with other races, comprising 14% of the total U.S. population. According to the latest census, white Hispanic populations showed the greatest increase in the Pacific Northwest, parts of California, the Southwest, Texas, Florida and the Northeast. Black populations also increased in the Pacific Northwest, California, the Southwest, Florida and the Northeast but decreased in many Southern states. Despite those decreases, more than half of the black population still lived in the South, the 2010 survey showed.","The U.S. Census Bureau releases more figures from the 2010 survey .

"(CNN)Some of the U.S. military personnel being deployed to Liberia to help tackle the Ebola crisis may come into contact with the virus, a Pentagon official said Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference, the head of U.S. Africa Command, Gen. David Rodriguez, said that while the majority of U.S. troops involved in the mission would not be exposed to the disease, those in mobile testing labs could have contact in that environment. ""They're all trained at a very, very high level,"" Rodriguez told reporters of the lab personnel, who constitute a ""separate, specialty element of the force."" The Pentagon has sent three of these mobile labs to Liberia so far, and expects to send more in the coming months, according to Rodriguez. Each mobile lab is staffed by three or four service members, a fraction of the overall military presence in the country. Last week, Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby told reporters there was ""no expectation"" that U.S. troops would be ""physically, geographically in a situation where that they should be exposed"" to Ebola, though he admitted that risk to lab technicians is higher than the troops. On Tuesday, Rodriguez emphasized that, ""the health and safety of the team supporting this mission is our priority."" ""We will do everything in our power to address and mitigate the potential risk to our service members, civilian employees, contractors and their families,"" he said. If a service member contracts Ebola while in Liberia, Rodriguez said they would be flown to the United States in a specially outfitted plane to a facility equipped to handle their case. Three American civilians who have so far contracted the disease while in West Africa were similarly evacuated. But the Pentagon insists they are taking all necessary precautions to keep personnel from becoming infected. Troops are completing special training before they deploy and will have to follow strict protocols in the field, which include frequent washing of hands and feet, as well as temperature-taking. They will also have to fill out questionnaires on their physical condition and any symptoms they might be experiencing. Up to 4,000 U.S. military personnel have been approved for deployment in this effort, which Gen. Rodriguez said would cost an estimated $750 million over a six month period.","Some U.S. personnel could be in contact with Ebola in West Africa, Pentagon official says .

"(CNN) -- A former Ford Motor Co. employee pled guilty on Wednesday to two counts of theft of trade secrets, handing them over to a Chinese competitor. Federal prosecutors in a U.S. District Court in Detroit, Michigan, say Xiang Dong Yu -- a 49 year-old former product engineer at Ford -- used his company access to steal trade secrets. Yu admitted to copying 4,000 internal company documents -- including sensitive Ford design plans -- prior to his departure from Ford, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's office for Michigan's Eastern District. He then went to his new employer's office -- Beijing Automotive Co. -- in Shenzhen, China, bringing the stolen trade secrets with him, the statement said. Yu returned to the United States in October 2009, it said, where he was arrested by FBI agents who searched his computer and discovered 41 Ford design specification documents. Under a plea agreement, Yu faces at least five years in a U.S. prison and fines of up to $150,000, the statement said. ""We will vigilantly protect the intellectual property of our U.S. automakers, who invest millions of dollars and decades of time in research and development to compete in a global economy,"" U.S. Attorney Barbara L. McQuade said in the statement. ""Those who do not play by the rules will be brought to justice."" Yu's defense attorney David DuMouchel declined to comment. Yu is currently in federal custody and will face sentencing early next year.","Former Ford employee pled guilty to two counts of theft of trade secrets .

"(CNN) -- Two of Pakistan's key supporters in the U.S. Congress have acknowledged ""real and serious questions"" about Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan, but defend sending money to that country nonetheless. During a Senate hearing Wednesday assessing the limits of U.S policy in Pakistan, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry, D- Massachusetts, said that although he is ""curious"" about whether components of Pakistan's military or intelligence services were involved in protecting the compound's infamous resident, the U.S. should not rush to judgment that might ultimately hurt its national security. ""No matter what we learn about the events that preceded the killing of Osama bin Laden, we still have vital national security interests in this region, and we have worked hard to build a partnership with Pakistan, fragile and difficult and challenged as it may be at times,"" Kerry said. Committee Ranking Member Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, said that recent events have raised questions about Pakistan's reliability as an ally, but cautioned that it is ""a strategically vital country with which we must engage."" ""Distancing ourselves from Pakistan would be unwise and extremely dangerous,"" Lugar said, because it would weaken U.S. intelligence capabilities, limit America's ability to prevent conflict between India and Pakistan, and further complicate military operations in Afghanistan. Lugar also pointed out that Pakistan is a nuclear-armed state, has a close working relationship with China, and is a neighbor of Iran, all of which he cited as worthwhile reasons to build stronger relations between Washington and Islamabad. The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009, also known as the Kerry-Lugar-Berman Act, authorizes $1.5 billion in annual aid to Pakistan through 2013. Critics question what that money is paying for. ""Pakistan acts very irrational,"" committee member Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, said. ""I mean, I leave there almost feeling like I've had a Rodney Dangerfield moment, you know, whenever I'm there."" Corker advocated that the United States ""rearrange"" its relationship with Pakistan to focus on routing out the remnants of al Qaeda and other terrorist groups inside the country. Hearing witness Moeed Yusuf, South Asia advisor at the U.S. Institute for Peace, said the issue goes beyond war fighting. ""You need strong diplomacy and strong signals sent: We will not tolerate an organization which is linked to al Qaeda, that is killing American soldiers across the border in Afghanistan, that is posing threats to U.S. national security interests in the homeland. We will not allow you to continue to support this organization,"" Yusuf said. Other witnesses shared the view that a strategy shift is in order. Samina Ahmed, South Asia project director with the International Crisis Group, said the United States' certification requirements of the Pakistan partnership should ensure Pakistan takes firm action against violent extremist groups. ""We would advise and very strongly urge Congress to condition military assistance on demonstrable steps to combat violent extremists, that go beyond just al Qaeda, the foreign al Qaeda, but also homegrown jihadis,"" Ahmed said. Michael Krepon, co-founder and South Asia senior associate with the Henry L. Stimson Center, said the U.S. policies in Afghanistan are hurting Pakistan. ""If authorities in Afghanistan are unable to safeguard our military's hard-won gains, we are obligated to ask how much more blood and treasure ought to be devoted to this cause,"" Krepon said. He said the two countries are ""now very close to another divorce,"" but it would be ""a serious error in judgment ... to conclude that this relationship cannot be salvaged.""","Kerry says the United States should not rush to judgment .
