"By . Emma Glanfield . Air pollution levels in major UK cities have reached worryingly high levels and more should be done to combat ‘dangerous’ poor air quality, campaigners have warned. London, Manchester, Leicester, Liverpool and Birmingham all had at least five days last year when air quality was potentially harmful to healthy people. And Sheffield, Glasgow, the West Midlands and West Yorkshire all had at least one day when air pollution levels were rated 10 and reached the ‘very high’ category – the highest possible. The latest figures from the Government's Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs, reveal Greater London as the worst area in the country for air pollution . The findings come after it was revealed seven million people died globally from poor air exposure in 2012. The latest figures from the Government’s Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs, reveal Greater London as the worst area in the country for air pollution. There were at least eight days last year when air quality levels in the capital were marked in the ‘high’ category, which is deemed unhealthy and could cause eye and throat irritation to anyone exposed. There were six days in both Sheffield and the West Midlands when air quality levels were harmful and five days air pollution was deemed high in Greater Manchester, Leicester and Liverpool. Friends of the Earth air pollution campaigner Jenny Bates said ‘strong and urgent’ measures were needed to combat the growing air pollution problem. She said: ‘Breathing clean air should be a basic human right – it’s a scandal that poor air quality kills millions of people around the world each year. ‘Tens of thousands of people die prematurely in the UK annually because of dangerous air pollution, which regularly breaches legal limits. ‘Strong and urgent measures are needed to end this scandal, including action on road traffic, the main cause of most of the UK’s pollution.’ There were at least eight days last year when air quality levels in Greater London, pictured, were marked in the 'high' category, which is deemed unhealthy and could cause eye and throat irritation to anyone exposed . In comparison, there were no dangerously high days of air pollution recorded in Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh or Portsmouth last year. Elsewhere, Nottingham had four days last year where air pollution was deemed high, Swansea had two and Tyneside had one. Caroline Russell, Green Party Local Transport spokesperson, said: ‘Primary traffic emissions are known to play a key role in air pollution incidents. ‘London authorities must get serious about making London a safer place for people to cycle and walk. Only then can we create a more liveable and less vehicle-dominated city.’ Birmingham, pictured, and the West Midlands had at least one day last year when air pollution levels were rated 10 and reached the 'very high' category - the highest possible . There were six days in both Sheffield and the West Midlands when air quality levels were harmful and five days air pollution was deemed high in Manchester, pictured,  Leicester and Liverpool . Yesterday, the World Health Organisation revealed new data which confirms air pollution as the world’s largest single environmental health risk. Its report also said a stronger link had been established between both indoor and outdoor air pollution exposure and cardiovascular diseases, such as strokes and ischaemic heart disease, as well as between air pollution and cancer. Dr Flavia Bustreo, World Health Organisation assistant director for general family, said: ‘Cleaning up the air we breathe prevents non-communicable diseases as well as reduces disease risks among women and vulnerable groups, including children and the elderly.’ London, pictured, Manchester, Leicester, Liverpool and Birmingham all had at least five days last year when air quality was potentially harmful to healthy people .

"By . Bianca London . Luxury brands are reporting booming sales of erotic products from a new group of women known as 'Sindies'. Sindies are Single Income Now Divorced - high-earning females, often with children, back on the dating scene and looking for fun. Actress Liz Hurley, TV presenter Melanie Sykes and supermodel Heidi Klum are all members.

And they don't want to cut any corners in their pursuit of pleasure. Lingerie firms have reported a 45 per cent surge in sales among this group - newly single women aged between 35 and 50.

Bluebella, who commissioned the survey, said erotic lingerie like theirs is in demand from 'Sindies' Researchers believe that Melanie Sykes typifies the new Sindies . The study also found that, in Britain, where 65 per cent of divorces are initiated by women, Sindies . are celebrating their new-found freedom by throwing 'divorce parties' with other recent singles - typically spending around Â£90-a-head on the . brand's renowned 'erotic chic'. There are many current celebrity Sindies who typify this trend, according to the research. Liz . Hurley, 48, appears to be enjoying herself after splitting with her . cricketer boyfriend Shane Warne having previously divorced her husband. Melanie Sykes, 43, split with husband of eight years and father of her two sons and became a cougar icon after training . her body into pristine shape for her Ultimo campaigns - she recently . split with her toyboy husband and is back on the market.

"By . Hugo Gye . Preacher: Sheikh Yasser al-Habib is broadcasting inflammatory sermons from a small village . Residents of a wealthy village in Buckinghamshire fear their community could become involved in a global conflict between different Muslim sects after a hate preacher was given permission to broadcast his sermons from a former church. Sheikh Yasser al-Habib spent £2million buying a disused hall in Fulmer and turning it into a mosque which is also the base for his controversial satellite TV channel. Last week, Ofcom revealed it was powerless to stop the cleric's incendiary broadcasts, which are said to stir up conflict between al-Habib's Shia sect and rival Sunni Muslims. Now locals in the small village - favoured by celebrities such as Vernon Kay and Ozzy Osbourne - are concerned that Fulmer will become the unlikely setting for a vicious war of words between the two sects. The Kuwaiti preacher, who has previously been jailed in Kuwait for insulting the faith of Sunnis, bought the former evangelical church last year and converted into a mosque and broadcasting centre. His channel, Fardak TV, is registered by Ofcom - but most of its broadcasts cannot be controlled by the regulator because they are only shown outside the UK. Among the controversial sermons al-Habib has delivered over the airwaves was a celebration of the death of one of Sunni Islam's most revered figures. Two years ago, Ofcom investigated the preacher after it emerged that he had suggested one of the Prophet Muhammad's successors was gay. And in another slur directed at a figure beloved by Sunnis, he referred to Muhammad's wife Aisha as an 'enemy of God'. Sleepy: But Fulmer in Buckinghamshire is now the home of al-Habib's mosque and TV station . Pub: Local residents say they are concerned about the impact of al-Habib on the Fulmer community . Residents of Fulmer, where the average . home is worth nearly £1million, reacted with dismay to the news that . Fardak would be allowed to continue broadcasting hate speech. 'We have no objection to any religious group being there as long as they fit in with this community,' Kenneth Peters, 84, told The Sun. 'Does any community want to be the source of vitriolic and poisonous output? 'What half of us fear is a load of angry Sunnis from Slough coming here and having a rumble.' Another local added: 'I have Muslim friends who are so angry that lot can get away with spreading their bile.' Building: The preacher's mosque is located in an unassuming one-storey building behind a set of gates . Mosque: The sign advertising al-Habib's mosque, located on the site of a former evangelical church . The village of Fulmer, located in Buckinghamshire just outside the M25, apparently has its origins in Anglo-Saxon times - its name means 'lake of birds' in Old English. Long before the arrival of Yasser al-Habib's mosque last year, the first religious establishment in the village was St James's church, built during the reign of James I. Later in the 17th century, the family which owned the manor of Fulmer became so poor that they had to sell their home to their own servants because they could no longer afford to keep it. However, later residents were much less hard-up - the village's position between London and the countryside has made it a magnet for celebrities and the super-rich, and the average house there is now worth nearly £1million. Among the well-known figures who own properties in the area are TV presenters Vernon Kay and Tess Daly, heavy metal legend Ozzy Osbourne and Hollywood actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. As well as the 17th-century Black Horse pub, one of the village's principal attractions is the cricket club, whose clubhouse was opened by local boy Denis Compton. The village is situated in an idyllic cluster of Home Counties towns which are frequently used to film Midsomer Murders, while it is also close to Pinewood Studios where quintessentially British films such as the James Bond and Carry On series were produced. Last week, Labour MP Khalid Mahmood . described al-Habib's rhetoric as '10 times worse' than Salman Rushdie's . novel The Satanic Verses, which drew death threats from Islamic . extremists. He added: ‘If somebody was being anti-Semitic, we would take action. If somebody was being racist we would take action - even if it was an Asian person having a go at a black person. And it’s quite right to do that. ‘Because this is seen as intra-faith, nobody seems to be bothered. It is already causing problems in the Gulf and the Middle East. It will start to bubble up here as well.’ Stirring up hatred against Sunni Muslims could potentially be a breach of the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006, although it is not know whether police have ever investigated al-Habib. The rivalry between Sunnis - who include up to 90 per cent of the world's Muslims - and the minority Shias lies behind many of the world's most vicious conflicts, including the insurgency in Iraq. Fulmer, a village of fewer than 500 people, is in the commuter belt just outside the M25, and is inhabited by rich families who value the rural atmosphere and proximity to London.","Sheikh Yasser al-Habib bought £2million base in Fulmer last year .

"By . Mark Duell . On the run: Jordan Caldwell, of County Antrim, Northern Ireland, is now recovering and has grown two inches in three months . A 17-year-old boy has finally hit puberty after a four-year fight with anorexia stunted his growth. Jordan Caldwell, of County Antrim, Northern Ireland, developed an eating disorder aged 12, when he was dropped from his local football team - and believed he was ‘too fat’ to play. Desperate to become fitter, he started compulsively exercising and throwing away his lunch, shrinking to just 5st 3lbs. At his worst, he stopped eating and drinking completely. Jordan is now recovering and has grown 2in in three months. But the 5ft 5in teenager said his eating and weight problems began in May 2009 when he was dropped from his football team. Combined with the death of a family friend and the pressures of school exams, this triggered negative thoughts about his body. At home in the evenings, while his mother Siobhan, 44, father Leslie, 46, and sister Jessica, 12, sat watching television, Jordan would work out in his room, performing up to 500 crunches and push-ups. Concerned about his shrinking figure, his parents took him to his GP where he was told he was borderline underweight and needed to be monitored. Within a month he had dropped another 5lbs and was taken back to the doctors, who referred him with a suspected eating disorder to CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services) for help. Jordan was hospitalised in May 2010 weighing just 5st 8lbs and was not allowed to walk around. He had to use a wheelchair to stop him from exerting his body. His mother Mrs Caldwell, a teaching assistant, said: ‘We were helpless to make him eat - he wouldn’t listen to any of us. It was heart-breaking to witness him slowly starving himself.’ At first, Jordan refused to eat and would spit his food into rolls of tissue paper while pretending to sneeze or blow his nose. But, after six weeks of treatment and bed rest he eventually relented and managed small portions. He was finally discharged, but back at home he struggled to eat and continued to exercise. He said: ‘As soon as I got home I went back to my old habits. I was desperate to lose the weight again. I had weigh-ins twice a week and my weight would fluctuate. I was torn between getting better and not wanting to gain weight.’ Mrs Caldwell was forced to physically restrain him from exercising. She said: ‘From 7am to 11pm Jordan had to be watched. Family: Jordan is pictured (from left) with his mother Siobhan, 44, father Leslie, 46, and sister Jessica, 12. The boy developed an eating disorder aged 12, when he was dropped from his local football team . Stunted growth: Jordan is pictured (left) with his sister Jessica, before he was ill, on a beach holiday in Castlerock, County Londonderry; and (right) with her on day release during his treatment aged 13 . 'He was too sick to attend school so I . had to take time off work to monitor him. He wouldn’t sit down at all . during the day - the only time he would rest his frail body was at night . when he slept.’ Despite the . pain and the constant feeling of exhaustion, Jordan could not break . free from his obsession and he continued to restrict his body of food . and drink. His anorexia sparked an all-consuming obsessive–compulsive disorder, leading him to exercise more than four hours a day. Mrs . Caldwell would chase him around the garden, pleading with him to stop, . but he refused, terrified that his body would stop burning calories. At . his worst, Jordan stopped drinking for days, refusing to brush his . teeth in fear that just a drop of water would see him gain weight. His . lips were badly cracked from the dehydration. But . in July 2010, Jordan was admitted for treatment at Beechcroft . children’s psychiatric unit in Belfast. He weighed 5st 3lbs and was told . he would have to be tube fed if he didn’t begin to eat. Anorexia: Jordan with his mother Siobhan, and sister Jessica, on a home visit during treatment, aged 13 . He said: ‘I remember waking up to a . nurse putting Vaseline on my cracked lips. I became so angry and . aggressive that it might somehow make me put on weight. By this point I . just wanted to die.’ Puberty sees children mature sexually and their reproductive organs become functional. It starts for most boys at 12, while girls start developing from 11 on average, and it is caused by a release of sex hormones. Puberty causes rapid growth spurts, as well as the development of breasts in girls and an increase in boys' penis size. There also psychological changes that can see teenagers become self-conscious, aggressive and moody - and behavioural differences that lead teenagers to experiment with potentially dangerous activities such as smoking or sex. Early or delayed puberty in children - such as Jordan - can be caused by an underlying condition, such as a long-term illness. On his 13th birthday, Jordan collapsed and suffered a seizure and was . rushed to an accident and emergency department where he was given fluids . to raise his blood pressure and blood sugar levels. After 10 months of intensive treatment . and therapy, Jordan was allowed back home, but his body was so damaged . by the anorexia that his growth had been stunted - and doctors warned he may . never go through puberty. Jordan . gradually started to eat with his family at mealtimes, but it took him . more than two hours to finish a meal. He continued to receive treatment . and counselling, but life was still a struggle. Two years later in June 2013, Jordan bumped into family friend and personal trainer Ben Mudge, who suffers from cystic fibrosis. The . teenager was impressed by Mr Mudge’s muscly physique and - after . talking to him about health and fitness - Jordan decided he wanted to . have a man’s body, and found the motivation to get better. Jordan said: ‘When I saw Ben I was in awe. He was a really fit, healthy guy and he has taught me a healthy . approach to food and exercise.’ Getting better: Jordan (left), with his sister Jessica on day release during his treatment aged 13, and (right) with personal trainer Ben Mudge, last December, weighing 8st 6lbs . The pair became friends and Jordan’s body gradually started to recover and he was determined never to go back to hospital again. Help: Jordan trains with family friend Ben Mudge, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, every six weeks . He now consumes 3,500 calories, eating between six and eight nutritional meals a day. He said: ‘I became more positive and began to eat, increasing my calorie intake. Ben got me off my “safe foods” and I now eat peanut butter, as well as lots of protein. ‘To me, Ben is my superhero and helped saved me from anorexia. When I look at pictures of me when I was ill and me today there is such a difference. I don’t recognise the old me and never want to return to that. Jordan, who now weighs a healthy 8st 8lbs, trains with Mr Mudge every six weeks. He said: ‘I’m so thankful to be given a second chance and I want to inspire others and show them they can beat it.’ Mr Mudge, 24, said: ‘When I first met Jordan he was still in the grips of anorexia. He was very malnourished and still battling his demons. ‘He used to tell me he wanted to look like me, but I told him he needs to be himself.  Since he started working with me there has been such a change. I wanted to help him hit puberty and now he’s becoming a strong minded man. ‘Less than a year ago he weighed 6st 8lbs and now he is 8st 8lbs. I’m really proud of what he’s achieved - he’s a strong lad and I hope he continues on the road to recovery.’ Mrs Caldwell said: ‘I am so thankful to everyone who has helped Jordan with his recovery. 'He is still here today because of his family, medical and counselling care he received at Beechcroft and the continued care with the eating disorder team at CAMHS unit.’","Jordan Caldwell of County Antrim developed eating disorder aged 12 .

"By . Sam Webb . A drive-by attacker launched a knife assault on an innocent man in a horrific case of mistaken identity. Ayden Godfrey Dixon pulled up next to his victim on a moped and plunged the blade two inches into his neck, narrowly missing an artery. The 23-year-old, who had mistaken the man for someone he had fought with earlier in the night, was jailed for nine years at Leicester Crown Court. Scroll down for video . Brutal: Ayden Godfrey Dixon (left, in helmet) strikes out at his victim while sitting on his moped. The attacker thought the innocent man was someone he had been in a confrontation with earlier that evening . Ayden Godfrey Dixon (left, on moped, and right) thought the man was someone he had fought with earlier that day . CCTV footage caught the unprovoked attack as the 24-year-old man walked along a city centre street with friends at 4am on Sunday, February 23. The footage shows Dixon riding up to the men, stopping his bike and lunging at the victim before riding off. As the friends realise what has happened, the attacker stops, turns around and watches the group, before speeding away again. Leicester Crown Court heard that, when Dixon was arrested at his home in the city, he asked: 'Is the guy dead?' Judge Ebraham Mooncey, who saw the shocking footage, said: 'You rode up on your moped and lunged at him, while still sitting on the moped. 'You lunged towards his neck and collarbone and stabbed him, shouting and swearing. 'You paused for a moment and clearly appreciated what you had done. You then rode off, but someone recognised you.' Build up: The victim (in a blue long sleeve shirt on the left) is shown walking along at 4am. Dixon is on the moped in the centre . The attacker mounts the kerb to plunge the knife into the victim's neck. He had stashed the knife under his seat . After his sneak attack Dixon rides away from the group. At first the man thought he'd been punched but then felt the blood . Alan Murphy, prosecuting, said the target was knocked backwards and initially thought he had been punched before feeling the blood. He said: 'The wound was six centimetres deep and four centimetres wide, missing his artery by nine millimetres. The injury could have easily killed him.' After the sentencing, the victim, who did not attend court, said: 'I am pleased with the sentence and now hope I am able to move on from what happened.' In a statement read out in court, the man described having difficulty sleeping and said: 'I never thought it could happen to me, or anyone, and it was especially frightening this person stabbed me in the neck.' Chilling: Dixon stops and watches the group as they gradually realise what has just happened . He was so traumatised he could not face work, going to the gym or even leaving home alone to walk his dog or visit a shop. Dixon admitted wounding with intent, possessing a knife and driving the moped having consumed excess alcohol, as well as using it without a licence or insurance. A breath test showed he had 69 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, almost double the legal driving limit of 35 microgrammes. He had bought the moped the day before the attack and, despite drinking throughout Saturday, rode it into the city centre at night, storing the knife under the seat. Earlier in the night police had issued him with a dispersal notice, giving him five minutes to leave the city centre after he was involved in a skirmish in another pub. However, he got on to his moped and carried out the stabbing. The victim and his friends had been in the Lamplighter’s pub, but were not involved in any trouble. Dixon rode off after the attack, going the wrong way up a street, where he collided with a taxi. A bystander went to help, but stopped on seeing Dixon was holding a large knife. Dixon then made off on the damaged moped, which was later found by police in his back garden. At the time of the attack Dixon was on early release licence from a two-year sentence for burglary and theft, and had been free for four months. In 2008, he was banned from entering a nearby village for three years under an anti-social behaviour order. He was described at the time as the ringleader of a young street gang that had terrorised residents. He was later jailed for ignoring the ASBO. Sian Cutter, mitigating, said emotional upset had forced Dixon to turn to drink that day. She said: 'He saw the group in Church Gate and genuinely believed they were involved in the earlier violence and he lashed out. 'He didn’t intend to hit him in the neck, although he intended to stab him, not of such seriousness. 'He has poor thinking skills.' She said Dixon’s girlfriend was expecting their first child. Dixon was also banned from driving for three years.","Ayden Dixon thought the man was someone he fought earlier that night .

"By . Charlie Skillen . The first pictures of David Beckham's planned stadium in Miami can be revealed by MailOnline Sport. The 25,000-seater venue, set to be situated at the Port of Miami, will include a restaurant and a nightclub in an open concourse, as well as a world-class sporting arena. The as-yet-unnamed stadium would host 17 MLS games during the regular season, between March and November, as well as additional post-season games, soccer friendlies, and other entertainment. Most games would be on Saturday nights. A new Theatre of dreams? The first designs for  David Beckham's planned stadium for his MLS side have been revealed . Entertainment venue: The arena will feature a restaurant and a nightclub on the west-facing open concourse . Shining light: Beckham's team say the proposed design would create a new destination for Miami residents . Grounds for optimisn: The planned stadium - for the 23rd MLS franchise - is in a prime location on the Port of Miami . The port is one of four potential areas . for the new stadium, which Beckham's team say will create a new . destination for Miami residents. A central plaza on the site will include cafes, restaurants and shops. Beckham and his partners will pay for the . stadium without County or local taxpayer dollars, while the team will . also help to grow football's prominence in Miami-Dade County by creating . a new youth academy. The vision includes plans to regenerate the port's old bridge into the city's 'high line,' on which supporters of the new team would walk to the match, as well as space for future development around the Port. The other potential sites in the city are the FIU, the Miami International Center and Marlins Park - home of baseball outfit Miami Marlins. The 25,000 capacity would make the new ground the third-biggest crowd in the MLS, equalling the size of Thierry Henry's New York Red Bulls' Red Bull Arena. Teams like New England Revolution and Vancouver Whitecaps have bigger stadiums, but capacity for 'soccer' crowds is topped at below 25,000, with the teams sharing with American Football sides. It also means the team will pull in a bigger crowd than the city's basketball team Miami Heat, home to superstar LeBron James. Touchdown: Beckham arrives in Miami on Monday evening after doing his bit for Sport Relief . All smiles: David Beckham poses with fans wearing the proposed colours of the new club in Miami . In front of the mic: Beckham attended a press conference in Miami back in February with commissioner Don Garber (left) and Mayor Carlos Gimenez (right) However, as revealed by Charles Sale, Beckham’s stadium plans for the new franchise are being opposed by the cruise line companies who dock in one of the world’s busiest ports. Royal Caribbean Cruises have ‘deep reservations’ and have tabled a strong objection because they have their own plans to develop the 12 acres that Beckham and his investors have pinpointed. Asked why he chose Miami, the former . Manchester United and Real Madrid star said: 'Why not? All joking aside, . I wanted to create a team that we can start from scratch with. 'This is an exciting time for myself, family and friends. We're really looking forward to bringing this to Miami. 'There . was a team here 10 years ago but going forward I wanted to create a . team that's very personal. I want to make it my own team. Exciting times ahead: Beckham is keen to start from scratch and create a team to play in the MLS . 'Miami is a vibrant city with a lot of passion. I know it's ready for football and this will be successful. 'I'm committed to this league and I'm committed to this sport. 'There are a lot of people who want to know what we're doing and how we're doing it. I'm not in this to make money.' Meanwhile, it's understood the 38-year-old wants Barcelona star Xavi to join him in Miami for his new venture. The . midfield maestro, who played in Barcelona's 4-3 win over Real Madrid on . Sunday night, is tied to the Catalan giants until 2016 when he will be . 36 and, despite interest from elsewhere, he has made it clear he wants . to see out his career at the Nou Camp.

"By . Emma Innes . An 11-year-old boy who had a severely curved spine has gained six inches in height after an operation to insert magnets into his back. Thaine Marston was diagnosed with early onset scoliosis when doctors examined him after he fell off a trampoline in May 2011. The condition, which causes sufferers to have an S-shaped spine, can result in stunted growth and can cause respiratory problems. Thaine Marston (pictured with his mother, Paula) has grown 6ins after surgery to insert magnets into his spine . Thaine’s father Tony, 54, took his son to Nottingham University Hospital shortly after the fall when he found a lump on his son’s back. Consultant paediatric spinal surgeon Masood Shafafy told the schoolboy he would need invasive spinal correction surgery to straighten his spine. But while he was waiting for the operation, his mother Paula, 45, discovered MAGEC (Magnetic Expansion Control) treatment when she was researching treatments on the internet. MAGEC works by inserting an adjustable magnetic growing rod into the patient’s spine which can then be controlled by an external remote control. The rod is then lengthened by magnets outside the body which communicate with the magnets under his skin gradually straightening the spine. The family showed Mr Shafafy the MAGEC rods and Thaine underwent an operation to have them inserted into his spine at the Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham in July 2012. Thaine has early onset scoliosis meaning his spine was S-shaped (left). Surgeons inserted an adjustable magnetic growing rod into his back (right) and use it to gradually straighten his spine . If this procedure had not been available, Thaine would have faced much more invasive spinal surgery which would have involved his back being straightened using metal rods . The rod in Thaine's back contains magnets which can be controlled by external magnets. This allows doctors to adjust the rod without more surgery meaning they can extend his spine very gradually . Incredibly, the schoolboy was one of just 300 people in the world to have the rare surgery and one of the first patients in the UK. Just six days after the five-hour operation Thaine was back on his feet and recovering at his home in Draycott, Derbyshire. He has now told how he has grown a remarkable six inches from 4ft 9ins to 5ft 3ins in the last 18 months. Magnetic Expansion Control treatment is a way of straightening a curved spine. It works by inserting an adjustable magnetic growing rod into a patients back. This can then be controlled using an external control - this avoids the need for further surgery. The internal rod is lengthened using the magnetic remote control outside the body. This means the spine can be very gradually straightened. Usually, the child is required to return to hospital about every six weeks to have their spine straightened by a few more millimetres. This process continues until the child has reached their final height. He said: ‘I think it’s been much better for me and much better than a lot of people have had before. ‘It’s great and amazing that they got the funding. ‘I felt really, really nervous and really traumatised about it when I was diagnosed. ‘I would never think anything that serious would happen to a boy like me. I was really upset. ‘But after the operation everything is just like it used to be before. ‘I have now managed to have a much more normal life. I just have to be a bit more cautious about what I do.’ His father, who runs a convenience store and post office in Sheffield with his wife Paula, added: ‘It’s changed his life massively. ‘It means there isn’t intrusive surgery every six months and he does not have the same scars. ‘It makes a massive difference. He’s grown from 4ft 9ins to 5ft 3ins already since the operation. ‘It’s taking away all that risk of being in operating theatres and being under anaesthetic and having all those procedures. ‘He was up and out of bed after two days and home after six, much quicker than the other kids. ‘The scars are much shorter. It makes a big difference.’ Thaine (pictured with his mother, Paula, and father, Tony) was diagnosed with scoliosis after falling off a trampoline in May 2011. Following the accident his father noticed a lump on his back and took him to hospital . As Thaine continues to grow, surgeons can continue to straighten his spine. Image shows his surgeon using a magnet to adjust the rod in his back . After the operation, Thaine had to go back to hospital every six weeks for the magnets to be used to lengthen the rods inside his back. He will continue the process until he reaches his maximum height which he is expected to reach when he reaches his 20s. Surgeon Masood Shafafy said: ‘The other treatments interfere with the growth and the patients never achieve normal growth. ‘You either have to open them up and have repeated surgery or have disproportionate growth. ‘Without a doubt it’s a really life-changing thing - it’s pioneering. It is quite exciting. Thaine said: 'After the operation everything is just like it used to be before.' He is pictured after his surgery . Thaine was able to walk two days after his operation and went home six days after surgery. He is pictured just weeks after the operation . Thaine will continue to have treatment until his 20s. He is pictured before his treatment started . ‘There’s a rod which has a portion in the middle which has a rotating magnet. When you subject it to a strong magnet, that motorises things inside it and lengthens the whole rod. ‘You can bring the curve in line with the straight rods and correct the deformity. ‘As the child grows, every six weeks or two months you use the magnet to give them a few millimetres more, and you continue to do that until they reach their final height. ‘Not many surgeons in the country, only about four or five, can do this technique. ‘Thaine will have a normal life - and that’s absolutely down to this treatment.’","Thaine Marston has early onset scoliosis meaning his spine is S-shaped .

"By . James Salmon . The Chancellor launched the second big sell-off of Lloyds shares last night - raising hopes that British taxpayers could get their money back. The Treasury authorised the sale of a 7.5pc stake in the UK's largest bank, in a move expected to raise more than £4billion. The sale of 5.4billion shares will reduce taxpayers' stake in the giant lender from 32.7pc to around 25pc, and marks the biggest step towards re-privatisation taken so far. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne has agreed the sale of a further 7.5 per cent of the Government's shares in Lloyds . An announcement on the completion of the sale is expected today. Four investment banks appointed by the Treasury, including JPMogan, were instructed to approach giant institutional investors, including pension funds last night. Based on the bank's closing price of 79.11p, the latest sale is expected to raise about £4.2 billion. But the Treasury is only expected to make a small profit. Lloyds received a £20billion bail out from taxpayers during the height of the financial crisis in 2008. George Osborne has pledged to get taxpayers' money back, meaning he has to sell the shares at above the 73.6p 'break even' price paid by the previous government. Lloyds received a £20billion bail out from taxpayers during the height of the financial crisis in 2008 . The Treasury began its disposal of Lloyds shares last September with the sale of a 6pc stake in the bank for £3.2billion. But Mr Osborne's claims to have made a profit were rejected by spending watchdog the National Audit Office, which said the country made a £230million loss. For the second time, ordinary retail investors will not be able to take part in the Lloyds shares sale. It is thought that the Treasury and UKFI – the arms length body which manages taxpayers' stakes in bailed out bans – believes a retail offer is still too risky. Although the UK economy appears to be recovering, Treasury insiders said the 'global situation is less certain'. It is thought that the Treasury hopes to involve retail investors in the next sale and is targeting the Autumn. John O'Connell, director of the Taxpayers' Alliance said: . 'We're very keen that Lloyds and RBS are put back into private hands as soon as possible – as long as taxpayers get a good deal. Politicians have been tampering with banks for too long.' Hopes the Government could start re-privatising Royal Bank of Scotland have receded after the lender slumped to a £8.2billion loss last year.","Share sale expected to raise more than £4bn for the Treasury .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A mother taking pictures of her children playing in the garden unwittingly snapped an amazing cloud formation shaped exactly like the British Isles. Hollie Lindley, 29, had just returned to her home in Leeds, West Yorkshire from shopping on Sunday afternoon after a day of unpredictable weather. She started taking pictures of her two children playing in the garden when she noticed a cloud in the background shaped exactly like the UK set against a clear blue sky. Hollie Lindley, 29, had just returned to her home in Leeds, West Yorkshire when she snapped this picture of the cloud . And after her husband agreed that he too saw the similarity, she took another snap of the formation just to make sure. The sales customer co-ordinator said: 'I don't go out looking for  things to photograph, but I just happened to see it when I took a photo of my children. 'We had just come home from food shopping, the usual for a Sunday afternoon, and the children were in the garden playing. 'The weather has been on and off recently. We've had sun, rain and hail, a bit of everything really, so it was nice to get some blue sky. In 2009  teenager Jessica Wild while walking home from school captured a cloud shaped like Great Britain over Droitwich . 'The cloud looked exactly like Britain. I told my husband to have a look and he saw it too, so I took another picture of just the cloud.' The image is similar to another snapped in 2009 by teenageer Jessica Wild while walking home from school, showing a cloud shaped like Great Britain over Droitwich. The unpredictable weather of showers followed by blue skies and sunshine sometimes brings with it unusual cloud formations. A cloud shaped like a duck, left and another in the shape of an elephant, right have also been spotted above the UK recently . Earlier this month, an amazing duck-shaped culumus cloud was spotted in the skies above York by by York University student Ben Hopkins, 21, as he walked through the city's Rowntree Park. The History and Politics student said: 'I was pretty surprised when I looked up and saw it. 'In films you see clouds looking like things but you don't expect to see it in real life.' And last autumn, retired GP Margaret Worrall spotted a cloud shaped just like an elephant as she walked her dogs along the banks of the River Forth in Scotland. Cumulus clouds are a type of low-level cloud known for their puffy shapes and clearly-defined edges.","Hollie Lindley snaps an amazing picture of a cloud shaped like the UK .

She met her future husband in 1935 as she was taking her nephew for a walk in Old Buckenham. Mr Green, now 97, was out on his bicycle for a ride in the country when he spotted Daphne. The farm worker asked her out and was delighted when she said yes and regularly cycled the eight miles from his home in North Lopham to see her.

"By . Sean Poulter . ASDA has claimed a victory over its thriving budget rival Aldi by getting a TV ad, which claimed to offer savings of £45 a week, banned. Asda, Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s are under fierce pressure because millions have switched to the likes of Aldi and Lidl during the cost of living squeeze. The big four have lost billions in sales to their budget rivals, which have mounted aggressive campaigns to target middle income families. Aldi's 'Swap & Save' advert featured a mum who said she saved £45 a week by switching from her usual supermarket . Now, they are fighting back with price cuts of their own and attempts to undermine the discount claims of Aldi. Central to Aldi’s attack has been its ‘Swap & Save’ campaign, boasting that families can make significant cuts to the cost of the weekly groceries by switching away from big brands and big supermarkets. But the campaign has been seriously undermined following a complaint from Asda, which has today been upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The commercial, which ran in September and October last year, featured a real mum called Tracey who had shopped at her usual store for four weeks and then switched to Aldi, apparently saving £45 a week. She said: ‘I was very pleasantly surprised at the variety - the fresh food, the meat, the fruit and veg - it’s cheap and it’s good. Asda complained that the shopper in the Aldi advert bought different products and prices were based on 2013 and so could be out-of-date . ‘I think £45 a week is a lot of money given that we’ve got to spread it so thinly amongst so many things. So it’s definitely worth doing for us. Meaning that we can go on an extra holiday a year.’ The commercial was pre-vetted by a body called Clearcast, which is owned by the commercial broadcasters and advises companies on TV marketing rules. However, Asda made five complaints, all of which have been upheld by the advertising watchdog. It pointed out that the family used in the commercial did not buy the same items when shopping at the two supermarkets, which meant it was not a fair comparison. The survey did not include all the comparable items bought at the two stores and so could give Aldi an unfair advantage, while the figures behind the claimed saving of £45 were not clear. Asda pointed out that the price comparisons were made in the April to May period of 2013 and therefore may not have still been relevant when the commercial appeared. It also complained it would be wrong to imply that a shopper could always save £45 a week. Despite a watchdog finding the advert was 'misleading', Aldi insists the 'overall message remains true' The ASA said the lack of specific information in the commercial ‘created a misleading impression of the overall benefit to viewers of shopping at the advertiser’s stores rather than those of their competitors’. In its defence, Aldi insisted the commercial never claimed specific savings on a product by product basis, but rather pointed out how real families could make a saving on their total weekly shop. Asda promotes itself as the cheapest of the mainstream supermarkets. As a result it is particularly sensitive to the price cut claims of Aldi, which is quickly moving into the big league with sales growing at more than 30per cent a year. A recent Daily Mail survey on a small basket of 17 comparable items found Aldi was around £5 cheaper than Asda. Aldi said it was ‘wholly disappointed’ by the ASA’s decision. It said: ‘The Swap & Save adverts are based on the actual savings of shoppers and the overall advertising message remains true. ‘It is no surprise that other supermarkets are trying to find issue with our campaign as we continue to impress shoppers with both the price and quality of what we sell. ‘We are confident that Aldi offers some of the best value and lowest prices in the UK, and that we do this every day as opposed to during promotional periods that you may find in other supermarkets.’","Intense competition between big four supermarkets and budget rivals .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Guidelines: Schools have been told they should provide free morning-after pills and condoms to teenage girls to cut unwanted pregnancies . Schools have been told they should provide free morning-after pills and condoms to teenage girls, including those under the age of consent, to cut unwanted pregnancies. New guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) said that under-25s should be able to access emergency contraception more readily, including pills and the IUD (intrauterine device, or coil). Free condoms - including female condoms - . should also be 'readily accessible' for young men and women at places . such as 'schools, colleges and youth clubs'. The new guidance is aimed at cutting the high numbers of unwanted teenage pregnancies across England. Under the plans, Nice said suitably . qualified nurses, including school nurses, and pharmacists should be . given the ability to dispense free emergency contraceptive pills in . accordance with patient group directions (PGDs). PGDs allow health workers to supply a medicine directly to a patient without the need for a prescription. There are two types of emergency contraceptive pill. Levonelle has to be taken within 72 hours, or three days, of sex, and ellaOne has to be taken within 120 hours, or five days. Meanwhile, an IUD can be inserted up to five days after unprotected sex. Nice also renewed its 2010 call for young people to be given emergency contraception to keep at home in case they need it. And it said young women must be told of places they can obtain free, confidential pregnancy tests with same-day results. Young women should also be 'encouraged to consider and choose a suitable form of contraception for their future needs', the guidance said. Regarding under-16s, Nice said health . professionals providing emergency contraception must be aware that they . can give it to under-16s 'without parental knowledge or consent, in . accordance with best practice guidance'. It . added: 'Health professionals, including pharmacists, who are unwilling . (or unable) to provide emergency contraception should give young women . details of other local services where they can be seen urgently.' Morning-after: There are two types of emergency contraceptive pill including Levonelle which has to be taken within 72 hours, or three days, of sex . Nice said young people should be given access to contraception and advice at convenient locations so nobody is denied services because of where they live. 'It is really important that sexual health services offering information and advice can be found in places where young people have access to them,' said Professor Mike Kelly, director of the centre for public health at Nice. 'Evidence clearly shows that the availability of contraception reduces the rate of unwanted pregnancies. Local planners and providers of services must make sure that what they offer is right for their area.' He added: 'Young people often find contraceptive services and advice difficult to locate. This can be for a number of reasons. Accessible: Nice said young people should be given access to contraception and advice at convenient locations so nobody is denied services because of where they live . 'They may not know where services are, who provides them or when they are open. They can also be wrongly worried that information they give may not be treated confidentially. For that reason, this guidance focuses on ensuring they receive culturally sensitive, confidential, non-judgmental and empathic advice and support tailored to their individual needs.' The guidance also said condoms should always be provided in addition to other forms of contraception to cut the rate of sexually transmitted infections. 'Most sexually active young women use at least one method of contraception,' said Anne Weyman, chair of the independent . committee that developed the guidance and former chief executive of the . Family Planning Association. Figures: Office for National Statistics figures released last month showed the UK under-18 conception rate remains the lowest since 1969 at 27.9 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 17 . 'The good news is that the number of under-18s becoming pregnant is falling. But we really need to build on this recent progress because England still has one of the highest teen pregnancy rates in Europe. 'Most of the young women who become pregnant while still a teenager do not plan to do so. Nearly half of all pregnancies among 15 to 18-year-olds end with an abortion. 'The new guidance aims to reduce unwanted pregnancies by ensuring that young people have access to a full range of contraceptive methods, not just pills and condoms, but the longer-acting methods, such as contraceptive injections and implants. We also need to make sure that young people get good contraceptive advice so that they can choose and use the right method for them. 'As well as the unnecessary heartache for these young women, unwanted pregnancies also have a financial cost, with abortions for young women under 25 costing the NHS approximately Â£53 million each year. 'Investing in contraceptive services is a good use of money."" Office for National Statistics figures released in February showed that the UK under-18 conception rate remains the lowest since 1969 at 27.9 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 17. The number of pregnancies in those under 18 fell to 27,834 in 2012 compared with 31,051 in 2011 - a ten per cent drop. Some 5,432 under-16s fell pregnant in 2012, compared with 5,991 in 2011, a fall of 9.3 per cent. Among under-16s, some 3,251 pregnancies resulted in abortion - 59.8 per cent of the total. This is down on 60.2 per cent the previous year and 62.5 per cent the year before that. The figures also revealed that 253 girls under 14 fell pregnant in 2012, fewer than the previous year, with almost three-quarters having an abortion.","Guidance comes from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence .

"By . Jamie Redknapp . Saturday's battering of Arsenal has put Chelsea firmly in charge of the title race and, with Jose Mourinho in the driving seat, they have the perfect man to get them over the line. Mourinho has won league titles at every club he has managed, so he knows exactly what it takes. He insists on calling this Chelsea team underdogs, but they are nothing of the sort. After a poor result against Aston Villa, they reacted well with an easy victory over Galatasaray and by absolutely thumping one of their title rivals. Previous: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho knows what's required in order win league titles, as his record shows . Not convincing anyone: Mourinho may say his team are still underdogs in the title race, but they're definitely not . Emphatic: Chelsea ran riot in their 6-0 battering of fellow title contenders Arsenal at Stamford Bridge . Success: Jose Mourinho's previous title winning positions at this stage . That underlined just how strong they are and what a motivator Jose is. With seven games to go, Mourinho is in exactly the same position as when he won his seven league titles – on top. As . the table right shows, he had comfortable leads in his early years but . at Inter and at Real Madrid he demonstrated he can still win through . when the going gets tough. With the title race so tight this season, he will look at the Liverpool game at Anfield as one last obstacle to overcome. If Chelsea can get through that then they may well be celebrating come May. Comprehensive: Oscar scores his second of the game in the rout over Arsenal as Chelsea smash their rivals . To the point: Oscar takes the plaudits after adding to Arsenal's humiliation at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . Tim Sherwood caused a furore when he criticised his players after their 4-0 loss at Chelsea, but now they have responded. People said he risked losing the dressing room, but I’m sorry, footballers get paid a lot of money and they have to take the stick and get on with it. Tim showed heart and you could see that reflected in Tottenham’s performance yesterday. All smiles: Spurs manager Tim Sherwood will be pleased his players responded well to his criticism of them . Close up: Christian Eriksen scores Tottenham's first goal in their stirring comeback over Southampton . Triumph: The Spurs players celebrate with Gylfi Sigurdsson after he scored the winner over Southampton . They were unlucky to lose against Arsenal, showed some fight in Benfica last week and came from behind to beat Southampton. Christian . Eriksen was the difference and he looks the type of player Spurs fans . love. He linked well with Roberto Soldado, who did well, and they showed . good fighting spirit. Luis Suarez has to score six more goals to equal the Premier League record of 34 goals in a single season. Do not be surprised if he breaks it. Suarez has been phenomenal and has put himself up there with the likes of Thierry Henry. He’s been that good. Hands up: Liverpool's Luis Suarez scored a hat-trick in the Reds' entertaining 6-3 win at Cardiff on Saturday . Deadly: Suarez has now scored 28 Premier League goals and is only six short of the record in one season . He has eight games left to set the . record and that’s after he missed the first five of the season. It’s . frightening to think what he could have finished on. He . has equalled Robbie Fowler’s Liverpool record of 28 Premier League . goals in a season and in terms of ability he is right up there with the . Liverpool greats. You can’t compare him to Kenny Dalglish because of . Kenny’s longevity and what he achieved with the club, but Suarez can do . anything. Liverpool have . some tough fixtures to come but there are a few Suarez will have his eye . on, including a trip to Norwich – Suarez has 11 goals in five matches . against them. Partners: Suarez and Daniel Sturridge were on top form again as Liverpool racked up another win . The only minor . criticism you can make is that he doesn’t always perform to his . potential in the big games. In 26 matches against Chelsea, Arsenal and . the Manchester clubs, he has only scored seven goals. But . with Chelsea and Man City still to visit Anfield, Suarez will want to . set that right. If he does, he could well fire Liverpool to the title. Well done: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers congratulates Suarez on his goalscoring feats at Cardiff . Marksmen: The top Premier League scorers in one single season . As . the table shows, Luis Suarez is close to becoming only the seventh . player to score 30 or more Premier League goals in a season, and is six . short of Andy Cole and Alan Shearer’s record. Suarez missed the first five games of the season and he is the only striker on the list to average more than a goal per game. What a season. What . a result for Norwich. Chris Hughton has been under all sorts of . pressure this season, but he always seems to come up trumps. Norwich were the only side to win in the bottom eight, and that could be enough to keep them safe. Their last four games are against Liverpool, Man United, Chelsea and Arsenal, so points on the board are vital. Winner: Norwich boss Chris Hughton motivated his team to a hugely important win over Sunderland . Take that: Alex Tettey wheels away in delight after adding Norwich's second in their 2-0 win over Sunderland . Burnley’s 3-0 win over Charlton was their seventh in nine games and they now look certain to come up. The Championship is a tough league but manager Sean Dyche is a real personality. He is confident, talks well and the fans like him. No wonder they call him the ginger Mourinho!","Chelsea have the perfect manager in Jose Mourinho to clinch them the Premier League title .
The Tottenham players responded well to criticism from their manager Tim Sherwood by beating Southampton .
Don't be surprised if Liverpool's Luis Suarez scores six more times to equal the Premier League's record number of goals in one season - 34 .
Norwich were the only team in the bottom eight to win this weekend and it could be enough to see they escape relegation ."
"By . Lizzie Parry . It may look like a blast from the past, but this 1980s model Volvo is in pristine condition and good as new. The 27-year-old Volvo 340 is being sold with just 132 miles on the clock after spending nearly three decades in a garage. The car was bought brand new by an elderly gentleman in 1987. For sale: This 1987 Volvo 340 is up for sale in King's Lynn after its elderly owner passed away . Low mileage: The 27-year-old car has just 132 miles on the clock, compared with the 150,000 on Volvos of a similar age . Prang: The elderly owner bought the Volvo brand new in 1987, but weeks later he pranged the car, knocking a dent into the bodywork as well as knocking his confidence . But just a few weeks after purchasing the car, the man pranged his new wheels. After less than 100 miles he grazed the side wing when he hit a bollard at a garden centre. The incident not only knocked the car, it knocked his confidence prompting him to drive the Volvo into the garage and shut the door for good. For more than a quarter of a century the car has been left sheltered in the garage, away from the elements. The Volvo was only discovered in March after the gentleman's death. It was driven out of the garage in exactly the same condition as it was left when its engine was switched off in 1987. The two-door 'timewarp' has covered a total of 132 miles, compared with the average 150,000 of most Volvos of a similar age. The Swedish car is in an immaculate condition, and even boasts the original paper Volvo floor mats. It is being sold at part of a probate sale and will go under the hammer next month at Anglia Car Auctions' Classic sale. Hibernation: The elderly driver gave up his car keys, resigning the Volvo to the garage . Pristine: The car is in immaculate condition, having been stored in a garage away from the elements for nearly three decades . Discovery: The car was only found in March after its owner passed away. It is now being sold as part of his estate . A Volvo 340 of this age would normally only be worth around Â£250 - but this could sell for thousands with interest expected to be enormous. Rob George, from Anglia Car Auctions, said: 'It is very difficult to put a price on a car like this. 'I hate saying a car is in time warp condition, but I have never seen anything like this car before. 'I hope whoever buys the car will enjoys the car and should be an interesting sale. 'It is exactly how it was when it was bought apart from the minor damage. It even has the Volvo paper mats.' Despite its long hibernation the 340 starts and runs, though items like the brakes may well need attention. There is no sign of corrosion on the car and the interior retains the new car smell. Under the bonnet of the rear-wheel drive car is a 1.7-litre engine which develops a modest 80bhp. This gives the 2-door model a 0-60mph time of 13.5 seconds and a top speed of 105mph. The Volvo will be sold in King's Lynn on April 5. Sale: The car will be sold by Anglia Car Auctions in King's Lynn on April 5 . Prediction: Rob George from Anglia Car Auctions said he believes the car could sell for thousands, despite its age. He said: 'It is very difficult to put a price on a car like this.

"By . Rik Sharma . Samuel Eto'o has hit out at Pep Guardiola, saying he was a cowardly manager and never a 'great' player. The Chelsea striker played under Guardiola at Barcelona during the 2008-09 season but says the Spaniard barely spoke to him, using other players to communicate. Eto'o told BeIN Sports: 'I first of all . reminded Guardiola that he'd never been a great player. He was a good . player, that's true. I told him. As a coach, he had proven nothing. He . came in and didn't even know the story of the dressing room.' VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pep previewing Bayern's last-16 clash with Manchester United . Loggerheads: Striker Samuel Eto'o fell out with Pep Guardiola at Barcelona . The Cameroonian said that the manager told him he should move to Uzbekistan and also stripped him of the No 9 shirt, which he considered 'a total lack of respect'. Although Guardiola and Eto'o were at odds with each other, the forward still scored 30 times in his final season in Catalonia. During the season the Barca boss only spoke to his player on a handful of occasions. Eto'o said: 'Guardiola has never had the courage to say things in front . of me. He passed by the players. Key man: Eto'o was popular in the Barcelona dressing room . Deadly: Barcelona striker Eto'o scores against Manchester United in 2009 Champions League final . 'Xavi told me they wanted me to stay . but I had to talk to Pep. I say ""Never, if you do not respect me, I do . not respect you"". 'He . shook hands with me when I was at Inter and I played against Barca, but . this was just for the cameras and TV. Behind the scenes before the . match, he did not greet me.' Eto'o named three occasions when Guardiola spoke to him that season. One was when he wanted Eto'o to speak to Yaya Toure, who didn't want to talk to Guardiola either. Another was to tell him how to perform as a striker. Eto'o explained: 'Pep told me how to move like a striker. I told him, ""You're not normal!"" The true story is that Pep didn't respect the things in football.' The striker found far happier times under Jose Mourinho at Inter Milan the following season, and has linked up with the Portuguese boss again this term at Stamford Bridge.

Earlier this season Eto'o was not impressed with Mourinho when the Chelsea coach joked about his age. But Eto'o insists he has no problem with the Portuguese. He explained: 'He becomes someone else in the build-up to matches. Like any human being, he sometimes loses his reason. He proved it sometimes, like when he did it with me, but he takes all the pressure on himself.'","Samuel Eto'o says Pep Guardiola 'never had the courage to say things in front of me' while the pair were at Barcelona .

"By . Katy Winter . A young woman shed 10st after she was mistaken for her own mother on Facebook. Lauren Thomas, 28, of Llanelli, shrunk from size 26 to a size 14 after a friend thought a photo Miss Thomas had taken of herself was of her 66-year-old mother, Brenda. Miss Thomas said: 'I knew I'd put on weight but I had no idea I put 30 years on to my life too. The picture (right) which persuaded Lauren to lose weight after a friend mistook it for a picture of her mother Brenda (left) Lauren radically changed her diet, dropping from 20st (left) to about 12st 7lbs (right) 'I immediately changed my privacy settings so no-one could see the photo but I was utterly mortified.' Miss Thomas grew up surrounded by sweet and savoury treats because her family owned a bakery. She said: 'Pasties were my downfall. I was always eating them. 'When I got home from school I would always ask mum if I could help myself to a cake - she rarely said no, so I put on a lot of weight by the time I was a teenager. Lauren's weight continued to rise after her father died when she was 14 and she was bullied at school . 'I was bullied awfully. Some of my classmates called me Mandy Dingle because they thought I looked like Lisa Riley.' Miss Thomas's weight continued to rise after her father died when she was 14 years old. She said: 'I was very upset and I ate for comfort. One day I couldn't cope with the bullying anymore and lashed out at a boy who was teasing me. The headmaster called me into his office and I broke down when I told him about the bullying. Lauren often ate chocolate for breakfast, a Cornish pasty for lunch and an evening meal of sausage and mash . 'I spent a long time feeling angry but I learned to live with my size, even though deep down I was very unhappy.' Shortly after she left school her weight topped 19st. She . said: 'I was working in a care home when I tried to help an elderly . gentleman up and I pulled a muscle in my back very badly. 'I . couldn't work for six weeks while I recovered. A doctor took one look . at me and told me he wasn't surprised I'd injured myself because I was . so overweight. 'I felt he was quite rude and tried to brush it off but his words stayed with me for a long time afterwards.' In the wake of the appointment Miss . Thomas developed bulimia, a condition she would suffer with until she . discovered she was pregnant with her daughter Rhiannon, now three. She . said: 'I had been struggling, and was desperate for control. But . becoming pregnant made me comfortable in myself again. I made sure I ate . properly while I was pregnant and after Rhiannon was born I started to . put weight on again.' Although she originally dropped down to 10st, Lauren says she feels and looks better around 12st (pictured) In the midst of all these weight issues, in early 2012, weighing 20st, Miss . Thomas updated her profile picture on Facebook. It was then that her friend sent the message that was to change her life. The acquaintance posted: 'Oh my god, is that your mum? You look like twins'. 'She'd made an honest mistake but I was embarrassed beyond words. It hadn't occurred to me that I'd got to that point. The very next day Miss Thomas began the Cambridge Diet, which replaced the fatty and sugary foods she was used to with calorie-controlled milkshakes. Before beginning the programme, she often ate pieces of chocolate for breakfast, a Cornish pasty for lunch and an evening meal of sausage and mash with gravy or spaghetti bolognese with generous portions of cheese. She would snack on biscuits and crisps. Within just six months she weighed 14st, having lost more than 5st. By July 2013, she was down to 10st 7lbs  although today, she weighs around 12st 7lbs. She said: 'People said I looked ill when I was at my lowest weight. I'm 5ft 7in and I can't be too thin. 12st is a healthy weight for me and I'm trying to get down to that level now. 'I've finally found something which works, and for the first time I feel as if I've got some control.'","Lauren dropped from 20st at size 26 to 12st 7lbs and size 14 .

"By . Luke Garratt . A homeopathy company has recalled some of their products because they might contain traces of a real antibiotic. Terra Medica of Ferndale, Washington, described the products they're recalling as not containing antibiotics or antibiotic substances, but now they will now be conducting a voluntary recall of 56 lots of products. The recall was ordered when the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) found that the process the company used to make six of its products could have contaminated the products with penicillin. Terra Medica has performed a voluntary recall of many of its products, as they were found to contain penicillin . Homeopathic remedies are usually highly diluted and are not supposed to contain any active medicines. As a result, the FDA has chosen not to regulate homeopathic remedies as they are generally harmless. Unless they claim to cure a serious condition, such as cancer, the FDA doesn't usually ask the companies to prove their products are safe or effective. The danger with the recalled products is that if they have been contaminated with penicillin, users who are allergic to the antibiotic could have a reaction. Terra-Medica, Inc. is recalling 56 lots of Pleo-FORT, Pleo-QUENT, Pleo-NOT, Pleo-STOLO, Pleo-NOTA-QUENT, and Pleo-EX homeopathic drug products in liquid, tablet, capsule, ointment, and suppository forms. Terra Medica has had to recall 56 lots of products, including creams, suppositories and oral tablets because they could cause an allergic reaction . As a result, the FDA put out an immediate safety warning for those who might be allergic to penicillin. The organisation said: 'The FDA has determined that these products have the potential to contain penicillin or derivatives of penicillin, which may be produced during the fermentation process. 'In patients who are allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics, even at low levels, exposure to penicillin can result in a range of allergic reactions from mild rashes to severe and life-threatening anaphylactic reactions.' Previous scandals have been caused by homeopathic remedies and medicines containing various ingredients that may be harmful, or have adverse effects. For example, some products by the homeopathy manufacturer Zicam, a company that provides homeopathic remedies to coughs and colds, had unintended ingredients. In some cases products were found to contain active levels of zinc, and was linked to anosmia (a loss of smell) in some cases. Homeopathy is a medicine-like system which involves treating a person with highly diluted substances, given mainly in tablet form, with the aim of triggering the body’s natural system of healing. Based on their specific symptoms, a homeopath will match the most appropriate medicine to each patient. When manufactured correctly, homeopathic . remedies are generally harmless, mostly just solutions of water or . alcohol, possibly mixed into a sugar pill, or something similar. Homeopathy has been used for more than 200 years in various cultures across the world. It was discovered by a German doctor, Samuel Hahnemann, who was shocked with the harsh medical practises of the day (which included blood-letting, purging and the use of poisons such as arsenic). Dr Hahnemann looked for a way to reduce the damaging side-effects associated with medical treatment. He came up with a system of treating 'like with like', when a person is given a substance that may cause symptoms is given to somebody suffering those symptoms. E.g. Sleeplessness and agitation drinking too much coffee, so according to homeopathy, when made into a homeopathic medicine, coffee could be used to treat people with these symptoms.","Terra Medica has issued a voluntary recall of 56 lots of products .

"By . Tracey Cox . Affair rumours swirl but were Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin doomed from the start, given they are a classic case of 'opposites attract'? He's notoriously shy, lost his virginity at 22 (just a few years before hooking up with Gwyneth) and avoids the public eye. She has a fondness for first-night red carpets, a long list of lovers and Hollywood A-listers as best friends. Gwyneth Paltrow announced her separation from Chris Martin today . 'Seek a mate whose values and background echo your own' is standard relationship advice from people who know their stuff - like U.S. love guru John Gottman, who's been studying long-term couples for more than 25 years. Chris and Gwenyth flew in the face of that advice and got married anyway. Their 'conscious uncoupling' means they've proved the 'opposites attract but don't last' rule true, yet againâ€¦ or has it? Not only are Chris and Gwyneth managing a remarkably amicable separation, they clocked up a decade of marriage, which, quite frankly, is a lot more than most of us achieve. Could it be opposites have a lot more in common than we think? Research very firmly plants its feet on the side of similiarity. Tracey believes that parenting can keep a couple like Chris and Gwyneth together, the pair are seen here with their daughter Apple shortly after her birth in 2004 . Studies repeatedly tell us the key to long-term happiness is choosing someone who is a lot like you.If your partner agrees with you on most things, those destructive, 'they'd be perfect, if only' thoughts are reduced. Someone who validates your existing views and habits is far easier to live with than someone bent on trying to change you to theirs. It's logical: marry someone with a similar family background, income level, aspirations, personality traits, religion and age and your chances of romantic success are bound to be higher. The more a couple share a similar perspective to life, the less conflict there's going to be. Compatibility questionnaires used in pre-marriage counselling - asking questions like 'how important is being faithful?' and 'how should you raise children?' - are highly successful in predicting what chance a couple have of surviving and how happy they'll be with their relationships. Tracey says 'opposites' might not have the smoothest relationships, but the highs are likely to be higher . But there's one edge that opposites have over Tweedledum-Tweedledee couples: They have much better sex. Relationships without conflict are easy and comforting. But if you get on so well, you never have differing views about anything, your marriage has a brother-sister dynamic. If you're not quite sure of your partner and can't predict how they'll think or react, the excitement level is higher. Uneasiness might feel uncomfortable, but it keeps you on your toes. Love likes predictability. Lust doesn't. Love likes to keep loved ones close-by, kept away from any threats like rival partners. Lust thrives when our partners go out into the world without us because uncertainty and difference are what create a sexual spark. 'Opposites' might not have the smoothest relationships, but the highs are likely to be higher, which suits some personality types. The trick to getting the balance just right, is ensuring your differences and similarities are in the right areas. You wanting to spend Sundays curled up on the sofa with a book while he sets off on an eight-hour hike is a doable difference. One of you being deeply religious and the other an atheistâ€¦ not so much. A high compatibility score on personal and moral values is way more important than interests and hobbies for obvious reasons. Want the best of both worlds? A perfect match would be someone who agrees with you on important stuff like sexual morals, parenting and how to show affection but is passionate about things you haven't thought to explore. Perhaps this is the formula that kept Gwyneth and Chris going for 10 years. And perhaps that's not such a bad achievement.

"By . Chloe Hubbard . Despite the rhetoric about moving on too fast from a previous lover, a new study has found those who do move on quickly are emotionally better-off. The study by researchers at City University of New York and the University of Illinois discovered people who entered into a rebound relationship, defined as a relationship where the individual still has romantic attachments to their ex-partner, are happier and have healthier relationships. The findings also show people in new relationships were more confident and felt more attractive than those left trying to get over the heartbreak alone. Get over it: A study by psychologists proves wallowing in a blur . of Vodka and Chaka Khan like the fictional character Bridget Jones after . a break-up is not the answer. People should instead move-on into a . rebound relationship . It has been previously thought to be healthier to not enter into a new relationship while still harbouring feelings for an ex, but the study effectively proves rebound relationships may be more psychologically beneficial than typically thought. The study also proved that the quicker people move-on, not only are they personally happier, but they can also have happier relationships. Very little psychological research has been carried out into the benefits of moving on quickly before, but in the two studies carried out by both universities, the people who had moved-on quickly were ‘more confident in their desirability and had more resolution over their ex-partner’. The study assessed the people’s well-being, their feelings about their ex-partner, and whether they were seeing someone new. Despite the odds a rebound relationship really can be the best way to . mend a broken heart and go on to have a happier, healthier relationship, . much like the eventual storyline in The Rebound . Claudia Brumbaugh, Department of Psychology, Queens College, City University of New York, said: ‘A “rebound relationship” is commonly understood as a relationship that is initiated shortly after a romantic breakup—before the feelings about the former relationship have been resolved. ‘Little research has examined the consequences of quickly beginning new romantic relationships after another has ended. In two studies we examined people who experienced a breakup and assessed their well-being, their feelings about their ex-partner, and whether they were seeing someone new. ‘Analyses indicated that people in new relationships were more confident in their desirability and had more resolution over their ex-partner. ‘Among those in new relationships, the speed with which they began their relationship was associated with greater psychological and relational health. Overall, these findings suggest that rebound relationships may be more beneficial than typically believed.’","University of Illinois and City University of New York study on rebounds .

"By . Emma Innes . A young brain tumour patient who was told she would die if she didn’t have an emergency procedure has made a remarkable recovery. Lois McLennan, 23, had continuous headaches and severe shooting pains in her arms and legs for six months before she collapsed while staying with friends in London. The studio administrator, from Stockport, Manchester, underwent a series of tests and doctors found she had fluid on the brain. Lois McLennan was diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumour after she collapsed while staying with friends . As a result, she was transferred to The National Hospital For Neurology and Neurosurgery, in central London. Scans revealed she had a cancerous brain tumour and she had to be given a life-saving shunt to drain fluid from her brain and relieve the pressure inside her skull. Ms McLennan said: ‘I was absolutely petrified because I knew I’d been unwell for some time but I had no idea it was so serious. ‘Doctors told me if I didn’t have the shunt I could have died. I’ve never been so worried in my life. ‘I was having really bad headaches for quite a long time and I ended up going to the doctors almost every week and they gave me medication but it didn’t work. ‘I started to lose the feeling in my arms and legs - it was like a really severe kind of pins and needles, so I knew it was something more serious.’ Ms McLennan (pictured during her treatment) was told she would die unless doctors were able to fit a shunt to drain fluid from inside her skull and to reduce the pressure on her brain . Ms McLennan had to have surgery and radiotherapy in a bid to treat the tumour which spread to her spine . Ms McLennan says she took a turn for the worse while visiting friends in London. She said: ‘I went to London to visit some friends last summer on a scorching hot day and I remember my leg going incredibly numb. A shunt is a thin plastic tube that is inserted during surgery. It is used to treat people with fluid on the brain. Without it, the fluid can cause pressure inside the skull to build up and, in extreme cases, this can be fatal. The shunt transports excess fluid into another part of the body - usually the abdomen. From here, it is absorbed into the bloodstream. The shunt surgery usually takes place under general anaesthetic and takes one to two hours. Source: NHS Choices . ‘All of a sudden I fell over in front of my mates. I had no control of my leg and I just crashed to the ground. ‘I went to A&E and they told me I was going to need a CT scan and then afterwards they told me I was going to be transferred to the neurology department because they spotted something on my brain scan. ‘An MRI scan showed that I had a fluid block in my brain and that I’d need a shunt, where fluid is passed from one part of the body to another, to drain the fluid. ‘It’s was a truly frightening experience for myself and my family but I felt much better when I got transferred closer to home.’ Ms McLennan was rocked by the news that she may lose the ability to walk due to her cancer and doctors even told her she could become infertile. She said: ‘I’d been in the hospital in London for a few weeks then they were able to transfer me to The Christie so I could be closer to home. ‘They thought my tumour was benign at first, but then after more tests they found out the cancer had spread to my spine. ‘I was actually told that I could lose the ability to walk and that there was a chance I’d have to be fed through a tube in the future. Ms McLennan (pictured with her mother, Zita) said: 'I was absolutely petrified because I knew I'd been unwell for some time but I had no idea it was so serious' Ms McLennan was told she could lose the ability to walk or become infertile as a result of her illness and treatment. She is pictured with her father, Ian . ‘I was also told that treatment could make me infertile which was very upsetting.’ Ms McLennan started six weeks of radiotherapy at The Christie Hospital in Manchester in September 2013 and required hour-long sessions every day. After finishing the therapy in November, she was told there was still a 50 per cent chance of the cancer returning, and if it did it was likely to prove fatal. She continues to have check-ups every three months at The Christie Hospital and her family have rallied to raise funds to thanks staff for all they have done for her. Ms McLennan’s mother, Zita, 54, took part in a sponsored slim to raise money for the hospital. Ms McLennan is doing well but has to have check-ups every three months. She's pictured having radiotherapy . Ms McLennon has been told there is a 50 per cent chance of her tumour returning. Image shows the back of her head after surgery . She raised £4,000 by shedding 18lbs in just seven weeks. She commented: ‘We all wanted to do something to show the staff how much we appreciated what they did for her. They were incredible. ‘It was a constant stream of bad news for six months and there just seemed to be one blow after another. ‘Watching my daughter suffer in that was heart-breaking, but staff at the hospital were fantastic. ‘The support I’ve received has been overwhelming and seeing the money total shoot up has been a real incentive.’","Lois McLennan had severe headaches and pains in her limbs for six months .

"By . Mark Prigg . Dramatic new designs for skyscrapers ranging from a huge 'eco-tower; in the Amazon rainforest to a design with a movable roof based on a Koreen home have been revealed as part of a design contest. The eVolo Magazine 2014 Skyscraper Competition shows off a range of unique designs, including a desert tower made from sand. It also includes a 'city in the sky' for Detroit, and a Sky Village for Los Angeles. The Rainforest Guardian Skyscraper,a  Chinese design to help montor forests for fires and conduct experiments high above the treeline. eVolo Magazine received 525 projects from 43 countries in all continents. The Jury, formed by leaders of the architecture and design fields selected 3 winners and 20 honorable mentions. One of the winners, The Rainforest Guardian Skyscraper, consists of a water tower, a forest fire station, a weather station, and scientific research and education laboratories. It stands still at the Amazon’s frontier, preventing fires effectively by capturing rainwater in the rainy season and irrigating the land in the dry season. The lotus-shaped water tower is capable of capturing rainwater directly. The collected water is filtered and stored in spare reservoirs. Using capillarity combined with active energy, the aerial roots with a distinct sponge-structure can absorb and store the excess water without disturbing the Amazon’s ecosystem. In the case of fire, firefighters fly to the scene and extinguish the fire with the collected water. In addition, the Guardian Skyscraper provides special scientific research laboratories for scientists to monitor the climate change and the ecosystem stability. The laboratories also act as exhibition spaces for tourists to create environmental awareness. How it works: The Rainforest Guardian Skyscraper, consists of a water tower, a forest fire station, a weather station, and scientific research and education laboratories . First place was awarded to Yong Ju Lee from the United States for his project 'Vernacular Versatility'. The proposal reinterprets traditional Korean architecture in a contemporary mixed-use high-rise. Hanok is the named used to describe a traditional Korean house. The curved edge of the roof can be adjusted to control the amount of sunlight entering the house while the core structural element is a wooden connection named Gagu. The Gagu is located below the main roof system where the column meets the beam and girder and it is fastened without the need of any additional parts such as nails – this connection is one of the main aesthetic characteristics of traditional Korean architecture. An electromagnetic vertical accelerator, utilizing the technological principles developed at CERN¿s LHC and maglev train propulsion, the Launchspire provides a method for commercial aircraft to be accelerated to cruising speed using renewable electrical energy sources from ground based infrastructure . Sand Babel is a group of ecological structures designed as scientific research facilities and tourist attractions for the desert. The structures are divided into two parts. The first part, above ground, consists of several independent structures for a desert community while the second part is partially underground and partially above ground connecting several buildings and creating a multi-functional tube network system. The main portion of each building is constructed with sand, sintered through a solar-powered 3D printer. The second place was awarded to Mark Talbot and Daniel Markiewicz from the United States for his project “Car and Shell: or Marinetti’s Monster” which proposes a city in the sky for Detroit, MI. The recipients of the third place are YuHao Liu and Rui Wu from Canada for their project 'Propagate Skyscraper' that investigates the structural use of carbon dioxide in skyscrapers. Some of the honorable mentions include a skyscraper that filters the air of polluted cities, a sky village for Los Angeles, a 3D printed tower in the desert, and a vertical transportation hub among other innovative projects. First Placein the contest went to Vernacular Versatility by Yong Ju Lee (United States). Hanok is the named used to describe a traditional Korean house. A Hanok is defined by its exposed wooden structural system and tiled roof.

"By . Luke Garratt . A new Google tool has been installed on the search engine site which allows users to compare different foods - right down to their nutritional information. The tool is designed so that if a user type in two types of food, with the word 'vs' in between, or the two foods with the word 'compare' preceding it, they will see a chart revealing the foods make up, comparing them side by side. The tool even measures the different foods based on how they are prepared and what is in them, as well as portion size. The tool appears automatically when you type in two foods with the word 'vs' in between them, and displays the most relevant nutritional information available in a comparison . For example, typing in 'sweet potato mash vs mashed potato' will show you that sweet potatoes have 4.2 grams of sugar per 100 grams and mashed potatoes have just 0.5 grams for the same portion. But scroll down and you can see that sweet potato mash beats mashed potatoes in the amount of potassium, calcium content and vitamin A they have. A drop down menu allows you to change portion or preparation methods or additions to see how this changes the fat or sugar content. If you changed the method of making mashed potatoes to 'potato, mashed with milk and margarine' the fat content will rise to 4.7 grams, whereas if you change it to 'mashed with milk and butter' it rises again to 5 grams of fat. The tool can even be used for bizarre combinations of different food groups, such as 'bacon vs grape' The tool can be used to compare anything, from 'pizza vs pie' to 'apple vs grape'. Even concordant foods from different food groups can be compared, such as 'bacon vs grape', for those concocting strange food combinations, or for those who are just curious. The tool is made with nutritional information taken from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and was installed after the success of Google's original nutrition search tool that was released in May 2013, according to Google spokeswoman Krisztina Radosavljevic-Szilagyi. In an interview with NPR Ms Radosavljevic-Szilagyi said: 'We noticed that people were doing a lot of food and nutrition searches â€” multi-step searches on one food and another food. 'These things are often compared to one another, so we thought, why don't we make it easy?' Some foods have far more information than others, and many comparisons reveal how much artificial ingredients some foods have . The nutritional information was gathered by Google from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the tool was quietly installed on at the end of last year after the success of their original nutritional information tool . Ms Radosavljevic-Szilagyi added that Google's algorithm is always calculating 'what might be useful to you when you ask a question'. She said: 'There are plenty more complicated food, recipe and nutrition questions . to help people answer. We want to give as many answers to as many . complicated questions as possible.' The tool was developed and quietly installed at the end of 2013, and was shortly followed by another tool that lets users access restaurant menus much quicker. For the second tool they have already accessed menus of 75 per cent of the restaurants in the U.S. The tool, which is activated from typing directly into the Google search bar, also works in conjunction with Wikipedia and IMDB facts to compare other things, like movies, except the data will be used to compare directors, budget and earnings.","Tool activated by typing foods into Google search bar with the word 'vs' between them .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . We live in an age when people are increasingly aware of the importance of keeping their bank details safe. And soon bank notes and credit cards could have anti-counterfeiting ‘fingerprints’ smaller than the width of a hair to make them almost impossible to replicate. The fingerprints are made from tiny nanowires that scientists claim will stump even the most determined of forgers. Soon bank notes and credit cards could have anti-counterfeiting 'fingerprints' to make them almost impossible to replicate. The fingerprints are made from tiny nanowires that scientists claim will stump even the most determined of forgers. Here an expert examines a 50 Euro note that he suspects is a fake . The new £1 coin, set to be introduced in 2017, will be the most resilient to counterfeiting in the world, according to the Royal Mint. The technology that has taken four years and £2million to develop at the mint’s base in Llantrisant, south Wales will see secure technology used in banknotes embedded into the coins, the BBC reported. It is expected that none of the new £1 will be copied by forgers. Andrew Mills, the Royal Mint's director of circulating coin, said: 'iSIS (Integrated Secure Identification Systems) is technology that has been available in bank notes for 20 years but now we can actually use it in a coin. ‘Up until now it's been more difficult to use in coins because they're metal, but now we can.’ Fake £1 coins cost £2million a year and there are thought to be 45million in circulation. The unique patterns contain between 20 and 30 of silver strips that are scattered onto a thin, plastic film. Each has an average length of 10 to 50 microns - a millionth of a metre - while the average human hair is 18-80 microns wide. The researchers hope their device, described in the journal Nanotechnology, will be used to tag a variety of goods, from electronics and drugs to credit cards and bank notes. They say that criminals will be thwarted by the natural randomness of the fingerprints combined with the difficulty of handling such small materials. ‘It is nearly impossible to replicate the fingerprints due to the difficulty in trying to manipulate the tiny nanowires into a desired pattern,' Professor Hyotcherl Ihee, of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, said. The researchers hope their device, described in the journal Nanotechnology, will be used to tag a variety of goods, from electronics and drugs to credit cards and bank notes. They say that criminals will be thwarted by the natural randomness of the fingerprints combined with the difficulty of handling such small materials. Here, a chief inspector shows the equipment currently used by criminals to forge passports and credit cards . ‘The cost of generating such an identical counterfeit pattern would generally be much higher than the value of the typical product being protected,’ he said. The wires are grown in a solution and coated with silica and fluorescent dyes before being inserted into a plastic film made from polyethylene terephthalate, which is also used to make clear drink bottles. Each would cost about 50 pence each to manufacture. The fluorescent dyes allow the patterns, which are invisible to the naked eye, to be authenticated under an optical microscope and could add another layer of complexity if a number of different colours are used. The researchers believe the fingerprints could also be tagged with a unique ID or barcode, which could facilitate a quick search in a database and ease the process of authentication or counterfeit identification. The experts claim the cost of generating a minute counterfeit pattern of wires would be higher than value of most products being protected by them. The wires are grown in a solution and coated with silica and fluorescent dyes before being inserted into a plastic film made from polyethylene terephthalate, which is also used to make clear drink bottles (pictured) Professor Ihee said: ‘Once a pattern is tagged and stored on a database using a unique ID, a certain substrate, whether this is a bank note or a credit card, could be authenticated almost immediately by observing the fluorescence images and comparing it with stored images. ‘These authentication processes can be automated by employing an algorithm that recognises the positions and colours of the silver nanowires and digitizes that information in a database. Such information could significantly reduce the size of the stored data and reduce the time required for the authentication process.’ According to the World Customs Organisation, around six per cent of global traded goods are counterfeit which the researchers believe could be reduced by using their technique to authenticate goods. ‘Compared to other anti-counterfeit methods, the fingerprints are cheap and simple to produce, they are extremely difficult to replicate and can be authenticated very straightforwardly,’ Professor Ihee added.","Researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology created anti-counterfeiting prints as small as 10microns wide .

"By . Ben Spencer . More than 66 million years ago, a fearsome beast roamed the planet that was so ferocious it has been dubbed the 'chicken from hell'. Standing 10ft tall, the creature got its name because of a chicken-like crest on its head, feathered wings, long talons, a dangerous beak and a powerful tail. Its official name is Anzu wyliei and palaeontologists from the University of Utah discovered three partial skeletons of the animal in ancient rocks in North and South Dakota. Standing 10ft tall, the Anzu wyliei creature, illustration pictured, got its name because of a chicken-like crest on its head, feathered wings, long talons, a dangerous beak and a powerful tail. Palaeontologists from the University of Utah discovered three partial skeletons of the animal in ancient rocks in North and South Dakota . Name: Anzu wyliei - after a bird-like demon in ancient mythology. Height: 10ft (3m) Weight: 45 stone (286kg) Age: The dinosaur lived around 66 million years ago. Features: The dinosaur had a crest on its head, feathered wings, long talons, a dangerous beak and a powerful tail. Diet: Vegetation, small animals and eggs. Character: Fighter. Found: In ancient rocks in North and South Dakota. Piecing the three fossils together, they found the separate parts formed an almost complete skeleton of a dinosaur. Emma Schachner, a biology postdoctoral fellow at the University of Utah, said: ‘It was a giant raptor, but with a chicken-like head and presumably feathers. ‘The animal stood about 10ft tall, so it would be scary as well as absurd to encounter.’ Matt Lamanna, of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, added: ‘We jokingly call this thing the 'chicken from hell,' and I think that’s pretty appropriate. ‘So we named it after Anzu, a bird-like demon in ancient mythology.’ The findings, published in the journal Plos One, describe a 45-stone beast which roamed the Dakota Hills 66 million years ago, at the same time as the most fearsome predator, Tyrannosaurus Rex. Resembling a gigantic flightless bird, Anzu wyliei had a slender neck and hind legs, similar to an ostrich. Piecing the three collections of fossils together, pictured, researchers found the separate parts formed an almost complete skeleton of a dinosaur. The fossils have preserved only bones, but close relatives of this dinosaur have been found with fossilised feathers, strongly, suggesting the new creature was feathered too . The fossils have preserved only bones, but close relatives of this dinosaur have been found with fossilised feathers, strongly suggesting the new creature was feathered too. The dinosaur was an omnivore, eating vegetation, small animals and perhaps eggs, but the scientists think it may have been built to defend itself from larger predators. Two of the three skeletons have signs of injuries, suggesting the species was a fighter. One has a broken and healed rib, and the other has evidence of trauma to a toe. Dr Schachner continued: ‘These animals were clearly able to survive quite a bit of trauma, as two of the specimens show signs of semi-healed damage. ‘Whether these injuries were the result of combat between two individuals or an attack by a larger predator remains a mystery.’","Anzu wyliei was a fighter and had a chicken-like crest on its head .

"By . Louise Eccles . Oliver Hiscutt, 2, died after being misdiagnosed . A toddler died from a bacterial throat infection after his GP sent him home with Calpol. Two-year-old Oliver Hiscutt had complained of a sore throat and was given the paracetamol- based painkiller on the advice of his doctor and NHS Direct. But they had failed to spot he was suffering from Streptococcus, a bacterial infection that is experiencing a surge in Britain. It escalated into a fatal abscess that ruptured a major blood vessel in Oliver’s throat. He was eventually admitted to hospital but died from a ‘catastrophic bleed’ two days later. At an inquest, assistant coroner Sara Lewis said she would write to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt calling for better guidelines on how to spot Invasive Group A Streptococcus, which was ‘very difficult to diagnose’. The court heard the infection is on the rise and could prove fatal when left untreated. Paediatric consultant Dr Catherine Lenton told the hearing: ‘There used to be an epidemic where thousands of children would die, but now we are going through a surge and there are no national guidelines on Invasive Group A and its high mortality rate. It is on the increase and higher than we would usually expect.’ Oliver’s parents, chartered accountant David, 34, and Julie Hiscutt, 35, wept as they listened to the evidence at Heywood Coroner’s Court. The court heard their son was a ‘healthy and happy’ boy who had only been to the doctor for minor illnesses. But on September 21, 2012, Oliver awoke crying. Mrs Hiscutt, from Wilmslow, Cheshire, told the inquest that he pointed to his mouth to show where it hurt. Oliver and his father, chartered accountant David Hiscutt, 34, before Oliver died from a bleed in his throat . When Oliver Hiscutt woke up crying his father David, left, and mother Julie, right, rang NHS Direct for advice . After days of worry, Oliver's parents took him to a GP, fearing he had meningitis, but were told to give him Calpol . ‘He didn’t seem himself, but no worse than a cold and at that stage he was still eating, but not quite as well as normal,’ she added. Oliver developed a rash on his stomach and his parents called NHS Direct, which suggested giving him Calpol and told them it was most likely a virus. Mrs Hiscutt said: ‘Over the course of the week he was still not himself. He was very quiet. He was not our usual boy.’ On September 24, Mrs Hiscutt took Oliver to their GP fearing he had meningitis, but was again told to give him Calpol. After showing no significant improvement and developing a red tongue, Oliver was admitted to hospital on September 30. He was initially treated for viral tonsillitis, but doctors later realised it was a bacterial ‘strep’ infection. He was put on intravenous antibiotics and showed signs of recovery and was sent home from hospital. But on October 5, his condition worsened and he was rushed to Wythenshawe Hospital’s A&E department. He died before doctors could conduct an ultrasound on his throat, which would have revealed the retropharyngeal abscess, which ruptured a blood vessel. The inquest revealed that GPs, paediatricians and ear, nose and throat specialists failed to recognise the infection because it was easily mistaken for many other illnesses, including viral tonsillitis. After a few days of quiet crying from Oliver, he was eventually admitted to hospital and treated for viral tonsillitis, only for doctors to realise it was a bacterial infection and put him on intravenous antibiotics . In a statement read to the court, specialist Dr Andrew Camilleri said the catastrophic bleed Oliver suffered as a result of the abscess is incredibly rare. He pointed to one case in South Africa but said there had been none in this country. Recording a verdict of death by natural causes, coroner Mrs Lewis called for ‘mandatory paediatric training for GPs’. Her report and recommendations will be sent to the Department for Health, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and the Royal College of General Practitioners. Following treatment at the hospital reducing Oliver's symptoms, he was sent home to recover a few days later . Following his second admission to hospital after his condition worsened, doctors were making plans to give him an ultrasound to detect the problems in his throat, when he died of a bleed due to the abscess . An inquest labelled Oliver's death a passing by natural causes, but the coroner pledged to contact the government to try and improve guidelines around strep infections. In addition, his parents have been raising money for the children's ward at Whythenshawe hospital .","Oliver Hiscutt died from bacterial abscess bleed caused by strep infection .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . From creepy clowns to demonic serial killers, ‘possessed’ dolls have been the subject of many a horror film. Now an animatronic life-sized doll with a scary face and even more frightening dance moves might give you nightmares. The unnamed robotic dancer features in a New York-based art installation and gyrates to music while staring at onlookers - perhaps challenging the popular notion that gyrating and grinding are sexy dance moves. Scroll down for video . The unnamed robotic dancer (pictured) features in a New York-based art installation and gyrates to music while staring at onlookers using facial recognition technology . Name: Unknown. Location: David Zwirner Art Gallery, New York. Dance Moves: Gyrating, grinding and swiveling plus expressive hand gestures demonstrating cutting-edge animatronics. Eye contact: The doll uses facial recognition technology so its eyes can follow a viewer around the gallery. Voice: It lip-syncs to songs by Robin Thicke and Lady Gaga and also says phrases using the voice of its creator - 33-year-old artist Jordan Wolfson. Support: A metal pole fixed to a mirror lets the doll dance fluidly. The doll was created by artist Jordan Wolfson with help from Spectral Motion effects studio in Los Angeles and is on display at the David Zwirner Art Gallery until April 19. The humanoid’s movements are convincingly realistic and fluid and it is able to stay upright thanks to a metal pole connecting it to a mirror. It uses facial recognition technology to . seek out viewers in the gallery and stare at them with its terrifying . green, masked face. It even follows people with its gaze if they move . across the room. It wears a skimpy white dress, boots and haunting witch-like mask with its geared shoulders plainly on view, while other body parts are convincingly realistic from a short distance away. The supporting pole allows the exotic dancer to gyrate and swivel while staring at the reflections of onlookers, iO9 reported. The doll uses facial recognition technology to seek out viewers in the gallery and stare at them with its terrifying green, masked face. It even follows people with its gaze if they move across the room . It is assumed that the doll follows people with its terrible eyes to make them feel uncomfortable if they are trying to view it as a sexual object. The animatronic doll dances along to distorted versions of songs including Robin Thicke’s hit, Blurred Lines, which features a number of scantily clad girls dancing in white outfits in the controversial video. However, the robot is far less glamorous as ‘she’ appears to be slightly grubby and has a mask capable of unnerving most adults.

Now that's pole dancing: The animatronic doll dances along to . distorted versions of songs including Robin Thicke’s hit, Blurred Lines and is held upright by a metal pole secured to its abdomen that just out from the mirror. It is pictured performing different 'sexy' moves left and right its in grubby white dress . It also lip-syncs to songs by Lady Gaga and Paul Simon and challenges viewers to close their eyes and stop watching it, according to a report by Gallerist. The doll’s deep voice is that of Wolfson’s and juxtaposes with the doll’s femininity and exotic dancer attire. Its realistic hand gestures – a feature of cutting edge animatronics - make the experience of watching it move even more unnerving. The 33-year-old artist told Blouinartinfo via iO9 that the work is not a comment on women but is simply designed to engage with art gallery visitors one-on-one.","The unnamed robotic dancer features in a New York-based exhibition by 33-year-old artist Jordan Wolfson .

"By . Mark Prigg . It is a bizarre mix of kitesurfing and sailing - and could be the next big extreme sport. Two Dutch sailors invented the sport after deciding to try and fly their boat using a kite. Now the Kitetender has gone on sale, and the pair believe it could be the next big thing in watersports. The new sport involves using a kite to 'tow' a boat through the water . Length: 4.00 m (13 ft)Width: 1.20 m (3.94 ft)Weight: 75 kg (165 lb)Material: FiberglassKite: North Kite Dyno from 7 sqm – 17 sqm (75 sq.ft - 183 sq.ft)Crew: 1 or 2 . Peter Renssen and  designer Peter Schermer have spent four years developing the boat. 'Years of testing with normal open sailing dinghy’s and prototype resulted in the KiteTender concept,' they said. The unique design was especially created for 'kitesailing' after Renssen saw a kitesurfer in the South of France who was having problems with his knees. The kitesurfer jumped onboard a small fishing boat before launching his kite and sailing the boat to shore. 'That image was stored in my brains for some 15 years,' Renssen told Gizmag. 'As I used to be a sailor, I hated to be located at just one spot or spending a lot of time doing maintenance and rigging. 'So without spending hours to fit the mast you can just find a good spot to inflate your Kite, attach it to the Kitetender, launch it and away you go.' Its inventors say the sport blends traditional sailing and kiteboarding . The pair spent four years developing the prototype for their boat, which is now on sale . There are several variation of the kite depending on how fast the sailor wants to go. 'You can choose a rather relaxed start with a small kite or choose the extreme with a bigger Northkite Dyno in big winds - although for the extreme you’d better be quite experienced,' the firm says. 'Kitesailing is more like sailing, you steer your kitetender with a rudder and you do have a centreboard, and you steer your kite. Within Europe the Kitetender 400 is currently priced at €5,299 (US$7,090) and the Kitetender 650 will cost €19,999 (US$26,750).","Boat can be transported without long mast .

"By . Shari Miller . Preserved for thousands of years, the ancient mummies of Egypt have literally kept their secrets under wraps - until now. Thanks to a new exhibition at the British Museum, the public can finally gain a glimpse into what lies beneath after eight mummies underwent CAT scans at London hospitals, proving the most detailed picture yet of our Egyptian forbears. Ancient Lives: New Discoveries, which opens on May 22, reveals that despite the separation of centuries, the Egyptians suffered from the same health issues that plague us today, including high cholesterol, fatty diets and bad toothache. Unwrapped: Eight mummies from the British Museum, like the one shown, revealed their secrets after undergoing CAT scans . One even sported a tattoo of the Archangel Michael on her inner thigh. John . Taylor, head curator of the British Museum's Ancient Egypt and Sudan . department, said: 'We want to promote the idea these are not objects, but . real human beings. 'We want to capture the humanity of these people.' The mummies came from all walks of life, from royalty to ordinary people living along the Nile. They also lived during different eras - the oldest tested is more than 5,500 years old and dates back to 3,500 BC, while the most recent lived around 1,300 years ago. Some were just youngsters when they died, at around two years of age, while others lived to see their 50th birthday. Using CAT scans, also known as computer tomography, scientists were able to build up a three-dimensional picture of the ancient remains. Some of the bodies were so well preserved that the scan revealed bones, tissue and vital organs. Scientists combined the CAT scan images with carbon dating and infra-red 'reflectography' to build up a detailed picture of their lives. Scans of the pelvic areas also helped the team work out their ages by looking at the wear and tear on their bones. Secrets revealed: CAT scans, like the one pictured, showed how the ancient Egyptians lived, what ailments they suffered and their dietary habits . Two of the eight mummies tested were found to have a build-up in their legs of plaque - essentially cholesterol, calcium and tissue - suggesting they suffered from heart problems. This can be caused by a rich diet high in fat, or it can be genetic. Many experienced poor dental health and had multiple abscesses, which if left untreated, may have led to inflammation of the throat, asphyxiation and ultimately death. Analysis of digestive remains suggested the Egyptians enjoyed a wide diet that included fish, a little meat, beer, bread and sugar-rich fruits, such as dates. Fascinating: The British Museum's latest exhibition, Ancient Lives: New Discoveries, opens on May 22 . One female mummy, aged between 20 and 35 and found in Sudan in 2005, sported a tattoo on her right leg. Exhibition curator Daniel Antoine, who also curates the museum's physical anthropology department, said: 'The tattoo on her right inner thigh represents a monogram that spells Michael in ancient Greek. 'She is the first evidence of a tattoo from this period. This is a very rare find.' The tattoo represents the symbol of the Archangel Michael and one theory suggests it may have provided the owner, who lives in AD 700, with spiritual 'protection'.","Eight mummies from British Museum scanned at London hospitals .

"By . Dan Bloom . It's the moment every cook dreads: realising they have forgotten the most crucial ingredient. Now there is an solution for the world's forgetful chefs - delivering the missing flavour in a fork instead. Inventors in Canada have unveiled the bizarre gadget, which emits smells to make people think they are tasting flavours like ginger, coffee or banana as they eat their meal. Unorthodox: The fork, shown from behind and from the side, has a capsule filled with 'liquid aroma' Whiff: The fork emits smells which waft over the food and reportedly add to the flavour . Collection: The unusual gadget is expected to be released later this year - but a full set will cost £36 . The metal Aromafork comes with 21 different flavours, including chocolate, vanilla, lychee, passionfruit, strawberry, basil, cilantro, mint and almond. Inventive eaters can also plump for coconut, peanut, cinnamon, ginger, jalapeno, wasabi, butter, olive oil, smoke or truffle. It works by having a capsule of 'liquid aroma' underneath the fork's handle, which is then soaked through a small circle of blotting paper and released gradually as the owner eats their meal. The user has to apply the 'taste' each time using a dropper and put a piece of blotting paper in place. Jonathan Coutu, president of the Canadian inventors' firm MOLECULE-R Flavors, said: 'The initial idea was to reinvent the . traditional fork into an improved utensil that would trick people’s . mind by liberating an intense flow of aromas. Creative: An artist's impression of the flavours of lychee wafting over a mouthful of food . Contraption: Users put 'liquid aroma' in the back of the fork using a dropper and it soaks up on blotting paper . He claimed it could become 'the perfect educational tool to learn . how to better appreciate food.' Forgetting to buy ginger will set you back, however - a pack of four forks, a full set of 'tastes' and 50 diffusing papers costs £36. Taste buds on the tongue recognise five primary tastes: sweetness, sourness, saltiness, bitterness, and umami. For differences between, for example, sugar and honey or light soy sauce and dark, the nose must do the rest of the job of picking out the subtleties of each piece of food.","Aromafork claims to recreate lychee, basil, almond, jalapeno and wasabi .

"By . Katy Winter . and Naomi Greenaway . Following the trend for using more diverse models in campaigns, a brand has picked a grey-haired grandmother to not only star in its fashion campaign - but model its swimwear. TK Maxx has picked eight British shoppers to star in their new Spring/Summer 2014 campaign, Me. By Me., including 82-year-old Martin from London and glamorous 62-year-old Olga, who looks fabulous modelling a swimsuit. Olga Taylor, 62, from Twickenham, works in catering at her local college and much to her amazemant she was scouted while shopping in her local TK Maxx. Scroll down for video . Gorgeous gran: white-haired . Olga, 62, models a slash-front swimsuit for TK Maxx's new campaign featuring everyday people . ‘I never expected any of this to happen, I was approached one day whilst shopping at TK Maxx in Twickenham and at first I didn’t take it too seriously. After all, I’m 62!' says Olga. ‘It really is amazing how at my age and just for being myself I have been able to join in such a wonderful campaign and it’s something I really believe in. It makes me feel very proud! ‘The Me. by Me campaign really has been one of the best experiences to happen in my life the past 20 years.' The grandmother, originally from Russia, admits she lacked confidence in front of the camera, until her modelling debut gave her a boost. ‘I have never modelled and I don’t particularly like how I look in photos, but by the end I felt really confident about being myself,' she says. ‘The whole experience has been nothing short of fantastic. I would never have dreamed in a million years at my age this experience could happen.' Olga says the campaign has given her a new outlook on life. She plans to retire from her catering job later this year and live life to the max. Olga admitted being camera-shy before being picked to feature in the new TK Maxx campaign while shopping in her local store. The 62-year-old strikes a pose in a statement orange sun hat (left) and looks chic in tight white trousers (right) 'This campaign has made me realise amazing things can still happen at an older age and life can still be really interesting.' ‘I still can’t believe this has happened; my friends here in the UK and my family in Russia are so excited and proud of me. I am now really looking forward to fully retiring -- there is so much to look forward to.' Justina Taylor is another of the real people scouted by TX Maxx to appear in their Me. By Me. campaign . Olga's secrets to looking fab at 62? 'I try and avoid eating meals after 6pm and I would say my . beauty essentials are fruit and berries. I'm always snacking on them and . they provide so much natural goodness for your skin and body.'

Katella, from Minneapolis, USA, said: 'I love to look plastic - most people hate me for my extreme appearance but it fuels me to get more work done. Strike a pose: Katella admits the look she is going for is 'as fake as you can get' 'I think I do have an obsession with plastic surgery, but being over the top and extreme feels normal to me.'The look I am going for is a walking blow up sex doll - it's about as fake a person as you can be.' Each day Katella goes through a grueling three-hour beauty regime to get ready. And she visits her local salon once a week to have her peroxide extensions cared for. Since her last breast surgery, which took her to an enormous H cup, Katella has struggled to find a surgeon willing to take her bigger. She said: 'Right now the only thing stopping me going to a size L or M is that no surgeons in the US are willing to operate on me. 'I have gone abroad for surgery before so I might have to do it again.' However, her friends fear for her health and have begged her to stop her surgery obsession. Katella's friend, Michel Voeller, said: 'Her obsession with surgery is scary, especially considering the risks involved. 'I've told her she should stop and that she doesn't need any more but she won't listen.'It's definitely getting out of control and could be dangerous.'

Over the years she has had a catalogue of procedures to modify her body including three collagen lip jobs, chin and butt implants and eye reshaping. She said: 'The cost of all of my operations comes to about $100,000 dollars - but I have had boyfriends help pay for some procedures.' Now single, Katella is hoping to find a surgeon willing to take her to a massive M cup.Dr Greg Mesna, of Mesna Plastic Surgery in Minneapolis, believes larger implants would not be a good idea. Dr Mesna said: 'Extremely large implants can erode through the tissues and become exposed.'Also, with larger implants there can be neck, back and shoulder distress from the weight.'I would not recommend Katella get larger implants because of the limitations of her body.' However, Katella remains undeterred. She said: 'I don't worry about consequences or complications. Even if it puts my health as risk I just want to have bigger breasts.'

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Sharks are not known for being particularly friendly towards humans. But divers in the Bahamas have proved that with a little trickery and a lot of courage, they can balance a Caribbean reef shark vertically in the palm of their hands and even stroke the creatures' noses. The underwater explorers have been caught on camera stroking, touching and holding the animals, which can measure 10ft (three metres) long and have been known to occasionally attack humans. Scroll down for video . Underwater magician: One diver in the Bahamas has proved that with a little trickery and a lot of courage, he can balance a Caribbean reef shark vertically in the palm of his hand and stroke its nose (pictured) The Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi) is found in tropical waters in the western Atlantic from Florida to Brazil. It is the most commonly-encountered reef shark in the Caribbean Sea and can measure 10ft (three metres) long. It generally feeds on fish and cephalopods but has attacked humans, mainly as a result of controversial 'shark feedings'. Normally shy of divers, the shark has been known to become aggressive in the presence of food and grows sufficiently large to be considered potentially dangerous. The creatures have been documented resting motionless on the sea floor or in caves, which is unusual behaviour for sharks. Caribbean reef sharks have between 11 and 13 rows of teeth on the top and bottom of their jaws. They are one of the largest apex predators in the reed system and usually feed on fish and cephalopods. One of the divers appears to put a shark into a trance, known as a state of tonic immobility. Tonic immobility is a natural state of paralysis which animals enter but scientists are not entirely sure why they do it. Experts . think 'animal hypnosis' is related to mating in sharks and is used by . other creatures to avoid predators by 'playing dead' and blending in . with surroundings. It can be induced without causing any apparent stress to animals, such as stroking a certain place on a lobster's shell. Sharks can remain in a tonic state for up to 15 minutes.

The underwater explorer has been caught on camera stroking, touching and holding the animals, which can measure 20ft (three metres) long and have been known to occasionally attack humans.

Research has shown that vicious tiger sharks can be put in a ‘trance’ when gentle pressure is applied on either side of their snouts. Some species are ‘hypnotised’ when turned upside down and when they are in a tonic state, their dorsal fins straighten and their breathing becomes more stead and relaxed. Tonic immobility has been observed in a number of shark species and there is a great deal to learn about the benefit that the temporary trance-like state provides, Ali Hood, Director of Conservation at the Shark Trust told MailOnline. 'The state of tonic immobility is used quite extensively as an aid to shark husbandry, or when handling sharks in the wild, limiting the chance of injury to both the shark and the handler. However, there is also some evidence of sharks being induced into such a state for the amusement of tourists. 'The Shark Trust supports well managed ecotourism operations...Tourism ventures which work to engage and train local people and seek to develop a ""live"" value for sharks can make a real contribution to both conservation  and the local economy. 'However, questions should be raised as to just how invasive some ""ecotourism"" ventures have become if inducing tonic immobility has become part of the ""show"". The Shark Trust does not encourage handling sharks in this manner,' she added.

"By . Fiona Macrae . 'You can still finish first without being attractive': Researchers said British winner Bradley Wiggins (pictured) might be bucking the trend . They already get the girl. Now it seems that handsome men also finish first in endurance sports. A study of the elite cyclists in the 2012 Tour de France found that the best-looking men raced ahead. It is thought just as a stag’s antlers are a sign of strength and masculinity, a man’s face advertises his underlying staying power. The Swiss researchers began by showing people head and shoulder shots of elite cyclists from the Tour de France and asking them to rate their looks. They then compared this with how well they did in the race, which covers 2,000 miles in 23 days and is often considered to be the world’s toughest endurance event. As a rider’s overall position is highly dependent on team tactics, the calculation also included the men’s performance when racing in individual time trials. The best-looking cyclists were also the fastest, the journal Biology Letters reports. Importantly, although the men and women judging the photos knew the men were cyclists, they did not know how good they were at the sport. This, said researcher Erik Postma, shows evidence of a link between looks and endurance. He thinks that women in particular have evolved to use a man’s face as quick way of judging his endurance. Good performance: Rui Costa, the reigning world champion, fared well in the study by Swiss researchers . In times gone by, a man with staying power would be able to last the pace when hunting for days on end on the plains of Africa and bring back food for the family. It is also possible that the men who did best were the most competitive and there is something about a determination to win that we find appealing. Frenchman Amaël Moinard was judged to be the most handsome cyclist. Rui Costa, the reigning world champion, also fared well. 'Bradley Wiggins could be a good example of the relationship between good looks and endurance. Or he may show you can still finish first without being attractive' Erik Postmam, University of Zurich . Unfortunately Tour de France winner . Bradley Wiggins and fellow Britons Mark Cavendish and Chris Froome were . excluded from the analysis. Reasons for this included them wearing caps or sunglasses in the official team photos used – making it difficult for their looks to be scrutinised. Dr Postma, of the University of Zurich, said: ‘I have heard mixed reports about the attractiveness of Bradley Wiggins. ‘He could be a good example of the relationship between good looks and endurance.  Or he may show you can still finish first without being attractive - that there is still hope for everyone.’","Women have 'evolved to judge a man's physical prowess from his face'

"By . Hugo Gye . Aaron Whiteside steps back in time whenever he goes through his front door - because his house is decorated just like a typical English home of the 1930s. Ever since he grew up listening to pre-War music, the 31-year-old has been obsessed with the era, and has now spent £10,000 renovating his house in a classic style. Among the home's antique features are rare wallpaper which spent decades buried underground, original art deco fireplaces and an electric cooker which was among the first ever made. Scroll down for video . Vintage: Aaron Whiteside in the living room of his home in Blackpool in a 1930s style . Bedroom: All the rooms in the house are fitted with period fixtures and furniture by the enthusiast . Antiques: Mr Whiteside scours eBay and second-hand shops to find quirky decoration such as this . Unusual: Two ceramic masks of women's faces from the 1930s are mounted on the walls of the home . 'I've been interested in the 1930s since I was really young - about five years old,' said Mr Whiteside, who runs his own glazing company. 'I used to be told stories about the 1930s and we used to listen to the music, so I think that's what's inspired my interest.' He bought his home on a suburban street in Blackpool for £80,000 seven years ago, after it had stood empty for nearly a decade. The enthusiast has worked tirelessly to transform the house - installing German wallpaper which was buried in a time capsule in the 1930s, and cost Mr Whiteside £100 a roll. Unprepossessing: The three-bedroom home is outwardly indistinguishable from neighbouring houses . Playing along: A vintage piano bought by Mr Whiteside, who loved 1930s music as a young child . Old-fashioned:  The kitchen of the house looks like a real relic, without most modern conveniences . Back in time: The front room of the home, which cost Mr Whiteside £80,000 when he bought it seven years ago . He also bought up an early electric heater and three fireplaces - one bought for £400, the other two simply salvaged from a skip. The home is heated in a traditional way too, as instead of central heating it relies on four coal fires. Mr Whitehouse said: 'There's things like wall masts, art deco pictures, radiograms, those are things I've been collecting since I was a child, I've travelled all over the country for things I've wanted. 'I've tried to make sure all the items in the house are originals, rather than being replicas. I even heat my water from the coal fire - which works out much cheaper than the modern way of heating water. Cheery: Mr Whiteside has thrown himself into the 1930s lifestyle, with a particularly sparse vintage bathroom . Poster: An advert for the Blackpool Illuminations dating back to the glory days of Mr Whiteside's home town . Motor: Mr Whiteside, who runs a glazing business, has a vintage car to match his unique home . Eccentric: Mr Whiteside's friends are keen to visit his home and find more vintage collector's items for him . 'Some things have been really expensive, like the wallpaper I got on eBay. I rely on sites like eBay quite a lot, second-hand shops, and my friends all know about it so they recommend things they've seen. 'One of my favourite items are my two suites - the first I bought from eBay, it's by Wilton carpet makers and has the original receipt for when it was bought. It cost £51 and when I got it, it came with a letter from the original owner's son. 'The letter says that average worker would have earned £6 per week back then so this would have been a really expensive piece of furniture back in the day. The other suite dates from 1928 and still has the original material. Pricey: The wallpaper was salvaged from a 1930s German time capsule and cost £100 for each roll . Classic sounds: A wooden radio provides the soundtrack to Mr Whiteside's lifestyle . Pottery: More of the unusual decorative objects Mr Whiteside has managed to unearth . Memories: The 31-year-old was inspired by hearing music and stories from the pre-War era . 'But my pride of joy is a HMV state of the art gramophone from 1937. It came from an old house down south where bits and pieces were being sold off, and a friend of a friend told me about it. 'People are really interested in the house - my friends always ask if they can take pictures, they think it's really different.' Mr Whiteside now plans to paint the front of his house and re-plant the garden, in order to complete his vision of the perfect vintage home.","Aaron Whiteside grew up listening to 1930s music and fell in love with era .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Astronomers have detected what happened in the first billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang. This is a very brief moment of time at the beginning of everything when the universe expanded very rapidly - a theory called cosmic inflation. According to Albert Einstein when something very explosive like this happens it leaves ripples in space-time known as 'gravitational waves'. Scroll down to see the moment the stunned Stanford scientist is told his theory is correct . Gravitational waves from inflation generate a faint but distinctive twisting pattern in the polarisation of the cosmic microwave background, which is the afterglow of the afterglow of the Big Bang . Scientists, from left, Clem Pryke, Jamie Bock, Chao-Lin Kuo and John Kovac smile during a news conference at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge to announce their groundbreaking results . Scientists view the the universe as being made up of a 'fabric of space-time'. This corresponds to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity which was published 1916. Objects in the . universe bend this fabric, and more massive objects bend it more. Gravitational waves are considered ripples in this fabric. They can be produced for instance, when black holes orbit each other or by the merging of galaxies. Gravitational waves are also thought to have been produced during the Big Bang. The very first gravitational waves can tell us about the birth of the universe . and scientists have discovered they leave imprints in cosmic microwave . background radiation - the afterglow of the Big Bang - as they pass . through space. The theory suggests that this intial spurt would have taken the infant universe from something infinitely small to something close to the size of a marble. 'It's just unbelievable quite honestly,' Professor Peter Ade, who helped build the instrument that detected the waves, told MailOnline. 'This is confirming what is, to me, a wacky idea. The next step is quite clear; to confirm the data with another technology.' This graphic shows the universe as it evolved from the Big Bang to now. Nasa scientists believe that the universe expanded from subatomic scales to the astronomical in just a fraction of a second after its birth . The finding by the BICEP2 telescope (pictured) in the South Pole could rank with the greatest discoveries about the universe over the last 25 years . Researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for . Astrophysics in Massachusetts built super-sensitive radiation detectors . and installed them in the BICEP2 radio telescope at the South Pole to . find these 'ripples in the sand.' Nine years later they found these . swirling patterns in cosmic background radiation created by the . gravitational waves caused by the very beginnings of the universe. Many scientists already believed that an initial, extremely rapid growth spurt happened, but finding this evidence has been a key goal in the study of the universe. The results have been described as 'spectacular', and are expected to result in a Nobel prize for the scientists . The discovery gives us a window on the universe at the very beginning when it was far less than one-trillionth of a second old. The work still has to be reviewed by other scientists, but there is already talk of a Nobel prize. 'It's what's I would term Nobel prize winning physics,' continued Professor Ade. 'Just who that prize goes to, however, will be up for debate.' Microwave radiation from the whole sky, captured by the European Space Agency's Planck satellite. Astronomers today announced that they have found 'primordial gravitational waves' - an echo of the Big Bang in which the universe came into existence 14bn years ago. According to Albert Einstein when something very explosive like this happens it leaves ripples in space-time known as 'gravitational waves' A telescope at the south pole, called BICEP2 (Background Imaging of cosmic Extragalactic Polarisation) was used to search for evidence of gravitational waves. The instrument, which scans the sky from the South Pole, examines what is called the cosmic microwave background, the extremely weak radiation that pervades the universe. The background radiation is not precisely uniform. Like light, the relic radiation is polarised as the result of interacting with electrons and atoms in space. Computer models predicted a particular curl pattern in the background radiation that would match what would be expected with the universe's inflation after the big bang. It did this by detecting a subtle property of the cosmic microwave background radiation. This is radiation that was created in the Big Bang and originally discovered in 1964. BICEP2 measured the large-scale polarisation of this microwave radiation. Only primordial gravitational waves can imprint such a pattern, and only if they have been amplified by inflation. ‘It's just amazing,’ added theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss of Arizona State University, who was not involved in the work. ‘You can see back to the beginning of time.’ Another outside expert, physicist Alan Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the finding already suggests that some ideas about the rapid expansion of the universe can be ruled out. Right after the Big Bang, the universe was a hot soup of particles. It took about 380,000 years to cool enough that the particles could form atoms, then stars and galaxies. Billions of years later, planets formed from gas and dust that were orbiting stars. The universe has continued to spread out. Professor Krauss said he thinks the new finding could rank with the greatest discoveries about the universe over the last 25 years, such as the Nobel prize-winning discovery that the universe's expansion is accelerating. The new results were announced by a collaboration that includes researchers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, the University of Minnesota, Stanford University, the California Institute of Technology and Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The team plans to submit its results to a scientific journal this week, said its leader, John Kovac of Harvard. This image shows temperature fluctuations, indicated by variations in colour, of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).  Researchers say since the CMB is a form of light, it exhibits all the properties of light, including polarisation (shown by black lines). The changes in polarisation are thought to be caused by gravitational waves . The 14-billion-year-long history of our universe. It shows the main events that occurred between the initial phase of the cosmos -- where its properties were almost uniform and punctuated only by tiny fluctuations - to the cosmic structure that we see today, ranging from stars and planets to galaxies and galaxy clusters . A telescope at the south pole, called BICEP2 (Background Imaging of cosmic Extragalactic Polarisation) was used to search for evidence of gravitational waves. BICEP2 is shown here in the foreground with the South Pole Telescope in the background . For their research, astronomers scanned about two per cent of the sky for three years with a telescope at the South Pole, chosen for its very dry air, to aid in the observations. They were looking for a specific pattern in light waves within the faint microwave glow left over from the Big Bang. The pattern has long been considered evidence of the rapid growth spurt, known as inflation. Professor Kovac called it ‘the smoking gun signature of inflation.’ The scientists said the light-wave pattern was caused by gravitational waves, which are ripples in the interweaving of space and time that sprawls through the universe. The BICEP2 telescope's focal plane uses novel technology, developed at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, to build an array of devices that use superconductivity to gather, filter, detect, and amplify polarised radiation from the cosmic microwave background.  Each pixel is made from a printed antenna sensitive to polarised millimeter-wave radiation . A full-sky map of the oldest light in the universe. Colors indicate 'warmer' (red) and 'cooler' (blue) spots. Nasa has called this image the best  baby picture  of the Universe ever taken . If confirmed, the new work would be the first detection of such waves from the birth of the universe, which have been called the first tremors of the Big Bang. Arizona State's Krauss cautioned that it's possible that the light-wave pattern is not a sign of inflation, although he stressed it's 'extremely likely’ that it is. It's ‘our best hope’ for a direct test of whether the rapid growth spurt happened, he added. Professor Krauss and other experts said the results must be verified by other observations - a standard caveat in science. Marc Kamionkowski, a theoretical physicist at Johns Hopkins University who didn't participate in the work, called the detection of the light-wave pattern ‘huge news’ for the study of the cosmos. ‘It's not every day you wake up and learn something completely new about the early universe,’ he said.","Using the BICEP2 telescope, scientists looked at specific patterns in light waves within the faint microwave glow left from the Big Bang .

"By . Becky Barrow, Business Correspondent . Families who live in rented homes are spending on average £124 a month more than those who own their properties, a report revealed. The cost of paying off a mortgage has never been lower due to rock-bottom interest rates.In 2008, a typical family spent £945 a month on a mortgage for a three-bedroom house and other buying costs such as insurance and maintenance. A family who were renting a similar property in the same area were spending only £719. Homes for sale: Rock-bottom interest rates mean that it costs £124 a month more to rent than homeowners pay on their mortgage . But the tide has turned against tenants over the past six years. The family who are renting are now paying a record high of £769 a month, and the family who own their home are spending only £645 a month on their mortgage. The calculation is based on a typical family with a 27 per cent deposit on the property and a £126,000 mortgage. The situation has never been worse . for tenants, as there is not a single region where a family who rents is . better off than one who owns, according to the report compiled by . banking giant Halifax. While . mortgages are at their cheapest rates ever, the gap highlights the . nightmare facing families who want to buy but cannot afford the huge . deposits needed to get on to the property ladder in the first place. Buy buy buy: If you can afford it, with rock bottom interest rates it is better to purchase a home than rent . As you would expect, the biggest gap between renters and owners is in London – where a mortgage for a typical three-bedroom house is £1,196 per month, while a tenant is spending £188 more. In England and Wales, the average house price has reached an all-time record of nearly £260,000, according to estate agent LSL Property Services – nearly ten times higher than the typical full-time worker’s salary of £27,000. The report comes as official figures show the number of homeowners has dropped to its lowest since 1987. Latest figures show 65.2 per cent of households in England are classed as ‘owner occupiers’. The number of homeowners has continued to fall for the last eight years, according to the Department for Communities and Local Government’s latest English Housing  Survey. Industry predictions are that the proportion will only get lower – and could eventually drop below 50 per cent. Property buyers have been helped by the Bank of England’s decision to cut the base rate of interest to 0.5 per cent, the lowest in its 320-year history, which dramatically cut the cost of a mortgage. However, with the first increase widely expected to take place next spring, mortgage holders may not be better off than renters for long.","Biggest gap between mortgage payment and rent is in London .

"By . Hugo Gye . A man has been hospitalised after being trampled by a herd of cows while he was out walking his dog in the countryside. Emergency services were called to a field in St Neots, Cambridgeshire last night and rushed the man to hospital. The patient, said to be in his 60s, was badly injured in the accident and required specialist treatment at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Injury: A man was hospitalised after being trampled by cows in a field in Cambridgeshire last night . Experts warned ramblers to beware of cows standing with their calves, as they could become violent while trying to protect their offspring. The farmer who owns the land said that it was unclear whether or not the dog was on a leash when the man took it into the field. Chris Wisson was called by police at the time of the incident and drove the five minutes from his farm in Godmanchester. 'The ambulance crews were just leaving when I got there,' the 35-year-old said. 'As far as anybody knows there was a gentleman there walking his dog in a field in with cows and calves. 'Whether or not he had the dog under control we don't know. It's just one of those things you don't want to happen, but unfortunately animals do follow their natural instincts.' Danger: The man apparently ignored this warning sign posted on the gate into the field in St Neots . Tranquil: But country walks can become dangerous when cows are nursing their newborn calves . A spokesman for the East of England Ambulance Service said: 'On our arrival, the man who we believe to be in his 60s received significant injuries. 'Following treatment, stabilisation and immobilisation by the ambulance crews, he was taken to the specialist trauma centre at Addenbooke's Hospital in Cambridgeshire for further care.' Adam Scott of the National Farmers' Union warned that people in the countryside should stay away from nursing cattle whenever possible. 'If you are walking through a field with cows in it is important to walk quickly and calmly,' he said. 'If you can avoid the cattle then walk around them. 'Most importantly do not get between a cow and her calves. This is where their natural instincts come in to play and you are at risk. Injuries: The man is now being treated at Addenbroke's Hospital in Cambridge, pictured . 'If you have a dog please keep it on a lead. If the dog runs off do not try to protect it, the dog should be able to run away from the cows and will be safe.' Neighbours suggested that the dog walker may not have been able to see the cows when he entered the field. 'A lot of dog walkers do go through the field,' said local resident Lisa Hendry. 'But there is a sign saying ""Beware bull"", and I use common sense and avoid going in there if I know a bull is around. 'However I know there is quite a slope, so it is possible you could walk in there without being aware there is a bull at the bottom.' Police confirmed that they attended the scene, but said that there was no criminal offence committed.","Man in his 60s walking dog in Cambridgeshire field when animals attacked .

"By . Shari Miller . Covered in dust, the paintwork is peeling and the engine won't run for long - but don't be fooled by its rugged condition, for this classic Jaguar is set to heat up the auction rooms when it goes under the hammer. After spending the best part of 20 years rusting away in a barn on the continent, the Jaguar XK150 Drophead Coupe is far from looking how it did in its heyday. In mint condition, the 1958 motor with a 3.4-litre engine developing 250bhp would have had a 0-60mph time of 7.8 seconds and a top speed of 132mph. Bidding war: Although covered in rust and dust, this classic Jaguar is expected to attract a bidding war when it goes under the hammer . The car is regarded as one of the great British sports cars, thanks to its stylish looks and great performance. It was returned to the UK about 18 months ago and the owner, who has kept it locked away, has now decided to sell it. The engine starts, but the Jaguar is a non-runner and will require a full restoration. Despite this, it is being offered with an estimated price of £45,000 - and if a pair of enthusiastic bidders battle it out, the price could run into six-figures. Jaguar barn finds are very desirable at the moment, with collectors buying them in a deteriorated state so they can be part of the restoration process. Over the past two years a number of models have ended up selling for three or four times their estimates. This Jaguar, thought to be the 67th XK150 built, will cross the auction block at the very first NEC Restoration Show on April 12th. Paul Campbell, from Silverstone Auctions, said: 'It will need a full engine rebuild, the interior needs to be refurbished and the body will need to be stripped and repainted.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Pope Francis has acknowledged the existence of a 'gay lobby' inside the Vatican's secretive administration for the first time. Speaking during an audience with Latin American Catholics, the Argentine Pontiff said that there was a 'current of corruption' in the Roman Curia - the central governing body of the Catholic Church. He also admitted the existence of a long-rumoured 'gay lobby' in the Curia, and hinted that he might take action over the issue. Pope Francis has admitted for the first time that there is a 'gay lobby' at the highest levels of the Vatican . Speaking in his native Spanish last Thursday, the 76-year-old told the CLAR (the Latin American and Caribbean Confederation of Religious Men and Women): 'In the Curia, there are truly some saints, but there is also a current of corruption. 'There is talk of a 'gay lobby' and it's true, it exists,' he said, in a report on Chilean website Reflexion y Liberacion.  'We will have to see what we can do.' The Argentine pope has made reforming the Roman Curia—the heavily criticised and intrigue-filled administration of the Catholic Church—a keystone of his papacy, but said it would be 'difficult'. 'I cannot carry out the reforms myself,' he said, explaining that he was 'very disorganised.' For that reason, the task will be handled by a commission of eight cardinals from around the world whom Pope Francis appointed in April to help him govern the Catholic Church. They are set to meet for the first time in October. When the previous Pope, Benedict XVI, announced his decision to retire, many suspected the work of the rumoured gay lobby at the heart of the Curia.

The Ramseys were the focus of intense scrutiny from a media and justice system hungry for someone to blame in the death of the little beauty queen, whose fully made-up face graced millions of magazines. Police initially suspected Patsy Ramsey, herself a former Miss West Virginia, of writing the ransom note herself after killing her daughter, who was found strangled with a fractured skull.

"By . Paul Sims . Hospital staff missed three vital . opportunities to save a toddler with chicken pox and he would be alive . today if they had acted, a coroner said yesterday. Lewis Mullins was seen by doctors . three times in three days after his mother became convinced his . condition was deteriorating rapidly. But on each occasion she was given painkillers to make her son more comfortable and sent home. Grieving: Lewis' mother Jodie Conlay holds her son in a hospital ward. She told an inquest that she 'wished doctors had listened to her' On the morning after the final . hospital visit, 12-month-old Lewis, who had developed a bacterial . infection, was found dead in his bed. Rotherham coroner Nicola Munday said . Lewis would have almost certainly have survived the infection had staff . ‘heeded’ the warning signs, carried out routine tests and treated him. She added: ‘A number of nurses and . doctors were involved in Lewis’s care over a short period of time but . nobody looked at the entire picture. ‘Ultimately this led to Lewis’s death. Had appropriate treatment been given on each of those three occasions . it is likely Lewis would have survived.’ His symptoms and his clinical progress over the three days ‘were not properly heeded and acted upon’, she concluded. The coroner recorded a narrative verdict which said Lewis died from pneumonia, likely to have been caused by the chicken pox. Lewis’s parents, Jodie Conlay and . Andrew Mullins, wept as she delivered the verdict and spoke of the ‘soul . destroying’ moment they realised more could have been done to save . their son. Miss Conlay had provided a ‘clear and . comprehensive’ account of Lewis’ symptoms at the walk-in centre but . significant information was not noted by the nurse and it was not passed . on. ‘Given the significant change in . Lewis’ condition I consider this was the first sign of the bacterial . infection and there was a missed opportunity for investigations and a . possible diagnosis at that time,’ she added. ‘In my view he was displaying sufficient symptoms to warrant further investigation.’ His symptoms and his clinical progress over the three days ‘were not properly heeded and acted upon’, she concluded. Tragic: One-year-old Lewis Mullins plays in a baby walker. He died after contracting chicken pox and doctors missed a bacterial infection three times . Delivering a narrative verdict the coroner said Lewis died from pneumonia which was likely to have been caused by the chicken pox. Miss Conlay and Lewis’s father, Andrew Mullins, 32, wept as she delivered the verdict and spoke of the ‘soul-destroying’ moment they realised more could have been done to save their son. ‘I still can’t believe that Lewis is no longer with us,’ said Miss Conlay. ‘He was such a content baby, a real happy chappie. ‘His big sister keeps telling me she misses her little brother. It has hit both myself and Andrew very hard. ‘Hearing that treatment given to Lewis could have been different and could have saved his life was completely soul destroying. ‘I just hope that changes can be made and more notice taken of parents’ concerns to try and prevent them from having to go through the same heartache. ‘I knew something was wrong but the doctors kept reassuring me.’ Miss Conlay is now calling for a national immunisation programme for chicken pox. Vaccination is routinely available in the United States and Canada, but it is not offered to children in the UK. Miss Conlay, from Maltby, said her son had enjoyed normal health until falling ill with chickenpox after his four-year-old sister, Lacey, caught it. He came out in blisters on his face, was running a temperature, had breathing problems and shaking episodes. His face swelled like he had been in the ring with boxer Mike Tyson, she told the inquest. She rushed her son to Rotherham’s NHS walk-in centre on Wednesday, March 30 last year and was told he had infected chickenpox. But a questionnaire filled in by a nurse, which detailed Lewis’s pain, rash, high temperature, shaking episodes and breathing problems, was not passed to the GP who later saw him. As a result the GP thought he was treating him for chickenpox and nothing more. Lewis returned to hospital the following day and then the third, but on each occasion the chance to intervene with appropriate treatment was missed and he died on April 2. Following Lewis’ death, Rotherham Hospital now gives antibiotics to all children they see with chickenpox. They are also physically examined by a registrar and if needed by a senior doctor within four hours of admission.","Coroner says Lewis Mullins was failed by hospital: 'nobody looked at the entire picture'

Apocalyptic warnings that islands . such as the Maldives will sink beneath the waves are far-fetched, said . Nils Axel-Morner, former head of the Paleogeophysics and Geodynamics . department at Stockholm University. He says that any rise in sea levels is to do with natural historic fluctuations. Opening this year's UN Climate . Conference Mohammed Nasheed, President of the Maldives, warned this his . country was 'an island nation that may slip beneath the waves if all . this talk on climate does not lead to action soon'. While, in his briefing to the convention, Rajenda Pachauri, head of the . International Panel on Climate Change, outlined the dangers science . anticipates unless carbon emissions are curbed. Mohammed Nasheed, President of the Maldives (pictured) said that he leads, 'An island nation that may slip beneath the waves if all this talk on climate does not lead to action soon.' He said that coastal areas and islands are threatened with inundation by global warming. But in a provocative article in the Spectator, Axel-Morner says: 'I have conducted six field trips to the Maldives. I can report that while such regions do have problems, they need not fear rising sea levels.' Axel-Morner said that cycles from the 18th and 17th century proved that current rises were not related to global warming.He said that the IPCC's views on sea-level rises were invalid.. 'Sea level rises are affected by a great many factors, such as the speed at which the earth rotates. They rose in the order of 10cm to 11cm between 1850 and 1940.' 'It is clear that sea levels rise and fall entirely independently of so-called 'climate change',' he said. Alex-Morner claims that data from satellites has been 'tilted' to distort figures - and that a member of the IPCC admitted to him, 'We had to do so otherwise there would be no new trend.' Monyombo Nomphelo, 13, speaks at the UN Climate Change talks in Durban . Pachauri's claims also included that within a decade, up to 250million more people . will face the stress of scarce water. Increasingly frequent weather disasters have imposed heavy financial . burdens, with some poor countries running up 90 perc ent of their . national debt to deal with the aftermath of storms, droughts and floods, . he said.

'Look at the U.S. We use and we welcome their leadership on democracy, . on access to markets, on human rights issues.

"By . Jill Reilly . California is experiencing its worst drought since 1895 with no signs of it abating due to a stubborn ridge of high pressure that is lurking offshore and blocking typical winter weather. Nearly four miles high and 2,000 miles long, it is to blame for the emerging drought as the mass of high air pressure has been blocking Pacific winter storms from coming ashore and bringing much needed to bring rain to the parched West Coast. The duration of the upper-level ridge of high pressure anchored off its north coast - since December 2012 - is unprecedented in modern weather records and puzzling researchers.

The mass of high air pressure has been blocking Pacific winter storms from coming ashore in California, pushing them into Alaska and British Columbia - it is even responsible for rain and cold weather to the East Coast. Similar high-pressure zones pop up all the time during most winters, but they usually break down, allowing rain to get through to California. The duration of its presence - 13 months - is unprecedented in modern weather records and puzzling researchers - it has been named the 'ridiculously resilient ridge.' Source: Sci-Tech Today . Yesterday House Speaker John Boehner . visited a dusty California field joining Central Valley Republicans to . announce an emergency drought-relief bill to help farmers through what . is certain to be a devastating year. If . passed, the bill that's already stirring controversy would temporarily . halt restoration of the San Joaquin River designed to bring back the . historic salmon flow, among other measures. Farmers want that water . diverted to their crops. Standing . on the field just outside of Bakersfield, Boehner said that where he's . from in Ohio, the logic applied in California regarding water policy . would cause people to shake their heads. 'How you can favor fish over people is something people in my part of the world would never understand,' Boehner said. Without the emergency legislation, thousands of farmworkers will be unemployed, he said. The bill is expected to be introduced in two weeks. It calls for allowing farmers to pump from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta as water permits and forms a House-Senate committee to tackle water troubles. Boehner was joined by three Republican colleagues: Rep. Devin Nunes of Tulare, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield and Rep. David Valadao of Hanford. The announcement followed Gov. Jerry Brown's declaration on Friday that California is suffering from a drought. Valadao said Boehner's visit draws the nation's attention to California's dry weather. In turn, each lawmaker railed on Senate Democrats for failing to negotiate with them. A sign warning of uneven bottom at Folsom Lake which is at 17 percent of capacity in Granite Bay .

Left out: American ranchers are not included in the programme, and therefore, do not qualify for any help with the rising cost of feeding their cattle . In a statement, Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein rejected the claim of inaction. Restoration of the San Joaquin River has caused fierce battles spanning years that have pitted farmers in need of irrigation water against groups that wish to bring the salmon runs back to historic levels. 'Salmon, and families (who) depend on them, are the ones we need to act to save now,' John McManus, executive director of Golden Gate Salmon Association, said in a statement. 'Salmon are dying in the drought-stricken Central Valley rivers and soon that will translate into lost jobs on the coast and inland waterways.' The San Joaquin River starts in the Sierra Nevada east of Fresno and collects at the Friant Dam into Millerton Lake. It flows a few miles after the dam but dries up before reaching the Pacific Ocean. The river resumes downstream with water from the Merced, Tuolumne and Stanislaus rivers, which each have salmon population. The river's restoration is estimated to cost $1 billion in federal funds. Among the difficulties, some former river bottom has subsided from pumping, and engineers will need to find ways to send the water uphill along its previous route. Farmland may end up flooding. Farmer Larry Starrh, who opened up his field to the congressional delegation, said the drought has caused his family to make the difficult decision to lay fallow 1,000 acres covered with producing almond trees and leave another 2,000 across of land unused. 'Water is a weapon,' Starrh said as his voice shook with emotion. 'Water is a hostage. Our water system is battered and broken. It's been hijacked by unreasonableness, and we need help.'

"By . Jenny Hope . Experts say 'exciting' research on a drug to combat brain plaques could lead to a generally available pill within five years . A new Alzheimer’s drug that could reduce a crucial component of the disease by 90 per cent is to be tested on thousands of patients. Experts say ‘exciting’ research on a drug to combat brain plaques could lead to a generally available pill within five years. If the trials are successful, the drug would help around 400,000-500,000 Britons deemed at ‘high risk’ of developing Alzheimer’s because they have memory problems in late middle age. In patients with Alzheimer’s, clumps or plaques of a substance called amyloid beta protein stick to brain cells, leading to changes in memory, mood and behaviour. Results from a previous three-month study of 200 patients, and earlier studies, show the drug reduces these amyloid plaques by up to 90 per cent. Both healthy volunteers and Alzheimer’s patients took the drug without any serious side effects.The new trials will involve more than 3,000 patients in 21 countries, including the UK. The first 18-month phase of the study will enrol 1,960 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s, a group that already has significant plaque build-up. The second study, lasting two years, will be carried out on 1,500 patients who are at an earlier stage, with memory difficulties. Dr Craig Ritchie of Imperial College, one of the international team of researchers, said the drug – presently called MK-8931 – is being developed as a pill so that it will be easy to take. ‘If the trials prove it works, it will have to go through licensing procedures, so it will probably take about five years to become available. ‘Around 80 per cent of those developing Alzheimer’s would be eligible, getting on for 400,000 to half a million people,’ he said. The drug, known as a BACE inhibitor (Beta Amyloid precursor protein site-Cleaving Enzyme inhibitor), is an enzyme that removes the sticky amyloid. The trials must show the anti-amyloid effect actually makes a difference to patients with the disease and prevents it from developing in those who merely have memory problems. There have been fears that amyloid might be a by-product of the disease rather than its cause. Dr Ritchie, who is honorary consultant at the West London Mental Health NHS Trust, said the strategy adopted by this drug is completely new. He explained: ‘The aim is to intervene before symptoms take hold. If the trials are successful, the drug would help around 400,000-500,000 Britons deemed at 'high risk' of developing Alzheimer's . ‘People with memory problems aren’t definitely going to get Alzheimer’s but there’s a high likelihood it will affect two-thirds to three-quarters. ‘Other BACE inhibitors have not got far in development. ‘Stopping the formation of plaque early on, when the clumps are small and most toxic, is a fresh approach. ‘There is a great deal of excitement around this in the academic and medical community but there is a huge amount of work to do.’ James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘Previous BACE inhibitors have failed at this hurdle before, though there are important differences between this latest drug and the one that entered previous trials.’ Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘We know Alzheimer’s starts long before symptoms appear, and it’s likely treatments will have more chance of success if given early, so it’s positive to see this drug will be tested in people with early signs of the disease. ‘We await the results of these trials with great interest.’ A blow to the head knocking you out for an instant may be associated with Alzheimer's, researchers say . A blow to the head knocking you out for an instant may be associated with Alzheimer’s, researchers say. They found that older people who have been concussed, and also have memory and thinking problems, have a build-up of amyloid brain plaques linked with dementia. The study, published in the journal Neurology, said plaque levels were 18 per cent higher in individuals who had at some point suffered a concussion resulting in at least a momentary loss of consciousness. This only applied to people who also had mild cognitive impairment, a minor age-related reduction of memory and thinking skills. The US researchers conducted brain scans on 448 people without memory problems and 141 with mild cognitive impairment. The participants, all aged 70 or older, were asked if they had ever suffered a brain injury that involved loss of consciousness or memory. Study leader Dr Michelle Mielke, from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said: ‘Our results add merit to the idea that concussion and Alzheimer’s may be related.’ But Dr Simon Ridley, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘It would be important to see this group followed up for a longer period to better understand the links between head injury and the disease.’","'Exciting' research could lead to generally available pill within five years .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Desperate villagers who have been cut off from the rest of the country by floods for more than three weeks have received help from a floating bridge. The pontoon has been set up along a country road linking the village of Muchelney to the rest of Somserset. The bridge allows villagers to walk part of the journey to dry land, which must still be completed by boat. Muchelney has been inaccessible by land since 2 January, and some parts of the surrounding countryside are 5 feet underwater. Scroll down for video . Pontoon: A construction worker tests the floating bridge linking Muchelney to the rest of the country . Link: The structure will shorten the boat journey between the stranded village and the surrounding land . Deep trouble: The waters around the Somerset village are five feet deep in places . The situation, which has seen villagers rely on volunteer rescue boats for essential supplies, has been declared a 'major incident' in light of forecasts of even more rainfall this weekend. Muchelney, which lies between Taunton and Yeovil, was also devastated last year by the worst floods for decades. A vital boat service operated by Somerset County Council, which is ferrying people to work and school, as well as shipping in supplies, is continuing as the access roads are still flooded. Images of the flooded road shows cars completely submerged, while villagers can be seen canoeing between their homes and the 'mainland'. The floods which have hit Muchelney . have been described as the worst in a century, though the village - the . name of which means 'Big Island' in Saxon - is often cut off by high . waters. The Environment . Agency does not have any severe flood warnings - meaning a risk to life . - in force in Somerset but there are several flood warnings in place. Help: Boat services such as these are the only means of bringing supplies to the village . Flooded: The country road, now a waterway, would usually be surrounding by tall vegetation . Supplies: Parts of the roads are shallow enough to be traversed on foot, left, or by tractor, right, but the villagers of Muchelney are currently reliant on boat services . Damage: Muchelney villager Nick Studley has seen his home ravaged by high waters over the past weeks . Dozens of pumps have been deployed in an attempt to ease the flooding, but an Environment Agency spokesman said it could be weeks before the water is fully removed. The Met Office has issued an amber warning of rain for Somerset with 10mm to 20mm forecast. 'With water levels already . exceptionally high on the Somerset Levels, the public should be prepared . for further flooding,' a Met Office spokesman said. Kerry . Rickards, chief executive of Sedgemoor District Council, said: 'Several . Sedgemoor communities have been severely affected by the floodwaters . for some weeks now. 'With significant rainfall expected over the coming days we feel this situation needs to be escalated as a major incident. 'Sedgemoor . District Council would like to extend its continued sympathy for the . residents, business owners and farmers affected by flooding.' Sunk: The waters surrounding the village are deep enough to cover cars . No respite: The village often floods, and the Environment Agency says it could be weeks before the water subsides . Coping: Villager Elizabeth Nightingale assesses the damage to her home. The village has been inaccessible by land since 2 January . Help: Somerset County Council has extended a boat service to move people at supplies to and from Muchelney . The council said it would continue to provide practical support to residents whose properties are flooded or are predicted to flood. This ranges from the supply of portable toilets where septic tanks are overwhelmed to sandbag collection points in villages and deliveries to the most vulnerable properties. The council said it had provided around 3,000 sandbags in the past few weeks and is also offering housing advice and is on standby to provide temporary accommodation. Somerset County Council is campaigning for the dredging of rivers on the Levels and has recently pledged a further Â£500,000 towards the cost - a move backed by Sedgemoor District Council.","Muchelney in Somerset has been cut off from the rest of the country by flood waters for more than three weeks .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Vice President Joe Biden publicly conceded on Wednesday what many critics of the Affordable Care Act have claimed: The federal government will end the Obamacare open enrollment period far short of its goal. 'We may not get to seven million; we may get to five or six, but that's a hell of a start,' Biden said during a speech in Minneapolis. 'I'm here to say thanks.' The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that in order for the Obamacare system to avoid a financial 'death spiral,' at least 7 million Americans must enroll. More importantly, the nonpartisan CBO projected that more than 2.7 million of them must be young Americans, whose limited use of health care services is expected to balance out the greater needs of older, sicker people. The goal of 7 million new insurance customers has been embraced by members of Congress, the White House, and Health & Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. Biden, shown earlier on Wednesday in Illinois, said the administration will fall far short of its Obamacare enrollment goal . Biden's appearance at Moose & Sadie's cafe, a brief stopover before a major Democratic fundraiser, marked the first time the Obama administration has walked back its health insurance enrollment goals by offering new numbers, although the independent CBO reset its estimate at 6 million this month. Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, has softened the president's position in a different way during recent media briefings. 'When it comes to predictions about how many people will have signed up come March 31st, I don't have an exact number,' he said on February 12. 'What we are confident about is that that will be a large number, and it will be a population that is diverse enough to allow the marketplaces to function effectively.' Last week the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced that total enrollment through January stood at 3.3 million, but the administration has refused to say how many of them have formalized their coverage by paying a first-month premium. A MailOnline analysis of five states that do provide such numbers determined that just two-thirds of the total, or 2.2 million, are likely coverage by insurance. White House press secretary Jay Carney has pivoted in recent weeks, focusing less on the total enrollment goal and more on the 'diversity' of enrollees needed to balance the system between the sick and the healthy . And a McKinsey & Company survey of more than 4,500 Obamacare enrollees in January found that just 11 per cent of them were uninsured before signing up. About two-thirds of those surveyed said they were merely switching from employer-provided coverage. Obamacare's original goal was to provide medical insurance for approximately 25 million uninsured Americans, out of the estimated 48 million who were uninsured in 2012. So far, a large majority of those who have enrolled chose free Medicaid coverage rather than a private plan that would require a premium payment, a government subsidy, or both. Biden, however, enjoys a concierge-style health plan provided by doctors in the U.S. Navy. And, he said Wednesday, he's taken full advantage of it. 'I've been a significant consumer of healthcare,' he told the crowd at the cafe, 'and I'm not bragging about it.' While he was hospitalized for two brain aneurysms, he said, 'all I kept thinking about was, ""Thank God I had all this insurance.""'","The vice president told supporters that 'We may not get to seven million; we may get to five or six'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The nation’s diet has taken a turn for the healthier according to a new survey which found that we are eating out less, consuming fewer total calories and eating better at home. The U.S. Department of Agriculture study, released on Thursday, found that working-age adults consumed an average of 78 fewer calories a day in 2010 compared with 2005. They also reported eating more home-cooked meals with their families and reading nutritional labels on food at grocery stores more often. Food for thought: The U.S. Department of Agriculture study found that working-age adults reported eating more home-cooked meals with their families . The study found that there was a 12.9 percent decline in spending on food away from home during the recession. But the decline in cash-strapped Americans eating out accounted for just 20 percent of the improvements in diet quality, according to the report. The rest was more influenced by ‘an increase in consumer focus on nutrition in selecting foods, changes in the quality of foods available and greater nutritional information available to consumers,’ said Jessica Todd, a USDA economist who wrote the report. Overall, the study suggests that working-age Americans are more aware now of what they eat and are making an effort to adopt some healthier diets. Tightening the belt: Daily caloric intake declined by 78 calories per day between 2005 and 2010 . Respondents reported eating meals with less saturated fat and more fiber in 2010 compared with four years earlier. USDA economists collected data from a total of 9,839 people, using three cycles of surveys from 2005 through 2010. The study offers new evidence that the U.S. obesity problem, while serious, may have stopped getting worse. More than one-third of adult Americans are obese, according to the CDC, up from an estimated 15 percent in 1980. More adults were reading nutritional labels at grocery stores, rising to 42 percent in 2009-10 from 34 percent in 2007-2008, according to the study. Researchers also found that Americans with at least some college education were slightly more likely to eat healthier diets and had a greater decline in calorie consumption than other adults.","Adults consumed an average of 78 fewer calories a day in 2010 compared with 2005 .

"By . Sam Webb . Payout: Maisha Najeeb has received damages totalling millions of pounds after her brain was accidentally injected with glue during treatment at Great Ormond Street . A girl whose brain was accidentally injected with glue during treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital is to receive a multi-million-pound damages payout after she was left with devastating permanent brain damage. Despite having a rare medical condition that involved arteries and veins getting tangled, which could result in a bleed, Maisha Najeeb, of Ilford, Essex, was a healthy 10-year-old until she went into hospital in June 2010. On other occasions, she had successfully received embolisation treatment, which involves injecting glue to block off bleeding blood vessels, and an injection of a harmless dye to check the flow of blood around the brain and head. But on this occasion, said solicitor Edwina Rawson of legal firm Field Fisher Waterhouse, there was no system in place for distinguishing between the syringes containing the glue and those containing the dye, and they got mixed up. This resulted in glue being wrongly injected into the artery to Maisha’s brain, causing catastrophic and permanent brain damage. Today, Judge Birtles at London’s High Court approved a settlement against Great Ormond Street Hospital For Children NHS Trust of a £2.8million lump sum, plus £383,000 a year until Maisha is 19, increasing to £423,000 per year for as long as she lives, which some experts expect to be to the age of 64. The trust, which admitted liability for Maisha’s injuries, repeated its unreserved apologies for the shortcomings in her care, which had such devastating consequences. It said her family had engaged open-heartedly with the trust, which had allowed staff to really learn from what happened to Maisha so that improvements could be made. Neil Block QC, said: 'We can’t wind the clock back. We hope there are now systems and procedures in place to ensure such a tragic mistake cannot be made again. 'While money can’t restore what Maisha has lost, we are sure a great burden has been lifted from the family by coming to the settlement we have.' The glue is used to seal of blood vessels during embolisation treatment. File picture . He said one could not help but be inspired by what Maisha’s parents, Sadir Hussain and Rukshana, had achieved in terms of their 13-year-old daughter’s rehabilitation. Maisha Najeeb suffered severe brain damage when her brain was injected with glue intended to seal off blood vessels at Great Ormond Street Hospital . 'It is probably the most intensive cognitive rehabilitation we have ever seen by a family and we would wish to acknowledge everything they have done for Maisha and wish them well for the future.' The judge extended his sympathy and admiration to the family and said he hoped the compensation would make the rest of Maisha’s life as comfortable as possible. Outside court, Maisha’s father said: 'We are sad and devastated by what happened to our daughter. 'Her life is ruined. All her dreams have been broken. I hope that by bringing this case, lessons will have been learned to avoid this happening to other families. 'We are grateful that agreement has been reached with Great Ormond Street to ensure that Maisha’s care needs are met.' The compensation will be spent on care and accommodation for Maisha, who needs assistance with all daily tasks day and night, is in a wheelchair and has lost the vast majority of her bodily and cognitive abilities. Ms Rawson said: 'What is so heart-breaking about this case is that the injury was so avoidable. 'If the syringes had been marked-up so the hospital could see which contained glue and which contained dye, then Maisha would not have suffered what is an utterly devastating brain injury. 'Such easily avoidable mistakes should not happen.'","Maisha Najeeb, 13, has rare condition where veins and arteries are tangled .

Bits of the toilet paper can still be seen at left . Crausewell told WBRC she was just trying to get rid of a tiny bit stuck to a magnolia tree when the fire quickly escalated. 'It just popped out into a little patch and we tried to put it out and it just kept going, so I was trying to keep it from going down the front porch and came down the bank and around the back of the house,' she said. Unfortunately, she wasn't able to get a handle on the flames and as she rushed to get her mother, elderly aunt and her aunt's caregiver out of the home she called the fire department. Nightmarish: The nightmare blaze was started when Cheryl Crausewell and her son tried lighting some stray bits of toilet paper that hung from a magnolia tree and and the burning TP quickly blew toward the yard . Charred: Shocking footage shows the extent of the blaze, which charred most of Crausewell's yard on its path toward the family home . 'It just popped out into a little patch and we tried to put it out and it just kept going, so I was trying to keep it from going down the front porch and came down the bank and around the back of the house,' said Crausewell . Crausewell told WBRC that firefighters arrived to the scene extremely quickly, but the speed of the flames made them too late. The home, where the family had spent the last 12 years, was a total loss. 'A lot of memories. You know, my son was about a year and a half when we moved here and he doesn't really remember living anywhere else, and this is where we thought we would be for a long time, long time,' she said. Thankful: Firefighters rushed to the scene, but were unable to control the flames before the house was engulfed. Crausewell's son, mother, her elderly aunt and the aunt's nurse were all able to escape . Helping the family out were their church and the American Red Cross. Even the mayor stopped by to show his support. Crausewell has homeowner's insurance she thinks will cover the damage. Right now, though, she's focused on the truly important things in life. 'I just realize life is really precious. I mean, you know that already but it just brings it home how precious life is and all these things really don't matter,' she said. Total loss: The home was gutted but Crausewell said she has homeowner's insurance and plans to rebuild on the same spot.

Mostly they are calling with disbelief at their new found riches followed by the joy at the realisation that they will soon have a seven-figure bank account. Scroll down for audio... Ecstatic: Carly Wiggett (R) and Becky Witt (L), from Dartford, Kent, won £336,277.60 on Friday 22nd March's EuroMillions. They only played the game because their horoscopes told them to . One player, Tracy Tyler, from Epping Forrest, Essex, won the jackpot last month and pocketed £5,819,806. Her voice slightly trembling, she asked the Camelot representative: 'I've just got six numbers on the lottery and I'm having a brain spasm, can you help me?' She tells the operator she's got her ticket in front of her and she's 'shaking like a leaf'. When the full amount is read out, Ms . Tyler responds: 'You're telling me I'm the only winner of the lottery . and I've won £5 million pounds?' as someone is heard yelling in the . background. The operator . sounds almost as shocked as Ms Tyler and says: 'From what you are teling . me with those numbers, yes, that's right, there was only one jackpot . winner tonight. Yes, that's right.

In another recording, Carly Wiggett calls to check if the EuroMillions ticket she bought with her friend Becky Witt, both from Dartford, Kent, is a winner. When it is confirmed the ecstatic girl tells the operator that they only bought the ticket together because of their horoscopes. She . said her star sign told her to 'team up' with someone, and her friend's . said to play the lottery, so they bought a ticket together and chose . the numbers at random.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 20-foot-wide sinkhole has swallowed the driveway belonging to an elderly Florida woman - and neighbors fear it could take her house, too. The elderly resident of the house in Pasco County was able to escape with her two cats, but her car is still trapped in the garage. There's no way to get it out with a five-foot deep hole directly in front of the door. WTSP-TV reports that firefighters evacuated several of the woman's neighbors - fearing the hole could grow and consume their homes as well. Scroll down for video . In too deep: This poor Florida woman had to flee her home after her driveway was sucked in by a sinkhole . Firefighters evacuated her neighbors, as well, for fear that ground could be unstable at their homes, as well . In March, a 36-year-old man died outside Tampa when a sinkhole opened under his bed and sucked him under. If the sinkhole doesn't grow and damaged her house, the woman will likely be stuck to foot the entire bill to repair her driveway. A Florida law ensures that homeowners' insurance only covers damage to the home itself - not to the surrounding property damaged by sinkholes. Sinkhole can be fairly common in the central parts of the Sunshine State. 'I could not believe it until I saw it with my own eyes,' neighbor Joy Zupancic told WTSP. Neighbor Joy Zupancic said she couldn't believe the hole in her neighbor's dirveway . The woman's neighbors have returned - but not without their fair share of unease. 'If you had a sinkhole, you would be worried to. We don't want it to grow,' George Kimball, who lives next door to the hole, said. Sinkholes like those often seen in Florida are caused by acidic water eroding the limestone be beneath the soil. Because of the geological makeup of the Sunshine State, certain areas are more prone to this phenomenon.","Elderly homeowner got out safely .

"By . Hugo Gye . The owner of the ski resort in Kazakhstan where Prince Harry and Cressida Bonas went on holiday is a wealthy oligarch with ties to the dictatorship's political elite. The Shymbulak resort - where the young royal and his girlfriend were spotted recently - is part-owned by Serzhan Zhumashov, whose construction firm is the leading builder of luxury property in Kazakhstan. The oligarch has admitted that he has partly prospered thanks to his political connections - saying that he operates in the 'grey area' between the country's private and public sectors. He has used his estimated £130million wealth to build links with the West - including opening a Kazakh offshoot of a leading English public school. Resort: The ski destination of Shymbulak is part-owned by Kazakh oligarch Serzhan Zhumashov . Kazakhstan has been led by president Nursultan Nazarbayev - an autocratic leader who has suppressed political opposition - ever since becoming independent from the USSR in 1991. Mr Nazarbayev has been accused of human rights abuses including censorship and even torture - but he controversially hired Tony Blair as an adviser on a contract reportedly worth £8million. Mr Zhumashov, believed to be 47, joined the country's finance ministry as soon as he left university, according to U.S. diplomats. In 1996 he went on to found Capital Partners, the construction company of which he remains chairman, and built up strong links with leading firms in the West. Couple: Prince Harry and Cressida Bonas, pictured skiing last year, recently visited the Kazakh resort . Project: Mr Zhumashov built the resort in the mountains above Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city . Among the projects masterminded by Mr Zhumashov's firm have been cinemas, fitness clubs and restaurant chains such as pizzerias, sushi bars and American-style diners. His businesses have helped meet the growing demand for a Western lifestyle in the ex-Soviet state where GDP per head is still below $10,000 (£6,000). However, Capital Partners' plans to build further ski resorts after the success of Shymbulak have attracted opposition from campaigners who claim they could prove an ecological disaster. Mr Zhumashov's most recent major project was the construction of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Almaty, the biggest city in Kazakhstan. The five-star hotel - which calls itself 'the first true luxury location in Kazakhstan' - is located at the top of Almaty's tallest skyscraper, and prices for its rooms start at around £200 per night. School: The businessman teamed up with Haileybury College in Hertfordshire, pictured, to found a new private school in Kazakhstan . The oligarch told U.S. diplomats that Capital Partners relies on 'the grey area where private investment and the government intersect', according to a 2008 document released by WikiLeaks. This suggests that Mr Zhumashov is close to the Nazarbayev regime, although he has also spoken out against the government at times. While most of his business investments have been in his native country, Mr Zhumashov has also bought property in the West - in 2010, he sold an apartment in Manhattan for $3million (£2million). He sent his son to Haileybury College in Hertfordshire, the £30,000-a-year boarding school attended by film director Christopher Nolan and former Prime Minister Clement Attlee. Mr Zhumashov helped Haileybury set up a pair of sister schools in Kazakshstan, Haileybury Almaty and Haileybury Astana, at a cost of at least $100million (£60million). When Haileybury Almaty first opened in 2008, Mr Zhumashov said: 'We decided to do it so our children could stay here and at the same time get the education that would allow them to enter any university.' He has expressed ambitions to team up with Ivy League universities in order to set up a business school and medical school in Kazakhstan.","Prince and his girlfriend were seen at the Shymbulak resort in Kazakhstan .

Buddy the Labrador was covered in dust when he was pulled from the debris of his family's house in Darrington on Sunday, lifting spirits in a time of unimaginable heartbreak. Buddy and a cat were inside the home while their family, the Kuntzes, were at a baseball game on Saturday morning. When they returned home, they found the house 100 feet from its base. Scroll down for video . Discovery: The Kuntz family heard a noise as they searched the rubble of their home after the mudslide . Found! Buddy the chocolate Labrador was pulled from the debris on Sunday after relatives heard him moaning . Safe: Buddy was covered with dust and a few cuts but otherwise unharmed by the mudslide . The family had given up hope of finding their animals in the home - a farm that has been in the family for five generations - but returned the following day to see what they could salvage. 'We were looking through all the rubble and we heard the dog whining,' one of his owners, Quinton, told KBOI. They managed to pull the beloved pet from beneath the collapsed farmhouse and carried him to safety. He gave one shake of his dust-covered fur and began walking with ease. 'I . just broke down crying, really happy that my dog was alright,' Quinton . said. 'I'm just shocked how well he did against my whole house falling . on him.' Back on his feet: Buddy shook off the dust after being pulled out and was back to his normal self . Reunited: His owner Quinton Kuntz said he was shocked that his dog had survived after the house fell . The Kuntz family did not find their cat but they are now helping to rescue other animals whose homes were caught in the mudslide. The moment of joy came amid heartbreak for the family, who lost an aunt, Linda McPherson, 69. Mrs McPherson, who had grown up on the family farm with her sisters, lived in a house next door to the Kuntzes and was at home with her husband Gary when the ground started to give way. Gary McPherson was able to grab wood from his recliner chair, which he used to make space for him to breathe. Wrecked: Brian Anderson, left, and Coby Young search the wreckage of the Kuntz family farm, which had been in the family for five generations before it was destroyed in Saturday's mudslide .

'We have lost a great, great sister, but we're a strong family and we're going to get through this,' said Linda's sister, Irene Kuntz. The family, including Buddy the dog, are now staying with other relatives. Authorities have confirmed 14 fatalities following Saturday's mile-long mudslide, and there are as many as 176 people unaccounted for. The search continues for victims trapped in the debris.

"By . Hugo Gye . Police have been forced to step in and move foolhardy weather-watchers away from the shore amidst fears that people were endangering themselves by getting too close to giant waves during a day of stormy weather. A family in Cornwall narrowly escaped being swept into the sea when a 20ft wave washed over them as they were walking along a sea wall. And a group of young men in Shoreham, Sussex risked their lives by playing around on the narrow ledge of a wall as waves crashed around them. Danger: A young family walking along a sea wall in Mullion Cove, Cornwall during stormy weather yesterday . Wave: The family were suddenly engulfed by a huge surge which crashed over the top of the wall . Do you know the family who were nearly swept away? Contact hugo.gye@dailymail.co.uk with any information. The Environment Agency criticised people who lined the shore to watch the waves battering Britain's coasts. 'Clearly . it is dangerous to get too close to these waves,' a spokesman said. 'There is colossal power in these waves that can knock people off their . feet. 'We would advice . people to keep well away. There have already been two fatalities this . year already and we urge you not to add to those statistics.' At . Mullion Cove in Cornwall, which is almost the southernmost point in all . of Britain, a father, mother and three young children were photographed . walking along a barrier when a 20ft wave came over the top of the wall, . drenching all four members of the family. The incident could have . been extremely dangerous for the parents and children, who were in the . middle of a narrow walkway and were nearly swept into the sea. Aftermath: The family looked completely drenched after the wave came crashing down over them . Recovering: The parents and children were hit by another smaller on a different part of the wall . But thankfully, the unidentified family appeared to be unhurt - even if they were left extremely wet. Onlooker . Phil Rodda, who was standing at a safe distance during the incident . yesterday , said he was shocked to see the family exposing themselves to . potential danger. 'We . could see the young family, a man and a woman with three or four kids in . all,' he said. 'The man was lifting his little girl up against the . railings so she could get a better view. 'Suddenly . this huge wave came crashing over the harbour wall and knocked the dad . off his feet. He fell back onto the ground, still clutching the girl - . they were very close to being swept away. 'The mother then ran over and grabbed the girl before they traipsed off looking drenched and rather sheepish. 'Anyone . who knows the sea around here knows what it's capable off so I'm . guessing they were from out of town. It was a ludicrous thing to do and . incredibly dangerous.' Reckless: Three young men were seen standing on top of a sea wall in Shoreham, Sussex today . Lucky: The boys were fortunate not to have been knocked off as huge waves broke around them . The incident happened in the same harbour where a holidaying couple were swept to their deaths during a seaside stroll in 2007. Elsewhere, . sightseers who flocked to the coast to witness the dramatic scenes were . ordered to move by officials amidst fears they were putting their own . lives at risk. Carmarthenshire County Council called . in the police to move on sightseers who turned out in large numbers at . Burry Port, in south-west Wales. The . coastal town, which sits on a tidal estuary, was lashed by huge waves . and winds of more than 70mph during the morning high tide. Sightseers . were using a car park close to the town's RNLI station which was a . potentially dangerous area because of debris being thrown out of the . sea. Warnings: Police and environmental officials are urging members of the public to stay away from the coast . Crashing: Many people went to the shore to see the dramatic scenes for themselves . A total of 21 severe flood warnings - suggesting conditions so bad that lives will be at risk - are in place across Britain. Areas . are already under water but South Wales and North Devon are set to be . worst hit tonight with 10.4m high tides hitting Porthcawl and 9.7m . hitting Ilfracombe at around 7.30pm. Waves . of 30ft have been consistently hitting the coast since the . pre-Christmas storms. The waves are pushed in from the South Atlantic . and crash straight into the West Country off the Atlantic Ocean. Residents of low-lying areas have been warned to pack their bags because the violent Atlantic storm is expected to overwhelm large parts of the nationâ€™s battered flood defences. The Environment Agency has issued 21 severe flood warnings for the Midlands and western areas, warning residents of danger to life. Some 437 less severe alerts were issued for other parts of the country as forecasters warned of winds of up to 60mph and days of rain.","Family were walking along sea wall in Mullion Cove on Cornish coast .

He told a court her unborn child was at risk saying she was 'helpless.' Chief Assistant Public Defender Craig S. Dyer suggested Wilkerson's actions resulted from inhumane conditions. He said at the time she was being held naked in an isolation cell. Dyer argued that Wilkerson should have her $1.2million bond suspended and she should be admitted to Halifax Health for care. 'I believe that Mrs. Wilkerson can be helped,' said Dr. James Moore, a psychiatrist. He described Wilkerson's detention as so restrictive that it will complicate mental health treatment. 'She's limited in her ability even for such things as getting fresh air.' The judge also heard from Dr. Pamela Carbiener, an obstetrics and gynecology specialist, who said Wilkerson's pregnancy is complicated by several factors and she has risk factors for premature birth. 'I think she has significant high-risk issues,' Carbiener said. Judge Leah Case declined to release Wilkerson to the hospital at that point. Unstable: The pregnant South Carolina woman who drove the minivan carrying her three young children into the ocean surf had talked about demons before leaving the house . Safe: A lifeguard carries one of the three children rescued from the minivan . That's when she set up today's follow-up hearing, inviting the defense to provide case law supporting its proposal. Wilkerson's family has said she drove into the water days after leaving her husband, following 14 years of abuse in South Carolina. Her children have told investigators she had been behaving erratically since arriving in Florida. Tourists on the beach caught the horrifying ordeal on camera, and the footage shows that Wilkerson was physically able to escape the vehicle. In video taken by Simon Besner, a . tourist from Canada, the woman can be seen outside the van as lifeguards . try to pull her children from the vehicle. Witnesses . described her hopping out of the car window as her screaming children . remained seat-belted in the back. Waves nearly pushed her . under the van. 'It was a bit terrifying,' said Besner.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A janitor at an elementary school in New Jersey responsible for causing a blaze that essentially burned the entire building to the ground over the weekend says he's sorry for what happened and he's just thankfully nobody was injured. Jerome C. Higgins, 48, is a custodian at the James Monroe Elementary School in Edison. On Saturday, Higgins tossed a lit cigarette into a trash can in the custodians office. About 7:45 p.m., the lit cigarette had grown into a huge blaze that ultimately consumed much of the building. Oops: A janitor at a New Jersey elementary school nearly burned the entire building down with a cigarette . 'I’m sorry I just can’t believe this, my heart goes to the children,' Higgins told Pix11.com.  'As long as nobody was hurt, that’s God’s grace.' It took firefighters more than three hours to extinguish the fire caused by Higgins' cigarette, and nearly a dozen were treated for smoke inhalation. Luckily, no other injuries were reported. Higgins has been issued a summons for a petty disorderly persons offense for smoking inside the school. Under New Jersey law, 'smoking and/or carrying lighted tobacco materials' in a school is against the law. According to Pix11, the school is home to about 500 kindergarten through fifth-grade students. Sorry: Janitor Jerome Higgins says he's just glad that none of the children were hurt in the fire he caused . The school is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. 'I think it was very careless mistake by someone I trusted,' school district Supt. Richard O’Malley said during a meeting for parents in the auditorium of a local high school. Authorities say that the summons issued to Higgins is the most they can do under the law - because there was no intent to burn the school down, or start a fire at all, the janitor can't be charged with arson. Some parents aren't thrilled with the charges, and say Higgins' demeanor as the school burned was a little odd. Classes canceled: The students at James Madison will not have class again until Wednesday and will use classrooms at a local college . 'The thing that I thought was a little unusual was he was pretty calm,' Edison resident Karen Halo tells CBSNew York. 'Like if I was the last person in the . building and the building was in a fire, I don’t know if I would be . quite so calm and collected.' Students will not have classes until Wednesday when they will use classrooms at Middlesex County College for lessons.","Janitor Jerome Higgins threw a lit cigarette into a garbage can at James Monroe elementary school on Saturday .

"By . Sean Poulter . Tattoo and piercing services have joined the group of Britain’s fastest growing high street shops as Britons aim to emulate celebrities like David Beckham and Cheryl Cole. There was a net increase of 89 in the number of tattoo specialists in the UK in 2013, which represents a rise of almost 12 per cent. Despite being lambasted as ‘tramp stamps’, an increasing number of people from all walks of life are turning to body art, delivering an air of respectability. Cheryl Cole has tattoos all over her body including on her back, thigh, neck and bottom . The example is being set by everyone from Olympic sporting heroes like Victoria Pendleton to the Prime Minister’s wife, Samantha Cameron, who has a dolphin on her ankle, and the respected BBC journalist David Dimbleby, who opted for a scorpion on his shoulder. The numbers have been published as part of a new high street survey which reveals independent entrepreneurs are opening shops at a faster rate than the big chains are putting up the shutters. Figures published today show that while the big chains closed outlets at the rate of 16 a day in 2013, independent stores opened at a much faster pace of 44 a day. The biggest increase was seen in mobile phone shops as the smartphone becomes a modern day essential with the total up by 157 in 2013 or some 23.93per cent. The second biggest rise was for barbers with a rise of 136 outlets, while there was also a net increase of 107 in the number of beauty salons. Fourth on the expansion list were tattoo and piercing parlours with a net increase of 89, ahead of charity shops, with a rise of 88, and nail salons at 87 . The biggest fall was in shops specialising in women’s clothes as chains scale back the number of high street outlets with people increasingly buying fashions and shoes online. Sports personalities also favour the body artwork. Victoria Pendleton has a tattoo on her arm and David Beckham has tattoos on his arms and chest . The research, conducted by the Local Data Company, found a net fall of 140 in specialist women’s clothes shops, while there was also a fall of 49 in general fashion shops and 48 in shoe shops. The move to shopping online was also reflected in a drop of 43 in the number of furniture shops. The figures also found a reduction of 75 in the number of newsagents in 2013 as they struggled to counter competition from the hundreds of convenience stores selling magazines and newspapers opened by the big supermarkets. There was also a fall of 62 in the number of jewellers. The cost of living squeeze has seen a rise in the success of budget supermarkets, however the research found a net fall of 56 in pound shops and general discount shops. Pubs continued to struggle in 2013 with a net fall of 44 as people suffering a cost of living squeeze cut back on nights out, while there were also 47 fewer bars. Samantha Cameron has a dolphin tattoo on her ankle . Michael Weedon, the deputy chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, said: ‘Independent tailors, bakers, barbers, grocers, hairdressers, confectioners, coffee bars are on the rise as towns see them replace fashion and shoe shops, jewellers, newsagents and booksellers. ‘As chains cut their links one by one with high streets our towns are showing signs of reverting to older models of economic activity, where they serve the needs of physical customers in physical stores, alter their clothes, style their hair and mend their broken iPhones. ‘The churn is huge, with more than 15,000 independents closing in 2013 - but nearly 16,000 opening their doors for the first time. It is not a fluke. It is consistent. ‘Give an entrepreneur a sniff of an opportunity and a chance of a profit and they will create businesses and fill empty units.’ Matthew Hopkinson, director at the Local Data Company, said: ‘Against all odds Independent retail and leisure businesses have continued to grow in our town centres. ‘The propensity of independents to survive and thrive varies massively by place, as does the churn rate. ‘Clearly the appetite is there and increasingly independents are adjusting to the new challenges of the total retail world  - online and offline - as well as the competition they face from their big ‘chain’ brothers. 'Independents are an important part of every town and are the one thing that drives diversity in what has become a homogenous world.’ David Beckham visited this tattoo parlour in Middleton, Manchester for a consultation in 2003 .","Number of tattoo parlours in UK rose by 12 per cent in 2013 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A nine-year-old girl who shaved her head in support of a friend with cancer has been barred from her school for violating its dress code.

Support: Kamryn Renfro (left) shaved her head to support Delaney Clements, (right) who lost her own hair after undergoing chemotherapy to treat her childhood cancer - but Kamryn was barred from school . 'It made me feel very special and that I'm not alone.' But Kamryn's school, Caprock Academy, said she could not attend classes because girls' shaved heads violated the dress code policy. The school told her she could not return to class until she wore a wig or her grew her hair back. Kamryn's mother emailed the school . explaining why the little girl had chopped off her braids, but - at first - administrators . said they were unable to exceptions.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated Press . A newlywed has pleaded guilty to a second-degree murder charge after being accused of pushing her husband off a cliff just eight days after their wedding. Jordan Linn Graham, 22, agreed to plead guilty in exchange for waiving a first-degree murder charge and a lying to investigators charge, the prosecutor in the case revealed in court on Thursday. The development came before a jury was set to begin considering the case against Graham. She could face a maximum sentence of life in prison when she is sentenced on March 27. She was accused of killing Cody Johnson, 25, by pushing him over a cliff in Glacier National Park in July, with prosecutors claiming she was having serious second thoughts about the marriage. Plea deal: Jordan Graham, pictured center on Tuesday, has agreed to plead guilty to second-degree murder in the death of her husband, who she pushed off a cliff eight days after their wedding . First-degree murder means the crime is premeditated. But . her defense team had argued that his fall came after an argument and . that Graham had initially lied to police because she was afraid she . wouldn't be allowed to explain what had unfolded. Her husband disappeared July 7. Four days later, Graham led friends and relatives to the park, where they found Johnson's body, initially claiming she had found him after a search. Graham concocted a story that her husband had gone off . with friends and had not returned. Earlier on Thursday, defense attorneys wrapped up their case without testimony from Graham. Instead, they showed the jurors pictures and videos of Graham smiling as she had her hair done and tried on her wedding dress, then videos of the June 29 wedding and the couple's first dance. Those images attempted to chip away at the prosecution's image of Graham as a cold, dispassionate woman who didn't want to marry Johnson, and their contention that eight days later she led him to a dangerous precipice in the Montana park and deliberately pushed him to his death. Before tragedy: Graham is pictured with 25-year-old Cody Johnson, whom she married in June. Johnson's mother testified in the trial that her son had been excited to marry Graham . Hearing her words back: More than a week after her husband died, Jordan Graham was interviewed by FBI officers and she is heard on tape saying that she 'pushed him and took off' In earlier testimony, the coroner revealed that Johnson . was not wearing his wedding ring when he was found at the bottom of a ravine and had an 8-inch gash on his forehead. The . plea deal on Thursday followed dramatic evidence in the courtroom in . Missoula, including an FBI interview in which Graham admitted that she . had shoved . ‘I pushed him and I took off,’ she said to an FBI agent in the recording. On the tape, Graham calmly told . FBI agent Stacey Smiedala that she and Johnson were having a fight and . decided to drive to Glacier to discuss their issues. While . venturing off trail near the Loop, Graham said Johnson grabbed her arm. Graham then took Johnson's hand off her and pushed him over the cliff. 'It . was a quick thing, I just wanted to get him off me,' she said in the . recorded interview. 'I don't feel like I killed him; I mean I pushed . him, but it was an accident.' Tough case: Graham, seen here with members of her legal team, was in court when they played a video interview of her telling an FBI agent about how she pushed her husband off a cliff in Glacier National Park . Under scrutiny: Graham, pictured outside the court, had maintained she pushed Johnson in an argument . Johnson . died on July 7 but his body was found days later when Graham led a . search to the specific spot where she knew he was after initially . denying that she had any idea where he had ‘disappeared’. Flathead . County deputy coroner Richard Sine took the witness stand on Wednesday and said Johnson also had lacerations on . his legs in addition to the laceration on his forehead. Sine also testified that Johnson's shoes were found some distance from his body. One explosive revelation came when the coroner mentioned a black cloth near Johnsons’ body. Defense attorneys were to argue against . the use of the cloth as any form of evidence, saying that it was handled . inappropriately during the investigation. The prosecution had claimed that . Graham may have blindfolded her husband before pushing him in the back . with two hands as he plunged face-first off the cliff. Happier times? Graham and Johnson pictured during their first dance at their wedding days before his death . A mother's anguish: Cody Johnson's mother Sherry (left) told the court that when she said something comforting to Jordan at the funeral, she didn't respond . Johnson’s mother also testified and said that her son was excited to marry Graham. She added that she tried to console Graham during a prayer service after her son's death. 'I put my arm around her and said everything will be OK,' Sherry Johnson said tearfully. 'Cody's with Jesus now.' Rather than saying any words of comfort to her grieving mother-in-law, Mrs Johnson said that Graham stayed quiet and did not respond.","Jordan Graham pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for waiving a first-degree murder charge and a charge of lying to investigators .

"By . David Mccormack . A 24-year-old Reddit user got the shock of her life on Wednesday when she discovered that the Secret Santa gift she’d just received via the website’s annual exchange was from none other than Bill Gates. Rachel, the lucky recipient of the Not-So-Secret Santa present from the world’s richest person, received a $40 travel book, a $25 stuffed cow along with an undisclosed donation to the non-profit Heifer International. When Rachel first found a card along with her gifts explaining who it was from, she admits her initial reaction was that someone was playing an elaborate prank on her until she found an attached photo of the Microsoft founder holding her gifts. Not-So-Secret Santa: To prove it was really him, Gates included this photo with the presents he sent to Rachel . Reddit user Rachel poses with the coffee table book that was part of her Secret Santa present from Bill Gates . ‘My god. Never in my entire life did I imagine, ever, ever, ever that Bill would get me,’ wrote Rachel in a Reddit post revealing her highly usual Secret Santa experience. Rachel posts on the social media site under the username NY1227 and describes herself as someone who ‘love nails and makeup! I also love to travel, particularly to the Caribbean and Europe.’ On Monday she received an email informing her that her gift - which weighted a whooping seven pounds - was being shipped to her overnight. It wasn’t until Wednesday that Rachel had time to open her gift, but she was so excited to see what was in it that she decided to document the opening of the present by talking photographs of the contents. Rachel also received this note explaining the significance of her present - a stuffed cow . ‘The first thing I noticed was a stuffed animal. I didn't know I gave off the stuffed animal vibe, but I excitedly added him to my collection of teddy bears and other delightful friendly creatures,’ she wrote. Next she found an envelope which read ‘To me, from Bill’. ‘I thought Bill sounded like a friendly fellow. In fact, I had this whole image of this poor guy named Bill trying to navigate my wishlist full of makeup, nailpolish, glittery things to buy me,’ wrote Rachel. ‘Quite frankly I felt bad for this Bill since I'm a self-identified pain in the ass to shop for.’Inside envelop was a note informing Rachel that Bill had donated to Heifer International, a nonprofit seeking to end poverty and hunger, in her honor. ‘I took a break from my present to research the charity a bit, and now the stuffed animal cow made sense,’ wrote Rachel, ‘I was so excited, the cause seemed really worthy and amazing, and it is the season of giving.’ The stuffed cow which Rachel has added to her collection of teddy bears . The final part of her present, also the largest, was a large travel book called Journeys Of A Lifetime, no doubt inspired by her posts about liking travel. Inside the book was also a note explaining her presents and which was signed Bill Gates. As it dawned on Rachel who her Secret Santa was, she was also suspicious that it might be an elaborate hoax until she spotted a photograph of Gates holding her stuffed toy and the note that she had just read. ‘I feel SO shocked and excited that not only did I receive a gift from Bill, but it was perfectly and EXACTLY tuned into my interests. My gosh, what a rush!!’ she wrote. In her Reddit post explaining the whole incident, Rachel thanked Gates for ‘an amazing gift and Secret Santa experience.’ When Rachel first opened her present she noticed this envelope, but little did she realize that the Bill in question was actually Bill Gates .

'I am so very, very grateful for the amazing and thoughtful gift you have picked for me!’ Rachel also ended her Reddit post with an apology to Gates: 'ps: Sorry for the apple ipad on my wishlist, that was really awkward.' It isn’t clear how much Gates, the world's richest person in 2013 according to Bloomberg Billionaires List, donated to Heifer International, but Rachel speculated, ‘I can only imagine it was QUITE a bit.’ The charity gives livestock, seeds and trees and extensive . training to those in need and has helped more than 79 million people in more . than 125 countries.

"By . Louise Boyle . A 22-year-old college undergraduate has been sentenced to a year in prison for stealing the identities and passwords of more than 700 fellow students at his university so he could rig a campus election. Former Cal State San Marcos student Matthew Weaver rigged the election so he could become student body president, the U.S. attorney's office said on Monday. He was one of two candidates for the position at the San Diego area school in March last year. Arrogance: Former Cal State San Marcos student Matthew Weaver has been jailed for a year after attempting to rig an election to make himself student body president . Weaver, of Huntington Beach, pleaded guilty in March to wire fraud, unauthorized access of a computer and identity theft. The third-year business student admits that he bought three small electronic devices that record a computer user's keystrokes to steal 745 passwords. Weaver says he used those stolen identities to cast about 630 votes for himself and for friends who also were on the ballot. The 22-year-old had searched terms including 'how to rig an election' and 'jail time for keylogger' online. His plot was uncovered when university IT staff notice strange activity on a college computer. Weaver was arrested sitting at a campus computer. Judge Larry Burns, who rejected the student's plea for probation, said that Weaver then made the situation much worse by trying to cover up his crime. In the running: Weaver was on the list of candidates but decided to bypass the traditional voting process . Rules: The student at Cal State San Marcos (pictured) bought electronic devices which register key strokes and hacked other students' accounts and registered their vote for himself . The judge told U-T San Diego: 'Heâ€™s on fire for this crime, and then he pours gasoline on it to try to cover it up.' After he was caught out, Weaver and his friends created fake Facebook pages using real students' names to frame them for the crime. 'Conversations' from these pages were sent to various media outlets - but no one believed the ruse. His defense lawyer said that Weaver was young and had made 'stupid decisions' for which he had apologized. The cost of Weaver's scam cost Cal State San Marcos $40,000 which they will be seeking from Weaver. The Assistant U.S. Attorney Sabrina Feve described him as 'an incredibly entitled young man'.","Matthew Weaver, 22, will spend one year in federal prison in California after pleading guilty to wire fraud and identity theft ."
"By . Lydia Warren . A newlywed who admitted to pushing her husband off a cliff eight days after their wedding was scared of having sex with him, a source has claimed. Jordan Graham, 22, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the death of Cody Johnson, 25, last week after his body was found at the bottom of a ravine in Glacier National Park, Montana in July. Prosecutors claimed that Graham had shoved him over the edge of the cliff as she was having doubts just days after their wedding, but she claimed it was an accident during an argument. Now, sources have told the National Enquirer that she was fearful of having sex with him. 'Scared': Jordan Graham, pictured leaving court last week, was scared of having sex with husband, a source has claimed. Graham pleaded guilty to pushing him off a cliff days after their wedding . 'The thought of having sex with her husband made he physically ill, and she would fly into a panic,' the source said. 'It made him frustrated. Jordan believed Cody was going to want her to do all sorts of kinky things in the bedroom. She was afraid.' In court, Jodran's matron of honor, Kimberly Martinez, had testified that Graham had texted her saying Johnson would ask her to 'do stuff I'm not wanting to'. When Martinez told her to tell her husband how she felt, Graham responded: 'I feel like it's my job to make him happy, even if I'm miserable.' Graham, 22, said she decided to talk to Johnson, 25, about her unhappiness eight days after their wedding. So on the evening of July 7, just about sunset, the couple went to a popular spot in Glacier Park called The Loop. Unsure: Prosecutors said she pushed Cody Johnson because she was having doubts about their marriage . Happier times: An image from their wedding on June 29 shows the couple days before his death . They went over a retaining wall along the Going-to-the-Sun Road and climbed down a rocky, steep slope to the edge of a cliff and a steep drop of a couple hundred feet to a ravine. There, facing the void, she told Johnson that she wasn't really happy and that she was not feeling like she believed she ought to after being married, she said. They argued. It escalated, culminating with Johnson grabbing her, Graham said. She thought he was going to pull her toward him - and that's when she became angry. 'I wasn't thinking about where we were,' she said. 'I just pushed.' She said she brushed away his hand and then pushed her new husband with one hand on his back and one hand on his shoulder, and he went over. It wasn't planned, but she said it was 'definitely reckless with an extreme disregard' for life. Afterward, she ran back to where the car was parked. She had the keys in her pocket. Guilty: Graham, pictured with her defense attorneys last week, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder . Heartbreak: Cody Johnson's mother Sherry breaks down outside the court following Graham's guilty plea . She drove back home to Kalispell, about an hour away, without seeking help. She sent text messages to friends on the drive back - but told nobody what had just happened. 'At that moment, I was so scared, I didn't know what to do,' she said. On Thursday, Graham, 22, changed her initial not guilty plea and admitted that she did push her husband to his death, accepting a lesser second degree sentence. The prosecution was planning on showing the taped interviews with the court room but since she accepted the plea, the jurors did not have to consider the evidence. Second-degree murder carries a maximum sentence of life in prison and a $250,000 fine. She is scheduled to be sentenced on March 27.","Jordan Graham pleaded guilty last week to second-degree murder in the death of Cody Johnson in July - just days after they wed .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . There are faster ways to get a message to someone, but there's something enchanting about the way one New York teenager delivered a note to its recipient. Connor Corbett-Rice, 15, from Shelter Island, tossed a bottle into the Atlantic Ocean near his home in 2011, as part of school project. Three years later, he received a much faster reply - by email. Cast away: The bottle was sent out to see off the Long Island coastline at Shelter Island, New York . Roundabout route: Because of the way ocean currents flow, it's thought the bottle may have headed over towards Europe before floating back westwards towards the Bahamas . 'I forgot about the entire project,' Connor, told the New York Post. 'I imagined where it would be found, but I never imagined the Bahamas.' The bottle came ashore more than 1,000 nautical miles from where it drifted off in New York. It was found by Andrew and Carol Gracie, who live in the Bahamas. They were out walking on a private island when they came across the bottle. The couple say they are avid Beachcombers always looking for unusual treasure. 'At first I surmised it to have been thrown from a passing cruise ship recently,” Andrew Gracie told the 'Post. Sending out an SOS: The bottle was thrown into the Atlantic at Shelter Island, New York in May 2011 - it came ashore in the Bahamas almost three years later, 1,000 miles away . 'Halfway along the first crescent I immediately spotted a large clear bottle with notes inside,' said Mr Gracie.  'After reading the note, we emailed Connor and Jack Reardon detailing how and where we found the bottle. Needless to say, they were astounded to get our email.' The note read: 'My name is Connor. I live on Shelter Island. It is a small Island in between the two forks of Long Island, which extend out from New York City about 100 miles east. Our year-round population is about 2,500 people, but in  the summer we have a lot more tourists and summer people who only have summer homes out here . . I have a younger brother named Mitchell. He is 8. I also have a younger sister named Angelina. She is 5. My dog is a puggle named Boo. Write back.' Connor says he was shocked to receive a response. 'I wouldn’t have believed it,' he said. What makes the discovery all the more remarkable is that the bottle arrived in a location that ocean currents do not usually flow towards from where it was dropped. Currents from New York also tend to move in a northerly direction rather than south. It means throwing an item off the New York coastline make Canada, Greenland, Iceland or Europe a more likely point of arrival. Connor's teacher, Jack Reardon, says he has been assigning the project for nine years but has never had a bottle come from so far south. 'I didn't even believe it when these folks contacted me,' Mr Reardon said. 'I usually will get a response to the bottles within 24 hours from what I presume to be just pleasure boaters going by. The farthest response has been from Rhode Island, which isn't very far. I've never had a response come back from a legitimate far off distance. What a journey: The bottle ended up here in the Bahamas in what some believe could have been a 10,000 mile round trip . I think the bottle made a long, long clockwise journey and some westward moving storm blew it up on the beach where they found it.' Stormy weather could have contributed to the unusual currents, Mr. Reardon said. Connor speculated the bottle could have been drifting on that northern route when currents from Superstorms Sandy or Irene might have interceded with its trajectory. Mr Gracie also believes the bottle believes it may have taken a roundabout route to end up in the Bahamas. 'I can only surmise that there must have been a very strong outgoing tide to carry the bottle far enough out to reach the Gulf Stream' Mr. Gracie said. While no one will ever know the course the bottle took, he speculated that it might have traveled north past Nova Scotia, then easterly, just south of Iceland, then south past Scotland and Ireland and farther south towards the Canary . Islands where the currents could have carried it west toward the southern Bahamas. In the weeks since the bottle has been found, there there have been several emails between Connor and the Gracies. They told the Shelter Island Reporter they hope Connor’s experience with his message in a bottle will inspire other students. 'In today’s world of instant communication, emails, Short Message Service and Facebook, it’s great to hear that some of our teachers are still able to successfully stimulate our youth with some old-fashioned classroom experiments that will further stimulate them to seek answers to time-honored questions,' Mr. Gracie said. 'We will always need navigators, explorers, meteorologists, oceanographers and the like and it is this type of simple stimulation that our teachers can achieve with today’s youth,' he said.","Connor Corbett-Rice, 15, dropped bottle into the Atlantic ocean as part of a school assignment .

"By . Associated Press . An attorney for a teenager who pleaded guilty to killing three students in a high school cafeteria has asked an appeals court to toss out his sentence of life without parole because he was 17 at the time of the shooting. A prosecutor told the judges on Wednesday that Ohio law makes it clear that older teens charged with serious crimes should be tried in adult court. T.J. Lane's attorney is challenging a state law that allowed his case to be transferred from juvenile court to adult court, a statute also being contested in an unrelated case pending before the Ohio Supreme Court involving a 16-year-old sent to prison. Unrepentant: T.J. Lane, pictured at his original hearing in March 2013, was 17 when he shot and killed three students in an Ohio high school cafeteria and now his lawyers are arguing that he should have an appeal . Shocking: Lane made and obscene gesture to the families of the victims in court last year and wore a t-shirt that read 'KILLER' across his chest . The law requires the transfer to adult court if a suspect is 16 or 17 and accused of one of the most severe offenses, and there is probable cause to believe he or she committed the crime. Lane was waiting for a bus to his alternative school in February 2012 when he opened fire at Chardon High School, east of Cleveland. Three students died and three others were wounded. The original hearing took place inside a courtroom where a smirking Lane wore a T-shirt with 'killer' scrawled across it and gestured obscenely toward the victims' families during his sentencing. He wasn't present Wednesday. Lane, 19, could be brought back to the same courtroom if the courts decide he should be resentenced. It could take several months for the appeals court to decide. Because Lane was a juvenile, he is ineligible for the death penalty. Grieving community: The February 2012 shooting rampage at Chardon High School left three boys dead and three other students injured . Lane's attorney, Michael Partlow, argued that juvenile judges have more leeway with younger teens. 'What is the difference between a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old? He is still not an adult,' Partlow said. Geauga County Prosecutor James Flaiz countered that several rulings have upheld the state law allowing juveniles to be sent to adult court. He said the law is intended so that a 17-year-old can't shoot someone in the head and be set free when he turns 21. The Office of the Ohio Public Defender is aware of four people in Ohio, including Lane, serving life without parole for slayings that occurred when they were juveniles, assistant public defender Stephen Hardwick said. As of 2012, there were about 2,500 people in the U.S. serving life sentences for homicides that occurred when they were juveniles, but the current number is difficult to track because a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that year raised the possibility that hundreds of those sentences may be called into question, said Marsha Levick, chief counsel for the Philadelphia-based nonprofit Juvenile Law Center. Pure rage: Dina Parmertor, mother of victim Daniel, called Lane a monster and told him that he doesn't deserve to be called human . Tears of grief: Crystal King, sister of slain student Russell King Jr, addressed the court at Lane's sentencing . In mourning: Philip Carter, brother of Demetrius Hewlin, reads a statement on behalf of his mother . Giving juveniles life terms without parole 'means that we're making these decisions on Day One of sentencing about who Lane or any other juvenile will be 30, 40, 50 years from now,' Levick said. 'And it's almost impossible to make that decision or to know who he will become as an adult.' Lane's attorney also argued Wednesday that he should be resentenced after a recent Ohio Supreme Court decision overturned a life-without-parole sentence for Eric Long, who along with two adult defendants was convicted in two slayings in the Cincinnati area when Long was 17. The high court ruled that youth must be considered as a mitigating factor and the record must reflect that the court did so. The ruling said a trial court must reconsider Long's sentence, though it doesn't block him from being sentenced again to life without parole. Partlow argued that the judge who sentenced Lane never formally brought up his age. The prosecutor disagreed, saying age was not ignored during the process.","T.J.

"By . Grant Mccabe . He came to Britain as a ten-year-old schoolboy, escaping his war-torn Kosovan homeland to a promising future in a safe new home. But yesterday, 13 years after arriving, child refugee poster boy Arben Dumani was unmasked as the boss of a drugs gang behind a plot to flood the country that gave him refuge with £1.2m of cocaine. Unrepentant Dumani stood in the dock as prosecutors described a drug dealing enterprise involving him and with his three henchmen as on a ‘virtually industrial scale’. Jailed: Kosovan refugee Arben Dumani, 23, became the boss of a gang plotting to smuggle drugs into the UK - just 13 years after being granted refuge to live in the country . During a dawn raid on a safe house in Glasgow last year, officers seized over 2kg of the Class A drug and substances and equipment used to bulk out the pure drugs. The mob helped bring about their own downfall by taking mobile phone photos of themselves snorting cocaine laid out to spell their names. The four – all originally from Eastern Europe – were sentenced to a total of 30 years and six months at the High Court in Glasgow yesterday. Detective Chief Superintendent Athol Aitken said: ‘This serious organised crime group, led by Arben Dumani, was involved in the importation of cocaine with an estimated street value of £1.2million. ‘This was a significant quantity of drugs that would have caused untold harm to Scottish communities and I welcome the court result which will ensure the individuals involved are held accountable for their crimes.’ Dumani was just 10 when he and his relatives escaped the horrors of their Kosovan homeland for a new life in Glasgow. Gang members: Gjeorgj Pjetri, 30, from Kosovo, pictured left, and Albert Memia, 25, from Albania, pictured right, were also jailed . Caught red-handed: The gang helped bring about their own prosecutions by taking pictures of themselves snorting cocaine. Dumani's right-hand man Albert Memia, 25, can be seen in this image. He was jailed for 10 years at Glasgow High Court for supplying cocaine . In 1999, it was reported how he and six other child refugees started their first day at their new school in the city’s west end. Young Dumani - speaking through an interpreter - said at the time: ‘It was good - we played football and met a lot of new friends. ‘I drew pictures of houses and I am learning the days of the week in English. It was interesting and I was happy.’ Wealthy dealer Arben Dumani, came to Britain as a ten-year-old schoolboy, is pictured on a jetski . But yesterday, the 23-year-old was locked up for 12 years after he was convicted of being concerned in the supply of cocaine after a trial at the High Court in Glasgow. His right hand man Albert Memia, 25, was sentenced to 10 years after he pleaded guilty to the same charge. Couriers Fabion Ponari, 23, and Gjeorgj Pjetri, 28, were locked up for five years and three and a half years respectively. Judge . Michael O’Grady QC said to Dumani and Memia: ‘This operation that you . two were an integral part of was exceptional in its planning, . sophistication and scope. ‘You . were responsible for physically setting up a drug processing plant and . responsible for processing and intending to distribute class A drugs.’ Hidden stash: These packages of cocaine were just two of many that the gang planned to distribute in the UK . Evidence: Officers found this cocaine pellet mould during a dawn raid on the gang's safe house in Glasgow . Sophisticated operation: Glasgow High Court heard the gang had set up a drug processing plant and were intending to distribute class A drugs . A hydraulic press, used to press cocaine into blocks, was also found in the bathroom of the gang's safe house . Packaged up: Cocaine pellets, each weighing seven grams, were uncovered at the safe house .","Arben Dumani was 10 when he escaped worn-torn Kosovo with his family .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Tim Line has been sentenced to four weeks behind bars, suspended for two years, after he created a website harassing a solicitor . A campaigner from a Fathers 4 Justice splinter group who created a website harassing a solicitor has narrowly avoided jail. Activist Tim Line, 50, started the website after blaming Adrian Bressington for a lengthy four-year divorce battle where he lost custody of his children. He claimed the solicitor deliberately 'delayed' proceedings and on one occasion alleged he neglected to pass messages on to his ex-wife regarding visiting their children. The father-of-three, of Trowbridge, Wiltshire, set up a website to write of his experiences and encouraged others to do the same, comparing the site to TripAdvisor. He said: 'The website is critical yes, but nothing wrong. There are plenty of websites out there that are critical, it’s just like TripAdvisor. 'I mean TripAdvisor tells the world about crummy service or hotels and it is perfectly allowable.' Line, who is a member of Real Fathers for Justice - a splinter faction of Fathers 4 Justice -  was sentenced to four weeks behind bars, suspended for two years, after he was found guilty of harassment after a judge dubbed the case a 'deliberate and continued course of conduct'. He was also handed a restraining order and told to pay £480 in costs. Sentencing him Deputy District Judge Champion told him: 'This was a deliberate and continued course of conduct and it was pointed out to you that it was harassment. Line (left) claimed Mr Bressington (right) deliberately 'delayed' proceedings and on one occasion alleged he neglected to pass messages on to his ex-wife regarding visiting their children . 'It crosses the custody threshold because he showed sheer unwillingness and ignored the CPS and the police when they warned him. 'The nature of the harassment, the person you have harassed, the way you have done it and the fact you have been given every opportunity to stop it before you appeared in court all adds up. 'I frankly don’t believe what you said about collecting other people to find information.' North Avon Magistrates Court heard that Line began to target Mr Bressington after his wife went to him asking for help to divorce her partner she alleged was involved in a campaign of domestic abuse. The court heard Line (pictured) began to target Mr Bressington after his wife went to him asking for help to divorce her partner . The court was told Line contested many . parts of the divorce - something he avidly denies - including . arrangements with his children. When specialist officers were brought . in to speak to his three daughters, however, they all decided they did not . want to see Line any more, an outcome he blamed the solicitor for. Line . created the website after becoming involved in a similar site, . Solicitors From Hell, which was shut down in March 2012 following a . number of successful libel cases against its owner Rick Kordowski. But despite repeated warnings from police his website could be regarded as harassment, Line continued to maintain and post onto the site. Speaking after the case Mr Bressington said: 'He is just acting as if he has done nothing wrong. 'I just think he has brought the whole thing on himself and it is very regretful that he has done that. 'His ex-wife came to me alleging domestic abuse, what was I supposed to do, you have to take these cases seriously and I did.' Line was also handed a restraining order demanding he remove the website and could not post anything on the internet about Mr Bressington 'which would amount to harassment or encourage or facilitate anyone else to do so'.","Tim Line started website after blaming solicitor for four-year divorce .

"By . Wills Robinson . Authorities missed eight chances to act before a teenager obsessed with knives brutally stabbed his mother 94 times, an inquiry has found. Kieren Smith, then aged 16, killed mother-of-three Leah Whittle, 42, at a flat in Weymouth, Dorset in July 2012. The teenager was sentenced to 15 years' detention after being found guilty of her murder. Following Miss Whittle's horrifying death, an inquiry found that numerous agencies had chances to intervene in the pair's fragile relationship. The findings by the Dorset Community Safety Partnership suggested that doctors, police, social services, mental health services, and even teachers should have stepped in when different problems, including violence and neglect, were flagged up. Missed opportunities: Leah Whittle, 44, was stabbed to death by her son Kieren Smith in Weymouth, Dorset, in 2012 . Officials suggested that there were 'lost opportunities' in the lead up to Miss Whittle's death and it was vital to 'learn lessons'. Records by various agencies also showed that since the age of 11, Smith had been aggressive towards his mother nine times. During the 2012 trial, Winchester . Crown Court heard that Smith had spent two years alone in his room, . watching horror DVDs, after he had been expelled from school. The . jury heard that Smith attacked his mother in the flat they shared . before he lied to police, saying she had been killed by drug-dealers. The report revealed that Smith should have been referred for psychological testing, been monitored more closely a school, and had his past experiences of domestic violence examined more closely. It added that from the age of 13 until the murder, Smith had been arrested a number of times, told NHS staff at a walk-in centre he was having 'regular sex' with a partner and would drink vodka and cider. At home, he was said to have been damaging property and was abusive to his mother, although not violent. The eight-day trial at Winchester Crown Court in 2012 heard attacked his mother in the flat they shared before he lied to police, saying she had been killed by drug-dealers . The publication concluded: 'This is an extremely tragic case for all concerned and it is important that all possible steps are taken to learn lessons and improve practice in the future. 'The overarching conclusion must be that it would have been impossible to predict accurately that A (Miss Whittle) was at risk of being murdered by B (Smith), and that practitioners generally acted in good faith within their current knowledge base and work environment. 'However, there were lost opportunities to act differently and lessons that can be learnt which should improve the response to similar situations in the future. 'In the case of B there is little indication that his early childhood experiences were explored in sufficient depth in order for his current behaviour to have been interpreted in the light of this understanding. 'Had this been done there may have . been more of a focus on his mental health and the need to move beyond . short term approaches towards sustained change over time. 'Psychological . testing after his arrest revealed that B has an IQ of 69-79, placing . him within the category of borderline learning disability. 'The . lack of referral for psychological testing at school meant that there . was insufficient attention paid to meeting his specific learning needs. ...Although there were many agencies and . services working with both the mother and son, it appears that there was . not one particular service or agency that looked at the whole picture . Cliff Turner, chairman of Dorset’s Safeguarding Children Board . 'The focus appears to have been mainly on his behavioural problems rather than exploring ways in which he could be appropriately supported to achieve at school. 'The result appears to be increasing frustration on the part of B, who ultimately opted out of education. 'The School Nursing Service could have potentially played a more proactive role in services to the family and there is little indication that they were actively engaged with the plans for work with B. 'This may have been more likely had the school nurse read B’s records prior to contact with him, since his current alcohol issue would have been understood within a broader context, including B’s angry and abusive behaviour towards his mother. Since the review began, agencies across the county including Dorset Police, local healthcare organisations and Dorset County Council have all made changes to their services to try and minimise the chance of such a tragic case happening again. Councillor Ray Nottage, chairman of the Dorset Community Safety Partnership, said: 'This was a very tragic case and I’d like to express our condolences to the family. 'The review, which examines the circumstances of this case and agencies’ involvement with the family, allows us to look at how organisations work with families and highlight where lessons can be learned - in particular, improving agency knowledge of, and response to, parental abuse. 'We want to create safer communities, so it is vital that victims of domestic violence, their friends, family and the wider community report abuse to the police or some other local agency.' Findings: The report published by Dorset Council's Community Safety Partnership suggested eight steps should have been taken which could have helped prevent Miss Whittle's death . Cliff Turner, chairman of Dorset’s Safeguarding Children Board, said: 'Although there were many agencies and services working with both the mother and son, it appears that there was not one particular service or agency that looked at the whole picture. 'Since this devastating case, agencies have been working very hard to address the areas highlighted in the review and change the way they operate to make sure the right information is shared with the right people, at the right time, to reduce the risk of a similar case happening again.' Dorset County Council has already made changes to its social care assessments and has trained staff to deal with more complex family situations. The council has also made sure that young people who are not going to school regularly, and who are not being seen by a professional, are subject to a multi-agency planning meeting to assess their whole situation. Councillor Rebecca Knox, the cabinet member for children’s safeguarding and families, said: 'This was a terrible case that was extremely distressing for the family involved. 'Although such cases are very rare, it has made us review how we support families, particularly with teenagers, find new ways to work with those that are harder to reach and improve the way we respond to the more complex cases. 'We are committed to supporting children, young people and their families across Dorset, and are doing everything in our power to minimise the chance of such a tragic case happening again.'","Leah Whittle, 42, was killed by her son Kieren Smith in Weymouth, Dorset .

"By . Associated Press . A killer at the age of 12, the now 23-year-old Evan Savoie has been sentenced in Ephrata, Washington to 20 years in prison. Savoie pleaded guilty in November to second-degree murder in the 2003 slaying of 13-year-old Craig Sorger in Oasis Park in Ephrata. He was sentenced Tuesday. A jury initially found Savoie guilty of first-degree murder and he was sentenced to 26 years in prison. That conviction was overturned on appeal. Tried as an adult: Evan Savoie, pictured in 2006, was convicted of first-degree murder for a second time and sentenced to 20 years in jail . Beaten and stabbed 34 times: Craig Sorger's murder stunned the town of Ephrata in Washington state . Another 12-year-old who took part in the killing, Jake Eakin, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 2005 and was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Savoi and Eakin were playing in Oasis Park and invited Sorger to play. He was beaten with a rock and stabbed to death. Hhis mother reported him missing when he didn't return home. Police found his body in a mix of brush and leaves. A medical examiner determined he had been beaten and stabbed 34 times. Police said there were discrepancies in the playmates' stories and blood on their clothing. They . proclaimed their innocence for two years, even appearing on national . television, but Eakin ultimately led police to the murder weapon - a . knife that matched the missing tip - and agreed to testify against . Savoie in a plea deal. Prosecutors . tried Savoie as an adult, one of the youngest such defendants in state . history, and a jury convicted him of first-degree murder. The . case ultimately cost the county and the state, which pitched in to help . pay for the high-profile trial, more than $1 million. Evidence: Jake Eakin testifies at the original trial in April 2006 that Savoie was the killer . Through it all, the three boys' families ran into each other at the gas station and in grocery stores, and residents picked sides of the arguments. Defense attorneys alleged family members might have killed Sorger, a special education student who struggled socially, sparking outrage from his parents. Prosecutors doggedly pursued the case for three years amid national media attention and fighting between three families, until a jury convicted one boy and a judge sentenced him to 26 years.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . The best man of a triple amputee soldier was today jailed after he stole thousands of pounds from the Afghanistan veteran just before his wedding day. Conor Aldous, 22, stole £2,500 from Private Alex Stringer just weeks before he married his childhood sweetheart Danielle. Private Stringer, 23, from Canvey Island, Essex, lost both his legs and his left arm after stepping on a Taliban improvised explosive device (IED) whilst serving in Afghanistan in January 2011. Conor Aldous , 22, left, stole £2,500 from triple-amputee Private Alex Stringer, right, just weeks before helping him walk down the aisle on artificial legs (pictured) Alex Stringer with his wife Danielle. Hero Pte Stringer lost both his legs and his arm when he stepped on an IED in Afghanistan in 2011 . When the soldier returned home after his traumatic ordeal, Aldous offered to act as his carer - moving in to his home and sleeping in the living room. He was trusted with access to bank . accounts and PIN codes to help his school friend during his . recovery. Aldous abused this trust - stealing the money from his friend's account. Today Aldous, . from Grays, Essex, was jailed for 10 months at Badilson Crown Court after admitting one count of . theft at an earlier hearing at Southend Magistrates’ court. A confiscation order for £2,500 was also made. Judge David Owen-Jones, sentencing, said: 'It was a mean offence. He was extremely vulnerable and you abused that trust. Conor Aldous stands with Danielle on her wedding day. The man moved in to the couple's home to care for school friend Pte Stringer - and was trusted with the pair's bank details and PIN codes . Pts Stringer while he was serving in Afghanistan just shortly before he was injured in the explosion. Aldous abused the couple's trust to steal money directly from their accounts . 'It is a very serious offence and only an immediate custodial sentence can be justified.' Aldous, . who was accompanied to court by his pregnant girlfriend, showed no . reaction as the sentence was passed. His partner broke down in tears as . Aldous was led to the cells by a security guard. The . court heard today how Aldous was staying at the soldier's home in . Canvey Island, Essex, but was secretly stealing their money. The . thefts were only discovered when a routine call from the bank revealed a . £40 transaction had in fact been £100, raising suspicions. Aldous gives his best man speech at the wedding. He admitted one count of theft at an earlier hearing and was jailed for 10 months today . The couple, who have three young children, then reviewed their bank statements in horror only to find a number of unauthorised transactions by Aldous. Charlotte Davison, prosecuting, said the couple initially believed Aldous’ excuses. But in July 2012 a credit card statement showed more money had been withdrawn in the form of cash from the accounts. She said: 'They confronted him and he admitted he had been skimming additional funds from their credit card account.' The generous couple agreed to a contract which would see Aldous pay the stolen money back but not a penny was returned and they eventually called the police in to investigate. Aldous made full admissions to the theft when he was interviewed. He was given a more lenient sentence because of his confession. Matthew Bone, mitigating, said: 'This was very unpleasant abuse. 'The victim in this case was disabled serving his country. This man was his friend, this man breached the trust of his friend and he has to live with what he has done in this case. 'It is very difficult to understand why it is that this offence was committed, especially within the context of the generosity that Mr and Mrs Stringer showed this defendant. 'Whatever the sentence, Mr Aldous will have to live with the fact that he is a man who committed this very mean offence and he has to live with the consequences of his actions.' The court heard Aldous had committed previous, similar, offences of theft and fraud against both friends and former employers. Speaking outside court today, the soldier (pictured at home) said: 'It's absolutely disgusting as this money was supposed to be our children's futures' Mr Bone said Aldous was an 'immature' and 'young' 22-year-old. After the sentencing Mr Stringer and his wife, 22, said they were pleased to see Aldous jailed for his actions. Mr Stringer said: 'What is done is done - I don’t really have anything to say about the sentence.' But the couple, who were at court, spoke of the devastating effect the theft has had on Alex, 23, and their young family Millie, five, Harlie, three, and one-year-old Jessica. Private Alex Stringer stepped on a Taliban Improvised Explosive Device in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in January 2011.Pte Stringer, of the 23 ­Pioneer Regiment Royal Logistics Corps, needed more than 30 ­operations after losing both legs, shattering his ­pelvis and ­suffering such ­severe injuries to his left arm that it had to be amputated at the elbow. For many months after the blast, he spent three weeks every two months at the Army’s rehabilitation ­centre in Headley Court, Surrey. The soldier previously gained media attention when he and his then fiancee Danielle were moved to a flat on the sixth floor of a block in Chadwell St Mary, Essex. He married Danielle in July 2012. Mr Stringer said: 'We gave him [Conor] absolutely everything he needed. I’ve known him since school - for about eight years. He even helped me walk down the aisle on my stumps on my wedding day. But he twisted that friendship to play me and Danielle off against each other. He convinced me we were overspending on our wedding to cover up the thefts. 'When we found out I gave him the chance to admit it to my face but instead he chose to confess through a message on Facebook. The guy is a coward. 'The worst thing is having to explain to a four-year-old that the person she looked up to won’t be coming back. It is our children’s money and future that he has stolen.' Mrs Stringer added: 'It seems silly to say it now but we just trusted him. We were so busy with moving into a new house and the wedding we gave him control over everything. 'He was always offering to help and we were just pleased to have another set of hands around the house. We invited him into our home and gave him a roof over his head and this is how he has repaid us. 'It’s absolutely disgusting as this money was supposed to be our children’s futures. When I told Millie that was never coming back she broke down crying and I had to with her to stop her sobbing - it was heart-breaking.'","Pte Alex Stringer, 23, lost both legs and left arm in Afghanistan explosion .

It is estimated that British trade and investment was given a Â£9.9 billion boost following the Games and it is also thought that an additional 17, 900 jobs per year would be created in London between 2012 and 2015 thanks to the Olympics. Scroll down for video . The first pictures of how a second runway at Gatwick Airport have been unveiled. If it gets the go-ahead it is claimed it could bring a massive economic boost to south London . Leading architect Sir Terry Farrell believes an expansion to Gatwick Airport would provide an Olympic style boost to the local economy, similar to the one in East London after holding the games in 2012 . And Sir Terry believes a Gatwick expansion would see an Olympic style regeneration for the south-east of England stretching from Croydon to Brighton. He said: 'I have no doubt that with a second runway, Gatwick will deliver more balanced, and more widely spread, economic growth for London and the South East. 'Expansion at Gatwick could do for South London and the wider region what the Olympics did for East London and give a huge boost in terms of jobs, housing and regeneration.' The new pictures of the proposed runway were part of the launch of the 'Gatwick Obviously' campaign, which claims a second runway at Gatwick could provide more connections to more destinations than a third runway at Heathrow. The new pictures were part of the launch of the 'Gatwick Obviously' campaign, which say an expansion would provide better balanced growth for London . Heathrow is the UK's only hub airport and though it does not oppose a second runway at Gatwick or the extending of smaller airports around the UK, it argues that freight is a vital component of the economy and and this is part of the essential role played by Heathrow. The campaign also say that a second runway is needed at the airport to cater for short-haul flights to Europe and that a Gatwick expansion would provide better balanced growth for London and the South East, in particular for south London, including Croydon and down to Brighton and the south coast. Gatwick Airport presented its findings to political and business leaders at the Shard in London. The Olympic Stadium, pictured left during the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics is one of the symbols of economic recovery in East London. The area has undergone regeneration thanks to hosting the Games . Gatwick chief operating officer Stewart Wingate said: 'The next runway needs to bring the greatest economic return for the UK at the lowest environmental cost. 'That makes Gatwick the obvious answer as we will be able to connect to more destinations in the future because we are the only airport to cater for all airline models. 'It is the best solution that embraces long term aviation trends. It can also be delivered in less time with less cost and less noise.'","Pictures of the proposed second runway at Gatwick are unveiled .

"By . Richard Spillett . Council leader John Burden is among the delegation going on a publicly-funded 'fact-finding' mission to US theme parks . A council has been slammed over plans to send nine of its bosses on a £15,500 'fact-finding' trip to a string of Florida theme parks - at taxpayers’ expense. The team from Gravesham District Council in Kent will visit Disney World, Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure in Orlando over four days at Easter. The trip is being organised by . developers London Resort Company Holdings (LRCH) as the council prepares . for the arrival of the £2billion Paramount theme park in Swanscombe, Kent in 2018. The officials going on the trip . include council leader John Burden, planning boss Cllr Jane Cribbon and . communities boss Cllr Andrea Webb. Tory . opposition Cllr John Cubitt and shadow planning boss Cllr Robin . Theobald are also packing their bags, along with four senior council . officers. Organisers . said the delegation will benefit from seeing similar-scaled projects . and hearing about the development and running of a 'global attraction'. But . critics question why the group cannot get the same benefits from . visiting a theme park closer to hand - such as Disneyland Paris. Communities boss Andrea Webb (left) and planning chief Jane Cribbon (right) are joining council leaders  on a the trip to three US theme parks . As well as visiting Disney World in Florida (pictured), the group from Gravesham council will be taking in Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure in Orlando . Cllr . Jeremy Kite, leader of neighbouring Dartford District Council, said: 'I . must say, I think it’s an unusual thing for them to be doing. I can’t . see the benefit with it at this time. 'I haven’t been invited and I wouldn’t go if we had been. If you’re going to do this sort of research, I think there’s places closer to home. 'You’ve got Euro Disney across the Channel and other places in Europe which are easier to get to. It seems like an interesting use of taxpayers’ money and not one I’m going to follow.' But Cllr Burden, who is going on the trip, said: 'The programme for this visit is extremely busy being packed with serious business discussions which should provide invaluable insights into the issues surrounding the development of a truly global attraction on our doorstep. The visit comes ahead of the planned £2billion Paramount theme park on the Swanscombe Peninsula in Kent . Critics say the council could have saved the taxpayer thousands by visiting Disneyland Paris . 'It is entirely right the council examines all these issues fully and we are grateful to LRCH for facilitating these meetings with key people and communities which have had direct experience of facing and overcoming those challenges. 'This is the biggest development project in Europe and has global significance. The impact it will have is life-changing for everyone in the area and possibly far beyond. 'We have to get this right and prepare to be in a position to inform the discussions yet to come.' It is hoped LRCH will reimburse the authority the cost of the trip during the planning process. A council spokeswoman said: 'The council expects the cost of the visit (£15,441 approximately) will be met from the costs to process the planning application with this trip enabling the team to focus on the project specific questions that will need to be resolved by the applicant in due course for a scheme that is outside the normal planning parameters for any council.' The new £2billion Paramount theme park is being planned as a rival to Disneyland Paris. It will create up to 27,000 jobs and transform an 872-acre brownfield site in the Swanscombe Peninsula in Kent. Developers plan to build a huge £2billion Hollywood-inspired resort in Kent. Film giant Paramount Pictures has given permission for its name to be used for the proposed development on the Swanscombe Peninsula. Developers hope the project – which would be built on the site of a former cement works near Dartford - will open in 2018. It would be located near Ebbsfleet International station, which is on the Eurostar route between London and Paris. The 872-acre site - nearly twice the size of the Olympic Park in Stratford - will feature Europe’s largest indoor water park, rollercoasters, cinemas, theatres, hotels and live music venues. The site's developer, London Resort Company Holdings, estimates that the project would create up to 27,000 jobs in the area. Announcing the plans in 2012, project leader Tony Sefton said: ‘Our vision is to create a world class entertainment destination, the first of its kind in the UK.' Paramount Pictures films include the Madagascar franchise (pictured). A similar entertainment resort is due to open Spain in 2012, which will feature a Titanic Experience and rides based on Mission Impossible, Star Trek and War of the Worlds.","Council staff heading to  Disney World and Universal Studios in Florida .

"By . Joshua Gardner . A man who spent his vacation giving away $50 and $100 to dozens of need Canadians last week has been tossed into a mental institution. After certain recipients of Richard Wright's rare generosity decided the Prince Edward Island man could be mentally ill, they called authorities Thursday and Wright was hauled away for evaluation. Now his daughter has started an online campaign to get her father out of the institution and claims he's perfectly sane and just wanted to share 'some extra money.' Unfair? Prince Edward Island man Richard Wright was tossed into a psych ward on Thursday not long after dozens of reports emerged that he was giving away hundreds of dollars to dozens of strangers last week . Wants her dad back: Wright's daughter has taken to Facebook to raise awareness of her dad's detainment, which she says is unfair and unnecessary . 'He did nothing illegal, he was simply helping some people out. Since when did being a nice person make you end up in the hospital,' wrote Chelsey Wright on the Facebook page she created, #OpFreeRichardWright.' Richard's troubles began while he was vacationing with family in Halifax. Dozens of people started taking to social media to report a mystery man who gave them $50, $100 and in some cases valuable silver bullion coins simply because he wanted to help them out. Chelsey told Metro News that he saved up for a long time for his charity spree. But that didn't seem to matter after reports came that the modern day Robin Hood spreading the wealth around town may have been mentally ill. 'They think he is sick and has mental . issues,' Chelsey wrote on Sunday. 'I know he does not. He plans to . hopefully attain legal help tomorrow. 'We . are keeping our fingers crossed. My dad is honestly a great guy. He has . always been good to people, and he simply just wanted to help people . out.' Since she created #OpFreeRichardWright, over 3,000 people have joined the group and more are joining all the time. Among his supporters are the people Wright helped along the way, including . Jennifer . Corbett, who received $150 and a promise that 'things will get better' from Wright. She even called him at the psych ward in Charlottetown to . wish him well. 'I don’t . think it’s fair that this happened,' Corbett told Metro. 'I mean do you . think that people are going to want to do good after this?' Authorities won't comment on Wright's case for privacy reasons, but health officials said in a release: . 'A patient is always admitted at the clinical recommendation of a physician who has met with and assessed the patient.' Among the grateful recipients of Wright's kindness were Bill McNamara and June Bond, who received two $50 bills and two valuable silver bullion coins (held by Abigail, 3). Recipients like them have become strong supporters of Wright's .","Richard Wright was detained Thursday after he decided to share 'some extra money' with those in need while on vacation in Halifax .

"By . Daily Mail Repoter . and Ap . An Oregon man who beat his father and his father's girlfriend to death nearly two years ago was spared the death penalty but will spend the rest of his life in prison with no chance of parole, a judge ruled Tuesday. Johan Gillette, 38, received two consecutive life sentences following emotional testimony from victims' relatives in Lane County Circuit Court. Gillette could have faced the death penalty. But his own family and that of the other victim opposed execution, and Gillette's brother told his older sibling to sign a sentencing agreement that took the death penalty off the table in exchange for waiving some appeal rights. Life: Johan Gillette maintains his innocence has he's sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole . Victims: Gillette was found guilty of murdering his father, James Gillette (left) and his father's girlfriend, Anne McLucas . A jury last week convicted Gillette of murdering his father James Gillette, 73, and the father's girlfriend, Anne McLucas, 71, at a home south of Eugene in September 2012. Both died of multiple crushing blows to the head, delivered by what is believed to have been some kind of wrench. The murder weapon was never found. Gillette maintained his innocence on Tuesday, telling the court that 'this is not a murder case' and he believes he'll get a new trial. 'The only tragedy in my opinion is Anne McLucas,' he said. 'I did this agreement for others, not myself.' Self defense: Gillette claims that his father pulled a gun on him, which started the fight that left the two victims dead . He did not make eye contact with McLucas' relatives who addressed the court, KVAL-TV reported. 'Johan, you murdered my mother, beat her, left her on the floor to die,' said Jacob Shapiro, McLucas' son. 'She was just caught up in a father-son argument.' Gillette claimed he acted in self-defense when his father reached for a gun during an argument. During the trial, he took the stand to describe the fight. Prosecutors said the younger Gillette flew into a rage over his father's plan to evict Gillette and his girlfriend from a trailer on the father's property. Spared: The families of both victims argued against the death penalty for Gillette . Prosecutors focused on evidence that the victims continued to be beaten once they were on the ground. James Gillette and McLucas were found in the bedroom of the main house. James Gillette already was dead when a man who worked for him discovered the crime scene. McLucas still clung to life but died the next day in a hospital.","Johan Gillette, 38, was convicted last week of murdering his father, James Gillette, and his father's girlfriend, Anne McLucas .

"By . Amanda Williams . Gemma Sheridan, who unwittingly became the centre of an internet sensation after her name was used in a story about a castaway on a desert island . A woman who supposedly survived on a desert island by drinking rainwater from coconut shells and killing a goat with a clam shell for food, has revealed that the whole story was a hoax. Gemma Sheridan's story of rescue went viral when her image was posted online and shared and retweeted hundreds of thousands of times. The accompanying story claimed that she and two friends set sail from Merseyside to Hawaii in 2007 but hit a freak storm in which her friends were blown overboard and died. But the tale was merely a prank, played upon the 26-year-old by her friends, mocking her comparatively simple lifestyle to the internet fantasy they had concocted for her. According to the story, posted on news-hound.org, Miss Sheridan, from Widnes, Cheshire, was eventually rescued when she made a giant SOS sign on the beach and it was spotted by 'a kid from Minnesota on Google Earth'. The article has since been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter. 'The people behind the website are just good friends with a strange sense of humour and busy brain,' she said. 'They posted the story then messaged me saying they were going to make me famous. I thought the story was a good one and it made me laugh.' Referring to the goat-killing story, she said: 'I can't kill a spider never mind smash a goat's head in.' She added: 'I thought it would get a few likes but didn't expect this. 'A surprising amount of people thought it was real. I feel bad disappointing them but it's just a laugh.' The story claimed Miss Sheridan, from Widnes, had been marooned on a desert island near Hawaii for seven years and that her SOS sign was spotted on Google Earth by a 'kid in Minnesota' Miss Sheridan, a saleswoman, said her real life with her boyfriend and dog was far from her internet castaway adventure. 'My . friend at news-hound had been skitting me about how happy I was with my . simple lifestyle, which is probably another reason behind them writing . such a ridiculous story about me. The . original story - 'Google Earth Finds Woman Trapped on Deserted Island' - . claims Miss S makeshift SOS message was finally found thanks to Google . Earth. But the tale was merely a prank played upon the 26-year-old by her friends (who also superimposed this picture of her onto the body of a castaway), mocking her comparatively simple lifestyle to the internet fantasy life they had concocted for her . In reality, the image is from a 2010 Amnesty International report on violence in Kyrgyzstan - the uncropped picture shows buildings in the background. Adding to the hoax, the details of her survival are not only fake but plagiarised - with huge chunks lifted from the survival experience of actual explorer Ed Stafford. For the record, Miss Sheridan has no sailing experience and no imminent plans to recreate her fictional adventure.","Gemma Sheridan's image unwittingly posted online along with survival tale .

"By . Tim Shipman . A Tory  MP spoke of  his ‘nightmare’ last night after he was forced to wait more than a year  to clear his name over fraud allegations. The Crown Prosecution Service said yesterday that Peter Bone and his wife Jennie would not face charges over the funding of residential care for his mother-in-law. But the MP said it was absurd that the police had spent more than a year probing claims that were without foundation, and warned that innocent people across the country have been let down by the police. Peter Bone, MP for Wellingborough, with his wife Jennie said their 'nightmare' had come to an end after being told they will not face criminal charges . Mr . Bone, 61, also claimed that the strain of the events contributed to his . wife being diagnosed with breast cancer last week, arguing that the . couple’s ordeal had condemned her to anxiety and sleepless nights. Their . constituency home was raided by police in March last year and they . were  interviewed under caution a month later amid claims that they had . misused funds from the sale of a house belonging to Mrs Bone’s mother, Dorothy Sweeney. The police . passed a file to the CPS in November but they only decided to drop the . case yesterday. Mr Bone, MP for Wellingborough in Northamptonshire, told . the Daily Mail: ‘This nightmare has lasted more than a year from the . time when the police raided our house. It is just absurd that justice . takes this long. ‘The trauma . my family has been through is unbelievable. Our reputations were under a . cloud for a year – and I am an MP. The shocking thing is that any . innocent person in Britain can have this happen to them at any time.’ He . added: ‘My wife was diagnosed with breast cancer last week. We would . argue this ordeal contributed to it. If this had all been dealt with in a . few months she would not have gone through all the sleepless nights and . worry.’ Mrs Bone is locked . in a dispute over care home fees with Northamptonshire County Council . which is still the subject of a civil case. Mr Bone said he and his family ave suffered trial by media . It . has been reported that the Bones were under investigation for . misleading the council about the sale of Mrs Sweeney’s home. But Malcolm . McHaffie, deputy head of the CPS special crime division, said: ‘Having . carefully considered all of the available evidence, we have decided . there is insufficient evidence to charge any criminal offence.’ Exonerating . the Bones, he said: ‘The evidence showed: firstly that the woman’s . mother considered the suspects’ conduct to be acceptable; secondly that . the suspects acted openly in declaring the sale of the mother’s house to . the council; thirdly that no element of dishonesty could be proved. Therefore we have advised the police to take no further action.’ Mr . Bone said: ‘There were unfounded allegations made by the county council . which took the police an extremely long time to investigate when they . were without any foundation, which the CPS has made clear in its . remarks. ‘We were . interviewed only once by the police. We were never arrested. We were . never charged with any offence whatsoever and yet this has been hanging . over us for an entire year.’ Mr and Mrs Bone have already filed official complaints with the police and the local council over their conduct. The . MP said: ‘We were lied to throughout the process by the police about . what was going on. People ought to be entitled to know what is happening . and they ought to be entitled to swift justice.’ He . said he will now raise the difficulty some people have in getting . speedy justice with the Government’s top law officer, Dominic Grieve. ‘This . is something I will talk to the Attorney General and the Home Secretary . about,’ Mr Bone said. ‘It is not acceptable for anybody to be treated . like this. We have been contacted by many people who find themselves in a . similar position to us.’ He added: ‘We are naturally delighted that this nightmare has now come to an end.’","Eurosceptic MP Peter Bone's house was raided by police last year .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Conman Gary Sheehy (pictured) deceived Lee Mackie into investing £4,350 of the money she received after her son Jason was blown up by an improvised explosive device in a camping equipment business . This is the conman who tricked a Royal Marine's mother out of the life insurance payout she receieved when her son was killed in Afghanistan by persuading her to invest in his failing business. Gary Sheehy deceived Lee Mackie into investing £4,350 of the money she received after her son Jason was blown up by an improvised explosive device in a camping equipment business, promising her she would double her money within two years. Although the enterprise did exist, . Sheehy, 50, lied to her about its success, claiming thousands of orders . were in the pipeline when in fact it was failing. After months of evading calls and excuses, Ms Mackie, 58, reported Sheehy, her neighbour’s boyfriend, to the police. However, Sheehy was spared an immediate prison term today and was handed a nine-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. He was ordered to pay back £2,000 of the money after he admitted the fraud at an earlier hearing. Oxford Crown Court was told that Ms Mackie had received around £60,000 in life insurance after 21-year-old Jason, who served with 3rd Armoured Support Group, was killed in 2009. Sheehy befriended her as his partner was Ms Mackie’s next-door neighbour in Bampton, Oxfordshire. Patrick Moran, prosecuting,told the court: 'He went on to abuse that friendship and the trust . placed in him by Ms Mackie and he did so at a time when she was . vulnerable.' In June . 2010 Ms Mackie gave £10,000 to Sheehy to set up a motor vehicle . sales business. The business failed but there were no criminal charges . brought against Sheehy for the money given to him. In October that year he asked her for another £3,500 for the camping equipment firm. He told Ms Mackie the equipment was already in production and that 140,000 units had been ordered. 'In fact the device was never in production and no orders had been placed for it,' said Mr Moran. A few months later Sheehy asked her for another £850. Victim: Lee Mackie, pictured with a portrait of her son Jason, had received around £60,000 in life insurance after the 21-year-old was killed in Afghanistan . Fallen hero: 21-year-old Jason Mackie, who served with the 3rd Armoured Support Group, was killed in 2009 . Ms . Mackie thought this was another investment, however, it was needed to repay one of Sheehy's customers in York who he had sold faulty equipment to. Mr Moran said it was clear Sheehy was willing to 'behave recklessly' with other people’s money. Peter De Feu, mitigating, said Sheehy had not intended to defraud Ms Mackie. In memory: Marine Mackie's campaign medals . 'It is a business that, if it had worked, would have made her a lot of money,' he said. 'It may be that the defendant wasn’t entirely open with Ms Mackie as to how badly it failed. 'He was desperately trying to keep what he thought was a brilliant idea on the road and so misled her.' The . court heard that Sheehy lives with two women in separate houses, one of . whom he has two children with, one aged three and the other eight months, and that he provides for them both financially. Mr . De Feu said Sheehy had set up a new car trading business and was . 'absolutely determined' to pay back every penny Ms Mackie had given him, including the £10,000 from the vehicle business. 'With . the plates that he’s spinning, the efforts that he’s making to keep . those households going, any loss of liberty would have devastating . effects,' Mr De Feu told the court. Wearing . a grey suit, pink shirt and purple tie, Sheehy, who has diabetes, . appeared emotionless as the details of the case were read out. Sentencing Sheehy, Judge Ian Pringle said: 'You can imagine . the effect that has had on her. 'She feels betrayed by your actions.' However, . the judge said he was satisfied the act was 'totally out of character' for Sheehy, adding: 'I’m prepared therefore to be more lenient than I . otherwise would have been.' After . handing him a suspended sentence, Judge Pringle said: 'Be under no . illusion, if you do get into trouble that sentence of nine months is . likely to be implemented in full.' No place to hide: Sheehy, pictured attempting to hide his face with a bag, was told that Ms Mackie felt 'betrayed' by his actions . Spared jail: Sheehy was given a nine-month prison sentence, suspended for two years after admitting fraud . Following the hearing, Ms Mackie said she was 'not surprised' that Sheehy had escaped an immediate prison sentence. 'I still struggle to put it into words - it was the most devastating thing that has ever happened in my life. People say time makes it better but it doesn’t,' she said of her son's death. 'Of course I think he should have gone to prison but I didn’t think it was going to happen. 'To have got him put inside would have been the cherry on top of the cake.' Ms Mackie said she was 'seriously chuffed' that Sheehy will have to do 120 hours of unpaid work but was doubtful that he would fulfil his pledge to repay both the £4,350 she gave him for the camping business, and the other £10,000. Vulnerable: Ms Mackie said she felt guilt that she had 'blown' the money which had cost her son his life . 'He’s not a con artist for nothing,' said Ms Mackie. 'He can talk himself out of anything.' Of the fraud, Ms Mackie said: 'I was furious, because of where the money had come from. 'I had this huge guilt that I had blown this money which cost my child his life,” she said. 'I suddenly got this huge anxiety and guilt about using the money and being taken for a ride. 'I was so scared I couldn’t even tell my other two sons. I am not a stupid person but because I was so vulnerable I allowed this man to con me into giving it to him.'","Gary Sheehy persuaded Lee Mackie to invest £4,350 in his camping firm .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A few young fisherman in Florida hauled in more than they bargained for when they went shark fishing last week off beaches of Broward County - they expected a few small sharks. What they got was a 700-pound, 14-foot hammerhead. Florida Atlantic University student Viktor Hluben and his friends knew they had something big after battling with the fish for more than 90 minutes. However, they didn't realize how big the animal was until they got it out of the water. Hooked: Viktor Hluben snagged a 14-foot, 700-pound hammerhead shark off the beach in southern Florida . Catch and release: After hauling the giant shark into shore, the group released it back into the ocean . 'We knew we had a giant fish on, we battled it for about an hour and . thirty minutes, and when we saw the massive dorsal fin, we knew we . hooked a giant shark,' Hluben told WPTV. Their intention was never to keep the shark - Hluben and his friends just wanted a few pictures to remember it by. 'The only thing I was thinking in my head was pictures, video, quick and get it back in the water,' Hluben said. After posing for a few photos with the giant shark, the group pushed it back into the ocean and it swam off. Shocked: Hluben and his friends knew they had a big fish, but they didn't realize until they saw its giant dorsal fin . A shark that size near the coast of Florida might seem hard to believe, but experts say even larger hammerheads are actually quite common in Florida. Mark Perry of the Florida Oceanographic Society tells WPTV that the Florida coastline is full of hammerheads that big - and some even bigger. According to Perry, hammerheads along the coast grow up to about 19 feet and actually are fairly common. He says, however, that hammerheads aren'ts as aggressive as tiger or bull sharks, which are responsible for many of the shark attacks in the area. Shrimp: Experts say 14 feet actually is small for hammerheads in Florida - many grow to be as large as 19 feet . Hluben is part of a group of young fisherman who call their group 'Landshark Fishing.' The group, Hluben says, fishes at night for large sharks. Hluben and his group of shark hunters have no intention of hurting the large sharks they haul in at the beach - they let the sharks go after bringing them in, and use 'circle hooks to ensure maximum health of the fish. Hluben says the monster they brought in last week has only inspired him to go bigger. 'Now I want to go out and catch a bigger shark, maybe a 1,000 pounder next time,' Hluben told the station.","Viktor Hluben and his friends batted the giant shark for 90 minutes before they were able to bring him to shore .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Smiling along with her fellow contestants, Charlotte Giles looks picture perfect as she celebrates being crowned the new Miss Hampshire. But cheers turned to jeers and a row erupted shortly afterwards when it emerged 23-year-old Miss Giles is actually from Twickenham, in Middlesex. Fellow contestant Michaela Cater, 19, even lodged a complaint against her, but the victory will stand because Miss Giles lives within 50 miles of the Hamshire border. Charlotte Giles, 23, has been crowned Miss Hampshire, but a row has broken out after it emerged she is actually from neighboring Middlesex . Despite smiling alongside Miss Giles (centre), fellow contestant Michaela Cater (third from right) lodged a complaint against her, calling the win 'silly' However, furious Cater is calling for the rule to be scrapped. She said: 'It doesn’t add up and it just seems a bit silly. I would not enter Miss Dorset because I don’t live there. 'How can she go to Miss England when she’s got a Miss Hampshire title but is from Middlesex? 'The locals know the contestants and they’re going to be like ""hold on, who is she? Has she done anything for our community?""' But Miss Giles today defended herself saying there was not a beauty pageant in her home county of Middlesex, as it is technically an historic county and is now mostly part of Greater London with sections in Berkshire, Hertfordshire and Surrey. She said: 'At the time, I wasn’t aware that anybody had a problem with me being from another county. 'Everyone at the event in Hampshire was really welcoming and made me feel very comfortable - especially when I was crowned the winner. 'There was no beauty pageant contest in Middlesex and because Hampshire is nearby and I have friends living there, I decided to enter. Under competition rules anyone from within 50 miles of the Hampshire border can compete. Miss Cater (left), named 'Miss Popularity' is calling for the rule to be scrapped and the tiara to be taken away from Miss Giles . 'It’s a shame that someone has reacted this way, but it’s not going to stop me, it’s all for Miss England. 'I don’t see what the problem is, it is quicker for me to get to Alton than some of the other girls driving from parts of Hampshire. 'I’m not sure the reaction is down to jealously but I can see where they are coming from.' Miss Cater is from Hythe, near Southampton, which is almost exactly the same distance from Alton as Twickenham, home to Miss Giles. Paula Langley, from Alton, who organises the beauty pageant each year, defended the decision to award Charlotte the Miss Hampshire title. The 43-year-old said: 'I have only had one complaint about Charlotte winning this year’s beauty pageant. 'None of the other girls have taken an exception to the geography of where Charlotte lives, apart from Michaela. 'But what else was Charlotte supposed to do? Not enter at all? It is not her fault her home county was not hosting a Miss England heat. Miss Giles has defended the win, saying there was no Middlesex competition, so she joined one nearby . 'If she didn’t apply for Miss Hampshire she would have been denied the opportunity to chase her dream - which wouldn’t have been fair. 'What people forget is that the regional heats are for Miss England - which is a national competition. 'It would have been wrong to deny Charlotte the opportunity.' Ms Langley, who runs production company Abbeyfield Films, compared the situation to the hit TV show The X Factor. She added: 'When people audition for The X Factor in Manchester, Cardiff and other cities, they don’t have to live there.

"By . Lizzie Parry . Attack: Former BMX champion Christopher Mahoney was spared jail after punching his ex-girlfriend in the face breaking her jaw in two places . A former BMX champion who broke his ex-girlfriend's jaw in a brutal attack as she pushed their child in a pram has walked free from court as a judge noted his 'competitive spirit'. The ex-British champion, formerly ranked sixth in the world, was described as a 'callous and controlling bully' by the mother of his child, Michelle Prescott. But standing in the dock at Liverpool Crown Court, Mahoney - a successful tattoo artist - was fighting back tears, his bottom lip quivering as he was sentenced for the attack. Visibly upset, Mahoney was sentenced to 12 months behind bars. But the judge suspended the sentence for two years, sending the 33-year-old free from court with a warning that if he commits any further violent offences he will be jailed. Recorder William Waldron QC told the court: 'Perhaps in keeping with some of those who have a competitive spirit you were used to having your own way.' The court heard that Mahoney had visited Miss Prescott's home to visit their two-year-old son in October last year. The couple had been in a four-year relationship, but she described him as 'a bully, callous and controlling', the court heard. Their relationship broke down in August last year. Mahoney 'did not take it well', but made arrangements to visit his son regularly. On October 27, when he called at Miss Prescott's home in Pemberton, Wigan, to pick up their son, but instead lashed out. He told Miss Prescott he did not want to take their son, and when questioned as to why, the court heard he claimed he did not have to give a reason, and began slamming doors. She rang her sister, concerned at his erratic behaviour, and while she was on the phone Mahoney tried to push his son away in the pram, prosecutor Christine Redmond told the court. 'She (Miss Prescott) tried to stop him, grabbing the pram and he punched her with an upper cut with his right fist making contact with her left jaw leaving her in real pain,' Ms Redmond said. 'She was still on the telephone at the time and was screaming and her sister said she would come round.' Jail: Mahoney, 33, (left) received a 12-month prison term suspended for two years. Recorder William Waldron QC (right) sent the former BMX champion free from court with a warning that if he commits a further violent offence he will face time behind bars . Doctors at Manchester Royal Infirmary told Miss Prescott and her family that the blow to her face had fractured the right hand side of her jaw in two places, through referred force. Miss Prescott, who has three older children, had to undergo surgery to insert metal plates and was in hospital for three days. She has lost her sense of taste, leaving everything tasting of cardboard, has numbness in her lower lip and has had to move home with her parents. Mahoney sent her a text apologising but in a Facebook message to a friend said that she had deserved the assault. Kevin Liston, defending, said that RampParks have an ongoing interest in Mahoney and his BMX talents. He added: 'He gives ongoing assistance to younger riders and there is clamour for him to return to competition.' Confession: Mahoney, pictured arriving at Liverpool Crown Court, with an unnamed woman, pleaded guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm . The judge, Recorder William Waldron, QC, said that Mahoney had been a sportsman of considerable ability. Mahoney claimed not to be able to recall the incident but the judge told him he believed that was 'a lack of memory through convenience'. He said he had left his victim both physically and emotionally scarred and he was only suspending the sentence because it had been an isolated incident of violence which he had admitted. He also has no previous convictions and had been on medication for depression at the time. 'It is said you are not only remorseful but regretful and ashamed and so should you be for what you did that day,' added Recorder Waldron. He placed him under supervision for 12 months, imposed a restraining order and ordered him to pay Â£100 victim surcharge. Mahoney, from Wigan, had pleaded guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm.","Christopher Mahoney lashed out, hitting his ex-girlfriend across the face .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . It is believed that humans discovered fire over a million years ago. And now a team of Israeli archaeologists have uncovered the site of a large hearth dating to around 300,000 years ago. The discovery of repeated fire building over a continuous period was made in Qesem Cave, an archaeological site near present-day Rosh Ha'ayin in Israel. A team of Israeli archaeologists have uncovered the site of a large hearth (pointed out by the blue arrow) where hominins may have tended to fires as early as 300,00 years ago. The discovery of repeated fire building over a continuous period was made in Qesem Cave, Israel . Historians have long questioned when humans began to control fire in order to use heat to suit their daily needs and this find hints that prehistoric humans already had a highly advanced social structures and intellectual capacity. Excavations in Qesem Cave have been ongoing since 2000 and have been headed up by Professor Avi Gopher and Ran Barkai of Tel Aviv University. Dr Ruth Shahack-Gross of the Kimmel Centre for Archeological Science at the Weizmann Institute, Israel, collected samples from the site and analysed them in the lab. Dr Shahack-Gross tested the micro-morphology of the ash by extracting a 'cubic chunk' of sediment from the hearth before hardening it in the lab. She then cut it into thin slices (pictured) that showed burnt bone and rock fragments within the grey ash residue . The discovery of repeated fire building over a continuous period was made in Qesem Cave (pictured) an archaeological site near present-day Rosh Ha'ayin in Israel . She identified a thick deposit of wood ash in the centre of the cave and used infrared spectroscopy to find that in the ash were specks of bone and soil that had been heated to very high temperatures – ‘conclusive proof’ of a hearth. Dr Shahack-Gross and her colleagues tested the micro-morphology of the ash by extracting a ‘cubic chunk’ of sediment from the hearth before hardening it in the lab. They then cut it into thin slices and examined them under a microscope to determine the exact composition of the materials to reveal how they were formed. In and around the hearth area the archaeologists also found large numbers of flint tools that they are sure were used for cutting meat, it was reported in the Journal of Archaeological Science. The graph shows the infrared spectrum of the grey sediments and that the dominant material is calcite - the mineral of which the wood ash is composed. An archaeologist excavates the cave (bottom left) and a micro-morphological image of grey sediment showing patches corresponding to the remains of wood ash is pictured top right. A scan of a thin section showing the layered burnt bones is pictured bottom right . They believe that differently-shaped flint tools found just a few metres away were used for other activities. The site also contained large numbers of burnt animal bones, which the experts think is further evidence that cave men used fires to cook meat. Dr Shahack-Gross and her colleagues said that their findings build upon other evidence that suggests the organisation of various ‘household’ activities into different parts of the cave, points to an organisation of space and a kind of social order that is typical of modern humans. They think the cave served as a kind of ‘base camp’ that prehistoric humans returned to again and again. Another recent study revealed that Neanderthals were a house-proud race who liked to return to a comfortable home after a long day of hunting, excavations of caves in Gibraltar (pictured) have revealed . Dr Shahack-Gross said: ‘These findings help us to fix an important turning point in the development of human culture – that in which humans first began to regularly use fire both for cooking meat and as a focal point – a sort of campfire for social gatherings.’ ‘They also tell us something about the impressive levels of social and cognitive development of humans living some 300,000 years ago.’ The researchers think that these findings are signs of substantial changes in human behaviour and biology that began with the appearance of new forms of culture and a new human species in the region some 400,000 years ago. A collapsed rock shelter in north-west Italy revealed that cavemen were tidy. The site (pictured) showed how they arranged their living space, assigning separate areas for preparing food, making tools and socialising, according to a study which was published in December . Archaeologists have recently found that Neanderthals living at different times and in different regions were quite domesticated and house proud. Scientists from Oxford University and Gibraltar museum found Neanderthals used a network of small caves for occasional hunting expeditions before returning to a larger base, which they called home. They unearthed stone tools and camp fires featuring the remains of seals, ibex and red deer, dating back more than 24,000 years. By analysing the artefacts and the density in which they were found in each cave in Gibraltar, a team of scientists was able to determine which site was used for what purpose. Gibraltar was inhabited by Neanderthals for 100,000 years, with radiocarbon dating suggesting they lived on the Rock possibly as recently as 24,000 years ago . Gorham's Cave, the largest of those excavated by the scientists from Gibraltar Museum and Oxford University, was also once home to hyenas. Scientists said: 'The paucity of large vertebrate remains from Gorham's Cave has been interpreted to be a consequence of housekeeping, thus implying longer-term occupation.' In another study, archaeologists discovered that Neanderthals lived in organised and tidy spaces - much in the same way as modern humans. They found an ancient cave shelter in Riparo Bombrini, Italy, which shows ancient man thoughtfully arranged their living space, assigning separate areas for preparing food, making tools and socialising. Dr Julien Riel-Salvatore, from the University of Colorado Denver, who led the research, said: 'There has been this idea that Neanderthals did not have an organised use of space, something that has always been attributed to humans. 'But we found that Neanderthals did not just throw their stuff everywhere but in fact were organised and purposeful when it came to domestic space.' Investigation of three Neanderthal levels at the cave site showed how areas were divided up for different activities. The top level, containing animal remains, seems to have been reserved for butchering animals. The middle level was a long-term sleeping area, and the bottom level a place for shorter stays.","Archaeologists made the find in Qesem Cave, near Rosh Ha'ayin in Israel .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . and Daily Mail Reporter . 'Multi-organ failure': The condition of Ariel Sharon is deteriorating, doctors admit . Former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon was fighting for his life last night after suffering  multiple organ collapse. The 85-year-old has been in a coma since having a devastating stroke in January 2006 while still in office. Dr Zeev Rotstein, director of  Tel Hashomer Hospital in Tel Aviv, said: 'He is in critical condition and his life is definitely in danger. 'The feeling of the doctors treating him and also that of the family with him is that there is a turn for the worse.' Mr Sharon's family are at his bedside following the news, Dr Rotstein said. Known as The Bulldozer for his hardline approach, Sharon’s career has stretched across Israel’s 65-year history. As one of Israel’s most famous generals he was known for his bold tactics and the occasional refusal to obey orders. He . is credited with helping to turn the tide of the 1973 Middle East war . when Arab armies launched a surprise attack on Israel, leading troops . across the Suez Canal and trapping part of the Egyptian army. A prominent hard-line voice over the decades, he was elected prime minister in 2001. In mid-2005, he directed a unilateral withdrawal of Israeli troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip, ending a 38-year military control of the territory. It was quite a turnaround for a man who had been a leading player in building Jewish settlements in captured territories. Impact: Mr Sharon, pictured with former US President George W. Bush shortly before his stroke, is one of Israel's most iconic and controversial political figures . He later bolted from his hard-line Likud Party and established the centrist Kadima Party. It seemed he was on his way to an easy re-election when he suffered the stroke in January 2006. His deputy, Ehud Olmert, took over and was elected prime minister a few months later. Mr Sharon had a first, small stroke in December 2005 and was put on blood thinners before experiencing a severe brain hemorrhage on Jan. 4, 2006. After spending months in the Jerusalem hospital where he was initially treated, Sharon was transferred to the long-term care facility at Tel Hashomer hospital. He was taken home briefly at one point but was returned several days later to the hospital, where he has been since. Although Sharon never regained full consciousness, his family has said he occasionally blinks his eyes and moves his fingers.","Mr Sharon has been in a coma for eight years following a stroke in 2006 .

"By . Martin Robinson . Allegations: Alan Doggett, choirmaster at Colet Court - the prep school for St Paul's - has been named as six men who allegedly abused boys . A choirmaster who helped launch the careers of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice has been named as one of six teachers at George Osborne's former school who allegedly abused boys as young as ten over at least two decades. The staff all worked at the prestigious St Paul's School in London - or its prep school Colet Court - between 1960 and the mid-1980s. Alan Doggett became close to Lloyd Webber and Rice and later conducted recordings of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Jesus Christ . Superstar and Evita. But the choirmaster is . believed to have been a serial abuser while teaching at Colet Court - . even making sex attacks part of his choir's audition process for some boys. He was allowed . to quietly resign his post when a string of indecent assaults came to light. Doggett was also an active member of the Paedophile Information Exchange . (PIE), an infamous pro-child-sex group who wanted the age of consent . lowered to ten. After he left Colet Court he was given a job at the equally prestigious City of London School . but threw himself under a train when he was charged with the indecent . assault of a ten-year-old boy in 1978. One of Doggett's alleged victims today accused St Paul's and Colet Court of 'hushing up' historic sex offences. He . said despite teachers being accused of abusing several pupils none of the four separate police . investigations were never instigated by the schools. Andrew Lloyd Webber told the Mail in 2012 he and Tim Rice were young struggling . composers who 'got a call from Alan Doggett, who had taught Julian, my brother'. Doggett . asked them to 'write something for the kids’ end of term concert' and . they chose the biblical story of Joseph, which had its first performance . at Colet in March 1968. Four months later it was recorded at Abbey Road . with the help of Doggett and the Colet boy's choir. Help: Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber in 1971 - three years after their first performance of Joseph at Colet Court, which later helped catapult them to stardom . Abuse: Doggett worked at Colet Court when it was based in Hammersmith, and allegedly touched boys inappropriately, including at choir auditions. Colet Court moved from here to Barnes for years ago . After Doggett's suicide in 1978, The Magpie, the Paedophile Information Exchange's magazine for members, advertised a . memorial service for him and said he should be remembered for . his ‘friendliness, integrity and loyalty’. PIE's . links to several leading members of the Labour party were revealed by the Mail last month, after it emerged . the notorious group had extraordinary ties with the National Council . for Civil Liberties - now known as Liberty. Alan Doggett - choirmaster: Allowed to resign from Colet Court after being accused of abusing boys. Killed himself in 1978 after being charged with child sex offences at another school. Was member of Paedophile Information Exchange. 'Alex Alexander' - housemaster: Accused of beating boys for sexual pleasure. Police never involved and believed to be dead. Patrick Marshall - rowing master: Arrested last month over alleged abuse of 15-year-old boy in late 1970s. He denies the allegations and has been bailed. Rev Paul Topham: Accused of abusing boys but police inquiry in 2000 led to no prosecution. He denied all allegations and died in 2012. Unnamed teacher: Allowed to leave school for 'family reasons' after violent porn found in room and register of boys he had beaten was discovered. Unnamed teacher: Arrested in 2000 for abuse in late 1980s. No further action after CPS said there was a lack of evidence. Today the St Paul's High Master Professor Mark Bailey . backed calls for a new police investigation and said: 'All such . allegations must be properly and fully investigated' and 'subjected to . the proper processes of justice'. An investigation by The Times has today shed light on historic abuse involving five other staff who may have assaulted dozens of boys at St Paul's or Colet Court over 20 years. St Paul's and Colet Court are considered among Britain's most prestigious schools. Chancellor . George Osborne and Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC were there at the . time of the alleged abuse but there is no suggestion either were . victims. Luke Redmond said from the age of 12 he was attacked by three teachers who touched him inappropriately or beat him for sexual pleasure. He is now 59 and married with children and says he needed to speak out about his ordeal at school for 'closure'. The allegations made by him and others involve Alan Doggett and five other staff, The Times' Chief Investigative Reporter, Andrew Norfolk has said. The most recent claims were made about Patrick Marshall, a geography and rowing tutor at St Paul's, who was arrested in February over the alleged abuse of a 15-year-old boy in 1979 and 1980. He was bailed and denies the allegations. Former Colet Court teacher Paul Topham, was accused of groping at least one child in his bed and forcing others to swim naked while he would touch them. He went on to become an Anglican priest, but a 2000 police inquiry into sexual abuse allegations never led to a prosecution and he denied all the allegations. He died in 2012 aged 80. Another teacher at Colet, known as 'Alex' Alexander,  would allegedly beat boys in his office with their trousers down and and then sit them on his knee 'until his face went very red', one boy said. He is presumed dead. The fifth teacher - another unnamed member of staff - was caught with a stash of sado-masochistic pornography in his office and a register of boys he liked to spank. He was allowed to leave for 'family reasons', The Times said today. Statement: St Paul's and its prep school said today it would help the police with any investigation into historic child abuse there . The sixth and final teacher, also unnamed, was investigated by police and arrested in 2000 after allegations of historic abuse in the late 1980s were made. But the Crown Prosecution Service decided there was insufficient evidence. In a statement St Paul's said: 'The allegations do not relate to any pupils or staff currently at the Schools. 'Any sexual abuse of children by an adult—and particularly a teacher—is abhorrent, a serious violation of trust, and an affront to the values of any caring community. 'Suspects should be investigated and subjected to the proper processes of justice'. Alan Doggett killed himself after he was arrested and charged with child sex offences in 1978. But Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice never forgot what the choirmaster did for their careers and also refused to accept he was guilty of abusing children. Doggett had got to know the composers through Lloyd Webber's cellist brother Julian , who he taught at a Westminster Under School - a prestigious prep school. After meeting Andrew, the Colet Court teacher invited the young writers to write a 'pop cantata' for an end of term concert. Rice, then 22, and Lloyd Webber, 19, admitted they were forced to 'swallow their pride' in 1967 and agree, but the decision would change their lives. Sir Andrew wrote in 2012: 'Frankly no one was much taken with our offerings but one day I got a call from Alan Doggett, head of music at Colet Court, St Paul’s junior school, who had taught Julian, my brother. 'Would I write something for the kids’ end of term concert? It had to involve all the school and be a story everyone knew. I called Tim. 'The first public performance of anything we had written would be on a Friday afternoon to an audience of bored parents, but after swallowing our pride, we agreed. 'At first we toyed with a James Bond story but decided that 007 might be a passing fad, so we thought about a bible tale. 'I had an excellent picture book called The Wonder Book Of Bible Stories. We chose the story of Joseph and his coat of many colours. It’s always easier to get stories for musicals from a picture book'. By the summer of 1968 Joseph was being recorded at Abbey Road with the help of Doggett and the Colet Court boy's choir. The following year allegations about sex offences led to the teacher's removal from St Paul's, but within a year he was back in a job elsewhere and teaching music to other boys. Doggett worked with Rice and Lloyd Webber until 1976, and was 'musical co-ordinator' for an Evita album. He also was conductor on a recording of Jesus Christ Superstar. But in 1978 he jumped in front of a train and left a note confirming it was 'best' to go 'the way of the Greek'. He was accused of abusing a boy, ten. Soon afterwards, in a joint statement, Lloyd Webber and Rice said: 'Alan was a . music and singing teacher of extraordinary talent. We have lost a . gifted colleague and a dear friend.' In Tim Rice's 1999 autobiograohy he said: 'I cannot believe that Alan was truly a danger, or even a minor menace, . to the many boys he worked with'. Lloyd Webber was said to have told friends: 'Doggett would never have been guilty of taking advantage of any young person in his charge'.","Allegations made about Alan Doggett and 5 others who worked at St Paul's .

Together: Mick Jagger's spokesperson confirmed that 'of course' they were still a couple when Scott killed herself but Jagger has been known to cheat on his partners in the past, as that was the reason for both divorces . Older brother Bambrough is said to have made the decision to move the funeral and final viewing from the West Coast to Los Angeles on behalf of Scott's grief stricken partner, Mike Jagger. The 70-year-old rocker lives in the city and has only just returned from a trip to Australia, where the Rolling Stones were on tour when he received the tragic news that Scott had taken her own life. Scott’s body had been held at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel on Manhattan’s Upper East Side since Wednesday, when the Medical Examiner’s office released it after confirming her death was a suicide, according to Page Six. On Sunday the wooden coffin was moved to the Hollywood Forever Funeral Home and Cemetery in Los Angeles. On Monday, a celebrity gossip claimed that one of their blind items had predicted Scott's death, anonymously writing she was was not well just four days before she killed herself. Her roots: L'Wren was adopted by Mormon parents . in Roy, Utah and raised as LuAnn Bambrough, as seen here in pictures . from her high school yearbook . A casket reportedly carrying the body of L'Wren Scott was moved from a New York City funeral home on Sunday morning to be transported to Los Angeles . Resting place? It has been reported that Jagger is pushing for Scott to be buried at Hollywood Forever cemetery . The site, Crazy Days and Nights, posted an item on Thursday March 13 about how a 'C list celebrity that is A list in her own little corner of the celebrity world' had disappeared and was going through a very rough patch with her cheating, shorter 'permanent A-lister ' boyfriend. Though the unsubstantiated claims were first posted as a blind item- and the name of the subject in question was left out of the post- the author later updated it after Scott's death was confirmed and claimed that she was the subject. Jagger's spokesman immediately denied any claims that the longterm couple had separated before her death. Though . Jagger's cheating has been cited as the cause for his two previous marriages, his representative . said that 'of course' the Rolling Stones frontman and the designer were . still together at the time of her death. No sources were revealed for the post nor is it clear how the anonymous blogger would have any inside knowledge to substantiate the claims. One . of the most tangible connections in the blind item alludes to the fact that . Scott cancelled her London Fashion Week show a few months before her . death. At the time, she cited delayed fabric orders but her financial . filings have shown that the U.K. end of her luxury brand was in debt. 'There . are reports she had a breakdown because he was cheating on her. She . canceled a huge event she was working on and has retreated into a . hospital to get help although some people say she is hiding out at her . home with medical professionals,' the item reads. Sourcing: Crazy Days And Nights is run by an anonymous blogger who identifies themselves only as 'Entertainment Lawyer' and they are known for having a number of shocking items that are sometimes later proved correct . Mystery solved: The original blind item was posted on Thursday March 13, days before her suicide on Monday March 17 but after her death was confirmed, the blogger revealed that she was the subject of the post . No confirmations have been made regarding any medical treatment she may have received ahead of her death. Posts on Crazy Days and Nights are . attributed to an anonymous blogger who calls themselves 'Entertainment . lawyer' and there is no telling who their sources are. The New York Post's gossip columnist Cindy Adams also made outrageous and unsubstantiated claims that her friends were aware of her troubles and made no motions to help. 'Her stylist friends, fashion friends, p.r. friends, critic friends all say they knew she was hemorrhaging financially. Nobody helped,' Adams wrote today. The blind item was not the only sign of chatter about problems between Scott and Jagger to come out in recent days, however. The . Mail on Sunday has learned that the designer secretly remortgaged the . luxury Manhattan apartment for $1.2million (£700,000) then asked Jagger . to bail her out in February last year, triggering an argument. Over . the weekend, a source close to Jagger, who is worth a reported . £200 million, revealed he had been ‘blindsided’ by the extent of his . lover’s woes. Inseparable: Dating since 2001, the couple first . remained private and then began attending events together years later, . (seen left in 2006 and right in November of last year) The source emphatically denied claims by Scott’s friends that the couple’s relationship had been strained by a series of rows over money, saying:  ‘They were inseparable to the end. He did everything he could to help and support her. There was an element of frustration [for Mick] that money was being poured away into a bottomless pit. He wasn’t the only investor to feel that way.’ But Phillip Bloch, the stylist who befriended Scott, 49, when both started out as models in Paris, claimed: ‘Everyone knew the relationship was in trouble. Her spending could be reckless. There were massive rows.’ Another friend added: ‘There was a massive argument last year when Mick learned she had secretly borrowed against the apartment. Frozen out: Scott's sister Jan Shane (pictured) wants her to be buried in their family plot in Roy, Utah . ‘He bailed her out but she was going round saying he had told her, “Call me when you sort out your mess.”’ Jagger’s spokesman insisted he had never said this. There are also reportedly new tensions between Scott's family and Jagger, as the designer's estranged sister has called for her to be buried in the family plot in Roy, Utah. Scott, who was adopted by a Mormon family and raised by the name Luann Bambrough, was close with her brother Randall and hadn't spoken to her sister Jan Shane in six years. Randall, a financial adviser, had been working with her to sort out her business debt in recent months, has reportedly been in discussions with Jagger and agreed to his request to have the designer's body flown to Los Angeles for a funeral in California.  Jan told The Mail on Sunday that she has been left completely out of the negotiations and hopes that L'Wren's body will end up in the already-carved plot next to their parents. ‘No one has told me anything about a funeral. I’ve not had a single call from anyone in the Jagger camp. I’m beside myself,' she told The Mail On Sunday. ‘Are they going to make it so secret that her own family is banned from attending?’","Brittany Penebre, the assistant who found L'Wren Scott's body in her Manhattan apartment, arrived in L.A. from New York on Monday .

Jayden went missing more than two weeks ago when she was last seen leaving Didcot railway station, Oxfordshire, at around 4.30pm on December 3. Her body was found last night in the . Great Western Cemetery next to All Saint's church where police said . there was ‘evidence of recent and unauthorised disturbance’ Tests will now take place to establish the cause of death after Jayden’s body was removed from the scene yesterday evening. The . officer leading the investigation, Detective Chief Superintendent Andy . Murray, today said: 'We had prepared Jayden's family for the worst but . I'm afraid nothing can prepare you for the loss of your child. 'They remain heartbroken, they remain devastated, and our thoughts are with them at this time.' Mr Murray said formal identification had not yet taken place. In a brief statement at Thames Valley Police HQ in Kidlington, near Oxford, Mr Murray said: 'It’s been a long and difficult night but, as you probably know, we discovered a body in a particular grave in All Saints’ Cemetery in Didcot and I believe that body to be Jayden Parkinson, our missing teenager. 'Formal identification has not yet taken place. Jayden’s body was removed from the cemetery late last night. 'Our only work in that cemetery now consists of returning that cemetery to its previous state. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Police were today continuing to keep guard at All Saint's Church in Didcot following the discovery last night . Missing: Jayden Parkinson (left) has not been seen since leaving Didcot station at 4.30pm on December 3. Former boyfriend Ben Blakeley, 22, (right) appeared this week at Oxford Crown Court charged with her murder . 'A post-mortem will take place today . to try and determine how Jayden died and our management of various crime . scenes in and around Didcot will be dependent on the outcome of that . post-mortem.' Mr Murray added: 'I’d like to thank the public for all their support and . I’d like to thank you, the media, for your help in this case. 'This is likely to be the last time I make any public comment before the outcome of the trial.' Following the discovery of the body police scaled down their investigation at the graveyard. Officers were seen removing shovels, rakes and bins, putting them onto a police trailer. Forensics teams left at around 11am and bags were also put into a white van. Silver metal railings used to line the search area with blue tarpaulin were dismantled while a workman turned up with a delivery of soil on a low loader. It was transferred on wheelbarrows and delivered to the grave site. Floral tributes have been left at the scene at All Saint's Church, in Didcot, following the discovery . A team of more than 100 officers and detectives, backed by specialists from the National Crime Agency, has spent much of the past week carrying out searches.

This photograph shows forensic workers at the Great Western Cemetery for the investigation . On Tuesday, Mr . Murray said police had received 'significant and highly relevant . information' which led police to focus their efforts on a specific grave . in the cemetery. The teenager was last seen leaving Didcot railway station at 4.27pm on December 3. Police . said there was 'no indication' she was still alive, revealing Jayden . had not used her mobile phone or accessed her bank account in the days . since she had been reported missing. Officers . had previously issued an appeal for information about a man seen . struggling with a suitcase just outside Upton at about 2am on Monday, . December 9. Police said the information they had received had led their search efforts to a specific grave . Investigation leader Mr Murray said there was evidence at the graveyard of 'recent and unauthorised disturbance' A search of farmland on the outskirts of the village took place following the sighting. Officers . said the same man was seen with the same suitcase in the Lydalls Road . area of Didcot - where All Saints is located - at about 3.30am the same . day. Detectives have since recovered several suitcases, one of which 'may well be significant', according to Mr Murray. Jayden, who was nicknamed Tiny by her . mother, had moved out of her family home in Didcot ‘a matter of weeks’ before she vanished from a youth hostel in Oxford called 1 Foot Forward. Superintendent . Christian Bunt said there had been ‘no bust up’ with her family or . friends to trigger her out-of-character disappearance. Search: Officers have been searching fields in Upton, Oxfordshire, for the missing teenager . Farmland: Police carried out a detailed search of an area of farmland just outside the village of Upton, near Didcot to trace Jayden Parkinson . The . youngster left school last summer after taking her GCSEs and was not . believed to be studying or in employment at the time of her . disappearance. She was . said to have often changed her hair colour. Until recently, she had . lived with her mother, Samantha Shrewsbury, and her sister in Didcot. Police also confirmed that during the course of their investigation it was . suggested Jayden might have been pregnant at the time of her . disappearance. In a . statement issued after Jayden's former boyfriend appeared in court . accused of murder, Mr Murray said: 'During the course of the . investigation there has been some suggestion that Jayden may be . pregnant.

"By . Phil Vinter . For years Tim Henman and Andy Murray have put fans through sporting torture on a giant screen situated just metres from the live action at Wimbledon. Now ticketless London 2012 supporters are set to go through the same torment as organisers announce plans for a giant screen  in the heart of the Olympic park where up to 10,000 people can catch all the drama. The woodland area, to be known as Park Live, is yet to be given a nickname but possible options are 'Hoy's Hill ', 'Mo (Farah's) Mound' or even 'Radcliffe's ridge'. Spectacle: Park Live will feature a giant screen which is the size of two double-decker buses. Up to 10,000 people will be able to soak up the atmosphere in the shadow of the Olympic stadium . Other alternatives mooted include Pendleton's Park after Gold-medal winning cyclist Victoria Pendleton and Dai Greene's Fields in honour of Welsh champion hurdler Dai Greene. The majority of the GB team is yet to be selected, leaving the final decision on a nickname open until the big stars of British sport have been confirmed. The space will boast a giant double-sided screen in the River Lea and a 'natural amphitheatre' that has been sculpted especially for the event. It will be staffed by 1,000 British Airways' 'BA Hosts', made up of volunteers from the airline and their families, and spectators can watch athletes being interviewed on the presentation stage. Lord Coe, chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, said: 'Whether it's 'Halsall Hill', 'Pistorius Park' or 'Dai Greene Fields', our plans for Park Live will create a green and colourful place for fans to cheer their heroes and soak up the Olympic Park atmosphere. 'With lush lawns surrounded by wildflower meadows and rustling reeds, a trip to Park Live will be a truly unforgettable experience.' Park Live will feature timber . seating, frog ponds, loggeries, wildflower meadows, woodlands, . tree-lined footpaths and reed beds with over 30 species of native reeds, . rushes, wet wildflowers and irises. It . will be open from early morning to late evening for spectators to visit . before and after sporting events and organisers have also outlined . their ambition to open it up to people without tickets for a stadium . event. Olympic gold . medal winner Denise Lewis said: ‘It looks like it could be the 'Henman . Hill' of the Games. I know the athletes, their families and guests at . the Olympic Park will be thrilled to have a dedicated place for people . to come together.’ Scenic: Perched over the River Lea the venue will be open from early morning to late evening for spectators to visit before and after sporting events as well as people who don't have tickets . Double-sided: The Park will be staffed by 1,000 British Airways' 'BA Hosts', made up of volunteers from the airline and their families, and spectators can watch athletes being interviewed on the presentation stage . Once the planning process is concluded in the coming weeks, construction work will start on the temporary double-sided 14m high, 132 square metre screen, which is the height of three double-decker buses and will sit on a purpose built structure on the river bed. Alongside live sporting action, Park Live will feature a host of other activities including live entertainment, short films on the creation of the parklands and visits from Olympic and Paralympic athletes. Set in the newly created wetland bowl in the north of the Olympic Park the area will feature non-drinkable recycled water provided by the new Thames Water Old Ford treatment plant. It will be the UK’s largest ever urban river and wetland planting project with 300,000 wetland plants grown on the Gower peninsula in Wales and Thetford in Norfolk. More than 30 species of native reeds, rushes, grasses, sedges, wet wildflowers and irises will also feature, with around a third grown from cuttings and seeds collected from the Olympic Park before construction started. Hoy Hill? Olympic cycling champion Chris Hoy whose surname is in he mix . for the naming of the spectator park metres from the Olympic stadium . The green oasis will also host wildlife habitats including frog ponds, loggeries, wetlands, woodlands, irrigation ditches, fish channels for spawning, otter holts, kingfisher nests, bat boxes and strips of Toadflax planted to attract the rare Toadflax Brocade caterpillar. The armed forces have begun preparations to help with security during the Olympics with marine commandos yesterday holding a huge security exercise off the south coast to show off their strength ahead of the Games. Weymouth . and Portland in Dorset will play host to the sailing where the . Albion-class amphibious assault warship HMS Bulwark will play a key role . in protecting the events. The Navy gave a rare glimpse of its 18,500-ton flagship, along with its marines in action. Rapier surface-to-air missiles . have also been showcased at Blackheath Army Cadet Centre, in south east . London, as part of the massive 2012 security test on land, sea and in . the air. Ready to protect: A Royal Navy helicopter flies lands on HMS Bulwark . The flagship HMS Bulwark off Weymouth and Portland is being prepared for the Olympics . The Navy's show of force was part of the massive 2012 security test on land, sea and in the air . Colonel Jon . Campbell, commander of the Joint Ground Based Air Defence, said: 'We . have done as much as we can to allay people's fears. 'The Rapier system has a world-class radar on it and is particularly good at picking up low and slow-moving objects in the sky. 'It means we're able to get the very best picture of what is happening in the skies of London.' Air . Vice Marshall Stuart Atha added: 'We want the focus to be on Usain Bolt . this summer and not us. We're very proud to be part of this plan to . deliver a safe and secure Olympics.' The . Lexington Building in Tower Hamlets and the Fred Wigg Tower in Waltham . Forest, both in east London, have been identified as potential sites for . the High Velocity Missiles. Rapier missiles would be positioned . on Blackheath Common and in Oxleas Wood, both in south east London, and . at William Girling Reservoir Chain in Enfield and Barn Hill at . Netherhouse Farm in Epping Forest, both in north London, should the Air . Security Plan be approved by the Government. Col Campbell said the sites had been chosen to avoid having weapons inside the Olympic Park. He said: 'We're trying to . de-militarise this and let the sport do the talking. The Lexington . Building is the best available location away from the Olympic Park.' 'When you launch a Rapier missile and . shoot down an aircraft, it's not like the whole thing vanishes. It's 100 . tons of metal, scraps, and other stuff that is coming down,' said Jan . Wind, a retired Dutch Navy captain who is director of the Hague-based . Wiser Consultancy. 'If a . Rapier is used, the damage could be just about the same as the . intentions of the terrorist - only on another spot. The goal of the . terrorists will be met in a certain sense,' Wind said. Royal Marine commandos in rigid inflatables wait to rejoin the Royal Navy flagship HMS Bulwark . A soldier runs past the defence battery deployed at Blackheath Common . The military demonstrate some of the air defence weapons that may be utilised to protect London during the Olympics . It's . rare for the British military to publicise the location of its weapons, . but the military says it hopes that any potential attacks will be . deterred by showing the missile strength and other defense assets such . as Typhoon fighter jets. Ground-to-air missiles have been a . fixture of Olympic games and large VIP events in the post-9/11 world, . but London's missiles have sparked outrage among residents of an . apartment block who learned that the Rapiers might be stationed on their . roof. They say the missiles . are creating a climate of fear - which security experts say is exactly . the point. That's because the systems are more valuable as deterrents . than as deployed weapons, Mr Wind said. 'The . British army and air force don't do all this to really shoot down a . terrorist aircraft, they do it to display their determination to do so, . which will hopefully prevent the terrorists from attacking,' Mr Wind . said. 'If you know that there are 500 policeman outside the jewellery store, you will not go there and try to rob the store.' The Ministry of Defence it has not decided where it will ultimately station the missile batteries. Meanwhile as Olympic fever grows stills from the final instalment of the animated film featuring mascots Mandeville and Wenlock have been released. The movie tells the story of the pair who were born when two drops of molten steel feel as building work finishes on the Olympic stadium. Once cooled they are picked up by a man named George. Back home he decides to make a gift for his grandchildren out of the steel drops. The two children take the mascots up to the attic and place them on the windowsill when a rainbow forms going through the house. The rainbow brings Wenlock and Mandeville to colour and to life where they learn about sport from the children, posters and the TV. The story which features GB Olympic athletes ends with the words: 'Then suddenly the rainbow disbanded; Wenlock and Mandeville know it’s time to go, their journey is just beginning. So many adventures to have, so many people to tell, but they will meet again; in London, in 2012. They’ll be there, You’ll be there, the whole world will be there.'

"By . Sean Poulter . The Union Flag could be banished from packets of British meat under rules proposed by the EU. The diktat would also apply to logos and flags representing Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Any such move would infuriate retailers and farmers. It would also annoy shoppers keen to support British farms, where animal welfare standards are now among the highest in the world. Restrictions: Packaged meat products on sale in high street chains such as Sainsbury's (pictured) will no longer be allowed to have a Union flag on their labels . The European Commission has drawn up proposals for a standardised fresh meat labelling regime for all 28 member states. The . plans are intended to help consumers understand the origins of what . they are eating because of concerns that labels are misleading. But . officials at Britain’s food and farming department, Defra, claim the . current draft scheme could have serious unintended consequences. While . a pack would have to carry a UK reference to identify where the animal . was reared and a second to state the country of slaughter, all other . symbols would be banned. This . would stop the use of the Union Flag, the Scottish Saltire, the dragon . of Wales and the Red Tractor logo, which is designed to identify British . farmed food. The new . restrictions would apply to all fresh meat other than beef. Beef . labelling has its own set of rules, set up in the wake of the BSE . scandal. Defra is writing to suppliers and retailers asking for . responses to take back to Brussels to try to get the proposals changed. Lindsay . Harris, the department’s deputy director of food and material security . and standards, told The Grocer magazine: ‘The draft proposals revealed . this week suggest other voluntary information such as symbols like a . flag would not be allowed at all. 'Crazy': Industry experts say the planned restrictions on packaged products, including pork (file picture), would cause chaos on the high street. ‘There . are many examples where descriptions other than the member state are . used, such as a flag. I imagine this will be a major concern to a number . of states.’ He stressed that the proposals were not set in stone, and . added that other countries were also likely to demand the right to . continue using national flags and other symbols. The British Retail Consortium said national flags were useful for shoppers. Its . deputy director of food policy, Andrea Martinez-Inchausti, said: . ‘Surely it is a good thing for products such as British pork chops to . flag up their country of origin with something like a Union Jack. It’s . not something to be vilified.’ She . also believes that putting the country of slaughter as well as origin . on the label is unnecessary, and could create confusion and extra red . tape. Country of origin . labelling is supported by British farmers. At present, imported meat can . be labelled as British if it undergoes processing in this country. In . the past this has meant that pies, sausages and other products made . here with meat imported from abroad could be labelled as made in . Britain. Eventually, the EU proposals may be extended to stop this scam. But farmers are concerned that the plan to ban national symbols is a . step too far. Deborah . Cawood, of the National Farmers’ Union, said: ‘We know that consumers . want to be certain where their food comes from. It is critical that . labelling spells out where the animals involved are born and reared. ‘British . food is recognised for its quality and production standards. UK farmers . follow some of the most stringent standards in the world. It is . important that their products are easily identified in the market . place.’ The European Commission insisted that the information provided by Britain’s food and farming department, DEFRA, and the British Retail Consortium about the threat to the use of national flags and logos was wrong. A spokesman confirmed that the EC is drawing up new compulsory rules to standardise the labels on pre-packaged meat to provide information on the country of origin. This will be combined with a new regime for voluntary labels that will allow the use of flags and logos. ‘The Commission has no intention of banning flags and other logos on pre-packaged meat,’ he said.","Proposals would also apply to symbols representing Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales .
Industry experts blasted the plans as 'crazy' and said it would cause chaos .

"By . Associated Press . A defense expert testified Monday that a Colorado man is unfit to be trialled for the murder of a Montana teacher because he is 'easily confused and displays the intelligence of an 11-year-old', leaving him unable to understand the case against him. But defense testimony also revealed that doctors at Montana State Hospital suspected 24-year-old Michael Keith Spell was 'pretending' when the defendant could not answer some questions during a recent mental fitness evaluation. Spell is charged with the attempted kidnapping and murder of 43-year-old Sherry Arnold, who was killed in January, 2012, after going out for a morning jog in her hometown of Sidney. At the time Spell confessed to the murder, previous court documents show, and even tried to lead police to the body, saying that he and the co-accused, Lester Van Waters Jr., 47, were under the influence of crack cocaine. Spell told investigators he pulled her . into a car and Waters choked her to death by before they buried her in a . shallow grave on a farmstead near Williston. FILE - In this Feb. 28, 2012 file photo, Michael Keith Spell arrives at Montana state district court in Sidney, Mont. for a hearing in the case of murdered Montana teacher Sherry Arnold. The Colorado man's bid to avoid trial and a potential death sentence in the killing of an eastern Montana teacher goes before a state judge Monday, March 24, 2014 to decide if the defendant is incompetent due to mental disability. His attorneys say 24-year-old Spell has the mental capacities of a first-grader and is unfit for trial. If Judge Richard Simonton agrees, Spell could be sent to a state institution indefinitely. (AP Photo/Matt Brown, File) Beloved: Veteran Sidney High School math teacher Sherry Arnold was out for a morning jog in January 2012 when she was abducted at random, choked to death, and buried 50 miles away in Williston, North Dakota . The Chamber of Commerce in Sidney, Mont. offers prayers for high school teacher Sherry Arnold, 43, in January 2012 after she went missing. One of the men accused of her murder, Michael Keith Spell, is making a bid to avoid trial . Co-accused: Lester Van Waters is also on trial for the murder of Sherry Arnold. He and Spell were said to be under the influence of cocaine at the time of the alleged kidnapping . Both have pleaded guilty and face the death penalty. If Judge Richard Simonton agrees with defense claims that Spell is incompetent because of mental disability, he could avoid trial, be sent to a state institution and become eligible for eventual release. The case has highlighted the steep social costs of a Northern Plains oil boom that drew the defendants to the region looking for work. Crime rates spiked in eastern Montana and neighboring parts of North Dakota over the past several years, and the killing of the popular Sidney High School math teacher stood out for its violent, random nature. Testifying for the defense on Monday was psychologist Greg Olley, a clinical professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. Olley said he interviewed Spell twice in recent months and found that he could answer rote questions but nothing more substantive. 'I observed him being really confused most of the time about the questions he was asked, and not being able to provide adequate answers to show he could understand the conversation,' Olley said. 'He's not smart.' As questioning continued, defense attorney Al Avignone revealed that doctors for the state suspected Spell of feigning ignorance to some questions. Olley replied that Spell had 'a terrible memory' that leaves him unable to retain much information. Dearly missed: Mrs Arnold, a popular maths teacher from the small town of Sidney, Montana, was on a morning jog on January 7 when she disappeared . Prosecutors, led by Richland County Attorney Mike Weber, sought to exclude Olley's testimony on Spell's competence because the psychologist did not submit a written report on the matter. Simonton did not immediately act on the request. The doctors who evaluated Spell at the state hospital in Warm Springs are expected to take the stand on Tuesday. Even if the disability claim is accepted by the court, Spell still could be found competent, said Margaret Nygren, executive director of the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities. 'Intellectual disability is a continuum,' Nygren said. 'It's certainly possible someone could have intellectual disability at the higher end and participate in their defense.' Court documents, including law enforcement affidavits and testimony from Spell's accomplice say the defendants arrived in Montana after a drug-fueled drive from Parachute, Colo., and spotted Arnold along a Sidney street. Arnold died after Spell choked or otherwise asphyxiated her during an attempted abduction, according to the documents. Hundreds of people searched for Arnold after her disappearance. Her body was found more than two months later when co-defendant Lester Van Waters, Jr. led authorities to a shallow gravesite near a farm outside Williston, N.D. Michael Spell told investigators he pulled Sherry Arnold into a car and Waters choked her to death by before they buried her in a shallow grave on a farmstead near Williston . Van Waters reached a plea deal that would allow him to avoid a death sentence in exchange for testimony against Spell if the case goes to trial. Spell implicated Van Waters as the killer in an FBI interview following his arrest. Van Waters, 50, has a lengthy criminal record and served several prison stints in his native Florida before meeting up with Spell in Colorado. His attorneys have not denied Spell's involvement in the events leading up to Arnold's death, but say there is no ""conclusive evidence"" he was the one who killed her. Defense attorney Al Avignone said he expects as many as four mental disability experts to testify at the hearing, including staff from the state hospital and two experts for the defense. Spell is not expected to appear at the hearing. Designations of mentally disabled depend on three factors â€” intellectual capacity, commonly measured by IQ score; the ability to perform basic life functions; and evidence that the disability was present before the age of 18. Spell was declared incompetent to proceed twice in Colorado â€” in a 2010 drug case and a 2007 case when he was a juvenile. Determining a defendant's competency becomes much harder when the disability is not considered severe, according to experts. That's the case with Spell, who worked various jobs and fathered a child with his girlfriend before his arrest, but according to his attorneys has consistently scored below 75 on IQ tests.","Sherry Arnold, a 44-year-old math teacher from Sidney, Montana, was on a morning jog on January 7, 2012, when she was abducted .

"By . Emma Glanfield . People living in areas where water fluoridation schemes are in place are less likely to have tooth decay than those in other regions, according to a Public Health England (PHE) report (file picture) Fluoride in tap water can reduce the chance of getting tooth decay and improve overall dental health, a new report has revealed. People living in areas where water fluoridation schemes are in place are less likely to have tooth decay than those in other regions, according to a Public Health England (PHE) report. Experts said there are ‘significant benefits’ of the schemes after compiling the first national report on the measure. During the early 20th century lower levels of tooth decay were noted in places which had certain fluoride levels in drinking water. Over the last 50 years, schemes have been put in place in various places across England to adjust the levels of the mineral in water supplies to mimic the effect. In England, 14 out of 152 local authorities have water fluoridation schemes in place - covering six million people. In these areas the level of fluoride in the water is adjusted to one part per million. In the latest report, experts measured the dental health of five-year-olds with baby teeth and 12-year-olds with adult teeth from both fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas. On average, 15% fewer five-year-olds had tooth decay that needed intervention in fluoridated areas, the authors said. And when deprivation and ethnicity - both important factors for dental health - were taken into account this figure rose to 28% fewer cases of tooth decay. The report also revealed there were 11% fewer 12-year-olds with tooth decay in fluoridated areas compared to non-fluoridated areas. This figure rose to 21% when deprivation and ethnicity were taken into account, the authors said. And in areas which participate in the water adjustment scheme there were 45% fewer hospital admissions for tooth decay among children aged one to four. Experts also found that the population rates of kidney stones and bladder cancer were lower in fluoridated areas. While the findings are only a crude analysis, the authors found that kidney stones episodes were 5.3% lower in fluoridated areas and rates of bladder cancer were 4.4% lower in fluoridated areas compared to non-fluoridated places. But they said more research was needed to assess these findings. A previous study has linked fluoridation to dental fluorosis - where white flecks are seen on the teeth. The research compared rates of the effect on fluoridated Newcastle and non-fluoridated Manchester. They found that the number of 12-year-old children in Newcastle with moderate dental fluorosis was around 1% compared to 0.2% in Manchester. But the authors said the overall dental benefit of the schemes were ‘important’. Exerts found that on average 15% fewer five-year-olds had tooth decay that needed intervention in fluoridated areas than those living in non-fluoridated areas (picture posed by model, file picture) ‘Tooth decay is a significant public health problem in England,’ the report states. ‘Sizeable inequalities exist between affluent and deprived communities, and it is a common cause of hospital admissions in children.’ Professor John Newton, chief knowledge officer at PHE, said: ‘There is a good deal of speculation about water fluoridation schemes. This report provides new data which is direct evidence of the safety and efficacy of water fluoridation in England. ‘There is no evidence of any effect on general health in fluoridated areas compared to non-fluoridated areas. There are important benefits in terms of dental health - it does look as if there are really significant benefits in those areas that have water fluoridation schemes. ‘We will use this report as a basis for discussions with local authorities on the scope and content of further reports and on the role of fluoridation as a public health measure.’ Sue Gregory, director of dental public health at PHE, added: ‘These findings highlight the important contribution that water fluoridation makes to children's dental health and general well-being. ‘It is notable that the benefits of this public health measure appear to be greatest for children living in the most deprived areas of the country. ‘This is significant for reducing the large differences we see in dental health between deprived and more affluent areas of the country.’","Experts said there were 'significant benefits' of water fluoridation schemes .

Britain's welfare system stops youngsters aspiring to have careers while employment is 'frowned upon' in certain families, a human resources boss for the retailer has said. Speaking to a Lords inquiry into youth unemployment, Tanith Dodge said some young people she interviewed for the company's Make Your Mark apprenticeship scheme could not decide whether employment was worth their while. She added many on the scheme were from families who had been on benefits for a number of generations. Ms Dodge also compared this country's welfare system to 'treacle' and said it made life without work too attractive. This week, the Office for National Statistics revealed there were 2.39million unemployed people in the UK from July to October 2013. 866,000 people had been unemployed for over one year and 444,000 people had been unemployed for over two years, their figures showed. 941,000 young people aged between 16 and 24 are unemployed, figures suggested. In the month of November 323,300 18 to 24-year-olds claimed Job Seekers Allowance. According to Department of Education statistics, the number of 16 to 24-year-olds who are classified as NEETs (not in education, employment and training) was 1,066,000. Speaking to the panel yesterday, Ms Dodge said: 'When we talk to some of these young people, their biggest barriers are the first few weeks when they go back to an environment where nobody works.' The Make Your Mark scheme aims to develop workplace skills of people aged 16-25 in a four-week unpaid internship. As part of the scheme, Ms Dodge said the retailer has set up support groups for their younger employees to discuss working so they don’t feel alienated when they returned home to their jobless families. In an article in The Telegraph, Ms Dodge explained: 'If they [young people] have grown up in a family where everybody is on benefits and they are given the opportunity for work experience, they do not know if it is going to work out. 'They have to come off benefits and that is a deterrent for some young people as they do not want to cut the umbilical cord.' Her critique comes months after the Government announced plans for long-term welfare claimants to take up community service for their benefits. Outspoken: Tanith Dodge said many of the young people on the M&S apprenticeship scheme come from families that have claimed benefits for generations . The so-called 'work for benefit' scheme will see hundreds of thousands of claimants completing work such as cooking meals for the elderly, cleaning graffiti and picking up litter under new strict conditions. Chancellor George Osborne announced the scheme at the Tory party's autumn conference. He said: 'We are saying there is no option of doing nothing for your benefits, no something-for-nothing any more. 'They will do useful work to put something back into their community; making meals for the elderly, clearing up litter, working for a local charity. 'Others will be made to attend the job centre every working day.' Ms Dodge also said she was in favour of Universal Credit - a Department of Work and Pensions reform which will see several benefits merged into a single payment. The plan, spearheaded by Iain Duncan Smith, would ensure those in work were always better off than people on benefits. Earlier this month, it was revealed that more than 50 families were receiving benefits which amounted to almost £70,000 a year. Figures released by the Department for Work and Pensions showed some families were given the sizable income before the department introduced a £26,000 cap in April. Fifty-one families had their payouts cut by at least £400 a week. This means they were previously receiving at least £900 a week - the equivalent of £46,800 or £68,000 a year before tax. Plans: At the Tory party conference in September, George Osborne revealed plans to make the unemployed do community work for their benefits . Last month the Office for National Statistics confirmed the number of unemployed people in Britain had fallen. More than 30 million people were said to be in work for the first time in British history. David Cameron claimed that the Government’s economic plan ‘is working’ as unemployment fell by 99,000 in the three months to October, reducing the jobless rate from 7.6 per cent to 7.4 per cent, the lowest level since 2009. There were drops in almost every region outside the South –  especially the West Midlands, the North West and the East. It has been estimated that another £12bn a year of cuts to welfare will be needed after 2015 in order to avoid accelerating spending reductions in other government departments.","Youngsters do not see employment as worthwhile, a M&S boss has said .

"By . Bianca London . The ladies of Essex (and certain men - yes you, Joey) have long championed a glowing tan. But new research by Chloe Sims' tanning brand has revealed that British women are so desperate to get a sun tan they dedicate over a year of their lives to baking their skin. On the back of this, Chloe Sims has posed in a new campaign wearing nothing but a thong and a fake golden glow to showcase the power of a bottle tan. Scroll down for video . Bottle tan: The Only Way Is Essex star Chloe Sims has posed in her underwear to prove you can get a glowing tan without setting foot on a sunbed . Chloe, who is the face of her own Montana Tan's Starship Range, spoke out about the shocking new suntanning stats: 'I'm . in shock that women are still spending so much time on sunbeds and in . the sun damaging their skin and putting their health at risk too.' According to Chloe's research, it seems that we are a nation of copy-Kim's with the Kardashian being crowned as the nation's tanning idol with 35 per cent of votes. Shocked: Chloe, whose fake tan brand Montana Tan carried out the new research, said she finds new stats about women spending a year of their life tanning 'shocking' The reality TV star and Vogue cover girl was closely followed by Cheryl Cole (25 per cent), while Helen Flanagan was voted as having the worst tan. According to the research, there is some confusion as to whether Katie Price is a bronze . goddess or a tanning disaster as she was voted third best and . second worst celebrity tan. The results show that women aren't . turning their back on the fake stuff either with over 70 per cent of the . women questioned claiming that they still use self-tan on a regular . basis - and the majority apply it at least once a week. And the reason? The poll revealed that women believe that fake tan can help them get a job and even a boyfriend.

"By . Chris Greenwood . Rioting hooligans could soon be repelled by police officers brandishing a futuristic ‘sound blaster’ weapon. Government officials are considering a bizarre 21st century device that projects a powerful beam of sound up to 400ft. Those targeted said it creates a ‘very nasty’ siren-like sound in their heads which made their brain feel like it is ‘rattling around’. Riots: Police officers trying to deal with rioting hooligans could soon use an A_WASP, pictured, to quell crowds. The device blasts a powerful beam of sound 400ft making a person's brain feel as though it is 'rattling around' Home Office boffins said they are ‘very interested’ in the acoustic weapon which is being developed by a British firm. It has already been shown off at several police conferences, including one in the US attended by Met chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe. At another, in Ryton, near Coventry, in November, several of the country’s most senior officers took part in an outdoor demonstration. One of the unofficial guinea pigs said: ‘It looks like a comedy gun but the effect is certainly not funny at all. ‘It felt like there was something inside my head, I felt a bit nauseous, and all I wanted to do was get away from it.’ An urgent search for a new generation of non-lethal weapons to help quell violence was sparked by the ugly scenes of the 2011 summer riots. Tests of a long-range CS gas or pepper spray gun, which could be fired over 100ft, are in their final stages. New gadgets: An urgent search for a new generation of . non-lethal weapons to help quell violence was sparked by the ugly . scenes of the 2011 summer riots - pictured . Display: The device, which is being developed by a British firm, has already been shown off at police conferences in the US and UK . And three water cannon are likely to be purchased for use on the British mainland within months at a cost of more than £3m. Some senior officers believe the ‘acoustic distraction device’ could add another option to the police armoury. They believe it will be particularly useful to deter people who gather at riots but are not involved in the most serious violence and disorder. Its manufacturers also believe it could be used in prisons, to protect convoys and even as a distraction device in hostage situations. Shaped like an over-sized sci-fi gun, the yellow and black device can be strapped across the user’s chest and emits a ‘very intense’ sound beam. The specific wavelength of the beam fools the brain into thinking that the sound is much louder than it really is. Powerful: One of the unofficial guinea pigs said: 'It felt like there was something inside my head, I felt a bit nauseous, and all I wanted to do was get away from it' Officials believe the maximum safe exposure is 115 decibels, equal to a power saw or rock concert, over the period of a minute. The weapon comes with a laser sight, display indicating length of exposure and battery life and a video camera which records images of who it is used against. It is being developed by Cerberus Black, which named the weapon A-WASP, Acoustic Warning Signal Projector. The company was founded in 2009 to market and sell technology created by Cambridge University and a specialist acoustics firm. It has received funding from the Ministry of Defence, via its counter terrorism centre, and hope to begin selling devices within months. Officials at the Home Office’s Centre for Applied Science and Technology are preparing to test the sound gun. One senior member said: ‘It’s a very interesting innovation and one that we are looking forward to testing fully. ‘Anything that can help police disperse violent crowds without using traditional methods of force is of great interest to us.’ Matt Henry, of Cerberus Black, said the weapon can be used for crowd control and ‘conflict management’. He said it ‘sounds like the worst siren you've ever heard.’ He added: ‘It gives you an impression it's inside your head. ‘We are still developing it and the reason we are still getting feedback from the police. It’s not available for sale at the moment.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We constantly consider and review less lethal options which may be suitable for the police to use. ‘All equipment is subject to a rigorous testing and approval process including technical, medical and operational evaluations before it is considered for use.’","An acoustic warning signal projector is being developed by a UK firm .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Facing lawsuit: Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been accused of misleading investors about its financial health before its $16billion floatation . Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been told by a judge that he and dozens of banks must face a lawsuit accusing the social media company of misleading investors about its financial health before its $16billion floatation last year. In a decision made public on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in Manhattan said investors could pursue claims that Facebook concealed material information from its initial public offering (IPO) registration statement. Investors have alleged that Facebook . should have disclosed its internal projections on how increased mobile . usage and product decisions might reduce future revenues, among other . things. The defendants . argued that Facebook had no obligation to make the disclosures, which . they called immaterial, even though it had provided such projections to . its underwriters' analysts. It came as Mr Zuckerberg plans to sell 41.35 million 'B' shares in the company, worth about $2.3 billion, for tax purposes, according to a filing with US stock market regulators today. The shares will allow Zuckerberg to retain power over Facebook because each has 10 voting rights. Proceeds from the sale will allow the young billionaire to pay taxes due on the exercise of an option enabling him to obtain 60 million additional 'B' Facebook shares. Facebook shares, which have risen strongly in recent months, were down 4.1 per cent in pre-market trading, having closed at $55.57 on Wednesday. In an 83-page decision dated December 11, Sweet said higher mobile usage had already had a 'material negative' impact on revenue and that the company should have disclosed more about the relationship. 'The company's purported risk warnings misleadingly represented that this revenue cut was merely possible when, in fact, it had already materialised,' Sweet wrote. Claims: Investors have alleged that Facebook should have disclosed its internal projections on how increased mobile usage and product decisions might reduce future revenues . 'Plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded material misrepresentation(s) that could have and did mislead investors regarding the company's future and current revenues.' A spokeswoman for Menlo Park, California-based Facebook had no immediate comment. A lawyer for some of the investors did not immediately respond to requests for comment. On Monday, Sweet issued a decision that investors could also pursue claims accusing Nasdaq OMX Group Inc of concealing technology problems that led to difficulties in processing trades on May 18, 2012, Facebook's first day of trading. Sweet is overseeing nationwide litigation arising from the IPO. Facebook went public at $38 per share. Its share price rose as high as $45 on the first day, but quickly fell below the offering price and stayed there for more than a year. Facebook is now profitable, and is expected to join the Standard & Poor's 500 index after the close of trading on Friday.","Investors claim the company concealed information from its IPO statement .

"By . Richard Shears . On screen they are usually portrayed as mortal enemies, but a cat that was dying after eating rat poison was saved thanks to a blood transfusion - from a dog. The rare operation was carried out by New Zealand vet Kate Heller, who realised that Rory the cat would not survive unless he was given an immediate blood transfusion. Unfortunately his blood type was not known and to have performed the delicate operation with the wrong type of blood - which for cats falls into categories A, B or AB - could have proved fatal. Critical: Ginger tabby, Rory, similar to this one pictured here, was saved by a blood transfusion from a dog . But decisive action was imperative because without it Rory was in equal danger of using up the last of his nine lives. Rory's owner Kim Edwards rushed him to Tauranga Vets after she heard him howling in pain and unable to move. When she got there she found the blood laboratory was closed and it was not possible to determine Rory's . blood type. After consulting colleagues, Miss Heller decided to take a chance and perform the operation on the sick feline using dog's blood. She said: 'If . we didn't do it, he would have died, so we had nothing to lose by . giving it a go. It was a do or die, but it's very . uncommon.' Studies have shown that cats might . not have such an adverse reaction to it no matter what the type, than . they might to the wrong type of cat blood. Saviour: A black Labrador called Macy, similar to this one here, was responsible for donating the blood . Miss Heller, of Tauranga, told the Bay of Plenty Times: 'Inter-species blood transfusions are not common, nor are they recommended.' Miss Edwards called a friend from her book club who owns a pet Labrador called Macy. She agreed to letting her dog be used for the transfusion. According to Miss Heller, Rory had been 'really flat and . gasping and howling' before the operation. But the transfusion worked so well that an . hour after the transfusion he was purring and tucking into a bowl of . biscuits. Miss Edwards said: 'The vets just went above and beyond. It's . incredible that it worked. 'Rory is back to normal - and just for the record we don't have a cat that barks or fetch the paper!'","Vet performs rare operation on cat that was dying after eating rat poison .

"By . Liz  Hull . A woman made four increasingly desperate 999 calls after her husband became ill with chest pains, eventually telling the operator: ‘It’s too late now, he’s gone.’ Fred Pring, 74, died of heart failure while waiting almost an hour for an ambulance after paramedics initially refused to attend because they were due a break, an inquest heard yesterday. In a string of harrowing calls the retired gardener’s wife Joyce, 63, had begged the emergency service for help for her husband. Fred Pring, 74, pictured with wife Joyce, died at his home, near Mold, after the ambulance turned up late . By the time paramedics arrived more than 50 minutes after the first call it was too late. Delays in A&E meant paramedics had had to wait up to 99 minutes to hand over patients to hospital staff, and there were no ambulances available. When a crew was found they refused to attend because they were due a break. Only when Mrs Pring rang to say her husband had died and her 999 call was flagged at the most serious level did they agree to go to her aid. John Gittins, coroner for North East Wales, heard that the ambulance service was ‘extremely busy’ on the night Mr Pring died and their response was almost 45 minutes slower than the target time of eight minutes for life-threatening cases. Mrs Pring first called 999 just before 1.10am on March 21 last year after her husband (pictured) complained of chest pains at their home . The inquest was told by Mr Pring’s cardiologist, Raj Thaman, that he might have survived if paramedics had arrived soon after the first call, but by the time of the second it was unlikely he would have lived. Mrs Pring, a retired civil servant, first called 999 just before 1.10am on March 21 last year after her husband, who suffered from several serious conditions including heart failure, complained of chest pains at their home in Mynydd Isa, near Mold. The operator reassured Mrs Pring that an ambulance was on the way. Nine minutes later – at 1.19am – Mr Pring’s condition worsened and his wife called 999 again. Mr Pring could be heard groaning as his wife told the operator: ‘He’s in very severe pain, he’s having trouble breathing. I just want someone to help.’ Mrs Pring told the hearing: ‘I could see the panic in his face, the fear in his eyes. He kept saying: ‘‘Tell them to hurry up’’.’ In the third call, 19 minutes later at 1.38am, Mrs Pring told the operator: ‘I can’t make it any more urgent… I keep phoning back but nothing changes.’ Soon afterwards her husband stopped breathing and died, Mrs Pring told the hearing. ‘At 1.45am he said he couldn’t take any more,’ she said. ‘He said: ‘‘I’m going’’ and slumped back on the pillow, stopped breathing and just passed away.’ She called 999 for the final time, at 1.51am, telling the operator: ‘This is the fourth time I’ve rung for an ambulance, it’s too late now, he’s gone.’ Mrs Pring told the inquest at Ruthin, North Wales, that the female operator in the final call showed a ‘considerable’ lack of compassion. Ten minutes after the call three ambulances, two from the Welsh Ambulance Service and one from the North West Ambulance Service, arrived at the couple’s home. In a string of harrowing calls Mrs Pring, 63, had begged the emergency service for help for her husband . In a statement Michael Bennett, one of the first paramedics to arrive, said they had experienced ‘considerable delays’ at the A&E department of Wrexham Maelor Hospital on a previous call when they had waited 99 minutes to hand over a patient to staff. They left the hospital at 1.32am and received a ‘red two’ call – the second most serious – but had been on shift for six hours without a break, so ‘politely declined’ to help. Paramedics are supposed to receive a 30 minute break every three hours. A short time later Mr Bennett and a colleague got a ‘red one’ call, the most serious and agreed to forgo their break. The inquest continues. A statement released last night by Mrs Pring’s solicitor said she was ‘haunted’ by the 999 calls and was unable to listen to them in court, but she believes her husband was let down by a systemic failure and does not seek to blame any individual. Joyce Pring (pictured) begged the emergency services for help for her husband, Fred . Mrs Pring:  ‘It’s my fourth call, I think my husband has just died.’ Operator asks for her full address . Mrs Pring: ‘This is the fourth time I’ve rung for an ambulance, it’s too late now, he’s gone.’ Operator: ‘Are you with him now.’ Mrs Pring: ‘There’s not much point now, he’s dead.’ Operator: ‘How old is he?’ Mrs Pring:  ‘He was 74.’ Operator: ‘Is he awake?’ Mrs Pring: ‘No’ Operator: ‘Is he breathing?’ Mrs Pring: ‘No.’ Operator: ‘Alright, what happened?’ Mrs Pring; ‘He just couldn’t take the pain anymore and couldn’t breathe anymore.’ Operator: ‘Okay, I’m organising help for you now.’ Mrs Pring: ‘There’s nothing I can do now for him, he’s just lying on the bed.’ Operator urges Mrs Pring to help her husband by laying him flat on his back on the floor. Mrs Pring: ‘I can’t do that, there’s nobody here, he’s died.’ Operator:  ‘Are there any neighbours that can help you?’ Mrs Pring: ‘No, there’s nothing I can do, he’s dead.’ Operator: ‘I can tell you how to help him.’ Mrs Pring: ‘You’re too late, I’m sorry.’ Operator: ‘Are you wanting to help your husband? Mrs Pring: ‘Just let him go. He was in pain, I do not want him to suffer. It’s not that I do not want to help him, he’s gone.’ Operator: ‘Let’s help him together.’ Mrs Pring: ‘I can’t he’s gone. Don’t you understand? I don’t want to get him back to suffer more.’ Operator: ‘When did he stop breathing?' Mrs Pring: ‘Two minutes ago.’ Operator: ‘Just follow my instructions, you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do.’ Mrs Pring: ‘I just want someone to come and take him, it’s nearly an hour…What are your target times?’ Operator: ‘What do you mean…we try to get to patients as quickly as possible.’ Mrs Pring: ‘Well, you haven’t succeeded this time.’","Fred Pring died of heart failure waiting almost an hour for an ambulance .

"By . Michael Seamark . The mother of a gifted young ballerina who threw herself under a train demanded action yesterday against the ‘toxic digital world’ of the internet that glamorises suicide and self-harm. Tallulah Wilson, 15, had been hooked on photo-sharing websites, where users encouraged her to harm herself. The privately-educated schoolgirl – who had created a fantasy cocaine-taking online character – killed herself at London’s St Pancras station in October 2012. Talented: Tallulah Wilson was a promising dancer who had been 'headhunted' by the Royal Ballet . Yesterday, after the inquest into her . death ended, her mother Sarah Wilson issued a statement urging websites . to do more to protect vulnerable youngsters. She . asked companies to withdraw advertising from those sites which . ‘continue to host inappropriate self-harming and suicide-promoting . blogs’ to ‘stop this poison spreading’. Mrs . Wilson said she was horrified when she discovered pictures of her . daughter self-harming on the blogging website, Tumblr, and the family . had tried to protect her. ‘We have lost someone more precious than words . could ever say – a beautiful, loving and talented shining star has been . stolen from our skies,’ she said. ‘Her sisters and I did everything we could to keep her safe, but she had fallen into a world of nightmares. ‘She was in the clutches of a toxic digital world where in the final few weeks we could no longer reach her.’ Mrs . Wilson, who had desperately tried to keep her troubled daughter off the . websites, added: ‘I was shocked by the ease with which Tallulah and . other children can access online self-harm blogs. ‘Tallulah . entered a world where the lines between fantasy and reality became . blurred. It is every parent’s worst nightmare. Torment: The teenager moved from St Marylebone School in Westminster after 'bullying' claims . 'I believe the likes of . Tumblr should do more to protect other vulnerable young people from the . insidious aspects of the internet; they need to take an active role in . policing and swiftly removing unsuitable material as some sites already . do.’ Tallulah, the youngest . of three girls whose parents are divorced, lived with her family in a . £1million house in West Hampstead, North-West London. She had a bright . future and had been head-hunted by the Royal Ballet School. St . Pancras Coroner Mary Hassell said she would write a ‘prevention of . further death report’ for the Department of Health and other government . agencies after the inquest jury highlighted the need for a ‘better . understanding’ of online media. The jury delivered a narrative verdict. During . the inquest, Miss Hassell described two sides of Tallulah. One was a . talented horse rider and a ‘confident, lively, engaged, lovely-looking . girl’, the other was a troubled teenager who suffered from . self-loathing. The inquest . heard she had become addicted to the internet and created a fantasy . character to escape reality but she ‘spiralled out of control’ and . became obsessed with her online persona. Days . before Tallulah’s death, her mother found out that she had created the . online persona and gained 18,000 followers after posting about drinking . and taking cocaine and uploading pictures of herself with cuts she had . made in order to impress her fans. New school: Tallulah moved to £11,000-a-year St Margaret's School in Hampstead a month before her death . Tribute: The mother of Tallulah Wilson, who died in 2012, has spoken of her grief at losing her 'beautiful shining star' Mrs . Wilson wept as she told the court: ‘She didn’t think she could have . friends in the real world. I told her it wasn’t real. It was scary.’ Of . the images on Tumblr, Mrs Wilson told the inquest: ‘It was pictures of . her cutting herself. It’s like the worst horror movie you have ever seen . in your house. ‘I realised . there were young girls on there cutting themselves to see who is worse. It’s unbelievable. I saw one girl post a picture with a noose, and the . picture said, “Here’s your new necklace, try it on”.’ The inquest heard claims that Tallulah . had been bullied at St Marylebone School in Westminster, which she . attended until summer 2012. In September she started at £11,000-a-year . St Margaret’s School in Hampstead. By this time she had become addicted . to the websites, her mother said. The . teenager – who was diagnosed with clinical depression – had regularly . posted troubling messages on Twitter, including; ‘I will never be . beautiful and skinny’ and ‘I have absolutely no plan for my future’. One of her final messages was: ‘Why the f*** should I stay if no one around me stays for me? I’m done. #suicide #goodbye.’ A . spokesman for Tumblr said last night that ‘issues of depression and . self-harm are extremely challenging, particularly in online environments . that encourage  self-expression’. He added that the site has policies . to address harmful content and is committed to improving its ability to . act on  self-harm content. Martyn . Piper, whose 17-year-old son Tim killed himself in 2002 after searching . online for information on suicide, is vice-chairman of Papyrus, a . charity that works to prevent youth suicides. He said: ‘We believe there . is no place for such sites and forums. At the very least they must be . brought within the regulatory processes seeking to tackle other internet . dangers, such as sexualisation of children and pornography.’ For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org.","Tallulah Wilson threw herself in front of a train after posting images online .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A handful of history buffs and curious onlookers watched today as a . bulldozer tore through the walls of a dilapidated apartment building . where Lee Harvey Oswald lived a few months before the assassination of . President John F. Kennedy. The uninhabited 10-unit, two-story apartment complex built in 1925 . was one of several remaining places tied to Kennedy's Nov. 22, 1963, . assassination, which remains perhaps the most infamous moment in Dallas . history. Oswald lived at the building at 600 Elsbeth St. with his wife, . Marina, and young daughter from November 1962 to March 1963. The residence is mentioned in the Warren Commission report that investigated Kennedy's death and concluded Oswald acted alone. It's history: The Dallas apartment building where Lee Harvey Oswald lived shortly before President Kennedy was assassinated is demolished today. The bulldozer ramming through the walls started with the side where . Oswald lived. Police blocked off Elsbeth Street and the sidewalk in . front, but let onlookers grab bricks from the side of the building. Last seconds: Bulldozer is set to smash into Oswald's former Dallas home . Tom Sclar, a local resident and musician, put five bricks in a . backpack as souvenirs and possibly sale items later. Sclar said the . building was included on tours he once gave to groups interested in the . many alternate theories about Kennedy's death. ""People sell this crap for money,"" Sclar said. ""I'm doing it out of a weird, kitschy interest."" Collector's item: Tom Sclar gathers bricks . Jose Sorola said he was fascinated by the history of two presidential . assassins — Oswald and John Wilkes Booth, who killed Abraham Lincoln. Sorola had heard about the upcoming demolition on the news and . eventually purchased an apartment window for $125 online. His goal, he . said, was to build a ""traveling wall"" around the window so it could be . displayed to others. ""He still lived here, and in my opinion, he's a part of Dallas . history,"" Sorola said. ""Maybe for the wrong reason, but he's still a . part of history."" Kennedy's assassination still generates plenty of controversy, . particularly as theories still circulate about whether Oswald acted . alone. President Kennedy's nephew, Robert Kennedy Jr., said over the weekend that he believes a second gunman was involved and that his father, Robert Kennedy, who was Attorney General at the time, was privately dismissive of the Warren Commission. That report says Oswald shot Kennedy from the . sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository building — now a museum . dedicated to Kennedy and the assassination. The Warren Commission also . concluded that Oswald killed Dallas police officer J.D. Tippit 45 . minutes after Kennedy was shot. Oswald was arrested in the hours after the assassination, but was killed two days later by nightclub owner Jack Ruby. Gary Mack, curator of the Sixth Floor Museum, said Oswald ordered the . revolver that killed Tippit in January 1963, when Oswald was living at . the Elsbeth Street apartment. But, he added, ""The most important parts . of the Oswald story are what he did, not where he did them."" Jane Bryant bought the apartment building in 2007 but was never able . to realize plans to renovate it. The city got a court order last May to . have it razed and took over demolition when Bryant failed to act quickly . enough. The city estimated demolition and asbestos abatement would run about . $52,000 and said it may put a lien on the property to recover its costs. Preparation: Construction crews readied the house for demolition . Keep away: A city worker cuts a chain link fence surrounding the apartment complex prior to demolition . Bryant was emotional about seeing the building being demolished. She previously told the LA Times that she hadn't known that the process had begun until she was informed by a reporter. 'The city of Dallas told me if I was . making progress on the building, they would stop it,' Bryant said. 'They agreed to give me more time.' The owner had been trying to salvage the valuable and historic parts of the building that was built in 1925. She believed she had around two weeks left. Bryant has already sold the toilet and bathtub from Oswald's old apartment but wanted to remove the old pine and white oak from the property. Crumbling: The disheveled apartment was uninhabited and had a number of building code violations. She told the LA . Times that she was trying to contact her lawyer to file a restraining . order to stop the demolition, and that police on Monday had refused to . let her into the building. 'We're not just losing a piece . of fundamental history to Dallas related to the assassination, we're . also losing a piece of fundamental architecture to this area,' said . Bryant. Abandoned: No one has lived in the run-down home for several years . Evil lived here: Oswald resided in apartment number 2. The building's owner has sold off a number of things from his home, including the toilet . David . Preziosi, executive director of Preservation Dallas, noted that there . are more important buildings associated with Oswald than the Elsbeth . Street apartment, including the boarding house where he was staying the . day of the assassination and the Texas Theatre, where Oswald was . arrested. After leaving the Elsbeth Street . apartment, Oswald moved a few blocks away, to Neely Street - where the . famous pictures were taken of him posing in the backyard holding the . rifle used in the assassination. He was living at a boarding house in . the same area but on Beckley Avenue when Kennedy was assassinated. Swept away: A police officer and a worker prepare to tear down the historic building . Gone: The owner said that by demolishing the apartment, they are losing a piece of history . Bryant didn't know . of the site's link to history until the year after she bought it. After a . local television station did a piece the building she had dreams of . renovating, people got in contact to let her know of the Oswald . connection. She notes that the building has . been a point of interest, adding that she'd had tourists from overseas . come by the complex on Thanksgiving.

"By . James Chapman . Attack: Ed Miliband will accuse firms of targeting vulnerable families and causing misery for millions . David Cameron was under increasing pressure to  stop the spread of fixed-odds betting terminals last night. Labour leader Ed Miliband announced plans to give councils the power to ban the gambling machines, which have been dubbed the ‘crack cocaine of the high street’. Mr Miliband admitted Labour, which allowed the creation of the machines in the 2005 Gambling Act, had ‘changed our mind’, following widespread concern that the machines are addictive for problem gamblers. Bookmakers now rake in more than £1billion a year in profits from the machines, which allow punters to gamble up to £300 a minute, or £18,000 an hour, mostly on electronic roulette. Mr Miliband said he would legislate to put betting shops in a separate planning class so that councils can control the number opening in their area. That plan has already been backed by the Liberal Democrats at their party conference. Currently betting shops are classified as ‘financial and professional services’, which means that one can open in any building that used to be a bank, building society, estate agent or employment agency without needing planning permission. Labour would also legislate to give councils the power to revoke or reduce the number of FOBTs in betting shops, currently capped at four, potentially to zero. Finally, the party says it would legislate to increase the time between plays, curtrently once every 20 seconds, requiring on screen warnings and breaks in play. Industry: Fixed odds betting temrinals (FOBTs) make more than £1billion a year in Britain . Mr Miliband said: ‘There’s clearly a massive and growing epidemic in some parts of our country of people losing huge amounts of money on these fixed odds betting machines. Our high streets are turning into high stakes, high cost venues for gambling. ‘I’m not objecting to having a betting shop or two on my high street but I don’t think people want the high street to be full of betting shops. ‘It’s right that we stand up to a powerful and important industry, the gambling industry. The betting industry has its place in the country but we can’t let them dominate our decisions.’ David Cameron has expressed concern about the issue but the Department for Culture has delayed any action while a review of betting habits on gambling machines is conducted - due to report back in the autumn. Campaign: Miliband is backed by Labour MPs including Tom Watson (pictured) in a policy break from New Labour, which attempted to allow 'super casinos' Mr Miliband accused the Government of failing to act. ‘They . seem incredibly reluctant to act. I want to force them to act. I’d . rather they acted now rather than wait 18 months. They’re too slow. They . should stand up to the vested interests. Mr Miliband conceded that Labour’s gambling policy from 2005 has proved problematic. ‘We’ve changed our approach on the basis of the evidence. Tuition fee repeat? Nick Clegg has been accused of going against his word after voting against curbs on betting terminals this month . In . 2007/8 when the supercasinos were stopped people thought that was the . big issue, actually this turned out to be as important an issue and it . needs to be dealt with. We’re responding to the evidence, which is concerning and worrying. Something needs to be done.’ Mr . Miliband will stop short of agreeing with one key demand of campaigners . against the proliferation of the machines, which is for the maximum . stake to be slashed to £2 per spin. But he told the Mail: ‘We don’t rule that out. We don’t rule out going further.’ The . Tories accused Labour of hypocrisy for accepting hundreds of thousands . of pounds in donations from top gambling figures, including Peter Coates . of Bet365 and industry lobbyist Neil Goulden, the former boss of the . Association of British Bookmakers. In . total, Labour have received £192,000 of cash from Goulden and Coates- . with some of the donations being registered only months ago. Two key members of his Shadow Cabinet, Tristram Hunt and Chuka Umunna, have also pocketed cash directly from gambling tycoons. But . Mr Miliband said his policy would not be affected by the donations. ‘There are people who are Labour supporters in all walks of life, . whether they’re Labour supporters or not we’ll do the right thing for . the country.’ Derek Webb, . Founder of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling and Stop the FOBTs Campaign, . said: ‘We welcome this announcement and look forward to the national . debate that now looks set to take place. The Coalition can’t continue to . delay action on FOBTs any longer.’ The . Association of British Bookmakers condemned the plans. A spokesman . said: ‘This announcement has nothing to do with helping problem . gamblers; it is simply about playing politics with the jobs of 40,000 . people, and the enjoyment of 8 million customers for no reason.’ David . Cameron has expressed concern about the issue but the Department for . Culture has delayed any action while a review of betting habits on . gambling machines is conducted. It is due to report back in the autumn.","Labour leader to accuse firms of causing 'misery' for millions of families .

"By . Ashley Collman . A millionaire tech CEO accused of beating up a former reality star at the Sundance Film Festival was booked in Summit County Jail Tuesday. Patrick Henry was charged with assault, damage of a communication device and criminal mischief after allegedly beating up reality-star Ariane Bellamar at the film festival in January. If convicted, the CEO of San Diego-based Entropic Communications could end up behind bars for a year. Henry was released after being booked. Arrested: Entropic Communications CEO Patrick Henry was booked this week on charges he beat up reality-star Ariane Bellamar (right) on a trip to the Sundance Film Festival in January . The trip to the festival was supposed to be a romantic getaway for Beverly Hills Nannies star Bellamar and Henry, but she claims he beat her up in a jealous, booze-fueled rage on their second-night in Park City, Utah. Evidence: Bellamar took several pictures of her bruised and battered body after the alleged attack . 'The charges relate to allegations that on January 23, Mr Henry assaulted Ariane Bellamar. It is further alleged that when Ms Bellamar attempted to call 911, Mr Henry took her cell phone and threw it on the ground, damaging the phone's screen,' a statement from the Summit County Sheriff's Office read. She has also released pictures of bruises on her body she claims proves she was attacked. However, his lawyers told RadarOnline that he is innocent and that Ms Bellamar was ‘intoxicated’ on the night of the alleged attack. A spokesperson for Henry said: ‘The statements made by Ms Bellamar are not consistent with the facts. Mr Henry did not attack or assault her. ‘Ms Bellamar had been drinking heavily and was intoxicated before dinner; she continued to drink during and after dinner. We are confident that when the facts come out, they will validate that Mr. Henry neither attacked nor assaulted her.’ Bellamar says she met the 51-year-old online through dating website MillionaireMatch.com after officially separating from her real estate mogul husband Barry Pettitt in November. Though she never met Henry in person . person before the trip, she agreed to go because 'he seemed normal' and . friends vouched for him. She . seemed to be having a great time when she posted a picture of the view . from Utah on January 22. 'Park City is amazing!' she wrote. But things allegedly took a turn for the worse on their second night out. 'He started doing shots...and became . very jealous of the attention his friends were paying me,' Bellamar told . Radar. 'I told him I wanted to leave [but] he did not. I took a cab . back to the cabin, inadvertently locked the door behind me and went to . bed.' Looking for love: Bellamar says she met Henry on dating site MillionaireMatch.com, and that the two had not met in person before she agreed to be his date to Sundance . Happy start: On January 22, Bellamar posted a picture from Park City on her Facebook page. She says she agreed to go to the film festival with Henry even though she never met him in person . The next thing she . says she remembers is being woken up by Henry, dragging her by the hair . into the garage. She claims he screamed at her and accused her of . purposefully locking him out even though he had a key. 'He . then proceeded to throw me multiple times into the concrete walls of . the garage,' she said. 'I am bloodied and bruised all up and down my . left side of my body and… right side. It was terrifying.' Bellamar . provided pictures of her injuries to Radar which show bruises covering . her left arm, thigh and backside with scabs on her hands and broken . nails. Abused: After returning from Utah, Bellamar went to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a 'stress reaction to a recent assault' 'After three tosses, . I just laid freezing on the garage floor, begging him to allow me into . the house ,' Bellamar said. 'I thought that I was going to freeze to . death. I was still in my cocktail attire from the evening. He looked . crazy.' Rich man: Henry is the Millionaire CEO of San Diego-based Entropic Communications. He met Bellamar on MillionaireMatch.com . 'As I was laying . bloody on his garage floor, I thought “Oh my God, I’m going to die . here.” This is what you see on TV. I am not that person,' she added to . MailOnline. Eventually Henry . agreed to let her back in, and Bellamar says she then went to sit on . the couch where she started crying, curled up in the fetal position. Henry allegedly yelled at her to stop crying, picking her up and throwing her back into bed. Bellamar continued to cry and shake 'uncontrollably', prompting Henry to rip off the covers and tell her to leave. Bellamar says she was in so much pain and shock, she didn't even respond so Henry called the police saying she wouldn't leave, she claimed. She said the experience has been 'traumatizing' and that she cannot understand the domestic abuse 'as a woman or as a mother'. Four days after posting the picture from Henry's Park City home, she wrote a somber status on Facebook. 'Brutality . against women never goes unpunished - never. You can run and/or try to . hide, but it will catch up with you - always ... xo Peace Over . Violence.' Took a turn: But just four days later she posted a more ominous message on her Facebook . Back in her home . of Santa Barbara, Bellamar went to the hospital where discharge records . show she was diagnosed with a 'stress reation to a recent assault' and . that she suffered 'multiple strain, contusions and abrasions' including . hand and shoulder sprains. After receiving requests for comment from Radar, Henry sent Bellamar two text messages. First . he wrote: 'I got an email from RadarOnline about the incident at my . home in Utah last week. I plan to ignore the inquiry. If you want to . discuss, please let me know. As far as I'm concerned it is private. Let . me know your thoughts. I can forward the email if you want.' A . few hours later, he sent yet another text: 'Keep in mind if you . publicly disparage me, I will reveal the facts of the situation in . defense of myself.' MailOnline asked Henry's company for comment, but has not received a reply. Following the alleged attack, Bellamar is having trouble sleeping at night and has started seeing a therapist. She says her husband has been 'extraordinarily supportive' despite their separation. Another challenge is explaining her injuries to her 5-year-old daughter. 'I . tell her you’ve got to be careful about who you’re around and not to . talk to strangers. At my age, I should have listened to my own advice,' she said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . He may never have been destined for the dinner table, but that doesn’t make Bernard’s story of survival any less remarkable. For this pet turkey, it was a greedy fox rather than a hungry human that sparked a chain of events that would put his life in jeopardy. Bernard went missing for ten days after being snatched by the fox, leaving owner Ellie Waite, 32, fearing the worst. Reunited: Bernard and his owner Ellie Waite, 32, after the turkey went through his death-defying journey . Mrs Waite, 32, and her son Ben, ten, found a trail of blood and feathers in their garden at East Ruston near North Walsham, Norfolk. Her husband Russell, 39, searched nearby fields and hedgerows in vain for Bernard, a Norfolk black turkey weighing 15lbs, before giving him up for dead. But unknown to them, Bernard had escaped from the fox and turned up battered on the doorstep of a woman who lives half a mile away. She fed him corn and table scraps and let him sleep in her garage at night until she returned from work four days later to find he had wandered off from her garden. Bernard was strutting around on his own when he was attacked again by a border terrier which was out for a walk. The male owner of the dog managed to prise Bernard free from his dog's jaws and took his pet home. He then returned to pick up Bernard and took him to a friend who lives five miles away in Happisburgh, so she could look after him as she already had ducks and chickens. Meanwhile Mrs Waite heard from other her next door neighbour how Bernard was being looked after by the woman who lives half a mile away from her. But when she tracked her down, she found out that he had gone. Mrs Waite said 'The lovely lady had been caring for him, putting him in her garage at night and letting him in her garden during the day. 'But when she returned from work one evening Bernard had gone without a trace. My heart sank, I was too late.' Survivor: Bernard was attacked by a fox and later a dog, but lived to cluck another day . Mrs Waite then launched a Facebook campaign to try and find Bernard her pet led her to the family in Happisburgh just two hours later. She said: 'To my utter amazement I got a message from someone who had seen my cry for help. She said: ""I think I have got your turkey here."" 'After nearly falling through the floor I made contact with the lady who was actually in Happisburgh, about five miles away. 'He is now back safely with us after his amazing adventure. He must be the luckiest turkey in the world. 'He is fortunate enough to be a much-loved pet at a time when millions of other turkeys end up being eaten for Christmas. 'But then he also survived being snatched by a fox and attacked by a dog. He is just indestructible.' Mrs Waite who runs Springfield dog kennels with her husband in East Ruston said that Bernard had been roosting seven feet up a tree in her garden when he was grabbed by the fox. She said: 'I thought he was safe in his tree, but somehow this fox nabbed him. It looked liked a fox was claiming his Christmas lunch early. 'We knew it had to be a fox because of all the feathers and the blood that we found in the garden the next morning. Home: Bernard was eventually returned to Mrs Waite's garden after a Facebook campaign reunited him and his family . 'We looked around but found no sign of him so we thought it was certain that he had been taken away and eaten. 'We also heard that a fox had taken one of our neighbour's chickens. It was horrendous - we were in mourning. 'Apparently when he turned up on this woman's doorstep, he had a bad cut on his breast and his wing was bleeding, so somehow he must have fought back against the fox and got away. 'When we got him back, he had also lost a lot of flight feathers and had a scar under his wing. We do not know how much damage was done by the fox and how much by the dog. 'His wounds are healing up nicely now, but he cannot fly at the moment because his feathers are missing which I suppose is quite a good thing. 'It means he cannot get back into his tree to roost so we are locking him up at night with our ducks in our children's wendy house so he is safe.' Mrs Waite added: 'When he was missing, my father was telling me that there was no way we would get him back as anyone who found him would keep him for a free Christmas dinner. 'He is such a character and it is great to have him back. He is part of the family and loves playing with our four dogs. 'He watches us eat through the conservatory window so there's no way I could eat turkey with him watching. 'We'll have ham this year. I think turkey is definitely off the menu for the foreseeable future.'","Ellie Waite, 32, thought her turkey had died after he disappeared for ten days .

"By . Ralph Ellis . Ralph Ellis runs you through what we learned from the weekend's football... with relief in East London and a look through the leagues, too. This week includes Carlton Cole's contract situation, James Milner's important (if short) role at Manchester City and Tim Sherwood's first call at Spurs may be his best. 1) Carlton Cole’s short-term contract at West Ham runs out this month and Hammers are talking to him about a new deal. But if the 30-year-old chooses not to play second fiddle to Andy Carroll now the £17million man is close to being fit he’s done a good job of putting himself in the shop window for other clubs. His goal at Cardiff meant he has scored on both of his Premier League starts – and his four goals in all have come at a rate of one every 99 minutes. Come and get me: Cole may find himself out of favour at West Ham when Carroll fully returns . Milner gets the job done . 2) James Milner has become the go-to man for Manchester City when you need to hang on to a lead. Manuel Pellegrini turned to him for the final 11 minutes at Newcastle, and he kept the ball superbly with 11 of 12 passes finding a team-mate – including the one that set up Alvaro Negredo’s goal that clinched the 2-0 win. His pass completion rate has been better than 90 per cent in eight of the 13 times he’s come off the bench this season. Solid: Milner has been Manchester City's Mr Reliable this season in all competitions . 3) In the days of extravagant squad numbers, Burnley might be heading to the Premier League with a delightfully traditional look about them. Sean Dyche’s side which won 2-1 at Yeovil were the only one of the 90 clubs to play so far this weekend fielding a goalkeeper and back four wearing shirts from one to five. For good measure prolific front pair Sam Vokes and Danny Ings are nine and 10, and for a few minutes after substitute Junior Stanislas replaced Keith Treacy, only two of their outfield players were wearing numbers higher than 11. Number game: Burnley might be heading to the Premier League with a delightfully traditional look about them . Bentaleb is making Spurs tick . 4) One of the first things Tim Sherwood did when he was promoted to take charge of Spurs was push teenager Nabil Bentaleb into the first team. The French-born 19-year-old, who has spent three years at Tottenham’s academy after being let go by Lille, has grabbed the chance. He made Tottenham tick against Palace, and his 99 accurate passes from 106 attempts has only been bettered by six midfield men in the Premier League all season. Prospect: Bentaleb was a handful against Crystal Palace on Saturday and is getting attention in the top flight . 5) If the Premier League is supposed to be no place for old men, then Fulham must be in even more danger of relegation than their 4-1 thumping at home by Sunderland would suggest. Of Rene Meulensteen’s starting line-up at Craven Cottage, only Adel Taarabt was under 28 – and the average age was 30 years and two months. Experienced or ageing? Only one player in Rene Meulensteen's starting XI was under 28 - Adel Taarabt . Mourinho helps Hodgson? 6) Roy Hodgson is constantly worried about how few of his potential World Cup stars get regular Premier League football. So Jose Mourinho’s decision to move David Luiz into Chelsea’s midfield in the 2-0 win at Hull looks like good news for the England manager. It means his first choice centre half Gary Cahill, on the bench for a third of his club’s games this season when the Brazilian has partnered John Terry, now looks to have made his own the place alongside the former England skipper. Cemented: Cahill seemingly now has his own place in the Chelsea defence, which can only be good for England . 7) Not the least of Stuart Gray’s achievements since taking temporary control of Sheffield Wednesday has been to help one-time England starlet Connor Wickham to rediscover his form. The 20-year-old, whose career has stalled since his £8million move to Sunderland in June 2011, got his eighth goal in ten games on loan at Hillsborough to contribute to the 6-0 annihilation of hapless Leeds. Six of them have been since Gray took charge, but he will have to make the most of it.  Wickham’s extended loan deal must end on January 29. Loanee: Eight goals in ten games has made every sit up and take notice of Conor Wickham again . Ranger will test Cooper . 8) Swindon’s young manager Mark Cooper is getting some good lessons on managing a maverick talent, thanks to the club’s decision to give a chance to former Newcastle striker Nile Ranger. The Robins were ready to kick him out after the troubled 22-year-old went AWOL from training. Cooper got his players to vote on whether they would accept an apology  - and the ‘yes’ decision was rewarded when he scored the first in a 2-1 win over promotion rivals Peterborough. Cooper said: ‘The players decided we were a better team with him than without.’ Tricky one: Ranger has a troubled past, and is sure to test Mark Cooper's management skills . 9) Morecambe, two points off the play-off places in League Two, have been punching above their weight and that’s mainly because of a never-say-die spirit. Jim Bentley’s team rescued a point against Wycombe with a late goal by Kevin Ellison – meaning they have now rescued 21 of their 37 points this season from games in which they were losing. 10) The last thing either second placed Cambridge United or leaders Luton need in the race to earn automatic promotion from the Skrill Premier League is extra games. Neither manager would have been too happy, then, when second half goals from Tom Elliott and Ashley Chambers forced a replay in the FA Trophy clash between the clubs after Luton had led 2-0. The game drew a crowd of 3,194 incidentally – bigger than four of the 12 gates in League Two. Build up: Luton will have to play an extra game having drawn 2-2 with Cambridge United in the FA Trophy .","West Ham striker Carlton Cole is putting himself in the shop window .

"By . Simon Jones . Click here for all the latest news . Manchester United are growing increasingly confident they can persuade Borussia Dortmund's Ilkay Gundogan to join them in the summer. The 23-year-old's father Irfan has held talks with Dortmund, Real Madrid and Barcelona while Arsenal and Chelsea have also shown an interest. Gundogan, who has been out or five months with an injured vertebrae, is contracted to the German club until 2015 but has a release clause of around £23million. United have also been pressing for a deal with his team-mate Marco Reus but Dortmund have been reluctant to sell yet another star following Mario Gotze's departure to Bayern Munich last summer and Robert Lewandowski's pending move to the same club. VIDEO  Scroll down to watch Man United target Ilkay Gundogan scoring a cracker . Summer move? Man United are confident Borussia Dortmund's Ilkay Gundogan will join them . In demand: Gundogan's father Irfan has been talking to Real Madrid and Barcelona about his son's future . Release: Gundogan's Dortmund contract expires in 2015 and he has a £23million release clause . The Germans have not given up hope of keeping their squad intact but summer would allow everyone better time to rebuild. Gundogan knows he would get regular first-team football at United, while at Real Madrid the central midfield area is fiercely contested. At Barcelona, they are looking for a replacement for Xavi, 33, who has clocked up 700 games and is troubled by ongoing Achilles problems but still intends to play for at least another season. Dortmund are in a training camp at La Manga in Spain and intend to add a defender and striker of their own, preferably in this window. Inter Milan's Andrea Ranocchia, a former Manchester City target, is Jurgen Klopp's preference at the back. Multiple moves: Ji Dong-won has left Sunderland for Augsburg and will sign for Dortmund this summer . Sunderland striker Ji Dong-won signed for Augsburg yesterday in a £500,000 deal but the South Korea man is merely taking a detour to Dortmund, as revealed on MailOnline. The 22-year-old played for Augsburg on loan in the first half of last year and helped them avoid relegation and has joined them until the end of the season. He will then sign a four-year contract at Dortmund in the summer, and BVB sporting director Michael Zorc said: 'We are delighted that we can sign this talented player on a free for next season.' Sunderland rejected a £5m offer from the Champions League runners-up last summer. Losing hope: The chances of Wayne Rooney renewing his contract at Man United decreases by the day . Man Utd are continuing to look for a striker, too, with Wayne Rooney's contract situation looking bleak and Robin van Persie struggling for fitness. The Dutchman has been doing gym work at Carrington this week but is back in Holland today for a check-up with his trusted fitness coach Arno Philips at PSV Eindhoven. Diego Costa, Edinson Cavani and Radamel Falcao remain in United's thinking for the summer although they will face competition from Chelsea for all three. Which soon-to-be-former Premier League player, who struggles with his . weight, was caught out when his manager's daughter bumped into him as he . struggled with the door at his local KFC? He was armed with a 'Wicked . Zinger' and 'Boneless Banquet' just two days after being told that his . body fat needed to come down. Another Diego, De Girolamo could add an extra dimension to the Yorkshire derby between Sheffield United and Bradford City tomorrow. The 18-year-old, born and bred in Chesterfield, is hoping to be in Nigel Clough's first-team squad after 10 months out with a cruciate ligament injury. The teenager, who was being closely monitored by Arsenal, Man Utd and City, caused a stir in 2012 when he opted to play for Italy U18s instead of England after receiving a personal call from the great AC Milan and Italy coach Arrigo Sacchi. Diego qualified for Italy through his father Cosimo who is from Naples. He played six games for Italy U18s and scored three goals only to rupture his anterior cruciate in the last minute of a friendly against Austria. Wanted man: Both Man United and Man City are tracking Sheffield United's striker Diego De Girolamo . A 10-month recovery ensued but he returned to play an hour for Sheffield United's U21s against Stoke earlier this month before a run out against Coventry U18s last week. He scored two goals in 13 minutes before over extending his knee and coming off as a precaution. However, he has been training with Sheffield United's first-team squad and is hoping for a place on the bench against Bradford with an eye on facing Fulham in the FA Cup also. Liverpool and Everton, alerted by his return to fitness, are also due to send scouts to watch De Girolamo. He is still eligible to play for England but Italy have not forgotten him and invited him to an U19 squad camp in Florence just before Christmas. On his way out? Inter Milan are said to be showing an interest in signing Southampton's Pablo Osvaldo . Target: Roma have shown an interest in signing Southampton's Gaston Ramirez . The future of Luke Shaw seems to lie in a blue shirt as interest gathers in the Southampton defender, but his team-mates Gaston Ramirez and Pablo Osvaldo could be making a quicker exit out of St Mary's. Both players' representatives were over this week and they are keen on a return to Italy. Roma are among the frontrunners for Uruguayan Ramirez, while Inter remain favourites for Osvaldo. Southampton chairman Katharina Liebherr says no players will be leaving but both may push for Serie A returns in the coming days.","Manchester United are confident that Borussia Dortmund's Ilkay Gundogan will join them this summer .

"By . Chris Pleasance . With its distinctive logo, endless merchandise and famous mansion in LA, it is almost impossible to remember a time when Playboy didn't exist. In fact it is almost exactly sixty years since a man by the name of Hugh Hefner quit his job at Esquire magazine after being denied a $5 pay rise and set about creating a world publishing icon on his kitchen table in Chicago. Yesterday in LA that magazine celebrated its 60th anniversary with 60 bunnies touring around the city in an open topped bus with the ageing Hefner, now 87, posing for pictures with them. Scroll down for video . Hugh Hefner, the founder of Playboy , has celebrated the magazine's 60th anniversary with 60 of his bunnies in Los Angeles, California . In 1953 the publication launched its first issue which sold 53,000 copies, becoming an instant hit. By 1966 (pictured) Hefner had gained both fame and notoriety . The 60th anniversary issue of the magazine, published last month, featured Kate Moss on the cover . Hefner, now 87, founded the magazine with $600 of his own money and $8,000 from 45 other investors - including $1,000 from his own mother . In the glorious Californian sunshine the bunnies, which included Hefner's daughter Christie, and several former Playmates Of The Year, celebrated the special event at Playboy World Headquarters. Speaking at the launch of the 60th anniversary magazine, which featured Kate Moss on the front cover, Hefner said: 'Sixty years ago, I created Playboy magazine with an intent to reflect on and influence the cultural changes taking place in America, as well as to become the voice of sophisticated men all over the world. 'From its beginning, Playboy has stood for freedom of speech, freedom of choice and freedom of the press. 'I am so proud to celebrate this anniversary as the magazine continues its mission to promote these core values many decades later.' In 1953, aged in his mid-20s, Hefner used $600 of his own money, and another $8,000 from 45 investors - including $1,000 from his mother - to publish the first edition of Playboy. It appeared on December 1 1953, cost 50 cent, featured a black and white picture of a fully dressed Marilyn Monroe on the cover and promised full colour nude pictures inside. It sold 53,000 copies, becoming an instant hit. The 60 bunnies toured on an open top bus through LA's Beverley Hills neighbourhood as part of the magazine's year-long 60th anniversary celebrations . When the magazine launched it cost 50 cents and featured a black and white photo of a fully-dressed Marilyn Monroe on the front - with the promise of nude color pictures inside . The magazine, which has been in decline for several years, enjoyed its peak circulation in the 1970s, selling 7milliion copies every month . Two years later, in 1955, the magazine featured the first bikini shot on its front page, as playmate of the month Janet Pilgrim posed face-down on a towel on the front. The magazine has always courted controversy, from modern-day campaigns against presenting women as sexual objects, to a court case in 1963 during which Hefner was accused of publishing obscene material. He stood in his own defence, arguing that the difference between art and pornography was an issue for individual taste and not the courts. The jury came back with a split verdict, and the case was thrown as a mistrial. The magazine has always courted controversy, from modern-day protests that it objectifies women, to a court case in 1963 during which Hefner was accused of publishing obscene material . During the case Hefner stood in his own defence, and eventually the case was thrown out as a mistrial after he argued that the difference between obscenity and art was a matter for individual taste . Staying ahead of the curve of public opinion, in 1971 the magazine was the first to feature a picture of African-American model Darine Stern on its front page . During the 80s the mansion got its reputation for allegedly hosting wild parties and orgies, fuelled by alcohol, cannabis and cocaine. Meanwhile the influence of the magazine continued to grow under the guise of female empowerment and fighting for minority rights. In 1971 Darine Stern became the first African-American to feature on the cover and nude inside. In 1985, at the height of the magazine's notoriety, Hefner suffered a minor stroke, causing him to reevaluate his lifestyle, handing over the reins of the mansion to his daughter, Christie, and in 1989 he married Playmate of the Year Kimberley Conrad with whom he had two children. Hefner purchased the infamous Playboy Mansion in 1971 which allegedly played host to drug and sex fuelled orgies well into the 1980s . But in 1985 Hefner suffered a minor stroke and handed over the reins of the palace to his daughter Christie . While the magazine campaigned for years on women's rights and sexual liberation, modern-day feminists have bitterly criticised it for objectifying women . Since then the Playboy empire has slowly declined as magazine sales have dropped off and audiences have complained that its image is outdated and demeaning to women. The 60th anniversary issue, which featured Moss dressed in the iconic tuxedo collar, cuffs, bunny ears and leotard on the front - and posed on all fours inside - provoked the ire of many feminist commentators. On the same day as the bus tour it was announced that former Miss February 2006 - Cassandra Lynn Hensley - had been found dead in her friend's bathtub of a suspected drug overdose.","Open topped bus filled with 60 bunnies toured Beverley Hills, LA .

"By . Zoe Szathmary . A former high school student is suing his former science teacher and school district for distress he suffered as a result of a sexual relationship with her -- and says it delayed his plans to join the military. The student, using the pseudonym Mark Smith, claimed in a lawsuit filed on Friday that teacher Rachelle Heenan took advantage of him, The Star-Telegram reports. Smith met Heenan in her class as a 17-year-old senior attending Hollenstein Career and Technology Center in February 2012. He had planned to join the Marine Corps as a diesel mechanic and was scheduled to do so one day after graduation. Rachelle Heenan, pictured, is being sued by a former student over the emotional distress he suffered as a result of their relationship . The two soon exchanged 'sexting' conversations,' the paper reports. They later met in a gym parking lot and checked into a hotel where they had sex. Heenan also allegedly engaged Smith in multiple sexual encounters -- including at school events, in hotels and her in own car. Heenan, the Star-Telegram says, was placed on administrative leave in May 2012 and indicted in February 2013 for an improper relationship between an educator and a student. She also was reportedly given five years of deferred adjudicated probation in a plea bargain. Heenan's page on the school's website said she has been married for ten years and has two children, WFAA reported in July 2012. The student met Heenan when he was a student in her forensic science class at Hollenstein Career and Technology Center, seen here . Smith's attorney Bobbie Edmonds told the paper the illicit relationship damaged him both mentally and emotionally -- and that his plans to join the Marine Corps were delayed. 'He was mentally impacted by what happened,' Edmonds said. 'He was impressionable, and there was the age difference and the fact that she was a teacher,' she said. In court documents, Edmonds says Heenan 'assaulted, raped and battered [Smith] in her capacity of teacher/educator, in violation of the law.' Smith also reportedly damaged school district property, costing over $24,000. Edmonds told the paper that emotional trauma related to the relationship caused him to act out. The lawsuit also reportedly claims that the Eagle Mountain-Saginaw school district 'failed to provide proper supervision, failed to act to warn or otherwise protect young victims and failed to secure the school premises from the sexual assaults that occurred on school premises and at school sponsored events and activities.'","A student, using the pseudonym Mark Smith to protect his identity, claims teacher Rachelle Heenan took advantage of him during their 2012 relationship .

"By . Katy Winter . A bride who was too ashamed to try on wedding dresses due to her size 20 frame has shed six-and-a-half stone down to a slim size ten. Hayley Tweddle, 28, from Welton, Lincolnshire, refused to start attending fittings for her wedding dress before her 2012 nuptials because she was too embarrassed to strip down to her underwear. And after squeezing into a plus-size white dress from the high street, she was mortified when she saw photographs of herself on her big day - and vowed to shed the pounds. Heyley bought her wedding dress for £40 from the high street without trying it on as she didn't feel worthy to step into a bridal shop . Hayley has managed to drop from a size 20 and 15st 7lbs (left) to a size 10 and 10st 10lbs (right) Now, the mother-of-one tips the scales at just over 10 and a half stone - and is looking forward to wearing a size 10 gown to renew her vows to husband Jonathan, 33. Hayley, 28, said: 'It should have been the happiest day of my life - the day every girl dreams of but instead I felt embarrassed and vulnerable as I was on display. 'I couldn’t look anyone in the eye and I felt uncomfortable being the centre of attention. 'I had always been overweight and never felt the same as everyone else. 'I was trapped in a cycle of not exercising and eating junk food. I piled on the pounds and felt terrible and ashamed of my body. When Hayley met husband Jonathan, 33, in 2008 she was a size 18, . However her diet - which included nightly takeaways and frequent meals out - meant Hayley soon found her weight increasing to 15-and-a-half stone and a size 20.

"By . Katy Winter . A military wife has given her husband a saucy surprise by stripping down to her underwear for a photo shoot. Sam Shand, 44, from Lincolnshire, used to be so self conscious she even refused to have photographs taken at her wedding to husband John, an RAF police officer. But after John was posted to Afghanistan for a six-month tour she missed him so much that she plucked up the courage to pose for the sexy snaps. Sam had the tasteful photos of her posing in lingerie done and sent an album of pictures to her husband on his tour of duty . Shy Sam, left, hates having her picture taken so much she had no photographer on her wedding day, but plucked up the courage to do the shoot to surprise her husband Jon who was on tour in Afganistan . She had the tasteful photos of her posing in lingerie done and sent an album as a surprise for John, 44, who is now having one of the snaps tattooed on his calf. Sam had the photo shoot done by Barnsley-based Helen Booth who runs Masque Photography. 'I’m hopeless at having my photo taken, I really don’t like it,' said Sam. 'It bothers me so much we didn't have a photographer at our wedding. Sam's husband John, an RAF police officer, is now going to have one of the pictures tattooed on his calf . 'It was a really big step for me to have photos taken professionally but also scantily clad because I am very conscious of my body. 'I thought I needed to do something to boost my ego and to cheer up John in Afghanistan. 'I came across Helen's website, and the fact she is a woman was a bit plus point. I couldn't have done this with a male photographer. 'I didn't tell John, and sent the photos as a complete surprise. Whenever he felt low he would look at the photos in his tent to cheer himself up, and that was the whole point of sending them. 'Communication is limited in Afghanistan, and it’s not the same as having the person next to you. 'Really, the photos were an ego boost for me, especially as we didn't have any wedding photos.' She added: 'If you speak to any military wife you get to a low ebb when your partner is away. The initial first two weeks is a novelty and you go back to being a single person coping on your own. 'But halfway through the tour the loneliness kicks in, not just for me but for John too.' Helen's package also includes a makeover from a professional hair and makeup stylist. She said: 'Boudoir photography is a must-do experience for women who like to treat themselves to a good old fashioned confidence boost. Sam says doing the raunchy shoot has vastly improved her self confidence . 'We put a huge emphasis on having a fabulous experience, as well as amazing photographs at the end of it. I love seeing women blossom in front of me and hearing their reactions once they have seen the photographs. 'Let's face it, it takes some courage to pose in your lingerie and have your photograph taken. I usually find that after the initial few shots any nerves my clients have fade and it becomes a really enjoyable experience.'","Sam Shand, 44, stripped down to bra and underpants for husband John .

"By . Louise Boyle . Body parts have washed up on a New York beach sparking fears the skeletal remains belong to missing 14-year-old autistic boy Avonte Oquendo. A torso, left arm, legs and a sneaker were found by a teenage girl on Thursday night on a beach at Hermon A. MacNeil Park in College Point, Queens, police said. Recovered clothing, including jeans and sneakers, matched what the missing teenager was wearing on October 4 when he wandered away from the Riverview School in Long Island City. Scroll down for video . A New York Police Department dive unit continues the search today for human remains after an arm and legs were discovered along a rocky shoreline in the Queens borough of New York . Skeletal remains were found on a Queens beach on Thursday night and were removed by the medical examiner. There are fears that the body parts belong to missing teenager Avonte Oquendo . A police source confirmed the clothing matched what Avonte was wearing when he disappeared to the Wall Street Journal. Oquendo family lawyer David Perecman also confirmed the pant and shoes sizes match what the 14-year-old was wearing the day he went missing. The remains have been taken to the Queens County Morgue to be positively identified and a cause of death determined. The process could take several days. In the meantime, Harbor Patrol divers and helicopters are continuing to search the area. The Oquendo family have been notified by the NYPD and are awaiting further information. The remains were found at least nine miles from where the child was last seen. For months, the boy's family has . organized search parties to scour the city for him, placed missing . posters on the subway and in stores and raising a $95,000 reward. In particular, subway tunnels were hunted as the teenager is fascinated with the transit system. A recording of his mother's voice was even played over tannoys in the hope of reaching the boy. The 14-year-old is particularly vulnerable because his type of autism leaves him unable to speak and in need of 24-hour care. There have been a few sightings of teenage boys who closely resemble Avonte, raising the family's hopes - but he remains missing. Avonte Oquendo, 14, who is autistic and cannot speak, is still missing almost four months after he ran out of his school in Long Island City, New York . Avonte Oquendo disappeared from his Long Island City school, New York on October 4. The remains were found on a Queens beach nine miles from where he was last seen . Police continue the search in the early hours of Friday for human remains after an arm and legs were discovered along a rocky shoreline in the Queens borough of New York . Police search the waterfront on Thursday after receiving a 911 call from a teenage girl who spotted the arm and legs . On January 5, the family posted a message on the Facebook page that they have set up to help find the boy pleading for FBI involvement. The message thanked volunteers for their continued help in looking for the missing teen over the winter holidays. The . message continued: 'We would like to clarify that we have sought the . help of the FBI and had petitioned them to take the lead in the . investigation regarding Avonte. 'There . are several legal reasons they gave us for not being legally permitted . to take over the investigation. The most noted is that the NYPD has . listed Avonte as a missing person, not a victim of kidnapping or other . such federal offense(s) that would require the FBI's involvement. 'It is our deepest desire for the FBI to get involved but there is a . system in place that requires protocol, we cannot force the FBI to get . involved and we continually ask and pray they do.'

"By . Mark Duell . A young woman who was brutally tortured in Afghanistan by her husband after she tried to escape their abusive forced marriage is on the road to recovery as doctors continue to rebuild her face. Aesha Mohammadzai, who believes she is 21 or 22, moved to the U.S. two years ago after fleeing the war-torn country and is now six months into her surgery at a hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. As part of the life-changing treatment, her forehead has ballooned and dark, drooping flesh now covers where her nose once was - before her husband sliced it off. Yet Aesha, who has never attended school . or celebrated her birthday, has insisted that she is no longer . scared to look at herself in the mirror, as her treatment reaches the . halfway stage. Scroll down for video . On the mend: Aesha Mohammadzai pictured six months into the reconstructive surgery to her nose . 'I don't care,' she told CNN. 'Everybody has some kind of problem. At the beginning, I was very scared. I was scared to look at my face in the mirror. 'I . was scared to think what will happen in the future to me. But now I'm . not scared anymore. Now I know the meaning of life, how to live. There, I . couldn't understand how to live.' Doctors . placed an inflatable silicone shell under the skin of her forehead and . gradually filled it with fluid in order to expand her skin and provide . them with extra tissue for her new nose. They . have also already taken tissue from her forearm and transplanted it to . her face to form the inner lining and lower part of the nose, doctors . told CNN. Doctors put a silicone shell under skin in her forehead to expand tissue that was then used to build her new nose . Terrifying: Aesha's nose and ears were sliced off by her abusive husband as she tried to escape their home . At ease: Aesha is pictured with her mother figure Jamila Rasouli-Arsala . Their next step is to take cartilage from Aesha's rib underneath her breast, which will be used to build her nose. The skin from her forehead will then be 'flapped down' to cover the structure. Aesha’s story was first told in August . 2010 by Time magazine, who published a harrowing cover photo of her - . horrifying people around the world and symbolising the oppression of . Afghan women. When she was . 12, her father promised her in marriage to a Taliban fighter to pay a . debt. She was handed over to his family who abused her and forced her to . sleep in the stable with the animals. But . when Aesha attempted to flee, she was caught and her nose and ears were . hacked off by her husband as punishment. Left for dead in the . mountains, she crawled to her grandfather's house. Famous photo: Aesha's story was first told in 2010 by Time magazine, who published this harrowing cover photo of her - horrifying people around the world and symbolising the oppression of Afghan women . She managed to get to a U.S. medical . facility, where medics cared for her for 10 weeks, and then was taken to . a secret shelter in Kabul before she was flown to the U.S. by a charity . to stay with a family. Nowadays . Aesha still prefers watching Bollywood films rather than American TV. She arrived in Maryland 16 months after she came to the US and had spent . time in California and New York. Aesha . is being treated at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre in . Bethesda, which was arranged for her by the office of outgoing U.S. Representative Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland.

Recovery: Bibi Aisha (pictured with a prosthetic nose in Beverly Hills, California, in October 2010) moved to the U.S. after fleeing Afghanistan . But Aesha will look far worse before . she stars to look better, and her forehand already has major swelling, . while darkened and drooping flesh is currently where her nose once was, . reported CNN. She was given a . prosthetic nose at first, but full plastic surgery had to be delayed . because it was thought she was still not emotionally stable to cope with . the painful and lengthy surgery required. Aesha . was said to have displayed volatile mood swings in the past - . oscillating between violent tantrums and displaying deep affection to . people around her - so the surgery is a huge milestone. ‘What . happened, it's part of me, part of my life and it's all the time in my . mind and with me,’ she told CNN. ‘But I have to live, and I have to . love.’ American dream: Aesha now lives in Bethesda, Maryland, (pictured) where she is being treated at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre .","Aesha Mohammadzai moved to the US in 2010 and lives in Maryland .

"By . Katy Winter . Zara Phillips gave birth to a 7lbs 12oz baby girl at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital in the early hours of this morning, with her husband and former England rugby player Mike Tindall present at the birth. In typically energetic style, she has already left hospital and is back at home with her family. Early on in her pregnancy the Olympian admitted: 'I have been a bit bored. I'm used to being on the go and active the whole time, and now it's quite different. So, yes, I'm baking. I love cooking and will definitely cook for the baby.' However, it hasn't all been flapjacks and fondant fancies: the Queen's sporty granddaughter has refused to let pregnancy slow her down too much... Scroll down for video . The 32-year-old attended the Heythrop Hunt point-to-point races in Gloucestershire just a few days ago . Continuing the very active manner in which she has approached her pregnancy, the Queen's granddaughter was still out and about just a couple of days before she was due to give birth . Zara has kept remarkably active during her pregnancy, here standing on a car boot ledge to get a better view at  Cottenham point-to-point races in Cambridgeshire on December 30 . Just two weeks from giving birth at the time, the Olympian was wrapped up against the cold in a brown padded jacket which had a fur-lined hood . She's attended various country . point-to-points - one in Cambridgeshire on Sunday - and the races at . Cheltenham in the last month. She's . dressed up for black tie events, such as the British Olympic Ball and . the reunion of the 2004 Rugby Union World Cup-winning squad in November, . while heavily pregnant. In fact, Zara's sense of style appears to have blossomed along with her bump during the last nine months. She . dazzled onlookers at Sandringham in a bright red jacket and matching . hat trimmed with jaunty feathers and a black MUlberry ckutch at the . Christmas Day service at St Mary Magdalene Church on the vast Norfolk . estate. The professional . three-day eventer was pictured early in her pregnancy taking part in a . show jumping event and even playing polo, but gave up competing in her fifth month and has . since been channelling her energy into helping a race horse part-owned . by her husband become a champion. Zara looked blooming lovely as she joined fellow Royals for the family's annual Christmas Day church service at Sandringham . At eight months pregnant, Zara swathed her impressive bump in a bright red jacket and matching hat for the service at St Mary Magdalene Church on the vast Norfolk estate . Prior to the service, Zara appeared to have put comfort first as she paired a warm black winter coat with a pair of knee-high brown stretchy boots . In December, the horse, Monbeg Dude, won the Majordomo Hospitality Handicap Steeple Chase at Cheltenham. Miss . Phillips, who won silver at the London Olympics as part of the British . three-day eventing team, said she has stopped riding not because she had . been criticised for it but because it had become too difficult in the . fifth month of her pregnancy. She . said: ‘It’s so uncomfortable. So now I’m just on the ground yelling at . everyone.’ But she added that she will back on her horse as soon as . possible after the birth.

At seven months pregnant, Zara showed no signs of slowing down as she watched her husband Mike Tindall's horse Monbeg Dude come fourth in the Murphy Group Handicap Chase in November . The . couple revealed that Zara's pregnancy came as a complete ‘shock’ to her . – disrupting her eventing schedule and forcing her out of the saddle. Speaking . to an Australian Women’s Weekly in October, Mike said: ‘It probably . happened quicker than we thought – bit of a shock, really.’ But he admitted that once the surprise had worn off, they realised the timing was perfect. Zara . says she will be back in the saddle straight after the birth. She even . hopes to compete in the World Eventing Championship in August and will . take her baby with her on the eventing circuit – which is what her . mother Princess Anne did after Zara was born. The 32-year-old royal showed off her growing bump in a clinging black dress as she attended the reunion of the 2003 Rugby Union World Cup winning squad at the start of November . Zara attended the rugby event with her husband, her second red carpet event in a single week . Zara Phillips arrives at the British Olympic Ball held at The Dorchester at the end of October, days before attending another glamorous black tie event . Typically, Zara and Mike Tindall have appeared very laid-back during the pregnancy. Mike revealed the couple didn't want to know the sex of their baby before the birth. Mr . Tindall said in October: ‘We want it to be a surprise. I’m really . looking forward to it, but I’m not sure how I’ve prepared. We’ve been . pretty relaxed. ‘We’ve not sorted a nursery yet. We have ordered some stuff, but we haven’t gone further than that. ‘I . think we’re both quite well-balanced as a couple, so hopefully he or . she will pick up on that. I’m a big kid, so I naturally fit right in.’ Zara added: ‘I hope we’re going to make good parents – that’s the plan.’ Zara, who was the only member of the royal family to be godparent, attending Prince George's christening in October in a chic navy blue ensemble .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Hitler's bodyguard, the last surviving member of the Fuhrer’s entourage who was with him in the Berlin bunker on the day he killed himself, has died aged 96. Rochus Misch was a member of the SS and deeply admired Hitler, calling him ‘the Boss’ up until the end of his own life. He was the telephone operator in the underground refuge when Hitler and his bride Eva Braun killed themselves on April 30, 1945. Cult: Rochus Misch, pictured outside the famous Berlin bunker left,  was Hitler's bodyguard for five years . Underground: The site of Hitler's bunker in Berlin pictured in 1947 . Misch died in a hospital less than three miles from the site of the bunker near the Brandenburg Gate. He was born in 1917 and joined the SS in 1937. After being wounded in battle he was assigned to the Fuhrer’s SS Escort. Leader: Adolf Hitler, pictured here giving the Nazi salute from his car in 1934, was served by Misch during the Second World War . He . steadfastly claimed after the war that he never heard Hitler talking . about the destruction of the Jews, nor was he ever asked to transmit a . message about the Holocaust through the equipment entrusted to him. ‘He . was so nice, so friendly,’ he would say. ‘The Boss was good to me. I . can never imagine him as a mass murderer. As the war went on he became . more lonely, staring for hours on end at a portrait of Frederick the . Great. The war took a great toll on him.’ He . also recalled seeing the bodies of Hitler and Braun after they killed . themselves. ‘I saw Hitler slumped with his head on the table. Eva Braun . was lying on the sofa. Her knees were drawn tightly up to her chest.’ Misch . was captured by the Russians in May 1945 and taken to Moscow, where he . was tortured. After eight years in prison camps  he returned to Berlin . and took over a friend’s painting business. Films: Hilter is portrayed here in the 2005 film Downfall. In the film Heinrich Schmieder played Misch . He was even consulted by Christopher McQuarrie, the writer of 2008 film Valkyrie, about an assassination attempt on . Hitler's life. Hollywood actor Tom Cruise, who starred in the . film, refused to meet Misch and told the Los Angeles . Times: 'I didn't want to meet him. Evil is still evil, I don't care how . old you are.'

"By . Associated Press . Less than six months on the job, the mayor of Charlotte was arrested Wednesday and accused of accepting more than $48,000 in bribes from undercover FBI agents posing as businessmen who wanted to do work with North Carolina's largest city. Mayor Patrick Cannon, a 47-year-old Democrat who rose from the city's public housing projects to become a successful businessman and politician, faces federal theft and bribery charges. Cannon accepted more than $48,000 in cash, airline tickets, a hotel room and the use of a luxury apartment as bribes and solicited more than $1 million more, according to a criminal complaint. FILE - In this Oct. 29, 2013, file photo, candidate for Charlotte mayor Patrick Cannon speaks to students at Queens University in Charlotte, N.C.  Cannon, now mayor of Charlotte, was arrested Wednesday, March 26, 2014, on public corruption charges. U.S. Attorney Anne Tompkins says that Cannon solicited and accepted bribes from undercover FBI agents posing as real estate developers who wanted to do business in Charlotte. (AP Photo/Chuck Burton, File) While working with the undercover agents, . Cannon touted his close relationship with Republican Gov. Pat McCrory . and a trip to the White House to meet with President Barack Obama and . other administration officials, according to the complaint. At one point, an undercover agent said to Cannon: 'You're operating at quite a level Patrick.' If convicted on all the charges, Cannon faces up to 50 years in prison and more than $1 million in fines. Cannon, a longtime radio show host and the founder of E-Z parking, a parking management company, was elected mayor in November, replacing Anthony Foxx, who was named Transportation Secretary by Obama. Telephone messages left for Cannon were not immediately returned. He had an initial court appearance Wednesday and was released on $25,000 unsecured bond. According to the complaint, FBI agents posing as commercial real estate developers paid Cannon on five separate occasions between January 2013 and February 2014. Cannon accepted cash in exchange for access to city officials responsible for planning, zoning and permitting. On the last occasion, Cannon accepted $20,000 in cash in the mayor's office, the complaint said. U.S. attorney's office spokeswoman Lia Bantavani said the investigation was ongoing. She declined further comment. That was fast: Cannon has only been mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina's largest city and home to nearly 800,000 people, since November. He was released on $25,000 unsecured bond Wednesday . The investigation began in August 2010 after a tip from a local undercover officer about public corruption. At the time, Cannon still held an at-large seat on the Charlotte City Council. He was first elected to the council in 1993 at age 26, becoming the youngest council member in the city's history. When he was 5, his father was found dead of a gunshot wound outside a vacant school. He was raised by his mother, Carmen, who worked on a truck assembly line. They lived in housing projects. After graduating from South Mecklenburg High, he earned a degree in communications with a minor in marketing from historically black North Carolina A&T State University in Greensboro. McCrory, a former Charlotte mayor, said he was saddened and angered by the charges. He said he had known Cannon's family for more than 30 years. 'But more than anything, my heart is broken for the city of Charlotte,' McCrory said. 'This is not the city that I know, served and love. This alleged behavior is inexcusable and cannot be tolerated.' McCrory's older brother Phil McCrory was a mentor to Cannon in the Big Brothers Big Sisters program. Their relationship grew into a strong friendship, according Karen Calder, the group's chief executive. Cannon was even a groomsman in Phil McCrory's wedding. According to the complaint, Cannon also accepted $12,500 from an undercover agent to help him develop a feminine hygiene product called 'Hers.' In exchange, Cannon offered to help the agent â€” posing as a business manager for a venture capital company â€” get the necessary permits to open a nightclub. Cannon later had a discussion with the undercover agent, apparently attempting to clarify that the money was strictly seed money for the ""Hers"" product and not payment for his help in opening the nightclub. 'OK, so I mean, 'cause I'm not, I'm not one of those Chicago or Detroit type (of) folk,' Cannon told the agent, apparently referring to high-profile corruption cases in those cities. Cannon ended the conversation by saying he looked good 'in an orange necktie, but not an orange suit,' according to the complaint. When the agent set up two later meetings to discuss the money and give Cannon an opportunity to return it, Cannon did not to show up, the complaint said. During his campaign, Cannon promoted plans to create jobs in a city of 760,000 people that has become one of the nation's leading banking and energy centers. In May, two days after Cannon announced he was running for mayor, the first undercover agent introduced him to a second undercover agent posing as a developer from Las Vegas. The second agent told Cannon he was interested in developments along a streetcar and light rail line being built in Charlotte. Cannon provided the proposed routes and stops, according to the complaint. Cannon agreed to fly to Las Vegas to convince a group of potential foreign investors to invest in the company purportedly owned by the second agent. Even though the two had known each other only about a month, Cannon agreed to tell the investors he had known the agent for years. The complaint said Cannon acknowledged the story he would tell investors was false, saying, 'Well, if it's made up, it really doesn't matter.' Cannon and the second agent also discussed compensating Cannon for his part in the scheme, and Cannon suggested that he receive a campaign donation before he made the trip to Las Vegas. Instead, the agent agreed to pay for Cannon's trip to Las Vegas, plus $6,000 cash for spending money for his wife. The Cannons received the first $1,000 when they arrived in Las Vegas; they received the other $5,000 after Cannon gave his presentation to the purported investors. Thomas Mills, a longtime Democratic consultant in North Carolina, said Cannon ""probably needs to step down and the sooner the better."" But Mills said he's doesn't believe Cannon's arrest will place additional damage upon North Carolina Democrats, who have suffered heavily from electoral losses in 2010 and 2012. ""Charlotte has always been a bit of its own entity. It would be more of a problem if it were coming out of the General Assembly or out of Raleigh,"" he said. A couple of city leaders said it was up to the mayor to decide whether he should resign. 'I found out about what was going on and I was devastated for Charlotte,' City Councilwoman Claire Fallon said. 'I ache for my city.'","Patrick Cannon allegedly accepted bribes from undercover FBI agents in exchange for access to city planning officials .

"By . James  Nye . The number of people missing after a landslide sent a wall of mud crashing into dozens of rural Washington state homes dropped to 90 on Wednesday, as officials reported finding more bodies while acknowledging that some victims' remains may never be recovered. The known death toll remained at 24, including eight people whose bodies had yet to be recovered after the disaster near the tiny town of Oso, where a rain-soaked hillside collapsed on Saturday and cascaded over a river and a road, engulfing homes on the opposite bank. Officials said more bodies had been found in the debris field on Wednesday, but declined to say how many until the remains had been removed and sent to a medical examiner's office.

Asked whether he expected the death toll to rise significantly, Governor Jay Inslee told CNN: 'Yes, I don't think anyone can reach any other conclusion.' Snohomish County's emergency management director, John Pennington, told reporters the tally of missing had dropped dramatically to 90 from 176, but the fate of as many as 35 more people not officially listed as missing remained uncertain. Eight other people survived the slide but were injured, including a 22-week-old baby rescued with his mother and listed in critical condition although he was improving. The mother and three other survivors also remained hospitalized. The slide already ranks as one of the worst in the United States. In 1969, 150 people were killed in landslides and floods in Virginia, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

About 200 search personnel, many wearing rain gear and hard hats, painstakingly combed through the disaster zone under cloudy skies on Wednesday, taking advantage of a break from Tuesday's rain showers to hasten their search for more victims. White markers were placed at the edge of the gouged slope to help in detecting any further shifting of the hillside. Snohomish County Battalion Fire Chief Steve Mason, directing part of the operation, said teams were making slow but steady progress in locating additional remains.

But Jan McClelland, a volunteer firefighter from Darrington who was among the first to arrive at the scene and has spent long days digging through the thick gray muck, conceded it was possible some bodies may end up forever entombed at the site. 'I'm fearful we won't find everyone,' she said. 'That's the reality of it.' County officials also started to address criticism for allowing new home construction in the area after a 2006 landslide in the same vicinity, which followed numerous reports detailing the risks of slides dating back to the 1950s. A 1999 study by geologist Daniel Miller for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had warned of the potential for a 'large catastrophic failure' in the area, about 55 miles northeast of Seattle. The county's emergency management director, John Pennington, told reporters that local authorities had spent millions of dollars on work to reduce landslide risks in the area after the 2006 event. He suggested that while officials and residents were aware of vulnerability to unstable hill slopes, Saturday's tragedy came out of the blue. Watch Video Here: .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A teen from a Chicago suburb is being hailed as a hero these days after he saved the life of another child who fell through the ice on covering a retention pond earlier this week. Zac Thomas, 14, was walking near the pond when he saw a younger boy in the water and in distress. Footprints seen in the snow covering the ice show the exact route the 9-year-old took near the bank of the pond. His footprints, however, come to an abrupt end in the spot where he fell through. Hero: Zac Thomas says he credits the Boy Scouts for teaching him what to do if someone falls through the ice . Luckily, Thomas - a long-time Boy Scout - happened to be walking by. 'The first thing that went through my mind was to get him out, Thomas told CBS Chicago. That's when his Boy Scout training kicked in. 'I ran down there, and I stood on the grass and I reached out and I grabbed his hand and I pulled him out,' Zac says. Frigid: The 9-year-old fell through the ice at this pond and had almost his entire body submerged in icy water . After getting the boy out of the water, he walked him back to his house, where his sisters were waiting for him. When asked if he was worried that he, too, might get pulled into the icy water by helping the younger boy, Zac says 'yes and no because if I went in, I know how to get out because Boy Scouts taught me.' After saving the boy and delivering him to his family, Zac returned home to his proud parents. Proud: Zac's mom, Angela Prusinski, says she's proud of the man her son is turning out to be . 'Heâ€™s a just a great kid. Heâ€™s growing up fast and making good decisions on a daily basis,' mother Angela Prusinski says. The boy who fell through the ice is reportedly doing OK - and his mother is incredibly grateful Zac saved her young son.","The 9-year-old's body was almost completely submerged in icy water .

"By . SIMON JONES . Hulk has caused a stir by posting pictures of himself flying into Luton Airport with his Zenit team-mate Luis Neto. He is being offered to clubs in England while Monaco have expressed an interest following the injury to his former Porto strike partner Radamel Falcao. The Brazil forward's representatives have been looking to talk to Manchester City and Chelsea to see if they have interest. Chelsea, who will be without Fernando Torres for a month, made a substantial offer to Zenit St Petersburg in August for the 27-year-old and could pave way for his arrival if they accept Trabzonspor's bid for Demba Ba.

West Ham are pressing ahead with discussions today over loan deals for AC Milan's Antonio Nocerino and Roma's Marco Borriello, as revealed in Sportsmail, but they have made a surprise move for Leeds United favourite Ross McCormack. The Scotland forward has scored 18 goals this season and the Hammers have made an offer of £3million plus an extra £1m based on appearances for the 27-year-old. Leeds knocked back bids from Middlesbrough at the start of the season and are holding out for £5m. A Premier League club would be difficult to resist for the player. West Ham have also watched Osasuna midfielder Raoul Loe who could be prised out for £2m. Manager Sam Allardyce wants a greater presence in midfield and Loe is an option with Nocerino while Raul Meireles is also under consideration.

They have asked about Wayne Hennessey at Wolves but are now looking at FC Groningen's Marco Bizot. The 6ft 5in keeper is a Holland U21 keeper who developed at Ajax before ending up at Groningen, where he has caught the eye with some match-saving performances in an ever-present season that has seen them challenge for a Europa League place. Schmeichel, 27, is out of contract in the summer but Milan need younger blood to freshen up a squad that is struggling badly. Wales keeper Hennessey has been a target for Crystal Palace also but is keen on a move to West Ham. Big future: Marco Bizot, the 6ft 5in Groningen keeper, is wanted by Leicester City . Tottenham have been looking at bringing in another striker but, despite Tim Sherwood's hopes of buying British, they may still find the better quality is abroad. They have been offered Fabio Quagliarella of Juventus, Inter Milan's unhappy-but-versatile midfielder Fredy Guarin and Hulk. Guarin is not on the wanted list nor is he at Manchester United.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Freeze: The Department of Health has suggested it wants to call an end to NHS pay rises (library image) The Government is today facing threats of industrial action after signalling it wants to call a halt to NHS pay rises. Instead of using funding set aside for a 1 per cent pay rise for staff, the Department of Health (DoH) is proposing it is spent on the modernisation of pay structures. In its submission to the NHS pay review body, the department said the NHS was facing the biggest financial challenge in its history. The submission read: 'Despite real terms growth in its budget in successive years, it needs to continue to secure improved value from the taxpayers' investment, if it is to meet the growing pressures it faces in the years to come both from an ageing and growing population and the need to improve the quality of care provide.' Unions reacted with anger, saying that even raising the prospect of a pay freeze would demoralise staff. Rehana Azam, national officer of the GMB trade union, said: 'GMB members in the NHS are already totally fed up with this Government's cuts to NHS services and jobs, which staff know is putting patient wellbeing at risk. 'If the Government now wants to attack NHS staff pay while offering tax cuts to married couples it will be the final straw that will lead to calls for industrial action.' Peter Carter, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: 'It is demoralising for nursing staff to discover that while senior managers have enjoyed a pay increase of 13% since 2009, the Government are asking frontline staff to take another pay freeze to save the NHS money. 'It is completely unfair to say a pay increase of just 1%, following years of real-terms pay cuts, will prevent employers from recruiting more nurses and put patient safety at risk. 'It is simply wrong to imply that regular pay rises are awarded to NHS staff simply for time served, when this is not the case. 'Increments are only paid when a nurse can demonstrate their experience and skills have improved. It is the responsibility of employers to ensure this appraisal system is working properly.' Phil Gray, chief executive of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said: 'This is a very disappointing move that shows contempt for the principle of working together in partnership to produce a fair deal for NHS staff. Fight back: Unions say the Government's call for a pay freeze for NHS staff would lead to calls for industrial action (library image) 'Those hard-working and dedicated professionals have suffered a real-terms pay cut of up to 12% in recent years and only stood to gain 1% from April. 'The Government should step back from this ill-judged position and allow next year's pay rise to go ahead.' The health department said the dilemma is 'either pay staff more, accepting that this may do little to improve the quality of care for patients and is likely to restrict the number of staff employers can afford to employ, or, to reform contracts to enable employers to use their pay bill, as part of their overall employment offer, to maintain safe staffing levels, with stronger links to performance, quality and productivity'. It claimed the 1 per cent pay rise was not affordable alongside the current NHS system which sees incremental salary rises linked to length of service and performance. Announcement: George Osborne said public sector pay rises in 2015/16 'will be limited to an average of up to 1 per cent' in his June spending review . In his spending review in June, Chancellor George Osborne said public sector pay rises in 2015/16 'will be limited to an average of up to 1 per cent'. But he also said the Government would reform 'antiquated' systems of automatic pay progression that were seeing some salaries rise by 7 per cent 'regardless of performance'. He told the commons: 'Progression pay can at best be described as antiquated; at worst, it's deeply unfair to other parts of the public sector who don't get it and to the private sector who have to pay for it. 'So we will end automatic progression pay in the civil service by 2015-16. And we are working to remove automatic pay rises simply for time served in our schools, NHS, prisons and police.' The DoH quoted the Chancellor's words in its submission to the pay review bodies, and said the national medical pay frameworks meant rises worth around Â£200 million a year. It said: 'This is out of step with our wider policy on public sector pay and the ambitions the Chancellor set out in the spending round.' 'The 1 per cent that the Government has made available for pay in the spending round would, in our view, be best deployed in supporting the modernisation of national pay frameworks. 'In particular, that the reform of medical contracts should seek to improve the quality of patient care and therefore outcomes by ensuring there is a better balance between pay, performance, and productivity rather than time served. 'Substantial reforms to progression pay will be taken forward or are already under way across the public sector. 'The priority for this pay round therefore, should be support for continued reform of national contracts so that they deliver improvements in performance and productivity, are affordable and fit for purpose. 'Putting patients at the heart of everything the NHS does means ensuring services are available seven days a week and that staff are rewarded for what they do for patients, not time served.'","Department of Health says money for pay rises should be spent on reform .

"By . Ap . Taco Bell is name-dropping an unlikely clown to promote its new breakfast menu - Ronald McDonald. The fast-food chain will begin airing ads Thursday that feature everyday men who happen to have the same name as the McDonald's mascot known for his bright red hair and yellow jumpsuit. The marketing campaign is intended to promote Taco Bell's new breakfast menu, which features novelties like a waffle taco. The chain, owned by Yum Brands Inc. of Louisville, Ky., is looking to boost sales by opening most of its roughly 6,000 U.S. stores a few hours earlier at 7 a.m. starting this week. But Taco Bell has a long way to go to catch up with McDonald's, the No. 1 player in breakfast with about 31 percent of the category, according to market researcher Technomic. Ronald: Taco Bell's ad campaign to promote its new breakfast menu includes more than 400 men named Ronald McDonald . Disclaimer: In the ad, Taco Bell offers a disclaimer saying 'These Ronald McDonald's are not affiliated with McDonalds' The popularity of Egg McMuffins and other items have been a consistent sales driver for McDonald's over the years, with breakfast accounting for about 20 percent of the company's U.S. sales.By comparison, a Yum executive has said that breakfast accounted for just 4 percent of sales when it was being tested at Taco Bell stores in select markets. That was before national marketing began, however, and Taco Bell president Brian Niccol said in a phone interview that the goal was to get the figure to a level 'much greater than that.' Taco Bell said the real-life Ronald McDonalds featured in its new ads were paid for their appearances. But Niccol, who said he didn't know how much they were paid, insists their enthusiastic reactions to the food were real. Ronalds: Of the ad, Taco Bell President Brian Niccol says 'we like to do things with a wink and a smile' Breakfast: Taco Bell hopes to compete with McDonald's in the fast-food breakfast market, which the burger chain has dominated . 'All of them resoundingly loved the food,' he said. Taco Bell's ad agency, Deutsche LA, found around 400 men and women with the name Ronald McDonald, Ronnie McDonald or some variation, Niccol said. A couple dozen were selected to represent different regions around the country including Bossier City, La.; Chicago; Dubuque, Iowa; Kane, Pa. and Worcester, Ma. The men show their approval of the food with comments like, 'It's not messy' and 'Mmm, wow' and 'Mmm, real good' and 'It has everything I like.' Not 'Lovin' it': This Ronald McDonald is probably less enthusiastic about Taco Bell's breakfast menu than the Ronald McDonald's in the new ad . In case it wasn't clear, tiny print at the end of the ad notes that, 'These Ronald McDonalds are not affiliated with McDonald's Corporation and were individually selected as paid endorsers of Taco Bell Breakfast.' 'We like to do things with a wink and smile,' Niccol said. 'We have a sense of humor.' As for Ronald McDonald the fast-food clown, the character was first played by Willard Scott in 1963. He was initially depicted as a character that magically pulled hamburgers and fries out of his belt. But the mascot eventually became a target of critics who say McDonald's uses him to market to kids.","Taco Bell hopes to compete with McDonald's for dominance of the fast-food breakfast market .

"By . Anthony Bond . Attacked: Malala Yousafzai was shot on her way home from school . The horrific moment a Taliban gunman boarded a packed school bus and shot a teenage education . activist twice at point blank range has been relived by her devastated friend. Malala Yousafzai, 14, was critically injured . after being shot while travelling home from school earlier this week. The brave teenager was targeted by the Taliban after speaking out against atrocities committed under the regime. According to Malala's friend Shazia, speaking to the Christian Science . Monitor, a group of militants riding on a bike stopped the bus carrying the schoolgirls. Masked men then boarded the vehicle and pointed guns at the girls, . asking for Malala. A hooded Taliban militant shouted: 'Which one of you is Malala? Speak . up, otherwise I will shoot you all. She is propagating against the . soldiers of Allah, the Taliban. She must be punished.' Almost as soon as he shouted this, the militant recognised the youngster and shot her at point blank range. The . shooting has horrified people in Pakistan and internationally, and has . been followed by an outpouring of respect for a girl who earned the . enmity of the Taliban for publicising their acts and speaking about the . importance of girls' education. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the shooting, saying that the girl was promoting 'Western thinking'. Malala was shot twice at close range and is currently unconscious in hospital in a critical condition. Speaking to CBS News, a close friend of the family said doctors had given relatives a 'ray of hope' . The woman said MRI scans showed that a bullet which had entered the skull did not cause significant damage to her brain. A number of people have been arrested . by police in Pakistan in connection with the shooting. A . Taliban spokesman said the top leadership of the Taliban's Swat Valley . chapter decided two months ago to kill Yousufzai in a carefully-planned . attack after her family ignored repeated warnings. Scroll down for update on Malala's condition . Stable: Malala being transported between hospital wards. The teenage Pakistani children's rights activist was shot in the head on a school bus in the former Taliban stronghold of Swat . Attempt: A Pakistani Taliban organisation have . taken responsibility for the shooting which also injured another girl on . the bus leaving their school in Mingora . Police have been questioning people in . the town of Mingora, where the shooting took place.It is believed they . are holding two people in custody with suspected links to the shooting. Mingora . police chief Afzal Khan Afridi said arrests had been made, but he . declined to give any details about the number of people detained or what . role they're suspected in having in the shooting. He said he did not . want to endanger the ongoing investigation. The . Taliban spokesman, Sirajuddin Ahmad, said her family had been warned . three times - the most recent warning coming last week - before the . decision was made to execute her. Ahmad . said the local Taliban leader Maulana Fazlullah and his deputies . selected three attackers, including two trained snipers, who carefully . studied the girl's route home from school. Even before the Taliban took over the Swat Valley, Fazlullah's radio broadcasts spread fear among residents in the area. The . group first started to exert its influence in 2007 and quickly extended . its reach to much of the valley by the next year. Recovering: A 'stable' Malala Yousafzai, is moved to a helicopter to be taken to Peshawar for treatment . Wounded: Hospital staff assist Malala Yousafzai as she arrives at Saidu Sharif Teaching Hospital after the attack in the Swat Valley region in northwest Pakistan . Help: Crowds gathered around the hospital as news quickly spread about the attempted assassination of the young peace activist . They set about . imposing their will on residents by forcing men to grow beards, . preventing women from going to the market and blowing up many schools - . the majority for girls. Malala . wrote about these practices in a journal for the BBC under a pseudonym . when she was just 11. After the Taliban were pushed out of the valley in . 2009 by the Pakistani military, she became even more outspoken in . advocating for girls' education. She appeared frequently in the media . and was given one of the country's highest honours for civilians for her . bravery. Fazlullah, along . with much of the Swat Taliban's top leadership, escaped the offensive . and is believed to be operating from a base in eastern Afghanistan and . sending fighters back across the border to attack northwest Pakistan. Yousufzai . is now being treated at a military hospital in the city of Rawalpindi. A . military spokesman says her condition is satisfactory but the next . 36-48 hours would be crucial. The schoolgirl had been transferred to the specialist hospital following Taliban threats to kill her, and authorities in Pakistan decided to move her for her own safety. Outrage: Activists carry photographs of Malala Yousafzai during a protest rally against her assassination attempt . Support: Demonstrators in Mingora hold banners reading 'we want peace on our motherland' and 'attack on Malala Yousafzai is an unsuccessful attempt to destroy peace in the valley' United: Women hold banners demanding education rights during a protest in Islamabad . Regional governor Masood Kausar said earlier this week: . 'The security agencies are closely working with each other and they have . a lot of information about the perpetrators. We hope our security . agencies will soon capture them and bring to justice.' The shooting has drawn condemnation . from world leaders and many Pakistanis. There have been protests . against the Taliban across the country in support of Malala. Her father, Ziauddin Yousufzai, who . runs a girls' school, said his daughter had defied threats for years, . believing the good work she was doing for her community was her best . protection. 'Pray for her,' her distraught uncle Faiz Mohammad said as Malala was taken from the hospital in Peshawar to the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology in Rawalpindi. A husband-and-wife team of two . British doctors who were attending a seminar in Pakistan joined . local surgeons in treating Yousufzai. Earlier this week, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the United States had offered any assistance necessary. 'The President found the news reprehensible and disgusting and tragic,' Carney told reporters. 'Directing violence at children is . barbaric, it's cowardly, and our hearts go out to her and the others who . were wounded as well as their families.' Yousufzai had spent the last three years campaigning for girls' education after the Taliban shut down girls' schools. She received Pakistan's highest civilian award but also a number of death threats. Fury over the attack has spread across . the country, with demonstrators protesting in Lahore, Peshawar, . Islamabad and Mingora. Many schools in Swat Valley closed . their doors in protest over the shooting, and the country's army chief . vowed to fight on against militants as anger erupted across the nation. The Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have taken responsibility for the assassination attempt and told a . Pakistani newspaper they will target her again if she survives. A man approached the school bus and . asked which one of the girls was Malala, Rasool Shah, Mingora police . chief said. Malala was pointed out by a girl near her, but after the young activist lied about her identity the gunman shot both of them.","Malala Yousafzai shot in the neck and head on a school bus in Mingora .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A dramatic decline in births among immigrant women hard hit by the recession is seen as the main cause of a record low in the U.S. birth rate. According to a study by the Pew Research Center the overall birth rate across the country fell by 8 per cent between 2007 and 2010 and by 6 per cent among U.S.-born women. The rate fell sharpest for those hardest hit by the recession - 14 per cent among all foreign-born women and including a 23 per cent drop for Mexican immigrant women. The 2011 rate was the lowest since 1920, when such records began. Fall: While still higher than the rate of births to U.S.-born women, the number of immigrants giving birth fell sharply . According to a study by the Pew Research Center the overall birth rate across the U.S. fell by 8 per cent between 2007 and 2010 and by 6 per cent among U.S.-born women . Foreign-born mothers continue to give birth to a disproportionate share of the nation's newborns.Last year there were 3.95million total U.S. births, according to the preliminary data. The overall U.S. birth rate was 63.2 per 1,000 women of child-bearing age considerably lower than it's 1957 peka during the Baby Boom years when it reached 122.7 per 1,000 women. According to D'Vera Cohn, an author of the report, the fall is not because there are fewer immigrant women capable of giving birth, but because of a change in their behavior. She said: 'the economic downturn seems to play a pretty large role in the drop in the fertility rate.' Better access to contraception for Latino women may also be playing a part in the falling birth rate, according to the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health. The overall U.S. birth rate peaked most recently in the Baby Boom years, reaching 122.7 per 1,000 women of child-bearing age in 1957, nearly double today¿s rate of 63.2 . The 23 per cent share of all births to foreign-born mothers in 2010 was higher than the 13 per cent immigrant share of the U.S. population, and higher than the 17 per cent share of women aged 15-44 who are immigrants. The 2010 birth rate for foreign-born women (87.8) was nearly 50 per cent higher than the rate for U.S.-born women (58.9). Total U.S. births in 2010 were 4million—roughly 3.1million to U.S.-born women and 930,000 to immigrant women. In 2011, according to preliminary data, there were 3.95million total births. Population projections from the Pew Research Center indicate that immigrants will continue to play a large role in U.S. population growth. The projections suggest that immigrants arriving since 2005 and their descendants will account for fully 82 per cent of U.S. population growth by 2050. Even if the lower immigration influx of recent years continues, new immigrants and their descendants are still projected to account for most of the nation’s population increase by mid-century.","The Pew Research Center the overall birth rate across the country fell by 8 per cent between 2007 and 2010 .

"By . Julie Anne Barnes . Discovery: Traces of pork gelatine have been found in the nasal spray flu vaccine, due to be rolled-out across Glasgow on Wednesday (library image) Scotland's largest immunisation programme has been delayed after Muslim parents raised concerns that the vaccination contained pork gelatine. The roll-out of the flu vaccine nasal spray pilot programme was due to begin at 54 schools in Glasgow on Wednesday. Around 100,000 children from primary schools across Scotland are being offered the nasal spray Fluenz. But NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said the roll-out had been postponed until Monday after parents at Glendale Primary in Pollokshields on the south side of Glasgow became aware of the issue. Now, parents will be able to request that their child receives the vaccination by injection rather than through the nasal spray. A spokesman for the health board said: ‘These concerns relate to the nasal spray vaccine which contains a tiny amount of gelatine of pork origin used during the manufacturing process.’ Dr Syed Ahmed, consultant in public medicine with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said the health board had written to parents to reassure them. He said: ‘We have highlighted that the World Health Organisation (WHO) offered guidance in 2001 following a meeting of more than 100 Muslim scholars in Kuwait. 'The scholars agreed to issue advice to Muslims that gelatine of pork origin used in vaccines and other medicines is judicially permissible as the gelatine in the final product is a completely changed substance. ‘However we have also confirmed that any parent who remains concerned about the small amount of gelatine in the nasal spray can request that their child can be given an alternative flu vaccination by injection.’ The Scottish Government is gradually expanding the annual flu vaccination programme to include all children aged two to 17 over the next few years.

A Scottish Government spokesman said the Immunisation Scotland website provides more information. She added: ‘Many medicines, including vaccines, used all over the world contain traces of bovine and porcine gelatine.

"By . Deni Kirkova . On the fourth day of Berlin fashion week - which has so far offered sophisticated retro looks and daring transparent bridal wear - French-Austrian designer Marina Hoermanseder showcased her quirky medical-inspired Autumn/Winter 13/14 collection. Crotchless trousers, corsets and chokers in shades of nude and taupe were belted tightly around loose jumpers and dresses, resembling surgical supports or restraining garments. Twisted patent leather belts featured on almost every look, reflecting the unhinged inspiration behind her collection. It's no surprise Lady Gaga has reportedly requested some pieces. Baggy fluffy jumper bodies were cinched with surgical support garments . A transparent tailored dress is given shape by a flesh-coloured belted corset with shoulder straps . A waspie is attached to the neck, fastened over a fluffy long-sleeved mini dress . A bright young Central St. Martins College graduate and an Alexander McQueen intern last summer, Hoermanseder wasn't afraid to push boundaries. Other looks from her collection included a waspie with a . strap attached to  a model's neck, fastened over a fluffy long-sleeved . mini skirt, as well as transparent tailored dress cinched in by a flesh-coloured belted corset with shoulder straps, resembling armour. 'I want to stir up the fashion industry with my creations but also earn respect as I pour my heart and soul into my work,' she says. She says bodies, extremities and prostheses are her inspiration.

A neck brace worn as a choker or scarf (left) and the bottomless chaps which look like surgical support garments (right) Hoermanseder describes herself as a handcrafter, who is sleepless until her pieces are finished. In her latest offering, the parallels to her role model McQueen are clear. 'He developed his first drafts during sleepless nights in a garage in East London. I often think about that when I am colouring thousand metres of leather edges in my kitchen.' Last season's collection was very similar. 'I . wanted to design a collection that gave women support, that literally . helped them stand taller, stronger. Many of my leather pieces are fully . studded, I also moulded the corsets by wetting and twisting the leather . to accentuate the spine curvatures,' she told a website at the time. Fashion designer Marina Hoermanseder, centre, acknowledges the audience next to models presenting creations today . Meanwhile, Miranda Konstantinidou presented her collection full of colourfully weaved dresses and bug-eyed glasses. The designer is constantly developing new production techniques by combining traditional and modern assembly methods and experimenting with unusual combinations of materials. This season, she opted for statement jewellery and woven headscarves to complement her eclectic, almost tribal range.

"By . Neil Moxley . Click here to read our chief sports writer's debate column on Anelka's nasty strain of anti-Semitic Nazi posturing . Sponsors Zoopla have told West Bromwich Albion to axe Nicolas Anelka or lose their £3million deal. The former France striker should know early next week whether the FA will charge him over the quenelle gesture he made after scoring against West Ham three weeks ago. Albion fear he could be handed a lengthy ban and have called on the FA to speed up their investigation. Gesture: Anelka is to discover his fate after an FA investigation into his goal celebration at West Ham . Controversy: The quenelle is a gesture linked with anti-Semitism back in Anelka's French homeland . But, according to a report in Marketing Week, the property portal has contacted the club to voice their dissatisfaction following Anelka’s actions, which some say carry anti-Semitic overtures. Zoopla, owned by Jewish businessman Alex Chesterman, say Anelka must be dropped for Monday night’s game against Everton and have told the club they will want their name removed from the club’s shirts immediately if he plays. A club spokesman said: ‘West Bromwich Albion will be making no further comment until the Football Association have concluded their investigation, and the club their own internal enquiry, into the matter.’ Back in action: Anelka featured in West Brom's last game - away at Southampton . Bittersweet: Anelka performed the salute after scoring the first of two goals in a 3-3 draw with West Ham . Albion had played down the issue and kept the 34-year-old striker in their side. But they are aware of the arguments around the incident and are conscious of the club’s image. One Jewish Albion fan said: ‘I want to support the club I love, but their refusal to issue a real apology or remove Anelka from first-team selection makes that somewhat difficult.’ If Anelka does receive a long ban, it would cast a shadow over his Albion career. Signed by former manager Steve Clarke in the summer, he got off to a troubled start when he announced he planned to quit the game following the sudden death of close friend Eric Manasse. Though Clarke convinced him to play on, Anelka struggled for form, then suffered a series of injuries. National outrage: The quenelle was popularised by Anelka's 'friend', French comedian Dieudonne. Here, anti-Dieudonne protesters converge on Paris in opposition against the controversial figure . Friends: The then-West Brom acting head coach Keith . Downing says that the gesture was a dedication from Anelka (right) to . his French comedian friend Dieudonne (left), which Anelka reiterated on . Twitter . Zoopla.co.uk is a property website and is part of the Zoopla Property Group Ltd, a privately held company whose shareholders include DMG Media, a division of DMGT plc, the company which owns the Daily Mail. Mamadou Sakho . The Liverpool defender was pictured twice doing the gesture, once with Dieudonne, lastmonth. But he later said he did not know what it meant and had been ‘tricked’. Yannick Sagbo . The Hull forward tweeted a picture of Anelka’s celebration and wrote: ‘Anelka is a legend i love him is a best french striker’ and included a message of support for Dieudonne. The website’s two-year deal is due to run . out this summer and no announcement has been made about a renewal. The . latest problems almost certainly leave the club looking for a new backer . for next season, if not before. The authorities have to consider the legalities of the Frenchman’s latest predicament and the club’s sporting and technical director Richard Garlick has asked the FA to come up with a decision quickly. He said: ‘It would help everyone for the investigation to be over as soon as possible. The FA have given a statement about how quickly they would do that.’ Anelka could be short of firepower without Anelka, having sold Shane Long to Hull City yesterday. However, the club have confirmed they will not be spending during the transfer window. ‘We have a number of strikers who have emerged, including Saido Berahino,’ said Garlick. ‘If we need to get a short-term deal to solve any striking issue, then we will try to do that. ‘We have a good selection of strikers. They have all trained this week.’ Controversial: This picture of Samir Nasri (left) apparently performing the 'quenelle' was on social media sites .

"By . Sara Malm . The religious leader of Iran has banned online chatting between men and women who are not related, pulling the rug from under the feet of singletons trying to find love on the internet. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei published a fatwa against the practice - on his own website - branding it 'immoral'.

Days earlier, Iranian authorities blocked WeChat, an app similar to WhatsApp with more than 100million users that enables access to social networks. Both Facebook and Twitter, as well as other social networks, are banned in Iran. Despite this ban, many Teheran officials have both Facebook and Twitter accounts, including President Hassan Rowhani who has 163,000 followers on Twitter.

"By . Damien Gayle . The destruction of Brazil's Amazon rainforest has slowed to its lowest level since monitoring began, it was announced yesterday. Satellite images showed that 1,798 square miles of the Amazon were slashed and burned between August 2011 and July 2012, said Brazil's environment minister Izabella Teixeira. That's 27 per cent less than the 2,478 square miles cut down a year earlier. Scroll down for video . Smoke billows as flames burn trees in the Amazon rainforest: Brazil today announced that the rate of deforestation in the Amazon has fallen to its lowest levels since records began . Brazil's National Institute for Space Research said the rate of deforestation is the lowest since it started taking measurements in 1988. The Amazon constitutes more than half of the planet's remaining rainforest, and it is also the largest and most species-rich tract of tropical rainforest in the world. Brazil contains 63 per cent of the vast rainforest's 2.4million square miles. The space institute said the latest figures show Brazil is close to its 2020 target of reducing deforestation by 80 per cent from 1990 levels. Through to July 2012 rates of deforestation have dropped by 76.26 per cent. George Pinto a director of Ibama, Brazil's environmental protection agency, said stricter enforcement of environmental laws and improved surveillance technology are behind the drop in deforestation levels. Virgin Amazon jungle in Mato Grosso State, one of the Brazilian states of greatest deforestation: The Amazon constitutes more than half of the planet's remaining rainforest and is home to a huge range of species . The destruction of the Amazon began in earnest in the Sixties with farmers slashing and burning forests to make space for crop cultivation. Colonists found soils were only productive for a limited time, spurring them to clear more and more forest and causing widespread environmental damage. However, even before the introduction of large scale agriculture, humans have long had an impact on the Amazon basin. Archaeological evidence suggests the first inhabitants settled the region at least 11,200 years ago, and by 1500AD some 5million people may have lived in the region. Francisco de Orellana, the first European to travel along the Amazon river, reported a complex civilisation flourishing on its banks in the 1540s. Other evidence suggests the forests, rather than being pristine wilderness, have in fact been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices like forest gardening. Terra preta (black earth), which is distributed over large areas in the Amazon, is now widely accepted as a product of soil management indicating portions of the forest are the result of centuries of human shaping. It is thought many of the region's original indigenous inhabitants were wiped out by the spread of diseases like smallpox carried by European explorers. Mr Pinto said that in the 12-month period a total of 2,000 square meters of illegally felled timber were seized by government agents. The impounded lumber is sold in auctions and the money obtained is invested in environmental preservation programs. Ms Teixeira said Brazil will next year start using satellite monitoring technology to detect illegal logging and slash-and-burn activity and issue fines. Adalberto Verissimo, a senior researcher at Imazon, an environmental watchdog agency, said: 'Over the past several years Brazil has made a huge effort to contain deforestation and the latest figures testify to its success. 'The deforestation figures are extremely positive, for they point to a consistent downward trend.' 'The numbers disprove the argument that deforestation is necessary for the country's economy to grow', he said by telephone from his office in the Amazon city of Belem. 'Deforestation has been dropping steadily for the past four years while the economy has grown,' he said . 'But the war is far from over. We still have a lot of battles to fight and win.' Marcio Astrini, Greenpeace coordinator in the Amazon region, said the lower figures show that reducing deforestation is perfectly possible. But he added that 'the numbers are still too high for a country that does not have to destroy one single hectare in order to develop.'","Rate of deforestation has fallen by 27 per cent in the year to July compared with previous 12 months .

"By . Ruth Styles . With a kitchen crammed with Tupperware and a penchant for recycling outfits, the Queen is no stranger to thrifty living. And it appears that the monarch has found another way to keep costs down - by eschewing expensive scented candles and scenting Buckingham Palace using reed diffusers instead. Photos of the Queen's audiences with David Cameron reveal the presence of the diffusers, tucked away on a sideboard between porcelain ornaments and potted plants. Photos of the Queen's audiences with David Cameron reveal the presence of the diffusers . The diffusers, which use rattan reeds to disperse the fragrance of essential oils or perfume, last for up to four months - significantly longer than candles, which on average, burn for just 60 hours. 'Unfortunately, it's impossible to tell the brand that the Queen is using as the branding appears to have been removed,' explains perfume expert Lawrence Roullier White. 'But I'd like to think the perfect scent for her would be 'Sweet William' by British brand Urban Apothecary London.' He added: 'While diffusers are a luxury, Her Majesty is being quite canny financially as the average scented candle will burn for 60 hrs while reed diffusers can last up to four months.' Reed diffusers are becoming an increasingly popular way to scent the home thanks to their convenience and the ability to provide a constant source of fresh fragrance. They also dispense with the need for flame and matches, something that Roullier White believes the new great-grandmother would appreciate. 'There's is no need for a naked flame,' he explains. 'I suspect that this is why Her Majesty has chosen a reed diffuser to scent her drawing room - there are a lot of papers on her desk and she obviously feels more comfortable. 'She's probably more sensitive to fire after the blaze at Windsor Castle during her annus horribilis.' While . it's not hard to find diffusers with price tags large enough to make a . dent in even the most regal of bank balances, there are some more . affordable options around - not least Air Wick's cheap and cheerful . £6.99 offering.

"By . Jonathan Petre . A growing number of schools are ditching traditional Christian assemblies in favour of reflections on topics such as iPhones, Oprah Winfrey and Stevie Wonder, a Mail on Sunday investigation has found. Up to 270 primary and secondary schools have been allowed to opt out of the legal requirement to provide a daily act of ‘broadly Christian’ collective worship – up from about 230 five years ago. Documents obtained from local authorities under Freedom of Information (FOI) laws show that one secondary school, Acton High School in Ealing, included the ‘birth of the iPhone’, to highlight ‘communications’. A growing number of schools are ditching traditional Christian assemblies in favour of reflections on topics such as iPhones, Oprah Winfrey  and Stevie Wonder . Traditionalists attacked the trend for robbing children of their understanding of a vital element of Britain’s heritage. Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘It is the birthright of children in this country to become familiar with its identity – including its religious identity – which is, broadly speaking, Christian. ‘Moving from the nativity  of Christ to the nativity of  the iPhone shows the extent to which assemblies have become degraded.’ But Acton High School head Andy . Sievewright said only a quarter of his pupils were from a Christian . background, so the school did not have ‘a specifically Christian focus’. Another Ealing school, Featherstone . High, last year used assemblies to mark International DayAgainst . Homophobia and International Women’s Day, highlighting figures such as . US First Lady Michelle Obama and television host Oprah Winfrey. Steve Jobs launches the first iPhone in 2007, a topic deemed fit for discussion at one school's assembly . Head Gerry Wadwa said only about seven per cent of  his pupils saw themselves as Christians. He added: ‘Our assemblies provide time and space for a reflection on a range of spiritual, moral, social and cultural issues.’ One school in North London, Norbury Primary, gave an example of an assembly during which the lyrics of the Stevie Wonder song Happy Birthday were explored. A council spokesman said the song had been chosen for Martin Luther King Day because it had been composed to mark his birthday. Schools have had to provide a daily act of Christian worship since the 1944 Education Act. But they can apply for an exemption to the local authority’s Standing Advisory Council for Religious Education, made up of school and faith representatives. Most of the schools which apply have a large number of ethnic minority pupils, and in  a few cases parents have threatened to withdraw their children from Christian- based worship. All 152 English councils were sent FOI requests, of which 110 said a total of 195 schools had opted out – which would be nearly 270 if extrapolated across the country. Colin Hart, director of the Christian Institute, said that  in an attempt not to ‘upset anyone’, children were receiving an ‘appalling mishmash’ at assemblies. He said: ‘You hear some of the things that children do in collective worship, such as  I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles being sung in primary school, and you have to ask, where is the relevance?’ But councillor Susan Hall, leader of Harrow Council, said: ‘A school assembly can tackle ethical issues without religious context, and examples or issues from the everyday world can be  used to make serious  points about morality  and society.’","Up to 270 schools have been allowed to opt out of the requirement to provide a daily act of 'broadly Christian' collective worship .

"By . Meghan Keneally . and Louise Boyle . Robert Wilson committed suicide in December and now details of his will have been released, showing he left $2million to his assistant and millions to the executor of his will. The 87-year-old hedge funder-turned-philanthropist's health was deteriorating and had recently suffered a stroke which limited his mobility. He was found dead on December 23 after having jumped from his 16th floor apartment in the historic San Remo building on Manhattan's Upper West Side which is known for its unparalleled views of Central Park. Today it was revealed that in addition to environmental and educational charities, he also left his 72-year-old assistant Angela Riccardi $2million and gave an undisclosed amount to Richard Schneidman who was a longtime friend and put in charge of executing his will. After taxes, Mr Schneidman's gift is expected to be multiple millions. Planned: Robert W. Wilson deliberately gave hundreds of millions of dollars of his fortune away in the years before his death on December 23 and told friends he wanted to have it all gone when he died . The New York Daily News reported that . the openly gay octogenarian did not leave any money to his ex-wife, who . he divorced nearly 40 years ago. 'He . left huge amounts of money to charity... He was a good friend for 30 . years. I’m devastated,' Mr Schneidman told The Daily News. Neighbor David Tobey told the New York Post: 'Robert, for all his money, never took cabs, never took a limo. He always took the subway. 'On the few occasions when he did grab a cab, he would usually share a cab with someone in the building. He shared a cab with my wife and insisted that she pay half.' Wilson had a personal fortune of about $800million - but he recently told friends he had given all but $100million to charity. He apparently could not give away the rest because it was tied up in long-term investments. A police source told the Post that he had left a suicide note which read: 'I had a rewarding life. Thank you and goodbye to all my friends. Please make sure you cancel all my plans. Tell everyone what I did. I’m not ashamed of killing myself. Sell all my stuff.' Friends saw signs that he may do something drastic as he suffered a debilitating stroke about a month ago and began unloading his fortune in droves. The multi-millionaire did not have any children and his 35-year marriage ended well before his death. Home: Wilson had owned his 16th floor apartment in the historic San Remo building since 1978 and he jumped off the balcony to his death on Monday . The paper reports that he has donated more than $100million a piece to four different charities: The Nature conservancy, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Wildlife Conservation Society and the World Monuments Fund. 'He was the most committed person I have ever known,' World Monuments Fund president Bonnie Burnham said to The Post. 'More than his financial contributions, he brought an astute mind and sharp wit to the organization. He will be missed greatly and long remembered as a visionary donor.' The idea of saving the environment was one that Wilson had spoken about previously, and in a 2011 interview, he told The Financial Times that much of the $600million he had given to charity at that point was directed towards those groups. 'The idea of ""But for my money, it would be gone forever"" appeals,' he said then at the age of 84. Another issue that appealed to him - and was close to his purse strings- was an investment in New York City's Catholic schools even though he was an atheist. The felt that the tuition at the schools, which were going through financial issues, showed an immediate 'return' and he gave $20million to a fund earmarked for that cause. 'I’m an atheist, but I think the schools are especially good,' he said to the Financial Times. Before the stroke: Wilson, seen here in his colorfully-decorated apartment in 2010, donated hundreds of millions of dollars to environmental and educational causes . He was also proud of the apartment where he lived, making it less of a shock that he chose that as his final resting place. He had owned the apartment since 1978 and his attention to detail and fine art collection has helped him decorate it and refurbish it so that his original price- $300,000- is just a fraction of what he estimated it's worth in 2011- $20million. Wilson is one of many millionaires who live in the building, as Bono, Tiger Woods, Steven Spielberg, Dodi Fayed and Bruce Willis have all had apartments in the building. The apartment has views of Central Park, and Wilson clearly relished looking out at the trees and the lake. 'Who needs a summer place? I've got one,' he said to the Financial Times reporter.

"By . Claire Bates . We all know how irritating it can be when you can't get a tune out of your head. But one women suffers from such vivid audio hallucinations she has to start vacuum cleaning to escape them. Cath Gamester, 84, has musical ear syndrome which means she hears half a dozen songs on a constant loop as if they are being played in the room. When she first started suffering from the condition in 2010, the pensioner thought a noisy neighbour was to blame. Cath Gamester had musical ear syndrome, which means she hears carols and hymns as if they are being played in the room . 'When I woke up in the morning I heard music and it was ""God save the Queen"". I thought it was next door because it was going on and on,' she said. But although the mixture of Christmas carols, popular tunes and hymns sound incredibly real, they are actually being produced by her brain. The playlist, which includes Silent . Night, Abide with Me, You'll Never Walk Alone, Land of Hope and Glory, . has been repeating ever since. Cath takes to vacuuming to block out the noise of her condition . 'The . song Happy Birthday - every few minutes I'm wishing someone happy . birthday - I hate that one!' she told BBC's Inside Out North-West. Luckily she does at least like the singer. 'It's a tenor, a man's voice and - it's a nice voice, very strong and loud and there's a background of music,' she explained. The grandmother from Liverpool is not the only sufferer . but it is a very rare condition affecting just one in 10,000 people aged over 65. Mrs Gamester said she developed the condition . after taking anti-depressant to deal with the death of her sister Mary. She . stopped taking the pills but the songs continued. Psychiatrist Dr Nick Warner, said he . came across it a number of times among elderly patients at his former GP . practice in Wales. He said that unlike tinnitus is has nothing to do . with problems in the ear. He added: 'We found that an awful lot of people . who had hymns and Christmas carols. Particularly the hymn abide with me . came up again and again - about a 50 per cent chance. 'It's quite a reassuring hymn. You . have got to wonder if there is something generating this need for . reassurance when you're getting older. That you're not alone and that . you're safe.' However, other researchers have . speculated about whether it is the brain responding to a decline in . hearing by plugging the gap with music well-known to the sufferer. Mrs Gamester has advised those who suffer from the same syndrome to try and get on with enjoying life . German composer Robert Schumann who lived in the early 19th century suffered auditory hallucinations . The Romantic composer Robert Schumann was said to have had the condition and reported hearing an 'angelic choir' singing to him. Unfortunately there is no cure for the condition, although Dr Warner says sufferers could help themselves by talking about it, distracting themselves, socialising more and listening to different music. Mrs Gamester resorted to vacuuming, singing at the top of her voice and getting angry and telling the music to 'shut up.' However, over time she has found a way to make peace with the condition. She decided to speak out about her condition to help overcome the stigma that is attached to 'hearing things'. People with mental illnesses such as schizophrenia can suffer from psychiatric auditory hallucinations. These tend to be voices rather than music and are perceived to be talking to or about the sufferer. Those with musical ear syndrome experience non-psychiatric auditory hallucinations - that is music or words that aren't particularly meaningful to them. Mrs Gamester said: 'I say to the poor people who are . like me, don't worry about it too much, get on with life and enjoy . yourself as much as you can and be happy.' The BBC Inside Out episode featuring Cath Gamester is available to view on BBC iPlayer until Sunday 23rd December .","Cath Gamester first started hearing music in 2010 and assumed it was a noisy neighbour .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Glamour model turned bodybuilder Jodie Marsh who received up to five vile letters and pictures a week from her 'stalker' Joseph Mafwenke. Jodie Marsh was left fearing for her life after a deluded stalker bombarded her with bizarre letters and pictures of his penis, a court was told. Joseph Mafwenke, 38, allegedly sent up to five 'disgusting' letters a week to the glamour model turned bodybuilder's home address in Brentwood, Essex. Mafwenke’s bizarre campaign included sending Miss Marsh, 35, photoshopped pictures of the couple having intercourse and of them walking hand in hand. Miss Marsh told Basildon Crown Court the  'stalking' was so relentless, she feared she could have been kidnapped, raped or even murdered. Mafwenke would send up to five letters and pictures every week - some by recorded delivery - for almost a year, jurors were told. Miss Marsh eventually moved house to escape the man's relentless campaign. Mafwenke was arrested when the television personality saw him standing outside her old house when she returned to visit family. Miss Marsh told the court she recognised her alleged stalker - who also told Miss Marsh he wanted to have four children with her - from the photos he had sent. Mafwenke, of Crawley, West Sussex, has denied a single charge of stalking Miss Marsh. Mafwenke sat in the dock alongside his Swahili interpreter as the court was told a Zoo magazine article featuring Miss Marsh had inspired his actions. Miss Marsh took to the witness stand to give evidence from behind screens so she would not have to face the defendant. At one point she broke down in tears as she was confronted with the letters . She said: 'Straight away, I knew it was not normal fan mail, the letters would say things like ""you will be my wife"", ""we will be together"", ""you will have four children"", ""we are meant to be together"". 'The way it was said, it was like it was a given that it would happen.' Miss Marsh said the letters, which included pictures of a naked Mafwenke on top of her, left her 'really scared'. Miss Marsh said she 'feared for her life' when she received the letters - some of which had been photoshopped to show her having sex with Mafwenke. The man also sent her pictures of his penis, jurors heard . The former glamour model, who is now a bodybuilder, said she initially told police not to take any action in case it 'tipped Mafwenke over the edge.' He would send up to five letters a week to Miss Marsh the court heard . She had also been sent 'weird drawings' in which her name and that of the defendant had been intertwined. The court heard Mafwenke also made 'calculations' using his date of birth and Miss Marsh’s to work out whether they would be happy together. She added: 'He would send photos of himself, at first he was fully clothed then the photos turned explicit and he sent pictures of himself naked and photos of his penis and erect penis. 'That was really upsetting. It was really disgusting - not something that I would want to see. Miss Marsh in a 'no make-up selfie'. Mafwenke sent the bodybuilder letters saying he 'loved her' and 'wanted to have four children' with her . 'I was left nervous, thinking about what he might do in the future I was worried that he was mentally unstable' She told jurors she had initially asked police not to take any action in case it tipped Mafwenke over the edge. Asked by prosecutor Julia Faure Walker what she feared could happen, Miss Marsh said: 'I thought it might be rape, murder, kidnap. In my line of work, you don’t think anything is too far-fetched.' The court heard the frequency of letters increased to up to five per week with the mail being sent by recorded delivery. One letter said: 'I love you and the way you are alone..I plan to have four babies with you in married life. Thank you for I make it happen. [sic] . Another said: 'Our time is now to have our childrens'. [sic] . Talking about the letters, Miss Marsh said: 'I honestly thought he was deluded. I did not think he was mentally stable.' The glamour model turned bodybuilder said she felt obliged to go and collect missed letters from the sorting office in case they were work-related documents. Miss Faure Walker asked her: 'Did you ever respond in any way to these letters? Miss Marsh replied: 'No. I knew it was not right to respond.' Some of the letters were thrown away but many were kept as evidence and were seen by the jury. Miss Faure Walker told the jury that Mafwenke’s 'fascination' with Miss Marsh began after he saw an article in Zoo magazine. Miss Marsh during filming of 'Bullied: My Secret Past'. The court was told the man was inspired to send letters to the television personality after seeing her in a Zoo magazine article . She said: 'He was responding to an article in Zoo magazine. He interpreted it that Miss Marsh wanted a boyfriend and he would contact her to that end.' In August 2012 she started receiving the first of the letters and 'felt troubled' by their content. 'This . was not ordinary fan mail. There were photos of himself and sometimes . he superimposed pictures of himself next to Miss Marsh as well. He then started sending photos of his erect penis to her. 'Initially, the defendant would send normal letters by post but then he started sending them by recorded delivery.' Miss Faure Walker warned the jurors that they would be seeing sexually explicit images. She added: 'There are photos of the defendant’s penis which he took it upon himself to send to her. When questioned in court Miss Marsh, pictured in training, said she never responded to any of the messages . 'You may want to think what your reaction would have been if you had not been warned of the content. 'How would you feel if they had been sent to your home address?' She said the defendant should have known his course of conduct would cause harassment or distress. The trial heard that Miss Marsh did report the matters to police - but asked them just to place her concerns on record and not to approach Mafwenke, fearful of how he would react. Mafwenke, who appeared in the dock wearing a black and white striped shirt and grey trousers, pleaded not guilty at an earlier hearing to stalking Miss Marsh. The trial, expected to last two days, continues. Mafwenke, who was arrested outside Miss Marsh's Brentwood home, denies a single charge of stalking at Basildon Crown Court, pictured.

"By . Sam Webb . An Army driver is facing jail after he was found guilty of killing a teenage biker during an illicit 'Fast and Furious-style' street car rally for petrol-heads. Gareth Jones, 23, was attending a 'car cruising club' organised on Facebook in which vehicles were raced at speeds of up to 130mph on a remote road next to an industrial estate. Tragedy struck when he pulled a 'sudden and dangerous' left turn while driving his Ford Focus ST and veered into the path of 19-year-old Jack Bellis who was riding a yellow Suzuki dRZ 400 motorbike. Army driver Gareth Jones (left) is facing jail after he was found guilty of killing a teenage biker Jack Bellis (right) during an illicit 'Fast and Furious-style' racing rally on a remote road in Runcorn, Cheshire . The youngster, who was also driving at high speed, stood no chance of avoiding a crash and smashed headlong into the passenger side of the Focus. He suffered multiple injuries and died in hospital the following afternoon. Serving soldier Jones, from Widnes, Cheshire, who was on leave at the time of the crash in October 2012, had passed every military driving qualification suitable to his rank. At Chester Crown Court he was convicted of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving by a jury but was cleared of the more serious charge of causing death by dangerous driving. The jury was told the fatal crash happened in Runcorn after the boy racer type meeting like those featured in the Hollywood movies starring Vin Diesel after it was advertised on the social media network. Witnesses reported seeing cars in 'rolling races', travelling at speeds estimated at 130mph in the 40mph zone. Performance: The Ford Focus ST Jones was driving during the accident . One witness had reported seeing two cars, which were not involved in the crash, racing side by side just minutes before the collision. Another witness, Christopher Filkins, saw Mr Bellis, from Padgate, Warrington riding on his bike at speeds estimated between 80 to 100 mph. He said: 'Jack was flying up and down the road. I had my back to the road but every time he came into view I would have a quick look.' The rider had completed two laps before deciding to go home. He had not been racing other cars but was simply 'showing off'. Loss: Floral tributes at the scene of the accident where Jack Bellis died . Peter Hussey, prosecuting, said: 'Being a remote area, being away from ordinary motorists and police, young drivers wanted to show off their vehicles, show off the speed of their vehicles, and try their racing prowess out against each other. 'Clearly, and I don’t shirk from this, Jack Bellis was there to join the event.' He said racers were 'performing to an audience' with people watching from grass verges, and that Jones was guilty of 'deliberate risk taking'. Mr Bellis' bike was following Jones’ 'performance car' in single file, on one side of the public road. The soldier appeared to be crossing into the centre of the road as if he was going to park on the other side of the road. But he then suddenly changed his mind and began to turn left into the mouth of a side road - and into the path of the teenager. After the crash Jones got out of the car in a state of shock, saying ‘I didn’t see him’. He passed a breath test. A tribute to Mr Bellis, who was described as an 'excellent and safe rider' Jones denied both charges and said the victim was to blame for the crash. He said he had slowed down and indicated before attempting a U-turn. But Judge Thomas Teague QC told him: 'I take the view that this falls into the highest category of cases of driving without due care and attention, those that are described as falling just short of causing death by dangerous driving. 'It is as close as it gets, in my opinion - and think it falls into the most serious category of that offence. 'That means you must expect an immediate custodial sentence. This is a very serious case.' Jones, who has been in the Army since 2007 was said by his chief commanding officer to be of 'sound judgement at all times'. The court heard he was a 'committed soldier' who was tipped for promotion after setting a 'good example to his comrades'. He will be sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court on April 16. He as released on unconditional bail and given an interim driving ban. Mr Bellis was a keen angler had won an Associate Rider of the Year award with Warrington Advance Motorcyclists. A scheme has been set up in his memory to help bikers complete a ‘Skill For Life’ course. Geoff Kelly, a senior observer with the group, said: 'Jack was an excellent and safe rider. I told Jack that I wouldn’t be happy with him until he had done a 100 per cent perfect ride. He did it eventually on his 13th run - the morning of his test. 'To take all that in and come out on top, at such a young age, was truly exceptional.'","Soldier Gareth Jones collided with Jack Bellis on remote road .

"By . Mark Duell . More than 100 pigs have been blown up in Britain over a three-year period for research into battlefield injuries, it was revealed today. Some 115 have been killed to test if they could be saved after being injured in blasts - and a group were even put in body armour before being blown up at a military base in Porton Down, Wiltshire. Animal rights groups say the exercises are ‘impossible to justify medically, ethically or educationally’, but the Ministry of Defence insists they help develop treatments that have saved lives in warfare. Scroll down for video . Tests: Live pigs strung up as targets moments before being shot during a course in Jaegerspris, Denmark . Training: The Ministry of Defence has defended its involvement in the 'cruel' practice of blowing up pigs . The figures emerged in Freedom of Information requests by the Daily Mirror, after it was revealed British military were taking part in twice-yearly training courses nicknamed Operation Danish Bacon. Some . 21 pigs were blown up in 2010, 37 in 2011 and 57 in 2012 - and animal . welfare group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) has . urged the military to stop the practice now. The . group said that more than 80 per cent of Britain’s allies in the North . Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) - including 20 EU member states - no . longer train military medical personnel using animals. A . spokesman told MailOnline: ‘To shoot, stab or blow up live pigs in . order to train our military medics makes as much sense as conducting . modern warfare with muskets. ‘Vastly . superior non-animal trauma training methods, including life-like . human-patient simulators, are available and used by the militaries of 23 . of the UK's 27 Nato allies. ‘It's . time for the military to end its participation in these inhumane and . ill-conceived exercises for the sake of both our fighting forces and . animals.’ Animal cruelty? Military surgeons who serve in the British Forces taking part in controversial medical training . Carted away: Some 21 pigs were blown up in 2010, 37 in 2011 and 57 in 2012, figures have revealed . The 2010 pigs were blown up to see if they could be saved after suffering ‘severe battlefield trauma’, while the 2011 pigs were being tested for the effectiveness of blood clotting products. Tests on those killed in 2012 were for finding out more about both methods, reported the Mirror's Martin Bagot. 'To shoot, stab or blow up live pigs in order to train our military medics makes as much sense as conducting modern warfare with muskets' People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals spokesman . But the MoD believes the practice is vital for safe and effective treatments and pre-treatments for biological and chemical agents, and developing methods that have saved lives in Afghanistan. The exercises are also said to have developed a safe treatment for botulism for the armed forces – which has also been used in civilian cases of the infection in Britain and abroad. A MoD spokesman said: ‘The research we undertake saves lives. It develops world class protective equipment for our troops as well as advances in medical treatment that have benefited those injured on the battlefield as well as civilians. ‘Countering the threat posed by chemical and biological weapons and improving the treatment of casualties on the battlefield cannot currently be achieved without the use of animals. Row: Peta said that more than 80 per cent of Britain's allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - including 20 EU member states - no longer train military medical personnel using animals . Research: Some pigs were even put in body armour before being blown up at a military base in Porton Down, Wiltshire (pictured) ‘We are increasingly using computer modelling and cell cultures to reduce the need for testing on animals. We are committed to increasing this and developing further alternatives.’ 'Countering the threat posed by chemical and biological weapons and improving the treatment of casualties on the battlefield cannot currently be achieved without the use of animals' Ministry of Defence spokesman . The MoD has killed 28,000 animals in various tests over the last three years, and the use of animals in military experiments in Britain is legal. Peta UK obtained photographs last month of pigs being shot with an AK-47 assault rifle or a 9mm handgun in experiments attended by surgeons serving in Britain’s Armed Forces in Denmark. During these experiments, sedatives are first mixed into the pigs’ food. When they fall asleep they are anaesthetised by a vet. The animals are then taken to a shooting range, where marksmen try to ensure that their shots injure but do not kill. The pigs are then placed on a stretcher – just as a human casualty would be – while medics use dressings to stem blood loss before a waiting team of surgeons operates.","115 pigs killed in 3 years to test if they could be saved after being injured .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Two screenwriters have accused the creators of Fox hit show 'New Girl', which debuted in 2011, of ripping off a television pilot script they had shopped around for about three years. Stephanie Counts and Shari Gold claim the popular sitcom plagiarizes their script work in 'Square One', which was allegedly based on Counts' real-life experiences. In a lawsuit filed in California federal court on Thursday, the women have demanded an injunction that halts further filming and distribution of the comedy series starring actress Zooey Deschanel. The plaintiffs - Stephanie Counts and Shari Gold . Suing: Stephanie Counts (left) and Shari Gold (right) claim Fox comedy show 'New Girl' was ripped off from their television pilot script, 'Square One' 'Any differences between the Square One scripts and New Girl are so small and insignificant that they cannot be afforded copyright protection, and are, in fact, nothing more than transparent attempts to hide Defendants’ blatant plagiarism,' the writers claim in the 92-page complaint, obtained by Hollywood Reporter. 'These differences are more akin to eraser marks or ink blots on Stephanie and Shari’s creation and cannot be treated as original expression.' The screenwriters, who met each other as journalism students at the University of Georgia in the 1990s, are suing 'New Girl' creator Elizabeth Meriwether, Peter Chernin, Jacob Kasdan, Fox and WME. The lengthy lawsuit alleges that the women based the original script on 'Stephanie’s real-life experience when she discovered her husband was . having an affair, leading her to move into a three-man bachelor pad'. Counts claims she had moved in with her brother, a . Hollywood stuntman, and two of his friends in Culver City. During this . time, she took notes, which reportedly inspired the 'Square One' script.

The lawsuit claims independent producer, Holly Harter, reviewed the script and advised the writers it would work better as a film. The women allegedly shopped around a rewrite in 2006. The complaint says that, in 2008, Harter emailed Counts that she had sent a solicited copy to WME partner Adam Venit. The script was then allegedly shopped by the talent agency to directors. A year later, Counts and Gold claim they suggested to Harter that Deschanel be a potential lead, but Harter didn't know who the the actress was. Unhappy that the show hadn't been picked up despite interest from WME, the duo dumped Harter. The women claim that's when WME's attitudes towards them changed and they had trouble getting their calls returned. The lawsuit claims the women found out in 2011 that their work appeared to be poached, with authorship of the . series credited to Elizabeth Meriwether, a WME client. Among the defendants: 'New Girl' creators and producers . Elizabeth Meriwether . Peter Chernin . Jake Kasdan . The screenwriters claim their script was passed on to Meriwether and industry luminary .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Lee Roberts, 34, of Leicester, East Midlands, pictured outside Leicester Crown Court, is accused of causing death by dangerous driving in September 2012 . A van driver killed a motorcyclist when he lost control of his vehicle after scoffing five sandwiches at the wheel, a court heard. Landscape gardener Lee Roberts ploughed into oncoming motorcyclist Clifford Marston, who died at the scene, a jury was told. Roberts’ transit van also collided with two approaching cars, injuring an 80-year-old woman, who has been left paralysed. The 34-year-old is said to have veered onto the wrong side of the road while eating his fifth sandwich in a journey of just two miles. Roberts, of Leicester, East Midlands, denies causing the death by dangerous driving of Mr Marston, 66, on 14 September 2012. Leicester Crown Court heard the tragedy happened at around 11am on the A6006 Asfordby Road in Leicester. Minutes earlier Roberts had stopped to buy fuel and sandwiches - a ‘breakfast triple’ pack and a double pack of egg mayonnaise - at a Texaco garage. At the crash scene, he is alleged to have told witnesses he choked on a sandwich and let go of the steering wheel while trying to unblock his airway. However, he later said in a police interview he had finished eating before the accident, and claimed it was caused when he suddenly blacked out. Jonathan Straw, prosecuting, said Roberts’ van veered onto the wrong side of the road and hit a Ford Focus, but did not injure the driver or passenger. Mr Straw added: ‘It carried on and struck Mr Marston’s motorbike head-on, before colliding with a following Honda Civic. ‘The question is, why did his van move in that way?’ Mr Straw alleged that Roberts had consumed virtually all his five sandwiches during the 2.2 mile journey, as police later found only a corner of one in his van. He added: ‘He told people at the accident he’d started choking on a sandwich and it caused him to lose control, veer and crash. ‘But later he said, no, he’d finished eating before he left Melton, but had had a tightening of the chest and an unforeseen fainting or blacking out, caused him to lose awareness and he lost control. Lee Roberts, pictured with his mobile phone outside Leicester Crown Court, denies causing the death by dangerous driving of Mr Marston, 66, on the A6006 in September 2012 . ‘We say he wasn’t in proper control of his vehicle and wasn’t taking proper care, if he was combining the acts of driving and eating in that way.’ Yesterday, jurors watched a video of the route taken by Roberts. It took a police driver around eight-and-a-half minutes to complete the journey between the petrol station and crash site. The court was also shown footage taken in the back of a police car after the crash of Roberts being quizzed by one of the first officers on the scene. He told PC Tom Pearson: ‘I had finished my sandwich. It was already swallowed. ‘But it felt like it had come back up for some reason. I could feel it stuck in my chest. ‘There was a loud pitch in my ears and my sight went completely black. My chest muscles tightened and I could not move my feet on the brakes. I could not do anything. There was a bang.’ Terry Hall, the driver of the Ford Focus which was struck first, said in a statement read to the jury: ‘All of a sudden I saw a van bearing down on to us, on our side of the road.’ A jury at Leicester Crown Court, pictured, was told Roberts' transit van ploughed into an oncoming motorcyclist minutes after he had stopped to buy sandwiches and fuel at a nearby garage . He added: ‘It was completely out of the blue. It seemed to shoot across the road out of nowhere. I had no time to react. I heard a bang. ‘The van hit the rear of my vehicle. As I looked in the rear view mirror, I saw it plough into a gentleman on a motorbike behind. ‘The motorbike shot up into the air and the poor chap was thrown onto the grass verge. ‘I couldn’t believe what had just happened.’ Passers-by went to the assistance of Mr Marston, of Oakham, Rutland, but were unable to save him. Roberts suffered minor injuries in the incident. The trial continues.

"By . Ashley Pearson . Getting up at 6am on a Sunday, after a night with a jet-lagged baby is certainly no picnic. However as I made my way to the BBC Big Questions studio in Mile End last weekend, I was fairly buzzing. The reason was neither the three shots of espresso I'd had nor the promise of television cameras - it was the topic I'd been asked to address. 'Is it selfish to be an older mum?' Despite my near-visceral reaction that the question is just plain silly, apparently many people still think so. A recent study showed that a staggering 70 per cent of women over the age of 55 are opposed to and uncomfortable with women having babies in their 40s. Are older mothers selfish? Or is it really MEN who are selfish, for delaying or avoiding children with long-term partners? As a new mum who had her first baby at 41, I was slightly wary and unsure what voices and opinions I might find in the BBC studio audience. The first person I met in the Green Room was a bubbly midwife in her 50s who had her own twin boys at 37.  She said: 'I think the whole idea that these women might be selfish for wanting to be mothers later in life is outrageous. They are amazing.' Unsurprisingly, with a greeting like that, I warmed to her immediately. Finding ourselves in total agreement, I spent the rest of our precious pre-show time foregoing a make-up touch up and instead asking her for advice on getting my six-month-old-baby to sleep. Columnist: Ashley Pearson had her first baby at 41 . After a rather uncomfortable rehearsal debating the merits of being a sports fan (something Peter Hitchens found utterly appalling), host Nicky Campbell kicked off the topic of older mums' egoism. He immediately sought out the opinion of a male psychologist, (this, despite there being numerous women on the panel, there specifically to address the subject). After launching into an explanation that we, as a generation of women, have been lead falsely astray by the likes of Bridget Jones, the doctor proceeded to rattle off statistics about how older mums are at higher risk for babies with genetic problems and defects. Interestingly, it was only later in the show he admitted - after a very uncomfortable prodding by the host - that he'd had his own child at 47.  No mention of the genetic problems caused by older dads then, eh? The whole debate got better from there. There was a fabulous woman called Ellie who had had her baby at 47 via IVF, and excellent comments from others on the panel and in the gallery. I was able to reiterate my long-held mantra that the worst thing you can do is to vilify and attack women who have longed to have a baby and not put it off through any factor other than the lack of finding a suitable partner with whom to have a child. Before we finished, one rather determined and dogged MP insisted on getting his comment on the subject in, despite not being particularly relevant to the topic. His point? That it would be a grave error for women watching the programme to blithely assume they will be able to have babies well into their 40s. And that while some women can have babies later in life, most can't. And that you better get on with it then, hadn't you? On that depressing note, we closed the show. Opinionated: 'I was able to reiterate my long-held mantra that the worst thing you can do is to vilify and attack women who have longed to have a baby and not put it off through any factor other than the lack of finding a suitable partner with whom to have a child' After a whirlwind morning spent with excellent minds, most far sharper than my own, I am still left with the unanswered question: does ANY thinking woman, in this day and age, really believe she has an unlimited amount of time to have a baby? And does the above exhortation - warning, threat - really need to be said? After all, study after study shows it's educated women who are leaving it until later. I would argue that these same intelligent, informed, smart women who struggle to find a partner who is a commitment-comfortable equal are very, very aware of the limitations and challenges of motherhood in one's 40s. Every single one of us knows someone intimately who was unable to have a baby because of her age or fertility limitations. Believe me, we have all had a front row seat to that particular pain. Putting it off: 'I would argue that these same intelligent, informed, smart women who struggle to find a partner who is a commitment-comfortable equal are very, very aware of the limitations and challenges of motherhood in one's 40s' It is indeed true that more women are having babies later in life than ever before. They are willing to try gruelling hormone injections, invasive procedures, bizarre diets, painful emotional rollercoasters, selecting sperm and egg donors, horrendous adoption red tape and sometimes near financial ruin. What they are not willing to do is to walk away from the dream of being a mother just because it's bloody hard. If your goal is to encourage women in their 20s to be mindful of their fertility, I salute you. Indeed, let's all help younger women be aware of how they can preserve this very important part of their womanhood. However, I don't believe they were the ones tuning into the show for this particular topic yesterday. And please, let's be a bit more sensitive to the women who are now in the thick of the fight. For the most part, and for the women of my generation, it has been a challenge to find men who are not reluctant to commit until their late 30s and 40s. And, at that time, they are no longer looking for a peer but seeking an 'under 30' because, as I was told many times myself at 36: 'Why would I want a women my own age? I want to have kids.' Looking back and reflecting on the Big Questions, I believe a better topic might have been, 'Is it selfish to be an older DAD?' Or perhaps even bette: 'Is it selfish for MEN to delay or avoid fatherhood and commitment with a long-term partner?'","Columnist Ashley Pearson had first baby at 41 .

"By . Richard Spillett . A married teacher at the centre of a sex scandal has been permanently struck off the teaching register. Bernadette Smith, 35, had an affair with 16-year-old pupil Gary Ralston after teaching him at Bannockburn High in Stirling. After narrowly avoiding a prison sentence over the relationship, Smith has now been barred from ever teaching again. Bernadette Smith spent the night in 16-year-old Gary Ralston's bed after confessing her feelings to him in a school classroom . Smith, who worked as history and English teacher before her suspension, has described the relationship as 'ten days of madness'. Stirling . Sheriff Court heard last month how the affair, which started with . kissing in a park and ended with her spending the night in his bed, had . cost her reputation. The . court heard that Smith told police and colleagues she was 'in love' with Gary, whom she had taught and also given after-school tuition. The . affair started in Smith’s classroom, where she confessed her feelings . to the boy, before the pair went to a park and had their first kiss. However, Gary’s grandmother found out what the pair were doing and told the school, which suspended Smith immediately. Mother-of-three . Smith then visited the house Gary shared with his father, Richard, and . she and Gary spent the night together in the teenager's bed. She later told police that she had told Mr Ralston about her feelings for his son. Smith, 35, was placed on the sex offenders' register over the relationship and has now been barred from teaching . Stirling schoolboy Gary Ralston in the bedroom where he spent the night with his teacher . Smith pleaded guilty to engaging in sexual activity with a pupil while in a position of trust between September 13 and 20 last year. She was placed her under supervision for two years as part of a community sentence, which will also see her put on the sex offenders’ register for the same period. Papers released by the General Teaching Council (GTC) today reveal she ha nows been permanently banned from the classroom. The GTC said: 'She indicated to GTC Scotland that she wished to be removed from GTC Scotland’s Register in view of the allegation made against her relating to her fitness to teach. 'In accordance with Rule 3.7.1, she was issued a Removal with Consent Order. This Order has been signed and returned by the Respondent.' Smith, of Denny, Stirlingshire, waived her right to a full hearing at the GTC in Edinburgh. She will be served with the official papers with in 14 days and has 28 days to appeal against the decision. The affair took place after the pair met at Bannockburn High in Stirling, which suspended Smith as soon as the relationship came to light . After the criminal court case, Gary, who waived his anonymity to speak of the relationship, said he didn’t know how the affair had happened, but that Smith had always been his favourite teacher. He said: 'I was thinking I was quite lucky. A lot of the boys fancied her. I couldn’t believe she was with me. 'It was the last thing I expected. She said she thought she was going crazy but couldn’t help the way she was feeling.' He said he was worried for Smith’s job, husband and family but said she ‘didn’t seem too bothered’. He added: ‘We got ready for bed and I felt nervous. I got into bed with my boxers on. 'She took off her top, but kept her bra and jeans on, and slid in beside me. We cuddled and talked – nothing else happened.’ Following the court proceedings, Smith said that her life had changed after her husband had an affair and a child with another woman. She said: 'The police asked me if I loved Gary. I said I did. But I realise now I didn’t. Looking back, it is hard to explain how I felt at the time. 'I didn’t fancy Gary but I was so consumed by wanting to make sure he was OK that even when I was sitting in a cell at the police station, all I could think about was him.'","Bernadette Smith, 35, said she was 'in love' with 16-year-old Gary Ralston .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . and Associated Press . President Barack Obama promised on Friday to end the government's access to millions of Americans' telephone call data, but launched a strong defense of the National Security Agency's performance. In a wide-ranging speech that touched on the future of American intelligence-gathering, the 'damage' Edward Snowden's leaks have done and a snipe at Russia's feigned outrage over the revelations, he also promised that he would no longer authorize snooping on foreign heads of state. 'The leaders of our close friends and allies deserve to know that if I want to learn what they think about an issue, I will pick up the phone and call them, rather than turning to surveillance,' he said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Capping a months-long review, President Barack Obama, pictured today, backed modest changes to the U.S. government's surveillance network at home and abroad while largely leaving the framework of the controversial programs in place . The lapel pin is really a microphone: Obama promised that he would call Germany's Angela Merkel and other world leaders for information in the future, instead of tapping their private calls . The move to curtail the NSA's . controversial bulk phone record surveillance is the first major change . to the program since it was first uncovered in 2013 when Snowden stole . evidence of its existence. Obama . warned that the 'sensational' way Snowden chose to reveal what he knew . will have impact U.S. intelligence and national security 'in ways that . we may not fully understand for years to come.' 'The . same technological advances that allow U.S. intelligence agencies to . pinpoint an al Qaeda cell in Yemen or an email between two terrorists in . the Sahel,' Obama said Friday morning in a speech at the Justice . Department, 'also mean that many routine communications around the world . are within our reach.' 'At a time when more and more of our lives are digital, that prospect is disquieting for all of us.' And . 'the combination of increased digital information and powerful . supercomputers,' he acknowledged, 'offers intelligence agencies the . possibility of sifting through massive amounts of bulk data to identify . patterns or pursue leads that may thwart impending threats.' 'But the government collection and storage of such bulk data also creates a potential for abuse.' Obama did not recommend whether the government, private telecommunications companies, or third-party groups should control the phone data that the government has collected, but called on Attorney General Eric Holder, Congress and the intelligence community to decide. Major announcement: Obama trimmed the powers of the secretive US eavesdropping agency Friday by calling for new privacy safeguards, but allowed bulk phone data sweeps to continue as an anti-terror tool . Giving it back: A presidential review panel has recommended taking the data from the NSA (pictured) and giving it to the telephone companies or a third party - but the companies have balked at the idea . A presidential review panel has . recommended moving the data outside of the government's control. But . phone providers have balked at changes that would put them back in . control of the records and expose them to new legal liabilities. Obama strained to insist that 'the program does not involve the NSA examining the phone records of ordinary Americans.' 'Rather, it consolidates these records into a database that the government can query if it has a specific lead.' But . because of the public uproar after Snowden exposed the initiative, . Obama will change the parameters of the program to limit fishing . expeditions and extend the reach of skeptical judges. 'Effective . immediately,' he said Friday, 'we will only pursue phone calls that are . two steps removed from a number associated with a terrorist . organization instead of three.' 'And I have directed the Attorney General to work with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court,' the president promised, 'so that during this transition period, the database can be queried only after a judicial finding, or in a true emergency.' While privacy advocates will cheer the announcement, Obama's decision will frustrate some intelligence officials. Flying the flag: Obama hit out at Russia for feigning outrage over the leaks while at the same time trying to spy on the US . Coming out of the shadows: Obama promised greater transparency of the secret services . The impact of Snowden's revelations was felt in the text of Obama's speech. While he refused to directly comment on the fugitive from justice, the president lobbed broadsides at him without naming names. 'Given the fact of an open investigation, I'm not going to dwell on Mr. Snowden's actions or motivations,' he said. 'Our nation's defense depends in part on the fidelity of those entrusted with our nation's secrets.' 'If any individual who objects to government policy can take it in their own hands to publicly disclose classified information, then we will not be able to keep our people safe, or conduct foreign policy.' He later railed against Russia, similarly without identifying the nation by name, when he complained about foreign governments that feign outrage over America's surveillance program. Such nations, he said, 'are constantly probing our government and private sector networks, and accelerating programs to listen to our conversations, intercept our emails, or compromise our systems.' Russian president Vladimir Putin has granted Snowden temporary asylum, allowing him to evade prosecution in the U.S. on three felony counts. Obama's announced changes come at the beginning of a tense political year when Democrats face numerous policy obstacles and White House scandals in a bid to maintain control of the U.S. Senate, which has served as a backstop against House Republicans eager to dismantle Obama's first-term agenda – including the Obamacare law. Shoring up the public's confidence in the NSA's spying operations with the addition of independent oversight, a White House source told MailOnline, is 'in part a move to quiet down the uproar in time for November.' Leak: Obama said the 'damage' from Edward Snowden's leaks would be 'felt for years to come' Officials said Friday that even after months of studying the surveillance issues, Obama was still grappling with his decisions in the hours leading up to the speech. What appeared certain was that the NSA's phone record gathering would continue in some form, including digital data collection overseas. 'U.S. intelligence agencies will only use such data to meet specific security requirements,' Obama promised, including 'counter-intelligence; counter-terrorism; counter-proliferation; cyber-security; force protection for our troops and allies; and combating transnational crime, including sanctions evasion' – a clear warning to Iran amid concerns over its growing nuclear program. 'People around the world – regardless of their nationality – should know that the United States is not spying on ordinary people who don’t threaten our national security,' he explained, 'and that we take their privacy concerns into account.' 'This applies to foreign leaders as well,' said Obama, in a clear reference to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose phone was being snooped on by the NSA, according to leaks from Snowden. 'Given the understandable attention that this issue has received, I have made clear to the intelligence community that – unless there is a compelling national security purpose – we will not monitor the communications of heads of state and government of our close friends and allies.' Digital policy analysts offered cautious praise. Sascha Meinrath, director of the New America Institute's Open Technology Institute, said in a statement that 'many key questions and reforms were left unaddressed' by Obama, 'and many controversies punted to Congress or to other government officials. ' 'To restore the trust in the United States as a responsible steward of the Internet, the president should be acting now and forcefully to take the advice of his own handpicked advisory panel, by immediately ending the NSA's collection of bulk data and supporting strong reforms.'","President Obama announced changes in a speech on Friday morning .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A self-portrait of Sir Anthony van Dyck could remain in Britain after the withdrawal of its buyer – the son-in-law of Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone. Financier James Stunt, who is married to Mr Ecclestone’s daughter Petra, said he pulled out of the purchase in ‘light of the people’s passion’ to keep it in the UK. The artwork, dating back to 1640, had been destined for his LA home but a fundraising campaign called for it to stay in Britain. The self-portrait by Sir Anthony Van Dyck at the National Portrait Gallery in central London. Campaigners want to raise the money needed to keep the painting in Britain . The work, which dates back to 1640, has now been offered to the National Portrait Gallery in London for £10 million after discussions between Mr Stunt, art dealer Philip Mould and its current owner Alfred Bader. Mr Stunt said: 'When I agreed to buy this great portrait I didn't expect the huge swell of public opinion and the strength of emotion its export would generate. 'In light of the people's passion to purchase the Van Dyck for the nation I have carefully reconsidered my position and have decided, with Dr Bader and Mr Mould's agreement, to withdraw from the process. 'I trust that my withdrawal, together with the reduced price at which the painting is now being offered, will see the appeal succeed and that Van Dyck's final self portrait will permanently hang in the National Portrait Gallery.' Financier James Stunt (far left), the husband of F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone's daughter, Petra (centre), has withdrawn his bid for the painting . Campaigners have already raised £3.6million towards buying the painting, with donations coming in from thousands of people, and have four months left to meet the new price which is £2.5million less than originally stated. Mr Mould said: 'Watching the public reaction to Van Dyck's self-portrait develop in this unprecedented way has been amazing, and, for this lover of British historical portraiture, reassuring. 'The picture has become an iconic focal point, and for many the thought of it going to the United States would be like losing a chunk of Stonehenge. I am delighted to be able to help the National Portrait Gallery's campaign in this way.' The work was in a private collection for almost 400 years before it was sold - forcing the Government to issue a temporary export bar which allowed campaigners time to try and save it. Van Dyck was born in modern-day Belgium and came to work in England in 1632 at the invitation of King Charles I. The painting, which is on show at the central London gallery, will go around the country on a three-year tour if it is saved.","Painting was due to be moved to the LA home of financier James Stunt .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Printer Philip Lewis was looking forward to a relaxing drink after work when he stopped at an Esso garage. He was in for a disappointment however. The assistant would not serve Mr Lewis, 58, who has a moustache and receding grey hair because he could not prove his age. Mr Lewis did not have any photographic identification on him – and was forced to leave empty-handed. No ID No lager: 58-year-old Philip Lewis was refused four cans of lager at a garage in Somerset because he could not prove he was over 18 . Petrol station managers have since apologised and admitted the shop assistant had applied ‘a little too much zeal’ to its strict policy on alcohol sales. Mr Lewis, of Radstock, Somerset, said: ‘I could understand it if I was nearer 25 and looked that way but I will be 59 in June. I don’t carry my driving licence with me. ‘There was a queue behind me and I felt really humiliated and demoralised. I reckon I spend about £2,000 in there on petrol and magazines over a year – and I was made to feel like that at my age.’ Refusal: This Esso garage in Midsomer Norton, Somerset. refused to serve Philip Lewis with four cans of lager because Mr Lewis, 58, could not prove he is over 18 . The garage that likes to say no: A shop assistant at this Esso petrol station refused to serve 58-year-old Philip Lewis with lager because he had no photographic proof of age on him . Mr Lewis said he is boycotting the Norton Service Station in Midsomer Norton, Somerset, after the incident. A spokeman for the garage said: ‘We apologise to Mr Lewis for any offence or inconvenience caused during his visit to the service station. ‘While we have strict rules concerning the sale of alcohol, it is clear they were applied with a little too much zeal on this occasion. ‘We have advised the sales assistant accordingly, and will contact Mr Lewis to offer him a small gift as a goodwill gesture.’ Selling alcohol to someone under 18 can lead to a maximum fine of £20,000 for bar staff/managers. Retailers can reserve the right to refuse the sale of alcohol to an adult if they’re accompanied by a child and think the alcohol is being bought for the child. In 2005, the British Beer and Pub Association introduced a Challenge 21 campaign to prevent underage drinking. This has evolved into the Challenge 25 policy of most supermarkets in England and Wales including Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons along with Marks & Spencer, The Co-operative, Bargain Booze and Waitrose. Esso also take part in the scheme. However, the scheme has no official or legally enforceable basis.","Assistant refused to serve printer Philip Lewis of Radstock, Somerset .

"By . Sam Webb . Six people suspected of being 'slaves' have been rescued by police following a raid at a Bournemouth garage this morning. Dorset Police raided the AA Clock Garage as part of an investigation into forced labour and human trafficking. As a result six men, aged between 20 and 30, have been taken to a place of safety and are being given all the help and support they need. A 23-year-old man from Bournemouth has been arrested in connection with slavery offences. Freed: Six men were rescued from a garage on Ringwood Road in Bournemouth (pictured) today after a police raid. A 23-year-old man from Bournemouth has been arrested in connection with slavery offences . Detective Superintendent Kevin Connolly, who is leading the investigation, said: 'Today's operation is the result of a detailed and protracted inquiry and our primary aim is to protect and safeguard vulnerable victims. 'Human trafficking is happening up and down the country. 'In such cases victims are often forced to live and work in poor and unsanitary conditions, sometimes with little or no pay. Some may not recognise themselves as victims and, even if they do, they may feel unable to speak to the police or other authorities.' The business sells cars and vans and is also a hand car wash centre. It has no connection with the Automobile Association. A person living near the garage told the Bournemouth Echo: 'They keep themselves very much to themselves. 'They come and go. We were on holiday over the summer period and when we came back there was a minibus of them going and the crowd that were there before had gone. 'They've never bothered the neighbours, but it's deteriorated since it's opened.' Det Supt Connolly added: 'Human trafficking is a serious offence and Dorset Police remains committed towards tackling such cases. 'Human trafficking, particularly in the form of servitude, is a hidden crime and we will do everything we can to ensure this immoral trade is stopped. 'In order to do this we also need help from the public. 'I would urge anyone who has any information about such offences in Dorset or concerns about people in their community to contact us in confidence on 101.' During the operation, police were assisted by Bournemouth Borough Council, the National Crime Agency and the Red Cross. A British Red Cross spokeswoman said: 'The British Red Cross has been called in by Dorset Police to provide assistance to people being supported in a place of safety following an investigation into forced labour and human trafficking. 'The Red Cross works with the emergency services to provide assistance to vulnerable people in times of crisis.'","Dorset Police raided a garage in Bournemouth this morning .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A banker's son who was found to have cocaine in his car when he was stopped for jumping traffic lights was let off by magistrates without penalty for the drugs. Massimo Agostinelli, 26, whose billionaire father Robert Agostinelli, 60, once tried to buy Liverpool FC, sped through an amber light in central London in his girlfriend's black Mercedes. Officers who pulled him over found he was disqualified from driving and also discovered a biscuit wrapper containing cocaine in the passenger footwell. Banker's son Massimo Agostinelli, 26, escaped punishment for having cocaine in his car after he was caught jumping traffic lights in London . Agostinelli, of Cadogan Gardens, Chelsea, passed a drugs test and told police he didn't use drugs and that the cocaine must have belonged to a passenger, whom he refused to name. Today he appeared before magistrates in Hammersmith, west London, for sentencing after he was charged with driving while disqualified and without insurance and possession of Class A drugs. The court heard Agostinelli was stopped just after 6pm on 30 January after he jumped traffic lights in Sumner Place in South Kensington. Prosecutor Jade Adenubi said: ‘He was questioned about the drugs in the car and he said in relation to that, that he didn’t use drugs himself. ‘He said they asked him in relation to the item that was seized, the white powder, ""Were you aware of what it was?"" and he said ""I’m not going to lie, I knew what it was"".’ Agostinelli said the drugs were left by a ‘degenerate’ and a recreational drug user, the court heard. The court was told that in interview, the financier's son said: ‘I would rather not say, I don’t want to involve someone else right now. 'He is a recreational drug user who doesn’t really do it that often.' He said: ‘I was scared, I am not a criminal, I don’t want to be in that world or associated with it.’ Mark Haslam, defending, said that receiving a drugs conviction would have significant consequences for the student who survives on a ‘modest allowance’ from his family. ‘His financial position is that he is a student, he is supported by his family which in turn has given rise to difficulties for him,’ he said. ‘His family live in the US including his dying grandmother, who is dying of cancer,’ added Mr Haslam. Agostinelli is the son of self-made billionaire, Robert Agostinelli, pictured with his former fiancee, Charlotte Lucas . He said Agostinelli accepted the blame for both driving offences, saying that the defendant had not been notified of the ban by the DVLA because he had moved house without notifying the DVLA and thus had not received correspondence from them. And he said the defendant pleaded guilty to the drugs charge on the basis that the cocaine was in the car, although he said it did not belong to him. District Judge Quentin Purdy told Agostinelli: ‘I am prepared to treat the drugs matter as being possession in a very technical sense - but not as a drug user or abuser and not with intent to supply.’ 'I'm going to make no separate penalty as far as [the cocaine] is concerned - it is an unusual disposal' District Judge Quentin Purdy . ‘I’m going to make no separate penalty as far as that is concerned - it is an unusual disposal,’ he said. But he said it was Agostinell’s responsibility to notify the DVLA of his change of address and issued £200 fines for each driving offence. Agostinelli was disqualified from driving for eight weeks, and ordered to pay a £40 victim surcharge and £85 prosecution costs. His father owns private equity firm Rhone Group and is the 416th richest man in the US, according to Forbes. Earlier this month Mr Agostinelli launched a legal battle against his former fiancee, Charlotte Lucas, to force her to return a £400,000 engagement ring he bought her. The tycoon has been branded ungallant for making the legal demands of his PR executive former lover, with whom he was in a relationship for six years.","Massimo Agostinelli, 26, was pulled over by police in South Kensington .

"By . Mark Duell . An oil worker who has been facing bankrupcy by spending £250,000 on legal fees today won a 16-year court battle over a laptop. Richard Durkin, a 44-year-old father of two, claimed that HFC Bank ruined his credit rating after he tried to back out of an agreement to buy a computer from PC World for £1,499. He took his case to court and initially won, but it was overturned. However, today the Supreme Court in Central London allowed his appeal and ruled he should receive damages of £8,000. Victory: Richard Durkin has won a 16-year legal battle over a laptop and been awarded £8,000 in damages. However the case has cost him £250,000 . Mr Durkin said that he was disappointed the Supreme Court did not restore the damages of £116,000 awarded by a Scottish court in 2008. But he added in a statement: ‘This decision is a great victory for all consumers and I am proud to have been the driving force behind it. Long battle: Father-of-two Richard Durkin claimed that HFC Bank ruined his credit rating . ‘As a result of the decision, no consumer will have to endure again what I had to put up with - the loss of the ability to buy a family home because of wrongful blacklisting of me. ‘Taking a case to any court is a huge stress, but taking it to the highest court in the land with all the risks that go with it was the most stressful thing that anyone could voluntarily put themselves through. But sometimes you have to do what is right, and not what is easy. ‘This case was not all about me. It was about principle for all consumers. I always felt that PC World and HFC Bank had acted disgracefully towards me, and I have now been proved right.’ In an earlier hearing, a court ordered the bank to pay him £116,000 in damages, but after that decision was reversed he launched a new appeal at the highest court in Britain. Mr Durkin, an offshore construction surveyor, bought the laptop from the Aberdeen branch of PC World in 1998, paying a £50 deposit and signing a £1,499 credit agreement with HFC - now part of HSBC - for the remainder. He claimed he was told he could get a refund if he had a problem with the computer, but when he complained that it did not have an inbuilt modem a manager said he could not have his money back. Although PC World eventually relented, HFC told Mr Durkin he was obliged to carry on making payments, arguing that the credit agreement was legally unrelated to the purchase of the computer. He was put on a credit blacklist until 2005, which he believes prevented him from buying a new home in Spain. Mr Durkin insisted all along that the . credit agreement with HFC was dependent on the purchase of the laptop, . meaning that it was void as soon as he returned the computer.

'Damages resulting from HFC’s breach of its duty of care are confined to injury to Mr Durkin’s credit in the sum of £8,000.

"By . Paul Donnelley . Robber: Daniel Holland had attempted the robbery weeks after being released from prison eight years into a life sentence for a spate of robberies . This is a moment a silver-haired shop assistant got the better of a burly, masked robber during a scuffle. The brave woman, aged in her late 50s, was confronted by armed thug Daniel Holland when he burst into a Tesco Express store just as she opened the doors at 5.30am. The diminutive assistant grabbed hold of Holland and grappled with him on the shop floor. CCTV images of the attack show the have-a-go heroine clinging on to Holland as he pushed her inside the shop. But the woman, who is about 5ft tall and has not been named, soon turned the tables on the robber, pinning him up against a counter until support arrived from her colleague. The male manager of the store in West Moors near Ferndown, Dorset, grabbed the plastic pipe Holland was wielding and used it to beat him around the head. Holland, who is 5ft 8ins tall, was wearing a black beanie hat with eye holes cut out but he was forced to remove it after the tussle to catch his breath. In doing so he showed his face to the security cameras, helping police to identify him. Holland left the plastic pipe and the hat at the scene and police were able to secure DNA evidence from it to help convict the robber.

More . than 600 plants were found growing in the factory along with a bin bag full of . cannabis buds that had been harvested. The total value of the find was . in excess of £500,000. Robert Dibb and Wayne Ivory were charged with producing more than 20 kilograms of cannabis and were found guilty after a trial at Leeds Crown Court . Robert . Dibb and Wayne Ivory were found bare-chested in the cellar due to the . heat from powerful lamps. Both men were arrested on suspicion of the . production of cannabis. The . pair were charged with producing more than 20 kilograms of cannabis and . were found guilty after a trial at Leeds Crown Court. Ivory, 42, of Stanningley, was sentenced to five years in prison and Dibb, 52, of Rawdon, received a three year term. Neighbourhood officer PC Chris Davey noticed a strong smell of cannabis and what appeared to be a brand new ventilation chimney on the roof of the building. Then when he and fellow officers entered they found a large, dusty workshop area which was covered with rubble and old furniture. The ventilation chimney had been bricked up and went straight down into the floor, raising officers' suspicions that plants may be in the cellar. The two men who grew cannabis plants worth half a million pounds concealed in a secret factory behind a trapdoor in a disused building have been jailed for eight years . The illegal operation was only rumbled when neighbourhood police officers sniffed out the plants at a disused former engineering works, in Stanningley, Leeds, West Yorkshire and discovered a four room cellar filled with cannabis . They also noted that the floor was very warm despite there being no heating system. There was no obvious access to any cellar but they then heard the sound of a large metal box being moved. The officers saw a man emerge from a hole in the floor along with a flood of light and a strong smell of cannabis. The man disappeared back down the hole after being challenged by the officers. They followed him through the secret trapdoor and down a ladder and discovered a four-room cellar filled with cannabis plants. Further examination of the scene showed the metal box had been placed over the disguised trapdoor to conceal the cellar below, where they discovered Dibb and Ivory. Insp Simon Jessup, of the Armley, Bramley and Stanningley Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: 'This was a highly sophisticated cannabis growing operation that the offenders went to great lengths to conceal within what at face value appeared to be a dusty old disused factory. Officers entered through the secret trapdoor and down a ladder and discovered a four-room cellar filled with cannabis plants . A metal box had been placed over the disguised trapdoor to conceal the cellar below, where they discovered Dibb and Ivory . 'PC Davey however wasn’t fooled and his suspicions led to the discovery of this cannabis farm and the downfall of the men running it. 'Neighbourhood officers like him spend a lot of time out in their communities and tend to notice when something isn’t right. 'Yet again a significant quantity of cannabis has been seized before it could enter the illegal drugs market that fuels crime and anti-social behaviour in our communities. 'I would encourage local residents to look out for suspicious activity in their areas that could indicate a property is being used to grow cannabis. 'If people notice an unusual smell, boarded-up windows, electrical equipment being delivered in significant quantities, or people coming and going at all hours, I would urge them to pass their suspicions on to us so we can check it out.'","Operation rumbled when neighbourhood police officers sniffed out plants .

But now a concept for a different type of smartwatch promises to measure the passing of time in a number of scents, rather than beeps and buzzes. One computer expert has created a prototype watch that includes four dinky perfume bottles, which release fragrances associated with different times of the day. Aisen Caro Chacin, a physical computing lecturer at at the Parsons New School for Design, New York, created the less-stressful smartwatch, which is designed to gently intensify the sense of time. The ScentRhythm watch is bulky as it features four perfume bottles as well as the mechanics to release the scents. It is intended to feature fragrances associated with waking up, relaxing, times of activity and sleeping. Each of the four glass vials holds a millilitre of scent and every six hours the smartwatch releases a whiff of the perfume selected for the specific time of day, Popsci reported. For example, a wearer could be woken up by the smell of freshly brewed coffee or a whiff of camomile to relax before falling asleep. The unconventional timepiece (pictured) does not show a clock face, but is is intended to feature fragrances associated with waking up, relaxing, times of activity and sleeping . A wearer of the smartwatch could be woken up by the smell of freshly brewed coffee (pictured) or a whiff of camomile to relax before falling asleep . The watch does not have a conventional clock face but instead emits suitable scents every six hours to draw the wearer's attention to the passing of time. The design includes four vials of perfume associated with waking up, relaxing, activity and sleeping. It wafts scents periodically using piexoelectric atomisers that sit above each vial of perfume and emit a smell when they are triggered by the watch's electronics. The atomisers vibrate at ultrasonic frequencies inaudible to the vast majority of humans, to convert a tiny amount of the scented liquid into vapour. The smartwatch’s electronics are powered by a lithium-ion battery that can be charged using a micro-USB port and typically last 24 hours on a single charge.

"By . William Turvill . The makers of Candy Crush Saga have seen nearly $1 billion wiped off the company's value after its first day of trading on the stock market. King's initial public offering (IPO) was priced at $22.50 on Tuesday, valuing the company at $7.1 billion. But it opened on Wednesday at $20.50, down almost 9 per cent and had lost more ground by mid-morning. King's shares fell to a low of $19.08 at one stage on Wednesday morning, valuing the company at about $6 billion. The makers of Candy Crush Saga have seen nearly $1 billion wiped off the company's value after its first day of trading on the stock market . King Digital Entertainment PLC, based in . Ireland, had $1.88 billion in revenue last year - more than ten times . its 2012 revenue of $164.4 million. The company’s games also include Pet Rescue Saga and Farm Heroes Saga, but analysts have questioned whether King would be able to repeat the success of Candy Crush. But Riccardo Zacconi, King's co-founder and chief executive, told CNBC this morning that the company is ‘not just a one-hit wonder’ and pointed out that it has three games in the top ten on Facebook. King is trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ‘KING’. By mid-morning, the stock was down $2.50, or 11 per cent, at $20 per share. King's initial public offering was priced at $22.50 on Tuesday, valuing the company at around $7.1 billion . But it opened on Wednesday at $20.50, down almost 9 per cent and had lost more ground by mid-morning . ‘With King Digital, there is a lot of concern about its ability to keep coming up with popular games,’ said Jay Ritter, a professor and IPO expert at the University of Florida. ‘The offer price was set at the middle of the filed price range, indicating that there was neither exceptionally strong nor exceptionally weak demand,’ Mr Ritter said. The two-year-old Candy Crush game, in which users move candies to line up at least three in the same color, has a seemingly endless supply of new levels and features to keep its nearly 100 million users occupied every day. Its success has spawned reports of Candy Crush addiction with a Facebook page dedicated to addicts of the game, in which users get daily bonuses and new levels every few weeks. The free game has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch on mobile devices. Using the ‘freemium’ model, King makes money by selling players extra lives, lucky candy and other add-ons. King sold 15.5 million shares of the 22.2 million offered, with the rest coming from stakeholders including private equity firm Apax Partners, which remains the biggest shareholder. London-based King raised about $500 million in its IPO. While analysts have questioned whether the success of Candy Crush Saga can be repeated, King's chief executive has insisted the game is more than just a 'one-hit wonder' In February, King said an average 144 million daily active users played its games more than 1.4 billion times per day. King's IPO is the largest by a mobile gaming company since Zynga Inc went public in 2011, valuing the maker of ‘Farmville’ at $7 billion. Zynga's market value has since shrunk to just over $4 billion, another victim of concerns about the danger of investing in companies that rely heavily on a hit game. Its shares fell 4 per cent. While King also offers about other 180 games, about three-quarters of its revenue comes from ‘Candy Crush’. ‘We're building on traffic from Candy Crush,' Mr Zacconi said in an interview on CNBC, adding that the users attracted by the game will play its other games. Riccardo rejected suggestions that his company faced the same issues as Zynga, which was heavily dependent on Facebook. ‘I think we're different because we cracked mobile, not only reach, but monetisation, which allows us to buy marketing and be in control of the steering wheel ... we are not reliant on someone featuring us,’ he said.","King's initial public offering was priced at $22.50, valuing it at $7.1 billion .

"By . Dan Bloom . A British soldier has been charged over claims he made a nail bomb and had a copy of the Anarchist Cookbook. Ryan McGee, 19, was detained while serving in Germany with 5th Battalion the Rifles after a suspicious device - understood to be a nail bomb - was found at his home in Salford, Greater Manchester. Prosecutors say he had a copy of the Anarchist Cookbook, the controversial 1971 manual which contains instructions on making bombs and manufacturing illegal drugs. Manual: It is claimed Ryan McGee (left) had the infamous 1971 book (right) with 'recipes' for explosive devices . McGee was arrested on December 2 last year at Paderborn Garrison in Germany and detained in military custody before being returned to Britain, where Greater Manchester Police arrested him under the Terrorism Act. McGee's unit uses the Warrior fighting vehicle â€“ one of the most potent battlefield weapons in the infantry. The soldier would have had the opportunity to learn how to drive the 40-tonne Warrior, which has been used in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans. The Rifleman was bailed last year while police carried out further investigations and today he was charged with two offences - one of making an explosive device and another of possessing a document, namely the Cookbook, for the purposes of terrorism. He has been held in custody and will appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court next Wednesday. Jane Stansfield, of the Crown Prosecution Service counter-terrorism division, said: 'This decision to prosecute was taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors. 'We have determined that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that a prosecution is in the public interest.' Scene: The street in Eccles, Greater Manchester, in which the nail bomb was found last year . She added: 'It is alleged that between . May 31 2012 and November 29 2013, Ryan Adam McGee had possession of a . document or record for terrorist purposes, namely a copy of The . Anarchist Cookbook. 'He has been charged with one offence contrary to Section 58(1)(b) of the Terrorism Act 2000. 'It . is also alleged that Ryan Adam McGee, between September 1 and 30 2013 . made an improvised explosive and has therefore also been charged with . one offence contrary to Section 4 of the Explosive Substances Act 1883.' The Anarchist Cookbook, first published in 1971, contains instructions for the manufacture of explosives as well as for home manufacturing of illicit drugs. It was written by former New York bookshop manager William Powell, who said he wanted to express his anger against the U.S. military's presence in Vietnam. The book reportedly sold more than two million copies but became notorious for its use by militants and terrorists. Appearance: The 19-year-old soldier is due to appear next week at Westminster Magistrates' Court . In December last year, Powell wrote an . article for the Guardian in which he expressed regret for writing the . book and called for it to go out of print. 'Over the years, I have come to understand that the basic premise behind the Cookbook is profoundly flawed,' he wrote. 'The anger that motivated the writing of the Cookbook blinded me to the illogical notion that violence can be used to prevent violence.' The armoured infantry regiment is based at Paderborn and is equipped with the Warrior Armoured Fighting Vehicle. The regiment has recently served on numerous operations including Iraq, Afghanistan and The Balkans. An Army spokesperson would not confirm whether McGee was still officially a member of the armed forces. She added: 'We are aware Rifleman McGee has been charged today. We have assisted Greater Manchester Police with their investigation, and as the case continues it would be inappropriate to comment further.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Ryan McGee, 19, was serving in Germany with 5th Battalion the Rifles .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A multi-million pound deal which saw coal mining firm Bumi split from its co-founder was sealed amid a flurry of explosive tweets in which warring billionaires described each other as 'dumb'. London-based mining firm Bumi - now known as Asia Resource Minerals plc (ARMS) - has completed a long-awaited separation from its co-founders - an Indonesian family conglomerate known as the Bakrie group. After the restructuring deal was closed, fellow founder Nat Rothschild – the 42-year-old scion of the wealthy banking dynasty - took to his Twitter page to take a swipe at a member of the Bakrie family. Exchange: Nat Rothschild (left) sent a message on Twitter to Aga Bakrie (right) which said: 'Thanks for buying back a worthless pile of turd' He posted: ‘Thanks for buying back a worthless pile of turd’ directly to Aga Bakrie, the son of the chairman of the Indonesian group. It started a flurry of fiery messages between the pair, who have been bickering since the company's shareholders voted in December to split from the co-founding Bakrie family in a major restructure. Oxford-educated financier Mr Rothschild also labelled Adika ‘Aga’ Nuraga Bakrie, 32, ‘extremely dumb’, during the public Twitter row which erupted after the corporate break up. He wrote: ‘Whilst your dad is an evil genius (yes I'm paying nirwan a compliment), the word on the street is that you are extremely DUMB!’ Mr Bakrie responded to the message with: ‘Haha... ""Dumb"" I believe that’s the word that has been associated with you by most of the people that I have met.’ Asia Resource Minerals was founded as Bumi in 2010 by the influential Bakries and financier Nat Rothschild, with the aim of giving London investors access to promising Indonesian coal assets. Nat Rothschild sent a message on Twitter to Aga Bakrie, son of the chairman of the  Indonesian conglomerate, which said: 'Thanks for buying back a worthless pile of turd' Financer Mr Rothschild also labelled Adika 'Aga' Nuraga Bakrie 'extremely dumb', during the public Twitter row which erupted after the corporate break up . Aga Bakrie, the son of the chairman of the Indonesian-based Bakrie group, hit back at the claims and labelled Bumi co-founder Mr Rothschild 'dumb' as well . But the business suffered from boardroom rows, allegations of wrongdoing and falling coal prices. Its shares have lost almost 80 per cent of their value since the business was set up. To revive the business's fortunes, . shareholders voted in December to split from Indonesia's Bakrie family, . but it took longer than expected due to difficulties of raising the . necessary cash. With . the split completed, ARMS will now focus on turning around its other . main Indonesian subsidiary, Berau Coal, while giving up a stake in . Asia's top thermal coal exporter PT Bumi Resources. ARMS Chief Executive Nick von Schirnding said he felt ‘vindicated’. He . said: ‘There were a number of stakeholders saying this would never . happen. I can't say it has been easy, it was a complicated transaction, . but to have achieved this is excellent for our shareholders. Mr Rothschild, pictured in February last year, took to his Twitter page to take a swipe at the powerful business group after the deal was closed . ‘Our . focus is on our subsidiary now. We need to regain credibility and . today's announcement is the first step in that direction.’ ARMS said it would now return $400 million to shareholders but did not give any timeframe and did not specify in what form the money will be returned. Shareholders welcomed the completion of the separation but said they hoped ARMS would return closer to the $501 million it got from the deal. Mr Rothschild said: ‘I think it's important to return the maximum amount of money because there is no appetite from the major shareholders, certainly not from me, to entrust money with the management team in London to redeploy that capital. ‘We want the business ... to be run as efficiently as possible and for all dividends to be passed through to shareholders.’","Mega-rich co-founders of coal mining firm Bumi split in multi-million deal .

"By . Jill Reilly . California’s three-year drought has prompted a new gold rush in the same Sierra Nevada foothills that drew legions of fortune . seekers from around the world in the mid-1800s. The dry conditions mean streams and other water pools started to dry up from the drought, exposing areas that previously could not be explored due to the the depth of the water. The gold rush from December to January saw amateur prospectors dig for riverbed riches in spots that have been out of reach for decades. Scroll down for video . Tim Amavisca, 38, and his daughter Hailey, 15, use a sluice box which is used to trap gold flakes on a textured rubber mat as they search for gold along the Bear River near Colfax, California . California¿s three-year drought has prompted a new gold rush in the same Sierra Nevada foothills that drew legions of fortune seekers from around the world in the mid-1800s . 'If you have ever tried to scoop a shovel of mud and sand under water, it is nearly impossible,' said Jim Hutchings of the River City Prospectors told Accuweather. 'Having the 'gut' of the stream dry out, gives miners access to move boulders and access cracks and crevices in the center of the stream or at least in what would be the center of the stream during flood stage.' Without water, miners can get in and try to get to the bedrock where the best gold will usually be in a protected place there. Without water, miners can get in and try to get to the bedrock where the best gold will usually be in a protected place there . The gold rush from December to January saw amateur prospectors dig for riverbed riches in spots that have been out of reach for decades . Mr Amavisca displays a small vial of gold flakes found while gold panning along the Bear River . Amavisca, recently left the military and has been prospecting several times a week this winter - a time when it's usually raining and river levels are too high for gold panning . 'With the drought going on, we're able to dig in more locations that wouldn't be accessible at later times,' said Tim Amavisca, who wore waterproof overalls as he panned in the Bear River near Colfax with his teenage daughter on a recent Friday afternoon. On January 24, 1848, James Wilson Marshall, a carpenter originally from New Jersey, found flakes of gold in the American River at the base of the Sierra Nevada Mountains near Coloma, California. 'It made my heart thump, for I was certain it was gold,' he later recalled. Marshall shared the discovery with (John) Sutter who employed Marshall to build his mill. The discovery of gold nuggets meant all the men working on the mill left to find their fortune in gold and it eventually fell into disrepair. News of Marshall’s discovery brought thousands of immigrants to California from elsewhere in the United States and from other countries, prompting the gold rush of 1849. The large influx of '49ers,' as the gold prospectors were known, caused California's population to increase dramatically as migrants from across the world came to America to make their fortune. This influx of migrants made it one of the most ethnically diverse states by the middle of the 19th century. Amavisca, a 38-year-old from Sacramento who recently left the military, has been prospecting several times a week this winter - a time when it's usually raining and river levels are too high for gold panning. Leaning over a bed of rocks, Amavisca reached into the river and scooped shovelfuls of sand into a plastic bucket. He and his daughter then poured the sand into a sluice box that's used to trap gold flakes on textured rubber mats. 'If you see a good-sized flake, that's when you get excited,' said Amavisca, as he looked for gold in one of the sluice box trays. Rudy Price walked along the dry rocks of the Bear River with a shovel and pan, surveying the riverbed for good spots for prospecting. 'I do understand that it's a dramatic impact on everybody during a drought that's this severe, but at the same token I'm taking advantage of it,' said Price, 39, an amateur prospector who lives in the Colfax area. One of the worst droughts in . California history has prompted the state and federal governments to . severely cut water supplies to farms and cities. It's also left rivers and streams at dangerously low levels, imperiling fish and wildlife. 'You're . seeing flows that are either at or near record lows,' said Jeff . Kitchen, a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's California . Water Science Center. 'If this drought were to continue into future years, there could be some severe consequences.' The drought has exposed old roads, bridges, railway lines and junked cars that are usually submerged in lakes and reservoirs. At . the Folsom Lake reservoir, the water's retreat revealed the remnants of . a Gold Rush mining town called Mormon Island, which was flooded when . the dam was built in the 1950s. In mountain rivers and streams, the record-low flows have uncovered new chances to earn some extra money. Heather Willis, manager of the Pioneer Mining Supply Co., of Auburn,Calif., goes over a map of areas open to gold panning with prospective gold prospector Glenn Serenbetz . The various tools needed for gold panning are displayed for sale at the shop . The warm, dry winter is bringing in many first-time prospectors to Pioneer Mining Supplies in the Gold Rush-era town of Auburn. The store sells shovels, buckets, pans, rubber boots, maps and mining books, as well as more advanced prospecting equipment such as sluice boxes and gold concentrators. With good jobs in short supply and gold selling for more than $1,300 an ounce, many local residents are prospecting to supplement their incomes, said store manager Heather Willis. Her father, Frank Sullivan, who opened the mining store nearly 40 years ago, said business has increased 20 to 25 percent because of the drought. But he's concerned about the lack of rain because he lives in the mountains and worries about forest fires. 'It's great for business, but I'd rather see no drought and a lot of rain,' Sullivan said. Sullivan sold a 4-foot metal sluice box to amateur prospector Trevor Whitehead and his friend. 'The word is definitely out,' Whitehead said. 'We've seen more people prospecting than usual.' He said water levels at the North Fork of the American River are about 2 feet below normal, which has opened up new areas for gold panning. 'It's more of a hobby,' Whitehead said, 'but obviously if we hit a nice pocket, then yeah, I would love to make some money.'","Low water levels have led to a mini gold rush in the Sierra Nevada foothills .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Changes: Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick said that anti-terrorist policing was seen a decade ago as 'the macho end of a macho organisation' Muslim families in Britain are reporting their sons and brothers to police if they fear they will leave to fight in Syria, it was revealed today. Scotland Yard has announced a large increase in arrests of world-be jihadists this year as it embarks on a more ‘sensitive’ and ‘less macho’ approach to fighting terrorism. The London force says families, officers and community leaders are working better together – and this is being partly put down to an all-female leadership in Britain’s anti-terrorist police team. More Syria-related arrests have happened . since the start of 2014 than in all 2013, which police say is down to . parents who would rather their sons were arrested in Britain than killed . fighting. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick told The Times: ‘We’re getting lots of support from families who are ringing up and saying they are worried about their brother, son, sister sometimes, friend or indeed from other sources of information and intelligence. 'We [have] certainly got a lot more information and a lot more concerned people. 'We want to increase the proportion of people that would contact us, but we are getting a lot of calls for help.’ Miss Dick - Britain’s most senior woman officer - has two female deputies in Helen Ball, national co-ordinator of anti-terror investigations and Patricia Gallan, head of security and protection. Devastation: A man walks through a destroyed residential area of the Saraqib, south-west of Aleppo, Syria . Destructiuon: Syrians search for survivors amidst the rubble after an airstrike in Shaar, Aleppo, last December . Smoke rises: Damaged buildings next to a mosque on the right in the besieged area of Homs, Syria, on Sunday . She added that anti-terrorist policing . was seen a decade ago as ‘the macho end of a macho organisation’, but . there is now more focus on being ‘in tune with the communities we’re . serving’. While terror arrests are rising, there has been a sharp fall in stop-and-searches for counter-terrorism purposes - and there are now fewer major armed operations, reported The Times. These include the botched fatal shooting of Brazilian man Jean Charles de Menezes at Stockwell Underground station in South London in 2005 - which was overseen by 53-year-old Miss Dick. 'We have certainly got a lot more information and a lot more concerned people' Cressida Dick, Metropolitan Police . Now, UK officials fear that Britons who have fought with militants in Syria will return more radicalised, with both new paramilitary skills and with direct contacts to Al Qaeda or its affiliates. US and UK officials say hundreds of British citizens have travelled to Syria to join anti-government rebels - and as many as 100 Britons are in Syria fighting with militants at any time.

"By . Tara Brady . Chinese police were shocked to discover a seemingly super-strong prostitute who ran away before sprinting up a tree to escape was actually a man dressed in women's clothing. The incident happened during a purge of prostitutes in the red light district in the city of Nanning in south China’s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The officers decided to stage the crackdown after local media highlighted that the number of street workers was spiralling out of control and that many of the girls were openly plying their trade on the streets. Chinese police were shocked to discover a seemingly super-strong prostitute who ran away before sprinting up a tree to escape was actually a man dressed in women's clothing . However, after rounding up a group of girls, one of them suddenly shoved police out of the way and sprinted off before three officers chased her. Police spokesman Kuan-Yin Tsai said: 'She did not run like a woman, she was very fast and managed to jump over a fence much more efficiently than the officers – but when she realised there were police in front of her as well she climbed up a tree like a cat, and refused to come down.'

He said that after checking 33 of the girls arrested that night they discovered that actually three of them were men dressed up as women who were offering oral sex to clients which has shocked many in China.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Four people were arrested this morning on suspicion of terror offences linked to Syria. The suspects, men and women aged between 18 and 29, were arrested by counter-terrorism officers on suspicion of being involved in travelling to or supporting fighting in war zones. Two men aged 29 and 18, both from Levenshulme, Greater Manchester, and a 21-year-old woman from Trafford, were held today. Officers also arrested a 29-year-old man from Oxford. Statement: Greater Manchester Police (whose headquarters are pictured) said officers investigating people suspected of being involved in travelling to or supporting fighting in war-zones made four arrests today . Fire: A file picture of flames rising from buildings hit by a government forces airstrike in Kfar Takharim, Syria . They were detained on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. A number of properties were also being searched, police said. Police said today’s arrests were not linked to any domestic terror threat. Detective Chief Superintendent Tony Mole, head of the force’s North West Counter-Terrorism Unit, said: ‘First and foremost I should reassure everyone that none of today’s activity is linked in any way to any imminent threats in Greater Manchester or the UK. ‘The operation has been running since autumn 2013 since we first became aware of a number of individuals travelling from the North West to the battlefields of Syria. ‘You may have seen headlines in recent months linking people from Manchester to Syria and you will naturally have been concerned about this. ‘Like other major cities across the UK we have been aware for some time of people travelling to war-torn places for terrorism-related purposes. This is not a problem unique to Manchester or the North West - it is an issue that affects different communities across the country and elsewhere.’ Devastation and destruction: Damaged buildings are seen in the besieged area of Homs, Syria, on Sunday . Mr Mole said travelling to a war zone in order to be involved in conflict - or supporting those who do so - could make them potentially liable to prosecution for terrorism offences. He said: ‘As well as posing a risk to themselves, there is the very real threat that they could pose a danger to our own communities when they return to the UK. 'As well as posing a risk to themselves, there is the very real threat that they could pose a danger to our own communities when they return to the UK' Detective Chief Superintendent Tony Mole, Greater Manchester Police . ‘There is naturally widespread concern about the situation in Syria and other conflict zones and the way that some will be driven to travel there to engage in humanitarian work or to take part in the fighting. We know that some have already lost their lives or been detained by the regime and badly treated. ‘There are serious concerns that anyone travelling to Syria, whether for humanitarian reasons or because of a desire to support the Syrian opposition, may be targeted by extremist groups who want to recruit them. This could have serious repercussions for the safety of the individual concerned. ‘By travelling there people will be causing distress and anxiety to their families and friends, not to mention the wider community.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Suspects are three men aged 18, 29 and 29 - and a woman aged 21 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Most people would expect to indulge a little over Christmas, but it might be surprising to hear the average person could have eaten a staggering 6,000 calories yesterday - nearly three times the recommended intake. And festive revellers have been warned, they may not realise the Olympic lengths they need to go to compensate for their Christmas feasting. A new study has shown you would have to exercise like a champion to burn off those extra festive calories. Feeling full: A traditional Christmas dinner alone can contain 1,500 calories, just a quarter of the total amount some may have consumed yesterday . The study found it would take gold medal-winning cyclist Victoria Pendleton 2,177 laps of the Olympic Velodrome to burn off the 6,000 calories some may have consumed yesterday. While cycling hero Bradley Wiggins would have to ride 41 miles, the distance from London to Southend, to burn off the 1,500 calories found in an average Christmas dinner alone. Eating too much over Christmas is a festive hazard but few people realise the Olympic lengths they need to go to to burn off the extra calories. A new study shows that revellers must exercise like a champion if they want to compensate for their Christmas indulgence. An average person could eat a staggering 6,000 calories on Christmas Day - almost treble the recommended intake. Using up the excess energy is a challenge of Olympic proportions - it would take gold medal-winning cyclist Victoria Pendleton 2,177 laps of the Olympic Velodrome to burn off. Huge effort: It would take Olympic gold medallist Victoria Pendleton more than 2,000 laps of the velodrome to burn off 6,000 calories . Olympic Gold medallist Victoria Pendleton however doesn't recommend tackling all that in one go. She said: 'Some 2,177 laps of the Olympic . Velodrome would be a bit too much, even for me . 'I recommend building in exercise to . your everyday routine and making it fun. A cycle ride to the local shops . is good for you, it also saves on petrol, there’s no struggle to find a . parking space and it’s enjoyable too.' The study found Christmas dinner alone - containing an average of 1,500 calories - would equate to Bradley Wiggins cycling 41 miles - the distance from London to Southend to burn off the calories. The study for Halfords also found that at 600 calories a bottle of festive champagne would be the same as Mo Farah’s 10k run. And the GB's volleyball team would have to play for a full hour to work off the 200 calories in a prawn cocktail.

Meanwhile, if he wanted second helpings, calculated to be an average of 500 calories, Greg Rutherford would have to spend an hour extra long jumping to compensate. Halfords has also said a helping of Christmas pudding equates to a Michael Phelps-inspired 2,470 metre swim – 50 lengths of the Olympic pool. Professional cyclist Rob Jarman, who has worked with the bike retailer to create a more viable fitness routine, said the key to shedding Christmas excess is a sustain plan that is quick and enjoyable. He said: 'Burning 6,000 calories seems a scary challenge so it's more easily tackled over a longer period in a series of activities that burn 500 calories through the day - such as a 30 minute bike ride at a high intensity. 'What’s important is to get out and be active on a regular basis - we don't all have to go to Olympian lengths to shed the weight.' Karen Bellairs, cycles manager at Halfords, said:'We know that more and more people are taking up cycling as a way to stay fit and have fun. 'So we wanted to see how cycling fitted into the Christmas fitness regime. It was amazing to find the lengths you have to go to, to burn off your Christmas dinner.'","Study finds average person could have consumer 6,000 calories yesterday .

"By . Meghan Keneally . and Snejana Farberov . Hollywood heavyweight Harvey Weinstein has produced some of the most violent films to hit the silver screen in the last 30 years, but he says that’s all in the past now. Speaking to CNN's Piers Morgan on Friday, Weinstein pledged to choose projects that 'aren’t violent or as violent as they used to be' as he gears up to make a film that takes aim at the National Rifle Association. Since announcing the as yet untitled project starring screen legend Meryl Streep this week, Weinstein has come under sharp criticism from gun rights advocates. Scroll down for video . Big change: Hollywood heavyweight Harvey Weinstein, who has produced such bloody films as Pulp Fiction and Gangs of New York, announced on the Piers Morgan Show that he will stay away from excessively violent projects . Country singer and right-wing activist Ted Nugent compared Weinstein, who is Jewish and a Democrat, to a Nazi propagandist and called him 'brain-dead’ for his anti-gun position. Weinstein told Morgan he was inspired to take on a project carrying a strong anti-gun message in the wake of the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut that claimed the lives of 20 children and six adults. Republican Senator Ted Cruz wasted no time calling the head of the studio that produced so many of Quentin Tarantino's blood-soaked blockbusters, including Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained, a hypocrite. The Texas lawmaker singled out Tarantino's 2003 film Kill Bill, also produced by the Weinstein Company,  calling the final sword fight ‘one of the most epically violent scenes,’ Politico reported. ‘But you don’t see people wanting to ban knives,’ Cruz said Thursday on Fox News’s On the Record with Greta Van Susteren. Intent on proving that he has the courage of his convictions, Mr Weinstein made a pledge Friday night on the Piers Morgan Show to stay away from excessive gun violence in his films going forward. blood brothers: Eisenstein is a long-time collaborator of Quentin Tarantino, and over the years he has produced such uber-violent cult classics as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs . ‘Well, I think they have a point. You have to look in the mirror, too,’ Weinstein said. ‘The change starts here, it has already.’ When asked by the interviewer to expand on his pledge, the movie mogul clarified that he is not going to 'make some crazy action movie just to blow people up and exploit people.' The mega-producer mentioned his plan to make an the anti-gun film with Streep during an interview with radio host Howard Stern. 'I shouldn’t say this, but I’ll tell it to you, Howard. I’m going to make a movie with Meryl Streep, and we’re going to take this head-on,' he said Wednesday. In cahoots: Harvey Weinstein said that he and Meryl Streep, his frequent star, will be working on a movie that lampoons the NRA and the gun industry . 'They’re going to wish they weren’t alive after I’m done with them,' he said of the gun industry. He said that it will not be a documentary but a 'big movie like a ""Mr Smith Goes to Washington,""' he said without giving away any plot details. Weinstein, 61, made it clear that his motive is political as he is openly against the use of guns. 'I don’t think we need guns in this country. And I hate it. I think the NRA is a disaster area,' he said. He said that his intention is to make the movie such a condemnation of the use of guns in America that the ammunition industry would take a noticeable hit afterwards. Weinstein said that people will be leaving the movie theater thinking 'Gun stocks — I don’t want to be involved in that stuff'. Democrat: Weinstein- seen in 2006 with President Obama, the late Senator Frank Lautenberg, and Senator chuck Schumer- held a fundraiser for President Obama in 2012 . 'It’s going to be like crash and burn.' The topic came up when Stern asked about his plans to direct a film based on a book about the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto during the Holocaust, but used it as a basis to explain his feelings on guns. 'It's not a Holocaust story as much as it is Jews with guns. It's my whole philosophy. It's the idea that when injustice is that great you can't just march into the camps,' he said. 'I never want to have a gun... This is when you're marching a half a million people into Auschwitz. I'd find a gun if that was happening to my people.' Less obvious: Meryl Streep has not been politically active like Weinstein, but was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Obama in 2010 . The Miramax founder has never been shy about his left-leaning political allegiances as he hosted a $2.5million fundraiser for President Obama at his Westport, Connecticut home in August 2012. He also spoke about gun control that summer in the led up to the 2012 election, telling the Huffington Post: ‘If we don’t get gun-control laws in this country, we are full of beans. To have the National Rifle Association rule the United States of America is pathetic.’ Though Meryl Streep has kept her political beliefs much more closely guarded, she has not remained as tight-lipped in her adoration of Mr Weinstein. During her 2012 Golden Globes acceptance speech for her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher, Streep jokingly called Weinstein ‘God, the punisher’.","Mega-producer revealed his plans to make a film to help battle the gun industry and the NRA .

"By . Amanda Williams . A primary school teacher has died from a blood clot just four months after she got married. Helen Thompson, 28, was told she had a clot on her brain, believed to have been caused by the contraceptive pill, and died within 24 hours of being diagnosed. Her devastated widower, James, from Long Wittenham, Oxfordshire, said they were childhood sweethearts who had met when hey were 12. 'She has been my best friend since I was 12 years old, and my partner since we were 18,' he said. Newlywed primary school teacher Helen Thompson died weeks after marrying her childhood sweetheart and just hours after discovering she had a deadly blood clot .

Her distraught widower James said: 'She has been my best friend since I was 12 years old, and my partner since we were 18' 'The . doctors said she might have been at a higher risk of a blood clot . because she was on the pill, but no-one knows for sure what caused it. 'When I left her one day she was fine and the next day she was dead, I still don’t believe it. We had just got married. She left me loving me, wanting me, with me wanting her and loving her. We loved each other so much.' Mrs Thompson suffered a violent seizure at home after suffering hyper-sensitivity in her feet for several weeks. After a brain scan on December 11, plans were put in place her to have emergency surgery at Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital. But The blood clot had caused a haemorrhage. Just two hours later, doctors told her family there was nothing more they could do for her and she passed away that day. Mr Thompson, a bricklayer, said: 'The doctors said they had never . seen a case like this before. It was just so fast. Because she was on . the contraceptive pill, she was at a higher risk of clots, but this was . very rare. 'It was a very scary situation. They hoped they could operate, but it had spread so much it was impossible to do anything. It was just so fast, literally a few hours. She never woke up again.'

A decision has not yet been made by him or IDV about how the money will be spent but it could be used to build a school.

"By . Amanda Williams . John Catlin feared he would have to have his foot amputated after he was bitten by a false widow spider . A grandfather has told how he fought for his life - and his leg -  after being bitten by one of Britain's most venomous spiders, leaving him with horrific injuries. John Catlin feared he would have to have his foot amputated after he was bitten by a false widow spider, which are currently believed to be plaguing Britain. The infection caused by the creature's bite was so bad his vital organs started 'shutting down'  as it spread throughout his body. Mr Catlin, 66, was bitten on the toe by the spider while making a bonfire at his home in Bromley, Kent, last year. He said he had brushed aside the small bite at first but soon became desperately unwell. He told the Star that he began to shiver and feel strange and so drove to the doctors. But by the time he arrived he was so weak he could barely drive. His temperature had reached 104degrees and concerned medics quickly called for an ambulance. At first doctors believed the father of two was suffering from food poisoning, but his condition soon deteriorated and he was finally diagnosed with cellulitis, a severe skin infection. He said: 'Over the two weeks I stayed in hospital, I was all swollen up and my leg turned dark red with huge blisters. 'At one point my organs started shutting down and I had real problems with my kidneys. 'One night my heart was racing like a marathon runner and I needed injections from doctors.' He said he 'wanted to die' and was . later told he was close to losing his leg after developing a . streptococcal infection in the bite, which spread around his body, and . to his other leg. He has spent the past year recovering from the ordeal but still struggles to walk. Mr Catlin's ordeal has emerged as the number of reported sightings and bites from false widows has exploded in recent weeks. Decorator Ricki Whitmore, 39, almost . lost his leg when he suffered a horrific bite from Britain's most . poisonous spider after disturbing a nest of false widows while working . at a school. Surgeons were forced to slice open his leg and flush out the venom after his thigh swelled to twice its normal size. Mr Catlin, 66, (pictured here holding an image of his injury and a jar containing a spider) was bitten on the toe by the spider while making a bonfire at his home in Bromley, Kent, last year . And Steve Harris, a 22-year-old  footballer from Devon also needed emergency surgery after a nasty bite from the spider. He . said: 'When I woke up I had a pain in my side - a stinging feeling. I . didn't take that much notice until it started swelling and the pain got . worse. 'I was in agony. I . have never had pain like that before in my life. It's still very . painful now. I still can't sleep properly and find it virtually . impossible to get in and out of a car.' There . are fears that with temperatures outside plummeting as the winter . months approach, millions of the spiders could make their way into homes . across the country to escape the cold. Traditionally they were only found in the south of England, but there are nests being found in Wales and Scotland. Experts believe that the spiders my be thriving in the UK because of a wet start to the summer followed by a heatwave. Long-term climate change may also be to blame, leading spiders to set up home in new areas. However, some experts say many sightings of false widows could in fact be the common house spider. He was close to losing his leg after developing a streptococcal infection in the bite, which spread around his body . And today an entire school announced it will close for a day to deal with an outbreak of False Widows. The Dean Academy, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, will be shut while its buildings are fumigated after the creatures were found in its computer block as well as other areas. A statement said the school 'had identified an issue with false widow spiders' in several buildings including ICT rooms. Parents were sent a letter from vice principal Craig Burns saying the school would be shut on the advice of pest controllers. Initially a decision was taken to close only the ICT block, but further discoveries of the spiders elsewhere led to a full school closure. Mr Burns wrote: 'We have identified an issue with false widow spiders in the academy in our ICT block and therefore took immediate advice from pest control. 'We therefore made the decision to close the ICT block for the whole of today so that pest control could fumigate the area. 'Unfortunately, during this afternoon there have been further false widow spiders identified in other areas of the academy. 'We have taken advice from the Health and Safety unit at Gloucestershire Local Authority and C & D Pest Control, Chepstow and have taken the decision to close the academy all day on Wednesday 23rd October 2013. 'This will enable pest control to fumigate every area in the academy and ensure everyone's health and safety.' The spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns. Millions . of false widows, pictured right, Britain's most poisonous spider, are . found across the UK and the population is growing. Also known as steatoda nobilis, it is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom. The false widow was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879. It is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas. The . species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a . skull. They have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size. The . Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is . spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in . southern England. This theory is backed by its wildlife surveys where people report sightings to them.HOW TO AVOID BITES AND WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET ONE . The . key message is that you shouldn't disturb spiders if you can help it . because they will usually only bite you if they feel threatened. To . avoid it while asleep, remove everything from under the bed so that the . only way the spiders can get up on the bed is to crawl up one of the . four legs. Do not leave . clothes around in piles for long periods as spiders like to hide in . them and shake shoes in case a spider has crawled in overnight. If . you have a garage store things in plastic bags if you use them with . your hands and feet and cannot see inside. Also seal cardboard boxes if . you are storing things. If you are unfortunate enough to be bitten and have a reaction, pack the wound in ice and seek medical attention.","John Catlin feared he would have foot amputated after he was bitten .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A woman who had been anorexic for more than a decade says her life was saved when she miraculously managed to become pregnant. Jess Astill, 22, discovered she was expecting after she was sent to hospital by doctors who were concerned her eating disorder was out of control. At the time she weighed just 5st 1lb. Jess Astill, 22, became pregnant with Cassandra, two, despite being anorexic and weighing just 5st 1lb . The sudden shock of discovering she was pregnant gave her the determination to beat anorexia for good. Miss Astill, of Torquay, Devon, said: ‘My first thought was, “what have I done?” I was heartbroken to think I had been harming not only myself, but also my baby. ‘From the very first second I realised I was pregnant, I started caring for my daughter with my whole heart.’ While she was pregnant, doctors told Miss Astill that a miscarriage was inevitable unless she beat her eating disorder. But today Cassandra, her daughter with her partner Alan Foster, 32, a plasterer, is a happy, healthy two-year-old. Miss Astill suffered with anorexia from childhood. When she was just nine years old she was . admitted to hospital for three months because she had stopped eating . and her weight had dropped dangerously low. Miss Astill only discovered she was pregnant when she was admitted to hospital because her anorexia was out of control and her health was fading. She was told a miscarriage was inevitable unless she started eating . Miss Astill says learning she was pregnant gave her the motivation to recover as she was heartbroken at the thought she could have harmed her unborn baby . She said: ‘My mum struggled with anorexia and, observing her, I thought it was a grown-up thing to do to find excuses not to eat. ‘We didn’t eat regular meals at home. Even though my parents were worried about me and it was a challenge, I found ways to stop eating. Melanie Brown, a nutritionist at the Harley Street Fertility Clinic, told MailOnline that between their teens and mid-20s, women are often very fertile. This is likely to explain how Miss Astill managed to conceive, despite her anorexia. She explained that an older woman would be very unlikely to conceive if she was so underweight. This is because the female sex hormone oestrogen is produced in fatty tissue - so a low body weight means the hormone is not able to work properly. She says that even if an underweight woman does conceive, it is unlikely she will have enough hormones to sustain a pregnancy. Oestrogen drives the menstrual cycle and is important in ovulation so having too little means conception is unlikely. It also causes the womb lining to thicken so women who have low oestrogen levels may conceive but may not be able to sustain a pregnancy as their womb lining could be too thin. Ms Brown said: ‘Young girls are very fertile but it is unusual for someone very underweight to conceive. ‘Being underweight is also a big risk factor for pregnancy and it would certainly not be recommended.’ Many people also stop menstruating if they lose weight. Ms Brown explained: 'You have to lay down fat to sustain a pregnancy - for both the hormones to continue the pregnancy and also as nutrition to nourish the baby. 'That is why you tend to stop menstruating if you are underweight as your body doesn’t have the nutrition to sustain a baby – it’s probably an evolutionary thing. ‘Some underweight people still have periods but are not ovulating or do not have enough hormones to sustain a pregnancy. Just having periods isn’t necessarily enough.’ The nutritionist explained that even . if a pregnancy is successful, an underweight mother is likely to have a . baby with a low birth weight and this is a risk factor for . cardiovascular problems in old age. She . added that being pregnant while on a restricted diet can also pose a . risk to the mother as it can put her at greater risk of conditions such . as osteoporosis. ‘Being in the hospital was horrible. There were no other children my age there and I felt completely alone. ‘As I got older, my friends started spending time together out of school. But the eating disorder - for which I was having fortnightly check-up appointments with my doctor - held me back. I didn’t have any confidence. ‘I wanted to be normal, but I didn’t know how.’ Miss Astill met Mr Foster when she was 17 and the joy of being in a loving relationship for the first time seemed to offer a way out of the cycle. She said: ‘I was able to start a new . life. As I started eating, I got more energy and confidence. I’d always . felt like the odd one out but for the first time in my life, I felt as . if I fitted in.’ But having reached a stable weight of 7st 4lb, Miss Astill’s world was shattered when her parents divorced in 2011. She said: ‘Mum moved away with my little brother and we didn’t have regular contact for a couple of years. ‘I’d . been able to talk to her about my struggles with eating because she’d . suffered with similar problems but now I was with my dad and I didn’t . feel as if he understood me. ‘I . started avoiding meals again. Alan noticed I was off my food but I . relied on the old tricks I’d learned when I was a child to relapse into . anorexia. ‘I made any . excuse not to sit with him at mealtimes - I would take my dinner plate . into the kitchen and hide it away in there. Sometimes I snuck food away . under the dinner table. ‘We often ate meals in front of the . TV, so it was relatively easy to go back into the bad habits because not . all the attention was on me.’ Over . several months, Miss Astill’s weight fell to just 5st 1lb, prompting . concerned doctors to arrange for her admission to hospital, where she . was put on a drip. She . said: ‘I began vomiting shortly before I went into hospital. It was . strange because when I’d stopped eating before I hadn’t been so unwell. This time I just wasn’t getting any better. ‘I was worried. I knew I was in a bad way. The doctors put me on a drip because they were worried about my fading health. ‘They . did test after test, but each one returned negative results. The only . test left was a pregnancy test, but I knew I wasn’t pregnant. I’d always . had light, irregular periods and I’d been told that my eating problems . meant it was very unlikely I could conceive. ‘So when I discovered I was pregnant, I was stunned. I was crying and hysterical. ‘I couldn’t get over the idea that I . was damaging my daughter.

"By . Jill Reilly . Children in a Japanese city are banned from using their mobile phones after 9pm in a bid to fight cyber bullying. From April 13,000 schoolchildren, aged between six and 15, living in Kariya city, Aiichi prefecture will not be allowed to use their phones in the evening. It is hoped the initiative will prevent them from getting sucked into cyberspace crimes, spending long hours exchanging mobile e-mails and suffering other negative effects of mobile phone overuse. Children in a Japanese city are banned from using their mobile phones after 9pm in a bid to fight cyber bullying . The initiative is the brainchild of teachers, social workers and police, although parents will not face any penalties if their children do not comply, according to Japanese media reports. Parents are being directly requested to remove . smartphones after 9pm and monitor the websites they access as part of the campaign across 21 schools, reported The Telegraph. A spokesperson for the board of education in Kariya was quoted saying the programme is aimed at protecting children from getting into trouble or being bullied via free instant message apps. Parents are being directly requested to remove smartphones after 9pm and monitor the websites they access as part of the initiative across 21 schools . A few weeks ago the government released statistics showing the high level use of mobile phones by by Japanese children. It revealed that schoolchildren aged between 10 and 17 were spending an average of 107.4 minutes a day on-line on their phones. The idea of limiting the amount children use their phones in Japan was first floated in 2008. The concern surrounding cyber-bullying is international. A recent survey found that more than half of children and young people in England accept cyber-bullying as a part of everyday life. But parents and teachers say they do not feel they are equipped to deal with the growing problem of internet abuse. Campaigners warned that cyber bullying had become 'an everyday problem for today's children' and demanded better education to tackle the phenomenon.","13,000 schoolchildren, aged between six and 15, living in Kariya city, Aiichi .

"By . Andrew Levy . It's tough being a leading advocate for healthy eating when you’re also one of the world’s favourite celebrity chefs. But Jamie Oliver appeared to be practising what he preaches during a trip to Australia. His new slimmed-down look was in stark contrast to the rather portly figure he cut six months earlier when he was spotted in London. Jamie Oliver was much slimmer when photographed yesterday, left, compared to back in September, right . The difference was emphasised by the fact he wore the same clothes on both occasions. Back in September, his short-sleeved shirt seemed stretched at the midriff as he strolled through the capital in trendy Birkenstock sandals. But in Sydney yesterday, his stomach appeared washboard flat. There was also less evidence of a double chin. He was filming an episode of a cooking special on the steps of the Sydney Opera House, two days after stopping in Perth to visit the most successful restaurant of his international Jamie’s Italian chain. Jamie Oliver had a minor mishap while filming an episode of a cooking special outside the Sydney Opera House . Jamie has been freinds with Tobie Puttock, who appears with him in the new show, for 15 years . Oliver, 38, has campaigned for people to use fresh food and eat sensibly. He has also criticised the government for not doing enough to tackle obesity. But he has struggled with his weight in the past - and is a little touchy on the subject. Two years ago - during another visit to Australia - he bristled when asked by a female reporter if he had put on a few pounds, calling her a b****. The father-of-four, who is worth £150 million, said at the time he tried to watch his weight and worked out twice a week but admitted there was room for improvement. He added: ‘I do my best. Working in the food business is quite hard when someone is constantly asking you to try things. ‘I eat fresh. I train twice a week. I could definitely do better but I am trying to do my best like most people when they hit 30.’","Jamie Oliver looks much slimmer than six months ago .

"By . Louise Boyle . A woman who suffered from a rare condition which made her grow into a 6ft 11ins giant has died suddenly at the age of 34. Tanya Angus, from Las Vegas, spent the last 12 years trying to find a cure for her acromegaly, which meant she couldn't stop growing. Until the age of 21, Tanya was just 5ft 8ins tall and weighed 130lbs. She rode horses, went dancing and had a boyfriend. Scroll down for video . Rare disorder: Tanya Angus was a slender 5ft 8 and 130lbs as a teenager, pictured here in 1995 (left). By 2010 (right), she was 6ft 6in and more than 400lbs. She died suddenly today at the age of 34 . An inspiration: Tanya Angus celebrates her 34th birthday with a friend on November 27, 2012 . Struggle: Miss Angus has died at the age of 34 after her heart failed due to her extreme size . But a tumour became wrapped around her pituitary gland, causing massive amounts of growth hormone to be released into her body. Tanya, . who became wheelchair-bound, had the most extreme form of acromegaly . ever seen, growing to nearly 7ft tall, and more than 400lbs. Ms Angus, who had been working as a . supervisor at a Walmart in Michigan, was fired from her post when her condition worsened, and was dumped by her boyfriend when his parents . questioned whether she was a man. But . she never gave up searching for a treatment to halt her incredible . growth and hoped she could one day have a more normal life. In . August last year, it seemed like Tanya and her family had finally seen a . breakthrough, when a blood test revealed that her growth hormone levels . had fallen at last. Tanya's . mother Karen Strutynski said at the time: 'For the first time ever, . Tanya's blood level for her disease is in the normal range. 'It gives us renewed hope and will give other people renewed hope.' Sorrow: A message was posted on Tanya Angus's website that she had sadly passed away on January 14 . New treatment: The 34-year-old was given renewed hope for her condition last year but it was not to last . The . good news was short-lived. Tanya's Insulin-like Growth Factor levels, . which had fallen from 3,000 at the worst of her condition to just 283, . had started to creep back up into the 500's. The normal range for a . healthy person is around 250. It is thought the extreme pressure on her body, caused by 12 years of coping with her huge size,  caused her heart to fail. Acromegaly, which affects 20,000 people in the U.S., is usually caused by a non-cancerous tumour on the pituitary gland. Ms Angus had undergone radiation and surgery three times in an effort to have hers removed, but, as it is wrapped around her carotid artery, it has proved too difficult. If left untreated, acromegaly can be life-threatening, as it causes organs such as the heart and lungs to grow along with height and weight. Sufferers are at higher risk of developing diabetes and high blood pressure, while the pressure on their joints causes swelling and early onset of osteoarthritis. A . notice on Tanya's website, which has inspired and helped acromegaly . sufferers around the world, reads simply: 'It is with deep sorrow that . we announce the passing on of our beloved Tanya Angus at 12.25am on . January 14, 2013, due to her heart and TIA. RIP dear one' Transient . Ischemic Attack (TIA) is a type of mini-stroke, caused when the blood . flow to the brain stops for a period of time. Tanya had suffered a . number of TIAs in recent years. Describing . her acromegaly last year, Tanya said: 'Sometimes I feel really down . about it but to me the most important thing is that I have to tell . people about it. 'I read . emails that people send in saying: ''You're my inspiration,'' or, ''You . are so strong.'' 'If I am helping other people, I feel I can do . anything.' Tanya, whose . condition caused her to spend many hours sleeping, found her outlet . through her website, which helped her gain friends around the world. Last . year, she was able to meet some of them for the first time at an . Acromegaly Conference in Las Vegas, where fellow sufferers told Tanya . how hearing her story had caused them to seek early treatment, and . possibly saved their lives. During . the last 12 years, Tanya underwent three operations to attempt to . remove her tumour, but several different surgeons were unable to reach . part of the growth, as it was wrapped around her inner carotid artery. Her heart, lungs and the joints of her limbs continued to grow as she gained weight and height, causing huge strain on her body. Change: Photographs of Ms Angus ages 17 (left) and 31 (right) reveal how acromegaly has affected her face . Healthier times: Before her acromegaly diagnosis, Ms Angus was a keen horserider . Her . mother Karen and stepfather Allan continued to search for new ways of . tackling her condition, and last year doctors finally agreed to double . the dose of Tanya's growth inhibitor medication, which was administered . by painful injections into her spine. The treatment seemed to finally be . working, until the sad news in October that her growth hormone levels . were rising again. Tanya, . talking in 2009 about the slow onset of her growth said: 'I couldn't . understand why, as I wasn't eating more. What was strange was that my . feet seemed to grow as well. My face also started to swell and was . changing. 'I felt unhappy . with my appearance and spent a fortune on make-up. My figure also . started to change and become more manly and my voice became deeper.' The . 34-year-old, who loved jewellery and enjoyed regular swimming sessions . which helped her body feel weightless, continued to remain hopeful . throughout her life. 'Without hope you don't have anything,' she is quoted as saying. 'I hope they can stop me growing one day.' Helping hands: Ms Angus pictured with her medical team and her mother (in white) in 2010 .

If you look very closely, there are strings attached to this festive scene. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Stratos-sleigh: Old Saint Nick and Rudolph orbiting high above the Earth . Flying: Santa and his trusted reindeer were attached to a weather balloon . In fact, the real Father Christmas was probably hard at work in Lapland while this toy version was sent into space. But . there was still a fair bit of Christmas magic involved in making this . flight happen. With the elves all busy helping the real Santa, it took . council worker Mark Ireland, 26, and his girlfriend Cassie Phelps to get . his miniature counterpart airborne. The pair attached a high . altitude weather balloon to their model Santa, along with a camera and a . GPS tracker, and watched it rise to dizzying heights. The sleigh launched from the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, and flew to 100,000ft above the Earth's surface as it started the journey around the globe. But the trip came to a disastrous end . when the helium filled balloon - which cost around £50 - popped and its . passengers started to fall to the ground. The flight was made possible by the pair of science fans, who attached him to a high altitude weather balloon. Mr Ireland and Miss Phelps also installed a camera which captured incredible views of the planet's curvature as the they flew. A parachute then opened and it slowed down before landing 70 miles away in Yeovil. Miss Phelps, 27, said: 'It is a personal project which we have been working on. We watched a Lego man go into space on YouTube and thought 'let's have a go'. Cloudy: They tried to replicate the journey Father Christmas would take on December 24 .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A little boy with an extreme allergy to all food survives on a diet of just boiled sweets. Finley Ranson suffers from a rare eating disorder which means he is unable to eat normal food without having an extreme allergic reaction. The three-year-old's body fights food as if it were a virus, causing him to bleed internally. Sweet tooth: Finley Ranson suffers an extreme allergy to all food and the only thing his body can tolerate is a diet of boiled sweets . He has undergone a series of . genetic tests at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London in a bid to . identify what is causing his rare form of eosinophilic enterocolitis. Now Finley, from Battlesbridge, Essex, has adapted to living on a diet of eating 10 Fox's Glacier sweets every day. His mother, Rhys, 27, has even taken to melting down the boiled sweets into 'ice lollies' to make them more appetising for her little boy. Despite his heartbreaking condition, she says Finley is always smiling and, surprisingly, his favourite places to go to are pubs and Nando's chicken restaurants. Brave: Finley with his mother, Rhys. She says despite his condition, her son is always smiling - even when his Christmas dinner was a cup of ice . Eosinophilic enteropathy is a complicated digestive system disorder in which eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, are found in above-normal amounts in one or more specific places in the digestive system and/or the blood. Eosinophilic enteritis affects the small intestine in particular. When the body wants to attack a substance, such as an allergy-triggering food or airborne allergen, eosinophils respond by moving into the area and releasing a variety of toxins. However, when the body produces too many eosinophils, they can cause chronic inflammation, resulting in tissue damage. Common symptoms may include pain, swelling, skin rash, hives, reflux, choking, difficulty swallowing, nausea, vomitting, loss of appetite, stools containing blood and/or mucus and abdominal cramping. Many people also experience nutritional deficiencies and/or side effects from medications, such as neuropathy (nerve damage) or osteoporosis (decrease in bone mass). But instead of gorging on chicken, he sits with a cup of crushed ice while watching his parents eat. And a Happy Meal from McDonalds for Finley means he can only enjoy the toy. Finley, who has to be fed six times per . day through his tube, has already undergone 10 operations during his . young life to replace or re-locate his feeding tube as well as . exploratory procedures. Rhys only discovered her son was able to eat the Glacier sweets after a tip from another mother at a support group. Up until then, she had tried hundreds of different foods in the desperate search for something Finley might be able to eat without getting seriously ill. It is currently a mystery why his body is able to tolerate the sweets but no other foods. Rhys, 27, has been amazed by her son's positive nature despite the hardships he has faced since he was born. The qualified nursery nurse said: 'Finley cannot eat anything other than boiled sweets. 'We realised they were the one thing he could eat that he did not have a reaction to and he gets through 10 of them every day. 'I have even melted them down and made them into lollies for him, so he's got something a bit different to eat.' His older sister, Georgia, five, also has the same illness which causes a serious allergic reaction to dairy, eggs and soya. Battle: Finley has to be fed through a tube several times a day and has has already undergone 10 operations involving his feeding tube, plus other exploratory procedures . But while she is able to eat other foods, Finley's case is so rare, he cannot eat anything. Instead, he gets his nutrients by having a highly nutritional liquid food formula placed into his stomach through a specialist feeding tube every two-and-a-half hours. Curious: It is currently a mystery why Finley's body is able to tolerate the sweets but no other foods . Rhys, who is now a full time carer to her son, added: 'I am of course biased but he is amazing - he still loved Christmas even though his three-course dinner was just crushed ice, a water lolly and some of his favourite sweets. 'He has to undergo weekly blood tests and he never gets down. 'Because I can't treat him to food it does end up costing me a fortune in other treats - if he sees a magazine he'll end up being bought it - he's totally spoiled. 'Despite his food allergy, he still loves going out and he says his favourite place is the pub. 'He'll sit there with a cup of ice and be quite happy - he's such an inspiration.' Finley's friends and family have helped raise more than Â£10,000 for more research to be carried out. Rhys, whose husband Brett, 31, is a builder, added: 'There weren't any warning signs before we had the children. 'A few members of our families have mild food allergies but nothing like what Finley has. 'It can be tough at times for me because, as a mum, I blame myself, wondering if I was carrying a faulty gene but you just have to get on and deal with it, there is no point dwelling upon it. 'If the research being done does not help Finley, hopefully it will make difference to another family who are going through what we have been through.' Rhys has to always be on full-alert in case Finley's feeding tube breaks as she then only has 20 minutes to get him to hospital to put a replacement in before an operation is needed again to insert one.","Finley Ranson suffers from rare eating disorder eosinophilic enterocolitis .

Chloe Menager, 27, has been convicted by jurors in Dallas, Texas, of holding her son, one-year-old Elijahu Perez, under water in a bathtub until he drowned in September 2012 . Court records show that when police arrived, Menager was in wet, bloodstained clothes, ‘talking on the cellphone, crying and screaming, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, my baby.’” Elijahu was found dead and still wet on a bed inside the apartment. Records show that she told Dallas Fire-Rescue personnel ‘that she killed her baby.’ She told police that she held Elijahu underwater in the bathtub. She also tried to kill herself by slashing her left wrist with a dull knife. In a jailhouse interview shortly after her arrest, she gave religiously critic interviews to FOX4 and the Dallas Morning News in which she spoke of how she was tormented by ‘demons’ and that she had been depressed.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Charged: Jessica Lee Jensen has been arrested for murder and neglect over her son's death . A North Dakota woman has been charged with murder and neglect over the death of her 13-year-old son, who weighed only 21lb when he died. Jessica Lee Jensen's son died from chronic starvation caused by an eating disorder that had not been treated, a medical examiner said. His body was so tiny and underdeveloped that when hospital staff examined him on the day he died, they first believed he was a three-year-old. Jensen, who has two other children aged 14 and 7, told investigators that her son had a hormonal growth problem, and that his pituitary gland did not function properly. The 35-year-old added that her son, identified locally as Aidan Edward Bossingham, had not been to a doctor for several years. The mother-of-three home-schooled her children in a property that was described by police as being filthy and smelling of feces, the Dickson Press reported. She claimed that Aidan had eaten a small amount on the day he died, but the state medical examiner said the boy's stomach was empty. Dr William Massello added there was no evidence of damage to the throat that would indicate recent or regular vomiting. The medical examiner, who listed the death as a homicide, added that the conditions the child had could have been treated. When police were called to the family's home on January 12, they found Jensen sitting on a couch with her son in her arms. Jensen allegedly told a 911 dispatcher her son had 'passed', and an officer struggled to try to give the child mouth-to-mouth resuscitation because rigor mortis had already set in. The first nurse to examine the body said Aidan appeared to have been dead for some time. Although he had been treated in hospital several times when he was younger, medical records showed Aidan was last seen by a doctor in 2008. A human growth hormone deficiency, which can be treated, was diagnosed but medical notes from 2008 reported Aidan had 'very poor growth because of lack of treatment'. Jensen allegedly told police her children did not have a doctor because she was able to 'solve problems', according to court documents. She had been home-schooling her children for years, but police said only one shelf containing primary education materials was found in the house. Relatives also claimed they had been barred from having contact with Aidan after confronting his mother about his condition. Jensen, who could face life in prison if convicted, is next due in court on May 1. Her surviving children are currently living with relatives.","Jessica Lee Jensen accused of not getting medical treatment for her child .

In the complaint, Brooks claims that police officers handcuffed her and refused her request to use the bathroom somewhere else privately. Brooks claims cops handcuffed her and refused her request to use the bathroom somewhere else privately -- and was forced to defecate on her own lawn . Instead, they allegedly said 'just use the restroom right there' referring to the front yard, which she did. Cops also allegedly refused to help her clean up and dress herself. They also reportedly told Brooks to change into a plastic jumpsuit and to take her clothes off in the front yard. The documents allege that police 'looked, yelled, and laughed at' Brooks as she was in various states of undress. In the complaint, Brooks says that she could have used one of the restrooms in the house -- or could have 'used the restroom or gotten undressed and undressed' in a nearby police truck. After she defecated in the front yard, cops allegedly refused to help Brooks clean up and dress herself . Brooks says the alleged incident caused her mental anguish and humiliation and that the police were not properly trained. The claims were dismissed on March 14 when U.S. District Judge Roy Dalton did not find 'any allegation that deliberate indifference was responsible for the city's alleged failure to train,' Courthouse News Service says. The court also said that Brooks did not show the need for training was 'plainly obvious,' based on prior instances. It also said that Brooks failed to identify 'any specific practice or policy that caused the officers to infringe her rights.' Brooks has until April 4 to amend her complaint.","Dawn Brooks says that during a drug raid, she was handcuffed and forced to defecate on her front yard .

"By . Luke Salkeld . PUBLISHED: . 07:21 EST, 4 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:05 EST, 4 October 2012 . Accused: Stephen Farrow, 48, is on trial for murdering a vicar and a retired teacher . A killer scattered gay DVDs, a Bible and party popper streamers over the body of a murdered vicar, a court heard yesterday. Stephen Farrow, 48, then stayed at the vicarage for several hours watching an Indiana Jones DVD and drinking beer. The stabbed body of Reverend John Suddards, 59, was later discovered by workmen next to a carefully propped-up painting of Jesus. A Bible was left on the dead man’s chest, opened at the Letter of Jude. The killer had also arranged condoms, silver rings, a parking ticket and half eaten food around the crime scene in Thornbury, Gloucestershire. Four days later, the court heard, Farrow, who admits killing the vicar, sent a text from the clergyman’s mobile phone which read: ‘RIP Mr Suddards. Pervert.’ Bristol Crown Court was told that DNA evidence links Farrow to the murders of Mr Suddards and retired teacher Betty Yates, 77, as well as the burglary of a property in which a note was found threatening to kill ‘Christian scum’. Opening the case, prosecutor Michael Fitton QC, told the jury the three offences spanned a period of eight weeks, from December 21 to February 15. Farrow has admitted breaking into another country house in Thornbury weeks before he killed the vicar. He left a note to the owners pinned to their kitchen table with two knives. In bright pink pen, it read: ‘Be thankful you did not come back or we would have killed you Christian scum. I ****ing hate God.’ Farrow is accused of murdering Mrs Yates at her detached riverside home in Bewdley, Worcestershire, in the days after the burglary. He is alleged to have hit the grandmother on the back of the head with her own walking stick before stabbing her four times in the face and neck. She suffered a three-inch knife wound to the neck – hitting the jugular vein – from which the blade was later found protruding. Her body was found in a pool of blood at the bottom of her stairs. Rev John Suddards and teacher Betty Yates were both murdered in their homes at the start of this year . Murder scene: Aerial view of the scene in Thornbury, South Gloucestershire, where Reverend John Suddards was found dead on February 16 . Mr Fitton said: ‘There are no injuries to suggest she had any opportunity to defend herself. ‘She may have been struck from behind without any opportunity to defend herself from her attacker.’ He continued: ‘She has not been killed by the beating in a straight line to the back of the head. ‘The weapon with which she appears to have been felled appears to be one of her own walking sticks. ‘There were in total four stab wounds to the neck and head. The most significant was to the left side of the neck. ‘It cut through the left jugular vein and was measured to be seven and a half centimetres.’ The walking stick used to beat her over the head – which had splintered because of the level of force used – had been placed upside down in her walking stick holder, it was said. An officer stands guard as floral tributes are left at the home where the Rev John Suddards was murdered . The court heard that Farrow, who was allegedly spotted walking along the riverbank by two women on January 2, knew the area well from fishing on the Severn. The jury heard that Farrow was linked to the scene of Mrs Yates’s murder by DNA on her hand and a boot print that was left on an exercise mat. The same boot marks linked Farrow to the break-in in  Thornbury where the scrawled note was left referring to ‘Christian scum’. Mr Fitton said the message offered ‘a disturbing insight into the mind of whoever wrote it’. He added that Farrow travelled around much of the country, staying in ‘all sorts of accommodation’ and occasionally slept rough. The home of retired schoolteacher, 77-year-old Betty Yates, who was found dead just after New Year . Six weeks after Mrs Yates’s murder, the drifter returned to Thornbury and went on to kill Mr Suddards, the court heard. After inflicting multiple stab wounds to the vicar’s face, neck and chest, Farrow carefully arranged a ‘scene’ around the vicar’s body with objects he found by ransacking his home, it was said. ‘Over the legs of the deceased was arranged a calendar and over the body were streamers discharged from party poppers,’ said Mr Fitton. ‘In order to find all these items and distribute them over the body the defendant has trawled through the house. ‘It is obviously what the effect is – to spoil and harm the reputation and memories of those who loved and knew the Reverend John Suddards.’ Mr Suddards’s body was  discovered on the morning of February 14 after workmen arrived at the vicarage. Farrow, who is of no fixed abode, was arrested in Folkestone, Kent, after a nationwide appeal. He admits the manslaughter of Mr Suddards on the grounds of diminished responsibility but denies murder. He also denies the murder of Mrs Yates, but admits breaking into the house where the note was found. The trial continues.

"By . Martin Robinson . Buckingham Palace is employing hundreds of staff on controversial ‘zero-hour’ contracts, it was revealed yesterday. Around 350 temporary employees are given no guaranteed income under the deal, and cannot work elsewhere without permission. Use of the contracts has become widespread despite calls for them to be banned. It has emerged that employees at other national institutions – including cafe workers at the Tate art galleries and 3,700 staff at the National Trust – are also on the deals, meaning that workers at many of Britain’s grandest stately homes are not guaranteed a single hour’s paid employment. Popular: People queue every year to enter Buckingham Palace for its annual Summer Opening, but it emerged today temporary staff are on controversial zero-hours contracts . Exhibition: This year Queen Elizabeth II's Coronation Dress and Robe will be shown to the public to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Her Majesty's Coronation . The contracts have proved popular with . employers as they do not set a minimum number of hours that have to be . worked, allowing firms to draft in extra staff at short notice during . busy periods. Annual event: The Queen's London home is opened every summer and is run by the Palace subsidiary the Royal Collection Trust . But trade unions have warned that some . employers have used them to deny basic rights to workers. Those . employed under the contracts say they do not know if or when they will . be working from one week to the next, making family and childcare . commitments impossible. Buckingham Palace uses the contracts for temporary staff working in its shop and the State Rooms during the summer. A spokesman for the Royal Collection . Trust, which employs the temporary workforce, denied that the deal . equated to a zero-hour contract. She conceded that employees were not . guaranteed work but said rotas were issued around a month in advance, . meaning workers could plan around their hours. A copy of a staff contract from 2009 . stated: ‘Your hours of work will be advised by the visitor manager and . will be dependent upon the requirements for retail assistants at . Buckingham Palace as and when required.’ The Palace argues that because staff . receive advance notice of their working hours and benefits, including . free lunches and holiday pay, they are not on zero-hour deals. Those . working for longer than three months are eligible for sick pay, with . pension entitlements starting after six months. Rooms like this banquet hall in the Palace are monitored by some staff who are not guaranteed to be paid in their contracts . Argument: The Palace, which has some buildings and grounds open each summer, said today these are not zero-hours deals although there are not hours set out on the contracts . At the National Trust, the majority of . seasonal staff are employed on zero-hour contracts. A spokesman said . they were offered the same job security, pay and benefits as any other . employee who had worked the same amount of time for the trust and . managers are urged to set rotas well in advance. ‘Our properties have told us it is . important to be able to reorganise rotas quickly to respond to the . weather and zero-hour contracts allow us to do that,’ he said. Uncertainty: Some 90 per cent of workers at 396 stores are now on zero-hour contracts with the company . Catering staff at the Tate galleries . in London, Liverpool and St Ives in Cornwall are on similar deals. A . spokesman for Tate Enterprises Ltd said it did not prevent the . contracted employees from working elsewhere. Earlier this week it was revealed that . 20,000 staff at Sports Direct, which is controlled by founder Mike . Ashley, were also employed under the same practice. The Government is reviewing their use. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said they could ‘cause intense anxiety and insecurity’.","Around 350 temps don't get guaranteed hours or holiday pay .

"By . Chris Brooke . Lydia Bishop died on her first day of nursery . A toddler died on her first day at nursery school when she was left to play alone on a slide known to be  dangerous, a court heard yesterday. Lydia Bishop became entangled in a ‘loop’  at the top of the slide. It tightened around her neck and choked her as she slid down. No children were allowed to be in the play area alone, but it was 20 minutes before the three-year-old was found by a member of staff. She was ‘blue’ and not breathing and efforts to revive her failed, Leeds Crown Court was told. Lydia died just five hours after being dropped off by her parents at the nursery at York College. Prosecutor Robert Smith, QC, told the jury there was a ‘tick-box mentality’ at the nursery, with staff focusing on ‘excellent’ paperwork rather than ensuring safety rules were adhered to. He added: ‘Compliance with health and safety law was done on paper but not in practice.’ Sophee Redhead, 25, was one of the nursery staff supervising Lydia and saw her walk in the direction of the slide, but did nothing to stop or supervise her, it was alleged. She denies manslaughter by gross negligence and an alternative health and safety charge of failing to take ‘reasonable care’ of the little girl. York College, which owns the nursery, is also on trial and has denied failing to ensure people not in its employment are not exposed to a risk to their health and safety. Scroll down for video . Incident: Lydia Bishop was found blue and not breathing after she got her neck caught in a rope on a slide in the outdoor play area at York College's nursery, pictured, Leeds Crown Court heard . On trial: Sophee Redhead arriving at Leeds Crown Court last week, has denied a charge of manslaughter over the death of the three-year-old girl . On the day of the tragedy in September 2012, staff had placed a makeshift barrier across the path leading to the slide in a ‘futile attempt’ to stop children going there unsupervised. The nursery regularly used ropes for play, but risk assessments had identified the potential danger of strangulation from rope attached to the slide. Strict rules – posted on the nursery walls – stated no  children should play on the slide without adult supervision and the rope should be put away when staff were not there. The tragedy happened when most of the children were enjoying a snack. Disturbing CCTV images played in court showed Lydia walking down the path at 2.05pm and climbing the steps to the slide. The camera – positioned behind the slide – shows ‘slight movement’ at the top and Lydia isn’t seen again. Almost 20 minutes later a member of staff realised Lydia was missing and asked Redhead to check outside. Sophee Redhead denies manslaughter by gross negligence and the alternative charge under health and safety legislation of failing to take 'reasonable care' of the little girl . Bosses: York College - which operated the nursery for children of staff, students and members of the public - denies failing to ensure people not in their employment are not exposed to a risk to their health and safety . Redhead is seen on CCTV at 2.26pm running towards the slide and carrying the lifeless girl back. Describing finding Lydia on the slide, she said: ‘Her head was about six inches from the top of the slide. As I got to the slide I could see that a loop of rope was round her neck.’ A doctor said Lydia could have recovered if she had been found after a few minutes. The trial continues.

The champion was admitted to the . University of Grenoble hospital on December 29 after suffering . significant brain injuries after striking a rock while skiing off-piste. Dr Greenwood spoke at a conference looking into the long-term effects. ‘If Schumacher . survives he will not be Schumacher. He will be Joe Bloggs,’ said . Greenwood. ‘His rehabilitation will only be effective if he comes to terms with being Bloggs, and fulfils what Bloggs can do.

However, the claims have been refuted by his management team in the first official update on his condition in over a week. ‘Unfortunately, .

Chinese family members who flew to Malaysia to be . closer to the heart of search operations had been staying at the .

He told ABC News that the families were fluctuating between hope that their relatives might be alive, and despair at the thought that they may never be found. Mr Yin added that many were latching on to wild rumours and conspiracy theories in a bid to find solace. 'In the Chinese culture when a person gets to a certain age, the meaning of life is about your grandchildren - your legacy,' he said.

"By . Paul Donnelley . America is the land of the free but not all of its citizens are happy with that. A petition has been launched on the White House website calling for Alaska to leave the United States and rejoin Russia. The application, ‘Alaska Back to Russia’, was created by ‘S.V.’ of Anchorage, and in under a week it has already received nearly 30,000 signatures.

We want to be Russian: The petition on the White House website asking for Alaska to be returned to Russia . Alaska became the 49th state of the union on January 3, 1959. The strangely worded petition begins ‘Groups Siberian russians (sic) crossed the Isthmus (now the Bering Strait) 16-10 thousand years ago’ and continues ‘Russian began to settle on the Arctic coast, Aleuts inhabited the Aleutian Archipelago.

The White House responds to any petition that receives 100,000 signatures in 30 days and the Alaska one is running considerably short – the deadline is April 20. In 2012, a similar petition was raised calling for Texas to leave the union and it did reach the 100,000 mark. A White House spokesman at the time said: ‘Our states remain united. Our founding fathers established the Constitution of the United States “in order to form a more perfect union”… they did not provide a right to walk away from it.’ In any case, following the American Civil War (1861-1865) the Supreme Court ruled that unilateral secession is unconstitutional. All-American view: Mount McKinley, Denali National Park, Alaska . Alaska became a U.S. territory in 1867 when it was purchased by William Seward, the Secretary of State, at 4am on March 30 after an all-night discussion with Russia, a country that was then in financial difficulty. It feared losing the territory in a possible conflict and preferred to make some money from its sale. The price was $7.2m or about 2¢ an acre. With the purchase of Alaska, the United States acquired an area twice as large as Texas. Initially, the deal was thought to be a mistake and the huge wilderness became known as ‘Seward’s Folly’. Then during the Klondike gold strike in 1896 it was discovered that the land was rich in resources such as gold, copper, and oil and its proximity to the Soviet Union was useful during the Cold War. Originally the Department of Alaska, the area became the District of Alaska and then Alaska Territory in May 1912 before being admitted to the union as a state in 1959.","Petition has 30 days to reach 100,000 signatures for White House response .

Professor Thao Shirley Nguyen has since refused to confirm what student Lauren Firmin alleges that she told the class, while officials at the Lonestar College-University Park in Harris County, Texas, also deny any wrong doing. Firmin said she was a student with a 4.0 grade average, but found herself unexpectedly struggling with the subject during the Fall 2013 semester. Scroll down for video . Student Lauren Firmin claims that her 4.0 grade average was ruined because her chemistry teacher taught the wrong level and caused her to only get a B grade . Professor Thao Shirley Nguyen is accused by one of her students of teaching an advanced chemistry class rather than an introductory-level course that students had signed up for . ‘I was getting 40’s on every test,’ Firmin told KHOU. ‘I studied as hard as I could, did everything in my power to try.’ Then, shortly before the class’ final exam, Firmin claims that Nguyen admitted to teaching the wrong course all semester. ‘She told her mistake in class to all of the students,’ said Firmin. Nguyen told students she would add extra credit to their grades to compensate for her mistake. For Firmin that meant her F grade became a B, but still ruined her straight A, 4.0 grade point average. ‘4.0 students, we are really stressed out altogether, but this just added to it to see what I have been working for, for two years destroyed,’ she said. Tight-lipped:  Professor Ngeyen has refused to comment on the allegations since her student spoke out about it . Administrators at Lonestar College-University Park in Harris County, Texas, have denied that a lecturer taught the wrong subject for an entire semester . When KHOU tracked Nguyen down she refused to comment on the story, while college administrator John Powell said the teacher had ‘followed the syllabus and taught from the 1405 textbook’. But this explanation doesn’t tally with an email from the head of the college’s science department that Firmin received when she complained about Nguyen. ‘This was not intentional on Ms. Nguyen’s part,’ the science chair wrote. ‘She was new to the introductory level of material and did not realize it until just a week ago. 'Ms Nguyen has made every effort to be fair in the distribution of the grades and I am confident that she will assign the grades justly.

Her friend Keyana Linbo, also 15, remains in hospital but is in a stable state. It is believed that the trio were travelling in a plane to Florida for a spring break trip . Scroll down for video . Both Jeffrey Bronken (right) and his daughter Katherine have now died following the crash on Saturday . Deadly: Investigators look at the wreckage of a small passenger plane which crashed early Saturday, killing a 53-year-old man and injuring two teen girls. Katherine Bronken has since died. Friend Keyana Linbo remains in hospital . It is believed that Jeffrey Bronken and his 15-year-old daughter were travelling to Florida for a spring break trip . Reports from the Pinellas County Sherrif's Office, in Florida, have been released confirming the teenager's death. The family was first struck by tragedy in 2009 when it is believed that Jeffrey Bronken's daughter Christine was killed during a fatal snowmobile crash. Christine Bronken's death was listed in records from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. The trio, all from Chicago suburb Round . Lake, were headed to nearby St Petersburg – Clearwater International . Airport when the plane crashed around 4 a.m., WTSP reported. Authorities told Bay News 9 that the single-engine Piper knocked out power to locals after clipping power lines on its way down. The plane crashed on a busy six-lane road in the town of Safety Harbor, just across the bay from Tampa. No other injuries were caused by the accident, and investigators have yet to determine a cause behind the crash. Katherine Bronken fought for her life for four days before her tragic death last night . The Bronken family was struck by tragedy in 2009 when Christine Bronken, 20, the pilot's daughter was killed in a snowmobile accident . ‘This happened at 4 a.m., so luckily, no one was on the road at that time in this vicinity,’ Pinellas County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt. David DiSano told Bay News 9. The red and white plane left Chicago around 6.30 Friday night, officials said. The National Transportation Safety Board said that Mr Bronken had reported a fuel problem to air traffic control before the plane went down. The exact cause of the crash still remains unknown but the fuel problem is being investigated. Best friends: Both Katherine Bronken (left) and Keyana Linbo (right) were aboard the flight. Miss Linbo is in a stable state at a Tampa hospital. Miss Bronken died on Wednesday . Crumpled: An investigator from the FAA takes photographs of the small single-engine plane . A neighbor of the Bronken’s confirmed to the Chicago Tribune that widow Susan Bronken was already headed to Florida. A life-long friend of the family Ken Hoxie told WLS: 'It's a shock. It's a shame. It's a fantastic family. 'You don't understand sometimes why these things happen, all we can do is pray.' People near the site of the crash described the sights and sounds that woke them early Saturday morning to the Tampa Bay Times. Marina Brown, 20, said she heard a loud noise and saw a flash of light followed by sparks. It looked like ‘fireworks shooting up from the ground,’ according to Mary Pronesti. Bill Tregulas said it sounded ‘like a large guitar snapping.’ Another person told Bay News 9 that he head a ‘big boom,’ saw a flash of light and initially dismissed it as a thunder storm. Emergency responders from several agencies responded quickly to the scene. Both father and daughter died as a result of the crash. Widow Susan Bronken is believed to have travelled to Florida after the crash . Also injured: Keyana Linbo was also hurt. The 15-year-old is now in a stable state at a Tampa hospital . The cause of the crash which killed Jeffrey Bronken and his daughter Katherine is still under investigation . The aircraft never caught fire, but several small fires along the median where it came to rest nose-first with its tail in the air were put out by firefighters. More than 1,100 households lost power immediately after the deadly crash, but that numbers was reduced to about 450 by 6 a.m. according to the Tampa Tribune. The airport the trio was flying to is less than a mile from the scene.","Jeffrey Bronken, 53, pronounced dead at scene near Tampa, Florida .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Taking just 2,000 extra steps a day could help people prone to heart attacks and stroke cut their risk by eight per cent, claim researchers. The exercise is equivalent to walking 20 minutes a day at a moderate pace, says a study in The Lancet medical journal (must credit). The health benefits are gained by anyone doing 2,000 extra steps for a year on top of their normal levels of activity. Healthy: Taking just 2,000 extra steps a day could help people prone to heart attacks and stroke cut their risk by eight per cent, claim researchers . But doing 4,000 extra steps - 40 minutes of additional daily walking - matches the benefits from taking a statin, says study leader Dr Thomas Yates, of the Diabetes Research Unit at Leicester University. He said ‘Doing 4,000 extra steps a day reduces your cardiovascular risk by about 16-20 per cent, which is the equivalent of taking a statin. ‘However, a statin has side effects and only reduces cholesterol, whereas walking has a much bigger range of health benefits.’ The study looked at 9,306 adults from 40 countries who had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), which can lead to diabetes, or other heart disease risk factors. Using a pedometer, researchers recorded usual walking activity in terms of average number of steps taken per day over a week, both at the start of the study and again 12 months later. The researchers analysed the relationship between the number of steps taken per day and the risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease after taking account of a wide range of factors such as body-mass index, smoking status, diet, clinical history, and medication use. Altogether 531 cardiovascular events such as heart attacks were recorded. Pacing: Using a pedometer, researchers recorded usual walking activity in terms of average number of steps taken per day over a week . The study showed those people with greater levels of activity at the start of the study had lower levels of risk, and that doing more walking during the year-long study cut the risk still further. It found that every additional 2000 steps taken a day over one year-roughly equivalent to 20 min a day of moderately-paced walking-reduces the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke by eight per cent. Dr Yates said one in eight people is affected by poor blood sugar control, putting them at risk of heart-related events. Benefits: Doing 4,000 extra steps a day reduces cardiovascular risk by about 16-20 per cent, which is the equivalent of taking a statin . He said ‘This is the first study to specifically quantify the extent to which change in walking behaviour can modify the risk of heart disease, stroke, and cardiovascular-related deaths. ‘Our results provide novel evidence that changing physical activity levels through simply increasing the number of steps taken can substantially reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, such as heart attack and stroke. ‘Importantly, these benefits are seen regardless of bodyweight status or the starting level of activity. ‘These novel findings provide the strongest evidence yet for the importance of physical activity in high risk populations and will inform diabetes and cardiovascular disease prevention programmes worldwide.’ Dr Richard Elliot, research communications officer at Diabetes UK charity, said ‘This study adds to the wealth of evidence that regular physical activity can help to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems such as stroke and heart disease in people at high risk of Type 2 diabetes. ‘Though the study was limited by missing data and doesn’t explain why this is happening, it is encouraging to see that simple, easy-to-make changes - such as an extra 20 minutes of walking a day - were linked to such a significant impact on health, and that these benefits appeared to grow as activity increased. ‘Further trials looking at the direct impact of physical activity are now needed to back up these results.’ Julie Ward, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said ‘Getting plenty of exercise has many health benefits and helps to lower your risk of cardiovascular disease. This is particularly important for people with diabetes as they are already at greater risk of heart attacks and stroke. ‘We should all aim for 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise each week. This means any activity which makes you feel warmer, breathe harder and makes your heart beat faster than normal. ‘If 150 minutes sounds intimidating, remember it can be broken up into smaller chunks. After all, the 2,000 steps in this study equates to roughly 20 minutes of moderately-paced walking, so even a brisk walk in your lunch break will count.’","Exercise is equivalent to walking 20 minutes a day at a moderate pace .

Nasa is inviting people to have their names etched into a microchip aboard a spacecraft heading to asteroid Bennu in 2016. The ‘Messages to Bennu!’ microchip will travel to the asteroid aboard the agency's Origins-Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft. Nasa is inviting people to have their names etched into a microchip aboard a spacecraft heading to asteroid Bennu in 2016. This is an artist's representation of what the mission could look like . The robotic mission will spend more than two years at the 1,760 ft (500 metre)-wide asteroid. The spacecraft will collect a sample of Bennu's surface and return it to Earth in a sample return capsule. One microchip will be brought back to Earth. Another copy will remain in outer space long after the sample has landed. Those wishing to participate in ‘Messages to Bennu!’ can submit their names here by September 30. OSIRIS-REx will spend more than two years at the 1,760 ft (500 metre)-wide asteroid, named Bennu. It plans to return an asteroid sample to Earth to reveal the origins of volatiles and organics that may be the seeds of life . The OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security and Regolith Explorer) mission aims to address basic questions about the composition of the very early solar system. The probe will spend more than two years at the 1,760 ft (500 metre)-wide asteroid, named Bennu. It plans to return an asteroid sample to Earth to reveal the origins of volatiles and organics that may be the seeds of life. Scientists also hope the mission will accelerate technology that will soon enable humans to mine asteroids for precious metals. The spacecraft, scheduled for launch in September 2016, will arrive at the asteroid Bennu in October 2018. It will travel 406,618,624 miles (654,389,243 km) to reach the asteroid. After a person submits their name, they will be able to download and print a certificate documenting their participation in the OSIRIS-REx mission. The OSIRIS-REx mission goal is to address basic questions about the composition of the very early solar system, the source of organic materials and water that made life possible on Earth. It also hopes to better predict the orbits of asteroids that represent collision threats to the Earth. It will collect a minimum of two ounces (60g) of surface material. Scientists claim the mission will accelerate technology that will soon enable humans to mine asteroids for precious metals. Nasa scientists believe the high concentration of raw materials found in asteroids - such as ingredients for fuel and precious metals like iron and platinum - could supply Earth with vital stockpiles of natural resources. Once the sample return capsule deploys, the spacecraft will be placed into a long-term solar orbit around the sun, along with the microchip and every name on it. ‘It is exciting to consider the possibility that some of the people who register to send their names to Bennu could one day be a part of the team that analyses the samples from the asteroid 10 years from now,’ said Jason Dworkin, mission project scientist at Nasa.","Microchip will travel aboard the agency's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft in 2016 .

"By . Ashley Collman . Lauryn Lax was on the brink of death when a group of nine strangers at her gym staged an intervention for the 23-year-old anorexic graduate student three years ago. Five-foot-four Lax weighed just 79 pounds the morning the group stopped her in the parking lot of the Green Hills YMCA In Nashville and took her to Vanderbilt University Medical Center for help. In a phone interview with MailOnline, Lax confessed that she struggled with the eating disorder for more than a decade, and had been hospitalized a dozen or more times. But it was that much needed 'wake-up call' by the group of mere acquaintances that led her to finally get healthy. Graduate student Lauryn Lax was saved from near-certain death after a group of strangers at her YMCA staged an intervention when they noticed how dangerously thin she was getting. Above, Lax (in blue) reunited with some of her 'Angels' Frank Grant and his wife Louise were two . of the YMCA members involved in the intervention, and had noticed the . girl working out religiously - sometimes multiple times a day - at the . gym for quite sometime. Before they learned her name, they called her 'that girl' in conversations until they finally got the courage to say something. Suffering: Lauryn hit rock bottom in August 2011, when she stepped on the scale and saw that she was just 79 pounds . Mrs Grant was the first to make the move. On a Monday morning, she approached Lax as she was walking from the upstairs workout area to a downstairs weight machine. 'I know we don't know each other,' Mrs Grant recalled to the Tennessean. 'I have to tell you that I would like to get you some help. I believe that you have an eating disorder, and I really want to do something to help you.' Lax rebuffed Mrs Grant's concerns, saying she was OK and had received counseling. Little did she know that Lax had with Anorexia nervosa since elementary school when a popular girl asked her how much she weighed at the age of 10. By the time Lax was in the seventh-grade she had to be admitted to a inpatient program, and had to seek treatment again when she was a freshman at the University of Texas. She hit her rock bottom weight in August 2011 after moving to Tennessee to attend graduate school at Belmont University and the members at her gym decided to voice their concerns. 'It was just a struggle to even work out 30 minutes less or to make myself eat a teaspoon of almond butter more,' Lax said. The day after Mrs Grant's initial conversation with Lax, the members started getting more serious about their intervention. They found out Lax's first name from someone at the front desk, and another member was already a friend of Lax's on Facebook. Stopped: After unsuccessfully offering help, a group of nine staged an intervention in the parking lot of the Green Hills YMCA, before Lax could go in for her morning workout.They then proceeded to take her to the hospital for emergency treatment . In a good place: Lauryn, pictured with her father above, went into treatment for 11 months after the intervention and is now at a healthy weight - though she doesn't step on the scale anymore or count calories . From there they were able to track . down Lax's father on the social networking site, and the very next day . Mrs Grant and gym-member Susie Bateman called up Mike Lax to voice their . concerns. Friends forever: Though she doesn't live in Nashville anymore, Lax reunited with her 'angels' ever time she's in town and they are planning a party to celebrate her graduation in May . On . Wednesday morning, the Grants and Bateman banded together with L'Taya . Bell, Judith Hill, Andy Clough, Bob Johnson, Fields Stringfellow and . Johnny Phipps  to arrive at the gym early before Lax started her . workout. The . group persuaded Lax to go with them to Vanderbilt University Medical . Center and she nearly talked her way out of being admitted. However, her . Dad called ahead warning the hospital staff that his daughter would not . cooperate. 'We . couldn't help her,' said Mike Lax said. 'We were so close to it for so . long. We had just been to Nashville three weeks before the intervention. We came to Nashville the last week of July and really got in the car . and cried on the way home. We didn't know if she was going to make it.' Had the strangers decided to not say anything to Lax, she probably wouldn't be alive today. Lax spent three days in intensive care and three and a half weeks in a cardiac unit because her heart beat had slowed down to such dangerous levels doctors were considering surgery to install a pacemaker. But Lax recovered, though she spent nearly a year in treatment working towards a healthy weight. She spent most of the 11 months at a treatment center in Miami, aided by the long-distance support of her cheerleaders back at the YMCA. Lax says she received constant letters, emails and Facebook messages from the group which really helped her stick with treatment. Three years later, Lax says she no longer pays attention to her weight and doesn't count calories. And though she no longer lives in Nashville, she remains close to the nine 'angels' who stepped up to save her life.. The group reunited nearly every time she is in town, and they are planning a party to celebrate Lax's graduation from Belmont in May. 'I consider them some of my greatest friends in Nashville... I think our hearts kind of bonded through that experience,' Lax told MailOnline. After graduation in May, Lax hopes to find work helping other people struggling with eating disorders.","Lauryn Lax weighed just 79 pounds in August 2011 when a group at her gym staged an intervention .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Despite technology making it possible for us to speak to anyone around the world at any time, new research has found we still predominantly choose to communicate with people who live geographically nearby. By studying data from mobile network operators across Europe, Africa and Saudi Arabia, scientists highlighted that north-south divides as well as historical boundaries are still present. In particular, it found that in the UK, only 9.5 per cent of communication between people living in both the North and the South of the country crossed a dividing line situated 100 miles north of London. Patterns reveal we still only predominantly talk to people who live in certain geographical areas, and highlighted north-south divides, and historical boundaries, can determine this spread of communication. This graphic shows the spread of calls made in Portugal, with the boundaries highlighted in different colours . According to research from Skype, British living rooms contain £23.5 billion of internet-connected devices, yet many use them to talk to people within the same house. The study found that almost half (48 per cent) use instant messaging services while watching television. More than a quarter (28 per cent) of people use devices to contact other people in the same household. This figure rises to 45 per cent among student and 18 to 24-year-olds. Elsewhere, Belgium has a history of linguistic and social divide between the Flemish-speaking Flanders region, in the north, and French-speaking Wallonia, in the south. Researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who conducted the study, found that only 3.5 per cent of communications take place between these regions. In Italy, only 7.8 per cent of communications cross a line roughly along the northern border of the Emilio-Romagna region. These invisible borders, the researchers say, ‘help us grasp the social, civic, and commercial interactions that exist in contemporary nations, and may be of use to government officials and other policy experts.’ ‘We are looking at networks to think about how communities are structured over space,’ said Carlo Ratti, an associate professor in MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning. Belgium has a history of linguistic and social divide between the Flemish-speaking Flanders region, in the north, and French-speaking Wallonia, in the south, pictured. According to the study, only 3.5 per cent of communications took place between these regions and crossed this historical boundary . The study is part of a larger effort, he added, to see ‘how we can use these technologies to better understand the extent of constituencies and communities.’ In addition to the UK, Italy, and Belgium, the researchers studied communication patterns in France, Portugal, the Ivory Coast, and Saudi Arabia. They used anonymous data from network operators BT, Orange, Telecom Italia and the Saudia Telecom Company. The researchers mapped the connections in two iterations: first at a larger scale, and then at a more local level, to see network patterns across and within regions and communities. This highlighted that in France, for example, patterns of communication closely mirrored the nation’s historical administrative regions.Yet the data also revealed a larger east-west divide running almost the length of the country. According to co-author Stanislav Sobolevsky: ‘The findings show that, for all the digital connectivity in civic life today, people still connect in a geographically cohesive, connected set of communities. The researchers claim this kind of mapping could be useful for governments when discussing political or administrative boundaries. It could also be used for market analysis or other forms of research. ‘We’re more interested in the theory behind it,’ Ratti said, ‘and in how this can contribute to a ‘science of cities.’’ The findings are published in the journal PLoS ONE.","Study looked at communication patterns in EU, Africa and Saudi Arabia .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The next generation of safety technologies designed to reduce the number of road accidents, have been revealed at the Frankfurt motor show. TRW Automotive used a life size acrylic car 'driven' by models to demonstrate how it is working towards semi-automated driving as well as other new technology innovations to keep drivers and car passengers safe. The company believes cars will be packed with more intelligent safety systems in the next decade that can anticipate road conditions. TRW Automotive used a life size acrylic car 'driven' by models to demonstrate how it is working towards semi-automated driving as well as other new technology innovations . TRW Automotive showed off a range of airbags and active safety systems such as braking and steering products in the acrylic car, which also highlights the sensors that are used to collect information from 360 degrees around the vehicle. The data from the sensors is used to make driver assist systems work in a bid to protect drivers, passengers and pedestrians in emergency situations. Included in the acrylic car is an advanced radar that can be used to warn drivers of possible collisions and pedestrians, as well as spark mitigation braking and emergency braking. A new 'active' seat belt system is fitted in the vehicle but in a real car that is forced to stop suddenly, it could help manage occupant energy during a crash. The new seatbelts can reduce slack in driving situations and decrease the possibility of passengers being out of position and more susceptible to injury, the company said. The company believes cars will be packed with more intelligent safety systems in the next decade, some of which it showed off in its car at the Frankfurt motor show . An integrated brake control system (IBC) enables a car to automatically brake and recover energy from braking in one package. The company said it offers 'improved pedal feel' and performance over conventional systems with a lower overall weight. Another feature shown off in the vehicle is an electrically powered steering system that offers fuel-saving benefits and factors in wind compensation, for example. TRW Automotive showed off an advanced radar in its acrylic car that can be used to warn drivers of possible collisions and pedestrians, as well as spark mitigation braking and emergency braking. The see-through car highlights lots of different safety systems including airbags . John Plant, chairman and CEO of TRW Automotive, said: 'Over the next decade, active safety systems will become increasingly intelligent as greater efforts are made to reduce the number of road fatalities worldwide. 'More automated functions will be introduced that will operate continuously in certain situations in addition to providing emergency support when needed.' He believes consumers will benefit from more cars being fitted with active safety technologies as changes to road safety schemes and insurance incentives come into force across the world. TRW currently supplies safety technologies to car manufacturers including VW, Mercedes Benz, Ford, General Motors and Toyota. The company's stand at the automotive show also used holographic films to showcase its new technologies.

"By . Ryan Gorman . An upstate New York surgeon and his hospital are being accused of greed and negligence in a series of malpractice lawsuits. Dr. Spyros Panos, formerly a surgeon at Saint Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., are facing hundreds of malpractice lawsuits over accusations he sliced people open and sewed them back up without actually performing any procedures, or that he performed the wrong surgery . Scheduling as many as 22 surgeries a day, an almost unheard of workload, Panos was billing for work never completed and his out of control greed resulted in the death of a 76-year-old woman, one of the lawsuits alleges. Under fire: Dr. Spyros Panos is accused of performing 'phantom surgeries' on dozens of patients, and is blamed at least one known death . Panos reportedly would schedule up to 22 . surgeries a day, most surgeons only schedule 32 procedures a month, . according to industry statistics quoted by ABC News. Debra Nenni McNamee alleges that in 2009 Panos was to have performed surgery on her 76-year-old mother Constance Nenni’s left knee to repair damage caused by arthritis, according to ABC. Panos is said to have described the procedure as ‘a simple in and out.’ The procedure involved a small camera being inserted into Nenni’s knee to help clean out any dead or damaged tissue found, a fairly routine procedure. McNamee claims that less than 24 hours after the surgery, Nenni died of a pulmonary embolism said to have been caused by a blood clot that broke free and blocked the lung’s main artery, according to reports. Though not a common occurrence from knee surgery, older adults are more prone to such complications from any type of surgery. The Dutchess County (NY) medical examiner’s report, purportedly, is what did Panos in. Tragic: Constance Nenni, second from left, is alleged to have died as a result of negligence on the part of Panos . Panos allegedly had fudged all the post-surgery notes related to the six procedures he had performed on the family patriarch. The medical examiner's autopsy showed no evidence that he had ever removed torn cartilage, smoothed areas of excess wear or removed soft tissue from within the knee joint – he simply opened and closed her knee without so much as a single bit of repair, the Poughkeepsie Journal originally reported. ‘He put her under anesthesia, placed the scope in her knee and then closed her up without performing any surgery,’ Brian Brown, McNamee’s lawyer told ABC. ‘The reports showed no hardware in place and, certainly, no evidence of a total knee reconstruction.’ McNamee’s case wasn’t a one-off, according to several reports. Former patients have brought a total of 250 malpractice suits against Mid-Hudson Medical Group, parent of Saint Francis and Vassar Hospitals, and Panos, according to reports. Both hospitals, located in Poughkeepsie, have declined on multiple occasions to comment, as has Panos. A message seeking comment left with Brent Fleming, Panos' attorney, was not returned. Evading liability?: Many are accusing the Mid-Hudson Medical Group, Panos' former employer, of trying to evade liability by attempting to transfer assets to Mount Kisco Medical Group . In another instance, Panos is accused of having performed the wrong surgery. Barbara Murphy was to have a broken collarbone fixed by Panos in 2010, instead he operated on her rotator cuff as if it was broken, despite there being no evidence to suggest that procedure was necessary, she told the Journal. Dismissed: Mid-Hudson Medical Group dismissed Panos over the alleged malpractices . Making matters even worse, the Mid-Hudson Medical Group is in the midst of a deal that some believe is an effort to evade liability over Panos, who has since been fired and is also under a federal investigation. Rival Mount Kisco Medical Group and Mid-Hudson are trying combine assets in a transaction that will transfer ownership of current Mid-Hudson asset to Mount Kisco, leaving Mid-Hudson as nothing more than a shell company that would eventually dissolve, according to the Journal. Though both sides are adamant the merger is about providing the best care to patients in the region, not everyone is convinced. ‘They are taking what’s valuable and will leave a defunct shell,’ said JT Wisell, an attorney representing 152 plaintiffs suing Panos. Explaining that Mount Kisco would take Mid-Hudson’s doctors, and its revenue, financial expert Stephen Schulman told the paper that ‘you can’t sue someone with no money.’","Dr. Spyros Panos and Mid-Hudson Medical Group are named in over 200 malpractice lawsuits .
